## Question

can i prescribe estrogen patch in obese menopausal patient for HRT

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether prescribing a transdermal estrogen patch is appropriate for an obese postmenopausal patient considering hormone therapy, and how to structure the decision and dosing strategy. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the patient's baseline VTE risk and how obesity modifies that risk. Then, I should verify how route of estrogen administration changes thrombotic risk. Next, I will review metabolic and cardiovascular considerations in obesity, including lipids and insulin resistance. After that, I need to check endometrial protection requirements and progestogen choice. I will then examine breast cancer risk and timing of initiation. Finally, I should confirm practical dosing, monitoring, and counseling points, and synthesize a recommendation with appropriate cautions and follow-up plans.

> Let me first confirm the baseline risk profile. Obesity independently increases VTE risk, and when combined with oral estrogen, the relative risk can rise substantially, with some analyses showing a multiplicative effect, so I need to ensure we do not inadvertently compound risks with an oral route in this setting [^113mneJB] [^112n1oEU].

> Wait, let me verify the route-specific thrombotic risk. Multiple guidelines and meta-analyses indicate that oral systemic estrogen increases VTE risk by roughly 2–3 fold, whereas transdermal estradiol does not appear to increase VTE risk, even in higher-risk groups such as those with obesity or thrombophilia, likely due to avoidance of first-pass hepatic effects on coagulation factors [^116jmHkf] [^113shUMa] [^113mneJB] [^111KiiBs].

> Hold on, I should also consider metabolic effects in obesity. Oral estrogen can worsen insulin resistance and adversely shift adipocytokines in women with metabolic syndrome, whereas transdermal estradiol has minimal impact on insulin resistance and may increase adiponectin, suggesting a more favorable metabolic profile in obese patients; this aligns with guidance to prefer transdermal therapy in metabolic syndrome and diabetes when MHT is indicated [^111ATmve] [^117FY8zc] [^115Mc8ar].

> I need to check cardiovascular and lipid considerations. Oral estrogen tends to raise triglycerides and can have proinflammatory hepatic effects, whereas transdermal estradiol has neutral or favorable effects on triglycerides and avoids hepatic first-pass stimulation of coagulation proteins; in patients with dyslipidemia or elevated triglycerides, transdermal therapy is preferred, and blood pressure should be controlled before initiating MHT [^113Z2fWy] [^115Mc8ar].

> Next, I should review endometrial protection. If the patient has a uterus, unopposed estrogen increases the risk of endometrial hyperplasia and cancer, so I must pair estrogen with an appropriate progestogen; micronized progesterone or dydrogesterone are reasonable options with favorable coagulation profiles, and a levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system is an effective alternative that minimizes systemic progestogen exposure, particularly relevant in obesity where endometrial risk is higher [^1112e2de] [^113mneJB].

> Let me consider breast cancer risk and timing. Starting systemic MHT around the time of menopause is associated with higher breast cancer risk than starting later, and combined estrogen–progestin regimens carry greater risk than estrogen alone; however, estrogen-only therapy shows little excess risk in obese women, likely due to higher baseline adipose-derived estrogens, so route and regimen choice should be individualized and duration minimized [^113hUXE6] [^115pWqCa] [^113gYZXi].

> I should double-check practical dosing and product selection. For transdermal estradiol, typical patch strengths range from 0.025 to 0.1 mg delivered weekly or twice weekly depending on the product; starting at the lowest effective dose and titrating to symptom control is advised, and FDA-approved products should be preferred over compounded hormones to ensure consistent absorption and dosing [^114AhonK] [^111hRojZ]. If absorption or adherence is a concern, serum estradiol can be checked to guide dose adjustments, especially with patches or gels [^1179ioFM].

> But wait, what about weight effects of MHT itself. I initially thought estrogen therapy might promote weight gain; hold on, I should verify that. Contemporary evidence suggests MHT does not increase weight and may modestly attenuate menopause-associated gains in abdominal fat, though the effect is small and lifestyle remains foundational; thus, weight concerns should not preclude appropriately indicated transdermal therapy [^1178jTBx] [^114xwaKY].

> Next, I should review counseling and monitoring. I need to ensure shared decision-making about VTE, breast, and endometrial risks, reinforce that transdermal estrogen is preferred in obesity, and plan annual reassessment of risks and benefits; I should also counsel on proper patch application, rotation of sites, and safe disposal, and arrange age-appropriate cancer screening and blood pressure and lipid monitoring as indicated [^114UWJ1K] [^116G73U5] [^112S4oM5].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the indication for MHT, screen for contraindications, and if treatment is appropriate, prescribe transdermal estradiol at the lowest effective dose with appropriate endometrial protection, while optimizing weight, blood pressure, and lipids; I will avoid oral estrogen in this obese patient because of the disproportionate VTE risk and less favorable metabolic effects, and I will revisit the regimen annually to keep duration as short as clinically acceptable [^113mneJB] [^116QZs7m] [^114UWJ1K].

Yes, you can prescribe a **transdermal estrogen patch** for an obese menopausal patient when HRT is indicated, but use the **lowest effective dose** and prefer the **transdermal route** to minimize VTE risk [^113mneJB] [^116QZs7m]. Transdermal estrogen is preferred in obesity because it **does not increase VTE risk** [^113shUMa] and has fewer adverse metabolic effects than oral estrogen [^111ATmve]. Always add a progestogen if the uterus is present [^1112e2de], and reassess risks and benefits annually [^114UWJ1K].

## Clinical considerations for estrogen patch use in obese menopausal patients

### Benefits of transdermal estrogen therapy

- **Symptom relief**: Effective for vasomotor symptoms, vaginal dryness, and mood disturbances [^111h2BZX].
- **Bone health**: Preserves bone density and reduces fracture risk [^1123uSfv].
- **Metabolic effects**: May improve insulin sensitivity and lipid profiles [^117FY8zc].

---

### Risks associated with estrogen therapy in obesity

- **Venous thromboembolism (VTE)**: Obesity independently increases VTE risk; oral estrogen further elevates this risk [^112n1oEU].
- **Cardiovascular disease**: Obesity increases cardiovascular risk; oral estrogen may exacerbate this [^117TijsH] [^111hZ8Sp].
- **Breast cancer**: Long-term estrogen-progestin therapy increases breast cancer risk [^113hUXE6].

---

## Evidence supporting transdermal estrogen use in obesity

- **VTE risk**: Transdermal estrogen does not increase VTE risk, even in obesity [^113shUMa] [^111KiiBs].
- **Metabolic profile**: Transdermal estrogen has minimal impact on insulin resistance and lipid metabolism [^111ATmve].
- **Guideline support**: Endocrine Society and NAMS recommend transdermal estrogen for patients with obesity or metabolic syndrome [^113mneJB].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

| **Guideline** | **Recommendation regarding estrogen therapy in obesity** |
|-|-|
| Endocrine Society | - Prefer transdermal estrogen at the lowest effective dose for patients with obesity or metabolic syndrome [^113mneJB] [^112S4oM5] |
| North American Menopause Society (NAMS) | - Transdermal estrogen is preferred in patients with obesity or metabolic syndrome [^notfound] |
| European Society of Endocrinology (ESE) | - Do not use estrogen therapy solely for weight reduction in obesity [^113GEhrv] |

---

## Practical clinical recommendations

- **Route of administration**: Prefer transdermal estrogen patches over oral preparations [^notfound].
- **Dose**: Use the lowest effective dose to minimize risks [^116QZs7m].
- **Progestogen**: Add progestogen if the uterus is present to prevent endometrial hyperplasia [^1112e2de].
- **Monitoring**: Regularly reassess cardiovascular risk, breast cancer risk, and symptom control [^114UWJ1K].

---

## Conclusion and clinical decision

Transdermal estrogen patches are appropriate for obese menopausal patients when HRT is indicated, with a **favorable risk-benefit profile** compared with oral estrogen. Use the lowest effective dose, add progestogen if the uterus is present, and monitor risks and benefits regularly.

### A comparison of oral and transdermal short-term estrogen therapy in postmenopausal women with metabolic syndrome [^111ATmve]. Fertility and Sterility (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine whether it would be preferable to prescribe oral or transdermal estrogen to symptomatic postmenopausal women with metabolic syndrome (MBS).

Design

Prospective, randomized study.

Setting

Academic medical center.

Patient(S)

Fifty obese postmenopausal women with MBS.

Intervention(S)

Women were randomized to receive either oral E(2) (oE(2), 1 mg/d) or transdermal E(2) (tE(2), 0.05 mg/d) for 3 months. Fasting blood was obtained before and after treatment for glucose, insulin, lipid profiles, the adipocytokines (adiponectin, leptin, and resistin), and a gastric peptide (ghrelin). In addition, a 75-g 2-hour oral glucose-tolerance and intravenous insulin-tolerance tests were performed before and after E(2).

Main Outcome Measure(S)

Changes in parameters of insulin resistance (IR), lipid profiles, and adipocytokine levels.

Result(S)

Mean serum concentrations of E(2) in women using oE(2) and tE(2) were 39.1 ± 5.6 and 49.2 ± 28.6 pg/mL, respectively. After oE(2), there was a statistically significant worsening of IR markers, including an increase in baseline insulin (15.28 ± 1.27 to 22.02 ± 2.40 microU/mL), a reduction in quantitative insulin-sensitivity check index (0.3177 ± 0.0043 to 0.2977 ± 0.0057), and an increase in homeostasis model assessment (3.96 ± 0.38 to 8.59 ± 2.08). The only significant change in the lipid profile was an increase in high-density-lipoprotein cholesterol (50.46 ± 2.34 vs. 55.08 ± 2.51 mg/dL). Leptin levels increased (81.43 ± 7.87 ng/mL to 94.10 ± 6.56 ng/mL), and adiponectin decreased nonsignificantly, resulting in an increased leptin-adiponectin ratio (12.56 ± 1.70 to 15.86 ± 2.24); resistin levels increased (9.37 ± 1.09 ng/mL to 11.72 ± 1.10 ng/mL); and baseline ghrelin levels decreased (701.64 ± 59.79 pg/mL to 581.72 ± 36.07 pg/mL). After tE(2), no significant changes in IR parameters occurred, except for a decrease in glucose-insulin ratio. There were no changes in lipid parameters. Leptin did not change (72.7 ± 9.3 ng/mL to 78.8 ± 7.9 ng/mL), whereas adiponectin levels showed statistically significant increase (7.97 ± 0.7 microg/mL vs. 9.96 ± 1.1 microg/mL), with no change in the leptin-adiponectin ratio. Resistin levels did not change significantly, and ghrelin levels decreased (888.52 ± 109.98 pg/mL vs. 579.04 ± 39.30 pg/mL).

Conclusion(S)

This short-term study suggests that oral E(2) may worsen IR and adipocytokine parameters, worsening cardiovascular risk. Transdermal E(2) had minimal effects on IR and resulted in higher adiponectin. Although these data may not reflect alterations that occur with estrogen therapy in more metabolically normal postmenopausal women or with longer term therapy, the findings suggest that tE(2) may be a preferable treatment for obese women with MBS. Long-term studies are needed to make any recommendations.

### Ovarian activity in obese and nonobese women treated with three transdermal contraceptive patches delivering three different doses of ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel [^114jeJY3]. Contraception (2013). Low credibility.

Background

The effect of obesity on ovarian follicular suppression in women using low-estrogen dose contraceptive patches has not been determined.

Study Design

A Phase II, parallel-group, multicenter, three-cycle study evaluated three patches containing different ethinyl estradiol (EE) and levonorgestrel (LNG) doses. Serum levels of EE, LNG, sex hormone-binding globulin and progesterone were compared in 41 obese [body mass index (BMI) ≥ 30] and 75 nonobese (BMI < 30) women.

Results

Suppression of ovulation during the luteal phase was dose dependent, with the highest dose (AG200–15) preventing progesterone increases in all women (cycles 2–3). In the follicular phase, the lowest-dose patch had the highest rate of increased progesterone in nonobese subjects. Progesterone levels ≥ 3.0 ng/mL in the follicular phase were more common in obese than nonobese women.

Conclusions

AG200–15 suppresses ovulation in obese and nonobese women. All three patches found increased progesterone in the follicular phase, albeit more in obese versus nonobese women.

### Type 2 diabetes mellitus and menopausal hormone therapy: an update [^117FY8zc]. Diabetes Therapy (2019). Medium credibility.

During menopausal transition, various phenotypical and metabolic changes occur, affecting body weight, adipose tissue distribution and energy expenditure as well as insulin secretion and sensitivity. Taken together, these can predispose women to the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Many women in midlife experience climacteric symptoms, including hot flashes and night sweats. Menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) is then indicated. MHT has a favourable effect on glucose homeostasis in both women without and with T2DM. T2DM was considered in the past as a cardiovascular disease (CVD) equivalent, which would suggest that women with T2DM should not receive MHT. This notion may still deter many clinicians from prescribing MHT to these patients. However, nowadays there is strong evidence to support an individualised approach after careful evaluation of CVD risk. In older women with T2DM (> 60 years old or > 10 years in menopause), MHT should not be initiated, because it may destabilise mature atherosclerotic plaques, resulting in thrombotic episodes. In obese women with T2DM or in women with moderate CVD risk, transdermal 17β-oestradiol could be used. This route of delivery presents beneficial effects regarding triglyceride concentrations and coagulation factors. In peri- or recently post-menopausal diabetic women with low risk for CVD, oral oestrogens can be used, since they exhibit stronger beneficial effects on glucose and lipid profiles. In any case, a progestogen with neutral effects on glucose metabolism should be used, such as natural progesterone, dydrogesterone or transdermal norethisterone. The goal is to maximise benefits and minimise adverse effects.

Venous thromboembolic events with estrogen therapy (ET) — route and formulation: Randomized controlled trials demonstrate that oral ET increases VTE risk in women ages 50 to 59, with risk declining after discontinuation; observational studies and meta-analyses suggest transdermal ET does not increase VTE risk, even in women with thrombophilia or obesity, and one observational study found oral CEE was associated with a 2-fold increase in VTE compared with oral estradiol.

### ACOG committee opinion no. 556: postmenopausal estrogen therapy: route of administration and risk of venous thromboembolism [^11416GWN]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2013). Low credibility.

The development of menopausal symptoms and related disorders, which lead women to seek prescriptions for postmenopausal estrogen therapy and hormone therapy, is a common reason for a patient to visit her gynecologist, but these therapies are associated with an increased risk of venous thromboembolism. The relative risk seems to be even greater if the treated population has preexisting risk factors for venous thromboembolism, such as obesity, immobilization, and fracture. Recent studies suggest that orally administered estrogen may exert a prothrombotic effect, whereas transdermally administered estrogen has little or no effect in elevating prothrombotic substances and may have beneficial effects on proinflammatory markers. When prescribing estrogen therapy, the gynecologist should take into consideration the possible thrombosis-sparing properties of transdermal forms of estrogen therapy. As part of the shared decision-making process, the gynecologist should weigh the risks against the benefits when prescribing combination estrogen plus progestin hormone therapy or estrogen therapy and counsel the patient accordingly.

### Comparative estrogen exposure from compounded transdermal estradiol creams and food and drug administration-approved transdermal estradiol gels and patches [^115PZ7Z4]. Menopause (2023). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

The primary goal of this study was to determine if increasing doses of compounded E2 cream corresponded to increasing urinary E2 concentrations, a proposed surrogate marker for estrogen exposure. Secondary goals were to compare E2 and other estrogen metabolite concentrations between formulations within the same dose range. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to explore these questions.

Although the expected, dose-dependent, increasing trend was observed with increasing doses of compounded E2 cream, the trend was not strictly increasing. This seems to suggest that the estrogen exposure from compounded creams in the mid dose range is not consistently higher than estrogen exposure from creams in the low dose range. There are multiple plausible hypotheses as to why this was observed; a lack of standardization in the compounding process across pharmacies and higher baseline E2 values in women using low dose compounded creams are two explanations that seem likely. The latter is an interesting hypothesis because, if menopausal symptoms are correlated with low endogenous E2 concentrations, it would be expected that women presenting with milder symptoms would have higher baseline E2 concentrations than women presenting with more severe symptoms. Women with milder symptoms might also be started on lower doses of ET. More work is warranted to further investigate this hypothesis.

Comparison of the E2 concentrations of compounded creams to E2 concentrations seen with similar doses of FDA-approved patches and gels showed that the actual values for compounded creams are lower in all three of the dose range categories. A statistically significant lower median E2 concentration was observed in all three dose range categories when comparing compounded E2 creams to transdermal E2 patches. The difference between compounded E2 cream and FDA-approved E2 gel was only significant in the mid dose range; however, the actual difference in medians in the other two dose range categories was similar to the actual difference observed in the mid dose range. In addition, the low number of gel observations (n = 11) in the low dose category likely limited the ability to detect a statistically significant difference. Comparison of median E1 and E3 concentrations generated results that are more nuanced than differences observed in E2. Intriguingly, the mid dose range category was the only category in which statistically significant differences in E1 and E3 were observed. Importantly, there was no statistically significant difference in BMI between the three different formulations. This suggests that the primary driver of changes in estrogen metabolite levels was related to the differing pharmacokinetic properties of the three different formulations.

### U.S. medical eligibility criteria for contraceptive use, 2024 [^116ecTTq]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2024). High credibility.

Combined hormonal contraceptives (CHCs) — obesity: For CHCs, a. BMI ≥ 30 kg/m² is category 2 and b. Menarche to < 18 years and BMI ≥ 30 kg/m² is category 2. Clarification notes that risk for thrombosis increases with multiple risk factors, and that when a person has multiple risk factors use of CHCs might increase thrombosis risk to an unacceptable level. Evidence states that COC use and higher BMI independently increase risk for VTE, with COC users with obesity having a relative risk for VTE of 5–8 times that of nonusers with obesity. Limited evidence suggests that effectiveness of certain COC formulations might decrease with increasing BMI; however, the observed reductions in effectiveness are minimal and evidence is conflicting, and effectiveness of the patch might be reduced in women with BMI ≥ 30 kg/m² or weight > 90 kg.

### Comparative estrogen exposure from compounded transdermal estradiol creams and food and drug administration-approved transdermal estradiol gels and patches [^117XrRJ4]. Menopause (2023). Medium credibility.

Given the 20 pg/mL downward shift in the postmenopausal serum E2 range with improved quantification methods, it could be safely assumed that the range necessary to prevent or delay bone loss may be shifted by the same amount. This would place the lower end of the range at 20 pg/mL, which is two times the upper limit of the postmenopausal range (< 10 pg/mL). In the present study, if we allow the interquartile range to serve as a rough estimate of the postmenopausal reference range, the surrogate upper limit of the postmenopausal E2 range is 0.48 ng/mg-Cr. Following the example of serum E2 concentrations, this would suggest that a concentration close to 0.96 ng/mg-Cr may sufficiently prevent or delay bone loss. When considering median E2 concentrations, our results suggest that compounded E2 creams at doses lower than 1 mg would fail to meet this threshold. Contrastingly, median E2 concentrations for the transdermal gel and patch formulations exceed that threshold in each dose range category, which is consistent with clinical outcomes seen in the literature. The relationship between E2 and BMD is complex, and uncoupling it from the known covariate, BMI, is necessary. In this study, the BMI of participants is lower than what would be seen in the general population, so the results are not generalizable. To properly explore research questions concerning E2 concentrations, BMD, and BMI, baseline and repeat measurements would be needed.

### Impact of body mass index on suppression of follicular development and ovulation using a transdermal patch containing 0.55-mg ethinyl estradiol / 2.1-mg gestodene: a multicenter, open-label, uncontrolled study over three treatment cycles [^113eF44J]. Contraception (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Body mass index (BMI) may influence ovulation inhibition resulting from transdermal hormone delivery. Investigation of this effect is important given the high prevalence of obesity in the US.

Study Design

This open-label, uncontrolled, Phase 2b trial stratified 173 women (18–35 years) according to three BMI groups (Group 1, n = 56, ≤ 30 kg/m²; Group 2, n = 55, > 30 kg/m² and ≤ 35 kg/m²; and Group 3, n = 47, > 35 kg/m²). Women used a contraceptive patch containing 0.55-mg ethinyl estradiol (EE) and 2.1-mg gestodene (GSD). The EE/GSD patch was used weekly for three 28-day cycles (one patch per week for 3 consecutive weeks followed by a 7-day, patch-free interval), and its effect on ovulation was assessed by the Hoogland score, a composite score that comprises transvaginal ultrasound and estradiol (E₂) and progesterone levels every 3 days in Cycles 2 and 3. Evaluation of pharmacokinetic parameters was a secondary aim of the study, and blood samples for analytic determination of EE, GSD and sex hormone-binding globulin were taken during the pretreatment cycle, Cycle 2 and Cycle 3. Compliance was assessed using diary information and serum drug levels.

Results

In the per-protocol set, there were only six ovulations during the study, and no participant ovulated in both study cycles. One ovulation occurred in Group 1, three in Group 2 and two in Group 3. Ovulation inhibition was unaffected by BMI; in all groups, most participants had Hoogland scores of 1 or 2 (i.e., follicle-like structures < 13 mm: Group 1, ≤ 30 kg/m², 80.0% in Cycle 2, 85.7% in Cycle 3; Group 2, > 30 kg/m² and ≤ 35 kg/m², 61.4% in Cycle 2, 75.0% in Cycle 3; Group 3, > 35 kg/m², 78.0% in Cycle 2, 72.5% in Cycle 3). Serum levels of follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, E2 and progesterone were similar between groups. Body weight had a limited effect on EE clearance that was unlikely to be clinically relevant.

Conclusion

The EE/GSD patch provided effective ovulation inhibition, even in women with higher BMI.

Implications

This is the largest-to-date study of physiologic endpoints and found no clinically important differences in ovarian suppression among obese and normal-weight users of the EE/GSD contraceptive patch, thus providing reassurance that obese women can achieve the same high level of contraceptive protection as normal-weight users.

### Hormonal contraception and obesity [^113bDNFz]. Fertility and Sterility (2016). Low credibility.

The rising rate of overweight and obesity is a public health crisis in the United States and increasingly around the globe. Rates of contraceptive use are similar among women of all weights, but because contraceptive development studies historically excluded women over 130% of ideal body weight, patients and providers have a gap in understanding of contraceptive efficacy for obese and overweight women. Because of a range of drug metabolism alterations in obesity, there is biologic plausibility for changes in hormonal contraception effectiveness in obese women. However, these pharmacokinetic changes are not linearly related to body mass index or weight, and it is unknown what degree of obesity begins to affect pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamics processes. Overall, most studies of higher quality do not demonstrate a difference in oral contraceptive pill effectiveness in obese compared with non-obese women. However, data are scant for women in the highest categories of obesity, and differences by progestin type are incompletely understood. Effectiveness of most non-oral contraceptives does not seem to be compromised in obesity. Exceptions to this include the combined hormonal patch and oral levonorgestrel emergency contraception, which may have lower rates of effectiveness in obese women. The purpose of this review is to summarize evidence on contraceptive use in women with obesity, including differences in steroid hormone metabolism, contraceptive effectiveness, and safety, compared with women of normal weight or body mass index using the same methods.

Other drugs

Contrary to the popular belief that therapy with sex hormones promotes weight gain, research has yielded conflicting results. In women, neither hormone replacement therapy after menopause (irrelevant if with estrogen/progesterone-based hormone replacement therapy or with phytoestrogens), nor hormonal contraception systematically lead to weight gain. On the contrary, suppression of sex hormone production in premenopausal women lowers the basal metabolic rate, suggesting even a weight-reducing effect of sex hormones. Recently, an association with increased energy intake has been found for patients treated with β-hydroxy β-methylglutaryl (HMG)-Co-A inhibitors (statins).

### Treatment of symptoms of the menopause: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^114AhonK]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2015). Medium credibility.

Endocrine Society menopause guideline — Systemic estrogen therapies list oral estrogen tablets and transdermal options with representative doses and key comments: Micronized E2 is available at 0.5, 1.0, 2.0 mg/d; estradiol valerate at 1.5 mg/d; and CEE at 0.3, 0.45, 0.625 mg/d, with notes that higher doses are available and that a preparation was used in WHI. Transdermal estradiol patch dosing ranges from 0.025 to 0.1 mg once or twice weekly depending on preparation, with an additional option at 0.014 mg/wk and a comment that diffusion can vary by patch. Estradiol percutaneous gel is dosed at 0.25–1.5 mg qd and corresponds to 0.5 to 2.0 mg estradiol tablets. An estradiol transdermal spray is listed at 1.5 mg qd, described as estradiol via spray, and transdermal products can be transferred to persons and pets by skin contact. A vaginal ring with estradiol acetate provides 0.05–0.10 mg/d, with systemic levels of estradiol providing relief of VMS and a 90-d duration/ring.

Contraception in women with overweight/obesity — In women with a BMI ≥ 27 kg/m² with comorbidities or BMI ≥ 30 kg/m² seeking contraception, we suggest oral contraceptives over injectable medications due to weight gain with injectables, provided that women are well-informed about the risks and benefits. Evidence syntheses report that only four trials included a placebo or no intervention group and no evidence has been found to support the association between combination hormonal contraception and weight change; by examining 79 trials of combination contraceptives, no substantial difference in weight could be found. For progestin-only contraceptives, mean gain was less than 2 kg for most studies up to 12 months. Selected studies have reported an increase in contraceptive failure in women with a BMI > 27 kg/m², and these data are conflicting and should be discussed individually.

### Hormonal contraceptives for contraception in overweight or obese women [^1156xxhZ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Obesity has reached epidemic proportions around the world. Effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives may be related to metabolic changes in obesity or to greater body mass or body fat. Hormonal contraceptives include oral contraceptives (OCs), injectables, implants, hormonal intrauterine contraception (IUC), the transdermal patch, and the vaginal ring. Given the prevalence of overweight and obesity, the public health impact of any effect on contraceptive efficacy could be substantial.

Objectives

To examine the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives in preventing pregnancy among women who are overweight or obese versus women with a lower body mass index (BMI) or weight.

Search Methods

Until 4 August 2016, we searched for studies in PubMed (MEDLINE), CENTRAL, POPLINE, Web of Science, ClinicalTrials.gov, and ICTRP. We examined reference lists of pertinent articles to identify other studies. For the initial review, we wrote to investigators to find additional published or unpublished studies.

Selection Criteria

All study designs were eligible. The study could have examined any type of hormonal contraceptive. Reports had to contain information on the specific contraceptive methods used. The primary outcome was pregnancy. Overweight or obese women must have been identified by an analysis cutoff for weight or BMI (kg/m(2)).

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently extracted the data. One entered the data into RevMan and a second verified accuracy. The main comparisons were between overweight or obese women and women of lower weight or BMI. We examined the quality of evidence using the Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale. Where available, we included life-table rates. We also used unadjusted pregnancy rates, relative risk (RR), or rate ratio when those were the only results provided. For dichotomous variables, we computed an odds ratio with 95% confidence interval (CI).

Main Results

With 8 studies added in this update, 17 met our inclusion criteria and had a total of 63,813 women. We focus here on 12 studies that provided high, moderate, or low quality evidence. Most did not show a higher pregnancy risk among overweight or obese women. Of five COC studies, two found BMI to be associated with pregnancy but in different directions. With an OC containing norethindrone acetate and ethinyl estradiol (EE), pregnancy risk was higher for overweight women, i.e. with BMI ≥ 25 versus those with BMI < 25 (reported relative risk 2.49, 95% CI 1.01 to 6.13). In contrast, a trial using an OC with levonorgestrel and EE reported a Pearl Index of 0 for obese women (BMI ≥ 30) versus 5.59 for nonobese women (BMI < 30). The same trial tested a transdermal patch containing levonorgestrel and EE. Within the patch group, obese women in the "treatment-compliant" subgroup had a higher reported Pearl Index than nonobese women (4.63 versus 2.15). Of five implant studies, two that examined the six-capsule levonorgestrel implant showed differences in pregnancy by weight. One study showed higher weight was associated with higher pregnancy rate in years 6 and 7 combined (reported P < 0.05). In the other, pregnancy rates differed in year 5 among the lower weight groups only (reported P < 0.01) and did not involve women weighing 70 kg or more. Analysis of data from other contraceptive methods indicated no association of pregnancy with overweight or obesity. These included depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (subcutaneous), levonorgestrel IUC, the two-rod levonorgestrel implant, and the etonogestrel implant.

Authors' Conclusions

The evidence generally did not indicate an association between higher BMI or weight and effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives. However, we found few studies for most contraceptive methods. Studies using BMI, rather than weight alone, can provide information about whether body composition is related to contraceptive effectiveness. The contraceptive methods examined here are among the most effective when used according to the recommended regimen. We considered the overall quality of evidence to be low for the objectives of this review. More recent reports provided evidence of varying quality, while the quality was generally low for older studies. For many trials the quality would be higher for their original purpose rather than the non-randomized comparisons here. Investigators should consider adjusting for potential confounding related to BMI or contraceptive effectiveness. Newer studies included a greater proportion of overweight or obese women, which helps in examining effectiveness and side effects of hormonal contraceptives within those groups.

### Hormonal contraceptives for contraception in overweight or obese women [^114hAH4A]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Obesity has reached epidemic proportions around the world. Effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives may be related to metabolic changes in obesity or greater body mass or body fat. Hormonal contraceptives mainly include oral contraceptives, injectables and implants, the transdermal patch, and the vaginal ring. We systematically reviewed the evidence on the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives among overweight and obese women.

Objectives

To examine the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives in preventing unplanned pregnancies among women who are overweight or obese versus women of lower weight or body mass index (BMI).

Search Methods

Through January 2013, we searched MEDLINE, CENTRAL, POPLINE, ClinicalTrials.gov, and ICTRP. The previous search also included EMBASE. We contacted investigators to identify other trials.

Selection Criteria

All study designs were eligible. Any type of hormonal contraceptive could have been examined. Reports had to contain information on the specific contraceptive method(s). The primary outcome was pregnancy. Overweight or obese women must have been identified by an analysis cutoff for weight or BMI (kg/m(2)).

Data Collection and Analysis

Data were abstracted by two authors. Life-table rates were included where available. For dichotomous variables, we computed an odds ratio with 95% confidence interval (CI). We used reported pregnancy rates or relative risk (RR) when those were the only results provided. The main comparisons were between overweight or obese women and women of lower weight or BMI. We assessed the quality of evidence for this review.

Main Results

We found nine reports with data from 13 trials that included a total of 49,712 women. Five reports from 2002 to 2012 compared BMI groups; of those, one reported a higher pregnancy risk for overweight or obese women. In that trial, women assigned to an oral contraceptive containing norethindrone acetate 1.0 mg plus EE 20 µg and having a BMI at least 25 had greater pregnancy risk compared to those with BMI less than 25 (reported RR 2.49; 95% CI 1.01 to 6.13). The comparisons reported in the other four studies were not significantly different for pregnancy. These included studies of a combined oral contraceptive (COC), a transdermal patch, an implant, and an injectable. The COC study showed no trend by BMI or weight. With the transdermal patch, body weight was associated with pregnancy (reported P < 0.001) but BMI was not. The implant study had one pregnancy and the injectable study reported no pregnancies. Four studies from the 1990s used weight alone rather than BMI. Results were mixed. Studies of a vaginal ring (never marketed) and a six-rod implant showed higher pregnancy rates for women weighing at least 70 kg versus those weighing less than 70 kg (reported P values: 0.0013 and < 0.05, respectively). However, two implant studies showed no trend by body weight.

Authors' Conclusions

The evidence did not generally show an association of BMI with effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives. However, the evidence was limited for any individual contraceptive method. Studies using BMI (rather than weight alone) can provide more information about whether body composition is related to contraceptive effectiveness. The efficacy of subdermal implants and injectable contraceptives may be unaffected by body mass. The contraceptive methods examined here are among the most effective when the recommended regimen is followed. The overall quality of evidence was low for this review. More recent reports provided moderate quality evidence, while the older studies provided evidence of low or very low quality for our purposes. Investigators should consider adjusting for potential confounding related to BMI. Trials should be designed to include sufficient numbers of overweight or obese women to adequately examine effectiveness and side effects of hormonal contraceptives within those groups.

### Treatment of symptoms of the menopause: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^1112e2de]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2015). Medium credibility.

Risks of menopausal hormone therapy — endometrial protection and risk modification — unopposed ET increases the risk of endometrial hyperplasia and cancer, whereas concurrent progestogen therapy for at least 12 days per month reduces this risk and is recommended for all women with a uterus. Continuous combined CEE and MPA was associated with a reduced risk of endometrial cancer over 13 years of cumulative follow-up. After 6 to 10 years, sequential regimens may be associated with a 2-fold increased risk of endometrial cancer, particularly in thin women. Micronized progesterone and dydrogesterone, in combination with estrogen, have been associated with an approximate 2-fold increase in endometrial cancer when continued beyond 5 years in a large observational study; in contrast, one RCT comparing micronized progesterone with MPA (3 y), a second RCT comparing micronized progesterone with chlormadinone acetate (18 mo), and a third trial of single-tablet formulation of cyclical estradiol-dydrogesterone (2 y) each demonstrated endometrial safety. Limited information is available about the safety of long cycle intermittent use of progestogens, but concern has been raised about increased risk of endometrial cancer. The levonorgestrel intrauterine device appears effective in minimizing hyperplasia and endometrial cancer risk, especially in obese women.

### Treatment of symptoms of the menopause: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^113mneJB]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2015). Medium credibility.

Venous thromboembolic events — For women at increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) who request menopausal hormone therapy (MHT), we recommend a nonoral route of ET at the lowest effective dose, if not contraindicated (1|⊕⊕○○); for women with a uterus, we recommend a progestogen (for example, progesterone and dydrogesterone) that is neutral on coagulation parameters. (1|⊕⊕⊕○). Obesity, age, and thrombophilia are associated with increased risk of VTE, and an approximately 2-fold increased risk of VTE (both deep vein thrombosis [DVT] and pulmonary embolism [PE]) with oral MHT is similar among women at low, intermediate, or high risk. A prior history of VTE confers the highest risk, and if the patient has a known inherited coagulation defect, such as Factor V Leiden, oral ET or EPT should be avoided because research has shown a high risk of VTE recurrence. A history of VTE due to pregnancy, oral contraceptives, unknown etiology, or blood clotting disorders poses a contraindication to any ET, whereas VTE due to past immobility, surgery, or bone fracture is a contraindication to oral but not necessarily transdermal MHT; in some countries, a history of any VTE is a contraindication to oral but not low-dose transdermal ET.

### Improving cardiovascular clinical competencies for the menopausal transition: a focus on cardiometabolic health in midlife [^115Mc8ar]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Intermediate risk

Intermediate-risk groups include those who have obesity, systemic lupus erytthematosus, hypertension, diabetes, active or prior tobacco use, dyslipidemia or an ASCVD risk score ≥ 5% to 7.4%. The use of MHT has not shown a direct impact on weight and studies have shown a greater risk of VTE, with a two-fold increase with oral MHT. For example, the WHI MHT trials illustrated a threefold increased risk of VTE in overweight (BMI > 25 kg/m²) postmenopausal women. The Heart and Estrogen/Progestin Replacement Study trial similarly showed an increase in CVD events among women with untreated dyslipidemia, although the even rates were similar at 4-year follow-up. Interestingly, the WHI trials showed no difference in cardiac events for women on MHT with dyslipidemia and treated with statins.

In clinical trials, oral but not transdermal MHT is associated with an increase in TG. Therefore, it is recommended to use transdermal preparations of MHT in women with dyslipidemia. Studies have shown no large clinical impact on blood pressure when MHT is initiated; however, MHT is relatively contraindicated in women with blood pressures ≥ 180/110 mm Hg given the increased risk of stroke. It is therefore recommended that blood pressure be controlled (ie, < 140/ < 90 mm Hg or < 130/80 mm Hg) with antihypertensive therapy prior to initiating MHT and transdermal formulations are preferred over oral. MHT may have beneficial effects on glycemic control and insulin resistance, but trials have not shown a reduction in incident CVD or CV events. Transdermal MHT is preferred for patients with metabolic syndrome and diabetes.

Other groups that should be considered in the intermediate-risk group are those with chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 1 and 2 without the presence of albuminuria, as the risk of CVD is higher in the presence of renal dysfunction. The 2023 AHA Scientific Statement for cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic (CKM) syndrome provides guidance on the interplay of cardiometabolic syndrome and the development of CVD and CKD. Stage 1 includes obesity and glucose intolerance whereas stage 2 includes cardiometabolic dysfunction and initial CKD.

### Menopause hormone therapy: 30 years of advances and controversies [^114ix3BR]. Endocrine Practice (2025). Medium credibility.

Menopause Hormone Therapy (MHT) recommendations have changed significantly over the last thirty years. Early observational studies suggested that MHT offered broad benefits for women, including relief from menopausal symptoms, improved genitourinary health, prevention of osteoporosis, and reduction in cardiovascular disease. As randomized controlled trials were conducted to validate these findings, new evidence emerged that led to shifts in guidance from medical societies and sharp declines in MHT prescriptions. This review summarizes three decades of studies, key advancements and ongoing controversies. We also discuss recommendations for MHT from cardiology, obstetrics/ gynecology and endocrinology perspectives.

### Cardiovascular risk in menopausal women and our evolving understanding of menopausal hormone therapy: risks, benefits, and current guidelines for use [^117TijsH]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

HTN is another well-established risk factor for CVD and the leading cause of CV mortality worldwide. Women with HTN have a higher population-adjusted CV mortality when compared with men and are less likely to be treated to guideline-directed blood pressure goals. Postmenopausal women are particularly susceptible to this – as estrogen levels decline, so do its protective vasodilatory effects and resulting benefits on blood pressure.

Obesity, another traditional CV risk factor, is more prevalent in women than in men. According to the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey in 2013, among the 37.7% of adults aged 20 years or older who were classified as obese, 35% were men and 40.4% were women. Obesity has independently shown to be associated with increased risk of CVD in women. The Framingham Heart Study, for example, found obesity to increase relative risk of CAD by 64% in women compared with 46% in men. Additionally, there is evidence to suggest inactivity levels are higher among women than in men, especially with older age. Given observational data that higher levels of activity may be associated with lower rates of chronic diseases such as CVD, this may also be adding to the increased CV risk that women face.

Use of the lowest clinically effective dose of postmenopausal hormone therapy conforms to current recommendations and good clinical practice. Although accumulating evidence demonstrates the efficacy and tolerability of low hormone therapy doses, data about their use are limited by a lack of long-term, randomized studies.

### Use of hormone replacement therapy and risk of venous thromboembolism: nested case-control studies using the QResearch and CPRD databases [^111KiiBs]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

A Cochrane review summarised evidence on the side effects of tibolone and showed no association with VTE; our results were in line with this finding. For increased VTE risk in raloxifene users, our observational study supported the results from a meta-analysis based on 189 exposed cases in randomised controlled trials (odds ratio 1.62, 95% confidence interval 1.25 to 2.09).

Meaning of the study: possible explanations and implications for clinicians and policy makers

This study has provided a more detailed picture of the VTE risks for different HRT preparations and can help clinicians and women make treatment choices. The study has shown that preparations based on conjugated equine oestrogen are associated with higher VTE risks than estradiol preparations, and this finding is consistent across age and body mass index categories. We did not expect to find an association between transdermal use and VTE risk because of the metabolic process, which has been confirmed in previous studies. However, our study showed that the vast majority of women using HRT continue to be prescribed oral preparations. When women with menopausal symptoms already have an increased VTE risk because of comorbidities or obesity, these women and their doctors should give greater consideration to transdermal HRT, in line with the NICE guideline.

Unanswered questions and future research

The HRT research recommendations from NICE raise concerns about VTE risk and about some cancers — in particular breast cancer — so a complementary detailed study of cancer risks is needed for a more complete picture. We are preparing such a study, based on the same data sources.

Conclusion

This large observational study, based on the UK general female population aged 40–79, provides information on VTE risk in women taking different types of HRT. The study shows that conjugated equine oestrogen based oral preparations, combined or oestrogen only, are associated with higher VTE risk than estradiol based preparations. Higher oestrogen dose is also associated with higher VTE risk. However, transdermal HRT or tibolone, used much less frequently, are not associated with any increased VTE risk. Therefore, the study provides more information for clinicians and women about relative VTE risks and highlights that oral HRT is still the preferred choice over other forms of treatment with no associated VTE risks.

### Nonsurgical management of urinary incontinence in women: a clinical practice guideline from the American College of Physicians [^117VNcEE]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2014). Medium credibility.

American College of Physicians (ACP) guideline — nonsurgical management of urinary incontinence (UI) in women — states that nonpharmacologic therapy with pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) should be the first-line treatment for women with UI. ACP recommends bladder training in women with urgency UI (Grade: weak recommendation, low-quality evidence). ACP recommends PFMT with bladder training in women with mixed UI (Grade: strong recommendation, high-quality evidence). ACP recommends against treatment with systemic pharmacologic therapy for stress UI (Grade: strong recommendation, low-quality evidence). ACP recommends pharmacologic treatment in women with urgency UI if bladder training was unsuccessful, and clinicians should base the choice of pharmacologic agents on tolerability, adverse effect profile, ease of use, and cost of medication (Grade: strong recommendation, high-quality evidence). ACP recommends weight loss and exercise for obese women with UI (Grade: strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). Supporting evidence notes that treatment of stress UI with standard pharmacologic therapies used for urgency UI has not been shown to be effective, while vaginal estrogen formulations improved continence and stress UI, but transdermal estrogen patches worsened UI; for urgency UI, oxybutynin, tolterodine, darifenacin, solifenacin, fesoterodine, and trospium increased continence rates and improved UI. Pharmacologic therapies were effective and equally efficacious at managing urgency UI and had a moderate magnitude of benefit in achieving continence rates; however, they were associated with adverse effects and evidence showed that some patients were likely to discontinue pharmacologic treatment because of these effects. Weight loss and exercise improved UI in obese women with no evident harms.

### Comparative estrogen exposure from compounded transdermal estradiol creams and food and drug administration-approved transdermal estradiol gels and patches [^116iyzSi]. Menopause (2023). Medium credibility.

Data source

Data analysis for this study used a subset of data from a larger study, Precision Analytical Retrospective Data Correlation (Clinical Trials ID, NCT04305093), which comprises deidentified, retrospective, observational clinical laboratory data collected from January 1, 2016, to December 31, 2019. The data that we were interested in for the present study were age at the time of sample collection, sex, menstrual status, body mass index (BMI) calculated from self-reported height and weight, hormonal medication use, and urinary estrogen metabolite concentrations including estrone, E2, estriol, 2-hydroxyestrone, 2-hydroxyestradiol, 4-hydroxyestrone, 16-hydroxyestrone, and 2-methoxyestrone. Data on race/ethnicity were not available. The study was approved by the National University of Natural Medicine Institutional Review Board. Because all data were deidentified, the institutional review board determined that written informed consent could be waived.

Women included in the on therapy groups had an age at the time of sample collection greater than or equal to 56 and were using a transdermal formulation of E2 (patch, gel, or cream). Only women who reported applying the transdermal therapy within a predefined window (within 1 wk for an E2 patch and within 3 d for an E2 cream or gel) were included. Women were excluded from these groups if they reported any of the following: kidney disease, an adrenal disorder, use of ET other than transdermal E2 (individuals were specifically asked about the use of birth control pills, combined estrogen treatments, and oral, sublingual, pelleted, or injectable estrogen), use of diindolylmethane, use of tamoxifen, use of anastrazole, or use of testosterone. Women were also excluded if there was missing data, evidence of overly dilute urine (urinary creatinine < 0.1 mg/mL), age older than 85 years, or a BMI outside the range of 16 to 60 kg/m².

Postmenopausal and premenopausal women on no therapy were included for reference. Inclusion criteria for women in the postmenopausal no-therapy group were an age at the time of sample collection of 56 years or older and no use of ET. Exclusion criteria were the same as those for the on therapy groups. Inclusion criteria for women in the premenopausal reference group were an age at collection older than 18 years, a reported menstrual status of "regular", and a reported sample collection during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. Exclusion criteria were again the same as those for previous groups.

### Efficacy of estradiol topical patch in the treatment of symptoms of depression following mini-gastric bypass in women [^115tqCEP]. Obesity Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Obesity is associated with elevated levels of estrogen. Gastric bypass causes rapid weight loss and decreased levels of estrogen. Patients after gastric bypass can suffer from anxiety and depression out of proportion to the surgical outcome. This study reports the efficacy of a short-term empiric trial of topical estradiol for the treatment of mild to moderate depression and anxiety following mini-gastric bypass (MGB) in women.

Methods

Postoperative MGB women were surveyed for the presence of depressive symptoms before and after MGB. The results of an empiric trial of transdermal patches of estradiol-17beta were assessed. Outcome measures were the self-reported efficacy of the patch.

Results

711 women who had undergone MGB and had functioning e-mail addresses made up the study. 62% of patients reported depression prior to surgery. 156 patients (22%) reported depression after the operation. 130 women were treated empirically with the patch, and remission of depression was observed in 92 (71%). In response to the question "Did the estrogen patch help?", subjects reported responses of 1) Yes, fantastic, 2) Yes, somewhat, 3) Hard to say, 4) No, in 36%, 31%, 20%, 13% of respondents respectively. Patients treated with estradiol sustained antidepressant benefit of treatment after the patch was discontinued. Treatment lasted < 1 month, 1–3 months, and > 3 months, in 48%, 32% and 20% respectively. Treatment was well-tolerated and adverse events were rare.

Conclusion

Depression is common in obese patients and remains a problem in a subset following the MGB operation. Transdermal estradiol replacement appears to be an effective treatment of symptoms of depression in women following MGB.

### Type and timing of menopausal hormone therapy and breast cancer risk: individual participant meta-analysis of the worldwide epidemiological evidence [^116VF9mX]. Lancet (2019). Excellent credibility.

There was extensive information in the prospective studies on the effects of starting MHT use at various ages throughout the range 40–59 years. For women who had started anywhere in this age range the RRs among current users were similar, and were all highly significant. Comparatively few women, however, had started such treatment well after the menopause, for example at ages 60–69 years. Among them, the excess risk was statistically definite for oestrogen-progestagen but not for oestrogen-only preparations, although this non-significant result should not be considered in isolation from the highly significant excess risks in the younger age groups.

Further evidence about the effects of starting the use of such treatments well after the menopause is provided by the randomised trials (appendix pp 29, 30), in which the main aim was to assess the effects of such treatments on vascular disease, which is uncommon before age 60 years. Much the largest were the two Women's Health Initiative (WHI) trials, one of oestrogen-only, the other of oestrogen-progestagen hormonal treatment. Both prespecified heart disease as the primary outcome, bone fracture as the main secondary outcome, and breast cancer as the main potential adverse outcome; their original power calculations considered the ability to detect a 15–22% increase in breast cancer.

In the oestrogen-only trials the average age at randomisation was 64 years and the mean between-group difference in the duration of hormone treatment during the scheduled intervention phase but before breast cancer onset was about 3·9 years, after allowing for non-compliance (appendix p 29). During or after the intervention phase a total of 434 women developed breast cancer (including 384 in the WHI trial, of whom 327 [85%] were overweight or obese). The aggregated results suggested an unexpected decrease in risk (RR 0·77, 99% CI 0·60–0·99, Z = –2·7, p = 0·01), possibly because starting oestrogen-only therapy well after the menopause does not have the same effect on breast cancer risk as starting at around the time of the menopause. Another possibility, given the epidemiological evidence that oestrogenic stimulation can increase risk and the strong randomised evidence that anti-oestrogen drugs can reduce risk in postmenopausal women, is that the apparently protective effect of hormone treatment in the oestrogen-only trials arose mainly by the play of chance, perhaps augmented by changes in breast density, somewhat reducing the sensitivity of mammographic screening.

### The 2022 hormone therapy position statement of the North American Menopause Society [^111h2BZX]. Menopause (2022). High credibility.

Routes of administration for vasomotor symptoms (VMS) — For treating VMS, systemic estrogens can be prescribed as oral drugs; transdermal patches, sprays, and gels; or as vaginal rings, and meta-analysis found no evidence of a significant difference between transdermal EPT and oral EPT for alleviating VMS. Transdermal estradiol and oral CEE are similarly effective in alleviating VMS, but clinical trials directly comparing risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, breast cancer, and venous thromboembolism (VTE) by estrogen routes and doses are lacking; nonoral routes may offer potential advantages because they bypass first-pass hepatic effect, yet it is unknown whether nonoral routes of ET or EPT are associated with lower risk versus oral routes for VTE, breast cancer, and cardiovascular outcomes because clinical trials have not been designed to examine those outcomes.

Clinical caveats during treatment with menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) outline management of persistent vasomotor symptoms (VMS), bleeding, breast tenderness, hypertriglyceridemia, and hypothyroidism as follows: For persistent, intolerable VMS or hot flashes that persist after adjustment, switch mode of administration or adjust dose of estrogen and/or progestogen, consider another etiology of flashes, and ensure absorption with serum estradiol determination if transdermal; for bleeding, a sequential regimen may be more appropriate for recently menopausal (< 2 y), persistent irregular bleeding (> 6 mo) should be evaluated for endometrial pathology with earlier evaluation if obese, diabetic, or with a family history of endometrial cancer, and atrophic endometrium more remote from menopause may respond to increased estrogen dose; for breast tenderness, reduce estrogen dose or change progestogen preparation, note that CEE/BZA may improve symptoms, changing to tibolone may be helpful in women who develop mastalgia on conventional MHT, review family history and contributing factors, and Transdermal ET is preferred; for baseline TG level > 200 mg/dL, if oral estrogen is selected, monitor serum TG levels 2 wk after starting therapy; for hypothyroid on thyroid replacement, monitor TSH 6 to 12 wk after starting oral MHT and T4 dose may need to be increased.

Venous thromboembolism (VTE) risk evidence base and limitations — There are "no large, prospective randomized studies comparing the risk of VTE among various doses of estrogen, types of progestin, or routes of administration", and "Only level II-2 studies exist, including large cohort and case-control studies that are limited by a number of methodological issues which may skew results". Methodological concerns include that "Without randomization, it is difficult to control for different patient populations and prescriber bias" and that VTE risk "is greater in new hormonal contraceptive users during the first year, in older women, and in obese women", with some studies not adequately accounting for these imbalances. Additional limitations are that "the diagnosis of venous thrombosis may not always be accurate" and that because "the incidence of VTE is low, large numbers of observations are required to compare cases among various treatment groups".

5.4 Ovarian health

Postmenopausal women with obesity have an increased risk of ovarian cancer.

Preventive steps for ovarian health include healthcare providers taking a detailed medical and family history for breast, ovarian, and glandular cancers, being vigilant for constitutional signs of ovarian cancer, and appropriate referral to a gynecologic oncologist.

5.5 Contraception

The risk of VTE was two times higher in the obesity group among users of combined hormonal contraception compared with women of normal weight. There were also associations between this group and the risk of arterial thrombosis and embolism.

Compared with other progestin‐only contraception, depot‐medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) has been associated with loss of bone mineral density with long‐term use. However, the degree to which bone mineral density is affected in mature women aged 65 years or older with obesity is unclear. One pilot study demonstrated that there were no significant differences in the degree of lumbar spine bone mineral density loss across BMI categories.

An individualized approach to contraceptive advice is recommended as there may be other obesity‐related medical conditions and medications that should be taken into consideration. Contraceptive options for women with obesity are shown in Table 3.

TABLE 3
Contraceptive options for women with obesity, with or without a history of bariatric surgery a

Emergency contraception

Insufficient data exist on the ideal method of emergency contraception for women of reproductive age with obesity.

The dose of levonorgestrel‐based emergency contraception can be doubled as this may improve its effectiveness in women with obesity.

5.6 Menopause

Postmenopausal women with obesity may experience symptoms of menopause, irrespective of additional circulating estrogens derived from adipose tissue. Obesity and smoking are risk factors for worsening vasomotor symptoms in women aged 65 years or older.

Treatment of symptoms associated with menopause can include lifestyle changes such as wearing cool, light clothing, oral hydration, and reducing caffeinated beverages and tobacco use. Alternatives to hormonal therapies such as clonidine, paroxetine, venlafaxine, gabapentin, and black cohosh can be used at low doses to treat vasomotor symptoms.

Hormone replacement therapy for women with obesity is controversial due to the risks of breast cancer, VTE, and cardiovascular disease in this population.

### Type and timing of menopausal hormone therapy and breast cancer risk: individual participant meta-analysis of the worldwide epidemiological evidence [^113hUXE6]. Lancet (2019). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

Users of systemic hormone therapy who started around the time of menopause were at greater risk of invasive breast cancer than apparently similar never users. Excess risks were greater among current than past users, but some risk persisted for more than a decade after MHT use ceased. There was little excess risk after use of MHT for less than 1 year, but there were definite excess risks associated with just 1–4 years of use, and progressively greater risks with longer use. For a given duration of use, the excess risk among current users of MHT was greater for ER+ than for ER– disease. The risk was greater for oestrogen-progestagen than for oestrogen-only preparations, particularly if progestagen use was daily rather than intermittent. Risks did not differ substantially between the main oestrogenic constituents, or by whether oestrogens were administered orally or transdermally. There appeared to be little risk, however, from topical vaginal oestrogen preparations, which limit systemic exposure. For the oestrogen-progestagen preparations, risks did not generally differ between different progestagenic constituents, including micronised [natural] progesterone, but appeared to be somewhat lower for combinations containing dydrogesterone.

Ovarian function ceases with menopause; thereafter, oestrogen levels fall substantially and progesterone levels fall to near zero. Endogenous oestrogen synthesis in post-menopausal women occurs mainly in adipose tissue, catalysed by the enzyme aromatase. Postmenopausal oestrogen levels therefore correlate strongly with the amount of adipose tissue, and hence with BMI, and can be reduced to nearly zero by treatment with aromatase inhibitors.

Among postmenopausal women in western countries, ER+ breast cancer accounts for about three-quarters of all breast cancer cases and deaths, and postmenopausal oestrogenic activity is a strong determinant of the incidence of ER+ breast cancer. Among postmenopausal women, the incidence of ER+ breast cancer correlates with age at menopauseand with blood oestrogen levels, and randomised trials have shown that the incidence of ER+ breast cancer can be greatly reduced by anti-oestrogen drugs such as an aromatase inhibitor, or tamoxifen. In these trials (appendix p 28), allocation to the anti-oestrogen treatment halved the incidence of ER+ breast cancer in postmenopausal women during the scheduled treatment period (RR 0·51, 99% CI 0·39–0·65, Z = –6·9, p < 10 −10). Hence, among postmenopausal women oestrogen-only MHT might be expected to increase ER+ breast cancer incidence rates, as is indicated by the prospective studies.

### The 2022 hormone therapy position statement of the North American Menopause Society [^111P6Njs]. Menopause (2022). High credibility.

North American Menopause Society (NAMS) 2022 position statement — key points on breast cancer risk and counseling for hormone therapy: The risk of breast cancer related to hormone therapy is low, with estimates indicating a rare occurrence (less than one additional case per 1,000 women per year of hormone therapy use or three additional cases per 1,000 women when used for 5 years with CEE plus MPA) (Level I). Women should be counseled about the risk of breast cancer with hormone therapy, putting the data into perspective, with risk similar to that of modifiable risk factors such as two daily alcoholic beverages, obesity, and low physical activity (Level III). Different hormone therapy regimens may be associated with increased breast density, which may obscure mammographic interpretation, leading to more mammograms or more breast biopsies and a potential delay in breast cancer diagnosis (Level II), and the effect of hormone therapy on breast cancer risk may depend on the type of hormone therapy, duration of use, regimen, prior exposure, and individual characteristics (Level II).

Added value of this study

In an individual participant meta-analysis of all eligible prospective studies, conclusions can now be based on over 100 000 postmenopausal women who developed breast cancer. Half of these women had used MHT, most starting around the time of the menopause at ages 40–59 years. Prospective studies avoid the potential biases in retrospective studies, and the large number of cases limits the play of chance. All types of MHT, except vaginal oestrogens, were associated with increased risks of developing breast cancer. The risks were greater for oestrogen-progestagen than for oestrogen-only preparations, particularly if the progestagen was given daily rather than intermittently. The associations with MHT were much stronger for oestrogen-receptor-positive tumours than for oestrogen-receptor-negative tumours. Among current users, there were definite excess risks even during 1–4 years (mean: 3 years) of MHT use, and progressively greater risks with longer use. During 5–14 years of MHT use, the relative risks (RRs) were similarly increased if MHT use had started at ages 40–44, 45–49, 50–54, and 55–59 years; RRs appeared to be attenuated if MHT use had started after age 60 years. They were also attenuated by adiposity, particularly for oestrogen-only MHT (which had little effect in obese women). After MHT use ceased, some excess risk of breast cancer persisted for more than a decade, which was greater with longer durations of prior MHT use. There was little risk following less than 1 year of use.

### Assessing benefits and harms of hormone replacement therapy: clinical applications [^113U5vbf]. JAMA (2002). Excellent credibility.

An estimated one third of postmenopausal women in the United States use hormone replacement therapy (HRT) to treat symptoms of menopause and prevent chronic conditions. In the context of this widespread use, evidence has been growing about the potential harms of HRT, particularly regarding long-term use. Physicians and patients are often confused about how to use results of studies in individual cases. This article applies the current state of evidence for the benefits and harms of HRT to management decisions in 4 clinical situations. Patient preferences, as well as evidence, are important for these decisions. Benefits and harms need to be readdressed periodically to apply newly published evidence and to reassess emerging risks, comorbidities, and needs of individuals.

The other important finding in the polyoestradiol study was, as predicted, a protective effect of oestrogen on bone health: 18 serious skeletal events were reported in the group undergoing combined androgen deprivation versus none in the polyoestradiol group (p = 0·001). Osteoporosis and associated events are important and costly side-effects of LHRHa. Strategies to mitigate LHRHa-induced bone loss include use of bisphosphonates, targeting of RANKL (with, for example, denosumab), and use of selective oestrogen-receptor modulators. All these approaches, however, are expensive, but would potentially be unwarranted if an effective method of achieving androgen deprivation without associated bone loss were available. The extended PATCH trial will investigate the effects of LHRHa and oestrogen patches on bone health by assessment of fractures and bone-mineral density.

Our findings that fasting total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and fasting glucose concentrations in serum increased in patients receiving LHRHa are in keeping with previous reports. During the first year of treatment with LHRHa, increases of total cholesterol concentrations by 5–10% and of HDL cholesterol by 6–12% have been reported in several small studies. Observed increases in fasting glucose concentrations by 1–2% have also been seen in short-term (12-week) studies, and larger changes have been seen in one longer-term study. These results are again consistent with our findings (increases of 2% and 6% in fasting glucose concentrations at 6 and 12 months, respectively). The metabolic abnormalities associated with use of LHRHa have similarities to those in the metabolic syndrome: increases in obesity and concentrations of total and LDL cholesterol and triglycerides, and decreases in lean mass and insulin sensitivity. The effects with LHRHa, however, also include increases in HDL cholesterol concentrations and subcutaneous fat, but no effect on blood pressure is seen. The changes we noted in lipid profiles in the oestrogen-patches group are in keeping with the known beneficial arterial effects of oral and parenteral oestrogen therapy, and the decrease in glucose concentrations is consistent with the beneficial effects of oestradiol on pancreatic β-cell function. A limitation of our analysis, however, is that data on triglycerides and LDL cholesterol were not collected. Changes in concomitant medication that might affect lipid profiles were also not recorded, but, as this was a randomised study, it is likely that these effects would have been balanced across the arms. As the trial was not powered to compare changes in metabolic factors, results should be confirmed in future trials.

### Role of estrogen in the regulation of central and peripheral energy homeostasis: from a menopausal perspective [^116ZBU6c]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Leptin regulates peripheral metabolic processes of glucose and lipids that are typically relevant to the pancreas, liver, skeletal muscle, ATs, immune cells, and cardiovascular system. It was reported that obese postmenopausal women have worse insulin resistance and elevated leptin level. Based on human data, Norata et al.also suggested that the leptin/adiponectin ratio is a stronger predictor of cardiovascular diseases than single adipokine. The prospective, longitudinal study of Di Carlo et al. evaluated 44 healthy postmenopausal women who randomly received either transdermal E2 plus nomegestrol or no treatment. As demonstrated by the results, serum leptin as well as the total and percent fat mass is significantly increased 1 year after the study in untreated women, while transdermal E2 treatment shows no changes in leptin as well as body mass throughout the study. Chu et al. compared oral and transdermal E2 treatment of obese postmenopausal women with metabolic syndrome (MBS). The transdermal E2 group shows a similar result as the aforementioned study, whereas the oral E2-treated women have an increased leptin level, resulting in an increased leptin/adiponectin ratio with impaired insulin resistance. This once again indicates that different routes of E2 administration should be selected according to each woman's individual condition of each woman.

### Inequalities in hormone replacement therapy prescribing in UK primary care: population based cohort study [^111spxfQ]. BMJ Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Symptoms of the menopause usually last several years and can affect sleep and quality of life, with symptoms ranging from tolerable to markedly disruptive. Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is known to be effective at treating problematic vasomotor symptoms of menopause. Over the years, HRT prescribing rates have varied, with rates droppingafter the Women's Health Initiative publication in 2002 reporting adverse health outcomes, but more recently, HRT prescribing has increased hugely. The UK's National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) published its first ever guidance on managing the menopause in 2015, recommending an individualised approach to treatment and with tables to help explain risks. The NICE menopause guidance was updated in 2024and included a discussion aid on HRT and the likelihood of some medical conditions to support doctors.

The Study of Women's Health Across the Nation (SWAN) in the US followed up > 3000 women from 1995, and reported that in black women, menopause occurred eight months earlier than in white women. The study also found a higher burden and length of symptoms, including vasomotor symptoms (hot flashes and night sweats), clinically significant depressive symptoms, and lower quality of life in black than in white women. Recently, data from the US have reported that women from black ethnic groups reported greater symptom severity than white women, even after adjusting for socioeconomic status, and African American women had a longer length of symptoms (> 10 years) than other ethnic groups. The evidence therefore suggests that HRT might be clinically indicated in a higher proportion of black women in the US.

Although these findings cannot be generalised to other countries, differences by ethnic group likely persist. Other factors reported to be associated with increasing severity of symptoms of menopause include obesity, being a current smoker, having diabetes, and living in a more deprived neighbourhood. We know that smoking rates, obesity, and the prevalence of type 2 diabetesare highest in more socioeconomically deprived areas, suggesting that we would expect the severity of symptoms of menopause and clinical need for HRT to be highest in areas with high poverty rates. Furthermore, social and economic inequalities are fundamental causes of ethnic inequalities in health.

### Management of menopause: a view towards prevention [^116moZ1N]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2022). High credibility.

Women spend approximately one-third of their lives with menopause, which occurs around 50 years of age. It is now appreciated that several important metabolic and cardiovascular disease risks emerge during the menopausal transition. Many important conditions occur 10–15 years after menopause, including weight gain and obesity, metabolic syndrome, diabetes, osteoporosis, arthritis, cardiovascular disease, dementia, and cancer; therefore, the occurrence of menopause heralds an important opportunity to institute preventative strategies. These strategies will lead to improved quality of life and decreased mortality. Various strategies are presented for treating symptoms of menopause and diseases that are asymptomatic. Among several strategies is the use of hormone therapy, which has efficacy for symptoms and osteoporosis, and can improve metabolic and cardiovascular health. When instituted early, which is key, in younger postmenopausal women (under 60 years) oestrogen has been found to consistently decrease mortality with a favourable risk-benefit profile in low-risk women. Prospective data show that long-term therapy might not be required for this benefit.

### A decade after the women's health initiative – the experts do agree [^112z5taw]. Fertility and Sterility (2012). Medium credibility.

Conclusion — indication for hormone therapy — states that leading medical societies devoted to the care of menopausal women agree that the decision to initiate hormone therapy should be for the indication of treatment of menopause-related symptoms, and although research is ongoing and these recommendations may be modified over time, there is no question that hormone therapy has an important role in managing symptoms for women during the menopausal transition and in early menopause.

### Safety and efficacy of contraceptive methods for obese and overweight women [^113RtobR]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Increasing rates of obesity have become a major public health challenge. Given the added health risks that obese women have during pregnancy, preventing unwanted pregnancy is imperative. Clinicians who provide contraception must understand the efficacy, risks, and the weight changes associated with various contraceptive methods. Despite differences in the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of hormonal contraceptives in overweight and obese women, efficacy does not appear to be severely impacted. Both estrogen-containing contraceptives and obesity increase the risk of venous thromboembolism, but the absolute risk remains acceptably low in reproductive age women.

### The 2022 hormone therapy position statement of the North American Menopause Society [^1178jTBx]. Menopause (2022). High credibility.

Weight and body composition — during the menopause transition, body fat increases and lean body mass decreases, with an average weight gain of 1.5 lb per year; by about 2 years after the final menstrual period, weight changes flatten. Estrogen-progestogen therapy has no effect on weight or is associated with less weight gain versus nonuse, and in the WHI women randomized to CEE with or without MPA had no statistically significant difference in slowing of weight gain and a lesser increase in waist circumference over the first 3 years of use compared with those randomized to placebo; increasing physical activity was independently associated with less weight gain over time. Key points note that hormone therapy significantly reduces the diagnosis of new-onset type 2 DM but it is not government approved for this indication (Level I), that hormone therapy has no effect on body weight and composition in women without diabetes or with weight concerns when used for menopause symptom management (Level II), and that although hormone therapy may help attenuate abdominal adipose accumulation and weight gain associated with the menopause transition, the effect is small (Level II).

### Type and timing of menopausal hormone therapy and breast cancer risk: individual participant meta-analysis of the worldwide epidemiological evidence [^113gYZXi]. Lancet (2019). Excellent credibility.

Implications of all the available evidence

If the associations are largely causal, MHT use in western countries has already caused about 1 million breast cancers, out of a total of about 20 million since 1990. For women of average weight in western countries, 5 years use of oestrogen plus daily progestagen MHT, starting at age 50 years, would increase 20-year breast cancer risks at ages 50–69 years from 6·3% to 8·3%, an absolute increase of 2·0 per 100 women (one in every 50 users). Similarly, 5 years use of oestrogen plus intermittent progestagen MHT would increase the 20-year risk from 6·3% to 7·7%, an absolute increase of 1·4 per 100 women (one in 70 users). Finally, 5 years use of oestrogen-only MHT would increase the 20-year risk from 6·3% to 6·8%, an absolute increase of 0·5 per 100 women (one in 200 users); this excess would be greater in lean women, but in obese women oestrogen-only MHT is associated with little excess risk. For 10 years of use, the 20-year increases in incidence would be about twice as great as for 5 years of use.

Most individual studies were too small to assess reliably the long-term breast cancer risk associated with just a few years of MHT use. Furthermore, some epidemiological evidence remains unpublished, and studies completed before the 2000s necessarily had limited information about long-term effects of past use. Reliable assessment of the association between breast cancer risk and current and past use of MHT requires review of the totality of the worldwide evidence, with careful control of potential sources of appreciable bias and confounding. Reviews of published data cannot provide this.

The Collaborative Group on Hormonal Factors in Breast Cancer has therefore sought to bring together for central analysis published and unpublished individual participant data from eligible epidemiological studies with information on the type and timing of MHT use. Bringing these studies together has yielded extremely large numbers of cases of breast cancer among women who started MHT in their 40s or 50s.

Although relatively few women in the prospective studies had started MHT in their 60s, most women in the randomised trials of these same preparations were older than 60 years when recruited, as these trials were designed primarily to evaluate possible protective effects against vascular disease (which is less common at younger ages). These and other relevant randomised trials are reviewed separately here.

### Hormone replacement therapy and thrombotic risk: beauty is only skin deep [^111hZ8Sp]. Nature Clinical Practice: Cardiovascular Medicine (2008). Medium credibility.

In their meta-analysis of studies on hormone replacement therapy (HRT), Canonico and colleagues reported that the risk of venous thrombosis was increased by 2.5-fold in current users of oral preparations, while the risk was not increased in those using transdermal hormone patches. Several large trials have shown that oral estrogens do not protect against, and might even increase the risk of, coronary heart disease, and slightly elevates the risk of breast cancer after prolonged use. On the basis of these results, HRT is no longer indicated for long-term use. Canonico et al.'s meta-analysis shows that when used over a short period of time to alleviate the symptoms of menopause, skin patches are likely to be safer than orally-administered hormones with respect to the risk of venous thrombosis, which is a potentially fatal complication.

### Hormone replacement therapy and risk of venous thromboembolism in postmenopausal women: systematic review and meta-analysis [^116jmHkf]. BMJ (2008). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To assess the risk of venous thromboembolism in women using hormone replacement therapy by study design, characteristics of the therapy and venous thromboembolism, and clinical background.

Design

Systematic review and meta-analysis.

Data Sources

Medline.

Studies Reviewed

Eight observational studies and nine randomised controlled trials.

Inclusion Criteria

Studies on hormone replacement therapy that reported venous thromboembolism. REVIEW MEASURES: Homogeneity between studies was analysed using chi(2) and I(2) statistics. Overall risk of venous thromboembolism was assessed from a fixed effects or random effects model.

Results

Meta-analysis of observational studies showed that oral oestrogen but not transdermal oestrogen increased the risk of venous thromboembolism. Compared with non-users of oestrogen, the odds ratio of first time venous thromboembolism in current users of oral oestrogen was 2.5 (95% confidence interval 1.9 to 3.4) and in current users of transdermal oestrogen was 1.2 (0.9 to 1.7). Past users of oral oestrogen had a similar risk of venous thromboembolism to never users. The risk of venous thromboembolism in women using oral oestrogen was higher in the first year of treatment (4.0, 2.9 to 5.7) compared with treatment for more than one year (2.1, 1.3 to 3.8; P < 0.05). No noticeable difference in the risk of venous thromboembolism was observed between unopposed oral oestrogen (2.2, 1.6 to 3.0) and opposed oral oestrogen (2.6, 2.0 to 3.2). Results from nine randomised controlled trials confirmed the increased risk of venous thromboembolism among women using oral oestrogen (2.1, 1.4 to 3.1). The combination of oral oestrogen and thrombogenic mutations or obesity further enhanced the risk of venous thromboembolism, whereas transdermal oestrogen did not seem to confer additional risk in women at high risk of venous thromboembolism.

Conclusion

Oral oestrogen increases the risk of venous thromboembolism, especially during the first year of treatment. Transdermal oestrogen may be safer with respect to thrombotic risk. More data are required to investigate differences in risk across the wide variety of hormone regimens, especially the different types of progestogens.

### American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and American college of endocrinology position statement on menopause-2017 update [^1178U8Q1]. Endocrine Practice (2017). Low credibility.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY This American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE)/American College of Endocrinology (ACE) Position Statement is designed to update the previous menopause clinical practice guidelines published in 2011 but does not replace them. The current document reviews new clinical trials published since then as well as new information regarding possible risks and benefits of therapies available for the treatment of menopausal symptoms. AACE reinforces the recommendations made in its previous guidelines and provides additional recommendations on the basis of new data. A summary regarding this position statement is listed below: New information available from randomized clinical trials and epidemiologic studies reported after 2011 was critically reviewed. No previous recommendations from the 2011 menopause clinical practice guidelines have been reversed or changed. Newer information enhances AACE's guidance for the use of hormone therapy in different subsets of women. Newer information helps to support the use of various types of estrogens, selective estrogen-receptor modulators (SERMs), and progesterone, as well as the route of delivery. Newer information supports the previous recommendation against the use of bioidentical hormones. The use of nonhormonal therapies for the symptomatic relief of menopausal symptoms is supported. Newer information enhances AACE's guidance for the use of hormone therapy in different subsets of women. Newer information helps to support the use of various types of estrogens, SERMs, and progesterone, as well as the route of delivery. Newer information supports the previous recommendation against the use of bioidentical hormones. The use of nonhormonal therapies for the symptomatic relief of menopausal symptoms is supported. New recommendations in this position statement include: 1.

Recommendation

the use of menopausal hormone therapy in symptomatic postmenopausal women should be based on consideration of all risk factors for cardiovascular disease, age, and time from menopause. 2.

Recommendation

the use of transdermal as compared with oral estrogen preparations may be considered less likely to produce thrombotic risk and perhaps the risk of stroke and coronary artery disease. 3.

Recommendation

when the use of progesterone is necessary, micronized progesterone is considered the safer alternative. 4.

Recommendation

in symptomatic menopausal women who are at significant risk from the use of hormone replacement therapy, the use of selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors and possibly other nonhormonal agents may offer significant symptom relief. 5.

Recommendation

AACE does not recommend use of bioidentical hormone therapy. 6.

Recommendation

AACE fully supports the recommendations of the Comité de l'Évolution des Pratiques en Oncologie regarding the management of menopause in women with breast cancer. 7.

Recommendation

HRT is not recommended for the prevention of diabetes. 8.

Recommendation

### Cardiovascular risk in menopausal women and our evolving understanding of menopausal hormone therapy: risks, benefits, and current guidelines for use [^111Bw5aY]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Despite recent improvements in sex and gender research in cardiovascular disease (CVD), disparities still exist. Ischemic heart disease (IHD) in particular remains a leading cause of death in women. The reasons for this are multifactorial and include biological, social, environmental, and economic factors. While men and women share many traditional risk factors for CVD, these alone do not explain the sex-specific increased risk of CVD in women. Additional female-specific risk factors, most notably menopause, contribute significantly. Menopause has been associated with an increased CVD risk in women aged ⩾55 years. The transition to menopause has shown to be associated with negative alterations in the lipid profile, increased susceptibility to weight gain and metabolic syndrome, and both epicardial and paracardial fat deposition. – It represents a vulnerable time for women and an opportunity for consideration of menopause hormone therapy (MHT).

In prior decades, MHT was thought to be effective in primary and secondary prevention of CVD. However, large trials demonstrating the risks of MHT have changed clinician and public perception of these strategies. As our understanding of MHT has evolved, so has our knowledge regarding the appropriate timing and patient characteristics for safe administration. Given the efficacy of MHT in reducing the unpleasant vasomotor and genitourinary symptoms associated with menopause, which can severely alter quality of life, understanding the safety and potential cardiovascular (CV) risks and benefits of MHT is important in optimizing the health of our female patients.

### Current perspectives on benefits and risks of hormone replacement therapy [^1123uSfv]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2001). Low credibility.

Hormone replacement therapy with estrogen alone or with added progestin relieves menopausal symptoms and physical changes associated with depleted endogenous estrogen levels. Estrogen replacement has also demonstrated a clear benefit in the prevention of osteoporosis. Hormone replacement therapy with added progestin maintains spinal bone density, protects against postmenopausal hip fractures, and provides these benefits even when therapy is started after age 60. More recently, additional benefits have emerged. Current estrogen and hormone replacement therapy users have a 34% reduction in the risk of colorectal cancer and a 20% to 60% reduction in the risk of Alzheimer's disease. Until recently, the body of evidence indicated that hormone replacement therapy with estrogen only reduced cardiovascular disease risk by 40% to 50% in healthy patients; whether the findings of 3 ongoing trials will change this conclusion is pending availability of the final results. The many benefits of estrogen and hormone replacement therapy must be weighed against a slight increase in the risk of breast cancer diagnosis with use for 5 or more years, but which disappears following cessation of therapy. Overall, estrogen and hormone replacement therapy improves the quality of life and increases life expectancy for most menopausal women.

### Obesity and risk of venous thromboembolism among postmenopausal women: differential impact of hormone therapy by route of estrogen administration. the ESTHER study [^112n1oEU]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Oral estrogen use and elevated body mass index (BMI) increase the risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE). Recent data suggest that transdermal estrogen might be safe with respect to thrombotic risk. However, the impact of transdermal estrogen on the association between overweight (25 kg m(-2) < BMI ≤ 30 kg m(-2)) or obesity (BMI > 30 kg m(-2)) and VTE risk has not been investigated.

Methods

We carried a multicenter case-control study of VTE among postmenopausal women aged 45–70 years, between 1999 and 2005, in France. Case population consisted of women with a first documented idiopathic VTE. We recruited 191 hospital cases matched with 416 hospital controls and 62 outpatient cases matched with 181 community controls.

Results

The odds ratio (OR) for VTE was 2.5 [95% confidence interval (CI):1.7–3.7] for overweight and 3.9 (95% CI: 2.2–6.9) for obesity. Oral, not transdermal, estrogen was associated with an increased VTE risk (OR = 4.5; 95% CI: 2.6–7.7 and OR = 1.1; 95% CI: 0.7–1.7, respectively). Compared with non-users with normal weight, the combination of oral estrogen use and overweight or obesity further enhanced VTE risk (OR = 10.2; 95% CI: 3.5–30.2 and OR = 20.6; 95% CI: 4.8–88.1, respectively). However, transdermal users with increased BMI had similar risk as non-users with increased BMI (OR = 2.9; 95% CI: 1.5–5.8 and OR = 2.7; 95% CI: 1.7–4.5 respectively for overweight; OR = 5.4; 95% CI: 2.1–14.1 and OR = 4.0; 95% CI: 2.1–7.8 respectively for obesity).

Conclusions

In contrast to oral estrogen, transdermal estrogen does not confer an additional risk of idiopathic VTE in women with increased BMI. The safety of transdermal estrogen on thrombotic risk has to be confirmed.

### Treatment of symptoms of the menopause: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^114UWJ1K]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2015). Medium credibility.

Duration of menopausal hormone therapy — We suggest that the decision to continue MHT be revisited at least annually, targeting the shortest total duration of MHT consistent with the treatment goals and evolving risk assessment of the individual woman. Technical remarks note that current proposed limits on duration are informed by large intervention trials (5 to 7 y) with extended follow-up for 13 years, that risk rates for breast cancer and CVD increase with age and time since menopause with risks appearing less with ET than with EPT, and that ovarian cancer risk may also increase relative to duration of MHT. The guideline concludes that clinicians and patients should reassess MHT continuation yearly and discuss the risks and individual benefits beyond 5 years.

### Obesity and poor breast cancer prognosis: an illusion because of hormone replacement therapy? [^1114bs1i]. British Journal of Cancer (2009). Low credibility.

Obesity has repeatedly been associated with breast tumours of larger size, lymph node positivity, and poor prognosis, although some studies have produced contrasting findings. However, many studies lack information on the use of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and mammography examinations before diagnosis. Use of HRT interacts, or rather competes, with obesity on breast cancer risk among postmenopausal women, probably by sharing hormonal carcinogenic pathways. The HRT effect on risk is most pronounced in lean postmenopausal women, in whom the endogenous production of oestrogen is the lowest. Obese women might benefit more from mammographic screening than normal weight women because of larger breasts, more difficult to palpate, and a lower mammographic breast density, and thereby a higher sensitivity of the mammography. Therefore, not taking HRT use and mammographic screening pattern into consideration could create spurious relationships between prognosis and obesity. Obesity is linked to an increased all-cause mortality, which means that using all-cause mortality as the outcome might obscure the association between obesity and breast cancer death. We therefore studied the influence of obesity on tumour characteristics and cause-specific mortality in postmenopausal breast cancer patients, taking into account HRT use before diagnosis and mode of detection.

### Lipid management in patients with endocrine disorders: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^114FRTbh]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). High credibility.

Menopause and hormonal replacement — In postmenopausal women, we recommend treating dyslipidemia with statin therapy, rather than hormone therapy; hormone therapy increases the risk of cardiovascular disease, specifically venous thromboembolism and stroke, however, the absolute risk of cardiovascular disease is lower in younger compared to older postmenopausal women, and hormone therapy is described as estrogen ± progesterone/a progestin; in postmenopausal women on hormone therapy and when risk factors for cardiovascular disease, we recommend statin therapy to reduce cardiovascular risk; menopause may be associated with an increase in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and a decrease in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol; risk factors may be traditional risk factors or risk-enhancing factors; in women who enter menopause early (< 40 to 45 years old), we recommend assessment and treatment of lipids and other cardiovascular risk factors; early menopause enhances cardiovascular disease risk and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk should be calculated and followed after menopause.

### Are all estrogens created equal? A review of oral vs. transdermal therapy [^113Z2fWy]. Journal of Women's Health (2012). Low credibility.

Background

To compare oral and transdermal delivery systems in domains of lipid effects; cardiovascular, inflammatory, and thrombotic effects; effect on insulin-like growth factor, insulin resistance, and metabolic syndrome; sexual effects; metabolic effects including weight; and effects on target organs bone, breast, and uterus.

Methods

Review of the literature 1990–2010. Studies selected on basis of applicability, quality of data, and relationship to topic.

Results

Data applicable to the comparisons of oral versus transdermal delivery systems for postmenopausal estrogen therapy were utilized to perform a review and formulate conclusions.

Conclusions

Significant differences appear to exist between oral and transdermal estrogens in terms of hormonal bioavailability and metabolism, with implications for clinical efficacy, potential side effects, and risk profile of different hormone therapy options, but neither results nor study designs are uniform. Bypassing hepatic metabolism appears to result in more stable serum estradiol levels without supraphysiologic concentrations in the liver. By avoiding first-pass metabolism, transdermal hormone therapy may have less pronounced effects on hepatic protein synthesis, such as inflammatory markers, markers of coagulation and fibrinolysis, and steroid binding proteins, while oral hormone therapy has more pronounced hyper-coagulant effects and increases synthesis of C-reactive protein and fibrinolytic markers. Both oral and transdermal delivery systems have beneficial effects on high-density lipoprotein cholesterol to low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratios (oral > transdermal), while the transdermal system has more favorable effects on triglycerides. Incidence of metabolic syndrome and weight gain appears to be slightly lower with a transdermal delivery system. Oral estrogen's significant increase in hepatic sex hormone binding globulin production lowers testosterone availability compared with transdermal delivery, with clinically relevant effects on sexual vigor.

### Thoughts on individualizing hormone replacement therapy based on the postmenopausal health disparities study data [^115VQ8Vs]. Journal of Women's Health (2003). Low credibility.

Background

This study presents an approach that can be used to address the controversy about the long-term risks and benefits of hormone replacement therapy (HRT).

Methods

Categories of estradiol (E(2)) levels based on the mean and standard deviation (SD) in postmenopausal women not treated with HRT were created. E(2) levels achieved in women treated with oral or patch replacement therapy were examined. In the application of this method, data from the Postmenopausal Health Disparities Study were used because identical E(2) assay methods were used for all postmenopausal women in the study population.

Results

The findings demonstrated that approximately 42% of HRT-treated women had E(2) levels less than the mean E(2) level plus 1 SD in the controls (37 pg/ml). In contrast, approximately 11% had E(2) levels greater than the mean E(2) level plus 6 SD in the controls (126 pg/ml). Menopausal vasomotor and vaginal symptoms decreased (p < 0.06) in increasing control-based E(2) categories. Levels of both follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) were significantly correlated with the E(2) control-based categories (both p = 0.000). When hormone variables and other variables (e.g., moderate alcoholic beverage consumption and bilateral ovariectomy) known to be determinants of E(2) levels in postmenopausal women not treated with HRT were included in the model for oral or patch HRT-treated women, 51.1% of the variability in the control-based E(2) categories was explained when menopause duration, use of oral as opposed to patch therapy, body mass index (BMI), scores for medical compliance, and being white entered the equation as statistically significant predictors.

Conclusions

First, there is substantial variability in E(2) concentrations achieved with conventional oral and patch HRT. Second, various factors that are statistically significant predictors of response categories have been identified. Third, race/ethnic group plays a role in the response to HRT. Finally, the demonstration of variable responses to HRT and the application of the categorization paradigm presented will be useful in resolving the controversy about the risks and benefits of conventional HRT.

### Breast cancer risk in relation to the interval between menopause and starting hormone therapy [^112tu3A5]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2011). Low credibility.

The substantial heterogeneity in hormonal therapy–associated risks of breast cancer that we found, with independent effects of the type of hormonal therapy used, the interval between menopause and starting hormonal therapy, and the duration of hormonal therapy use could well account for much of the apparent variation in hormonal therapy–associated risks across studies. The populations that have been studied vary in terms of the prevalence of obesity and the interval between menopause and starting hormonal therapy. For example, in the Women's Health Initiative randomized trials, some 80% of participants were overweight or obese and approximately 90% were randomly assigned to hormonal therapy 5 years or more after their menopause. Among users of estrogen-only hormonal therapy, we found little or no increase in the risk of breast cancer among overweight or obese women who started hormonal therapy 5 years or more after menopause (RR = 0.91, 95% CI = 0.73 to 1.14), consistent with findings from the Women's Health Initiative trial (RR = 0.77, 95% CI = 0.59 to 1.01). The corresponding value for users of estrogen–progestin hormonal therapy in our data (RR = 1.39, 95% CI = 1.18 to 1.64) was also consistent with findings from the Women's Health Initiative trial (RR = 1.26, 95% CI = 1.00 to 1.59). Moreover, breast cancer incidence rates in the estrogen–progestin randomized trial were similar to those observed here (0.46% per year in this study for use beginning 5 years or more after menopause and 0.43% per year in the randomized trial vs 0.3% per year in nonusers of hormone therapy both in this study and in the trial). However, breast cancer incidence rates in this study were highest among current users of estrogen–progestogen who began use less than 5 years after menopause (0.61% per year), and no comparable randomized data are available because the large majority of women were randomly assigned to estrogen–progestin more than 5 years after their menopause. Hence, the findings from randomized trials of hormonal therapy with respect to breast cancer risk may not apply to women who start using hormonal therapy at around the time of their menopause.

### USPSTF: No HRT after menopause for chronic conditions… [^114JMJKB]. AAFP (2022). Medium credibility.

Nov. 10, 2022, 4: 14 p. m. News Staff — The U. S. Preventive Services Task Force is advising family physicians and other health care professionals to avoid administering hormone replacement therapy to patients for the primary prevention of chronic conditions after menopause. The task force's final recommendation statement, issued Nov. 1 and accompanied by a final evidence review and evidence summary, recommended against the use of combined estrogen and progestin to prevent chronic conditions in postmenopausal people and against the use of estrogen alone to prevent chronic conditions in postmenopausal people who have had a hysterectomy. Both recommendations received "D" grades, meaning that the task force concluded with moderate certainty that these treatments had no net benefit. Overall, the recommendation statement is consistent with the task force's 2017 recommendation on the topic.

"For people who have already gone through menopause, using hormone therapy is not an effective way to prevent chronic conditions because the potential harms cancel out any potential benefit, " said Carol Mangione, M. D. M. S. P. H., the task force's chair, in a USPSTF Bulletin. "Fortunately, the task force has many other evidence-based recommendations on ways people can stay healthy as they age". The recommendation statement does not apply to people who are considering HRT to manage perimenopausal symptoms such as vaginal dryness or hot flashes. It also does not apply to people who have had primary ovarian insufficiency or surgical menopause. Story Highlights "Importantly, this recommendation is.

The task force, after reviewing the available evidence, found that while taking HRT to prevent chronic conditions may result in some modest benefits such as reduced risk of fractures and diabetes, it may also lead to increased risk of severe harms such as stroke or thromboembolic events such as deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, especially among women older than 60. For individuals who should not receive HRT, the USPSTF pointed to a number of recommendations it has issued related to preventing cardiovascular disease and other chronic conditions in adults. These include the use of aspirin to prevent CVD, screening for hypertension, screening for prediabetes and type 2 diabetes, behavioral counseling to promote a healthy lifestyle to prevent CVD in adults, and screening for osteoporosis to prevent fractures.

The task force also recommended that patients and health care professionals work together to determine the best way to maintain good health throughout one's lifespan.
