## Question

An Hfr strain of E. coli contains:

Answer Choices:
A. a vector of yeast or bacterial origin which is used to make many copies of a particular DNA sequence
B. a bacterial chromosome with a human gene inserted
C. a bacterial chromosome with the F factor inserted
D. a human chromosome with a transposable element inserted

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what an Hfr strain of E. coli contains. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the definition of Hfr and its molecular basis. Then, I should verify how Hfr differs from F+ and F− strains. Next, I will examine each answer choice against that definition. Finally, I will select the best option and double-check for any pitfalls in wording or common misconceptions.

> Let me first confirm the definition. Hfr stands for "high frequency of recombination", and it arises when the F factor (a conjugative plasmid) integrates into the E. coli chromosome, thereby allowing the bacterial chromosome to be transferred at high frequency during conjugation. This integration converts a typical F+ strain into an Hfr strain, so the defining feature is a bacterial chromosome that now carries the F factor sequences integrated into its DNA.

> Wait, let me verify the alternatives so I don't jump to conclusions. Option A describes a cloning vector (like a yeast artificial chromosome or bacterial artificial chromosome), which is a tool for propagating DNA fragments rather than a natural bacterial strain configuration; that does not match Hfr biology, so I should rule this out. Option B mentions a human gene inserted into the bacterial chromosome; that would be a recombinant strain created by genetic engineering, not the classical Hfr state, so this is also incorrect. Option D talks about a human chromosome with a transposable element, which is entirely outside the realm of E. coli genetics, so that is clearly wrong. Option C aligns with the integrated-F-factor definition of Hfr, which fits the molecular mechanism and textbook descriptions.

> Hold on, I should verify the nuance about the F factor itself. The F factor is a plasmid in F+ cells, but in Hfr cells it is no longer a free plasmid; it has recombined into the chromosome, so the correct phrasing is that the bacterial chromosome contains the F factor inserted, not that the strain "contains a plasmid" in the usual sense. This distinction matters because some distractors might try to trick you with plasmid language, but Hfr specifically means integration into the chromosome.

> I will now examine the answer choices again to ensure no subtle wording undermines the correct choice. Option C is the only one that accurately reflects the Hfr state: the bacterial chromosome has the F factor integrated, enabling high-frequency chromosomal transfer during conjugation. The other options either describe cloning vectors, heterologous gene insertions, or human chromosomes, none of which define Hfr.

> Final answer: C. a bacterial chromosome with the F factor inserted.

---

The correct answer is **C. a bacterial chromosome with the F factor inserted**. Hfr (high frequency of recombination) strains arise when the F plasmid integrates into the E. coli chromosome, enabling conjugative transfer of chromosomal DNA at high frequency. Options A, B, and D are incorrect because they describe cloning vectors, human genes, or human chromosomes, which are not features of Hfr strains.

---

## Definition and characteristics of Hfr strains

Hfr strains are **E. coli strains in which the F plasmid has integrated into the bacterial chromosome** [^notfound]. This integration confers high-frequency recombination during conjugation, allowing efficient transfer of chromosomal genes from donor to recipient cells. Key characteristics include:

- **F plasmid integration**: The F plasmid integrates into the E. coli chromosome, forming a single, continuous DNA molecule.

- **High-frequency recombination**: During conjugation, Hfr strains transfer chromosomal DNA at high frequency, facilitating genetic recombination.

- **Directional gene transfer**: Gene transfer occurs in a specific direction, starting from the integrated F plasmid and proceeding along the chromosome.

---

## Molecular mechanism of Hfr formation

The formation of Hfr strains involves **integration of the F plasmid into the E. coli chromosome** through homologous recombination. This process typically occurs at specific insertion sequences (IS elements) present in both the F plasmid and the bacterial chromosome. The integrated F plasmid retains its ability to initiate conjugation, but instead of transferring only itself, it now transfers chromosomal DNA adjacent to the integration site.

---

## Role of the F plasmid in Hfr strains

The F plasmid is a conjugative plasmid that encodes genes necessary for conjugation, including pilus formation and DNA transfer. In Hfr strains, the integrated F plasmid initiates conjugation and directs the transfer of chromosomal DNA. The F plasmid remains integrated during this process, and only a portion of the chromosome is typically transferred, depending on the duration of conjugation.

---

## Consequences of Hfr formation

The integration of the F plasmid into the E. coli chromosome has **significant consequences**:

- **High-frequency recombination**: Hfr strains exhibit increased rates of genetic recombination, facilitating the exchange of genetic material between bacteria.

- **Gene mapping**: Hfr strains have been instrumental in mapping the E. coli chromosome, as the order of gene transfer during conjugation reflects their relative positions on the chromosome.

- **Genetic diversity**: Hfr strains contribute to genetic diversity within bacterial populations, promoting adaptation and evolution.

## Analysis of answer choices

| **Option** | **Description** | **Correctness** |
|-|-|-|
| A | A vector of yeast or bacterial origin used to make many copies of a particular DNA sequence | Incorrect. This describes cloning vectors (e.g. plasmids, BACs, YACs), not Hfr strains. |
| B | A bacterial chromosome with a human gene inserted | Incorrect. This describes recombinant DNA technology, not Hfr strains. |
| C | A bacterial chromosome with the F factor inserted | Correct. This accurately describes Hfr strains, where the F plasmid is integrated into the bacterial chromosome. |
| D | A human chromosome with a transposable element inserted | Incorrect. This describes human genetics, not bacterial Hfr strains. |

---

## Conclusion

Hfr strains are **E. coli strains in which the F plasmid has integrated into the bacterial chromosome**, enabling high-frequency recombination during conjugation. This integration facilitates the transfer of chromosomal genes and has been instrumental in genetic research, particularly in mapping the E. coli chromosome. The correct answer is **C. a bacterial chromosome with the F factor inserted**.

Chromosomes as hypergraphs

To gain a better understanding of genome structure with multi-way contacts, we constructed hypergraphs for entire chromosomes at 1 Mb resolution. We show an incidence matrix of Chromosome 22 as an example in Fig. 3 a, and in Fig. 3 b, we visualize the distribution of 1 Mb contacts at multiple orders (2-way contacts, 3-way contacts, etc.) on Chromosomes 22. Figure 3 c highlights the most common intra-chromosomal multi-way contacts on Chromosome 22 using multi-way contact "motifs", which we use as a simplified way to show hyperedges. Figure 3 d shows how multi-way contacts at lower resolutions (25 Mb, 1 Mb) are composed of many multi-way contacts at higher resolutions (100 kb, read level), and Fig. 3 e visualizes the multi-way contacts contained in Fig. 3 d as a hypergraph.

We also identified multi-way contacts that contain loci from multiple chromosomes. These inter-chromosomal multi-way contacts can be seen at 1 Mb resolution in Fig. 3 f and in 25 Mb resolution for both adult fibroblasts and B lymphocytes in Fig. 4. Figure 4 gives a summary of the entire genome's multi-way contacts, by showing the most common intra- and inter-chromosomal multi-way contacts across all chromosomes. We highlight examples of multi-way contacts with loci that are contained within a single chromosome ("intra only"), spread across unique chromosomes ("inter only"), and a mix of both within and between chromosomes ("intra and inter"). We note that many of the "inter only" contacts observed in Fig. 4 may also have intra-chromosomal contacts when viewed at a higher resolution, similar to Fig. 3 d. Finally, we found the most common inter-chromosomal multi-way contacts across all chromosomes, which we summarize with five example chromosomes in Fig. 5 using multi-way contact motifs. These multi-way contacts between distant genomic loci may offer insights into the higher-order structural patterning of the genome and its relationship with transcriptional regulation.

### The DNA sequence and biological annotation of human chromosome 1 [^115ZPx2g]. Nature (2006). Excellent credibility.

The reference sequence for each human chromosome provides the framework for understanding genome function, variation and evolution. Here we report the finished sequence and biological annotation of human chromosome 1. Chromosome 1 is gene-dense, with 3,141 genes and 991 pseudogenes, and many coding sequences overlap. Rearrangements and mutations of chromosome 1 are prevalent in cancer and many other diseases. Patterns of sequence variation reveal signals of recent selection in specific genes that may contribute to human fitness, and also in regions where no function is evident. Fine-scale recombination occurs in hotspots of varying intensity along the sequence, and is enriched near genes. These and other studies of human biology and disease encoded within chromosome 1 are made possible with the highly accurate annotated sequence, as part of the completed set of chromosome sequences that comprise the reference human genome.

The recent accomplishment of a truly complete human genome has afforded a new view of chromosome structure and function that was limited 30 years ago. Here, we discuss the expansion of knowledge from the early cytological studies of the genome to the current high-resolution genomic, epigenetic and functional maps that have been achieved by recent technology and computational advances. These studies have revealed unexpected complexities of genome organization and function and uncovered new views of fundamental chromosomal elements. Comprehensive genomic maps will enable accurate diagnosis of human diseases caused by altered chromosome structure and function, facilitate development of chromosome-based therapies and shape the future of preventative medicine and healthcare.

### A first-generation linkage disequilibrium map of human chromosome 22 [^112cbPX5]. Nature (2002). Excellent credibility.

DNA sequence variants in specific genes or regions of the human genome are responsible for a variety of phenotypes such as disease risk or variable drug response. These variants can be investigated directly, or through their non-random associations with neighbouring markers (called linkage disequilibrium (LD)). Here we report measurement of LD along the complete sequence of human chromosome 22. Duplicate genotyping and analysis of 1,504 markers in Centre d'Etude du Polymorphisme Humain (CEPH) reference families at a median spacing of 15 kilobases (kb) reveals a highly variable pattern of LD along the chromosome, in which extensive regions of nearly complete LD up to 804 kb in length are interspersed with regions of little or no detectable LD. The LD patterns are replicated in a panel of unrelated UK Caucasians. There is a strong correlation between high LD and low recombination frequency in the extant genetic map, suggesting that historical and contemporary recombination rates are similar. This study demonstrates the feasibility of developing genome-wide maps of LD.

### Concerning the eXclusion in human genomics: the choice of sex chromosome representation in the human genome drastically affects the number of identified variants [^1149tiL3]. G3 (2023). Medium credibility.

The typical human genome contains a diploid count of 46 chromosomes (2 n = 46), but reference genome-based analyses require a haploid representation of each chromosome for correct inference (e.g. n = 23). In humans, the reference genome complement includes haploid representations for each autosome (n = 22) but not the sex chromosomes X and Y (n = 2); thus, the human reference genome contains an n = 24 chromosome representation (Fig. 1b). The X and Y deviate from autosomal expectations in that (1) not all individuals possess a Y chromosome, making the mapping of all reads to the Y chromosome erroneous in XX (or X0 for example) samples and (2) the X and Y retain regions of high-sequence similarity (maintaining between 98 and 100% sequence identity) due to their shared ancestry. Thus, particular regions on the X and Y chromosomes violate the assumption that reference genome representation for linear alignments be uniformly haploid.

Main

Since the announcement of the sequencing of the human genome 20 years ago, human chromosomes have remained unfinished owing to large regions of highly identical repeats clustered within centromeres, regions of segmental duplication, and the acrocentric short arms of chromosomes. The presence of large swaths (more than 100 kb) of highly identical repeats that are themselves copy number polymorphic has meant that such regions have persisted as gaps, which limits our understanding of human genetic variation and evolution. The advent of long-read sequencing technologies and the use of DNA from complete hydatidiform moles, however, have now made it possible to assemble these regions from native DNA for the first time –. Here we present the first, to our knowledge, complete linear assembly of human chromosome 8. We chose to assemble chromosome 8 because it carries a modestly sized centromere (approximately 1.5–2.2 Mb), in which AT-rich, 171-base-pair (bp) α-satellite repeats are organized into a well-defined higher-order repeat (HOR) array. The chromosome, however, also contains one of the most structurally dynamic regions in the human genome — the β-defensin gene cluster at 8p23.1 (refs. –) — as well as a recurrent polymorphic neocentromere at 8q21.2, which have been largely unresolved for the past 20 years.

Following the rediscovery of Mendel's work in 1900, the field of genetics advanced rapidly. Human genetics, however, lagged behind; this was especially noticeable in cytogenetics, which was already a mature discipline in experimental forms in the 1950s. We did not know the correct human chromosome number in 1955, let alone were we able to detect a chromosomal abnormality. In 1956 a discovery was reported that markedly altered human cytogenetics and genetics. The following is an analysis of that discovery.

Chromosomal evolution

We next investigated whether we could gain new insights into chromosome evolution among vertebrates. Given the more than 430 million years (Myr) of evolutionary divergence among the species sampled here, it was difficult to generate whole genome-to-genome alignments across all species. Thus, we focused our initial analyses on 1,147 highly conserved BUSCO vertebrate genes that are shared among our assemblies of all 16 species and the human reference (GRCh38). Human chromosomes mapped with greater orthology to 3.7 ± 1.3 (s.d.) chromosomes on average in other mammals, compared to 5.6 ± 2.2 in amphibians and 9.6 ± 3.3 in teleost fishes (Fig. 5a, Supplementary Table 22). The skate chromosome arrangement was more conserved with tetrapods, mapping to 2.9 ± 1.4 chromosomes on average, compared to 4.8 ± 2.5 in teleost fishes. These findings indicate that, along with a reduction in GC content, the teleost lineage has experienced more massive chromosome rearrangements since divergence from their most recent common ancestor with tetrapods, consistent with a proposed higher rearrangement rate in teleosts.

### The structure, function and evolution of a complete human chromosome 8 [^113Xhew5]. Nature (2021). Excellent credibility.

The complete assembly of each human chromosome is essential for understanding human biology and evolution. Here we use complementary long-read sequencing technologies to complete the linear assembly of human chromosome 8. Our assembly resolves the sequence of five previously long-standing gaps, including a 2.08-Mb centromeric α-satellite array, a 644-kb copy number polymorphism in the β-defensin gene cluster that is important for disease risk, and an 863-kb variable number tandem repeat at chromosome 8q21.2 that can function as a neocentromere. We show that the centromeric α-satellite array is generally methylated except for a 73-kb hypomethylated region of diverse higher-order α-satellites enriched with CENP-A nucleosomes, consistent with the location of the kinetochore. In addition, we confirm the overall organization and methylation pattern of the centromere in a diploid human genome. Using a dual long-read sequencing approach, we complete high-quality draft assemblies of the orthologous centromere from chromosome 8 in chimpanzee, orangutan and macaque to reconstruct its evolutionary history. Comparative and phylogenetic analyses show that the higher-order α-satellite structure evolved in the great ape ancestor with a layered symmetry, in which more ancient higher-order repeats locate peripherally to monomeric α-satellites. We estimate that the mutation rate of centromeric satellite DNA is accelerated by more than 2.2-fold compared to the unique portions of the genome, and this acceleration extends into the flanking sequence.

Methodologies change with time. That is just the evolution of science. It is what makes us get up and go to work with enthusiasm about what we do. Historically, the science of cytogenetics evolved from not knowing the number of chromosomes in human cells to, following a laboratory mistake, the determination of the accurate number of chromosomes in human cells to be 46. This was followed by the ability to generate a karyotype based on size and centromere position that we can appreciate in Figure 4A–C. Subsequently, in the 1970s, Q‐banding was established and was followed by our current banding techniques: G‐banding (Figure 4D) and R‐banding. Then came FISH with its ability to detect targeted copy number and structural rearrangements at a much higher resolution, and then CMA to investigate copy number aberrations genome‐wide. As shown in Figure 4A–H, the methodologies of science evolve. That is just the nature of our work. And that is a good thing. A clinical genetics laboratory plays a critical role beyond simply diagnosing individuals with genetic diseases; it must have a big toolbox supported by a diverse menu of validated tests. This includes testing for a wide range of indications, such as solid and hematologic malignancies, pediatric neurodevelopmental disorders including autism, and adult‐onset genetic conditions. To handle these varied clinical scenarios, the clinical laboratory must have different methodologies tailored to the specific diagnostic context. Therefore, we must seriously think about algorithmic testing, that is, there is an optimal test for the right patient, at the right time, at the right cost. That is what drives the evolution of clinical laboratories in this field. The science of cytogenetics has evolved through time and will continue to do so with emerging technologies.

### The finished DNA sequence of human chromosome 12 [^112hV3YP]. Nature (2006). Excellent credibility.

Human chromosome 12 contains more than 1,400 coding genes and 487 loci that have been directly implicated in human disease. The q arm of chromosome 12 contains one of the largest blocks of linkage disequilibrium found in the human genome. Here we present the finished sequence of human chromosome 12, which has been finished to high quality and spans approximately 132 megabases, representing approximately 4.5% of the human genome. Alignment of the human chromosome 12 sequence across vertebrates reveals the origin of individual segments in chicken, and a unique history of rearrangement through rodent and primate lineages. The rate of base substitutions in recent evolutionary history shows an overall slowing in hominids compared with primates and rodents.

### Origins of human genetics. A personal perspective [^115UkXCT]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2021). Medium credibility.

Early advances

The transition from general genetics to human genetics is characterized by recognizing the medical aspects. Newly discovered chromosome abnormalities, hereditary metabolic defects and molecular technology resulted in defining new human diseases due to different genetic causes. Human genetics includes medical genetics, devoted to all of its medical aspects and clinical genetics, the practice of diagnosis and management of genetic disorders. McKusick in 1993 stated that clinical genetics originated in 1959 when human cytogenetics and biochemical genetics developed into mainstream subjects of research and its medical applications. The term genomics, derived from genome (coined by Winkler in 1920), was introduced in 1987. It relates not only to all genes, but also to the molecules regulating their functions and nuclear structures.

The European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) was founded at the Third International Congress of Human Genetics in 1966 in Chicago, with the author of this review and Albert de la Chapelle present. Its first annual meeting was held 1968 in Paris.

Chromosomes

Human genetics is a theory-driven science, but it also greatly depends on advances in methods of investigation. Probably the most important single contribution to the development of modern human genetics was that of cytogenetics in 1959. At first, individual chromosomes in mitosis could not yet be individually identified distinguished except for a few chromosome pairs (Extended Text #3 in Supp. Mat.). New cell culture methods and improved mitotic chromosomal preparations for light microscopic analysis directly led to the recognition in 1959/60 that several human disorders result from defined aberrations in the number or structure of chromosomes (Trisomies 21, 18, 13; partial chromosomal deletions or duplications). Since each aberration was associated with a distinct phenotype, a relationship between a genotype and a phenotype could be defined. In 1959, individuals without a Y chromosome were shown to be female, whereas those with a Y chromosome were male no matter how many X chromosomes were present. This was the first step towards defining the fundaments of mammalian sex determination. In the 1960s and 1970s it became apparent that fetal death is frequently caused by chromosomal aberrations that are not observed in newborns. Although chromosomes in metaphase were described as early as 1879, the correct number of human chromosomes was not established until 1956 (Extended Text #4 in Supp. Mat.).

### The DNA sequence, annotation and analysis of human chromosome 3 [^1171EcfL]. Nature (2006). Excellent credibility.

After the completion of a draft human genome sequence, the International Human Genome Sequencing Consortium has proceeded to finish and annotate each of the 24 chromosomes comprising the human genome. Here we describe the sequencing and analysis of human chromosome 3, one of the largest human chromosomes. Chromosome 3 comprises just four contigs, one of which currently represents the longest unbroken stretch of finished DNA sequence known so far. The chromosome is remarkable in having the lowest rate of segmental duplication in the genome. It also includes a chemokine receptor gene cluster as well as numerous loci involved in multiple human cancers such as the gene encoding FHIT, which contains the most common constitutive fragile site in the genome, FRA3B. Using genomic sequence from chimpanzee and rhesus macaque, we were able to characterize the breakpoints defining a large pericentric inversion that occurred some time after the split of Homininae from Ponginae, and propose an evolutionary history of the inversion.

### Telomere-to-telomere assembly of a complete human X chromosome [^114Bdwxx]. Nature (2020). Excellent credibility.

After two decades of improvements, the current human reference genome (GRCh38) is the most accurate and complete vertebrate genome ever produced. However, no single chromosome has been finished end to end, and hundreds of unresolved gaps persist 1,2. Here we present a human genome assembly that surpasses the continuity of GRCh38 2, along with a gapless, telomere-to-telomere assembly of a human chromosome. This was enabled by high-coverage, ultra-long-read nanopore sequencing of the complete hydatidiform mole CHM13 genome, combined with complementary technologies for quality improvement and validation. Focusing our efforts on the human X chromosome 3, we reconstructed the centromeric satellite DNA array (approximately 3.1 Mb) and closed the 29 remaining gaps in the current reference, including new sequences from the human pseudoautosomal regions and from cancer-testis ampliconic gene families (CT-X and GAGE). These sequences will be integrated into future human reference genome releases. In addition, the complete chromosome X, combined with the ultra-long nanopore data, allowed us to map methylation patterns across complex tandem repeats and satellite arrays. Our results demonstrate that finishing the entire human genome is now within reach, and the data presented here will facilitate ongoing efforts to complete the other human chromosomes.

### Deep learning modeling mA deposition reveals the importance of downstream cis-element sequences [^113r1ak1]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Evidence for an evolutionarily conserved m 6 A regulatory code in mouse and human

For all the findings in this work, our data consistently suggests that the same m 6 A cis -element code governs m 6 A deposition in both human and mouse. To comprehensively address this hypothesis, we implemented a head-to-head test comparison for the human iM6A model and the mouse iM6A model, both of which were trained on that species' genes from most chromosomes except chromosome 9. Thus, the genes from human chromosome 9 and mouse chromosome 9 offered two independent testing datasets being untouched for both the human and mouse iM6A models during their training. Human and mouse iM6A model performed comparably on both chromosome 9 transcripts (Fig. 7a, b), supporting that a common cis -element code governed the m 6 A deposition in both human and mouse. To further investigate the possibility of a common cis -element code, we compared the protein sequence conservation between human and mouse for the known components of the m 6 A methyltransferase complex including METTL3, METTL14, WTAP, and VIRMA (Fig. 7c), and found that > 95% of amino acids were identical for each of the four proteins between human and mouse, supporting their functional conservation and, therefore, the likelihood of the cis -elements code commonality.

### The complete sequence and comparative analysis of ape sex chromosomes [^111Fgt4i]. Nature (2024). Excellent credibility.

In the sequences with interspecies variation, 83–86% of base pairs on the X chromosome and 99% of bases on the Y chromosome were affected by large-scale structural variants (Fig. 1c, Supplementary Figs. 3 and 4), and the remaining base pairs were affected by single nucleotide variants (Supplementary Table 10 and Methods). Inversions were abundant on the Y chromosome (Supplementary Table 10), consistent with its palindromic architecture. Inversions and insertions were approximately eightfold and threefold longer on the Y chromosome than on the X chromosome, respectively (average sizes of 12.1 Mb versus 1.5 Mb and 38.2 kb versus 11.1 kb, respectively; P < 2.2 × 10 −16, Wilcoxon ranked-sum tests). The number of structural variants correlated positively with the lengths of phylogenetic branches (Supplementary Fig. 5 and Supplementary Table 11), with a greater slope for the Y chromosome (15.8 structural variants per Mb per million years) than for the X chromosome (6.1 structural variants per Mb per million years), indicating a more rapid accumulation of structural variants on the Y chromosome than on the X chromosome. To identify structural variants with potential functional significance in the human lineage, we studied overlaps with genes for 334 and 1,711 human-specific structural variants on the Y and X chromosomes, respectively (Supplementary Data 1–5 and Supplementary Table 12). On the Y chromosome, we detected an insertion of the previously reported 3.7-Mb X-transposed region — a human-specific duplication from the X chromosome to the Y chromosome — that includes 13 genes. Outside of gene copy number changes, human-specific inversions affected 11 genes on the Y chromosome, and human-specific insertions and deletions affected 23 genes on the X chromosome. Thus, structural variants represent one of the dominant types of genetic variation on the X chromosome and particularly on the Y chromosome, and might have functional consequences.

### Numerous potentially functional but non-genic conserved sequences on human chromosome 21 [^117P2bHP]. Nature (2002). Excellent credibility.

The use of comparative genomics to infer genome function relies on the understanding of how different components of the genome change over evolutionary time. The aim of such comparative analysis is to identify conserved, functionally transcribed sequences such as protein-coding genes and non-coding RNA genes, and other functional sequences such as regulatory regions, as well as other genomic features. Here, we have compared the entire human chromosome 21 with syntenic regions of the mouse genome, and have identified a large number of conserved blocks of unknown function. Although previous studies have made similar observations, it is unknown whether these conserved sequences are genes or not. Here we present an extensive experimental and computational analysis of human chromosome 21 in an effort to assign function to sequences conserved between human chromosome 21 (ref. 8) and the syntenic mouse regions. Our data support the presence of a large number of potentially functional non-genic sequences, probably regulatory and structural. The integration of the properties of the conserved components of human chromosome 21 to the rapidly accumulating functional data for this chromosome will improve considerably our understanding of the role of sequence conservation in mammalian genomes.

### Interphase human chromosome exhibits out of equilibrium glassy dynamics [^114a9EkW]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Single loci mean square displacements are heterogeneous

In order to ascertain the consequences of glassy dynamics at the microscopic level, we plot the MSD, Δ(t) = in Fig. 7 where r com is the position of center of mass of the whole chromosome, from which a few conclusions can be drawn.

### Long-read sequencing reveals the complex structure of extra dic (21; 21) chromosome and its biological effects [^113tBmYt]. Human Genetics (2023). Medium credibility.

The chromosome analysis in our previous study revealed that the patient's extra chr21 is dicentric (Takano et al.). In general, a chromosome with two centromeres cannot be stably transmitted to daughter cells because such a chromosome is pulled to opposite poles during mitosis. Therefore, inactivation of one of the two centromeres by deletion or epigenetic modification is required for stable segregation, as seen in Robertsonian translocations (Earnshaw et al; Sullivan and Schwartz). Since the patient's extra chr21 is stably transmitted to daughter cells (Takano et al.), we hypothesized that one of the two centromeres is epigenetically inactivated. Our allele-specific methylation analysis showed that the pericentromeric regions of the maternal chr21 of the patient were hypermethylated compared to that of the paternal chr21 (Fig. 2 C, D). This observation supports our hypothesis. Additionally, this analysis showed hypermethylation in the oscillated region of the maternal chr21 (Fig. 2 C, D). It is well known that one of the two X chromosomes is inactivated by a dosage compensation mechanism that includes DNA methylation in female cells. Several reports have shown that the dosage compensation response could occur for any type of aneuploidy (Disteche). Hence, it is possible that such a mechanism caused the hypermethylation in the oscillated region.

This is the first comprehensive study of a complex chromosome abnormality using long-read sequencing and novel bioinformatics methods. Thus, it successfully revealed the structures of all junctions associated with copy number changes, reconstructed the sequence of extra chr21, and examined the methylation changes occurring in extra chr21. Additionally, it demonstrated alterations in gene expressions and methylations caused by the presence of extra chr21. These findings provide an accurate characterization of the structure of extra chr21, shed light on the associated epigenetic changes, and suggest potential mechanisms underlying the generation of this abnormal chromosome.

### Assembly of 43 human Y chromosomes reveals extensive complexity and variation [^117JKnUR]. Nature (2023). Excellent credibility.

The prevalence of highly repetitive sequences within the human Y chromosome has prevented its complete assembly to date 1 and led to its systematic omission from genomic analyses. Here we present de novo assemblies of 43 Y chromosomes spanning 182,900 years of human evolution and report considerable diversity in size and structure. Half of the male-specific euchromatic region is subject to large inversions with a greater than twofold higher recurrence rate compared with all other chromosomes 2. Ampliconic sequences associated with these inversions show differing mutation rates that are sequence context dependent, and some ampliconic genes exhibit evidence for concerted evolution with the acquisition and purging of lineage-specific pseudogenes. The largest heterochromatic region in the human genome, Yq12, is composed of alternating repeat arrays that show extensive variation in the number, size and distribution, but retain a 1:1 copy-number ratio. Finally, our data suggest that the boundary between the recombining pseudoautosomal region 1 and the non-recombining portions of the X and Y chromosomes lies 500kb away from the currently established 1 boundary. The availability of fully sequence-resolved Y chromosomes from multiple individuals provides a unique opportunity for identifying new associations of traits with specific Y-chromosomal variants and garnering insights into the evolution and function of complex regions of the human genome.

### Chromosome architecture and low cohesion bias acrocentric chromosomes towards aneuploidy during mammalian meiosis [^111Tf3vx]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Human acrocentric chromosomes often form incorrect kinetochore-microtubule attachments

We next asked whether the kinetochores of acrocentric chromosomes in human oocytes are also partially masked and more likely to be incorrectly attached to microtubules. We identified acro- and metacentric chromosomes based on the position of telomeres relative to kinetochores (Fig. 5a). As expected, we detected bivalents in human oocytes with kinetochores with proximal telomeres (acrocentric) and without proximal telomeres (metacentric) (Fig. 5b). Analysis of kinetochore-microtubule attachments in human oocytes showed that about 50% of kinetochores of acrocentric chromosomes formed end-on attachments compared to about 70% of kinetochores of metacentric chromosomes (Fig. 5c, d), similar to our observations in porcine oocytes. In addition, 23% of kinetochores of acrocentric chromosomes formed lateral/merotelic attachments compared to 13% of kinetochores of metacentric chromosomes (Fig. 5c, d). All human oocytes were monitored for chromosome alignment and fixed at around 15 h 30 min post-NEBD. However, we cannot rule out that individual oocytes might have been at slightly different stages of development at the time of fixation. Thus, also in human oocytes, kinetochores with proximal telomeres were more likely to be incorrectly attached to microtubules than those without proximal telomeres.

### Current status of human chromosome 14 [^112DiCch]. Journal of Medical Genetics (2002). Low credibility.

Over the past three decades, extensive genetic, physical, transcript, and sequence maps have assisted in the mapping of over 30 genetic diseases and in the identification of over 550 genes on human chromosome 14. Additional genetic disorders were assigned to chromosome 14 by studying either constitutional or acquired chromosome aberrations of affected subjects. Studies of benign and malignant tumours by karyotype analyses and by allelotyping with a panel of polymorphic genetic markers have further suggested the presence of several tumour suppressor loci on chromosome 14. The search for disease genes on human chromosome 14 has also been achieved by exploiting the human-mouse comparative maps. Research on uniparental disomy and on the search for imprinted genes has supported evidence of epigenetic inheritance as a result of imprinting on human chromosome 14. This review focuses on the current developments on human chromosome 14 with respect to genetic maps, physical maps, transcript maps, sequence maps, genes, diseases, mouse-human comparative maps, and imprinting.

### The complete sequence and comparative analysis of ape sex chromosomes [^113fi1HL]. Nature (2024). Excellent credibility.

Main

Therian X and Y chromosomes are thought to have originated from a pair of autosomes around 170 million years ago. The X chromosome, which is typically present as two copies in females and one copy in males, has mostly retained the gene content and order from the original autosomal pair. The Y chromosome, which is typically present as one copy in males, has acquired the sex-determining gene SRY and other male-specific genes and mutations, which were fixed by inversions that prevented recombination between the Y and X chromosomes over most of their lengths. Lacking recombination, the Y chromosome has contracted in size and accumulated deleterious mutations and repetitive elements, leading to differences in size and gene content between the Y and X chromosomes. The recent human T2T (gapless and complete) assembly revealed an X chromosome of around 154 Mb with 796 protein-coding genes, and a Y chromosome of around 62 Mb with 106 protein-coding genes. In addition to the pseudoautosomal regions (PARs), where the Y chromosome still recombines with the X chromosome, and ancestral regions, which originated from the original autosomal pair, the human Y chromosome has long ampliconic regions with extensive intrachromosomal homology. Ampliconic regions harbour palindromes — long inverted repeats that undergo gene conversion, which counteracts the accumulation of deleterious mutations. Similar to the human Y chromosome, the human X chromosome possesses PARs, ancestral regions and several palindromes.

### The physical maps for sequencing human chromosomes 1, 6, 9, 10, 13, 20 and X [^111rN3mF]. Nature (2001). Excellent credibility.

We constructed maps for eight chromosomes (1, 6, 9, 10, 13, 20, X and (previously) 22), representing one-third of the genome, by building landmark maps, isolating bacterial clones and assembling contigs. By this approach, we could establish the long-range organization of the maps early in the project, and all contig extension, gap closure and problem-solving was simplified by containment within local regions. The maps currently represent more than 94% of the euchromatic (gene-containing) regions of these chromosomes in 176 contigs, and contain 96% of the chromosome-specific markers in the human gene map. By measuring the remaining gaps, we can assess chromosome length and coverage in sequenced clones.

### Continuous synthesis of E. coli genome sections and Mb-scale human DNA assembly [^115virAY]. Nature (2023). Excellent credibility.

We next demonstrated that BASIS can be used to assemble large sections of human genomic DNA, including exonic, intronic and intergenic regions, into a single episome. We focussed on assembling a 1.1 Mb region of the human genome within chromosome 21. This region includes repetitive sequences, G-quadruplexes, and LINEs/SINEs (Fig. 3d). Further analysis indicated that these features, as well as gene density, occur within this 1.1 Mb region at comparable levels to their median levels in the genome (Extended Data Fig. 7).

We started with a library of human BACs used for the essentially complete sequencing of the human genome, each of these human BACs contains approximately 170 kb of human DNA. We used one step of λ-red recombination to convert nine members of the human BAC library, covering the targeted 1.1 Mb region of chromosome 21, into donor BACs for BASIS; this step introduced a positive- and negative-selection cassette, uHR, oriT, and universal spacers (Extended Data Fig. 4 and Supplementary Data 15–17). The human DNA sequences in these BACs overlap by 14–122 kb.

We performed nine steps of BASIS to assemble an episome containing 1.1 Mb of human DNA in E. coli. We identified clones with the correct marker swap, on the basis of their phenotypes and/or genotypes, after each step of BASIS (Methods). We verified the correct assembly of these clones using short-read sequencing (Fig. 3d) and used a correctly assembled clone as the input for the next step of BASIS. The final assembly was characterized by short- and long-read sequencing (Fig. 3d). Across the 1.1 Mb sequence, we observed four single-base insertions or deletions in mononucleotide repeats, and one 69 base contraction in a TA-rich repeat (Supplementary Data 12, 18 and 19). These repeat sequences are of variable length in the human populationas a result of polymerase slippage during replication, which increases the mutation rate by orders of magnitude at these loci to 10–5 to10 -3 per locus per generation; as these sequences go through approximately 300 replication cycles in their generation by BASIS, it is not surprising that some of the diversity found in humans is regenerated in the assembly. We conclude that BASIS enables the high-fidelity, megabase-scale assembly of human DNA with representative gene density, repetitive sequences, G-quadruplexes, and LINEs/SINEs.

### Practice bulletin no. 162: prenatal diagnostic testing for genetic disorders [^117GUMSZ]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2016). Medium credibility.

Chromosome number and structure abnormalities in prenatal diagnosis encompass aneuploidy as the most common abnormality of chromosome number with an extra or missing chromosome or chromosomes, possible extra sets of chromosomes (eg, triploidy or tetraploidy), and mosaicism in which the abnormal number is not present in all cell lines; structural aberrations include deletions, duplications, translocations, and other rearrangements, with large lesions identified by karyotype and small microdeletions or duplications detectable only via chromosomal microarray, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), or other specialized methods; chromosomal translocations can be balanced, meaning the normal genomic content is preserved but rearranged, or unbalanced with pieces duplicated or missing, and balanced chromosomal translocations most often are associated with a normal phenotype, especially if inherited, although they can lead to recurrent miscarriage or an increased risk of a genetic abnormality in offspring, and some translocations may be missing genetic material that can be clinically significant, especially when they are new mutations rather than inherited.

### Combinations of chromosome transfer and genome editing for the development of cell / animal models of human disease and humanized animal models [^116KZ9rV]. Journal of Human Genetics (2018). Low credibility.

Chromosome transfer technology, including chromosome modification, enables the introduction of Mb-sized or multiple genes to desired cells or animals. This technology has allowed innovative developments to be made for models of human disease and humanized animals, including Down syndrome model mice and humanized transchromosomic (Tc) immunoglobulin mice. Genome editing techniques are developing rapidly, and permit modifications such as gene knockout and knockin to be performed in various cell lines and animals. This review summarizes chromosome transfer-related technologies and the combined technologies of chromosome transfer and genome editing mainly for the production of cell/animal models of human disease and humanized animal models. Specifically, these include: (1) chromosome modification with genome editing in Chinese hamster ovary cells and mouse A9 cells for efficient transfer to desired cell types; (2) single-nucleotide polymorphism modification in humanized Tc mice with genome editing; and (3) generation of a disease model of Down syndrome-associated hematopoiesis abnormalities by the transfer of human chromosome 21 to normal human embryonic stem cells and the induction of mutation(s) in the endogenous gene(s) with genome editing. These combinations of chromosome transfer and genome editing open up new avenues for drug development and therapy as well as for basic research.

### Recorded interviews with human and medical geneticists [^115uTJv8]. Human Genetics (2017). Low credibility.

Cancer genetics has been part of human cytogenetics since techniques permitted a meaningful analysis of human chromosomes, indeed even before this — study of chromosomes in tumours was the key factor stimulating Levan and Tjio to determine unambiguously the normal human chromosome number. After Nowell and Hungerford had first shown a specific somatic chromosome abnormality in chronic myeloid leukaemia, the field of cancer cytogenetics was advanced further by Lore Zech's discovery of banding in human chromosomes [28], (Caspersson et al.), and the increasing volume of research internationally brought together by the Cancer Chromosome Database of Felix Mitelman [92]; both are represented in the interview series, as are a number of other workers in the field (see Table 5).

Table 5
Principal themes of interview series cancer and genetics

Biochemical genetics was an important element of human genetics from the outset, indeed from the time of Garrod's original discovery of inborn errors of metabolism at the beginning of the 20th Century, though not always such an integral part of it as has been cytogenetics. Among those interviewees involved with research on inherited metabolic disorders some, such as Jean Frézal and Charles Scriver, were closely identified with broader medical genetics, while others were more based in biochemistry, the former group being those mainly represented in the interview series (Table 6). An important group of workers involved in human biochemical genetics were those engaged in human gene mapping, especially in the decades 1970–1990, before molecular genetic approaches became dominant. This group in turn overlapped with those in population and statistical genetics (Table 7).

### Generation and annotation of the DNA sequences of human chromosomes 2 and 4 [^116zz2uf]. Nature (2005). Excellent credibility.

Human chromosome 2 is unique to the human lineage in being the product of a head-to-head fusion of two intermediate-sized ancestral chromosomes. Chromosome 4 has received attention primarily related to the search for the Huntington's disease gene, but also for genes associated with Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome, polycystic kidney disease and a form of muscular dystrophy. Here we present approximately 237 million base pairs of sequence for chromosome 2, and 186 million base pairs for chromosome 4, representing more than 99.6% of their euchromatic sequences. Our initial analyses have identified 1,346 protein-coding genes and 1,239 pseudogenes on chromosome 2, and 796 protein-coding genes and 778 pseudogenes on chromosome 4. Extensive analyses confirm the underlying construction of the sequence, and expand our understanding of the structure and evolution of mammalian chromosomes, including gene deserts, segmental duplications and highly variant regions.

### PICH promotes sister chromatid disjunction and co-operates with topoisomerase II in mitosis [^115W8hkV]. Nature Communications (2015). Medium credibility.

Abnormal chromosome structure in PICH-deficient human cells

To strengthen and extend the proposal that PICH co-operates with Topo IIα in effecting sister chromatid decatenation, we generated a PICH-deficient human cell line (derived from HeLa cells) using CRISPR-Cas9-mediated gene disruption (Methods). We observed that the PICH-deficient human cells showed a similar spectrum of chromosome instability in mitosis as is seen in PICH −/− DT40 cells, including micro- and bi-nucleation (Supplementary Fig. 6). However, the primary reason for generating a PICH −/− human cell was to permit a more robust analysis of metaphase chromosome structure, which is technically easier with human than with chicken chromosomes. An established consequence of Topo IIα inhibition by ICRF-193 is the failure of the chromosomes in metaphase to adopt the normal hyper-condensed, X-shaped morphology. Instead, metaphases from ICRF-193-treated cells show an excess of under-condensed chromosomes that do not appear to have undergone complete arm decatenation (giving a 'closed-arm' appearance; Fig. 8). We observed that metaphases from the PICH knockout human cells contained a significantly higher frequency of chromosomes with an undercondensed, closed-arm appearance than did the control metaphases (Fig. 8). This abnormality was partially suppressed by ectopic expression of the wild-type PICH protein, but not the PICH-K128A protein (Fig. 8). We conclude, therefore, that PICH-deficient human cells generate metaphase chromosomes with an appearance similar to that of ICRF-193-treated normal cells, consistent with a defect in sister chromatid condensation and decatenation before anaphase.

### Applications of genomic microarrays to explore human chromosome structure and function [^111o7rHi]. Human Molecular Genetics (2004). Low credibility.

The combination of genomic microarrays with comparative genomic hybridization and with chromatin immunoprecipitation is providing an increasingly detailed view of the way in which the human genome is organized and functions and how disorganization and disfunction can lead to disease. These studies are enhanced by the flexibility of array technology, allowing resolutions from coverage of the whole genome using 200 kb cloned DNA inserts to detailed analysis using PCR products or oligonucleotides of 100 bp or less. In particular, the use of chromatin immunoprecipitation is providing new insights into chromosome structure and gene regulation and control through the analysis of protein — DNA interactions.

### Detection of large-scale variation in the human genome [^114Ateho]. Nature Genetics (2004). Medium credibility.

We identified 255 loci across the human genome that contain genomic imbalances among unrelated individuals. Twenty-four variants are present in > 10% of the individuals that we examined. Half of these regions overlap with genes, and many coincide with segmental duplications or gaps in the human genome assembly. This previously unappreciated heterogeneity may underlie certain human phenotypic variation and susceptibility to disease and argues for a more dynamic human genome structure.

### Orientation-dependent dxz4 contacts shape the 3D structure of the inactive X chromosome [^116GiMKR]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Very little reactivation of X-linked genes, even in the presence of a demethylating agent, was observed in mutant cells, attesting to the multiple layers of control that ensure silencing of the X. Rather, our findings of clonal variability suggest that de-condensation of the Xi in Del-hinge may facilitate stochastic dysregulation of a few X-linked genes (Fig. 9). A similar level of clonal variability was reported in human cells, as well as in mouse ES cells, the latter with a deletion of the hinge induced prior to XCI, in which loss of escape from XCI was observed for a single-cell clone, but was not confirmed in others. Taken together, these results indicate that Dxz4 mutations induced either prior to XCI or following XCI do not result in widespread changes in gene expression. No changes in the repressive histone mark H3K27me3 enrichment on the Xi were observed in our mutant lines, but we cannot exclude local changes around the locus, or a shift in Xi replication timing from early to late as observed in human cells.

### Single-cell Hi-C reveals cell-to-cell variability in chromosome structure [^1118AJYR]. Nature (2013). Excellent credibility.

Large-scale chromosome structure and spatial nuclear arrangement have been linked to control of gene expression and DNA replication and repair. Genomic techniques based on chromosome conformation capture (3C) assess contacts for millions of loci simultaneously, but do so by averaging chromosome conformations from millions of nuclei. Here we introduce single-cell Hi-C, combined with genome-wide statistical analysis and structural modelling of single-copy X chromosomes, to show that individual chromosomes maintain domain organization at the megabase scale, but show variable cell-to-cell chromosome structures at larger scales. Despite this structural stochasticity, localization of active gene domains to boundaries of chromosome territories is a hallmark of chromosomal conformation. Single-cell Hi-C data bridge current gaps between genomics and microscopy studies of chromosomes, demonstrating how modular organization underlies dynamic chromosome structure, and how this structure is probabilistically linked with genome activity patterns.

### Clinical management of mosaic results from preimplantation genetic testing for aneuploidy of blastocysts: a committee opinion [^115XNjrQ]. Fertility and Sterility (2023). High credibility.

Mosaicism reporting in PGT-A — definition and next-generation sequencing (NGS) inference explains that mosaicism is defined as the presence of more than one chromosomally distinct cell line in one individual, and in humans, any variation from 46 chromosomes is considered aneuploid. Mosaicism is diagnosed after a standard cytogenetic karyotype on samples such as blood or amniotic fluid, whereas next-generation sequencing (NGS), the most common method of analysis in PGT-A, uses a bioinformatics algorithm to measure the amount of DNA represented by each chromosome compared with a normal reference, so in trophectoderm biopsy the diagnosis is inferred by observing an intermediate chromosome copy number on an NGS profile rather than by visual observation of distinct euploid and aneuploid cells. An intermediate copy number between 2 and 3 (disomy and trisomy ranges) may be interpreted as mosaic trisomy, whereas between 1 and 2 (monosomy and disomy ranges) may be interpreted as mosaic monosomy.

### Human Y chromosome copy number variation in the next generation sequencing era and beyond [^115wujU1]. Human Genetics (2017). Low credibility.

The human Y chromosome provides a fertile ground for structural rearrangements owing to its haploidy and high content of repeated sequences. The methodologies used for copy number variation (CNV) studies have developed over the years. Low-throughput techniques based on direct observation of rearrangements were developed early on, and are still used, often to complement array-based or sequencing approaches which have limited power in regions with high repeat content and specifically in the presence of long, identical repeats, such as those found in human sex chromosomes. Some specific rearrangements have been investigated for decades; because of their effects on fertility, or their outstanding evolutionary features, the interest in these has not diminished. However, following the flourishing of large-scale genomics, several studies have investigated CNVs across the whole chromosome. These studies sometimes employ data generated within large genomic projects such as the DDD study or the 1000 Genomes Project, and often survey large samples of healthy individuals without any prior selection. Novel technologies based on sequencing long molecules and combinations of technologies, promise to stimulate the study of Y-CNVs in the immediate future.

### Long-read sequencing of primate testis and human sperm allows identification of recombination events in individuals [^1124sPa8]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Likewise, the boundary cases, where an SNV at the end of a read changes haplotype, are expected to be a mixture of COs and GCVs in proportion to their estimated frequency. We can estimate the expected number of these that are COs and GCVs, respectively, and the sum of these matches well with the observed boundary cases (Supplementary Table 4). Together, our checks suggest that the detected sets of curated COs and GCVs are reliable.

Genomic distributions of crossovers and gene conversions

Next, we investigated the genomic distribution of CO and GCV events across the genome (Fig. 1b, sample HS35, see also Supplementary Fig. 1. The remaining samples are shown in Supplementary Fig. 2). COs seem particularly clustered towards the telomeres, whereas GCVs are more uniformly distributed. The human chromosome 2 originated from a fusion of two chromosomes in the human lineage (chromosomes 2A and 2B in the chimpanzee). When comparing the distribution on human chromosome 2 with chimpanzee chromosome 2A and 2B (Fig. 1c), we observe that the enrichment at the telomeres of the chimpanzee chromosomes is not found in humans at the position where they fused.

We also investigated the density of COs and GCVs across each chromosome after all human, gorilla and chimpanzee samples were pooled (omitting chromosome 2). Whereas the density of COs decreases with increasing chromosome size (Supplementary Fig. 4a, P < 0.001, linear regression of density of COs with chromosome size), the density of GCVs is not correlated with chromosome size (Supplementary Fig. 4b, P = 0.10). This results in a decreasing CO/GCV with increasing chromosome size (Supplementary Fig. 4c, P = 0.00077). Thus, the larger recombination rate per base pair on small chromosomes is due to a higher proportion of the DSBs resolved as COs as also reported by Palsson et al.

### The divergence of neandertal and modern human Y chromosomes [^114GxH1B]. American Journal of Human Genetics (2016). Low credibility.

Sequencing the genomes of extinct hominids has reshaped our understanding of modern human origins. Here, we analyze ∼120 kb of exome-captured Y-chromosome DNA from a Neandertal individual from El Sidrón, Spain. We investigate its divergence from orthologous chimpanzee and modern human sequences and find strong support for a model that places the Neandertal lineage as an outgroup to modern human Y chromosomes — including A00, the highly divergent basal haplogroup. We estimate that the time to the most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) of Neandertal and modern human Y chromosomes is ∼588 thousand years ago (kya) (95% confidence interval [CI]: 447–806 kya). This is ∼2.1 (95% CI: 1.7–2.9) times longer than the TMRCA of A00 and other extant modern human Y-chromosome lineages. This estimate suggests that the Y-chromosome divergence mirrors the population divergence of Neandertals and modern human ancestors, and it refutes alternative scenarios of a relatively recent or super-archaic origin of Neandertal Y chromosomes. The fact that the Neandertal Y we describe has never been observed in modern humans suggests that the lineage is most likely extinct. We identify protein-coding differences between Neandertal and modern human Y chromosomes, including potentially damaging changes to PCDH11Y, TMSB4Y, USP9Y, and KDM5D. Three of these changes are missense mutations in genes that produce male-specific minor histocompatibility (H-Y) antigens. Antigens derived from KDM5D, for example, are thought to elicit a maternal immune response during gestation. It is possible that incompatibilities at one or more of these genes played a role in the reproductive isolation of the two groups.

### The first mitotic division of human embryos is highly error prone [^111HVFEu]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Human beings are made of ~50 trillion cells which arise from serial mitotic divisions of a single cell - the fertilised egg. Remarkably, the early human embryo is often chromosomally abnormal, and many are mosaic, with the karyotype differing from one cell to another. Mosaicism presumably arises from chromosome segregation errors during the early mitotic divisions, although these events have never been visualised in living human embryos. Here, we establish live cell imaging of chromosome segregation using normally fertilised embryos from an egg-share-to-research programme, as well as embryos deselected during fertility treatment. We reveal that the first mitotic division has an extended prometaphase/metaphase and exhibits phenotypes that can cause nondisjunction. These included multipolar chromosome segregations and lagging chromosomes that lead to formation of micronuclei. Analysis of nuclear number and size provides evidence of equivalent phenotypes in 2-cell human embryos that gave rise to live births. Together this shows that errors in the first mitotic division can be tolerated in human embryos and uncovers cell biological events that contribute to preimplantation mosaicism.

### Genome maps across 26 human populations reveal population-specific patterns of structural variation [^11676DBC]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Characterization of SDs in subtelomeric regions

SDs contribute to human evolution, adaptation, and genomic instability but are poorly characterized. SDs represent ~5% of the genome and are frequently found near centromeres and telomeres –. Among 126 Mb of known SDs (≥ 10 kb in length and ≥ 95% sequence identity), 49 Mb were in the complex regions, 36 Mb were in inaccessible or low-coverage regions, and the remaining 41 Mb were scattered across 2.65 Gb of low structural complexity regions. On average, SDs in complex regions (median 82 kb) were significantly longer than SDs in low structural complexity regions (median 32 kb) and had significantly higher sequence identity (median 99.4% vs 97.4%). These long and extremely similar SDs are intractable with most sequencing technologies but can be reconstructed using long optical map molecules.

### The international glossary on infertility and fertility care, 2017 [^114fQHeh]. Fertility and Sterility (2017). Medium credibility.

International glossary on infertility and fertility care — key definitions include: Spontaneous abortion/miscarriage is the spontaneous loss of an intra-uterine pregnancy prior to 22 completed weeks of gestational age. Stillbirth is the death of a fetus before complete expulsion or extraction after 28 completed weeks of gestational age and is determined when the separated fetus does not breathe or show any other evidence of life such as heartbeat, umbilical cord pulsation, or definite movement of voluntary muscles. Stillbirth rate is the number of stillbirths per 1000 total births (stillbirths plus live births). Time to pregnancy (TTP) is the time taken to establish a pregnancy, measured in months or in numbers of menstrual cycles. Total delivery rate with at least one live birth counts the total number of deliveries with at least one live birth resulting from one initiated or aspirated ART cycle, including only cycles in which fresh and/or frozen embryos are transferred and allowing more than one delivery from one initiated or aspirated cycle if that occurs until all embryos are used; the delivery of a singleton, twin or other multiple pregnancy is registered as one delivery, and in the absence of complete data, the total delivery rate is often estimated. Total fertility rate (TFR) is the average number of live births per woman. Total sperm count is the calculated total number of sperm in the ejaculate, defined as semen volume multiplied by the sperm concentration determined from an aliquot of semen. Teratozoospermia is a reduced percentage of morphologically normal sperm in the ejaculate below the lower reference limits, and when reporting results the reference criteria should be specified. Trisomy denotes an abnormal number of chromosome copies with three homologous chromosomes rather than the normal two, and the majority of human embryos with trisomies are incompatible with life. Unisomy denotes loss of a single chromosome yielding a single copy rather than the normal two, and the majority of unisomies in human embryos are incompatible with life. Unexplained infertility refers to infertility in couples with apparently normal ovarian function, Fallopian tubes, uterus, cervix and pelvis with adequate coital frequency, and apparently normal testicular function, genito-urinary anatomy and a normal ejaculate; the potential for this diagnosis depends on the methodologies used and/or those available.

### The X chromosome and male infertility [^114C1FCH]. Human Genetics (2021). Medium credibility.

The X chromosome is a key player in germ cell development, as has been highlighted for males in previous studies revealing that the mammalian X chromosome is enriched in genes expressed in early spermatogenesis. In this review, we focus on the X chromosome's unique biology as associated with human male infertility. Male infertility is most commonly caused by spermatogenic defects to which X chromosome dosage is closely linked; for example, any supernumerary X chromosome as in Klinefelter syndrome will lead to male infertility. Furthermore, because males normally only have a single X chromosome and because X-linked genetic anomalies are generally only present in a single copy in males, any loss-of-function mutations in single-copy X-chromosomal genes cannot be compensated by a normal allele. These features make X-linked genes particularly attractive for studying male spermatogenic failure. However, to date, only very few genetic causes have been identified as being definitively responsible for male infertility in humans. Although genetic studies of germ cell-enriched X-chromosomal genes in mice suggest a role of certain human orthologs in infertile men, these genes in mice and humans have striking evolutionary differences. Furthermore, the complexity and highly repetitive structure of the X chromosome hinder the mutational analysis of X-linked genes in humans. Therefore, we conclude that additional methodological approaches are urgently warranted to advance our understanding of the genetics of X-linked male infertility.

### The biological basis of sex differences in athletic performance: consensus statement for the American College of Sports Medicine [^1143PXpQ]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2023). High credibility.

Box 1: Definitions — sex is a multidimensional biological construct based on anatomy, physiology, genetics, and hormones (sex traits) and is an objective term defined for reproduction with distinct, fixed facets including genetic, chromosomal, gonadal, hormonal, and phenotypic (including genital) sex. Biological sex is typically dichotomous as male and female, and disorders (or differences) of sex development are rare conditions in which development of chromosomal, gonadal, and anatomic sex is atypical. Females (mammals) possess XX chromosomes, have ovaries, and produce oocytes, whereas males (mammals) possess XY chromosomes, have testes, and produce spermatozoa. Gender is a multidimensional human construct encompassing gender identity and expression and social and cultural expectations associated with certain sex traits, can vary between societies and over time, and involves perception of the individual as male, female, or someone who does not fit these constructs; human gender is a spectrum from feminine to gender-neutral to masculine. Cisgender individuals are those whose gender identity corresponds with their biological sex (or the sex designated at birth), while transgender individuals are those whose gender identity differs or is opposite from their biological sex (or the sex designated at birth). Sex hormones refer to peptide and steroid sex hormones secreted by the pituitary and the gonads; many other organs can make de novo steroid sex hormones from cholesterol, but after puberty (and until menopause in women) the gonads are the major site for synthesis and secretion of sex steroid hormones.

### Long-read sequencing reveals the complex structure of extra dic (21; 21) chromosome and its biological effects [^11334G4g]. Human Genetics (2023). Medium credibility.

Analysis of breakpoint sequences

The causes of SVs can be inferred from the structures of the breakpoints (Fujimoto et al; Kidd et al.). To analyze these structures, we aligned the consensus sequences of the breakpoints to the reference genome sequences covering upstream and downstream regions (Fujimoto et al.) and examined the homology length and insertion between breakpoints (Table S5, Fig. S9). SV-ID 2, SV-ID 3, and SV-ID 4 had no insertion between breakpoints but had microhomologies of 4 bp, 5 bp, and 5 bp, respectively (Fig. S9B–D). SV-ID 14 had microhomologies of 3 bp between the junction of blocks S and U, and 2 bp between the junction of blocks U and Y (Fig. S9K). All other SVs (SV-ID 5, 6, 7, 9, SV-ID 8, SV-ID 9, SV-ID 10, SV-ID 11, SV-ID 12, SV-ID 13, and SV-ID 15) had insertions at breakpoints (Fig. S9E–J, L).

### Addressing sex as a biological variable in preclinical models of lung disease: an official American Thoracic Society research statement [^116UvBwo]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2025). High credibility.

American Thoracic Society (ATS) research statement — integrating and investigating sex as a biological variable (SABV) in preclinical pulmonary models: Assessing SABV is of critical importance for designing and interpreting preclinical studies, and "Preclinical research" refers to research before testing in human volunteers, including animal studies and cell-based model systems (animal- and human-derived). The statement is organized in two sections, focusing on 1) animal models; and 2) in vitro models. The goals of this section include identifying rigorous experimental approaches and study designs to integrate and investigate the role of sex (chromosomal and gonadal) in preclinical animal models and creating a checklist for researchers as a guide and for journals and reviewers to assess rigor in scientific work and reproducibility for the consideration of SABV. Methods used to generate recommendations included articulating the scope of the research statement and the specific objectives, reviewing existing literature and data, identifying key issues and challenges, prioritizing recommendations and providing a rationale, and supporting with evidence.

### Human Y chromosome copy number variation in the next generation sequencing era and beyond [^113CUFCV]. Human Genetics (2017). Low credibility.

In its third and final phase, the 1000 Genomes Project increased its samples size to 2504 individuals from 26 populations, and its mean whole-genome depth to 7.4× (The 1000 Genomes Project Consortium). These resources enabled a large Y chromosome study to be carried out, which represents the widest description of MSY variation so far (Poznik et al.). This work tackled all aspects of the MSY diversity: sequencing data for 1,244 males were used to discover over ~60,000 SNPs, which then were used to reconstruct an extensive phylogenetic tree; variants in other classes, including indels and multiple nucleotide polymorphisms (MNPs), CNVs and short tandem repeats (STRs), were discovered as well, and projected onto the high-resolution phylogeny to investigate their mutational patterns and properties. The main discovery method for CNVs was again the analysis of sequence data, using Genome STRiP (Handsaker et al.), which infers structural rearrangements using the full information available from population-scale sequence data: local read depth variation, abnormal paired-end insert length, breakpoint-spanning reads, allele and haplotype sharing between samples, population heterogeneity caused by variant alleles, and negative correlation between alternative alleles (referred to as "allelic substitution") (Handsaker et al.). This approach was complemented by array CGH data, which were used to validate the Genome STRiP set, and call additional variants, for a total of 121 CNVs reported (100 in the Genome STRiP set only). A set of variants was validated using alkaline lysis fibre-FISH and molecular combing fibre-FISH, together with karyotyping for samples showing sex chromosomes aneuploidies. The unbiased phylogeny reconstructed in the study was leveraged to count the minimum number of mutational events for each locus (Fig. 3): the majority of variants were explained as single mutational events, although a few loci showed evidence for a high number of mutations; there was a higher prevalence of duplications compared to deletions. The presence of repetitive elements near putative breakpoints did not appear to be associated with highly mutable loci, although it appeared to be associated with longer variants, similar to observations on the autosomes (Conrad et al.) (Fig. 1). Unsurprisingly, CNVs were predicted to have larger phenotypic effect than single nucleotide variants, as inferred from overlap with protein-coding genes: however, deletions overlapping protein-coding genes appeared to be more abundant than duplications overlapping protein-coding genes, while in a reanalysis of 1000 Genomes Project autosomal data (Sudmant et al.) this relation appeared to be reversed. In other words, Y genes appeared to be more tolerant to deletions than autosomal genes, despite the haploidy of the chromosome, probably owing to their presence in multiple copies in many cases.

### Human artificial chromosomes for gene delivery and the development of animal models [^113qApHP]. Molecular Therapy (2011). Low credibility.

Random integration of conventional gene delivery vectors such as viruses, plasmids, P1 phage-derived artificial chromosomes, bacterial artificial chromosomes and yeast artificial chromosomes can be associated with transgene silencing. Furthermore, integrated viral sequences can activate oncogenes adjacent to the insertion site resulting in cancer. Various human artificial chromosomes (HACs) exhibit several potential characteristics desired for an ideal gene delivery vector, including stable episomal maintenance and the capacity to carry large genomic loci with their regulatory elements, thus allowing the physiological regulation of the introduced gene in a manner similar to that of native chromosomes. HACs have been generated mainly using either a "top-down approach" (engineered chromosomes), or a "bottom-up approach" (de novo artificial chromosomes). The recent emergence of stem cell-based tissue engineering has opened up new avenues for gene and cell therapies. This review describes the lessons learned and prospects identified mainly from studies in the construction of HACs and HAC-mediated gene expression systems in cultured cells, as well as in animals.

### Committee opinion no.682: microarrays and next-generation sequencing technology: the use of advanced genetic diagnostic tools in obstetrics and gynecology [^111yoz6M]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2016). Medium credibility.

Chromosomal microarray analysis — capabilities and copy number variants: Chromosomal microarray analysis is a method of measuring gains and losses of DNA throughout the human genome and can identify chromosomal aneuploidy and submicroscopic abnormalities that are too small to be detected by traditional modalities, with added submicroscopic resolution beyond karyotype. Duplicated or deleted sections of DNA at least 1,000 base pairs in size that differ from a representative reference genome are known as copy number variants (CNVs), and the term copy number variant does not imply clinical significance and often is qualified as pathogenic or benign to clarify clinical relevance. Pathogenic copy number variants may account for a sizable portion of the human genetic disease burden; by some estimates they are as high as 15%, and in prenatal diagnosis the probability of finding a pathogenic copy number variant is highly correlated with the presence of structural fetal abnormalities, although significant copy number variants also can be identified in structurally normal fetuses.

Genomic alterations and variant annotation — A comprehensive understanding of the wide range of possible genomic alterations is essential for bioinformaticians, including single-nucleotide variants (SNVs), small deletions, insertions, and other complex combinations (InDels), copy number variants (CNVs), structural variants (SVs), repeat expansions, epigenetic alterations such as DNA methylation, and intergenic variants; these genomic variations can occur at chromosomal or gene level and have diverse effects on protein function, including gain or loss of function, with SNVs and InDels leading to missense, nonsense, or frameshift changes and translocations resulting in gene fusions that produce a novel fusion protein with altered functionality; understanding Human Genome Variation Society (HGVS) variant nomenclature and predicted consequences is critical because these elements, collectively known as variant annotation, help characterize a genetic variant.

### XACT, a long noncoding transcript coating the active X chromosome in human pluripotent cells [^112j1MRv]. Nature Genetics (2013). Medium credibility.

X-chromosome inactivation (XCI) in mammals relies on XIST, a long noncoding transcript that coats and silences the X chromosome in cis. Here we report the discovery of a long noncoding RNA, XACT, that is expressed from and coats the active X chromosome specifically in human pluripotent cells. In the absence of XIST, XACT is expressed from both X chromosomes in humans but not in mice, suggesting a unique role for XACT in the control of human XCI initiation.

### Inactivation status of PCDH11X: sexual dimorphisms in gene expression levels in brain [^117G9YUC]. Human Genetics (2006). Low credibility.

Genes escaping X-inactivation are predicted to contribute to differences in gene dosage between the sexes and are the prime candidates for being involved in the phenotype observed in individuals with X chromosome aneuploidies. Of particular interest is ProtocadherinX (PCDH11X or PCDHX), a recently described gene expressed in brain. In humans, PCDH11X has a homologue on the Y chromosome and is predicted to escape from X-inactivation. Employing bisulphite sequencing analysis we found absence of CpG island methylation on both the active and the inactive X chromosomes, providing a strong indication that PCDH11X escapes inactivation in humans. Furthermore, a sexual dimorphism in levels of expression in brain tissue was observed by quantitative real-time PCR, with females presenting an up to 2-fold excess in the abundance of PCDH11X transcripts. We relate these findings to sexually dimorphic traits in the human brain. Interestingly, PCDH11X/Y gene pair is unique to Homo sapiens, since the X-linked gene was transposed to the Y chromosome after the human-chimpanzee lineages split. Although no differences in promoter methylation were found between humans and chimpanzees, evidence of an upregulation of PCDH11X in humans deserves further investigation.

### Species differences in TSIX / tsix reveal the roles of these genes in X-chromosome inactivation [^113ZMFbD]. American Journal of Human Genetics (2002). Low credibility.

Transcriptional silencing of the human inactive X chromosome is induced by the XIST gene within the human X-inactivation center. The XIST allele must be turned off on one X chromosome to maintain its activity in cells of both sexes. In the mouse placenta, where X inactivation is imprinted (the paternal X chromosome is always inactive), the maternal Xist allele is repressed by a cis-acting antisense transcript, encoded by the Tsix gene. However, it remains to be seen whether this antisense transcript protects the future active X chromosome during random inactivation in the embryo proper. We recently identified the human TSIX gene and showed that it lacks key regulatory elements needed for the imprinting function of murine Tsix. Now, using RNA FISH for cellular localization of transcripts in human fetal cells, we show that human TSIX antisense transcripts are unable to repress XIST. In fact, TSIX is transcribed only from the inactive X chromosome and is coexpressed with XIST. Also, TSIX is not maternally imprinted in placental tissues, and its transcription persists in placental and fetal tissues, throughout embryogenesis. Therefore, the repression of Xist by mouse Tsix has no counterpart in humans, and TSIX is not the gene that protects the active X chromosome from random inactivation. Because human TSIX cannot imprint X inactivation in the placenta, it serves as a mutant for mouse Tsix, providing insights into features responsible for antisense activity in imprinted X inactivation.

ACMG technical standard — reporting for tumor cytogenomic testing specifies that the most recent edition of the International System for Human Cytogenetic Nomenclature (ISCN) and Human Genome Variation Society (HGVS) should be used to report the chromosomal, FISH, CMA, and sequencing results. Preliminary verbal reports may be appropriate for some cases and should be documented appropriately. If an aberration is suspected to be germline, analysis of uninvolved blood, buccal, or skin/tissue sample is recommended to clarify the germline vs somatic nature of the aberration so that genetic counseling may be recommended as appropriate. The final report(s) for tumor samples should contain the following information: patient identification using 2 unique identifiers; referring physician name; sample information (type, dates of collection and receipt, date of report); reason for referral or suspected diagnosis; ISCN or HGVS nomenclature as appropriate; cells analyzed (both normal and abnormal) when applicable. Narrative description of the aberrations observed should be included; the report should correlate the results of all assays performed on the same tissue, and the interpretation will correlate the genetic testing results with the histopathology report and patient-specific clinical information; discussion can include the clinical significance of the results for the diagnosis, prognosis, and/or therapeutic management of the patient with reference to current literature. References may be included to support the interpretation and to provide helpful information for the health care professional.

### Characterization of the human lineage-specific pericentric inversion that distinguishes human chromosome 1 from the homologous chromosomes of the great apes [^111eFgSi]. Human Genetics (2006). Low credibility.

The human and chimpanzee genomes are distinguishable in terms of ten gross karyotypic differences including nine pericentric inversions and a chromosomal fusion. Seven of these large pericentric inversions are chimpanzee-specific whereas two of them, involving human chromosomes 1 and 18, were fixed in the human lineage after the divergence of humans and chimpanzees. We have performed detailed molecular and computational characterization of the breakpoint regions of the human-specific inversion of chromosome 1. FISH analysis and sequence comparisons together revealed that the pericentromeric region of HSA 1 contains numerous segmental duplications that display a high degree of sequence similarity between both chromosomal arms. Detailed analysis of these regions has allowed us to refine the p-arm breakpoint region to a 154.2 kb interval at 1p11.2 and the q-arm breakpoint region to a 562.6 kb interval at 1q21.1. Both breakpoint regions contain human-specific segmental duplications arranged in inverted orientation. We therefore propose that the pericentric inversion of HSA 1 was mediated by intra-chromosomal non-homologous recombination between these highly homologous segmental duplications that had themselves arisen only recently in the human lineage by duplicative transposition.

### Structural polymorphism and diversity of human segmental duplications [^111QyW1h]. Nature Genetics (2025). High credibility.

Segmental duplications (SDs) contribute significantly to human disease, evolution and diversity but have been difficult to resolve at the sequence level. We present a population genetics survey of SDs by analyzing 170 human genome assemblies (from 85 samples representing 38 Africans and 47 non-Africans) in which the majority of autosomal SDs are fully resolved using long-read sequence assembly. Excluding the acrocentric short arms and sex chromosomes, we identify 173.2 Mb of duplicated sequence (47.4 Mb not present in the telomere-to-telomere reference) distinguishing fixed from structurally polymorphic events. We find that intrachromosomal SDs are among the most variable, with rare events mapping near their progenitor sequences. African genomes harbor significantly more intrachromosomal SDs and are more likely to have recently duplicated gene families with higher copy numbers than non-African samples. Comparison to a resource of 563 million full-length isoform sequencing reads identifies 201 novel, potentially protein-coding genes corresponding to these copy number polymorphic SDs.

### Refined human artificial chromosome vectors for gene therapy and animal transgenesis [^117Q7LJu]. Gene Therapy (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

Conventional gene transfer techniques using viruses, plasmids, P1 phage-derived artificial chromosomes (PACs), bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs) and yeast artificial chromosomes (YACs), can insert DNA randomly into the host genome, possibly causing cancer in humans and unpredicted expression in transgenic animals. Human artificial chromosomes (HACs) exhibit several important characteristics desired for an ideal gene delivery vector, including stable episomal maintenance, and the capacity to carry large genomic loci with their regulatory elements, thus allowing physiological regulation of the introduced gene in a manner similar to that of the native chromosome.HACs have been generated using either a 'top–down approach' (engineered chromosome), or a 'bottom–up' approach (de novo artificial chromosome). Although several groups have reported functional analyses in vitro using de novo HACs, several factors limit the application of de novo generated HACs as gene delivery vehicles. The most critical problem is their undefined structure and the unpredictable relationship between the input DNA and resultant HAC, especially in terms of their size and composition. On the other hand, several groups have reported the creation of engineered HACs by random segmentation or targeted telomere-associated chromosomal fragmentation in homologous recombination-proficient chicken DT40 cells. We previously developed HAC vectors from normal human chromosome 14 (hChr.14) or 21 (hChr.21) by the engineering approach, and named the products SC20-HAC and 21ΔqHAC/21ΔpqHAC. The SC20-HAC was transmittable through the germline and was rather stable in mice and cattle. Both 21ΔqHAC and 21ΔpqHAC were very stable in human cell lines. However, SC20-HAC and 21ΔqHAC/21ΔpqHAC contain several structurally undefined regions carrying many endogenous genes, which cause partial trisomy in cells propagating these HACs. This may affect physiological gene expression and normal development. Although these HACs showed significant potential for gene therapy and animal transgenesis, the ideal gene delivery vector should be structurally defined and should not contain endogenous genes from the original chromosome. In this study, we developed a novel HAC vector of known sequence containing no endogenous genes using the top–down approach. We also developed several gene insertion systems on the HAC for functional analysis of multiple genes, safe human gene therapy and efficient animal transgenesis.

### Addressing sex as a biological variable in preclinical models of lung disease: an official American Thoracic Society research statement [^111Aw98o]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Pluripotent stem cell models (ESCs/iPSCs) — sex and X chromosome inactivation (XCI) variability affect differentiation and disease modeling: When designing experiments using pluripotent stem cell model systems, such as ESCs or iPSCs, it is crucial to consider how donor sex can introduce variability in reprogramming, pluripotency, and differentiation, partly due to variable X chromosome dosage and silencing. Unlike mESCs, female human ESCs have been shown to exhibit variable XCI, with the majority of female hESCs in the undifferentiated state displaying one Xi with complete XCI, and the epigenetic and silenced state of the Xi can vary between lines or passages with time in culture, where XIST becomes irreversibly silenced and portions of the Xi become aberrantly reactivated. Reprogramming of mouse female somatic cells to generate miPSCs results in reactivation of Xi, whereas reprogramming human female somatic cells, such as FBs, does not reactivate Xi, with the majority of female hiPSCs retaining complete XCI with preservation of the same active Xa and inactive Xi as at the somatic cell of origin. Subsets of female hiPSCs/hESCs lacking XIST expression also lack H3K27me3 and H4K20me3 heterochromatic modifications on the Xi and exhibit aberrant X-linked gene expression; caution should be taken when using female pluripotent stem cell lines for regenerative medicine applications because some hiPSCs/hESCs lacking XIST expression exhibit phenotypes of reduced differentiation potential. A profiling study of 165 female hiPSC lines in the undifferentiated state found that there can be erosion of XCI in some lines with time in culture, resulting in line-to-line variation in the number of derepressed genes and their degree of biallelic expression, with derepression uncommon and nonrandom and favoring epigenetically variable genes prone to derepression in human tissues in vivo.

Pi typing has limited resolution and does not allow distinguishing all genetic variants in SERPINA1, whereas exon sequencing determines the sequence of nucleotides of the four coding regions (exons) constituting SERPINA1 and in one test determines all coding mutations present; HGVS nomenclature illustrates variant annotation with the Pi*Z example named c.1096G > A at DNA level and p.E342K at protein level in codon 342. Targeted genotype panels can identify the most common mutations but cannot identify all mutations with this methodology, and SERPINA1 is localized on chromosome 14q32.13, is approximately 14 kb in length, and consists of 7 exons (labeled 1 A, 1B, 1 C, 2, 3, 4, 5) including 4 coding exons.

### Chromosome architecture and low cohesion bias acrocentric chromosomes towards aneuploidy during mammalian meiosis [^1134wuMp]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Results

Acrocentric chromosomes missegregate more often than metacentric chromosomes in porcine oocytes

First, we aimed to determine if acrocentric chromosomes missegregate more frequently during oocyte meiosis than metacentric chromosomes. Studies in human oocytes are limited by sample scarcity. Although mouse oocytes are commonly used to study meiosis, the female western house mouse (Mus musculus) typically has only telocentric chromosomes, with their kinetochores located at the very end of the chromosome. Pigs ovulate multiple oocytes per cycle and have multiple offspring within a litter, whereas humans mostly ovulate one oocyte and have single offspring. Despite this difference, porcine oocyte meiosis resembles human oocyte meiosis, and like human oocytes, porcine oocytes have both acrocentric and metacentric chromosomes. In addition, porcine oocytes are easily obtained from abattoirs and are generally of a young age (obtained from gilts), which eliminates potential age-associated differences in error rates between chromosomes. Young porcine oocytes are expected to already show significant aneuploidy rates –. Thus, we used porcine oocytes to uncover potential differences between acrocentric and metacentric chromosomes during meiosis.

### Engineering structural variants to interrogate genome function [^113qu38c]. Nature Genetics (2024). High credibility.

Structural variation, such as deletions, duplications, inversions and complex rearrangements, can have profound effects on gene expression, genome stability, phenotypic diversity and disease susceptibility. Structural variants can encompass up to millions of bases and have the potential to rearrange substantial segments of the genome. They contribute considerably more to genetic diversity in human populations and have larger effects on phenotypic traits than point mutations. Until recently, our understanding of the effects of structural variants was driven mainly by studying naturally occurring variation. New genome-engineering tools capable of generating deletions, insertions, inversions and translocations, together with the discovery of new recombinases and advances in creating synthetic DNA constructs, now enable the design and generation of an extended range of structural variation. Here, we discuss these tools and examples of their application and highlight existing challenges that will need to be overcome to fully harness their potential.

### Addressing sex as a biological variable in preclinical models of lung disease: an official American Thoracic Society research statement [^116UiWwp]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Sex as a biological variable (SABV) in in vitro lung models — Cells derived from males and females differ in sex chromosomal complement and responses to environmental stimuli, growth factors, and disease, and the biological sex of cells plays a critical role in determining their phenotype and function. If cells are isolated from animals or humans, the donor's sex should be specified, and ideally, the sex of primary cells obtained from commercial sources should be confirmed. If the sex of the cells under study is unknown, assessing for the presence of X and Y chromosomes or X- and Y-chromosome–encoded genes (e.g. SRY) is an easy way of deciphering the sex of the cells under investigation. Variables such as isolation techniques, culture conditions, subculturing duration, and the timing of measurements can introduce variability that masks or amplifies sex-based differences, and prolonged passaging may also lead to cellular senescence and altered gene expression and (in the case of pluripotent stem cells) variable X chromosome inactivation or reactivation, thus differentially affecting male and female cells; carefully controlling these variables is crucial for accurately interpreting sex-based differences in in vitro studies. In human tissue–based translational models, the biological sex of the tissue donor must be considered, and incorporating SABV is equally important in complex 3D models like organoids and multicellular coculture systems; for instance, female-derived lung organoids may exhibit different repair mechanisms than male-derived counterparts, highlighting the need to include both sexes in lung disease modeling.

Genetic obesity-associated syndromes — Table 5 (continued) details key genetic abnormalities: Cohen syndrome is typically autosomal recessive with mutation of the vacuolar protein sorting 13 homolog B (VPS13B) gene, also known as the COH1 gene in chromosome 8 (8q22); Down syndrome features Trisomy 21 (three copies of chromosome 21); Fragile X syndrome involves mutation of Fragile X Messenger Ribonucleoprotein 1 (FMR1) gene; melanocortin 4 receptor (MC4R) deficiency is autosomal dominant, recessive, or codominant with polymorphism of the melanocortin 4 receptor (MC4R) gene localized to chromosome 18; Prader–Willi syndrome is not an inherited disease and is caused by random genetic error, with most cases involving loss of function of a portion of chromosome 15 (e.g., 15q11-13) and is often reported as the most common human genetic "obesity syndrome"; Turner syndrome involves absence or dysfunction of an X chromosome and affects females. Not all patients will have all these clinical findings.

### The use of chromosome-based vectors for animal transgenesis [^116MZZeS]. Gene Therapy (2002). Low credibility.

This article summarizes our efforts to use chromosome-based vectors for animal transgenesis, which may have a benefit for overcoming the size constraints of cloned transgenes in conventional techniques. Since the initial trial for introducing naturally occurring human chromosome fragments (hCFs) with large and complex immunogulobulin (Ig) loci into mice we have obtained several lines of trans-chromosomic (Tc) mice with transmittable hCFs. As expected the normal tissue-specific expression of introduced human genes was reproduced in them by inclusion of essential remote regulatory elements. Recent development of 'chromosome cloning' technique that enable construction of human artificial chromosomes (HACs) containing a defined chromosomal region should prevent the introduction of additional genes other than genes of interest and thus enhance the utility of chromosome vector system. Using this technique a panel of HACs harboring inserts ranging in size from 1.5 to 10 Mb from three human chromosomes (hChr2, 7, 22) has been constructed. Tc animals containing the HACs may be valuable not only as a powerful tool for functional genomics but also as an in vivo model to study therapeutic gene delivery by HACs.

### Molecular characterization of the pericentric inversion that causes differences between chimpanzee chromosome 19 and human chromosome 17 [^111tgjsJ]. American Journal of Human Genetics (2002). Low credibility.

A comparison of the human genome with that of the chimpanzee is an attractive approach to attempts to understand the specificity of a certain phenotype's development. The two karyotypes differ by one chromosome fusion, nine pericentric inversions, and various additions of heterochromatin to chromosomal telomeres. Only the fusion, which gave rise to human chromosome 2, has been characterized at the sequence level. During the present study, we investigated the pericentric inversion by which chimpanzee chromosome 19 differs from human chromosome 17. Fluorescence in situ hybridization was used to identify breakpoint-spanning bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs) and plasmid artificial chromosomes (PACs). By sequencing the junction fragments, we localized breakpoints in intergenic regions rich in repetitive elements. Our findings suggest that repeat-mediated nonhomologous recombination has facilitated inversion formation. No addition or deletion of any sequence element was detected at the breakpoints or in the surrounding sequences. Next to the break, at a distance of 10.2–39.1 kb, the following genes were found: NGFR and NXPH3 (on human chromosome 17q21.3) and GUC2D and ALOX15B (on human chromosome 17p13). The inversion affects neither the genomic structure nor the gene-activity state with regard to replication timing of these genes.

Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) probe interpretation — dual-fusion and break-apart probes — requires that "a good understanding of the design of all FISH probe results" be applied, with dual-fusion probe gene and flank coverage that "should be taken into consideration" and break-apart probes where "a clear distinction should be made between probes that span the 5' and 3' regions of the gene vs probes that span the flanking regions", correlating gene fusion (eg, KMT2A) versus dysregulation (eg, MYC); variant patterns should be interpreted in clinical-pathologic context, and "Metaphase FISH analysis is often required to characterize variant chromosomal rearrangements", with documentation per "Section E9".

### Engineering human tumour-associated chromosomal translocations with the RNA-guided CRISPR-cas9 system [^115475eH]. Nature Communications (2014). Medium credibility.

Cancer-related human chromosomal translocations are generated through the illegitimate joining of two non-homologous chromosomes affected by double-strand breaks (DSB). Effective methodologies to reproduce precise reciprocal tumour-associated chromosomal translocations are required to gain insight into the initiation of leukaemia and sarcomas. Here we present a strategy for generating cancer-related human chromosomal translocations in vitro based on the ability of the RNA-guided CRISPR-Cas9 system to induce DSBs at defined positions. Using this approach we generate human cell lines and primary cells bearing chromosomal translocations resembling those described in acute myeloid leukaemia and Ewing's sarcoma at high frequencies. FISH and molecular analysis at the mRNA and protein levels of the fusion genes involved in these engineered cells reveal the reliability and accuracy of the CRISPR-Cas9 approach, providing a powerful tool for cancer studies.

### Macrotene chromosomes provide insights to a new mechanism of high-order gene amplification in eukaryotes [^114MtKzH]. Nature Communications (2015). Medium credibility.

Understanding the molecular mechanisms at the basis of genome maintenance and dynamics is not only a fascinating question of biological evolution but it also bears great potential interest for the prevention or the cure of major genetic diseases in humans. Remarkable progress along these lines were recently made possible by the application of whole-genome sequencing techniques to analyse evolutionary experiments on unicellular organismsor to characterize human cancer cells. Next to Escherichia coli, on which experimental evolution was pioneered in Bacteria, the baker's yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae offers equivalent advantages for eukaryotes. The rate of nucleotidic mutation was determined over its entire genome under normal growth conditionsand the mutational landscape of some mutator strains has been characterized. Evolutionary experiments aimed at studying adaptation to controlled selective pressuresor the recovery from artificial gene dosage imbalancerevealed the frequent formation in this genome of low-order segmental amplifications (mostly two times, rarely up to four or five times), in addition to the more classical point mutations in genes or their regulatory elements. These amplifications exhibit a variety of topological forms such as intra- or inter-chromosomal segmental duplications, ranging in size from a fewto hundreds of kilobases, or supernumerary chromosomes (neochromosomes), made of two large segmental duplications joined together. Episomes were also reported, propagating short chromosomal segments in independent circularor linear forms.

These experimentally generated structures show variable levels of instabilityand tend to disappear over successive generations when the original selective factor is eliminated. Yet, segmental duplications are prone to play a prominent role in modelling genomes over large evolutionary timescales, and traces of intra- and interchromosomal segmental duplications are observed in natural genomes of a variety of eukaryotic organisms, including human where they may occasionally have pathogenic consequences. In natural yeast isolates, such traces are generally scarce, except in subtelomeric regions. But, in the original collection of yeast deletion mutants, large segmental duplications and whole-chromosome aneuploidy were frequently observed with, for some of them, demonstrated phenotypic effects. Such structures may also represent transient evolutionary solutions for long-term adaptation to stressful environmental conditions. Several mechanisms have been invoked at the origin of these temporary low-order amplification structures, including non-allelic homologous recombination between dispersed repeated sequences made of transposable elements or their remnants, micro-homology-mediated repair of accidentally broken replication forksand interference between adjacent replication origins. Replication stress and loss of replication control are potent inducers of these mechanisms.

### Opportunities and challenges associated with clinical diagnostic genome sequencing: a report of the Association for Molecular Pathology [^114UPgeX]. The Journal of Molecular Diagnostics (2012). Medium credibility.

Genome, exome, and gene panel sequencing coverage — Coverage is defined as the number of reads aligning to a reference region, and for the human haploid genome, which is approximately three billion bases, most investigators aim for 30- to 40-fold average coverage. For exome sequencing, the capture target varies from 30 to 50 Mb and typical average exon coverage would be 50- to 100-fold. Gene panel target sizes vary by the number of genes, with average coverage in the same range as for exome sequencing when analyzing constitutional variants. The page emphasizes balancing increased coverage for variant detection against sequencing costs, notes that lower genome coverage can miss variants observed in exome results from the same individual, highlights that panels achieve high coverage in defined targets, and cautions that adding new genes to a panel typically requires a redesign.

Common complex disorders risk alleles — Unlike Mendelian diseases, the identification of common, complex disease genes has largely relied on population-based approaches such as genome-wide association studies. Currently, numerous genome-wide association study reports have resulted in the cataloguing of over 1,200 risk alleles for common, complex diseases and traits, and most of these variants are in noncoding regions. Common, complex risk alleles typically confer low relative risk and are meager in their predictive power, and to date the utility of common, complex risk allele testing for patient care has been unclear, with models to combine multiple markers into a cumulative risk score often flawed and usually no better than traditional risk factors such as family.

### The complete sequence and comparative analysis of ape sex chromosomes [^114HzuVV]. Nature (2024). Excellent credibility.

Mapping short reads from multiple non-human ape individuals revealed intriguing patterns of diversity and highlighted the critical need for collecting additional samples. Further intraspecific studies, comparing the complete sex chromosomes of multiple individuals per species (as was recently done for the human Y chromosome) and subspecies are required to reveal the full landscape of ape sex chromosome evolution. Such studies will be useful for investigating sex-specific dispersal and will greatly inform conservation efforts in non-human ape species, all of which are endangered. In humans, both sex chromosomes are important for reproduction, genes on the X chromosome are also critical for cognition, abnormal X chromosome gene dosage underlies female bias in autoimmune disorders, and X-linked mutations are responsible for 10% of Mendelian disorders, even though the X chromosome constitutes only around 5% of the genome. Thus, we expect these T2T assemblies to be pivotal for understanding disease-causing mutations and human-specific traits.

American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and Society for Maternal–Fetal Medicine — prenatal chromosomal microarray analysis: Chromosomal microarray analysis is a method of measuring gains and losses of DNA throughout the human genome and can identify chromosomal aneuploidy, other large structural changes, and submicroscopic abnormalities too small for traditional modalities. Prenatal chromosomal microarray analysis is recommended for a patient with a fetus with one or more major structural abnormalities identified on ultrasonographic examination and who is undergoing invasive prenatal diagnosis, and this test typically can replace the need for fetal karyotype. Because most genetic changes detected by microarray that are not identified on standard karyotype are not associated with increasing maternal age, the use of this test can be considered for all women, regardless of age, who undergo prenatal diagnostic testing.

Heart Rhythm (2011). Medium credibility.

Appendix 1 glossary — key genetic testing terms are defined for clinical use: Autosomal dominant is the situation in which the disease can be expressed even when just one chromosome harbors the mutation, whereas autosomal recessive is expression only when both chromosomes of a pair are abnormal. Cascade testing is a procedure whereby all first-degree relatives of a genotype-positive index case are tested in concentric circles of relatedness, and if one relative is genotype positive, all his/her first-degree relatives should be tested continuing this process. Copy number variation (CNV) is when the number of copies of a gene or other DNA sequence differs between individuals. Expressivity is the level of expression of the phenotype, and variable expressivity occurs when manifestations differ among individuals with the same genotype. Penetrance is the likelihood that a gene mutation will have any expression at all, and if the frequency of expression is less than 100%, the defect is associated with reduced or incomplete penetrance. A first-degree relative is a blood relative who is a person's parent, sibling, or child; a founder mutation is the occurrence of a particular gene mutation at increased frequencies within a population due to a small ancestral group; the index case/proband is the person who first draws clinical attention in a family. Germline mutation denotes a heritable change incorporated into every cell in the body, whereas somatic mutations occur in cells other than gametes and cannot be transmitted to offspring.

### High-resolution genome-wide functional dissection of transcriptional regulatory regions and nucleotides in human [^116gp44P]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

We constructed a HiDRA library with 9.7 million total unique mapping fragments, of which 4 million had a frequency greater than 0.1 reads per million (RPM; non-mitochondrial reads). More than 99% of fragments had lengths between 169 nt and 477 nt (median: 337 nt), with the fragment length distribution showing two peaks spaced by ~147 nt, corresponding to the length of DNA wrapped around each nucleosome (blue bars, Fig. 1b). In contrast to unbiased fragmentation of the genome, our library has much higher efficiency for selectively targeting accessible DNA regions that are more likely to play gene-regulatory roles. Our HiDRA library covers 4486 predicted enhancers and 9631 predicted promoters ("Active Transcription Start Site (TSS)" state,) with more than 10 unique fragments (Fig. 1c, colored lines), a ~130-fold and ~210-fold enrichment compared with 35 enhancer and 46 promoter regions expected to be covered by chance at the same coverage. This indicates that HiDRA library construction successfully targets predicted regulatory regions rather than randomly fragmenting the genome. Even among enhancer and promoter regions and ATAC-seq peaks, those with higher expected activity are preferentially selected by HiDRA, as they show higher accessibility and are thus more likely to be cloned in our library and tested by our episomal reporters (Supplementary Fig. 1).

Our cloning strategy is specifically designed to densely sample regulatory regions, in order to enable high-resolution inference of regulatory activity from highly overlapping fragments. Indeed, we found up to 370 unique fragments per region in our HiDRA libraries, with ~32,000 genomic intervals containing at least 10 overlapping fragments ("tiled regions", green bars, Fig. 1b) and ~2750 containing at least 50 fragments, compared with 180 and 0 that would be expected by randomly selected fragments, respectively. In addition to clustering of tested fragments within the same region, high-resolution inference relies on partially-overlapping rather than fully-overlapping fragments, which requires a random fragmentation pattern. Indeed, the Tn5 transposase we used here inserts randomly into the genome, and indeed the resulting DNA fragments provide a dense sampling of start and end positions that mirrors the peaks of ATAC-seq experiments (Fig. 1d), indicating that accessible regions most likely to show regulatory activity will have both higher representation in our libraries, and also more starting and ending positions that can help identify driver nucleotides.

### AAN position statement: ethical issues in clinical research in neurology [^117Ew2RJ]. Neurology (2020). High credibility.

AAN position statement — human gene editing risks and consent: When applied to human somatic or germ cells, gene editing also introduces the additional risk of unintended consequences to individual participants through imperfectly understood genotype–phenotype interactions, or through off-target mutations in which the new genetic sequence is accidentally inserted in an incorrect location. In addition, genetic modifications of germ cells may violate the requirements of informed consent since affected future generations would have no choice about participation in the study. For these reasons, the AAN endorses a moratorium on human germline editing until the research community establishes a better understanding of the risks entailed, and until a framework for international oversight and regulation is established.
