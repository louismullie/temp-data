## Question

Histamine and anxiety

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the relationship between histamine and anxiety. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the central histaminergic system and its neuroanatomy. Then, I should verify direct causal evidence linking histamine signaling to anxiety behaviors. Next, I will examine indirect clinical associations, including allergy, mast cells, and the gut–brain axis. After that, I need to review pharmacologic data on antihistamines and multi-target agents. Finally, I will integrate mechanisms, consider limitations, and outline practical clinical implications and research gaps, making sure I double-check key claims against the cited literature as I go.

> Let me first confirm the neuroanatomy and physiology of the central histaminergic system, because mechanistic plausibility matters here. Histaminergic neurons are concentrated in the tuberomammillary nucleus of the posterior hypothalamus and project widely to cortex, limbic structures, and brainstem, with four GPCRs (H1–H4) mediating diverse neuromodulatory effects including arousal, cognition, and stress responses, which provides a biologically credible substrate for anxiety modulation [^45d9df6a] [^f62d7c60].

> Wait, let me verify direct causal evidence in animals before inferring human relevance. In rats, histamine infusion into the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) produces anxiogenic effects, and blockade of H1 or H2 receptors in the BNST ameliorates stress-induced anxiety without altering baseline anxiety, indicating a stress-gated mechanism rather than tonic anxiogenesis; similarly, intra-ventral hippocampal histamine is anxiogenic in the elevated plus maze, and this effect interacts with opioid withdrawal states, reinforcing a causal role for histamine in anxiety circuits [^eb858a14] [^410ebde1].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about directionality; I should double-check receptor-specific effects. H3 antagonists/inverse agonists increase histamine release and have been reported to reduce anxiety in some models, whereas H1/H2 blockade in the BNST reduces stress-induced anxiety, suggesting that different histamine receptors and circuit contexts yield opposing behavioral outcomes; this complexity means I need to be cautious about blanket statements that "histamine increases anxiety" without specifying receptor, brain region, and stress state [^4b1afd5f] [^eb858a14].

> Next, I should review indirect clinical associations that, while not proving causality, strengthen the hypothesis. Population data link physician-diagnosed allergies with higher odds of anxiety disorders, and importantly, allergy treatment attenuates this association, implying that histamine-driven allergic inflammation may contribute to anxiety risk; mechanistically, stress can activate mast cells and eosinophils, releasing histamine and CRH, which can increase intestinal permeability and engage neuroimmune pathways implicated in anxiety [^e2d0667e] [^aa0bb516] [^5f00a16a].

> I need to check the gut–brain axis angle, because peripheral histamine may modulate central states. The gut microbiome includes numerous histamine-producing bacteria, and higher baseline microbial histamine synthesis has been associated with future cognitive decline and depressive symptoms in older adults; in functional GI disorders, mast cell activation and low-grade inflammation are common, and histamine antagonists like mirtazapine can improve dyspepsia and anxiety, supporting a plausible gut–histamine–brain pathway [^607b8c2d] [^aa0bb516] [^a4182cd3].

> Let me consider pharmacologic evidence in humans, but I should confirm the quality and limitations. Hydroxyzine, a first-generation antihistamine with H1 blockade and sedative properties, has FDA labeling for anxiety and shows short-term efficacy in GAD trials, yet a Cochrane review concludes that evidence quality is limited by bias and small samples, so it is not a reliable first-line option; nonetheless, its clinical utility for acute anxiety, especially with comorbid insomnia or pruritus, remains plausible in select cases [^429bf1da] [^51e5ef46] [^bae4e8cc].

> But wait, what if antihistamines worsen anxiety via nonspecific effects; I should double-check that. Sedation and anticholinergic burden can impair cognition and paradoxically worsen anxiety in some patients, and diphenhydramine has been specifically discouraged for routine use due to safety concerns; thus, if histamine blockade is used clinically, agents with cleaner profiles and lower anticholinergic load may be preferable, and expectations should be tempered by modest effect sizes and limited long-term data [^e82fd492] [^51e5ef46].

> I will now examine multi-target drugs that include histamine receptor modulation, because they may illuminate receptor-specific contributions. Mirtazapine's H1 antagonism contributes to sedation and may benefit patients with anxiety and insomnia, and vortioxetine's multimodal serotonergic profile includes indirect modulation of histamine and other systems, with evidence of anxiolytic benefit in MDD with comorbid anxiety; these data suggest that histamine blockade can be clinically meaningful when embedded in broader neurotransmitter modulation, though attribution to H1 alone is not straightforward [^279126f4] [^8f5859e7] [^4a87e636].

> Let me synthesize mechanisms, but I should confirm each link against the literature. Histamine can directly excite stress nodes such as PVN CRH neurons, modulate BNST function, and alter hippocampal excitability; peripherally, mast cell histamine release can increase gut permeability, engage neuroimmune signaling, and alter vagal afferent traffic, while microbial histamine may contribute to neuroinflammation; clinically, antihistamines and multi-target agents with H1 blockade can reduce anxiety symptoms in selected contexts, though effect sizes and durability vary and are often modest [^4e8a1922] [^eb858a14] [^aa0bb516] [^607b8c2d] [^51e5ef46].

> Hold on, I should verify limitations and avoid overstatement. Much of the causal evidence is preclinical, receptor effects are region- and context-dependent, and human data are heterogeneous and often low quality; allergy treatment reducing anxiety could reflect improved sleep, reduced inflammatory burden, or placebo effects rather than direct histamine antagonism; thus, histamine appears to be a modifiable contributor in a subset of patients, but it is not a universal driver of anxiety and should not replace established anxiety treatments [^e2d0667e] [^51e5ef46].

> Next, I should review practical clinical implications, keeping risks and benefits in mind. For patients with prominent anxiety plus allergic disease, pruritus, or insomnia, a cautious trial of a sedating antihistamine such as hydroxyzine may be reasonable short term, with monitoring for sedation, anticholinergic effects, and QT risk; for patients with functional GI symptoms and anxiety, mirtazapine can address multiple targets including H1, 5-HT2, and α2, potentially improving anxiety, sleep, and GI symptoms; in all cases, prioritize SSRIs/SNRIs, buspirone, or CBT as first-line for anxiety, reserving histamine-modulating strategies as adjuncts or when comorbidities align [^429bf1da] [^a4182cd3] [^8de96d08].

> I should double-check special populations and safety. In older adults, anticholinergic antihistamines increase risks of delirium and falls, so second-generation antihistamines or non-antihistaminic strategies are preferred; in patients with prolonged QT or arrhythmia risk, avoid QT-prolonging agents like hydroxyzine; in Parkinson disease, mirtazapine is often favored for depression with insomnia, but avoid if REM behavior disorder is present; these nuances reinforce the need for individualized risk–benefit assessment [^e82fd492] [^429bf1da] [^279126f4].

> Finally, I need to ensure I identify research gaps and future directions. Prospective studies should test whether stratifying patients by peripheral histamine load, mast cell activation, or microbial histamine synthesis predicts response to H1/H2 blockade or H3 modulators; trials comparing antihistamines with active comparators and measuring inflammatory biomarkers, sleep, and interoception are needed; and mechanistic work should clarify which brain regions and receptor subtypes mediate anxiogenic versus anxiolytic effects of histamine in humans, so we can move toward precision targeting rather than broad sedation [^f4fe3006] [^eb858a14] [^607b8c2d].

Histamine is a key neurotransmitter in anxiety circuits, with **H1 receptor activation** in the BNST and hippocampus driving anxiogenic effects [^eb858a14] [^410ebde1], while **H3 antagonism** can reduce anxiety by increasing histamine release and modulating downstream neurotransmitters [^4b1afd5f]. Clinically, **hydroxyzine** is effective for acute anxiety but is limited by sedation and lack of long-term data [^51e5ef46] [^f8971000], and **mirtazapine** may help anxiety with comorbid insomnia or GI symptoms via H1 blockade [^279126f4] [^a4182cd3]. Emerging evidence links **gut microbiome histamine** to anxiety, suggesting new therapeutic targets [^607b8c2d] [^50fc3b0e].

---

## Central histaminergic system and anxiety

- **Histaminergic neurons**: Originate in the tuberomammillary nucleus and project widely, including to anxiety-related regions (BNST, hippocampus, amygdala, prefrontal cortex) [^45d9df6a] [^eb858a14].

- **H1 receptors**: Activation in BNST and hippocampus increases anxiety-like behavior in animals; H1/H2 blockade in BNST reduces stress-induced anxiety [^eb858a14] [^410ebde1].

- **H3 receptors**: Presynaptic autoreceptors that inhibit histamine release; H3 antagonists increase histamine release and can reduce anxiety in preclinical models [^4b1afd5f] [^a72d70e5].

---

## Peripheral histamine and anxiety

Peripheral histamine, released primarily by mast cells, can influence anxiety via the **gut–brain axis** and immune signaling. Mast cell activation increases intestinal permeability and promotes neuroinflammation, which can modulate anxiety [^aa0bb516]. The gut microbiome produces histamine, and higher microbial histamine synthesis has been linked to future depressive symptoms and anxiety, indicating a **microbiome–gut–brain axis** role [^607b8c2d] [^51c95e45].

## Clinical evidence: antihistamines and anxiety

| **Medication** | **Mechanism** | **Clinical evidence** | **Limitations** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Hydroxyzine | H1 antagonist | Effective for acute anxiety; rapid onset (15–30 min) [^6bb1ba9a] [^bae4e8cc] | Sedation; no long-term efficacy data [^51e5ef46] [^f8971000] |
| Mirtazapine | H1 antagonist | Anxiolytic in comorbid insomnia/GI symptoms; improves sleep [^279126f4] [^a4182cd3] | Weight gain; sedation |
| H3 antagonists | Increase histamine release | Anxiolytic in preclinical models [^4b1afd5f] [^a72d70e5] | Limited human data |

---

## Histamine and anxiety: clinical implications

- **Acute anxiety**: Hydroxyzine is a reasonable short-term option, especially with insomnia or pruritus [^f8971000] [^6bb1ba9a].

- **Chronic anxiety**: SSRIs/SNRIs remain first-line; mirtazapine is an alternative when insomnia or GI symptoms are present [^8de96d08] [^279126f4].

- **Personalized medicine**: Biomarkers (e.g. H1 expression, microbiome histamine) may guide therapy, but evidence is preliminary [^f4fe3006] [^607b8c2d].

---

## Limitations and future directions

- **Human data**: Limited; more RCTs are needed to define the role of histamine-targeted therapies [^51e5ef46].

- **Receptor specificity**: H1 vs H3 effects differ; selective agents may improve efficacy and tolerability [^eb858a14] [^4b1afd5f].

- **Gut–brain axis**: Microbiome modulation is promising but requires validation [^607b8c2d] [^51c95e45].

---

Histamine contributes to anxiety via **central H1 activation** and **peripheral immune–gut pathways**; H1 blockade (e.g. hydroxyzine, mirtazapine) can be clinically useful in selected patients, while H3 antagonism is a promising preclinical strategy.

### Stress and anxiety effects on positive skin test responses in young adults with allergic rhinitis [^29a6e688]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Anxiety and psychological stress affect allergy-related immune function. How these relations influence the evaluations of patients with allergic rhinitis is unknown.

Objective

To examine whether anxiety and stress exposure affect skin prick test (SPT) responses to common allergens for which patients with atopy showed no prior positive SPT response.

Methods

Patients with allergic rhinitis, evidenced by clinical history and SPT results, were admitted twice to a hospital research unit for 4 hours. In a crossover design, SPT wheals were assessed before and after the Trier Social Stress Test and then the following morning; for comparison, SPT wheals were assessed before and after a laboratory session without a stressor. Analyses focused on wheal responses for common allergens that tested negative (wheal size < 3 mm larger than saline) from SPTs performed at multiple baseline assessments.

Results

After the Trier Social Stress Test, more anxious patients with atopy had a higher incidence of positive SPT reactions to antigens that previously tested negative. Anxiety was unrelated to positive SPT incidence under nonstressful conditions. Based on clinical symptom reports, newly positive SPT reactions after the stressor were apparently corrections of previously false-negative SPT reactions. The SPT wheal responses for allergens previously testing negative were enhanced after a stressor. Histamine (positive control) or saline (negative control) SPT responses were not affected.

Conclusion

A laboratory stressor affected allergen SPT responses in more anxious patients with allergic rhinitis. In addition to clinical history, assessment of anxiety and current stress at the time of the SPT may provide valuable information about a patient's allergic status and aid in clinical decision making.

### Histamine signaling in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis modulates stress-induced anxiety [^eb858a14]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Anxiety disorder is one of the most prevalent psychiatric disorders. Intriguingly, dysfunction of the central histaminergic system, which is recognized as a general regulator for whole-brain activity, may result in anxiety, suggesting an involvement of the central histaminergic signaling in the modulation of anxiety. However, the neural mechanisms involved have not been fully identified.

Methods

Here, we examined the effect of histaminergic signaling in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) on anxiety-like behaviors both in normal and acute restraint stressed male rats by using anterograde tracing, immunofluorescence, qPCR, neuropharmacology, molecular manipulation and behavioral tests.

Results

We found that histaminergic neurons in the hypothalamus send direct projections to the BNST, which forms a part of the circuitry involved in stress and anxiety. Infusion of histamine into the BNST produced anxiogenic effect. Moreover, histamine H1 and H2 receptors are expressed and distributed in the BNST neurons. Blockade of histamine H1 or H2 receptors in the BNST did not affect anxiety-like behaviors in normal rats, but ameliorated anxiogenic effect induced by acute restraint stress. Furthermore, knockdown of H1 or H2 receptors in the BNST induced anxiolytic effect in acute restraint stressed rats, which confirmed the pharmacological results.

Limitations

A single dose of histamine receptor antagonist was used.

Conclusions

Together, these findings demonstrate a novel mechanism for the central histaminergic system in the regulation of anxiety, and suggest that inhibition of histamine receptors may be a useful strategy for treating anxiety disorder.

### Differentiation between the sensory and affective aspects of histamine-induced bronchoconstriction in asthma [^f4e28116]. Respiratory Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Respiratory symptom perception research has focused mainly on respiratory sensations. Because dyspnea is multidimensional, affective aspects should be investigated. Patients with asthma (N = 25) underwent a histamine provocation until a 20% fall in forced expiratory volume in 1s (FEV(1)). After each dose level, 6 symptoms of dyspnea intensity and 6 symptoms of dyspnea affectivity were rated. Individual perceptual sensitivity was determined by calculating the linear slope between the fall in FEV(1) and the increase in the total symptom score, and for affective and sensory symptoms separately [Bijl-Hofland, Folgering, van den Hoogen, et al. Perception of bronchoconstriction in asthma patients measured during histamine challenge test. Eur Respir J 1999;14:1049–54]. Trait anxiety, baseline state anxiety, daily asthma symptoms and catastrophizing during an asthma exacerbation were also assessed. Sensitivity was unrelated to physiological indices of disease severity (i.e., baseline FEV(1) and histamine dose level at 20% fall in FEV(1)), whereas it was positively related to trait anxiety, state anxiety, daily asthma symptoms and catastrophic thinking during an asthma exacerbation in daily life. These relationships were overall much stronger for affective than for sensory symptom slopes. In stepwise multiple regressions, state anxiety was the best predictor of the affective symptom slopes, whereas catastrophic thinking during an asthma exacerbation was the best predictor for the sensory symptom slopes. The differentiation between sensory and affective components of dyspnea adds to the understanding of respiratory symptom perception in asthma.

### Sixty years of conjecture over a urinary biomarker: a step closer to understanding the proposed link between anxiety and urinary pyrroles [^e82c862e]. Laboratory Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

TABLE 1.
Modified Ehrlich's analysis of urine samples from female volunteers with GAD-7 a

A cross-sectional analysis of pyrroles in psychiatric disorderssuggested that there is a correlation between histamine levels and pyrrole levels. Histamine itself is unlikely to react with Ehrlich's reagent as it does not have a free β-carbon. Clearly, more research is needed to confirm the identity of the Ehrlich's-positive compound and understand its potential value as a clinical biomarker. This is made difficult by the likely instability (stability data not presented) of kryptopyrrole when extracted from urine.

It has been suggested that stress-related gut permeability changes might account for stress-associated HPL in blood. This too is feasible, as bilirubin is excreted as a glucuronide conjugate in bile and gut microbiome β-glucuronidase releases the aglycone, which is normally further metabolized by the gut microbiome to stercobilin and eliminated in feces. Stercobilin (FIGURE 6) is likely to be in part further degraded by the gut microbiome. Interestingly, stercobilin has parts of its molecular makeup that have remarkable structural analogy to HPL and kryptopyrrole (compare FIGURES 1 and 6).

Figure 6.
Stercobilin: the two 3-ethyl-4-methyl-3,5-dihydropyrrol-2-one moieties at each end of the molecule have significant structural similarities to hydroxypyrrole (HPL) and kryptopyrrole (see FIGURE 1).

Furthermore, recent research has shown that stercobilin is absorbed from the gut in mice and that its presence in blood is linked to proinflammatory activity. Interestingly, peripheral proinflammatory cytokines (eg, interleukins) have been linked to generalized anxiety disorder in Chinese patients; this might furnish a link between leaky gut, stercobilin absorption, inflammatory response, and generalized anxiety disorder, which in turn presents a possible molecular association with alkylated pyrroles (perhaps derived from stercobilin).

If the Ehrlich's-positive compound in urine is kryptopyrrole, this might link its association with anxiety to a gut-mediated mechanism involving the biodegradation of stercobilin by the gut microbiome leading to a stercobilin-mediated inflammatory response.

### Gut microbiome predicts cognitive function and depressive symptoms in late life [^94ca30ad]. Molecular Psychiatry (2024). Medium credibility.

Gut microbiome predicts future cognitive function and depressive symptoms

Having established that gut microbiota is associated with current cognitive function, we next wanted to determine whether gut microbiota dynamics have predictive value for future cognitive function. Lower future cognitive function was associated with lower baseline cognitive function – a known predictor of future cognitive function. Surprisingly, lower future cognitive function was also associated with absence of hypertension. While some have reported a positive association between late life and hypertension and cognitive function, others argue that such relationship is minimal or negative. On taxonomic level, cognitive decline was associated with decreased relative abundance of Intestinibacter – a hallmark of gut dysbiosis suggesting inflammation-driven cognitive decline and increased biological aging. Functionally, cognitive decline was associated with lower baseline glutamate degradation and higher histamine synthesis potential. The association between lower glutamate degradation potential and future cognitive decline points to the role of the gut-brain axis in glutamate excitotoxicity leading to neurodegeneration. The association between increased bacterial histamine synthesis potential and future cognitive decline supports the hypothesis of neuroinflammatory-induced neurodegeneration in dementia.

Similarly, we confirmed features predictive of increased future depression, including higher baseline depression and anxiety, lower baseline cognitive function, and presence of diabetes mellitus. Future increase in depressive symptoms was also associated with lower relative abundance of Bacteroidota at baseline, a finding previously reported in mid-life depression. These findings point to the complex interactions between depression, anxiety, aging, and cognition, further emphasizing the need to treat late-life psychiatric symptoms. Interestingly, higher baseline Bacteroidota associated with lower baseline cognitive function, while lower baseline Bacteroidota also associated with future depression increase, emphasizing Bacteroidota is a large phylum with a variety of species that differently impact host health. Finally, increased future depression was associated with lower baseline glutamate degradation potential. In a recent investigation, modifications in microbial metabolites preceding the metabolic processes of glutamate and GABA have been established as having a direct correlation with depression. In this study, we validate and broaden the pivotal significance of microbial GABA and glutamate metabolism by elucidating that variations in both metabolic pathways are intricately linked to the manifestation of present and prospective depressive symptoms, respectively.

### Functional contrast across the gray-white matter boundary [^3a2627c1]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Relationship between GWFC and neurotransmitter receptors

Neurotransmitter receptor distribution maps, derived from a recently compiled multimodal atlas of the human brainwere used to investigate the neurochemical correlates of GWFC. 35 out of 48 neurotransmitter receptors show significant correlations with GWFC (p < 0.05, Bonferroni correction). Figure 5 shows the three neurotransmitter receptors that exhibit the highest positive correlation with GWFC distribution, serotonin 1 F, noradrenergic beta1, and histamine 2, as well as the three receptors with the highest negative correlation, serotonin 3a, 1a, and 7. These receptors are associated with a diverse range of physiological and cognitive functions. Specifically, serotonin 1 F is involved in pain and migraine modulation, noradrenergic beta1 plays a role in cardiac function regulation, and histamine 2 is linked to gastric acid secretion. In contrast, serotonin 3 A, is related to nausea and anxiety regulation, serotonin 1 A is associated with mood and anxiety regulation, and serotonin 7 contributes to circadian rhythms and mood regulation.

### Vestibular compensation: the neuro-otologist's best friend [^b78929d7]. Journal of Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

How to improve vestibular compensation?

The spontaneous recovery can be improved and/or accelerated, and it is not always optimal because patients can replace some lost vestibular functions (the VOR) by new maladaptive strategies (limitations of head movements). Therefore, it is important to probe the vestibular system, using the large battery of specific vestibular tests available along the compensation process. Two ways of VC improvement have been recently reviewed: the neuropharmacological approach, and the vestibular rehabilitation (VR) therapy.

Different neurotransmitters (glutamate, acetylcholine, GABA, glycine) and neuromodulators (histamine, adrenaline, noradrenaline) regulate the vestibular functions. Drugs up-regulating or down-regulating these transmitters or their receptors may therefore alter the time course of the recovery process and the final level of compensation as well. Vestibular dysfunction activates the stress axis. Steroids involved in the stress response modulate glutamatergic and GABAergic neurotransmission. Other hormones such as 17β-estradiol and 5α-dihydrotestosterone can induce LTP or LTD. Activation of the stress axis during VC is characterized by an up-regulation of arginine vasopressin-immunoreactive cells and corticotrophin-releasing factor-immunoreactive cells in the paraventricular nucleus, and an increase of dopamine-β-hydroxylase in the locus coeruleus of UVN cats. Elevated cortisol level is found in neuro-otological diagnoses and high AVP level in patients during an acute attack of Menière's disease. Cortisol and ACTH levels are positively correlated with the vestibular pathology, in Menière's disease patients and patients with vestibular schwannoma. The acute stress response is important in promoting compensatory synaptic and neuronal plasticity in the VN, but excessive stress can impair VC. Poorly compensated patients often suffer of anxiety and depression, the reason why it is important to reduce anxiety and stress with VR therapy or anxiolytics. Up-regulation of inflammatory and neurotrophic factors in the VN can constitute a favourable environment for VC. Histamine is also involved in the modulation of plasticity in the VN. It inhibits GABA release through the H3 hetero-receptors, is involved in the neuron-glia cross-talk, and modulates the release of inflammatory mediators by microglial cells. Histaminergic drugs can therefore accelerate the recovery process, whereas antihistamines drugs prescribed during the acute stage can substantially reduce the neurovegetative signs and vertigo.

### Hydroxyzine for generalised anxiety disorder [^51e5ef46]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) is a common chronic long-term psychiatric disorder, particularly frequent in primary care. There are several treatment options available, both non-pharmacological (i.e. cognitive behavioral therapy) and pharmacological. Among the pharmacological interventions, antidepressants, buspirone and benzodiazepines (BDZs) have been studied in GAD. Hydroxyzine is an anti-histamine medication which has been used in the treatment of anxiety.

Objectives

1. To determine the efficacy of hydroxyzine in comparison with placebo or any other active agent in alleviating the acute symptoms of GAD. 2. To review acceptability of treatment with hydroxyzine in comparison with placebo or any other active agent. 3. To investigate the adverse effects of hydroxyzine in comparison with other active agents.

Search Strategy

The Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group's controlled trial registers (CCDANCTR-Studies and CCDANCTR-References) were searched on 1 March 2010. The author team ran complementary searches on MEDLINE, CINAHL and PsycINFO and checked reference lists of included studies, previous systematic reviews and major textbooks of anxiety disorders. Personal communication with pharmaceutical companies and experts in the field was also undertaken.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials allocating patients with GAD to hydroxyzine versus placebo and/or any other anxiolytic agent.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently extracted data. Information extracted included study characteristics, participant characteristics, intervention details and outcome measures in terms of efficacy (such as the number of patients who responded to treatment or remitted), acceptability (the number of patients who failed to complete the study) and tolerability (side effect profile).

Main Results

The search yielded 39 studies. We included five studies in the review with a total of 884 participants. We excluded 31 studies and designated three as awaiting assessment. The data from the included studies provide some evidence that hydroxyzine is more effective than placebo for GAD (odds ratio (OR) 0.30, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.58) and that it is also acceptable/tolerable (OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.58) (OR 1.49, 95% CI 0.92 to 2.40). Compared to other anxiolytic agents (benzodiazepines and buspirone), hydroxyzine was equivalent in terms of efficacy, acceptability and tolerability (hydroxyzine vs chloridiazepoxide: OR 0.75, 95% CI 0.35 to 1.62; hydroxyzine vs buspirone efficacy OR 0.76, 95% CI 0.40 to 1.42). In terms of side effects, hydroxyzine was associated with a higher rate of sleepiness/drowsiness than the active comparators (OR 1.74, 95% CI 0.86 to 3.53). There was, however, a high risk of bias in the included studies.

Authors' Conclusions

The included studies did not report on all the outcomes that were pre-specified in the protocol for this review. Even though more effective than placebo, due to the high risk of bias of the included studies, the small number of studies and the overall small sample size, it is not possible to recommend hydroxyzine as a reliable first-line treatment in GAD.

### Impact of allergy treatment on the association between allergies and mood and anxiety in a population sample [^e2d0667e]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Previous studies have suggested an association between allergy and mood and anxiety disorders. Yet, extant work suffers from methodological limitations.

Objective

To investigate the association between physician-diagnosed allergy and DSM-IV mood and anxiety disorders in the general population, and to examine the role of allergy treatment in this relationship.

Methods

Data were drawn from the German National Health Interview and Examination Survey, a population-based, representative sample of 4,181 adults aged 18–65 in Germany. Allergy was diagnosed by physicians during medical examination and mental disorders were diagnosed using the CIDI.

Results

Allergy was associated with an increased prevalence of any anxiety disorder [OR = 1.3 (1.1, 1.6)], panic attacks [OR = 1.6 (1.1, 2.1)], panic disorder [OR = 1.6 (1.01, 2.3)], GAD [OR = 1.8 (1.1, 3.0)], any mood disorder [OR = 1.4 (1.1, 1.7)], depression [OR = 1.4 (1.1, 1.7)] and bipolar disorder [OR = 2.0, (1.0, 3.8)]. After adjusting for desensitization treatment status, these relationships were no longer significant. Those treated for allergy were significantly less likely to have any mood or anxiety disorder [OR = 0.65 (0.4, 0.96)], compared to those untreated. All relationships were adjusted for age, gender and socioeconomic status (SES).

Conclusions & Clinical Relevance

These findings provide the first evidence of a link between physician-diagnosed allergy and DSM-IV mood and anxiety disorders in a representative sample. Treatment for allergy may mitigate much of this relationship.

### Hydroxyzine (hydroxyzine hydrochloride) [^f8971000]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

For symptomatic relief of anxiety and tension associated with psychoneurosis and as an adjunct in organic disease states in which anxiety is manifested.

Useful in the management of pruritus due to allergic conditions such as chronic urticaria and atopic and contact dermatoses and in histamine-mediated pruritus.

As a sedative when used as a premedication and following general anesthesia, hydroxyzine may potentiate meperidine and barbiturates, so their use in pre-anesthetic adjunctive therapy should be modified on an individual basis. Atropine and other belladonna alkaloids are not affected by the drug. Hydroxyzine is not known to interfere with the action of digitalis in any way and it may be used concurrently with this agent.

The effectiveness of hydroxyzine as an antianxiety agent for long term use, that is more than 4 months, has not been assessed by systematic clinical studies. The physician should reassess periodically the usefulness of the drug for the individual patient.

### Association between sleep quality and pain intensity in mild patients with COPD: a community study [^fe525b43]. Journal of Pain Research (2021). Medium credibility.

In addition to overall sleep quality assessed by total PSQI score, we also investigated the impact of pain on sleep efficiency, sleep quality and daytime disturbance respectively. No statistically significant association was observed between sleep efficiency/ quality and pain, which was consistent with some other studies. However, the relationship between shorter total sleep time and pain has been reported previously, and their association might be bidirectional. Use of sleep medication might contribute to reduce the interference from pain with sleep duration. However, due to the low proportion of use of sleep medication, we failed to examine their association. Patients in our study had low scores of SF-MPQ and low intensity of pain, which might be inadequate to interrupt the sleep and interfere with sleep latency. Like previous studies in elder adults and patients in other chronic conditions, we found that pain was associated with daytime dysfunction, such as daytime sleepiness, fatigue, and increased napping. However, PSQI merely contained two questions about daytime dysfunction. More detailed instruments and information about daytime dysfunction were necessary.

The biobehavioural mechanisms underlying the association between sleep and pain are not entirely clear. One hypothesis was related to inflammation. Previous studies found that both painand insomnia symptomswere significantly associated with higher levels of inflammation biomarkers. Lower sleep duration was proved to increase the level in blood of C-reactive protein (CRP), IL-6and TNF-α. These cytokines might result in histamine-induced vasodilation, causing the redness, swelling, pain, and warmth, which were characteristics of general pain. Moreover, it has been found that negative mood plays an possible medium adjusting role in the association between sleep and pain in non-clinically depressed people. Depression and anxiety are common comorbidities in patients with COPD as well, which may partially explain the association between sleep quality and pain in this population. However, in the present research, only 12.9% patients had anxiety/depression problems. After excluding those patients with anxiety/depression, the association between sleep and pain remained significant.

### Cognitive effects of allergic rhinitis and its treatment [^534908c8]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

Allergic rhinitis (AR) can, by itself, introduce significant sedation and impairment of cognition and performance. AR can also impede restorative sleep, resulting in increased fatigue and decreased daytime performance. It is not clear whether improved alertness resulting from blocking histamine production offsets the sedating effects of antihistamines or whether the effects of disease and treatment combine to create even greater sedation. This article reviews and integrates this literature, offers conclusions based on the collective evidence, and suggests guidelines for future research.

### Withdrawal from repeated administration of morphine alters histamine-induced anxiogenic effects produced by intra-ventral hippocampal microinjection [^410ebde1]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2010). Low credibility.

In the present study, the influence of withdrawal from repeated administration of morphine on intra-ventral hippocampal microinjection of histamine-induced anxiety-like behavior was investigated in male Wistar rats. Three days subcutaneous administration of morphine (5–10 mg/kg) followed by five days free of the drug decreased the percentage open arm time and the percentage open arm entries. Intra-ventral hippocampal administration of histamine (2.5–7.5 microg/rat) decreased percentage open arm time and percentage open arm entries. Intra-ventral hippocampal histamine-induced anxiogenic effect was reversed in animals that had previously received the three days morphine (7.5 mg/kg) followed by five days free of the drug. Intra-ventral hippocampal administration of pyrilamine (5–20 microg/rat) or ranitidine (10–40 microg/rat) decreased percentage open arm time and percentage open arm entries. Pyrilamine- or ranitidine-induced anxiogenic effect was not changed in animals that had previously received the three days morphine (7.5 mg/kg) followed by five days free of the drug. Intra-ventral hippocampal injections of clobenpropit increased percentage open arm time. The percentage open arm time and percentage open arm entries were decreased in the morphine-treated animals compared with non-morphine-treated controls. Percentage open arm entries and locomotor activity was reduced with some doses of clobenpropit. It can be concluded that the histamine system is involved in anxiety-like behavior, and repeated injections of morphine followed by five days free of the drugs interact with histamine receptor mechanism.

### Environmental risk factors, protective factors, and biomarkers for allergic rhinitis: a systematic umbrella review of the evidence [^01b78196]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Allergic rhinitis (AR) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the nasal mucosa, which is caused by the release of immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated mediators (mainly histamine) after allergic individuals are exposed to allergens, and a variety of immune active cells and cell factors are involved. In the USA, the prevalence of physician-diagnosed allergic rhinitis is about 15%, and patients self-report abnormal nasal symptoms up to 30%. A Danish study spanning three decades reported that the prevalence of allergic rhinitis in the Danish adult population in the last three decades increased from 16% in 1990–1991 to 29% in 2012–2015, and the prevalence of allergic rhinitis is likely to continue to increase in this century. It has been estimated that 1 in 6 individuals in the USA may have AR, generating $2 billion to $5 billion in direct medical expenditures annually and up to $2 billion to $4 billion in lost productivity due to lost work and attendance. Nasal symptoms, including nasal congestion, itchy nose, rhinorrhea (runny nose), and sneezing, are the signature symptoms of AR, and symptoms last or accumulate for more than 1 h per day. This long-term chronic nasal symptom may further lead to the decline of brain function, affect the quality of life of patients, reduce the efficiency of work and study in adults and children, and also lead to the patient's irritability, and even cause anxiety, depression, and other neuropsychiatric symptoms. It is estimated that about 40% of AR patients will be accompanied by bronchial asthma, and about 30–71% of AR patients will have allergic conjunctivitis or conjunctival symptoms.

### Allergic diseases and mental health [^e5d84cb6]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2024). Medium credibility.

Neuropsychiatric symptoms have long been acknowledged as a common comorbidity for individuals with allergic diseases. The proposed mechanisms for this relationship vary by disease and patient population and may include neuroinflammation and/or the consequent social implications of disease symptoms and management. We review connections between mental health and allergic rhinitis, atopic dermatitis, asthma, vocal cord dysfunction, urticaria, and food allergy. Many uncertainties remain and warrant further research, particularly with regard to how medications interact with pathophysiologic mechanisms of allergic disease in the neuroimmune axis. Proactive screening for mental health challenges, using tools such as the Patient Health Questionnaire and Generalized Anxiety Disorder screening instruments among others, can aid clinicians in identifying patients who may need further psychiatric evaluation and support. Although convenient, symptom screening tools are limited by variable sensitivity and specificity and therefore require healthcare professionals to remain vigilant for other mental health "red flags". Ultimately, understanding the connection between allergic disease and mental health empowers clinicians to both anticipate and serve the diverse physical and mental health needs of their patient populations.

### Differences in the risk of mood disorders in patients with asthma-COPD overlap and in patients with COPD alone: a nationwide population-based retrospective cohort study in Korea [^7c280c1d]. Respiratory Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Several studies have shown that patients with ACO have more severe respiratory symptoms, more frequent exacerbations and hospitalizations than those with COPD alone. In addition, COPD is treated mainly with bronchodilators, whereas ICS is recommended for the treatment of ACO patient with features of asthma. Therefore, patients with ACO are not only exposed to frequent use of systemic corticosteroids due to exacerbations, but they are also more treated with regular ICS, compared to those with COPD alone. Corticosteroids exposure leading to mood disorder can be explained by the fact that chronic corticosteroid use has been associated with alterations in central and peripheral serotonin levels. Further studies are needed to understand the mechanism behind the higher risk of mood disorder in patients with ACO compared to those with COPD.

Association between alcohol-related illness and higher incidence of depression in patients with ACO can be explained by a research that showed acetaldehyde causing bronchoconstriction indirectly via histamine-mediated process in asthma patients. Through the process of ethanol metabolism, mainly by aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH), ethanol is oxidized to acetaldehyde, which is further oxidized to acetate. However, many East Asian people were reported to be deficient in ALDH2, one of the ALDH isozymes. When they ingest ethanol, their blood acetaldehyde and histamine levels increase significantly due to insufficient metabolic activity, and the increased histamine may result in bronchoconstriction. Therefore, alcohol-related illnesses in ACO patients may cause more frequent exacerbations and lead to increased risk of depression. However, why the risk of anxiety was not affected by the presence of alcohol-related illness remains unexplained, and further studies are needed.

### Update on the evaluation and management of functional dyspepsia [^a712dd49]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Dyspepsia affects up to 40 percent of adults each year and is often diagnosed as functional (nonulcer) dyspepsia. The defining symptoms are postprandial fullness, early satiation, or epigastric pain or burning in the absence of causative structural disease. These symptoms may coexist with symptoms of functional gastrointestinal disorders, such as gastroesophageal reflux and irritable bowel syndrome, as well as anxiety and depression. The history and physical examination can help identify other possible causes of the symptoms. Warning signs of serious disease, such as cancer, are unintended weight loss, progressive dysphagia, persistent vomiting, evidence of gastrointestinal bleeding, and a family history of cancer. In these cases, more extensive laboratory investigation, imaging, and endoscopy should be considered as clinically indicated. During the initial evaluation, a test-and-treat strategy to identify and eradicate Helicobacter pylori infection is more effective than empiric treatment and more cost-effective than initial endoscopy. Eradication of H. pylori helps one out of 15 patients with functional dyspepsia diagnosed by endoscopy, but may not be cost-effective. Treatment options that may be beneficial for functional dyspepsia include histamine H2 blockers, proton pump inhibitors, and prokinetic agents. Although psychotropic medications and psychological interventions have no proven benefit in patients with functional dyspepsia, they are appropriate for treating common psychiatric comorbidities.

### Gut microbiome predicts cognitive function and depressive symptoms in late life [^607b8c2d]. Molecular Psychiatry (2024). Medium credibility.

Depression in older adults with cognitive impairment increases progression to dementia. Microbiota is associated with current mood and cognition, but the extent to which it predicts future symptoms is unknown. In this work, we identified microbial features that reflect current and predict future cognitive and depressive symptoms. Clinical assessments and stool samples were collected from 268 participants with varying cognitive and depressive symptoms. Seventy participants underwent 2-year follow-up. Microbial community diversity, structure, and composition were assessed using high-resolution 16S rRNA marker gene sequencing. We implemented linear regression to characterize the relationship between microbiome composition, current cognitive impairment, and depressive symptoms. We leveraged elastic net regression to discover features that reflect current or future cognitive function and depressive symptoms. Greater microbial community diversity associated with lower current cognition in the whole sample, and greater depression in participants not on antidepressants. Poor current cognitive function associated with lower relative abundance of Bifidobacterium, while greater GABA degradation associated with greater current depression severity. Future cognitive decline associated with lower cognitive function, lower relative abundance of Intestinibacter, lower glutamate degradation, and higher baseline histamine synthesis. Future increase in depressive symptoms associated with higher baseline depression and anxiety, lower cognitive function, diabetes, lower relative abundance of Bacteroidota, and lower glutamate degradation. Our results suggest cognitive dysfunction and depression are unique states with an overall biological effect detectable through gut microbiota. The microbiome may present a noninvasive readout and prognostic tool for cognitive and psychiatric states.

### Evaluation and management of nonulcer dyspepsia [^1c2a6998]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

When no organic cause for dyspepsia is found, the condition generally is considered to be functional, or idiopathic. Nonulcer dyspepsia can cause a variety of symptoms, including abdominal pain, bloating, nausea, and vomiting. Many patients with nonulcer dyspepsia have multiple somatic complaints, as well as symptoms of anxiety and depression. Extensive diagnostic testing is not recommended, except in patients with serious risk factors such as dysphagia, protracted vomiting, anorexia, melena, anemia, or a palpable mass. In these patients, endoscopy should be considered to exclude gastroesophageal reflux disease, peptic or duodenal ulcer, and gastric cancer. In patients without risk factors, consideration should be given to empiric therapy with a prokinetic agent (e.g., metoclopramide), an acid suppressant (histamine-H2 receptor antagonist), or an antimicrobial agent with activity against Helicobacter pylori. Treatment of patients with H. pylori infection and nonulcer dyspepsia (rather than peptic ulcer) is controversial and should be undertaken only when the pathogen has been identified. Psychotropic agents should be used in patients with comorbid anxiety or depression. Treatment of nonulcer dyspepsia can be challenging because of the need to balance medical management strategies with treatments for psychologic or functional disease.

### Neural correlates of IgE-mediated food allergy [^d870f960]. Journal of Neuroimmunology (2003). Low credibility.

Although many authors have considered the possibility of a direct interaction between food allergy and behavioral changes, the evidence supporting this hypothesis is elusive. Here, we show that after oral ovalbumin (OVA) challenge, allergic mice present higher levels of anxiety, increased Fos expression in emotionality-related brain areas, and aversion to OVA-containing solution. Moreover, treatment with anti-IgE antibody or induction of oral tolerance abrogate both food aversion and the expression of c-fos in the central nervous system (CNS). Our findings establish a direct relationship between brain function and food allergy, thus creating a solid ground for understanding the etiology of psychological disorders in allergic patients.

### Randomised controlled trial of mesalazine in IBS [^aa247a21]. Gut (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

IBS is the most common functional GI disorder in which abdominal pain and/or discomfort is associated with changes in bowel habit, and with features of disordered defecation. IBS affects 10–20% of the population and causes a marked reduction of quality of life in affected individuals. IBS is a heterogeneous disorder involving a combination of negative life experiences and trauma, particularly early in life, genetic predisposition and environmental factors. Patients with IBS show dysfunction in the brain–gut axis, including anxiety, depression, gut dysmotility and visceral hypersensitivity. The relative importance of central versus peripheral mechanism in the IBS pathophysiology remains poorly defined. Mounting evidence is showing microscopic and molecular abnormalities in large subsets of patients with IBS. The most compelling evidence linking inflammation to IBS is the demonstration of the development of IBS in 3.7–36.8% of subjects following acute infectious gastroenteritis. Mucosal and systemic immune activation have also been widely documented in patients with IBS in the absence of a previous major gastroenteritis event. Mucosal inflammation is linked to increased mucosal permeability, enterochromaffin cell hyperplasia and higher tissue availability of serotonin, a key factor involved in the control of gut sensorimotor functions. Another key finding linking inflammation to IBS pathophysiology and symptom generation is the observation that adoptive transfer of mucosal biopsy supernatants evoked activation of sensory pain pathwaysand abnormal enteric nervous system responses in recipient rodents. Interestingly, these responses were reduced to a large extent by antagonism of immune-related factors including proteases and histamine. The origin of low-grade inflammation in patients with IBS remains undetermined, but it is likely to be multifactorial, involving genetic predisposition, stress, atopy, abnormal intestinal microbiotaand higher mucosal permeability increasing antigenic exposure of the mucosa to luminal antigens.

### Light-responsive adipose-hypothalamus axis controls metabolic regulation [^f7e51434]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

The mechanism by which circulating histidine regulates metabolism remains unexplained. Recent studies using cryo-electron microscopy have resolved the structure of heterodimeric transporter LAT1/4F2hc, also known as the L-type amino acid transporter (LAT1). LAT1, which is expressed at a relatively high level on both the luminal and abluminal sides of the brain capillary endothelial cells as well as on brain parenchymal cells at the blood-brain-barrier (BBB), plays a role in the transport of essential amino acids, such as histidine, across the cell membrane. Thus, in our study, histidine released from scWAT in response to blue light, can enter the brain presumably through LAT1 at the BBB. In the brain, histidine is converted to histamine via the action of HDC, the key enzyme in histamine biosynthesis. HDC is expressed in histamine neurons in the hypothalamus, particularly within the posterior hypothalamus, where five distinct cell types of histaminergic neurons are clustered and innervated throughout the brain. The histaminergic neurons have been implicated in regulating sleep-wakefulness and arousal, suppressing food intake via histamine H1 receptors in the hypothalamus, and increasing energy expenditure by stimulating lipolysis in adipose tissue via SNS activation.

Fulop et al. generated the HDC-KO mice, which are deficient in producing histamine, and confirmed the lack of Hdc mRNA, histamine immunoreactivity, and histaminergic innervation throughout the brain. Aged (30-week-old) HDC-KO mice became obese, despite not being hyperphagic, and exhibited impaired glucose tolerance, hyperinsulinemia, and hyperleptinemia. They also displayed reduced Ucp1 mRNA expression in BAT, leading to impaired thermogenesis in response to cold. As an alternative way to impair HDC function, i.p. bolus FMH injection has been shown to block the histidine-induced increase of sympathetic activity in BAT of rats. In agreement with this reference, we demonstrate that i.p. injection of FMH decreased the number of the histaminergic neurons and HDC activity in the brain, including the hypothalamus. Furthermore, in a low L-histidine diet-induced mouse model, insufficient intake of histidine reduces the brain histamine concentrations and triggers anxiety-like behaviors. Taken together, the lack or reduction of HDC enzyme in the hypothalamus leads to attenuated BAT function, highlighting the role of histidine in the regulation of energy homeostasis.

### Label: HYDROXYZINE HYDROCHLORIDE tablet, film coated… [^6bb1ba9a]. FDA (DailyMed) (2024). Medium credibility.

Hydroxyzine is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and hydroxyzine's clinical effects are usually noted within 15 to 30 minutes after oral administration. INDICATIONS AND USAGE For symptomatic relief of anxiety and tension associated with psychoneurosis and as an adjunct in organic disease states in which anxiety is manifested. The effectiveness of hydroxyzine as an antianxiety agent for long term use, that is more than 4 months, has not been assessed by systematic clinical studies. The physician should reassess periodically the usefulness of the drug for the individual patient. CONTRAINDICATIONS Oral hydroxyzine hydrochloride is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to hydroxyzine hydrochloride products, and in patients with known hypersensitivity to cetirizine hydrochloride or levocetirizine hydrochloride. Hydroxyzine is contraindicated for patients who have shown a previous hypersensitivity to it.
- WARNINGS PRECAUTIONS THE POTENTIATING ACTION OF HYDROXYZINE MUST BE CONSIDERED WHEN THE DRUG IS USED IN CONJUNCTION WITH CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM DEPRESSANTS SUCH AS NARCOTICS, NON-NARCOTIC ANALGESICS AND BARBITURATES. Therefore, when central nervous system depressants are administered concomitantly with hydroxyzine their dosage should be reduced. Dry mouth. Central Nervous System Drowsiness is usually transitory and may disappear in a few days of continued therapy or upon reduction of dose. Involuntary motor activity including rare instances of tremor and convulsions have been reported, usually with doses considerably higher than those recommended. Clinically significant respiratory depression has not been reported at recommended doses. Cardiac System QT prolongation, Torsade de Pointes. In postmarketing experience, the following additional undesirable effects have been reported: Body as a Whole: Allergic reaction. Nervous System: Headache. Psychiatric: Hallucination.

### The histamine H3 receptor antagonist thioperamide rescues circadian rhythm and memory function in experimental parkinsonism [^319dfed3]. Translational Psychiatry (2017). Low credibility.

Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder, characterized by motor impairment and a wide range of non-motor symptoms, including sleep disorders and cognitive and affective deficits. In this study, we used a mouse model of PD based on 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) to examine the effect of thioperamide, a histamine H3 receptor antagonist, on circadian activity, recognition memory and anxiety. A partial, bilateral 6-OHDA lesion of the striatum reduces motor activity during the active phase of the 24h cycle. In addition, the lesion disrupts the endogenous circadian rhythm observed when mice are maintained in constant darkness. Administration of thioperamide to 6-OHDA-lesion mice rescues the normal rest/activity cycle. Moreover, thioperamide counteracts the deficit of novel object recognition produced by 6-OHDA. Our experiments show that this memory impairment is accompanied by disrupted gamma oscillations in the hippocampus, which are also rescued by thioperamide. In contrast, we do not observe any modification of the anxiogenic effect of 6-OHDA in response to administration of thioperamide. Our results indicate that thioperamide may act as a multifunctional drug, able to counteract disruptions of circadian rhythm and cognitive deficits associated with PD.

### Genome-wide analysis of 53, 400 people with irritable bowel syndrome highlights shared genetic pathways with mood and anxiety disorders [^4f61c9b7]. Nature Genetics (2021). High credibility.

Main

IBS is common worldwide and typically presents in early adulthood with symptoms including abdominal pain, bloating and bowel dysfunction. Symptom intensity varies over time and between individuals but IBS has been reported, in severe cases, to affect quality of life as much as renal impairment or diabetes.

IBS accounts for approximately half of all referrals to gastroenterology clinics. Although of doubtful clinical value, many patients undergo multiple investigations, including colonoscopies, to exclude conditions such as Crohn's disease or cancer. To the frustration of patients and clinicians alike, all tests are characteristically normal. The healthcare costs, combined with indirect employment costs, of IBS amount to at least €13 billion (£11.7 billion) annually in Europe.

Attempts have been made to identify positive clinical diagnostic features and reduce investigations. The widely used and recently revised Rome III criteria define IBS as unexplained abdominal pain or discomfort eased by defecation, with altered stool form or frequency, for more than six months. Three main subtypes are recognized: constipation-predominant (IBS-C), diarrhea-predominant (IBS-D) or 'mixed'/alternating constipation and diarrhea (IBS-M). Individuals with functional constipation and functional diarrhea share the disordered bowel pattern with IBS but do not suffer from pain.

The commonly used IBS treatments, ranging from dietary exclusion to psychoactive medications, are relatively ineffective and their variety reflects the uncertain etiology. Behavioral therapies, while more effective (number needed to treat = 4), are not widely available. Given the high frequency, impact and cost of IBS, there is a pressing need for improved pathophysiological understanding to enable better therapeutic approaches.

The relative importance of peripheral and gut versus central and psychological factors to IBS etiology is uncertain. The consensus view is that IBS results from abnormal brain–gut interactions. Recent epidemiological data suggested that, in individuals developing both IBS and psychological features, the former preceded the latter in two thirds of cases and the latter preceded the former in one third. IBS is associated with abnormalities of central pain processing but also increased gut permeability, mast cell activation, disordered motility and dysbiosis. Up to one in ten cases are triggered after infection, so-called postinfectious IBS (PI-IBS).

### Anxiety and food allergy: a review of the last two decades [^e0424ba6]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2020). Medium credibility.

Food allergy (FA) is recognized as a growing public health burden affecting 5%-10% of children worldwide. Several unique features specific to FA elicit high levels of emotional distress and anxiety in patients and caregivers, the first among all the possibility of a life-threatening reaction. Anxiety disorders are highly prevalent in patients with chronic disease, but remain undertreated despite significant negative consequences on patient health. This review aimed to offer a comprehensive overview of literature data on FA and anxiety of the last two decades. A review of the medical and psychological literature from the year 2000 (MEDLINE, PubMed and PsycINFO) was done using the keywords "anxiety" and "food allergy". Clinical implications for disease management, various manifestations in different target groups, proper interventions and possible explanations on the nature of the association between FA and anxiety have been discussed, as well as limitations and further research directions. The relationship between FA and anxiety is attributed to FA-specific fears and anxiety, rather than a general propensity towards anxiety. Some anxiety-short-lived and related to key events-is to be expected and may even be helpful if it sustains allergen avoidance and preparedness to emergency. However, some data reported that increased anxiety did not improve adherence. Rather, high levels of anxiety have been demonstrated counterproductive and related to maladaptive coping. Further research is needed to elucidate the association between FA and anxiety, especially to understand biopsychosocial directions of the underlying mechanisms and to build proper, effective, standardized protocols of intervention. Clinicians must be aware of the association between FA and anxiety, understand their role in recognizing maladaptive anxiety and encouraging to seek psychological support when needed.

### The histamine H3 receptor antagonist thioperamide rescues circadian rhythm and memory function in experimental parkinsonism [^4b1afd5f]. Translational Psychiatry (2017). Low credibility.

The present study shows that the impairment of long-term recognition memory observed in experimental parkinsonism is associated with degradation of hippocampal gamma oscillations. In the hippocampus, gamma oscillations have been proposed to support memory retrieval by coordinating the activities of the CA3 and CA1 regions. Gamma frequency activity in the hippocampus has also been correlated with successful encoding of long-term memory, and increased gamma oscillations are regarded as predictor of memory formation. These findings suggest that the loss of recognition memory in the mouse PD model may be caused by the parallel disruption of gamma oscillation in the CA3 region of the hippocampus. They also raise the possibility that the restoration of long-term recognition memory produced by thioperamide is at least in part mediated by its ability to rescue gamma oscillations.

The exact mechanism by which thioperamide reverts the deficit in hippocampal gamma oscillation caused by dopamine depletion remains to be elucidated. Thioperamide may re-establish gamma oscillations by blocking inhibitory heteroreceptors and modulating the release of neurotransmitters, including glutamate, acetylcholineand catecholamines, which directly or indirectly impact hippocampal circuits. Activation of H3Rs has been also suggested to inhibit dopamine D1 receptor-mediated responses. By antagonizing this negative regulation, thioperamide may promote dopamine transmission, thereby counteracting the effect of the partial 6-OHDA lesion.

Augmented histamine transmission, leading to activation of postsynaptic histamine H1 receptors, has been proposed to exert anxiogenic effects. In contrast with this possibility, Bahi et al. reported that administration of an H3R antagonist, which promotes histamine release, counteracts anxiety in naive mice. In the present study, thioperamide did not affect the anxious phenotype produced by partial dopamine depletion. This highlights the importance of utilizing appropriate animal models of disease when assessing the efficacy of therapeutic interventions for specific pathological conditions.

In conclusion, this study shows that H3R antagonists represent potential multifunctional drugs for the treatment of disturbances of rest/activity cycle and cognitive impairment associated with PD. These results also provide a further validation of a simple toxin-based mouse model for the identification of therapeutic approaches to the treatment of nonmotor symptoms in PD.

### Hydrocodone bitartrate (zohydro) [^5852d1b5]. FDA (2015). Low credibility.

Effects on the Cardiovascular System Hydrocodone may produce release of histamine with or without associated peripheral vasodilation. Manifestations of histamine release and/or peripheral vasodilation may include pruritus, flushing, red eyes, sweating, and/or orthostatic hypotension.

Effects on the Endocrine System Opioids may influence the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal or -gonadal axes. Some changes that can be seen include an increase in serum prolactin, and decreases in plasma cortisol and testosterone. Clinical signs and symptoms may manifest from these hormonal changes.

Effects on the Immune System In vitro and animal studies indicate that opioids have a variety of effects on immune functions, depending on the context in which they are used. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown.

Concentration — Efficacy Relationships The minimum effective plasma concentration of hydrocodone for analgesia varies widely among patients, especially among patients who have been previously treated with agonist opioids. As a result, individually titrate patients to achieve a balance between therapeutic and adverse effects. The minimum effective analgesic concentration of hydrocodone for any individual patient may increase over time due to an increase in pain, progression of disease, development of a new pain syndrome and/or potential development of analgesic tolerance.

Concentration — Adverse Experience Relationships There is a general relationship between increasing opioid plasma concentration and increasing frequency of adverse experiences such as nausea, vomiting, CNS effects, and respiratory depression.

The dose of ZOHYDRO ER must be individualized [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. The effective analgesic dose for some patients will be too high to be tolerated by other patients.

### Self-reported food-related gastrointestinal symptoms in IBS are common and associated with more severe symptoms and reduced quality of life [^3e37409d]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Objectives

Despite the fact that food and diet are central issues, that concern patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), the current understanding about the association between the intake of certain foods/food groups and the gastrointestinal (GI) symptom pattern, psychological symptoms, and quality of life is poor. The aim of this study was to determine which food groups and specific food items IBS patients report causing GI symptoms, and to investigate the association with GI and psychological symptoms and quality of life.

Methods

We included 197 IBS patients (mean age 35 (18–72) years; 142 female subjects) who completed a food questionnaire in which they specified symptoms from 56 different food items or food groups relevant to food intolerance/allergy. The patients also completed questionnaires to assess depression and general anxiety (Hospital Anxiety and Depression), GI-specific anxiety (Visceral Sensitivity Index), IBS symptoms (IBS-Severity Scoring System), somatic symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire-15), and quality of life (Irritable Bowel Syndrome Quality of Life Questionnaire).

Results

In all, 84% of the studied population reported symptoms related to at least one of the food items surveyed. Symptoms related to intake of food items with incompletely absorbed carbohydrates were noted in 138 (70%) patients; the most common were dairy products (49%), beans/lentils (36%), apple (28%), flour (24%), and plum (23%). Of these, 58% experienced GI symptoms from foods rich in biogenic amines, such as wine/beer (31%), salami (22%), and cheese (20%). Histamine-releasing foods, such as milk (43%), wine/beer (31%), and pork (21%), were also considered causes of symptoms in IBS patients. GI symptoms were also frequently reported after intake of fried and fatty foods (52%). With increasing IBS symptom severity, patients reported more food items responsible for their GI symptoms (P = 0.004), and this was also found in patients with more severe somatic symptoms (P < 0.0001). Women tended to report more food items causing symptoms than men (P = 0.06). A high number of food items causing GI symptoms was also associated with reduced quality of life and this was significant for the following domains: sleep (r = -0.25; P = 0.001), energy (r = -0.21; P = 0.005), food (r = -0.29; P < 0.001), social functioning (r = -0.23; P = 0.001), and physical status (r = -0.16; P < 0.05). However, the number of food items reported to provoke GI symptoms was unrelated to body mass index, age, IBS subtype, anxiety, depression, or GI-specific anxiety.

Conclusions

The majority of IBS patients believe that certain food items are important triggers of their GI symptoms. This is especially true for foods containing carbohydrates and fat, and also may be relevant for histamine-releasing food items and foods rich in biogenic amines. Self-reported food intolerance is associated with high symptom burden and reduced quality of life.

### Gut microbiome predicts cognitive function and depressive symptoms in late life [^6994ab25]. Molecular Psychiatry (2024). Medium credibility.

Fig. 2
Summary of findings.

A Lower current cognitive function is associated with lower education, no antidepressant use, higher relative levels of Bacteroidota, lower Bifidobacterium, lower BMI, and lower anxiety. Higher current depression is associated with antidepressant use, lower education, diabetes, higher anxiety, and higher GABA degradation. B Lower cognition after 2 years is associated with lower baseline cognition, lower baseline abundance of Intestinibacter, absence of hypertension, lower baseline glutamate degradation, and higher baseline histamine synthesis. Higher depression after 2 years is associated with higher baseline anxiety and depression, diabetes, lower baseline cognition, lower baseline Bacteroidota, and lower baseline glutamate degradation. This figure was created with BioRender.com.

We could predict current MADRS accurately with the phylum data with out-of-bag correlation coefficient r(268) = 0.67, permuted p -value < 0.0001, alpha = 0.3, lambda = 1.81; with the genus data with out-of-bag correlation coefficient r(268) = 0.66, permuted p -value < 0.0001, alpha = 0.1, lambda = 7.93; and with GBM data with out-of-bag correlation coefficient r(268) = 0.67, permuted p -value < 0.0001, alpha = 0.1, lambda = 7.93. Higher MADRS (greater depression severity) was associated with higher anxiety symptoms, antidepressant use, and lower cognitive functioning across all models (Table 5, Fig. 2A, Supplementary Table 5). On Phylum level, presence of Diabetes Mellitus associated with higher depressive symptoms. On Genus level, lower education associated with greater depression symptoms. On functional level, higher microbial gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA) degradation capability associated with higher depression severity.

### The histamine H3 receptor antagonist thioperamide rescues circadian rhythm and memory function in experimental parkinsonism [^a72d70e5]. Translational Psychiatry (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Nonmotor symptoms are an increasingly urgent problem for the therapy of Parkinson's disease (PD), a common neurodegenerative disorder typically characterized by tremor, rigidity and bradykinesia. Sleep disturbances and circadian rhythm dysfunction affect the vast majority of parkinsonian patients and are often manifested during the early phase of the disease. Psychiatric conditions, including affective and cognitive disorders, are also commonly associated with PD. These symptoms are not well characterized and their pharmacotherapy is less developed, prompting the need for the identification of more effective treatments.

Histamine receptors are expressed throughout the brain, where they participate in the regulation of basic homeostatic processes and multiple brain functions, including wakefulness, attention and cognition. Among the four histamine receptors, the H3 receptor (H3R) has received particular attention as a target for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases and sleep disorders. H3Rs are located presynaptically, where they reduce histamine synthesis and release. Because of their high constitutive activity, H3 autoreceptors are antagonized by inverse agonists, which promote histamine transmission by acting on the nerve terminals of tuberomammillary neurons. Administration of H3R antagonists has been shown to improve wakefulness in animal models of narcolepsy, and in narcoleptic patients. Moreover, these drugs have been shown to enhance cognitive performance and revert the memory loss caused by pharmacological blockade of cholinergic transmission in animal models.,

The effects of H3R inverse agonists on wakefulness and cognition are accompanied by enhanced cortical beta (10–30 Hz) and gamma (30–80 Hz) oscillations. In line with this observation, it has also been shown that activation of H3Rs counteracts gamma oscillations induced by kainate in the hippocampus. Gamma oscillations have been associated with several higher brain functions, including memory encoding and recall, facilitation of synaptic plasticity, and maintenance of selective attention. Recent studies indicate that dysfunctional plasticity in different regions of the hippocampus is implicated in learning and memory deficits observed in experimental models of PD. Altogether, these observations raise the possibility that cognitive symptoms in PD may be associated with abnormal oscillatory activity in the hippocampus and suggest the potential utility of pharmacological interventions targeting H3Rs.

In this study, we used a mouse model of PD to examine thioperamide, a selective H3R antagonist, for its ability to revert dysfunctional circadian rhythm, long-term recognition memory and anxiety-like behavior. Given the involvement of the histaminergic system in the modulation of cognition-relevant oscillatory activity, we also examined the effect of H3R antagonism on hippocampal gamma oscillations.

### Stress triggers coronary mast cells leading to cardiac events [^5f00a16a]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

Stress precipitates and worsens not only asthma and atopic dermatitis but also acute coronary syndromes (ACSs), which are associated with coronary inflammation. Evidence linking stress to ACS was reviewed and indicated that activation of coronary mast cells (MCs) by stress, through corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) and other neuropeptides, contributes to coronary inflammation and coronary artery disease.

Data Sources

PubMed was searched (2005–2013) for articles using the following keywords: allergies, anaphylaxis, anxiety, coronary arteries, coronary artery disease, C-reactive protein, cytokines, chymase, histamine, hypersensitivity, interleukin-6 (IL-6), inflammation, mast cells, myocardial ischemia, niacin, platelet-activating factor, rupture, spasm, statins, stress, treatment, tryptase, and uroctortin.

Study Selections

Articles were selected based on their relevance to how stress affects ACS and how it activates coronary MCs, leading to coronary hypersensitivity, inflammation, and coronary artery disease.

Results

Stress can precipitate allergies and ACS. Stress stimulates MCs through the activation of high-affinity surface receptors for CRH, leading to a CRH-dependent increase in serum IL-6. Moreover, neurotensin secreted with CRH from peripheral nerves augments the effect of CRH and stimulates cardiac MCs to release IL-6, which is elevated in ACS and is an independent risk factor for myocardial ischemia. MCs also secrete CRH and uroctortin, which induces IL-6 release from cardiomyocytes. The presence of atherosclerosis increases the risk of cardiac MC activation owing to the stimulatory effect of lipoproteins and adipocytokines. Conditions such as Kounis syndrome, mastocytosis, and myalgic encephalopathy/chronic fatigue syndrome are particularly prone to coronary hypersensitivity reactions.

Conclusion

Inhibition of cardiac MCs may be a novel treatment approach.

### Utilization of antidepressants, anxiolytics, and hypnotics during the COVID-19 pandemic [^f9e965e7]. Translational Psychiatry (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Since the onset of the global outbreak in early 2020, the coronavirus disease identified in 2019 (COVID-19) has profoundly impacted the world. On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic. Three years into the pandemic, in May 2023, WHO stated that COVID-19 was no longer a public health emergency of international concern. China, the first country affected by the pandemic, implemented stringent lockdowns to control the spread of COVID-19, and many countries followed suit. Schools were closed, borders were, to varying degrees, closed, and various other strategies were employed to limit COVID-19 transmission. Some countries, such as Sweden, relied on less restrictive measures and recommendations to the population. With the disruptions to everyday life, coupled with the direct consequences of the disease itself, there have been concerns about the mental health impact of the pandemic. These concerns have led to calls for action to closely follow and mitigate the negative consequences of COVID-19 on mental health. If the prevalence of depressive disorders, anxiety disorders, and sleep disorders would increase in the wake of the pandemic, we would anticipate increases in utilization of drugs to treat these conditions. The question of this review is: how has the COVID-19 pandemic affected the utilization of antidepressants, anxiolytics, and hypnotics?

Antidepressants, anxiolytics, and hypnotics and their indications

Antidepressants are first-line medical treatments for anxiety disorders, unipolar and bipolar depression, the latter usually combined with mood stabilizers, such as lithium. Some antidepressants, such as mirtazapine, are also used as sedatives/hypnotics in clinical practice. Therefore, any correlation between changes in the prescription rates of antidepressants and the prevalence of specific disorders for which they are prescribed should be approached with caution. The term "anxiolytics" encompasses both benzodiazepines and "other anxiolytics". Besides treating anxiety symptoms regardless of diagnosis, antihistamines, such as hydroxyzine, may be used for pruritus and urticaria. While benzodiazepines are mainly indicated for anxiety and sleep disorders, they are, to a lesser extent, prescribed for other conditions such as catatonia. Thus, when speculating about prevalent indications for anxiolytics and hypnotics based solely on prescription data, caution is warranted. Benzodiazepines are, in many countries, controlled substances and often require in-person visits, which could influence prescription rates during periods of social distancing.

### Effectiveness of vortioxetine in patients with major depressive disorder comorbid with generalized anxiety disorder: results of the RECONNECT study [^8f5859e7]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2022). Medium credibility.

The observed improvement in symptoms of both depression and anxiety in patients receiving treatment with vortioxetine in this study is noteworthy as patients with MDD and comorbid GAD are generally considered difficult to treat, typically achieving poorer treatment outcomes than those with either condition alone. Assessment of the clinical effectiveness of drugs for depression in patients with a diagnosis of both MDD and GAD is rare; however, evidence of effectiveness in this patient population is clinically relevant given how frequently these two conditions are comorbid.

The beneficial effects of vortioxetine against symptoms of depression and anxiety are most likely due to its multimodal mechanism of action. Vortioxetine has been shown to be a 5-HT 3, 5-HT 7 and 5-HT 1D receptor antagonist, a 5-HT 1B receptor partial agonist and a 5-HT 1A receptor agonist, as well as an inhibitor of the 5-HT transporter. As such, vortioxetine modulates several neurotransmitter systems relevant to the neurobiology of depression and anxiety, including not only the serotoninergic system, but probably also the norepinephrine, dopamine, histamine, acetylcholine, gamma-aminobutyric acid, and glutamate systems. The effects of vortioxetine on 5-HT 1A, 5-HT 3 and 5-HT 7 receptors and the 5-HT transporter, in particular, are considered responsible for its anxiolytic-like effects.

### Vestibular migraine: an update [^409bd92b]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

FIGURE 3
Results comparison using the Niigata questionnaire in Persistent Postural Perceptual Dizziness and patients with migraine. IQR, interquartile range.

Other systemic comorbidities linked to VM may shed light on its biology. In 1975 'Chronic neurovisceral dysfunction' was coined to describe an conglomerate of features, among which vertigo or dizziness were usual, including asthma, bladder problems, sleep disturbances, rhinitis, tachycardia, gastrointestinal disorders and memory problems of potential central origin involving substances such as serotonin, histamine or mast cells.

Motion sickness in migraineurs responds to treatment with serotonin agonists such as rizatriptan. The metabolism of serotonin's precursor tryptophan seems to be altered in migraine, and is abundant in foods attributed to 'trigger' an attack, which may rather represent storing during the premonitory phase. It has been speculated that neuropeptide Y could be a therapeutic target during this phase, as it is localized in areas such as the hypothalamus, basal ganglia and limbic system, and involved in appetite control. Mast cells and histamine may also be involved in central pathways and external manifestations of cranial autonomic symptoms.

The presence of autonomic, inflammatory conditions and hypermobility conditions was higher in a recent study comparing patients with VM with chronic migraine patients. Specifically, the prevalence of Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome quintupled that of the general population.

Other conditions summarized in Table 2, including inflammatory connective tissue and other disorders usually linked to migraine also in pediatric populations, manifest higher vulnerability to develop further psychological symptoms.

Table 2
Examples of pain, inflammatory, autonomic and connective tissue comorbidities that could be present in patients with VM and psychological comorbidities

Inflammatory pathways in migraine are not clear, and may differ between males and females, as described in preclinical studies, in which stress and anxiety, paradoxically, did not influence female behavior.

Patients with MD overlapping phenotype could have a more inflammatory background. A relationship between dysautonomia, hypermobility syndromes, or the currently poorly classified and understood mast-cell activation syndrome could conceivably justify why a sub-population of migraineurs with a dizzy phenotype have, among their daily medication, an antihistamine such as loratadine or cetirizine.

### Efficacy of vortioxetine on the physical symptoms of major depressive disorder [^4a87e636]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

In this meta-analysis of five short-term randomized clinical trials in patients with MDD, vortioxetine significantly improved most of the physical symptoms of depression, as measured by the HAM-D and HAM-A. Further, in the subset of MDD patients with high baseline anxiety levels, improvements in physical symptoms were also observed.

The presence of physical symptoms in MDD patients is a significant predictor of a more chronic course of disease, with a lower probability of treatment response and remission of depressive symptoms. Residual physical symptoms may also increase the risk of recurrence.

Since comorbid anxiety disorders are observed in a substantial proportion of MDD patients (with ranges of ~30–50% reported depending upon population sampled;), the efficacy of vortioxetine on the physical symptoms of depression in MDD patients with marked coexisting anxiety symptoms is encouraging. A recent meta-analysis of 10 short-term randomized, placebo-controlled trials of vortioxetine in MDD patients with high levels of anxiety indicated efficacy in reducing depressive and anxiety symptoms in this group of patients. Together with the results reported here on the physical symptoms of depression, vortioxetine also seems to be a rational treatment option in patients with MDD and high anxiety, who often do not respond satisfactorily to alternative antidepressant therapy.

Although much remains uncertain about the pathophysiology of depression, abnormalities in serotonin (5-HT) and norepinephrine (NE) neurotransmission are probably involved in psychological and physical depressive symptoms. Pain control, for instance, appears to be influenced by both 5-HT and NE; this is consistent with reports that their analgesic effects seem to be mediated via common descending pain pathways. The 5-HT 7 receptor has been shown in preclinical studies to play a key role in regulation of circadian rhythmicity and sleep – physiological functions that often are disturbed in patients with MDD. Non-clinical studies with vortioxetine have shown that the compound modulates several neurotransmitter systems, including GABAergic, glutamatergic, serotonergic, norepinephrinergic, dopaminergic, histaminergic and cholinergic systems through complex mechanisms involving SERT inhibition and modulation of several 5-HT receptor subtypes, including the 5-HT 7 receptor. Further, in rodent preclinical models of analgesic activity, vortioxetine showed potential for mitigating centrally mediated pain, though no activity was observed against inflammatory pain. Modulation of neurotransmitters involved in neural pain pathways may mediate an analgesic response and consequently relief of painful physical symptoms associated with depression.

### Cross-species anxiety tests in psychiatry: pitfalls and promises [^e24afe78]. Molecular Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

Learned or instructed unavoidable shock anticipation

When rodents are exposed to contexts associated with unpredictable and uncontrollable foot shocks, they come to express increased freezing, enhanced startle reflex and will, if given a chance, avoid that context. While observable behaviour is somewhat similar to what is elicited by fear-conditioned cues, the underlying neural control is largely different. In general, benzodiazepine effects on startle reflex are challenging to assess due to their muscle relaxant properties, but there is indirect and direct evidence for context-specific startle reduction under the benzodiazepine chlordiazepoxide. Several experiments showed that corticotrophin-releasing factor (CRF) antagonists reduce context-potentiated startle as well. Since this paradigm involves contextual learning (and thus, creation of a longer-lasting phenotype as in common PTSD models), it is important to note that the studies discussed focus on the short-term expression of behaviour during and immediately after learning.

Grillon and Davis (Fig. 1F and Table 1) translated this paradigm to humans, with three different conditions: no-shock, predictable shock and unpredictable shock. In this so-called NPU test, context-specific behaviour (usually startle amplitude) is quantified by normalisation to the no-shock condition, and then compared between predictable and unpredictable conditions. Context-specific startle potentiation is found in this and other variants of the paradigm, as well as when US anticipation is verbally instructed rather than conditioned. Furthermore, humans show behavioural avoidance of the context. Most of the human studies discussed in the following use a verbally instructed version of the paradigm. Contextual startle potentiation (and additionally baseline startle) is reduced after treatment with 1 mg alprazolam but not 0.5 mg alprazolam or the sedative (non-anxiolytic) histamine-1 receptor antagonist 50 mg diphenhydramine. It is also reduced by chronic SSRI treatment in healthy individuals. A CRF antagonist (which has not been tested in clinical application) had no effect on contextual startle potentiation. See for a summary of the effects of further experimental compounds. In terms of diagnostic application, patients with PTSD, social anxiety and specific phobia and panic disorder, but not GAD, or MDD, show increased contextual startle potentiation, compared to healthy individuals. In a large (N = 258) sample of trauma-exposed people, posttraumatic symptom severity linearly related to contextual startle potentiation.

### Altered expression of histamine signaling genes in autism spectrum disorder [^786e704e]. Translational Psychiatry (2017). Low credibility.

In conclusion, the HS is involved in modulating cognition and behavior and has a role in neuroinflammation. Our study provides, to our knowledge, the first specific evaluation of the expression of a set of histaminergic genes representing histamine signaling in the brain of ASD subjects. Many questions remain about the involvement of this system in ASD and the potential overlap in pathogenesis of ASD with TS. However, our results, which are replicated in an independent ASD postmortem data set, provide a starting point for the investigation of this system in ASD.

### Gut microbiota and circadian rhythm in Alzheimer's disease pathophysiology: a review and hypothesis on their association [^50fc3b0e]. Npj Aging (2023). Medium credibility.

Gut microbiota and brain function

The association between the gut flora and the Central nervous system (CNS) is due to the interaction between the intestine and the brain with each other via the nervous system or chemicals which cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB). The gut flora produces chemical substances (i.e. amino acids and monoamines) that reach the neurons of CNS via the vascular and lymphatic system and can affect their activity, with probable influences on behavior. On the other hand, the gut microbiota is affected by the messages as neurotransmitters sent by the brain. Several communication pathways between the brain and gut have been investigated. The Vagus nerve plays a central role in the connection between the gut and the autonomic nervous system. This nerve ends to the brain stem nuclei, which give efferent fibers and receive afferent fibers. In this pathway, stem nuclei may regulate many gut activities and send signals to the other regions of the brain, such as the cortical areas and thalamus. Additionally, the enteric nervous system can send and receive signals from the CNS via the gut flora. Also, blood circulation is involved in the exchange between the gut and brain. Intestinal mucosa and BBB allow the passage of endocrine and immune molecules, the most important of which are hormones and cytokines, which can affect the function of both the gut and brain. Interestingly, it has been reported that gut microbiota affects the maturation of the endocrine, immune, and nervous system in germ-free mice. Gut microbiota regulates MGBA through different routes. For instance, these microorganisms can synthesize and release neuromodulators and neurotransmitters, such as biogenic amines (e.g. histamine, serotonin, and dopamine), short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), and other metabolites produced from amino acids such as GABA or serotonin and tryptophan. On the other hand, the other possibility for MGBA regulation by gut bacteria is that these microorganisms produce substances that are toxic to the brain, such as ammonia and D-lactic acid. In addition, during several inflammatory processes, the gut microbiota produces and releases other toxic proteins to the brain, such as host innate immune activators. Alterations in the mentioned processes, especially immunological processes, can contribute to anxiety, memory impairment, and other cognitive alterations. Recent studies reported that these alterations are associated with a variety of neurological conditions, including depression, drug-resistant epilepsy, and neurodegenerative diseases, especially AD, Parkinson's disease, and multiple sclerosis –.

### Mirtazapine for gastrointestinal and neuropsychological symptoms in older adults with irritable bowel syndrome [^05872013]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Clinical applications for symptom control — data from clinical studies

General IBS symptoms and quality of life

Preliminary data points to the potential role of mirtazapine in relieving the abdominal cramps and pain associated with IBS. Khalilian and colleagues conducted a randomized double-blind trial among 67 patients meeting Rome IV criteria for IBS-D, with randomization to a mirtazapine treatment group (n = 34) or a placebo treatment group (n = 33). They found that mirtazapine had higher efficacy in reducing the severity of IBS symptoms (p -value = 0.002) and the severity of all dairy-derived symptoms compared to the placebo. In addition, patients in the mirtazapine group had significantly improved quality of life and anxiety symptoms compared to patients in the placebo group (p -value = 0.005).

Migraine/headache

Worldwide, numerous investigations have revealed a substantial connection between migraines and IBS. Analyzing data from a prominent US health plan, a cohort study explored the prevalence of migraines among individuals with IBS, revealing that those with IBS faced a 60% elevated risk of experiencing migraines compared to those without IBS.

Dysfunction in central serotonin (5-HT) neurotransmission is central to migraine pathology. Chronic low levels of 5-HT contribute to migraine development, while sudden surges in 5-HT release trigger migraine attacks. In addition, migraine sufferers exhibit hypersensitivity to nitric oxide-releasing agents like 5-HT and histamine, which can lead to cerebral vasodilation, neurogenic inflammation, and trigeminovascular activation. The mechanisms behind mirtazapine's efficacy in treating migraines can be understood in two ways. The reduced occurrence of migraines with mirtazapine is attributed to its blockade of 5-HT2 (particularly 5-HT2B) and histamine receptors, which are implicated in migraine initiation. In addition, mirtazapine's activation of 5-HT1 receptors, including 5-HT1B, 5-HT1D, and 5-HT1F, may alleviate migraines by constricting dilated cerebral vessels and reducing neurogenic inflammation. However, at higher doses, the activation of histamine may contribute to migraine recurrence.

### Efficacy and safety of hydroxyzine in the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder: a 3-month double-blind study [^bae4e8cc]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2002). Low credibility.

Background

The prevalence of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) represents an important public health issue. Hydroxyzine, an antagonist of histamine receptors, showed both efficacy and safety in previous short-term double-blind studies over placebo in this pathology. The aim of the current study was to confirm those positive results over a 3-month period in adult outpatients.

Method

This multicenter, parallel (hydroxyzine [50 mg/day]; bromazepam [6 mg/day]), randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial included 2 weeks of single-blind run-in placebo, 12 weeks of double-blind randomized treatment, and 4 weeks of single-blind run-out placebo. Three hundred thirty-four of 369 selected outpatients with a diagnosis of GAD according to DSM-IV criteria and a Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety (HAM-A) total score ≥ 20 were randomized before entering the double-blind period. The primary outcome criterion was the change in the HAM-A score from baseline to 12 weeks of double-blind treatment with hydroxyzine compared with placebo.

Results

In the intent-to-treat analysis, the mean ± SD change in HAM-A scores from baseline to endpoint was -12.16 ± 7.74 for hydroxyzine and -9.64 ± 7.74 for placebo (p = .019). Results at endpoint for percentage of responders (p = .003) and remission rates (p = .028), Clinical Global Impressions-Severity scale score (p = .001), maintenance of efficacy (p = .022), and Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale score on day 84 (p = .008) also confirmed the efficacy of hydroxyzine over placebo. The study showed no statistically significant difference between hydroxyzine and bromazepam. Except for drowsiness, which was more frequent with bromazepam, safety results were comparable in the 3 groups.

Conclusion

Hydroxyzine showed both efficacy and safety in the treatment of GAD and appears to be an effective alternative treatment to benzodiazepine prescription.

### Lactose intolerance but not lactose maldigestion is more frequent in patients with irritable bowel syndrome than in healthy controls: a meta-analysis [^bfd38e7b]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2019). Medium credibility.

4 DISCUSSION

A growing number of studies have shown that intolerance to lactose‐containing products and other food types is more frequent among patients with IBS than among healthy subjects, but to our best knowledge, no meta‐analysis investigated the association between these two conditions so far. Only two recent reviews by Borghini and Bayless et al. 3, 47 discuss the correlation between IBS and LI.

We carried out a systematic literature search and quantitative data (meta‐) analysis on the topic. A pooled analysis of 14 case‐control trials confirmed a significantly higher prevalence of subjective and objective LI, whereas nearly the same prevalence of LM in IBS patients compared to healthy participants. The underlying mechanism remains unknown, but common etiological factors like psychological (eg anxiety) and gastrointestinal dysfunctions (eg visceral hypersensitivity and altered gut transit) might play a role. 28, 29, 30 The visceral hypersensitivity can also be in connection with altered gut microbiome. Gut microbiota of IBS patients is generally reduced and has lower diversity, compared to healthy controls. 48 It has been shown that potentially pathogenic bacteria (eg Clostridium spp, Ruminococcus spp, Streptococcus spp, Enterobacteriaceae members) are more concentrated in IBS patients than in controls. 49, 50, 51, 52 A recent MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) study concluded that visceral hypersensitivity, rather than excessive gas production is responsible for carbohydrate associated symptoms in patients with IBS. 53 The hypersensitivity to colonic distension can be transferred to mice by fecal transplantation which highlights the role of microbiome. 54 Moreover, gut microbiota produces many neuroactive or neuromodulatory metabolites (histamine, serotonine, gamma‐aminobutyric acid, brain derived neurotrophic factor, etc), which can potentially lead to peripheral or central neural sensitization. 55, 56

### Reply to "Acid inhibitors and allergy: comorbidity, causation and confusion" [^a778fbf1]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Considering the unidirectional phenomenon of an increased risk of anti-allergy medications after an anti-acid drug prescription, we agree that future research might reveal relationships linking dyspepsia and allergic diseases. Dr. Siah stressed correctly that observational studies and especially analyses of claims data, provide on their own no firm basis for cause-and-effect statements. Therefore, we referred the reader to the consistency of our findings with experimental data. Although we also agree that randomized controlled studies (RCTs) could, in principle, clarify whether or not the observed association is causal, we doubt that such RCTs will ever be conducted owing to a lack of commercial interest and because of the ethical issues.

As medical doctors, we regard gastric acid-inhibiting drugs as invaluable therapeutic options in a variety of dyspeptic diseases, if indication and reasonable prescription duration are considered. Also as MDs, we are trained to handle patients' many anxieties, and must take the responsibility to explain, prescribe, and discontinue the anti-acid treatments in a controlled manner. We further stress that guidelines, pointing to a discontinuation of acid-inhibiting drug prescriptions as soon as there is no further indication, should be adhered to.

### Sleep bruxism in respiratory medicine practice [^8ef6ee99]. Chest (2016). Low credibility.

Sleep bruxism (SB) consists of involuntary episodic and repetitive jaw muscle activity characterized by occasional tooth grinding or jaw clenching during sleep. Prevalence decreases from 20% to 14% in childhood to 8% to 3% in adulthood. Although the causes and mechanisms of idiopathic primary SB are unknown, putative candidates include psychologic risk factors (eg, anxiety, stress due to life events, hypervigilance) and sleep physiologic reactivity (eg, sleep arousals with autonomic activity, breathing events). Although certain neurotransmitters (serotonin, dopamine, noradrenalin, histamine) have been proposed to play an indirect role in SB, their exact contribution to rhythmic masticatory muscle activity (RMMA) (the electromyography marker of SB) genesis remains undetermined. No specific gene is associated with SB; familial environmental influence plays a significant role. To date, no single explanation can account for the SB mechanism. Secondary SB with sleep comorbidities that should be clinically assessed are insomnia, periodic limb movements during sleep, sleep-disordered breathing (eg, apnea-hypopnea), gastroesophageal reflux disease, and neurologic disorders (eg, sleep epilepsy, rapid eye movement behavior disorder). SB is currently quantified by scoring RMMA recordings in parallel with brain, respiratory, and heart activity recordings in a sleep laboratory or home setting. RMMA confirmation with audio-video recordings is recommended for better diagnostic accuracy in the presence of neurologic conditions. Management strategies (diagnostic tests, treatment) should be tailored to the patient's phenotype and comorbidities. In the presence of sleep-disordered breathing, a mandibular advancement appliance or CPAP treatment is preferred over single occlusal splint therapy on the upper jaw.

### Mechanisms of neuromodulatory volume transmission [^f62d7c60]. Molecular Psychiatry (2024). Medium credibility.

Neuromodulatory transmission broadly controls neural circuits and behavior. It is exceptionally diverse and includes many different types of transmitters. For example, several monoaminergic systems and many neuropeptides regulate nervous system function. Disruption or dysfunction of modulatory transmission is broadly implicated in brain disease, ranging from neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders to neurodegeneration and brain cancer. Furthermore, many medical treatments and drugs of abuse directly act on these systems. Hence, detailed molecular, cellular and systems level understanding of neuromodulation is a central goal of current neuroscience.

The main ascending modulatory systems signal through three monoamines, dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin. They also include the central cholinergic system. Neuropeptides, amino acid transmitters, additional monoamines (histamine, epinephrine, and melatonin), endocannabinoids, and other transmitters can also operate through volume transmission. Here, we focus on the ascending modulatory systems and assess their release machineries, their transcellular organization, and their transmission scales. We then discuss volume transmission features of amino acid transmitters and neuropeptides. We identify five domains through which these modulatory systems are specified, and assess them in view of the rich, mechanistic knowledge that has been developed for synaptic transmission.

### 'Gut health': a new objective in medicine? [^c59c315f]. BMC Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

In addition to the mucosal immune system, the ENS is another perplexing and complex control and defence system that is starting to become understood. The ENS contains 10 8 neurons and forms the largest neuronal network outside the brain. It monitors luminal conditions via sensory receptors and primary afferent neurons activated by secretagogues from enterochromaffin cells or mast cells such as biogenic amines (serotonin and histamine) or proteases. The ENS is strikingly independent from the central nervous system (CNS), yet it regulates almost all major functions of the gut, such as epithelial secretion, absorption and permeability; immune functions; and, as shown most recently, even the GI microbiota. GI infections, oral administration of antibiotics and chronic diseases such as IBS are clearly associated with morphological and functional changes in the ENS, which emphasises its role in mucosal defence. The ENS mediates multiple as yet undefined signals to the brain that seem to touch our awareness only under pathological conditions. Recent experimental studies strongly suggest that luminal conditions and signals, as well as the intestinal microbiota, are integrated into a gut-brain axis (GBA). For example, the stress-induced adrenocorticotropin hormone response in animals is much more pronounced in germ-free mice than in colonised animals. Such interrelationships might provide a scientific basis for any 'gut feeling' or the above-mentioned Asian understanding of the gut being the centre of spiritual and physical strength. The first hints that CNS diseases such as hepatic encephalopathy, depression and autism spectrum disorder might be treated by modulating the GI microbiome (for example, with the prebiotic and laxative lactulose, sugar-reduced diets or antibiotics) is a further argument for the relevance of the GBA. Moreover, experimental data have shown that probiotics, by modifying the GI microbiome, can affect both the ENS and the CNS, which highlights the relevance of the CNS for gut health. Such findings might explain, at least in part, why probiotics can show effects outside the GI tract.

### Allergy in panic disorder patients: a preliminary report (1) [^7d0f3dfe]. General Hospital Psychiatry (2002). Low credibility.

In this study of panic disorder patients, 71.8% were found to have allergies. Compared to the nonallergic subjects, the allergic subjects had more full-blown situational panic attacks and significantly higher scores on 7 of the 14 symptoms in the Hamilton Anxiety Scale. More subjects in the allergic group had comorbid anxiety disorders, but only the number with specific phobias was significantly higher than for the nonallergic. These results are discussed in terms of our present theories of panic disorder.

### Understanding neuroimmune interactions in disorders of gut-brain interaction: from functional to immune-mediated disorders [^aa0bb516]. Gut (2023). Medium credibility.

Psychological comorbidity

Psychological comorbidity, including stress, anxiety and depression, is common in patients with DGBI and affects symptoms and outcome (figure 2). Two studies have suggested a link between anxiety and depression on the one hand and duodenal eosinophiliaand mast cell degranulationon the other hand, although at this stage it is unclear whether this association was confounded by the presence of FD itself, which is known to be linked to both.

Stress may impact the intestinal barrier through a mast-cell dependent mechanism. A key mediator of this response is corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) which is not only secreted in the hypothalamus as part of the classical hypothalamo–pituitary–adrenal axis activation, but also by eosinophils in the GI tract which can then subsequently activate mast cells.CRH release by eosinophils is triggered by psychological stress, possibly through activation of NK1/2 purinergic receptors on eosinophils by nerve-derived Substance P. Moreover, increased expression of CRH in eosinophils correlated with symptom severity and life stress in patients with IBS-D. Mast cells carry CRH receptors and exogenous CRH has been shown to increase intestinal permeability in healthy individuals which was blocked by mast cell stabilisation and vagal nerve stimulation. Additionally, reduced expression of the antiinflammatory, antinociceptive and barrier-stabilising CRH receptor 2 (CRHR2) in duodenal biopsies of patients with FD was recently reported and may also contribute to stress-related mast cell activation in FD. Polymorphisms in both CRHR1 and 2 have been associated with IBS and anxiety, but how this relates to mucosal immune activation is unexplored.

### Hypocretins, neural systems, physiology, and psychiatric disorders [^ff26f5ed]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2016). Low credibility.

The hypocretins (Hcrts), also known as orexins, have been among the most intensely studied neuropeptide systems since their discovery about two decades ago. Anatomical evidence shows that the hypothalamic neurons that produce hypocretins/orexins project widely throughout the entire brain, innervating the noradrenergic locus coeruleus, the cholinergic basal forebrain, the dopaminergic ventral tegmental area, the serotonergic raphe nuclei, the histaminergic tuberomammillary nucleus, and many other brain regions. By interacting with other neural systems, the Hcrt system profoundly modulates versatile physiological processes including arousal, food intake, emotion, attention, and reward. Importantly, interruption of the interactions between these systems has the potential to cause neurological and psychiatric diseases. Here, we review the modulation of diverse neural systems by Hcrts and summarize potential therapeutic strategies based on our understanding of the Hcrt system's role in physiology and pathophysiological processes.

### Effects of stress on itch [^eb67618b]. Clinical Therapeutics (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Psychological stress and ensuing modulation of the immune and nervous systems can have a significant impact on itch. Stress can exacerbate itch and vice versa, resulting in a vicious cycle that can greatly impair a patient's quality of life. This review summarizes the association between stress and itch, elucidates the mechanism by which these two phenomena influence one another, and explores treatment modalities that aim to reduce stress-induced itch.

Methods

A complete search of the PubMed and Google Scholar databases was completed and literature pertinent to this review was compiled.

Findings

Both acute and chronic stress can significantly affect itch in healthy individuals and in those diagnosed with itchy skin diseases as well as systemic diseases, thus resulting in a vicious cycle in which stress exacerbates itch and vice versa. The mechanisms by which stress induces or aggravates itch include both central and peripheral activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and sympathetic nervous system. Activation of these systems, in turn, affects the mast cells, keratinocytes, and nerves that secrete neuropeptides, such as substance P, nerve growth factor, acetylcholine, histamine, and itchy cytokines. A dysfunctional parasympathetic response is thought to be involved in the chronic stress/itch response. Brain structures associated with emotion, such as the limbic system and periaqueductal gray, which work on the descending facilitation of itch, play a significant role in stress-induced itch.

Implications

As specific brain structures are associated with stress, drug treatments targeting these areas (ie, γ-aminobutyric acid-ergic drugs, serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors) may help to modulate itch. Stress can also be combatted using nonpharmacologic treatments such as cognitive-behavioral therapies and stress-relieving holistic approaches (eg, yoga, acupuncture).

### Recent hospitalization and risk of antidepressant initiation in people with Parkinson's disease [^4dcebdee]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Benzodiazepines and related drugs were used by every third antidepressant initiator, which may indicate sleep and anxiety disorders. Insomnia is one of the most common non-motor symptoms together with depression, and longer disease duration as well as dopaminergic medication increase the risk. Thus, the high prevalence of mirtazapine in our study could be partly explained by the use of low-dose mirtazapine for the treatment of insomnia. Mirtazapine has sedative properties mainly through histamine receptor blocking. Furthermore, previous study showed that about one-third of people with PD is suffering from anxiety, most commonly generalized anxiety disorder, and phobias. In addition, depressive symptoms and anxiety disorders often occur concomitantly and anxiety disorders are an important indication of SSRIs.

Depression and other neuropsychiatric symptoms seem to be poorly recognized in persons with PD since depressive symptoms could overlap with primary symptoms of PD. Better awareness and assessment of neuropsychiatric symptoms would promote more effective care. Management of these symptoms is important since they decrease quality of life and functioning in people with PD. As depression seems to be underrecognized, hospitalization might be opportunity to recognize depressive symptoms, and thus contribute to increased likelihood of antidepressant initiations after admission. Diagnoses of depressive symptoms might not occur as discharge diagnosis in this study since only main discharge diagnoses were observed. Neuropsychiatric symptoms can lead to hospitalization, thus would be important to prevent hospital admissions by managing those symptoms. However, initiation of antidepressant should be considered carefully, and hospitalization should not increase inappropriate drug use. Cognitive-behavioral therapy is effective management of depression and anxiety in PD and recommended to consider as a treatment option.

The main strength of this study was the use of the large nationwide registers with systemically collected data, enabling the identification of community-dwellers with clinically confirmed diagnosis of PD in Finland, and assessment of antidepressants dispensed in community-dwelling settings purchases. We had also comprehensive information on main discharge diagnoses of hospitalized patients. On the other hand, we lacked information whether purchased antidepressants were used, although purchased drugs represent drug exposure better than prescribed drugs. Since drug use during hospital care was not recorded in the Prescription Register, we lacked information whether antidepressants were initiated during hospitalization. Consequently, we did not know if antidepressant was prescribed during hospital stay or after hospitalization. Indications for the antidepressant drug prescriptions, information whether non-pharmacological treatment was attempted, and initiation of antidepressant was carefully assessed were lacking, thus we could not evaluate the appropriateness of treatment. Other limitation of this study was lack of information on the severity of PD and presence or severity of neuropsychiatric symptoms.

### Revisiting Montreal: new insights into symptoms and their causes, and implications for the future of GERD [^962186c2]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Because central hypersensitivity (more than peripheral hypersensitivity) is thought to contribute to allodynia, it may be of relevance to functional heartburn, which is by definition due to inappropriate pain responses to stimuli that are within the normal, physiological range. Evidence that central sensitization, whether caused by previous acid-related injury or other predisposing factors, may contribute to functional heartburn, comes from its overlap with functional disorders in other parts of the gut, such as irritable bowel syndrome and functional dyspeptic symptoms. In a recent post hoc analysis of pooled clinical trial data, the response of "substernal burning" to PPIs was found to be reduced if "dyspeptic-pain" was also present, possibly because the overlap of symptoms from different locations hints at a shared central sensitization (rather than acid reflux)-dominant etiology. In addition, there is substantial laboratory-based evidence that symptoms experienced by patients with functional GI disorders can be induced or exacerbated with the administration of lipids.

A single dose of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) citalopram has been shown to reduce esophageal sensitivity to balloon distention and acid perfusion in healthy volunteers with established esophageal sensitivity. SSRIs have been shown to significantly reduce symptoms compared with placebo in patients with reflux hypersensitivity (citalopram) and patients with reflux hypersensitivity or functional heartburn (fluoxetine) who are refractory to PPI treatment. In the only study to assess a tricyclic anti-depressant (imipramine) in patients with reflux hypersensitivity and functional heartburn, quality of life significantly improved compared with placebo, but symptoms did not. Histamine-2 receptor antagonists (H 2 RAs) have also been shown to modulate esophageal sensitivity to acid in patients with GERD, and patients with functional heartburn.

Psychological factors

The influence of the central nervous system extends to higher brain functions, with studies showing that psychological factors can increase the perception of heartburn (auditory stress and life stress) and esophageal pain (sleep deprivation). Psychiatric comorbidity is high among patients with functional dyspepsia and functional heartburn. Indeed, it cannot be ruled out that SSRIs may exert some of their effects on heartburn perception (discussed above) indirectly, via their effects on anxiety, mood, and sleep.

### Pharmacotherapy of anxiety disorders in the 21st century: a call for novel approaches [^f620ef34]. General Psychiatry (2019). Medium credibility.

While limited advances have occurred in the past 30 years in the pharmacological management of anxiety and stress-related disorders, novel molecular pathways both within and without the monoamine systems are currently under investigation and offer promising new avenues for more effective future treatments. Enhancing psychotherapy approaches with pharmacological compounds offers the potential to not only transform the standard of care of these conditions, but more broadly would introduce a paradigm shift in the way medications and their role in psychiatric care are conceptualised. Although further human trials and more translational research are sorely needed, continuing to pursue innovative mechanisms and treatments is hoped to yield substantial results in the coming decades and a departure from the reliance on chemical agents of the 20th century.

### AVN-101: a multi-target drug candidate for the treatment of CNS disorders [^001f69bc]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2016). Low credibility.

The fact that M1 appears in the blood stream simultaneously (T max ∼1 h) with and at a significantly higher concentration (C max) than the AVN-101, is in agreement with both the PK in dogs (Table 13) and fast metabolism of AVN-101 in microsome suspensions (Fig. 7). However, when AVN-101 entered the systemic circulation, its half-life was rather long (8–14 h; T 1/2 in Table 18). At the same time, elimination of M1 was somewhat faster, the T 1/2 was between 2.5 h and 3.8 h (Table 18). Noteworthy, the blood concentration of AVN-101 in human subjects is rather low and could result from fast redistribution into brain analogously to what we have observed with the rat blood/brain distribution.

Conclusions

A novel orally bio available drug candidate, AVN-101, with facilitated and predominant distribution into brain is a multi-target drug candidate that has an advantageous target fingerprint of activities with prevalent affinity to serotonin receptors, mainly 5-HT7, 5-HT6, 5-HT2A, and 5-HT2C, as well as to adrenergic α 2B, α 2A, and α 2C and histamine H1 and H2 receptors.

The AVN-101 has demonstrated positive effects in the animal models of both impaired and innate cognition. It also exhibited significant anxiolytic and anti-depressant capabilities. The primary therapeutic area for AVN-101 to be tested in clinical trials would be Alzheimer's disease. However, due to its anxiolytic and anti-depressive activities, there is a strong rational for it to also be studied in such diseases as general anxiety disorders, depression, schizophrenia, and multiple sclerosis.

### Paroxetine hydrochloride anhydrous [^131dd259]. FDA (2015). Low credibility.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY SECTION

Pharmacodynamics

The efficacy of paroxetine in the treatment of major depressive disorder, social anxiety disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), panic disorder (PD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is presumed to be linked to potentiation of serotonergic activity in the central nervous system resulting from inhibition of neuronal reuptake of serotonin (5-hydroxy-tryptamine, 5-HT). Studies at clinically relevant doses in humans have demonstrated that paroxetine blocks the uptake of serotonin into human platelets. In vitro studies in animals also suggest that paroxetine is a potent and highly selective inhibitor of neuronal serotonin reuptake and has only very weak effects on norepinephrine and dopamine neuronal reuptake. In vitro radioligand binding studies indicate that paroxetine has little affinity for muscarinic, alpha1-, alpha2-, beta-adrenergic- dopamine (D2)-, 5-HT1-, 5-HT2-, and histamine (H1)-receptors; antagonism of muscarinic, histaminergic, and alpha1-adrenergic receptors has been associated with various anticholinergic, sedative, and cardiovascular effects for other psychotropic drugs.

Because the relative potencies of paroxetine's major metabolites are at most 1/50 of the parent compound, they are essentially inactive.

Pharmacokinetics

Paroxetine hydrochloride is completely absorbed after oral dosing of a solution of the hydrochloride salt. The mean elimination half-life is approximately 21 hours (CV 32%) after oral dosing of 30 mg tablets of paroxetine daily for 30 days. Paroxetine is extensively metabolized and the metabolites are considered to be inactive. Nonlinearity in pharmacokinetics is observed with increasing doses. Paroxetine metabolism is mediated in part by CYP2D6, and the metabolites are primarily excreted in the urine and to some extent in the feces. Pharmacokinetic behavior of paroxetine has not been evaluated in subjects who are deficient in CYP2D6 (poor metabolizers).

### Practice parameter for the assessment and treatment of children and adolescents with tic disorders [^f8e16c32]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2013). Medium credibility.

Tic disorders in children and adolescents — genetic and environmental factors with PANDAS/PANS are described as follows: Chronic tic disorder (CTD) shows a genetic link, but candidate-gene association and nonparametric linkage studies have not yielded definitive susceptibility genes for tic disorders, and a recent genome-wide association study revealed that no markers reached a genome wide threshold of significance. Identified rare variants via cytogenetic assays and analysis of copy number variations have shown overlap with other neuropsychiatric disorders and affect a small percentage of those with tic disorders, and a parametric linkage study has ignited interest in histidine decarboxylase with implications for histaminergic and dopaminergic signaling in the striatum. Tics appear to be sensitive to environmental stimuli such as temperature changes, stress, illness, and fatigue that can exacerbate tics. PANDAS (pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric syndrome associated with streptococcus) describes childhood-onset obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and/or tics with acute onset following a streptococcal infection, neurological signs, and an episodic course, whereas PANS (pediatric acute-onset neuropsychiatric syndrome) describes sudden-onset OCD in which tics are not a required feature and a link to prior streptococcal infections is not always evident. In children with PANS/PANDAS, reported associated symptoms include separation anxiety, nightmares, personality change, oppositional behaviors, and deterioration in mathematics skills and handwriting, and studies suggest that in some cases a prior history of infections may increase risk for developing tic disorder, although this remains controversial.

### The role of mast cells in pediatric gastrointestinal disease [^802246cd]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Functional dyspepsia (FD)

FD, like other functional GI disorders, is best understood through a biopsychosocial model that incorporates the interaction between physiological factors (inflammation, visceral hypersensitivity, motility disturbances), psychological factors (depression, anxiety, somatization), and social factors (interaction with peers and family). There is evidence to implicate MCs as a key physiological factor in the pathogenesis of pediatric FD. Increased antral MC density is associated with slower gastric emptying and pre-prandial dysrhythmia in children with FD. Moderate to extensive degranulation of MCs is seen in the antrum of pediatric FD patients. Antral MC density also correlates with anxiety scores in children with FD. A correlation has also been noted between gastric MC density and symptoms of postprandial fullness and early satiety commonly seen in FD.

The above data suggest that there is an interaction between antral inflammation, gastric electromechanical dysfunction, and development of symptoms in pediatric FD. However, the increased small bowel permeability that has been demonstrated in subsets of patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is not seen in children with FD, even in the presence of elevated MC density. A study by Yeom et al found that headache associated with dyspeptic symptoms in pediatric FD patients is associated with gastric mucosal MC density, suggesting that MCs may functionally link the brain and the gut in pediatric FD.

MCs appear to play a key role in the pathogenesis of FD, modulating both gastric motility and gastric visceral hypersensitivity. This may help us to understand why certain antihistamines, such as cyproheptadine, provide symptom relief in patients with FD. Future studies should include the use of mast-cell stabilizing medications in the treatment of FD.

### Insomnia pharmacotherapy [^1d4bea9e]. Neurotherapeutics (2012). Low credibility.

The benzodiazepine receptor agonists (BzRAs) a melatonin receptor agonist and a histamine antagonist have all been approved as hypnotics. Beyond their differing mechanisms of action, they have differences in pharmacokinetics, and among the BzRAs differences in receptor subtype affinity and formulations, which provides the physician with broad options for tailoring therapy to each patient's specific needs. Consistent with their specific pharmacokinetics and formulations, these Food and Drug Administration-approved hypnotics have been shown to improve sleep with no evidence of tolerance development in long-term use. In addition, emerging data indicate these drugs also improve aspects of daytime function. Their side effects are either associated with the direct sedating effects of the drugs, doses greater than clinical doses, or a combination with alcohol or other sedating drugs. Anxiolytic BzRAs, sedating antidepressants and antipsychotics have been used off-label as hypnotics. However, in the absence of information regarding their dose range for efficacy and safety, their use as hypnotics is ill-advised.

### Label: HYDROXYZINE HYDROCHLORIDE tablet… [^429bf1da]. FDA (DailyMed) (2022). Medium credibility.

Hydroxyzine is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and hydroxyzine's clinical effects are usually noted within 15 to 30 minutes after oral administration. INDICATIONS AND USAGE For symptomatic relief of anxiety and tension associated with psychoneurosis and as an adjunct in organic disease states in which anxiety is manifested. The effectiveness of hydroxyzine as an antianxiety agent for long term use, that is more than 4 months, has not been assessed by systematic clinical studies. The physician should reassess periodically the usefulness of the drug for the individual patient. CONTRAINDICATIONS Oral hydroxyzine hydrochloride is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to hydroxyzine hydrochloride products, and in patients with known hypersensitivity to cetirizine hydrochloride or levocetirizine hydrochloride. Hydroxyzine is contraindicated for patients who have shown a previous hypersensitivity to any component of this medication.
- WARNINGS PRECAUTIONS THE POTENTIATING ACTION OF HYDROXYZINE MUST BE CONSIDERED WHEN THE DRUG IS USED IN CONJUNCTION WITH CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM DEPRESSANTS SUCH AS NARCOTICS, NON-NARCOTIC ANALGESICS AND BARBITURATES. Therefore, when central nervous system depressants are administered concomitantly with hydroxyzine their dosage should be reduced. In post-marketing experience, the following additional undesirable effects have been reported: Cardiac System: QT prolongation, Torsade de Pointes. Body as a Whole: Allergic reaction. Nervous System: Headache. Psychiatric: Hallucination. Skin and Appendages: Pruritus, rash, urticaria. OVERDOSAGE The most common manifestation of hydroxyzine overdosage is hypersedation. Other reported signs and symptoms were convulsions, stupor, nausea and vomiting. As in the management of overdosage with any drug, it should be borne in mind that multiple agents may have been taken.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION For symptomatic relief of anxiety and tension associated with psychoneurosis and as an adjunct in organic disease states in which anxiety is manifested: adults, 50 to 100 mg q. i. d.; children under 6 years, 50 mg daily in divided doses; children over 6 years, 50 to 100 mg daily in divided doses.

### The gut-brain axis: interactions between enteric microbiota, central and enteric nervous systems [^f0c49e39]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Evidence indicates that microbiota communication with the brain involves the vagus nerve, which transmits information from the luminal environment to CNS. In fact, neurochemical and behavioral effects were not present in vagotomized mice, identifying the vagus as the major modulatory constitutive communication pathway between microbiota and the brain. In a model of chronic colitis associated to anxiety-like behavior, the anxiolytic effect obtained with a treatment with Bifidobacterium longum, was absent in mice that were vagotomized before the induction of colitis.

Microbiota may interact with GBA through different mechanisms (Table 1), the principal one likely being modulation of the intestinal barrier, whose perturbation can influence all the underlying compartments. Probiotic species-specific central effects are indeed associated with restoration of tight-junction integrity and the protection of intestinal barrier, as recently reported in an animal model of water avoidance stress. Pre-treatment of animals with probiotic combined formulation of Lactobacillus helveticus R0052 and Bifidobacterium longum R0175 restored tight junction barrier integrity and attenuated HPA axis and autonomic nervous system activities, assessed through plasma cortisol and catecholamine measurements. Probiotics also prevented changes in hippocampal neurogenesis and expression in hypothalamic genes involved in synaptic plasticity.

Microbiota can interact with GBA also through the modulation of afferent sensory nerves as reported for Lactobacillus reuteri that, enhancing their excitability by inhibiting calcium-dependent potassium channels opening, modulates gut motility and pain perception. Furthermore, microbiota can influence ENS activity by producing molecules that can act as local neurotransmitters, such as GABA, serotonin, melatonin, histamine and acetylcholine and by generating a biologically active form of catecholamines in the lumen of the gut. Lactobacilli also utilize nitrate and nitrite to generate nitric oxide and to produce hydrogen sulfide that modulates gut motility by interacting with the vanilloid receptor on capsaicin-sensitive nerve fibers.

The ENS represents also the target of bacterial metabolites. One of the main product of bacterial metabolism are short-chain fatty acid (SCFAs), such as butyric acid, propionic acid and acetic acid, that are able to stimulate sympathetic nervous system, mucosal serotonin release and to influence memory and learning process. In this context, it is interesting to report that diet manipulation of microbiota may influence behavior. Mice fed with a diet containing 50% lean ground beef, have a greater diversity of gut bacteria than those receiving standard rodent chow, and presented an increase physical activity, reference memory and less anxiety-like behavior.

Paroxetine hydrochloride is completely absorbed after oral dosing of a solution of the hydrochloride salt. The elimination half-life is approximately 15 to 20 hours after a single dose of PAXIL CR. Paroxetine is extensively metabolized and the metabolites are considered to be inactive. Nonlinearity in pharmacokinetics is observed with increasing doses. Paroxetine metabolism is mediated in part by CYP2D6, and the metabolites are primarily excreted in the urine and to some extent in the feces. Pharmacokinetic behavior of paroxetine has not been evaluated in subjects who are deficient in CYP2D6 (poor metabolizers).

### Hydroxyzine [^f0da2c77]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Clinical Pharmacology

Hydroxyzine hydrochloride is unrelated chemically to phenothiazine, reserpine, and meprobamate. Hydroxyzine has demonstrated its clinical effectiveness in the chemotherapeutic aspect of the total management of neuroses and emotional disturbances manifested by anxiety, tension, agitation, apprehension or confusion.

Hydroxyzine has been shown clinically to be a rapid-acting true ataraxic with a wide margin of safety. It induces a calming effect in anxious, tense, psychoneurotic adults and also in anxious, hyperkinetic children without impairing mental alertness. It is not a cortical depressant, but its action may be due to a suppression of activity in certain key regions of the subcortical area of the central nervous system.

Primary skeletal muscle relaxation has been demonstrated experimentally.

Hydroxyzine has been shown experimentally to have antispasmodic properties, apparently mediated through interference with the mechanism that responds to spasmogenic agents such as serotonin, acetylcholine, and histamine.

Antihistaminic effects have been demonstrated experimentally and confirmed clinically.

An antiemetic effect, both by the apomorphine test and the veriloid test, has been demonstrated. Pharmacological and clinical studies indicate that hydroxyzine in therapeutic dosage does not increase gastric secretion or acidity and in most cases provides mild antisecretory benefits.

### German Society of Neurology guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of cognitive impairment and affective disorders in people with Parkinson's disease: new spotlights on diagnostic procedures and non-pharmacological interventions [^279126f4]. Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Unchanged from the previous German PD guidelines from 2016, the authors recommend venlafaxine and desipramine for the treatment of major depression in PwPD, as these drugs have been clinically investigated and have acceptable safety profiles. The authors recommend treating moderate depressive disorders in PwPD according to the clinical phenotype, distinguishing between PwPD with psychomotor retardation, agitation, or the coexistence of other influencing factors like pain, salivation, cognitive impairment, and sleep disturbances.

There were no trials that investigated the effect of medication on anxiety in PwPD without underlying depression. Clinical trials in psychiatric populations have shown a beneficial effect of citalopram on anxiety disorders. Although the clinical symptoms of PwPD do not correspond to those of a psychiatric population, a trial of citalopram for the treatment of anxiety symptoms can be recommended for PwPD.

Mirtazepine is a noradrenergic and specific 5-HT1A-mediated serotonergic as well as 5-HT2 and 5-HT3 receptor blocking substance. Numerous in vitro and in vivo investigations have demonstrated not only the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of Mirtazapine but also anti‑inflammatory and anti‑apoptotic effects. Due to the pathophysiology of PD, this might be of special interest and be advantageous in this target group. Because Mirtazapine can trigger REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) likely due to its lacking anticholinergic activity it should not be applied in concomitant RBD, which is common in PD. The HT2a/c antagonistic effect is likely to be advantageous in PD patients with psychotic symptoms. Mirtazapine has antihistamine sedative properties due to its histamine H1 receptor blocking effect and shows a good safety and tolerability profile. Therefore, it is broadly and preferentially used by Parkinson specialists in Germany in depressed PwPD especially with comorbid insomnia and without RBD.

Overall, four reviews suggest Mirtazapine in PwPD and moderate depression with concomitant night-time agitation, anxiety, restlessness, sleep disturbances/insomnia and/or hallucinations/psychosis. It has to be considered, that these suggestions are based on the pharmacological profile of Mirtazapine and with respect to the recommendation for PwPD with depression and psychosis on four case reports.

The following recommendations not only involved an evaluation of the results of RCTs but also considered the efficacy profiles of antidepressants, which have been reported in clinical studies of psychiatric patient populations. The authors evaluated these findings within the clinical context of PD.

### Structural basis for recognition of antihistamine drug by human histamine receptor [^e13156e0]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

The histamine receptors belong to the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily, and play important roles in the regulation of histamine and other neurotransmitters in the central nervous system, as potential targets for the treatment of neurologic and psychiatric disorders. Here we report the crystal structure of human histamine receptor H 3 R bound to an antagonist PF-03654746 at 2.6Å resolution. Combined with the computational and functional assays, our structure reveals binding modes of the antagonist and allosteric cholesterol. Molecular dynamic simulations and molecular docking of different antihistamines further elucidate the conserved ligand-binding modes. These findings are therefore expected to facilitate the structure-based design of novel antihistamines.

### Amitriptyline inhibits bronchoconstriction and directly promotes dilatation of the airways [^bf589c0e]. Respiratory Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Amitriptyline was the second tricyclic antidepressant to appear on the market for a major depressive disorder in 1961. In the brain, it inhibits serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake and exerts its effect at cerebral histaminergic and muscarinic receptors or on downstream pathways. Later on, amitriptyline therapy was used for a range of disorders such as chronic pain, sleep disorders or anxiety. In the 1960s to 1980s, several studies demonstrated the anti-histaminergic, anti-muscarine and anti-serotonin activity of this medication (e.g.), mainly in the brain. Radioligand binding analysis showed non-selective binding of amitriptyline to the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor in the brain and in other organs, but the M3 receptor, which is mainly expressed in the lung, was not investigated in detail (e.g.). As anti-muscarinic medication, systemically administered amitriptyline led to typical anticholinergic side effects, such as cconstipation, dry mouth, dry eyes, urinary retention and so on (e.g.). These effects paved the way for new, more selective and highly compatible antidepressants, like SSRIs and SNRIs.

### AVN-101: a multi-target drug candidate for the treatment of CNS disorders [^b288e85c]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2016). Low credibility.

Lack of efficacy of many new highly selective and specific drug candidates in treating diseases with poorly understood or complex etiology, as are many of central nervous system (CNS) diseases, encouraged an idea of developing multi-modal (multi-targeted) drugs. In this manuscript, we describe molecular pharmacology, in vitro ADME, pharmacokinetics in animals and humans (part of the Phase I clinical studies), bio-distribution, bioavailability, in vivo efficacy, and safety profile of the multimodal drug candidate, AVN-101. We have carried out development of a next generation drug candidate with a multi-targeted mechanism of action, to treat CNS disorders. AVN-101 is a very potent 5-HT 7 receptor antagonist (Ki = 153 pM), with slightly lesser potency toward 5-HT 6, 5-HT 2A, and 5HT- 2C receptors (Ki = 1.2–2.0 nM). AVN-101 also exhibits a rather high affinity toward histamine H1 (Ki = 0.58 nM) and adrenergic α 2A, α 2B, and α 2C (Ki = 0.41–3.6 nM) receptors. AVN-101 shows a good oral bioavailability and facilitated brain-blood barrier permeability, low toxicity, and reasonable efficacy in animal models of CNS diseases. The Phase I clinical study indicates the AVN-101 to be well tolerated when taken orally at doses of up to 20 mg daily. It does not dramatically influence plasma and urine biochemistry, nor does it prolong QT ECG interval, thus indicating low safety concerns. The primary therapeutic area for AVN-101 to be tested in clinical trials would be Alzheimer's disease. However, due to its anxiolytic and anti-depressive activities, there is a strong rational for it to also be studied in such diseases as general anxiety disorders, depression, schizophrenia, and multiple sclerosis.

### The ASAM national practice guideline for the treatment of opioid use disorder: 2020 focused update [^ff6f879c]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Physical examination — opioid use disorder: As part of the comprehensive assessment of patients with opioid use disorder, a physical examination may be completed by the prescriber him/herself or another member of the clinician's health system. The examination should include identifying objective physical signs of opioid intoxication or withdrawal, and Table 2 lists common signs of intoxication and withdrawal. Intoxication signs listed are drooping eyelids, constricted pupils, reduced respiratory rate, scratching (due to histamine release), and head nodding; withdrawal signs listed are restlessness, irritability, anxiety, insomnia, yawning, abdominal cramps, diarrhea, vomiting, dilated pupils, sweating, and piloerection. In addition, the examination should evaluate objective signs of substance use disorders; see Table 3 for a list of physical signs of substance use disorders (including opioid use disorder).

### Independent actions on fear circuits may lead to therapeutic synergy for anxiety when combining serotonergic and GABAergic agents [^4fca2054]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2002). Low credibility.

Issue

Both serotonin and GABA powerfully regulate the neuroanatomical circuit that mediates fear in anxiety disorders. This suggests that use of pharmacotherapies acting on both systems may provide synergistic therapeutic actions.

### Fentanyl (fentanyl system) [^150d547f]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Effects on the Cardiovascular System

Fentanyl produces peripheral vasodilation, which may result in orthostatic hypotension or syncope. Manifestations of histamine release and/or peripheral vasodilation may include pruritus, flushing, red eyes, sweating, and/or orthostatic hypotension.

Histamine assays and skin wheal testing in clinical studies indicate that clinically significant histamine release rarely occurs with fentanyl administration. Clinical assays show no clinically significant histamine release in dosages up to 50 mcg/kg.

Effects on the Endocrine System

Opioids inhibit the secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), cortisol, and luteinizing hormone (LH) in humans [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. They also stimulate prolactin, growth hormone (GH) secretion, and pancreatic secretion of insulin and glucagon.

Use of opioids for an extended period of time may influence the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, leading to androgen deficiency that may manifest as low libido, impotence, erectile dysfunction, amenorrhea, or infertility. The causal role of opioids in the clinical syndrome of hypogonadism is unknown because the various medical, physical, lifestyle, and psychological stressors that may influence gonadal hormone levels have not been adequately controlled for in studies conducted to date [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

Effects on the Immune System

Opioids have been shown to have a variety of effects on components of the immune system in in-vitro and animal models. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. Overall, the effects of opioids appear to be modestly immunosuppressive.

Concentration-Efficacy Relationships

The minimum effective analgesic concentration will vary widely among patients, especially among patients who have been previously treated with extended-release agonist opioids. The minimum effective analgesic concentration of fentanyl for any individual patient may increase over time due to an increase in pain, the development of a new pain syndrome, and/or the development of analgesic tolerance [see Dosage and Administration (2.1, 2.4)].

Concentration-Adverse Reaction Relationships

There is a relationship between increasing fentanyl plasma concentration and increasing frequency of dose-related opioid adverse reactions such as nausea, vomiting, CNS effects, and respiratory depression. In opioid-tolerant patients, the situation may be altered by the development of tolerance to opioid-related adverse reactions [see Dosage and Administration (2.1, 2.3, 2.4)].

### Diphenhydramine: time to move on? [^e82fd492]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2022). Medium credibility.

Diphenhydramine is one of the most widely available, longest-used antihistamine medications but has many side effects including sedation and risk of toxicity in overdose including cardiac toxicity. It is frequently inappropriately used when newer, more favorable antihistamine medications are available. Second-generation antihistamines are also widely available and affordable, with many of the same desired effects as diphenhydramine and fewer, if any, of the undesirable side effects. Because of the negative side effects and wide availability of alternative antihistamine medications, it is definitively time to move on from diphenhydramine.

### Mirtazapine is associated with shorter hospital stay in pediatric avoidant restrictive food intake disorder – A Retrospective chart review [^0c6cc929]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

The lower number of hospital days for the mirtazapine group suggests that the medication facilitated appetite increase and weight gain over untreated individuals. Research indicates that mirtazapine has metabolic effects that promote eating and weight gain, and we expect that those effects have played a role in this study (Laimer et al.). Total NG tube feeding days were fewer in the mirtazapine group, while the percentage of NG tube feeding days was similar to that of the no‐mirtazapine‐treated individuals. Mirtazapine is a serotonin, alpha‐adrenergic, and histamine receptor antagonist and leads to the release of norepinephrine and serotonin, neurotransmitters that affect mood and anxiety, while its kappa opioid receptor agonism has analgesic effects (Wishart et al; Anttila and Leinonen). An overall faster transition to food intake by mouth might be related to the anxiolytic effects of mirtazapine. Anecdotally, our patients reported reduced anxiety and improved mood, but whether those effects contributed to the normalization of food intake and weight gain requires further study. Mirtazapine has also alleviated functional dyspepsia and reduced gastrointestinal symptoms (Jiang et al; Carbone et al.). It is, therefore, possible that mirtazapine could have reduced gastrointestinal discomfort in our sample and supported food intake by reducing anxiety and pain and the sensation of fullness in response to eating (Matherne et al.).

### Immediate reactions to fluorescein and indocyanine green in retinal angiography: review of literature and proposal for patient's evaluation [^fd52374e]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2020). Medium credibility.

Mechanisms of Adverse Reactions

The mechanisms involved in adverse reactions to fluorescein have not been fully elucidated, but the following have been proposed:,

(1) non-allergic histamine release

(2) IgE-mediated hypersensitivity (immediate reaction);

(3) complement activation;

(4) disturbances of arachidonic acid metabolism;

(5) vasovagal phenomena (bradycardia and arterial hypotension);

(6) anxiety-related medullary sympathetic discharge;

(7) direct pharmacologic toxic effect resulting in vasospastic events;

(8) effect of contamination of the drug during the manufacturing process;

(9) destruction of the vascular endothelium through Factor XII and the coagulation system;

(10) combinations of the above.

In the same way as for fluorescein, the mechanisms involved in adverse reactions to ICG are not fully understood and the reactions may actually be due to sodium iodide or to the molecule itself. The following mechanisms have been proposed:

(1) non-allergic histamine release;

(2) IgE-mediated hypersensitivity (immediate reaction);

(3) complement activation (by disruption of the endothelial lining of blood vessels after the administration of IG);

(4) Release of other inflammatory mediators.

### General and anxiety-linked influences of acute serotonin reuptake inhibition on neural responses associated with attended visceral sensation [^5d9d553a]. Translational Psychiatry (2024). Medium credibility.

An association between serotonin and ordinary interoception might be expected because both are commonly associated with anxiety. The serotonin-anxiety relationship has been established by considerable preclinical research andeffectiveness as a first-line pharmacological treatment of panic and generalised anxiety disorder. SSRIs can also increase anxiety in the short term. The interoception-anxiety relationship is characterised by a theoretical understanding of the role of interoception in the pathoaetiology and treatment of somatic anxiety symptoms and backed by empirical observations of interoceptive disturbance in the same anxiety disorders that are treated with SSRIs. Modern conceptualisations of irritable bowel syndrome also acknowledge neural, genetic, homoeostatic and pharmacological overlap between gastrointestinal sensation and anxious states. In the lab, many of the same anxiety-linked responses that SSRIs acutely influence will vary with interoceptive sensation — including startle, fear, and emotion recognition. Conversely, SSRI treatment can also cause emotional blunting, which could be attributable to the general suppression of interoceptive processes, consistent with effects on aversive gastric interoception, or a change in interoception's influence on subjective affective experience.

The neural substrates of interoception, anxiety, and serotoninergic influence on cognition also overlap. At serotonin terminals, this occurs within the insular cortex and amygdala. However, serotonin's interoceptive effects could also occur at cell bodies within the raphe nuclei. The raphe nuclei contain cells that modulate appetitive, cardiac, respiratory, sensory, and thermal regulatory processes in response to interoceptive information and are thought to play a critical role in regulating anxiety. SSRIs disproportionately increase extracellular serotonin at the raphe nuclei following acute doses.

Overall, our knowledge about the relationship of serotonin to ordinary interoceptive processing has been promising but limited by the testing of abnormal, painful, visceral sensations in small samples, the study of patient populations with disturbed interoception, absent exteroceptive control conditions, indirect inferences and lack of neural insight. No direct link of serotonin to the neural processing of ordinary interoceptive sensation has been established.

### The histamine H3 receptor: from gene cloning to H3 receptor drugs [^dd619164]. Nature Reviews: Drug Discovery (2005). Medium credibility.

Since the cloning of the histamine H(3) receptor cDNA in 1999 by Lovenberg and co-workers, this histamine receptor has gained the interest of many pharmaceutical companies as a potential drug target for the treatment of various important disorders, including obesity, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, as well as for myocardial ischaemia, migraine and inflammatory diseases. Here, we discuss relevant information on this target protein and describe the development of various H(3) receptor agonists and antagonists, and their effects in preclinical animal models.

### Effect of interventions for the management of sleep disturbances in patients with long COVID: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^d736c121]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Two studies by Tartibian et aland Mosavi et alon aerobic exercise combined with mindfulness training and stimulation therapy with mindfulness training showed sleep improvements but were of low quality with a high RoB, thus not strongly supported as potential treatments.

Assessment of outcomes

Different measurement tools yielded varied results in evaluating the outcomes of long COVID–associated sleep disturbances. The PSQI was used in 50% of the studies (7 out of 14), consistently showing significant sleep improvements in both low and moderate RoB studies. Twelve out of the 14 studies reported only 1 sleep outcome using a single scale, whereas Li et aland Yang et aloffered more comprehensive evaluations by using both the VAS and TCM symptom scale. This underscores the need for more standardized tools to accurately assess the effectiveness of interventions for sleep disturbances in patients with long COVID.

Overall, 12 studies reported sleep disturbances alongside other long COVID symptoms. In particular, anxiety was noted in 10 studies, measured by various scales including the VAS (3 studies), Beck Anxiety Inventory (2 studies), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (2 studies), TCM symptom scale (2 studies), Brief Symptom Inventory (1 study), Quality of Life questionnaire (1 study), and Hamilton Anxiety Scale (1 study). Interventions significantly reduced anxiety in 9 studies, suggesting that improvements in sleep disturbances may be linked to effective anxiety management in patients with long COVID.

Ongoing studies

The assessment of ongoing studies illustrates the exploration of additional treatments for long COVID–associated sleep disturbances. A phase 2 RCT in Hong Kong is comparing individualized TCM treatments to conventional Western medicine over 4 weeks, using the Modified COVID-19 Yorkshire Rehabilitation Scale (C19-YRSm) to assess impact on sleep quality and overall symptom management. In the United Kingdom, a phase 3 trial is investigating Ashwagandha, a traditional Indian herb, in 2,500 adults with long COVID. Self-reported sleep quality will be measured using the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System 29 + 2 individual dimensions over 3 months. In the United States, a phase 3 feasibility trial is testing histamine receptor antagonists, cetirizine and famotidine, in survivors of COVID-19 with sleep disturbances over 12 weeks. Sleep outcomes will be measured using the ISI. These studies showcase diverse approaches, from traditional and herbal medicines to pharmacological treatments, in addressing long COVID–associated sleep disturbances.

### Altered expression of histamine signaling genes in autism spectrum disorder [^45d9df6a]. Translational Psychiatry (2017). Low credibility.

The role of the HS in neuroinflammation, cognition, sleep, attention, sensory function and motor function has received considerable attention, and recent evidence suggests that the HS may have a role in regulating microglia activation, cytokine releaseand migration. Furthermore, the HS may influence microglia mediated phagocytosis and reactive oxygen species production through the activation of histamine receptors. Within the central nervous system (CNS), this system consists of histaminergic neurons within the tuberomammillary nucleus (TMN) of the hypothalamus that have diffuse projections into the spinal cord, brain stem and many telencephalic brain regions. Histamine synthesis occurs predominantly in the TMN, where HDC is largely expressed. In addition, mast cells and microglia also express HDC and contribute to brain histamine, particularly in response to inflammation. Histamine inactivation by HNMT occurs throughout the brain. Four histamine G-protein-coupled receptors (H1R–H4R), encoded by the genes Histamine Receptor H1 (HRH1), Histamine Receptor H2 (HRH2), Histamine Receptor H3 (HRH3) and Histamine Receptor H4 (HRH4) are expressed throughout the CNS, although H4R expression is extremely low and its function within the CNS is not well characterized. Microglia express all four receptors and evidence suggests that histamine dose-dependently activates microglial activation and production of proinflammatory factors by binding H4Rand possibly H1R.

### Food allergy and hypersensitivity reactions in children and adults – A review [^505eed2b]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Adverse reactions after food intake are commonly reported and a cause of concern and anxiety that can lead to a very strict diet. The severity of the reaction can vary depending on the type of food and mechanism, and it is not always easy to disentangle different hypersensitivity diagnoses, which sometimes can exist simultaneously. After a carefully taken medical history, hypersensitivity to food can often be ruled out or suspected. The most common type of allergic reaction is immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated food allergy (prevalence 5–10%). Symptoms vary from mild itching, stomach pain, and rash to severe anaphylaxis. The definition of IgE-mediated food allergy is allergic symptoms combined with specific IgE-antibodies, and therefore only IgE-antibodies to suspected allergens should be analyzed. Nowadays, methods of molecular allergology can help with the diagnostic process. The most common allergens are milk and egg in infants, peanut and tree nuts in children, and fish and shellfish in adults. In young children, milk/egg allergy has a good chance to remit, making it important to follow up and reintroduce the food when possible. Other diseases triggered by food are non-IgE-mediated food allergy, for example, eosinophilic esophagitis, celiac disease, food protein-induced enterocolitis syndrome, and hypersensitivity to milk and biogenic amines. Some of the food hypersensitivities dominate in childhood, others are more common in adults. Interesting studies are ongoing regarding the possibilities of treating food hypersensitivity, such as through oral immunotherapy. The purpose of this review was to provide an overview of the most common types of food hypersensitivity reactions.

### Pharmacological treatment of anxiety disorders: current treatments and future directions [^8de96d08]. Journal of Anxiety Disorders (2012). Low credibility.

Modern pharmacological treatments for anxiety disorders are safer and more tolerable than they were 30 years ago. Unfortunately, treatment efficacy and duration have not improved in most cases despite a greater understanding of the pathophysiology of anxiety. Moreover, innovative treatments have not reached the market despite billions of research dollars invested in drug development. In reviewing the literature on current treatments, we argue that evidence-based practice would benefit from better research on the causes of incomplete treatment response as well as the comparative efficacy of drug combinations and sequencing. We also survey two broad approaches to the development of innovative anxiety treatments:the continued development of drugs based on specific neuroreceptors and the pharmacological manipulation of fear-related memory. We highlight directions for future research, as neither of these approaches is ready for routine clinical use.

### Efficacy of mirtazapine in patients with functional dyspepsia and weight loss [^a4182cd3]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2016). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

A subset of patients with functional dyspepsia (FD) present with early satiation and weight loss, for which there are no established therapeutic options. We investigated the efficacy of mirtazapine (an antidepressant and antagonist of the histamine receptor H1, the α2 adrenergic receptor, and the serotonin receptors 5-HT2C and 5-HT-3) in patients with FD and weight loss.

Methods

We conducted a randomized, placebo-controlled pilot trial that studied 34 patients with FD (29 women; mean age, 35.9 ± 2.3 years) with weight loss > 10% of original body weight (mean loss, 12.4 ± 2.3 kg) without depression or anxiety. After a run-in period, patients were randomly assigned to groups given placebo (n = 17) or mirtazapine 15 mg each day for 8 weeks (n = 17) in a double-blind manner. Subjects were evaluated during a 2-week baseline and 8-week treatment for dyspepsia symptom severity, quality of life (on the basis of the Nepean Dyspepsia Index), and gastrointestinal-specific anxiety; they were given a nutrient challenge test and weighed. Data were analyzed by using linear mixed models, followed by planned contrasts with adaptive step-down Bonferroni multiple testing correction.

Results

Two patients in each group dropped out. At weeks 4 and 8, mirtazapine significantly reduced mean dyspepsia symptom severity scores compared with week 0 (P = 0.003 and P = 0.017, respectively); there was no significant reduction in the placebo group (P > .37 for weeks 4 and 8). The difference in change from week 0 between mirtazapine and placebo showed a trend with a large effect size at week 4 (P = 0.059) that was not significant at week 8 (P = 0.55). However, improvements from week 0 to weeks 4 and 8 were significantly larger in the mirtazapine group than placebo group for early satiation, quality of life, gastrointestinal-specific anxiety, weight, and nutrient tolerance (mostly with large effect sizes).

Conclusions

In a randomized, placebo-controlled trial, mirtazapine significantly improved early satiation, quality of life, gastrointestinal-specific anxiety, nutrient tolerance, and weight loss in patients with FD. ClinicalTrials.gov number: NCT01240096.

### Microbiota-gut-brain axis mechanisms in the complex network of bipolar disorders: potential clinical implications and translational opportunities [^51c95e45]. Molecular Psychiatry (2023). Medium credibility.

A broader number of bacteria have been reported to be able to produce other monoamines like dopamine and norepinephrine whereas only Lactobacillus plantarum seems to take part in the synthesis of acetylcholine. Despite the role of gut microbiota in the modulation of dopamine and norepinephrine remains to be fully understood, germ-free (GF) animal models have shown that there is a noteworthy alteration of these neurotransmitters in the gut as well as in the brain, which could have important consequences in the behavior.

Last but not least, nearly 117 types of bacteria have been identified as major histamine producers. Apart from its well-known immunomodulatory role, histamine can act as a neurotransmitter in the brain, acting as a critical modulator of other neurotransmitters, and influencing arousal, motivation, and energy balance. Neurons located in the posterior hypothalamus projects to all the major regions of the CNS, also participating in the regulation of sleep-wakefulness. Likewise, the central histamine system in the brain is mediated via G-protein-coupled H1-H4 receptors and also appears to be involved in additional functions like arousal, control of pituitary hormone secretion, suppression of eating and cognitive functions. Currently, there are some hypotheses supporting that patients with BD may have an altered histaminergic system, with upregulated histamine levels in manic phases and downregulated in depression, being their fluctuations closely related to other pathophysiological mechanisms. An upregulated histamine production in the brain seems to drive to sleep-wake alterations in vivo, being associated with behavioral and metabolic disorders similar to those caused by voluntary sleep restriction in humans. Conversely, animal models have also established that low levels of histamine-induced depression-like behavior, decreased locomotor activity in the home cage, and impaired aversive memory, leading to a decrease in wakefulness as well. Hence, it is likely that the different alterations reported in the gut microbiota of patients with BD can be partially involved in the differential production of histamine and in turn this may be related to the described effects. Similarly, histamine production from gut microbiota appears to provide anti-inflammatory effects by suppressing TNF-α. Thus, compelling evidence suggest the relevance of gut microbiota as pivotal player of brain function, influencing in the levels of several neurotransmitters and neuromodulators.

### Single-cell genomics meets systems neuroscience: insights from mapping the brain circuitry of stress [^4e8a1922]. Journal of Neuroendocrinology (2025). Medium credibility.

Connect‐seq studies revealed subsets of upstream neurons expressed a large number and variety of neurotransmitters and neuromodulators, including fast‐acting neurotransmitters (GABA, glutamate, acetylcholine and glycine) and neuromodulators, such as biogenic amines (dopamine, histamine) (Figure 5). Consistent with the ligands expressed in upstream neurons, single‐cell transcriptome analysis revealed PVN CRHNs expressed a large and diverse array of ligand‐gated ion channels, receptors for neurotransmitters (GABA, glutamate, acetylcholine, ATP and glycine), and biogenic amines (dopamine, histamine, epinephrine, norepinephrine).

FIGURE 5
The 'interactome' of ligand‐receptors at CRHN synapses. Table illustrating the genes encoding neuronal signalling molecules (neurotransmitters, neuropeptides, biogenic amines, other neuromodulators) detected in presynaptic neurons using Connect‐seq. Upstream presynaptic neurons can employ these wide arrays of neurochemical messengers that can act via their putative receptors expressed on CRHNs to modulate, inhibit, or activate CRHN activity to elicit a physiological stress response during specific physiological or acute stressful conditions (psychological, physical, emotional, social and others).

The role of neurotransmitters in regulating PVN CRHNs is well established. GABAergic inputs provide tonic inhibition of PVN CRHNs, and the application of GABA receptor antagonists readily activates PVN CRHNs. Notably, GABAergic inputs might also be involved in stimulus‐induced suppression of PVN CRHNs activity, as suggested by certain odours. Similarly, norepinephrine is well‐established as a stress‐induced activator of PVN CRHNs. Using calcium imaging, a recent study tested the direct effect of a large number of bioactive substances, including neurotransmitters, biogenic amines and neuropeptides, on PVN CRHNs neuronal activity. These studies further confirmed the neurotransmitters, glutamate and acetylcholine, activated PVN CRHNs, whereas GABA and glycine inhibited PVN CRHNs. Furthermore, they have tested different biogenic amines (dopamine, serotonin, noradrenaline and histamine) and demonstrated their direct effects in rapidly activating PVN CRHNs.
