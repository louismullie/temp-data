## Question

In a newly intubated patient with severe ARDS and poor oxygenation (low PaO2:FiO2) and high plateau pressures, how would ACURASYS guide your decision to use early cisatracurium, and what outcomes should you anticipate?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how the ACURASYS trial should guide the decision to use early cisatracurium in a newly intubated patient with severe ARDS, poor oxygenation, and high plateau pressures, and what outcomes to expect. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether the patient meets the ACURASYS inclusion criteria and severity thresholds. Then, I should verify the timing of ARDS onset and whether this is truly "early". Next, I will review the intervention details from ACURASYS, including agent, dose, and duration. After that, I need to weigh expected benefits versus potential harms, including ICU-acquired weakness and sedation-related risks. Finally, I should integrate contemporary guideline positions and reconcile ACURASYS with the ROSE trial to make a practical, risk-stratified recommendation with monitoring plans.

> Let me first confirm the patient profile against ACURASYS. ACURASYS enrolled adults with severe ARDS within 48 hours of onset, defined as PaO2/FiO2 less than 150 mmHg with PEEP at least 5 cm H2O and tidal volumes of 6–8 mL/kg predicted body weight, and it excluded those already on continuous NMBA at enrollment, which fits a newly intubated patient with low PaO2/FiO2 and high plateau pressures if the onset was within 48 hours and other exclusions are absent [^113Vf2Jd] [^116PN5cj].

> Wait, let me verify the timing because that is critical. ACURASYS specifically targeted early ARDS, and the benefit signal is anchored to initiation within 48 hours of onset. If this patient is beyond that window, the applicability of ACURASYS wanes and the evidence base becomes weaker, so I should confirm the time since first meeting ARDS criteria before proceeding [^113Vf2Jd] [^116PN5cj].

> Next, I should review the intervention exactly as tested. ACURASYS used cisatracurium 15 mg IV bolus followed by 37.5 mg/hour continuous infusion for 48 hours with concomitant deep sedation, and the control arm also received deep sedation. Importantly, the protocol allowed additional boluses if plateau pressure exceeded 32 cm H2O for more than 10 minutes despite increased sedation, which is directly relevant to a patient with high plateau pressures [^113Vf2Jd] [^116PN5cj] [^111CYPoy].

> I will now examine expected benefits. ACURASYS showed a significant reduction in adjusted 90-day mortality with cisatracurium versus placebo, with crude 90-day mortality 31.6% vs 40.7% and adjusted hazard ratio 0.68, and it also reduced 28-day mortality and decreased barotrauma, including pneumothorax, without increasing ICU-acquired weakness in that trial. Meta-analyses pooling the French RCTs echoed mortality and barotrauma benefits, though I should note these pooled analyses are dominated by the same investigator group and may overestimate effects [^113Vf2Jd] [^116PN5cj] [^115wevLg] [^111Pz9iG].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about safety. Although ACURASYS did not show increased ICU-acquired weakness, the trial used limited screening and short follow-up for neuromuscular outcomes, and more recent guidance highlights that NMBA requires deep sedation, which is associated with delirium, delayed extubation, and possible neurocognitive harm. Thus, the net clinical benefit must be weighed against these risks, especially outside the exact ACURASYS context [^1164ARDL] [^114BdiCA].

> Next, I should review how contemporary guidelines position this. The 2024 ATS guideline issues a conditional suggestion for NMBA in early severe ARDS, emphasizing low certainty and restricting the recommendation to early disease with PaO2/FiO2 100 mmHg or less, while ESICM advises against routine early NMBA and supports selective use only when deep sedation is already required or dyssynchrony persists despite optimization. Surviving Sepsis suggests intermittent boluses rather than continuous infusion given conflicting mortality data and sedation trade-offs [^1164ARDL] [^116ryGu4] [^111TmEaR] [^1176aReC].

> But wait, what if I am overgeneralizing from ACURASYS? The ROSE trial, larger and more contemporary, found no mortality benefit to early continuous cisatracurium with deep sedation versus usual care with lighter sedation, and it raised concerns about more cardiovascular events and less physical activity in the NMBA arm. This discrepancy likely reflects differences in sedation strategy, baseline severity, and earlier enrollment in ROSE, so I should integrate ROSE as a negative trial that tempers routine use while acknowledging that ACURASYS may still inform selective use in the most severe, early cases with refractory dyssynchrony or high plateau pressures [^115BucrS] [^116j5Q1b] [^113wknkA].

> Let me consider practical implementation if I proceed. I should confirm that the patient truly has early severe ARDS, ensure lung-protective ventilation with low tidal volume and plateau pressure under 30 cm H2O, optimize PEEP and consider prone positioning, and only then, if dyssynchrony persists or plateau pressures remain high despite sedation, initiate cisatracurium as a 48-hour infusion with deep sedation and daily reassessment. I should avoid extending beyond 48 hours unless there is a compelling indication and monitor for weakness and delirium throughout [^1164ARDL] [^116ryGu4] [^114BdiCA].

> I should double-check dosing and monitoring. Using cisatracurium 15 mg IV bolus followed by 37.5 mg/hour for 48 hours aligns with ACURASYS, and while train-of-four monitoring is reasonable to avoid excessive blockade, evidence in ARDS does not show a clear correlation between TOF depth and oxygenation, so clinical assessment of synchrony, plateau pressures, and gas exchange remains paramount, with daily interruption or discontinuation planning if the clinical trajectory improves [^113Vf2Jd] [^112Xi2N8] [^114BdiCA].

> In summary, ACURASYS supports considering early cisatracurium for 48 hours in early severe ARDS with high plateau pressures when dyssynchrony or high transpulmonary stress is present, expecting potential improvements in oxygenation and a possible mortality signal in the most hypoxemic subgroup, but I must balance this against the negative ROSE trial, the harms of deep sedation, and the lack of modern mortality benefit, leading to a selective, time-limited, and closely monitored approach rather than routine use [^113Vf2Jd] [^115BucrS] [^1164ARDL] [^116ryGu4].

Early cisatracurium is indicated in newly intubated severe ARDS with **PaO2/FiO2 ≤ 150 mmHg** [^113Vf2Jd] and **plateau pressure ≥ 30 cm H2O** [^111CYPoy] when dyssynchrony or high transpulmonary pressures persist despite sedation and lung-protective ventilation [^116ryGu4]. ACURASYS showed an **adjusted 90-day mortality reduction** (HR 0.68) [^113Vf2Jd] and fewer barotraumas with a 48-hour infusion, without excess ICU-acquired weakness [^115wevLg]. Use cisatracurium for 48 hours with deep sedation, monitor train-of-four, and reassess daily; discontinue if improving or if there is no clear benefit [^116ryGu4].

---

## Clinical evidence from ACURASYS

ACURASYS was a multicenter, double-blind RCT that enrolled 340 patients with **severe ARDS** (PaO2/FiO2 < 150 mmHg with PEEP ≥ 5 cm H2O) within 48 hours of onset [^113Vf2Jd]. Patients received either cisatracurium or placebo for 48 hours, with both groups managed with lung-protective ventilation and deep sedation [^116PN5cj].

---

### Key outcomes

- **90-day mortality**: Adjusted HR 0.68 (95% CI 0.48–0.98; P = 0.04) favoring cisatracurium [^113Vf2Jd].
- **28-day mortality**: 23.7% vs 33.3% (P = 0.05) [^113Vf2Jd].
- **Barotrauma**: Reduced from 11.7% to 4.0% (RR 0.34, 95% CI 0.15–0.78) [^116PN5cj].
- **ICU-acquired weakness**: No significant difference (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.83–1.41) [^115wevLg].

---

## Mechanisms of benefit

Cisatracurium improves outcomes via several mechanisms:

- **Reduced ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI)**: Eliminates dyssynchrony and controls transpulmonary pressures, reducing volutrauma and atelectrauma [^115HmwHw].
- **Improved oxygenation**: Enhances recruitment and reduces shunt, improving PaO2/FiO2 [^116SEEfF].
- **Anti-inflammatory effects**: May reduce systemic inflammation, though this is less well established [^115HmwHw].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines provide **conditional support** for early cisatracurium in severe ARDS:

| **Guideline** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| ATS 2024 | Suggests NMBA in early severe ARDS (PaO2/FiO2 ≤ 100 mmHg) [^1164ARDL] [^116ryGu4] |
| ESICM 2023 | Recommends against routine NMBA; consider in severe ARDS with refractory hypoxemia or dyssynchrony [^111TmEaR] |
| Surviving Sepsis 2021 | Suggests intermittent NMBA boluses over continuous infusion in moderate-severe ARDS [^1176aReC] |

---

## Practical application and monitoring

When using cisatracurium:

- **Indication**: Early severe ARDS with high plateau pressures or persistent dyssynchrony despite sedation and lung-protective ventilation [^116ryGu4].
- **Dosing**: 15 mg IV bolus, then 37.5 mg/hour for 48 hours [^113Vf2Jd].
- **Sedation**: Deep sedation (e.g. propofol or midazolam) is required [^116ryGu4].
- **Monitoring**: Train-of-four monitoring and daily reassessment of need [^116ryGu4].
- **Discontinuation**: Stop after 48 hours or earlier if improving; avoid prolonged use due to weakness risk [^116ryGu4].

---

## Potential risks and limitations

- **ICU-acquired weakness**: No excess in ACURASYS, but risk increases with prolonged use [^115wevLg].
- **Deep sedation**: Associated with delirium and delayed extubation; use the lowest effective dose [^114BdiCA].
- **Conflicting evidence**: ROSE showed no mortality benefit, likely due to lighter sedation and earlier enrollment [^115BucrS] [^113wknkA].

---

## Summary of recommendations

Use early cisatracurium in newly intubated severe ARDS with **PaO2/FiO2 ≤ 150 mmHg** and **plateau pressure ≥ 30 cm H2O** when dyssynchrony or high transpulmonary pressures persist despite sedation and lung-protective ventilation. A 48-hour infusion with deep sedation is supported by ACURASYS, with expected benefits including reduced 90-day mortality and barotrauma, and no excess ICU-acquired weakness. Monitor closely, reassess daily, and discontinue promptly if improving or if no benefit is observed [^113Vf2Jd] [^115wevLg].

Grade recommendation justification

The use of cisatracurium besylate in adults suffering early, severe ARDS was given a weakly positive recommendation based on moderate evidence quality. The group felt it was appropriate to recommend this management protocol because it was the only one studied by RCT. Due to the nature of this intervention, it should only be given to patients who are adequately sedated and receiving invasive ventilation. As such, it would have been difficult to recruit patients with mild ARDS.

Although it is reassuring that in all three RCTs the point estimate of treatment effect indicated a survival benefit, it was only by pooling these data in MA that these findings reached statistical significance. There are also concerns over the ineffective blinding of caregivers to study group allocation in the clinical trials and concerns that the potential association of NMBA and ICU-acquired weakness was not studied in a robust manner.

Background

In patients undergoing mechanical ventilation for the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), neuromuscular blocking agents may improve oxygenation and decrease ventilator-induced lung injury but may also cause muscle weakness. We evaluated clinical outcomes after 2 days of therapy with neuromuscular blocking agents in patients with early, severe ARDS.

Methods

In this multicenter, double-blind trial, 340 patients presenting to the intensive care unit (ICU) with an onset of severe ARDS within the previous 48 hours were randomly assigned to receive, for 48 hours, either cisatracurium besylate (178 patients) or placebo (162 patients). Severe ARDS was defined as a ratio of the partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO2) to the fraction of inspired oxygen (FIO2) of less than 150, with a positive end-expiratory pressure of 5 cm or more of water and a tidal volume of 6 to 8 mL per kilogram of predicted body weight. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients who died either before hospital discharge or within 90 days after study enrollment (i.e., the 90-day in-hospital mortality rate), adjusted for predefined covariates and baseline differences between groups with the use of a Cox model.

Results

The hazard ratio for death at 90 days in the cisatracurium group, as compared with the placebo group, was 0.68 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.48 to 0.98; P = 0.04), after adjustment for both the baseline PaO2:FIO2 and plateau pressure and the Simplified Acute Physiology II score. The crude 90-day mortality was 31.6% (95% CI, 25.2 to 38.8) in the cisatracurium group and 40.7% (95% CI, 33.5 to 48.4) in the placebo group (P = 0.08). Mortality at 28 days was 23.7% (95% CI, 18.1 to 30.5) with cisatracurium and 33.3% (95% CI, 26.5 to 40.9) with placebo (P = 0.05). The rate of ICU-acquired paresis did not differ significantly between the two groups.

Conclusions

In patients with severe ARDS, early administration of a neuromuscular blocking agent improved the adjusted 90-day survival and increased the time off the ventilator without increasing muscle weakness.

ARDS severity and the timing of NMBA therapy also factored into the conditional recommendation. Although the included trials enrolled patients with moderate to severe ARDS, the baseline Pa O 2 /F O 2 ratio of enrolled patients was closer to 100 mm Hg. Additionally, the majority of patients included were enrolled within the first 48 hours of mechanical ventilation. Given these considerations, the panel limited this recommendation to early (< 48 h since ARDS onset) severe (Pa O 2 /F O 2 ratio ≤ 100 mm Hg) ARDS; no recommendation could be made for later initiation or less severe ARDS.

Other considerations for implementation include agent selection and duration of therapy. Although this guideline does not recommend a specific NMBA, cisatracurium was used in the two largest RCTs and may be associated with pleiotropic effects, including a decrease in inflammatory cytokines, suggesting that it may be a preferable NMBA for patients with ARDS. Additionally, although the included studies primarily used continuous NMBA infusions, bolus dosing may also be suitable for some patients. With regard to duration, NMBAs were administered for as long as 48 hours in the majority of study patients, with earlier termination in patients whose condition improved rapidly; it is unknown whether a longer duration of use is associated with an increased risk of adverse events. In light of these factors, an appropriate strategy for NMBAs may involve reserving their use for patients with early severe ARDS who are already receiving deep sedation or who, while under light sedation, have evidence of significant ventilator dyssynchrony with associated clinical deterioration that is not mitigated by adjustments to ventilator settings or sedation. In keeping with the included trials, NMBA duration should be limited to a maximum of 48 hours whenever possible.

### Early neuromuscular blockade in the acute respiratory distress syndrome [^115BucrS]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2019). Excellent credibility.

Background

The benefits of early continuous neuromuscular blockade in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) who are receiving mechanical ventilation remain unclear.

Methods

We randomly assigned patients with moderate-to-severe ARDS (defined by a ratio of the partial pressure of arterial oxygen to the fraction of inspired oxygen of < 150 mm Hg with a positive end-expiratory pressure [PEEP] of ≥ 8 cm of water) to a 48-hour continuous infusion of cisatracurium with concomitant deep sedation (intervention group) or to a usual-care approach without routine neuromuscular blockade and with lighter sedation targets (control group). The same mechanical-ventilation strategies were used in both groups, including a strategy involving a high PEEP. The primary end point was in-hospital death from any cause at 90 days.

Results

The trial was stopped at the second interim analysis for futility. We enrolled 1006 patients early after the onset of moderate-to-severe ARDS (median, 7.6 hours after onset). During the first 48 hours after randomization, 488 of the 501 patients (97.4%) in the intervention group started a continuous infusion of cisatracurium (median duration of infusion, 47.8 hours; median dose, 1807 mg), and 86 of the 505 patients (17.0%) in the control group received a neuromuscular blocking agent (median dose, 38 mg). At 90 days, 213 patients (42.5%) in the intervention group and 216 (42.8%) in the control group had died before hospital discharge (between-group difference, -0.3 percentage points; 95% confidence interval, -6.4 to 5.9; P = 0.93). While in the hospital, patients in the intervention group were less physically active and had more adverse cardiovascular events than patients in the control group. There were no consistent between-group differences in end points assessed at 3, 6, and 12 months.

Conclusions

Among patients with moderate-to-severe ARDS who were treated with a strategy involving a high PEEP, there was no significant difference in mortality at 90 days between patients who received an early and continuous cisatracurium infusion and those who were treated with a usual-care approach with lighter sedation targets.

PICO question

In adults with ARDS, does the use of NMBA, compared with standard care, affect survival and selected outcomes?

Study identification

The search strategy was predefined as per online appendix C. The only NMBA studied in an RCT considering outcomes relevant to our PICO question was cisatracurium besylate. Four SR were identified, published between 2012 and 2015, of which only two included MA. When analysing results, we used the most recent SR with MAthat considered the outcome in question. The two selected SR with MA included the three RCTs of NMBAs that were identified, both of which compared a continuous 48 hours infusion of cisatracurium with standard care. These RCTs were published between 2004 and 2010 and included a total of 431 participants from 20 French ICUs.

A GRADE Summary of Findings table is shown based on critical and important outcomes (table 8). A full GRADE evidence table can be found as part of online appendix B.

### Effect of low-normal vs high-normal oxygenation targets on organ dysfunction in critically ill patients… [^111HwSsc]. JAMA Network (2021). Excellent credibility.

The figure shows that patients randomized to a high-normal Pao2 target had nonsignificantly lower scores. The median SOFARANK score was −35 points in the low-normal group vs −40 points in the high-normal group. © 2025 Questions Does a low-normal oxygenation compared with a high-normal oxygenation target range reduce organ dysfunction in critically ill patients. Findings This randomized clinical trial included 400 patients in the intensive care unit with at least 2 positive systemic inflammatory response syndrome criteria. Randomization to a target Pao2 range of 8 to 12 kPa vs 14 to 18 kPa resulted in a median SOFARANK score of −35 vs −40, a difference that was not statistically significant.

Meanings Among critically ill patients, targeting oxygenation to a low-normal range compared with a high-normal range did not result in a statistically significant reduction in organ dysfunction. Importance Hyperoxemia may increase organ dysfunction in critically ill patients, but optimal oxygenation targets are unknown. Objective To determine whether a low-normal Pao2 target compared with a high-normal target reduces organ dysfunction in critically ill patients with systemic inflammatory response syndrome. The median SOFARANK score was −35 points in the low-normal Pao2 group vs −40 in the high-normal Pao2 group. Mild hypoxemic measurements occurred more often in the low-normal group.

Acute kidney failure developed in 20 patients in the low-normal Pao2 group and 21 patients in the high-normal Pao2 group, and acute myocardial infarction in 6 patients in the low-normal Pao2 group and 7 patients in the high-normal Pao2 group. Conclusions and Relevance Among critically ill patients with 2 or more SIRS criteria, treatment with a low-normal Pao2 target compared with a high-normal Pao2 target did not result in a statistically significant reduction in organ dysfunction. However, the study may have had limited power to detect a smaller treatment effect than was hypothesized. Oxygen was administered to target either a low-normal Pao2 range of 8 to 12 kPa or a high-normal Pao2 range from 14 to 18 kPa. The target Pao2 was achieved by adjustment of the Fio2 and/or positive end-expiratory pressure if patients were mechanically ventilated.

Levels to achieve the target Pao2 were maximized to an Fio2 of 0. 60 and 10 cm H2O of PEEP unless clinically otherwise indicated. Prone positioning during mechanical ventilation, change from oxygen mask to noninvasive mechanical ventilation, and intubation were only applied on clinical indication, not to achieve the Pao2 targets of the trial. The intervention commenced within 12 hours after ICU admission and was maintained until the earliest occurrence of either day 14, ICU discharge, or death. Time-weighted values of Pao2, arterial oxygen saturation, Spo2, and Fio2 were calculated. Data collection is described in eAppendix 1 in Supplement 2. No patients were lost to follow-up and there were no missing baseline or end point data. Baseline characteristics were comparable in both groups. The median time from ICU admission to inclusion was 4. 0 hours in the low-normal Pao2 group and
4. 0 hours (IQR, 2. 1–7.

### An update on management of adult patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome: an official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^1164ARDL]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). High credibility.

American Thoracic Society ARDS guideline — neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBAs): We suggest using neuromuscular blockade in patients with early severe ARDS (conditional recommendation, low certainty). In seven RCTs that included 1,598 patients, NMBAs may decrease mortality versus no NMBA (RR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.56–0.98; low certainty), with mortality reduction when compared with deep sedation (n = 3 studies, 431 patients; RR, 0.72, 95% CI, 0.58–0.91) but not light sedation (RR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.86–1.15). NMBAs were probably associated with a reduced incidence of barotrauma (n = 4 studies, 1,437 patients; RR, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.35–0.85) and a possible increase in ventilator-free days (n = 5 studies; MD, 0.89 more; 95% CI, 0.38 fewer to 2.18 more), but also probably increased the rates of ICU-acquired weakness (n = 4 studies, 885 patients; RR, 1.16; 95% CI, 0.98–1.37). The panel specified timing and severity qualifiers: the balance of benefits might be greatest when treatment is targeted to early (< 48 h since ARDS onset) and severe (Pao2/Fio2 ratio < 100 mm Hg) ARDS; no recommendation could be made for later initiation or less severe ARDS. Although this guideline does not recommend a specific NMBA, cisatracurium was used in the two largest RCTs and was noted as possibly preferable; with regard to duration, NMBAs were administered for as long as 48 hours in the majority of study patients, and NMBA duration should be limited to a maximum of 48 hours whenever possible; an appropriate strategy may involve reserving use for early severe ARDS in deeply sedated patients or, under light sedation, when significant ventilator dyssynchrony or clinical deterioration persists despite ventilator or sedation adjustments.

### Comparison of cisatracurium versus atracurium in early ARDS [^111rYmyB]. Respiratory Care (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Administration of cisatracurium in severe ARDS decreases in-hospital mortality. Whether clinical outcomes are cisatracurium-specific or related with all neuromuscular blockers is unknown. This study aimed to compare outcomes in severe ARDS patients treated with cisatracurium versus atracurium.

Methods

Patients admitted in ICUs with a diagnosis of severe ARDS and treated with neuromuscular blocking agents within 72 h of diagnosis were included. Subjects treated with cisatracurium versus atracurium were compared. The primary outcome was improvement in oxygenation, defined as the difference of P aO2 /F IO2 at 72 h post-initiation of neuromuscular blocking agents. Secondary outcomes were ventilator-free days at day 28, ICU and hospital lengths of stay, and hospital mortality.

Results

Seventy-six subjects with ARDS were included in the study. Eighteen subjects (24%) were treated with atracurium, whereas 58 (76%) were treated with cisatracurium. Equivalent dosages of sedation and analgesia as well as use of brain function monitoring technology were similar between both groups. There were no differences in clinical outcomes. Specifically, improvement of P aO2 /F IO2 was a median (interquartile range [IQR]) of 65 (25–162) in the atracurium group and 66 (IQR 16–147) in the cisatracurium group (P = 0.65). Ventilator-free days at day 28 were 13 d (IQR 0–22 d) and 15 d (IQR 8–21 d) in the atracurium and cisatracurium groups, respectively (P = 0.72). ICU length or stay was 18 d (IQR 8–34 d) in the atracurium group and 15 d (IQR 9–22 d) in the cisatracurium group (P = 0.34). In-hospital mortality was 50% for the atracurium population and 62% for the cisatracurium group (P = 0.42) CONCLUSIONS: Among subjects with early severe ARDS, the utilization of atracurium versus cisatracurium within 72 h of admission was not associated with significant differences in clinical outcomes.

### Neuromuscular blocking agents in acute respiratory distress syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^113HdGqf]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a common and life-threatening condition that complicates a variety of critical illnesses, including sepsis, pneumonia, and trauma. Characterized by intense lung inflammation, consolidation, and progressive microatelectasis, ARDS is associated clinically with severe hypoxemia, patient-ventilator dyssynchrony, and high susceptibility to barotrauma and ventilator-induced lung injury. Approximately 140,000 patients are affected by ARDS annually in the United States alone. Despite advances in the relevant technology and research methods, mortality from ARDS remains as high as 26% to 58%.

Although relatively few interventions may improve survival for patients with ARDS, the interventions with most supportive research findings are ventilation strategies that aim to minimize ventilator-induced lung injury. In a landmark clinical trial, low-tidal-volume ventilation was found to improve survival for critically ill adults with acute lung injury or ARDS, and a systematic review of 10 related randomized trials supports this finding. Whereas a lung-protective role for high levels of PEEP in adult ARDS is less clear, a patient-level meta-analysis including 2,299 participants from three trials suggests lower mortality, particularly for moderate to severe ARDS. Prone ventilation may also have a lung-protective effect. Similarly, neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBAs) may have an important role in the management of critically ill adults with ARDS.

Clinicians commonly rely on NMBAs in the management of ARDS to prevent patient-ventilator dyssynchrony, to minimize the work of breathing, and to improve oxygenation. Indeed, an early, small, randomized trial demonstrated improved oxygenation with continuous cisatracurium therapy. In a subsequent trial, the same group of investigators found a statistically significant reduction in inflammatory biomarkers in both the blood and bronchoalveolar fluid of patients treated with cisatracurium, along with improved oxygenation. Recently, they reported a trial of 339 patients that did not show a statistically significant reduction in crude hospital mortality. These potential benefits must be weighed against prevailing concerns about NMBA therapy, including progressive atelectasis due to loss of diaphragmatic tone (with resultant hypoxemia) and, most important, ICU-acquired weakness. Those concerns previously led one guideline panel to suggest NMBAs as a consideration only in the setting of severe hypoxemia, and another to recommend avoiding NMBAs.

### Neuromuscular blocking agents in acute respiratory distress syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^116ZXPQC]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

Discussion

In this meta-analysis, we found that the treatment of critically ill adults with a 48-hour continuous infusion of cisatracurium besylate consistently reduced the risk of death at 28 days, ICU discharge, and hospital discharge, reduced the risk of barotrauma, and did not affect the duration of mechanical ventilation or the risk of ICU-acquired weakness.

In terms of the mortality reduction associated with NMBA therapy, our findings are large and robust. We determined that for every nine adults with ARDS receiving cisatracurium therapy, one additional life is saved during the first 90 days in hospital. This magnitude of effect is larger than that achieved with low-tidal-volume ventilation. Moreover, sensitivity analyses using odds ratios or absolute risk difference produced similar statistically significant findings. Duration of mechanical ventilation was not significantly different between groups, including groups of patients who survived (Figure 4). However, VFDs were increased in the cisatracurium group, as a result of competing risks of death and duration of ventilation, both of which are integrated into this outcome.

The present systematic review builds on the similar findings of a recent review by Neto et al. We analyzed important new and previously unpublished data about hospital mortality, an outcome that carries more weight in clinical decision making and clinical-practice guidelines. Moreover, we present additional subgroup analyses addressing severity of hypoxemia and etiology of ARDS, as well as more-complete analyses related to the duration of ventilation.

Clinical observations and systematic research both support the notion that NMBA therapy improves oxygenation among critically ill patients with ARDS, although the mechanism leading to this effect is not entirely clear. In terms of lung mechanics, better synchrony may lead to more-uniform lung recruitment, improved compliance, better gas exchange, and better systemic oxygenation. With respect to lung inflammation, it is plausible that improved control of inspiratory volumes and pressures reduces volutrauma, while better control of expiratory volumes and pressures reduces atelectrauma; the result being less pulmonary and systemic inflammation. The latter hypothesis is supported by one of the three trials included in this review, which demonstrated a significant reduction in pulmonary levels of IL-6, IL-8, and IL-1B in cisatracurium-treated patients, along with improved oxygenation. Whatever the mechanism, this review found a corresponding improvement in early mortality.

### Neuromuscular blocking agents in acute respiratory distress syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^112oKnfw]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

Key messages

- Few published studies suggested that the use of neuromuscular blocking agents improves lung mechanics, patient-ventilator asynchrony, and reduces inflammatory mediators in patients with ARDS.

- A recently published randomized controlled trial suggested that the use of cisatracurium in patients with ARDS may reduce mortality.

- A systematic review and meta-analysis of RCTs examining the effect of using NMBA (cisatracurium) resulted in a significant reduction in risk of death at 28 days and at ICU and hospital discharge when compared with placebo or no intervention. The risk of barotrauma was reduced with no increase in the risk of ICU-acquired weakness.

### Pharmacological treatments in ARDS; a state-of-the-art update [^115Ji9iR]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Despite its high incidence and devastating outcomes, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) has no specific treatment, with effective therapy currently limited to minimizing potentially harmful ventilation and avoiding a positive fluid balance. ARDS is characterized by breakdown of the alveolar-capillary barrier, leading to flooding of the alveolar space producing the classical chest radiograph of bilateral pulmonary infiltrates. This non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema is associated with impaired oxygenation, as measured by the PaO 2 /FiO 2 (P/F) ratio, with a lower P/F ratio indicating more severe hypoxia. Acute lung injury (ALI) is defined as a P/F ratio < 300 mmHg (40kPa) and ARDS is a sub-group defined on the basis of more severely impaired oxygenation with a P/F ratio < 200 mmHg (26.7 kPa).

Since it was first described in 1967, and despite over 40 years of research, few pharmacological therapies have emerged for ARDS. We limited the search strategy for this state-of-the-art update review to recent randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses, as well as a review of promising potential future pharmacological therapies in ARDS in an adult setting.

Neuromuscular blockade

Lung protective ventilation can be achieved in the majority of patients without using neuromuscular blockade (NMB); however, initial small studies eliminating patient effort via skeletal muscle inhibition with NMB improved patient-ventilator synchrony, as evidenced by reduced airway pressures and improved chest wall compliance. Therefore, in the severely hypoxemic ARDS patient, NMB may permit lower-pressure, lower-tidal volume ventilation with a consequent reduction in ventilator-induced lung injury. These beneficial effects led to a multi-center, randomized, placebo-controlled trial to assess the effect of NMB upon mortality (Table 1). This showed that infusion with cisatracuriumbesylate within 48 hours of mechanical ventilation in patients with moderate ARDS improved 90-day survival. However, no difference was noted between the intervention and placebo groups until Day 20. The biological mechanism by which NMB improves late but not early outcome is unclear. While promising, the protective effect of neuromuscular blockade needs to be confirmed in a further phase 3 trial.

Analysis of outcomes

Mortality

Mortality (pooled 28 day, ICU and hospital mortality) was reported in all three RCTswith point estimates showing a reduction in mortality at each of these time points. However, in each of these RCT, the 95% CI for the risk ratio reached or crossed the no effect line. When mortality data from these RCTs were pooled in MA (with a total of 431 participants), the CI was narrowed to show a significant reduction in mortality at each of these time points. The risk ratios for 28 day, ICU and hospital mortality were 0.66, 0.70 and 0.72, respectively, suggesting a significant reduction in the risk of mortality with this intervention.

Although these results showed a good level of consistency and precision, there are important concerns over the risk of bias and indirectness in the contributing RCT. All three studies, which were conducted by the same team of investigators in France, have been criticised for the lack of effective blinding of caregivers to study group allocation. In two of the studies, no attempt was made to blind caregivers while, in the third, it is questionable whether blinding was effective. It has also been noted that there is considerable overlap of authorship of the most recent SR and the contributing RCT. One of the contributing RCTsincluded only patients with severe ARDS (P/F ratio < 20 kPa) within the first 48 hours, leading to our assessment of 'serious' indirectness of the findings for ARDS as a whole.

Length of stay

This was not reported in the included SR.

Quality of life

This was not reported in the included SR.

Economic data

This was not reported in the included SR.

Treatment harms

A key concern for the use of NMBA in ICU is the presumed risk of increased ICU-acquired weakness with their use. Although the risk of ICU-acquired weakness was not found to be significantly increased on MA (RR 1.08; 95% CI 0.83 to 1.41), these findings are severely limited by the lack of robust screening measures in two of the contributing RCT, and by the lack of follow-up beyond ICU discharge in the final RCT

Grade recommendation statement

We do not suggest using NMBAs for all patients with ARDS (GRADE Recommendation: weakly against). We suggest the use of cisatracurium besylate by continuous 48 hours infusion in patients suffering early moderate/severe ARDS (P/F < 20 kPa: GRADE Recommendation: weakly in favour).

### Neuromuscular blockers in early acute respiratory distress syndrome [^116PN5cj]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2010). Excellent credibility.

The study ACURASYS was published by Laurent Papazian and colleagues in 2010 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Acute respiratory distress syndrome. In the ACURASYS study, the trial question was: what is the role of cisatracurium in patients with severe ARDS? In the ACURASYS study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the ACURASYS study, the population was: 340 patients. The inclusion criteria were patients presenting to the ICU with severe ARDS beginning within the previous 48 hours. The key exclusion criteria were age < 18 years, lack of consent, continuous infusion of a neuromuscular blocking agent at enrollment, known pregnancy, increased ICP, severe chronic liver disease, or bone marrow transplantation or chemotherapy-induced neutropenia. In the ACURASYS study, the interventions were: n = 178 early neuromuscular blockade (using cisatracurium besylate for 48 hours) n = 162 placebo (matching placebo for 48 hours). In the ACURASYS study, the primary outcome was: borderline significant decrease in death at 90 days (31.6% vs. 40.7%; HR 0.68, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.98). In the ACURASYS study, the secondary outcomes were: borderline significant decrease in death at 28 days (23.7% vs. 33.3%; RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.51 to 1) Significant decrease in pneumothorax (4% vs. 11.7%; RR 0.34, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.78). In the ACURASYS study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in ICU-acquired paresis. In the ACURASYS study, the conclusion was: in patients presenting to the ICU with severe ARDS beginning within the previous 48 hours, early neuromuscular blockade was superior to placebo with respect to death at 90 days.

Supportive therapies

Neuromuscular blockade

In ARDS patients with a PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio lower than 150 mmHg early treatment with continuous infusion of cisatracurium for 48 h reduces 90-day mortality and barotrauma and increases the number of ventilator-free days and the number of days outside the ICU without increasing the risk of ICU-acquired weakness. The precise mechanism resulting in improved outcomes is not clear. In terms of lung mechanics, better synchrony may lead to more-uniform lung recruitment and improved compliance, gas exchange, and systemic oxygenation. With respect to lung inflammation, it is plausible that improved control of inspiratory volumes and pressures reduces volutrauma, while better control of expiratory volumes and pressures reduces atelectrauma; the result is less pulmonary and systemic inflammation. According to the study protocol, clinicians did not monitor the depth of paralysis with peripheral nerve stimulation, but rather when plateau pressures exceeded 32 cmH 2 O (for more than 10 min, despite increased sedation) an intravenous bolus of cisatracurium was administered. The outcome benefit for rescue therapy with neuromuscular blockade is applicable only to cisatracurium besylate and not to all neuromuscular blocking agents. Optimal dosing and monitoring strategies will need to be further studied.

### Early short course of neuromuscular blocking agents in patients with COVID-19 ARDS: a propensity score analysis [^113oBkoR]. Critical Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Since early 2020, SARS-CoV-2 infections have placed tremendous burden on patients and international healthcare services. A high proportion of diseased patients require hospitalization, and a small subset with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) become critically ill and require invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) for life-threatening respiratory failure. High mortality has been reported in this subpopulation, irrespective of survival benefits from established treatments, such as corticosteroids and IL-6 receptor antagonists.

Neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBAs) have been commonly used for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) to reduce patient–ventilator asynchrony and — in the context of severely damaged and poorly compliant lungs — to improve oxygenation, while minimizing the work of breathing and risks of barotrauma. International studies have confirmed the use of NMBAs in up to 26% of ARDS patients. Yet, conflicting results were provided by large randomized clinical trials, such as the ACURASYS and ROSE trials, and indication, efficacy, and safety on the use of NMBAs in such patients remain uncertain.

### Neuromuscular blocking agents in acute respiratory distress syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^117MNRAd]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

Conclusions

In summary, results of this review suggest that a 48-hour continuous infusion of cisatracurium besylate for patients with severe ARDS reduces 28-day, ICU, and hospital mortality, as well as barotrauma, without increasing the risk of ICU-acquired weakness. Although these findings were derived from a single group of investigators at multiple centers across France, further international multicenter trials maybe warranted to confirm the generalizability of these findings. Meanwhile, many clinicians have adopted NMBA therapy into their routine management of adult ARDS. Given that mortality is the critical outcome of interest in this setting, our findings provide new support for a short-term infusion of cisatracurium besylate for critically ill adults with severe ARDS.

Discussion

To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest, international observational study of patients with COVID-19 requiring mechanical ventilation to assess the impact of short-course NMBA treatment, commenced early during IMV, on 90-day in-hospital mortality. We found that NMBA use was common, specifically at European sites, and frequently applied in patients who presented hypercapnic and required higher levels of PEEP upon commencement of IMV. PS-matching analysis confirmed that early NMBA treatment did not result in lower mortality, while post hoc sensitivity analysis found increased mortality risk when NMBAs use was extended beyond 3 days. In addition, at 28 and 90 days, there were no between-group differences in days free of mechanical ventilation.

NMBAs are commonly used in critically ill patients who require IMV, but this practice has considerably changed throughout the years. In the 1980s, a survey from Great Britain reported NMBA administered in 90% of the patients on IMV, while in 2005 data from an international large cohort of mechanically ventilated patients reported NMBAs use merely in 13% of the patients. The most recent clinical practice guidelines by the Society of Critical Care Medicine specified various indications for the use of NMBA in critically ill adult patients, among those patients with ARDS and PaO 2 /FiO 2 < 150. In line with the original findings by Gainnier et al. demonstrating consistent oxygenation improvement in ARDS patients undergoing a 48-h course of NMBA, the confirmatory ACURASYS trial found that early administration of continuous cisatracurium for 48 h improved 90-day survival and reduced risk of barotrauma. However, subsequent results from the Reevaluation of Systemic Early Neuromuscular Blockade (ROSE) trial failed to show reductions in mortality. Meta-analyses emphasized potential limitations of those previous trials, i.e. heterogeneity in the use of sedation and prone positioning, selection bias, and crossover between treatment groups. Thus, to date, available evidence supports the use of NMBAs to reduce risks of barotrauma and to improve oxygenation, but without clear advantage in survival rate. ARDS caused by COVID-19 has broad similarities with historic ARDS caused by other etiologies, although pulmonary blood flow derangement and resulting pulmonary shunt seem to play a primary role in COVID-19 ARDS. As a result, various interventions previously employed for ARDS, such as prone position, ECMO, and NMBAs, were extensively applied in the COVID-19 population.

Uncertainties and research priorities

There are several areas of uncertainty that warrant further research. Little is known about long-term outcomes in ECMO survivors. Pooled data from existing studies suggest that ECMO survivors may have greater decrements in health-related quality of life than patients who were managed with conventional mechanical ventilation, although these findings are limited by small sample sizes and significant heterogeneity in outcome measures and timing of follow-up. It is crucial to understand whether increased survival comes with a potential increase in disability because this may have implications for patient preferences, cost effectiveness, and general utility of ECMO. Additionally, there are limited data regarding appropriate supportive measures for patients receiving ECMO, such as early mobilization and ventilator management. Further research is needed to understand if approaches to these aspects of care should differ from those used for patients who are treated with conventional mechanical ventilation. Finally, additional studies are needed to address the impact of ECMO on resource allocation in different settings and healthcare systems.

Question 3: Should Patients with ARDS Receive Neuromuscular Blockade?

Recommendation

We suggest using neuromuscular blockade in patients with early severe ARDS (conditional recommendation, low certainty)

Background

NMBAs are a commonly used adjunctive therapy for patients with ARDS. The mechanism of benefit is unclear, but likely involves decreasing ventilator-induced lung injury via a reduction in patient–ventilator dyssynchrony in addition to reducing oxygen consumption, inflammation, and alveolar fluid. NMBAs were not addressed in the 2017 guidelines. Since that time, increasing use and evolving evidence prompted the committee to evaluate NMBAs for the new guidelines.

### Management of severe acute respiratory distress syndrome: a primer [^114BdiCA]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Neuromuscular blockade

Neuromuscular blockade (NMB) improves oxygenation via several mechanisms. Paralysis decreases oxygen consumption, eliminates ventilator dyssynchrony, and improves thoracopulmonary compliance. The ACURASYS trial in 2010 demonstrated a mortality benefit with 48 h of NMB with cisatracurium in patients with moderate-to-severe ARDS (P/F < 150). The larger multicenter ROSE trial in 2019 found no significant mortality benefit using NMB in moderate-to-severe ARDS. However, patients already receiving NMB at the time of enrollment were excluded and it is possible that a subset of patients still benefit from NMB when deemed beneficial by clinician judgment. Additionally, in contrast to ACURASYS, the ROSE control arm received less sedation than the NMB group, which has been previously associated with improved ICU outcomes. While it is evident that NMB improves oxygenation, it is controversial whether it confers a mortality benefit.

Prolonged use of NMB increases the risk of neuromuscular weakness and muscle loss, pressure injuries, and deep vein thromboses, and requires deep sedation which can increase delirium and neurocognitive impairment and decrease ventilator-free days. When using NMB agents, train-of-four (TOF) monitoring may be used to titrate to the lowest effective dose. Deep sedation is also required during NMB and may be titrated using bispectral index (BIS) to a goal of 40 to 60.

### Severe community-acquired pneumonia: timely management measures in the first 24 hours [^116r6ADD]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Pneumonia is the most common cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and as detailed in Table 1 accounts for a large proportion of participants in multiple ARDS trials. Lung-protective ventilation with low tidal volumes of 6 ml/kg of predicted body weight and limitation of the driving pressure (tidal volume divided by respiratory system compliance) after intubation have been associated with reduced mortality (Table 1). The impact of limiting tidal volumes on mortality is greatest at the start of mechanical ventilation. A patient-level meta-analysis of three large multicentre randomised trials suggested that higher positive-end expiratory pressure may improve survival, although subsequent systematic reviews have not found a similar association (Table 1). Early initiation of a 48-hour infusion of cisatracurium for neuromuscular blockade for patients with severe hypoxaemia (PaO 2 /FIO 2 < 150 mmHg) lowers mortality, as does early prone positioning (Table 1).

Early corticosteroids

While systemic corticosteroids attenuate the inflammatory response in CAP, recent data on their role are conflicting. In a multicentre randomised controlled trial of 785 patients, 386 of whom had severe CAP as defined by PSI classes IV and V, Blum et al. found that corticosteroids shortened the time to clinical stability. In another trial of 120 patients with severe CAP and C-reactive protein levels > 150 mg/L, Torres et al. found that corticosteroids decreased treatment failure, although predominantly by halting radiographic progression rather than improving patient-centric outcomes. Three recent meta-analyses came to different conclusions, with two analyses suggesting that corticosteroids decrease mortality in severe CAP (Table 1) and one analysis finding no impact on mortality. The latter review, however, suggested that corticosteroids are safe, and may reduce the risk of ARDS, lengths of hospital and ICU stay, and time to clinical stability. These meta-analyses are limited by the heterogeneity of the included studies, and in particular are skewed by an outlying randomised trial by Confalonieri et al. which found that hydrocortisone reduced mortality from 38% to 0%. More data are thus needed before corticosteroids become routine treatments for severe CAP.

### The standard of care of patients with ARDS: ventilatory settings and rescue therapies for refractory hypoxemia [^111u2f9X]. Intensive Care Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose

Severe ARDS is often associated with refractory hypoxemia, and early identification and treatment of hypoxemia is mandatory. For the management of severe ARDS ventilator settings, positioning therapy, infection control, and supportive measures are essential to improve survival.

Methods and results

A precise definition of life-threating hypoxemia is not identified. Typical clinical determinations are: arterial partial pressure of oxygen < 60 mmHg and/or arterial oxygenation < 88% and/or the ratio of PaO 2 /FIO 2 < 100. For mechanical ventilation specific settings are recommended: limitation of tidal volume (6 ml/kg predicted body weight), adequate high PEEP (> 12 cmH 2 O), a recruitment manoeuvre in special situations, and a 'balanced' respiratory rate (20–30/min). Individual bedside methods to guide PEEP/recruitment (e.g. transpulmonary pressure) are not (yet) available. Prone positioning [early (≤ 48 hrs after onset of severe ARDS) and prolonged (repetition of 16-hr-sessions)] improves survival. An advanced infection management/control includes early diagnosis of bacterial, atypical, viral and fungal specimen (blood culture, bronchoalveolar lavage), and of infection sources by CT scan, followed by administration of broad-spectrum anti-infectives. Neuromuscular blockage (Cisatracurium ≤ 48 hrs after onset of ARDS), as well as an adequate sedation strategy (score guided) is an important supportive therapy. A negative fluid balance is associated with improved lung function and the use of hemofiltration might be indicated for specific indications.

Conclusions

A specific standard of care is required for the management of severe ARDS with refractory hypoxemia.

### Early paralysis for the management of ARDS [^115fBRJj]. Respiratory Care (2016). Low credibility.

The use of neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBAs) early in the development of ARDS has been a strategy of interest for many years. The use of NMBAs with a concomitant deep sedation strategy can increase oxygenation and possibly decrease mortality when used in the early stages of ARDS. The mechanism by which this occurs is unclear but probably involves a combination of factors, such as improving patient-ventilator synchrony, decreasing oxygen consumption, and decreasing the systemic inflammatory response associated with ARDS. The use of NMBA and deep sedation for these patients is not without consequence. This discussion describes the rationale and evidence behind the use of NMBAs in the setting of ARDS.

### Early neuromuscular blockade in the acute respiratory distress syndrome [^116j5Q1b]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2019). Excellent credibility.

The study ROSE was published by National Heart and colleagues in 2019 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Acute respiratory distress syndrome. In the ROSE study, the trial question was: what is the role of early continuous neuromuscular blockade in patients with ARDS receiving mechanical ventilation? In the ROSE study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the ROSE study, the population was: 1006 patients (446 female, 560 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with moderate-to-severe ARDS receiving high PEEP mechanical ventilation. The key exclusion criteria were continuous neuromuscular blockade at enrollment; chronic respiratory failure; severe chronic liver disease; expected duration of mechanical ventilation < 48 hours. In the ROSE study, the interventions were: n = 501 intervention (48-hour continuous neuromuscular blockade with cisatracurium and concomitant deep sedation) n = 505 control (usual care with lighter sedation targets). In the ROSE study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in in-hospital death from any cause at 90 days (42.5% vs. 42.8%; ARD -0.3, 95% CI -6.4 to 5.9). In the ROSE study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in the rate of in-hospital death by 28 days (36.7% vs. 37%; ARD -0.3, 95% CI -6.3 to 5.7) No significant difference in days free of ventilation at day 28 (9.6 days vs. 9.9 days; AD -0.3 days, 95% CI -1.7 to 1) No significant difference in days not in hospital at day 28 (5.7 days vs. 5.9 days; AD -0.2 days, 95% CI -1.1 to 0.8). In the ROSE study, the safety outcomes were: no significant differences in in-hospital recall of paralysis, ICU acquired weakness, serious adverse events. significant difference in serious cardiovascular events (2.8% vs. 0.8%). In the ROSE study, the conclusion was: in patients with moderate-to-severe ARDS receiving high PEEP mechanical ventilation, intervention was not superior to control with respect to a in-hospital death from any cause at 90 days.

### Ventilator-associated pneumonia and ICU mortality in severe ARDS patients ventilated according to a lung-protective strategy [^113ErA9d]. Critical Care (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) still carries a high mortality rate. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is a complication of ARDS that may increase the risk of multiple organ failure and death. However, the impact of nosocomial pneumonia on mortality in mechanically ventilated patients remains controversial, and few data are available on mortality in ARDS patients who experience VAP. Moreover, many of the studies related to VAP in ARDS patients were performed before the use of lung-protective mechanical-ventilation strategies. Modifications in mechanical-ventilation settings may have modified the epidemiology and outcomes of VAP in patients with severe ARDS.

Here, we report the results of an epidemiologic study performed in all patients included in a multicenter randomized, placebo-controlled double-blind trial conducted to determine whether briefly administering the neuromuscular blocking agent (NMBA) cisatracurium besylate early in the course of severe ARDS improved the clinical outcomes. The results of this therapeutic intervention have been reported elsewhere. The main objective of this prospective study was to determine whether bacterial VAP complicating severe ARDS was associated with ICU death in patients receiving lung-protective mechanical ventilation. We also determined the incidence and risk factors of VAP.

PHARMACOLOGIC TREATMENT

Conservative Fluid Management

Hypervolemia can cause pulmonary edema with resultant hypoxemia. Randomized trials comparing liberal to conservative fluid management strategies in ARDS have confirmed better outcomes with conservative fluid management, including shortened duration of mechanical ventilation, and decreased ICU and hospital length of stay. – The Fluids and Catheters Treatment Trial (FACTT) confirmed that a conservative fluid management strategy for ARDS reduced net fluid balance and improved oxygenation and ventilator-free days. A subsequent study with less strict fluid protocol (FACTT Lite) also confirmed improved outcomes. Additional studies confirm that early diuretic use and conservative fluid management are associated with decreased mortality in ARDS. – Diuresis should be considered in ARDS patients without contraindications.

Neuromuscular Blockade

As with other rescue strategies for severe hypoxemia, neuromuscular blockade is associated with improved oxygenation, but no improvement in survival based on the most recent systematic review and meta-analysis of 5 RCTs. The French multicenter ACURASYS trial over a decade ago reported significantly lower mortality with a 48-hour infusion of cisatracurium in addition to deep sedation. The multicenter Reevaluation of Systemic Early Neuromuscular Blockade (ROSE) trial was stopped early for futility after enrollment of 1006 moderate/severe ARDS patients and reported no difference in 90-day mortality (42.5% vs. 42.8%). Based on these results, neuromuscular blockade can be considered in ARDS patients with severe refractory hypoxemia or ventilator dyssynchrony that cannot be managed with sedation alone (Fig. 2). Neuromuscular blockade is not required for prone positioning.

### Neuromuscular blocking agents in acute respiratory distress syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^117Kpdki]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

Statistical analysis

We pooled data by using RevMan 5.1 and random-effects models, applying inverse variance weighting and the methods of DerSimonian and Laird. We generated summary estimates of relative risk (RR) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MDs) for continuous outcomes, each with associated 95% confidence intervals (CIs). To investigate the effect of treatment on oxygenation, we analyzed early changes in PaO 2 /FiO 2 at 24, 48, and 72 hours after randomization. To assess for effects on duration of ventilation, we planned to compare VFDs at day 28. Because of the controversy surround VFDs as an outcome, we conducted post hoc comparisons of duration of ventilation in survivors, and all patients. We assessed for heterogeneity between studies by using the Mantel-Haenszel χ 2 statistic (P < 0.01 indicating substantial heterogeneity) and the I 2 statistic (> 50% indicating substantial heterogeneity). We had too few studies to assess for publication bias by using a funnel plot or conventional statistical methods.

The review protocol stipulated a number of exploratory analyses to assess potential reasons for differing results (if any) across studies. We hypothesized that two factors might generate estimates of greater benefit: high or unclear risk of bias (versus low), and more-severe hypoxemia at baseline (PO 2/ /FiO 2 < 100, versus 100 to 200). To inform current guidelines, we also sought to estimate the effect of NMBA specifically among sepsis patients. With RevMan 5.1 software, subgroup analyses were conducted by pooling RRs for subgroups in each trial. Last, we planned to test the robustness of our primary (mortality) results in sensitivity analyses by using fixed-effects models and by using two alternative statistical metrics: odds ratios and risk differences. To estimate the number of adults with ARDS that must receive NMBA therapy to save one additional life (number need to treat), we assumed a mortality rate of 40% in the absence of NMBA therapy, in accordance with mortality rates in current trials.

### Neuromuscular blocking agents for acute respiratory distress syndrome: an updated meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^1164SEW9]. Respiratory Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Study strengths and limitations

The strength of our study is that the newest published multiple center RCT was included. Several limitations of our meta-analysis should be concerned. Although there was no significantly statistic heterogeneity between studies in most analytic models, it is important to note the unneglectable clinical heterogeneity. Different ARDS definition criteria, type of neuromuscular blocking agents, dosage regimens, mechanical ventilation strategies, and various adjunct treatments may bias the results. In addition, only six studies were eligible, and we cannot perform subgroup analysis according different important variables. Furthermore, the small sample sizes of four studies make our results are mainly depend on the ACURASYS trial and ROSE trial.

Implications for clinical practice and further researches

In the present study, we found NMBAs use is beneficial for reverse of hypoxemia and may be associated with decreased shorter-term mortality (21~28 days mortality). But they had no significantly statistical effects on long-term mortality. Along with the higher risk of serious cardiovascular events among patients received NMBAs, we do not suggest routinely use of NMBAs in all patients with ARDS. Severe ARDS patients with patient–ventilator dyssynchronies, or who are vulnerable to ventilator-induced injury may benefit from NMBAs use. Thus, we think NMBAs could be used for improvement of oxygenation in patients with severe ARDS. Additionally, further studies should focus on the following major topics. Firstly, in recent years, different subgroups or phenotypes of ARDS have been pay attention to. Patients who are response to NMBAs therapy should be identified in further studies. Then, the optimal dose, time and duration of NMBAs remain unclear. The ACURASYS and ROSE studies used high dosages of cisatracurium (37.5 mg/h). Clinical assessment should be used in combination with Train-of-four (TOF) to titrate the optimal NMBAs' dose. The median time from ARDS diagnosis to NMBAs use is different between the ACURASYS trial and ROSE trial (16 h vs 7.6 h). So far, there have been no studies focusing on effects of different initiation time. Although all prospective studies limit NMBAs use within 48 h of ARDS set, there is significant heterogeneity between centers in clinical practices.

### Neuromuscular blocking agents for ARDS: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116W2V58]. Respiratory Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Studies evaluating neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBAs) in the management of ARDS have produced inconsistent results in terms of their effect on mortality. The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to evaluate differences in mortality comparing subjects with ARDS who received NMBA to those who received placebo or usual care.

Methods

We searched Ovid, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, Cochrane, Scopus, and Web of Science for randomized controlled trials evaluating administration of NMBAs in subjects with ARDS.

Results

We included 6 studies (N = 1,558 subjects) from 1,814 abstracts identified by our search strategy. The use of early, continuous-infusion NMBAs reduces the risk of short-term (ie, 21-28-d) mortality (relative risk 0.71 [95% CI 0.52–0.98], P = 0.030, I² = 60%) in subjects with ARDS but does not reduce the risk of long-term (ie, 90-d) mortality (relative risk 0.81 [95% CI 0.64–1.04], P = 0.10, I² = 54%). NMBAs decreased the risk of barotrauma (relative risk 0.55 [95% CI 0.35–0.85], P = 0.008, I² = 0%) and pneumothorax (relative risk 0.46 [95% CI 0.28–0.77], P = 0.003, I² = 0%) compared to control.

Conclusions

In subjects with ARDS, early use of NMBAs improves oxygenation, reduces the incidence of ventilator-induced lung injury, and decreases 21-28-d mortality, but it does not improve 90-d mortality. NMBAs should be considered for select patients with moderate-to-severe ARDS for short durations.

### To block or not: updates in neuromuscular blockade in acute respiratory distress syndrome [^116vsSDs]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective: To review and evaluate neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBAs) in critically ill patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Data Sources: A literature search utilizing PubMed was performed (January 1991 to January 2020) using the following search terms: (neuromuscular blocking agents OR neuromuscular blockade OR cisatracurium OR rocuronium OR vecuronium OR pancuronium OR atracurium) AND * acute respiratory distress syndrome OR acute lung injury). Publications in English were evaluated. Study Selection and Data Extraction: Relevant clinical studies in humans were considered. Data Synthesis: Although NMBAs have been used for decades in the setting of ARDS, questions regarding mortality benefit remain. Early NMBA, within 48 hours of lung injury, have been historically used in critically ill patients with ARDS to aid in increasing alveolar recruitment, improving patient-ventilator synchrony, and promoting oxygenation by the prevention of contraction of respiratory muscles. Until recently, the literature showed an improvement in 90-day adjusted mortality. However, recent literature has demonstrated the lack of a mortality benefit. The continued receipt of NMBAs, with no clear benefit, could potentially lead to increased costs, skin breakdown, corneal abrasions, venous thromboembolisms, intensive care unit acquired weakness, and awareness with inappropriate sedation. Relevance to Patient Care and Clinical Practice: This review aims at discussing the preferred NMBA based on mechanism of action and reviews specific clinical trial data for the use of NMBAs in ARDS, clinical implications of these trial data, complications for the use of NMBAs, and needed future directions. Conclusions: The mortality benefit of NMBAs in ARDS has contradicting evidence with potentially serious adverse effects and notable controversies.

### Neuromuscular blocking agents in acute respiratory distress syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^111Mxc2R]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

In contrast to the prior literature in asthma, we reviewed randomized trials of patients with severe ARDS. Our review found no apparent increase in ICU-acquired weakness with cisatracurium therapy. The definition of this outcome in two of the three trials was based simply on clinically detectable quadriparesis, which may lack both sensitivity and specificity; however, the most recent and largest trial used the validated Medical Research Council score, and found identical risk of ICU-acquired weakness whether or not patients received NMBA therapy. Future studies could use the same measure over a more protracted period of time, and supplement these assessments with electrophysiologic testing.

The strengths of this review include adherence to a predetermined review protocol, a comprehensive literature search, duplicate independent judgments about study eligibility and risk of bias, and collaboration with authors of the primary studies after the review protocol had been established.

Four noteworthy limitations exist. First, it is conceivable that incomplete blinding in two trials might have led to inflated estimates of benefit. Second, we were unable to assess for publication bias. Third, it is uncertain whether the results of this review are applicable to cisatracurium besylate only, to all benzylisoquinolone agents, or to all neuromuscular blocking agents and, in addition, we were unable to investigate optimal dosing strategies. Finally, these findings may not be applicable to centers in which the care of adults with ARDS differs significantly from the care provided in France, where the 20 centers involved in these studies were located.

Current clinical management of critically ill adults with ARDS commands further direction on the role for NMBA therapy, which has become an important part of the armamentarium for severe hypoxemia. In the three recent clinical trials of high PEEP for the management of adult acute lung injury and ARDS, in which NMBA therapy was not protocolized, more than one half of 2,299 patients received neuromuscular blockade at some time during their study, for a median of 2.5 days. Interestingly, during a decade of randomized trials comparing low-tidal-volume ventilation with traditional tidal volumes, significantly more patients managed with low-tidal-volume strategies received NMBA therapy (RR, 1.37; 95% CI, 1.04 to 1.82; P = 0.030), suggesting that NMBA may already play a very important role in lung-protective ventilation.

### Neuromuscular blocking agents for acute respiratory distress syndrome: an updated meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^112ma97B]. Respiratory Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Three meta-analysis published separately in 2012, 2013 and 2018 reported NMBAs were associated with improved oxygenation and a lower risk of mortality and barotrauma. However, these pooled results were affected mainly by the ACURASYS trial. Our meta-analysis updated the results with the latest ROSE trial, which included more patients than all previous published studies. However, our results are different from the results of the previous meta-analysis. There are several possible explanations for this result. The most important factor may be the difference in sedation levels. Patients in the control group received light sedation according to the current guidelines, in the ROSE trial, however, those patients received deep sedation in other previous published studies. It has been reported that deep sedation use in critically ill patients is independently associated with delayed extubation and increased mortality. Moreover, Akoumianaki et al. proposed a new mechanism for ventilator dyssynchrony in patients with ARDS in 2013, called reverse triggering. And deep sedation level may increase the incidence of reverse triggering, and the latter is associated with poor prognosis in patients with ARDS. In addition, different median time from ARDS diagnosis to randomization, percentage of prone positioning, higher PEEP and other treatment strategies also need to be taken into consideration.

Our study showed that patients in the NMBAs group had a significant higher PaO2/FiO2 at 48 h and 72 h, and reduced Pplat and PEEP at 72 h. Although the difference of these parameters did not reach statistical significance before 48 h, but the trend toward improved results in patients who received NMBAs from 48 h to 72 h is clearly. These results indicate NMBAs therapy attenuate early hypoxemia in adult patients with ARDS. Additionally, NMBAs related complications has also been a focus of concern, especially the ICU-obtained weakness. In the present study, we did not find short-term use of NMBAs could increase the incidence of ICU-obtained weakness. However, the diagnosis of ICU-obtained weakness is inconsistent and subjective and many other factors can affect the incidence of ICU-acquired weakness. Besides, the ROSE trial found use of cisatracurium is associated with a higher risk of serious cardiovascular events. The authors speculated this may be associated with the use of deep sedation. In addition, accumulation of laudanosine may increase the incidence of bradycardia and hypotension.

Domain 8: Neuromuscular blocking agents

Question 8.1: Does the routine use of a continuous infusion of neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBA) in patients with moderate-to-severe ARDS not due to COVID-19 or moderate-to-severe ARDS due to COVID-19 reduce mortality?

Background

The administration of NMBA to mechanically ventilated patients with ARDS reduces the work of breathing and patient–ventilator asynchronyand may affect outcome. However, prolonged use of NMBA is also associated with neuromuscular weakness and requires deep sedation, which itself can result in adverse outcomes. More than a decade ago, the ACURASYS trial reported that the early administration of a 48-h infusion of NMBA in patients with moderate-to-severe ARDS (PaO 2 /FiO 2 < 150 mmHg with PEEP ≥ 5) resulted in lower mortality than a strategy of deep sedation without routine NMBA use, after an adjusted analysis. Three other smaller trials with similar inclusion criteria and treatment protocols showed benefit with routine NMBA use. However, ICU practices have evolved since these trials, with emphasis on lighter sedation and earlier return to spontaneous breathing.

In the recent ROSE trial, which randomized patients with moderate-to-severe ARDS to a 48h continuous infusion of NMBA with concomitant deep sedation (intervention group) or to a usual-care approach without routine neuromuscular blockade and with lighter sedation targets (control group), there was no significant difference in mortality at 90 days. There has been an increased use of NMBA infusions in patients with COVID-19 ARDS who are mechanically ventilated, most commonly to abolish vigorous spontaneous efforts and decrease the generation of high transpulmonary pressures that could aggravate self-inflicted lung injury or asynchronies. However, randomized trials on NMBA use in patients with COVID-19 are lacking. Given that the ROSE trial excluded a significant number of patients already receiving NMBA, the benefit of early continuous NMBA remains unclear.

### Clinical practice guidelines for sustained neuromuscular blockade in the adult critically ill patient [^111CYPoy]. Critical Care Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) neuromuscular blockade (NMBA) in adults — key findings include that pooling results across trials showed that a 48-hour cisatracurium infusion consistently reduced the risk of death at 28 days and at hospital discharge, reduced barotrauma, and did not increase intensive care unit (ICU)-acquired weakness; assuming a baseline mortality rate of 45% for ARDS patients, eight patients would have to be treated with a 48-hour cisatracurium infusion to save one additional life. In a subsequent study, 24 of 48 patients with ARDS and sepsis received vecuronium and 24 were assigned to control, and compared with the control group, the vecuronium group had decreased mortality. In the largest trial reported to date, an additional bolus of study drug was administered when plateau airway pressure exceeded 32 cm H2O, and current evidence might be extrapolated to support the use of NMBA therapy in adults with ARDS whenever plateau airway pressures exceed 30–35 cm H2O. Neuromuscular blockade has been linked to increased risk of ICU-acquired weakness, which is cited as a deterrent to use in ARDS.

### Guidelines on the management of acute respiratory distress syndrome [^1164SS7C]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2019). High credibility.

The Faculty of Intensive Care Medicine and Intensive Care Society Guideline Development Group have used GRADE methodology to make the following recommendations for the management of adult patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The British Thoracic Society supports the recommendations in this guideline. Where mechanical ventilation is required, the use of low tidal volumes (< 6 ml/kg ideal body weight) and airway pressures (plateau pressure < 30 cmH 2 O) was recommended. For patients with moderate/severe ARDS (PF ratio < 20 kPa), prone positioning was recommended for at least 12 hours per day. By contrast, high frequency oscillation was not recommended and it was suggested that inhaled nitric oxide is not used. The use of a conservative fluid management strategy was suggested for all patients, whereas mechanical ventilation with high positive end-expiratory pressure and the use of the neuromuscular blocking agent cisatracurium for 48 hours was suggested for patients with ARDS with ratio of arterial oxygen partial pressure to fractional inspired oxygen (PF) ratios less than or equal to 27 and 20 kPa, respectively. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was suggested as an adjunct to protective mechanical ventilation for patients with very severe ARDS. In the absence of adequate evidence, research recommendations were made for the use of corticosteroids and extracorporeal carbon dioxide removal.

### An observational study of the efficacy of cisatracurium compared with vecuronium in patients with or at risk for acute respiratory distress syndrome [^111a87bs]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Rationale

The neuromuscular blocking agent cisatracurium may improve mortality for patients with moderate-to-severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Other neuromuscular blocking agents, such as vecuronium, are commonly used and have different mechanisms of action, side effects, cost, and availability in the setting of drug shortages.

Objectives

To determine whether cisatracurium is associated with improved outcomes when compared with vecuronium in patients at risk for and with ARDS.

Methods

Using a nationally representative database, patients who were admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of ARDS or an ARDS risk factor, received mechanical ventilation, and were treated with a continuous infusion of neuromuscular blocking agent for at least 2 days within 2 days of hospital admission were included. Patients were stratified into two groups: those who received cisatracurium or vecuronium. Propensity matching was used to balance both patient- and hospital-specific factors. Outcomes included hospital mortality, duration of mechanical ventilation, ICU and hospital duration, and discharge location.

Measurements and Main Results

Propensity matching successfully balanced all covariates for 3,802 patients (1,901 per group). There was no significant difference in mortality (odds ratio, 0.932; P = 0.40) or hospital days (-0.66 d; P = 0.411) between groups. However, patients treated with cisatracurium had fewer ventilator days (-1.01 d; P = 0.005) and ICU days (-0.98 d; P = 0.028) but were equally likely to be discharged home (odds ratio, 1.19; P = 0.056).

Conclusions

When compared with vecuronium, cisatracurium was not associated with a difference in mortality but was associated with improvements in other clinically important outcomes. These data suggest that cisatracurium may be the preferred neuromuscular blocking agent for patients at risk for and with ARDS.

### Neuromuscular blockade in patients with ARDS: a rapid practice guideline [^112mtnSd]. Intensive Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

The aim of this Intensive Care Medicine Rapid Practice Guideline (ICM-RPG) is to formulate an evidence-based guidance for the use of neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBA) in adults with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The panel comprised 20 international clinical experts from 12 countries, and 2 patient representatives. We adhered to the methodology for trustworthy clinical practice guidelines and followed a strict conflict of interest policy. We convened panelists through teleconferences and web-based discussions. Guideline experts from the guidelines in intensive care, development, and evaluation Group provided methodological support. Two content experts provided input and shared their expertise with the panel but did not participate in drafting the final recommendations. We followed the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach to assess the certainty of evidence and grade recommendations and suggestions. We used the evidence to decision framework to generate recommendations. The panel provided input on guideline implementation and monitoring, and suggested future research priorities. The overall certainty in the evidence was low. The ICM-RPG panel issued one recommendation and two suggestions regarding the use of NMBAs in adults with ARDS. Current evidence does not support the early routine use of an NMBA infusion in adults with ARDS of any severity. It favours avoiding a continuous infusion of NMBA for patients who are ventilated using a lighter sedation strategy. However, for patients who require deep sedation to facilitate lung protective ventilation or prone positioning, and require neuromuscular blockade, an infusion of an NMBA for 48 h is a reasonable option.

### The use of a neuromuscular blocking agent could significantly decrease mortality in moderate-to-severe ARDS patients: is moderate ARDS the best indication for neuromuscular blocking agents [^115F7Kwx]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

We read with interest the recent meta-analysis by Chang et al. who investigated the role of neuromuscular blocking agent (NMBA) use in moderate-to-severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and discuss the potential mechanisms involved in the identified improvements due to the use of NMBA in ARDS. They conclude that the use of NMBAs could significantly decrease mortality in moderate-to-severe ARDS patients and decrease the incidence of barotrauma during mechanical ventilation. We would like to make some comments. Firstly, expert opinion challenges the conclusions of Chang et al. suggesting that NMBA use should be limited to the most hypoxemic patients (PaO2/FiO2 ratio < 120 mmHg, based on the subgroup analysis of the ACURASYS study) and not to moderate ARDS. The same authors also recommend that, at the early phase of mild or moderate ARDS, spontaneous breathing should be preserved. Chang et al. note that NMBAs prevent patient-initiated generation of high volumes and active exhalation, facilitate patient-ventilator synchrony, provide protection from ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI), and ultimately reduce mortality in patients with moderate-to-severe ARDS. The beneficial effects of NMBAs likely include not only abolition of patient-ventilator asynchronies, better lung recruitment, and decrease of VILI, but also less oxygen consumption and possible anti-inflammatory effects. In addition, NMBAs are also reported to directly alleviate pulmonary and systemic inflammatory progression. Other authors demonstrated that cisatracurium infusion in ARDS patients increased the end-expiratory transpulmonary pressure, contributing to the reduction of atelectrauma and expiratory derecruitment. We see that the conclusions of Chang et al. that the use of NMBAs could significantly decrease mortality in moderate-to-severe ARDS patients and decrease the incidence of barotrauma during mechanical ventilation are not the recommendations of the experts focusing upon the most hypoxemic patients. This message seems crucial to us, considering the numerous side effects of NMBAs.

### What is the optimal approach to analyse ventilator-free days? A simulation study [^111xkdLA]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Real datasets

Four datasets, ranging in sample sizes from 213 to nearly 900 patients, were reanalysed.

First, the LIVE study (NCT02149589), a multicentre RCT, compared personalised mechanical ventilation strategies against traditional methods in ARDS patients. While the intention-to-treat analysis (ITT) of LIVE showed no significant impact on 90-day survival, a post-hoc analysis indicated potential benefits of personalised strategies when subphenotypes were accurately identified. Therefore, for simplicity, the current reanalysis applied the aforementioned statistical models only in patients with correctly classified subphenotypes. Second, we conducted a reanalysis of patients previously enrolled in the ARMA trial (NCT00000579), comparing ventilation with low vs. traditional tidal volume in ARDS patients. The ITT analysis of the ARMA trial revealed significant effects on mortality and VFDs. Third, the multicentre randomised ACURASYS (NCT00299650) compared cisatracurium to placebo in patients with severe ARDS. The ITT analysis demonstrated a significant reduction in 90-day mortality and an improvement in VFDs with cisatracurium. Finally, the COVIDICUS trial (NCT04344730) compared high-dose dexamethasone and oxygenation strategies with standard of care dexamethasone in severe COVID-19-related acute hypoxemic respiratory failure patients. Only the ventilated subgroup of COVIDICUS was included in our reanalysis. The ITT analysis indicated no significant impact on 60-day survival or VFDs in the primary trial.

All statistical analyses were performed using R Core version 4.4.1. Further details can be found in the Additional file 1.

Methodologic quality of trials

Cisatracurium besylate was associated with lower risk of death at 28 days (RR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.50 to 0.87; P = 0.003; I² = 0; Figure 2), at ICU discharge (RR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.55 to 0.89; P = 0.004; I 2, 0; Figure 2), and at hospital discharge (RR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.58 to 0.91; P = 0.005; I² = 0; Figure 2). Assuming a mortality rate of 40% in the absence of cisatracurium therapy at each of these time points, these pooled estimates suggest a number needed to treat of seven patients (95% CI, 5 to 19) to save one additional life at 28 days; eight patients (95% CI, 4 to 31) to save one additional life at ICU discharge; and nine patients (95% CI, 6 to 27) for hospital mortality (Table 3).

### ARDS subphenotypes: understanding a heterogeneous syndrome [^114ETTPM]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Physiologic Phenotyping for Prognostic Enrichment

Risk stratification of ARDS patients is not a new strategy. The Berlin definition itself stratifies ARDS into three subgroups (Table 2) according to the degree of hypoxemia (mild, moderate, and severe), and mortality increases as the PaO 2 :FiO 2 ratio decreases. The advantage of this approach is that the PaO 2 :FiO 2 ratio is available in all patients with ARDS and does not require expert interpretation or subjective clinical assessment. Multiple large clinical ARDS trials have used the PaO 2 :FiO 2 ratio for prognostic enrichment. For example, the ACURASYS trial of early continuous neuromuscular blockade, the PROSEVA trial of prone positioning, and the ROSE trial reevaluating early continuous neuromuscular blockade all targeted patients with moderate-to-severe ARDS (PaO 2 :FiO 2 ratio < 150 mmHg). All three of these trials had mortality endpoints, and all three had mortality rates in the control arms that exceeded 40%.

Table 2
The Berlin Definition of ARDS categorizes patients according to the severity of their oxygenation deficit; increasing severity is associated with increased mortality

In addition to the PaO 2 :FiO 2 ratio, several other physiologic variables are known to predict poor outcomes in ARDS. Dead space fraction, ventilatory ratio (a simple bedside index of impaired ventilation), and driving pressure (a measurement of respiratory system compliance) are all independently associated with poor outcomes in ARDS and more routine measurement of these variables could improve prognostic enrichment in clinical trials and risk prediction in clinical practice.

One limitation of using these physiologic measurements, however, is that these variables can rapidly change. The application of higher positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), for example, could rapidly move a patient from one subgroup of ARDS severity to another, or a patient who aspirates at the time of intubation may develop severe hypoxemia that improves within hours. Perhaps more fundamentally, common physiologic characteristics in most cases do not capture important differences in biology between ARDS patients. A patient with transfusion-associated ARDS may have the same PaO 2 :FiO 2 ratio or driving pressure as a patient with ARDS from H1N1 influenza, but their underlying pathophysiology may be very different, and they do not have the same risk of poor outcomes. Indeed, the Berlin definition of ARDS is far from perfect as a predictor of mortality, with an area under the curve of only 0.577.

### Neuromuscular blocking agents for acute respiratory distress syndrome: an updated meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^114JhPun]. Respiratory Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Backgrounds

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a life-threatening condition characterized by refractory acute hypoxemia. It is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in intensive care unit (ICU). A number of interventions have been proposed in the past decade; however, few of them obtained strong recommendation. Only lung-protective mechanical ventilation strategy has been proven beneficial for prognosis of these patients. Neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBAs) may be a useful therapeutic strategy in patients with ARDS. The ARDS et Curarisation Systematique (ACURASYS) trial conducted in 2010 found early administration of a 48-h infusion of NMBA was associated with a lower risk of death in patients with moderate-to-severe ARDS. It is important to realize that patients in the control group in this study received deep sedation, and this is inconsistent with the current guidelines. A meta-analysis including 5 studies systematically reviewed the effects of NMBAs on ARDS. They concluded the application of NMBAs could reduce the mortality of patients with moderate-to-severe ARDS. However, the results of this meta-analysis are mainly affected by the ACURASYS trial. Based on the limited evidence and potential adverse events, NMBAs is only weakly recommended in the current guidelines. A new multi-center randomized control study (Reevaluation of Systemic Early Neuromuscular Blockade [ROSE] trial) just published recently. Thus, the main aim of this study is to investigate the effects of NMBAs in moderate-to-severe ARDS by an update meta-analysis.

### Early treatment of severe acute respiratory distress syndrome [^1136oW3Z]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is defined by acute diffuse inflammatory lung injury invoked by a variety of systemic or pulmonary insults. Despite medical progress in management, mortality remains 27% to 45%. Patients with ARDS should be managed with low tidal volume ventilation. Permissive hypercapnea is well tolerated. Conservative fluid strategy can reduce ventilator and hospital days in patients without shock. Prone positioning and neuromuscular blockers reduce mortality in some patients. Early management of ARDS is relevant to emergency medicine. Identifying ARDS patients who should be transferred to an extracorporeal membrane oxygenation center is an important task for emergency providers.

### Neuromuscular blocking agents for acute respiratory distress syndrome: how did we get conflicting results? [^113wknkA]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Letter

Except for neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBAs), pharmacologic therapies studied for ARDS have not demonstrated mortality benefit. By improving ventilator synchrony, NMBAs reduce ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) and aid in lung recruitment, thereby improving oxygenation. NMBAs exert their benefit in ARDS by decreasing systemic inflammation and improving V/Q mismatch. The seminal trial, ACURASYS, evaluated the use of NMBAs for early, moderate-severe ARDS. It reported an adjusted 90-day mortality benefit of 9.1% with a reduction in the incidence of VILI in patients with a PaO 2 /FiO 2 < 120. Despite these findings, enthusiasm for NMBA use in ARDS remained lackluster.

To dispel the concerns associated with adoption of NMBAs, the recently published ROSE trial evaluated the use of NMBAs for early, moderate-severe ARDS. It reported no difference in 90-day mortality or incidence of VILI. The conflicting results of the two major trials bring to question the role of NMBAs in the management of ARDS.

The divergent results could be accounted for by various factors (Table 1). First, ARDS was defined differently in both trials. Although patients were enrolled with PaO 2 /FiO 2 < 150 mmHg, ROSE patients had a higher baseline PEEP (≥ 8 cm H 2 O). Second, patients were enrolled 8 h earlier in ROSE [8(4–16) vs. 16(6–29) h]. Patients who would have been excluded from ACURASYS (those who rapidly improved before randomization) were likely included in ROSE limiting the trial's effect. Third, both non-pharmacologic and pharmacologic management was different. Patients in both arms of ACURASYS were deeply sedated, whereas only patients in the treatment arm of ROSE were deeply sedated. Deep sedation, especially in early ARDS, is associated with reverse triggering, which can result in breath stacking, VILI, and increased mortality. Reverse triggering and increased risk of ICU delirium, with decreased time to extubation secondary to deep sedation, may have resulted in higher mortality in the control arm in ACURASYS compared to those in the control arm of ROSE with lighter sedation targets. Finally, both studies protocolized ventilator management and lung protective strategies. However, patients in ROSE received lower FiO 2, but higher PEEP and lower tidal volumes in both study arms, probably improving lung recruitment and decreasing atelectrauma.

Study groups

In line with previous therapeutic protocols applied in patients with moderate-to-severe ARDS, we aimed to appraise a short course of NMBAs, applied early during the course of IMV. Thus, patients were assigned to the following study groups.

NMBA treatment

Use of NMBA treatment for at least 48 h and up to 3 consecutive days, initiated early, within 48 h from commencement of IMV.

Control

No use of NMBAs or administration only on the day IMV was commenced.

Of note, the time of first NMBAs administration was not recorded on the case report form; thus, the treatment group was designed to include up to 3 consecutive days of NMBAs exposure to ensure that at least 2 days of full treatment were achieved in most of the patients, even if treatment commenced during the night or a single NMBA dose was given upon endotracheal intubation. In addition, patients who were tracheally intubated and transferred from institutions not collaborating with the COVID-19-CCC/ECMOCARD were excluded from the analysis to avoid enrolment of subjects who might have received NMBA prior to study monitoring. Recording of NMBA use was censored at 28 days from ICU admission, or upon discharge from the ICU or death, whichever occurred first.

Outcomes

The primary objective was comparison between groups in 90-day in-hospital mortality, through PS matching analysis. Secondary objectives were the numbers of ventilator-free days (days since successful weaning from mechanical ventilation) between day 1 and day 28 and between day 1 and day 90 in the PS-matched population. VFD was calculated as follows: VFDs = 0 if subject died in hospital within 28 or 90 days of mechanical ventilation; VFDs = 28 or 90 − x if successfully liberated from ventilation x days after initiation; VFDs = 0 if the subject was mechanically ventilated for more than 28 or 90 days.

### Neuromuscular blockade in ARDS | NEJM resident 360… [^111rT7ze]. resident360.nejm.org (2019). Medium credibility.

Literature From Pages to Practice Published July 3, 2019 A few weeks ago, I cared for a patient with acute respiratory distress syndrome secondary to community acquired pneumonia. She arrived to the medical ICU on broad-spectrum antibiotics and was intubated for acute hypoxemic respiratory failure with a PaO. 2: FIO 2 ratio of 100. We placed her on low-tidal volume ventilation and despite increasing propofol infusion and fentanyl boluses, she kept "bucking the vent". The patient also had hypoxemia refractory to positive end-expiratory pressure and Fio 2 titration. The decision was made to add an infusion of cisatracurium, a neuromuscular blocking agent, to maximize her oxygenation by decreasing metabolic demand and patient-ventilator dyssynchrony, and in turn, reduce the risk of ventilator-associated lung injury.

Cisatracurium is one of the few pharmacologic agents that was thought to improve mortality in ARDS, based on the ACURASYS trial conducted about 10 years ago. The results indicated that early NMB use was associated with significantly improved 90-day survival, when compared with placebo, in patients with moderate-to-severe ARDS. However, early NBM blockade was never widely adopted because it requires deep sedation and the effect on neuromuscular function and other long-term outcomes is uncertain. In the Reevaluation of Systemic Early Neuromuscular Blockade trial, investigators reexamined the benefits of cisatracurium-induced paralysis in patients with moderate-to-severe ARDS. In this larger trial, patients were randomized to receive cisatracurium or no NMB.

Mortality at 90 days did not differ significantly between the two groups. Although these results may prove to be an epitaph for routine early NMB use in ARDS, editorialists argue that NMB agents can sometimes be used when physiologically indicated, as in the patient described above. The following NEJM Journal Watch summary explains the study and results in more detail: Patricia Kritek, MD reviewing The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute PETAL Clinical Trials Network. N Engl J Med 2019 May 19 Slutsky AS and Villar J. N Engl J Med 2019 May 19. Ten years ago, a large randomized trial demonstrated lower mortality when patients with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome were treated with neuromuscular blockade. Concerns about the deep sedation required for NMB, as well as the neuromuscular weakness associated with its use, led investigators to reexamine this benefit.

More than 1000 patients with moderate-to-severe ARDS were randomized to 48 hours of either cisatracurium with deep sedation or light sedation without NMB. More than half of patients had pneumonia; prone positioning was used rarely. The trial included a high positive end-expiratory pressure strategy. The trial was stopped early for futility. Mortality was quite high but was not different between groups. Lengths of stay and days free from mechanical ventilation were similar between groups; neuromuscular weakness and patient-reported quality of life at 3, 6, and 12 months also did not differ between groups. Comment: The high mortality seen in this study is perplexing. Some people have proposed that higher PEEP was not helpful but potentially harmful.

### Heterogenous treatment effect of neuromuscular blocking agents for moderate-to-severe ARDS: a post hoc Markov model re-analysis of the ACURASYS trial [^116GExzy]. Intensive Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

The beneficial effects of systematic cisatracurium administration observed in the ACURASYS randomized, multicenter, double-blinded trial may depend on patient-specific factors. This post hoc analysis aimed to explore whether the impact of cisatracurium on mortality varies with baseline characteristics.

Methods

A Markov chain analysis was conducted using daily clinical states from inclusion to day 90: death (state 0), under mechanical ventilation (state 1), or weaned and alive at day 90 (state 2). Patient trajectories were modeled accordingly.

Results

Among the 321 included patients, subgroup analysis following univariate analysis focused on 130 individuals under 60 years with non-fatal McCabe scores. Within this subgroup, cisatracurium administration and absence of vasopressor use significantly reduced the probability of remaining ventilated. Estimated survival increased therefore from 0.63 (placebo group, N = 62) to 0.93 (cisatracurium group, N = 68). In contrast, among patients with a rapidly or ultimately fatal prognosis according to McCabe score, the probability of survival did not differ substantially between the placebo and cisatracurium groups. Among patients with a PaO 2 :FiO 2 ratio ≤ 100 mmHg at inclusion (N = 65), the estimated survival rate at day 90 was 0.93 in the cisatracurium arm compared with 0.63 in the placebo arm. For patients with a PaO 2 :FiO 2 ratio > 100 mmHg at inclusion (N = 98), the corresponding survival rates were 0.92 and 0.63, respectively. In patients aged ≥ 60 years (N = 158), the daily probability of remaining mechanically ventilated was not influenced by any covariate, including the administration of cisatracurium. These results were confirmed by the performed simulations.

Conclusion

The systematic and short-term administration of cisatracurium in patients with moderate-to-severe ARDS appears to confer greater survival benefit in those with a higher baseline life expectancy. Further validation through retrospective and prospective studies is warranted.

### Neuromuscular blockade improves results in acute respiratory distress syndrome: a mechanism may Be prevention of expiratory muscle activity, which allows more lung expansion [^11266FEk]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Neuromuscular blockers are now used in ∼40% of patients with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Evidence for their use is not unambiguous, however. One large trial found that continuous neuromuscular block for the first 48 hours of the ICU stay improved 90-day mortality in patients with severe ARDS, whereas a more recent trial found no survival benefit. Possible mechanisms by which neuromuscular blockers improve outcome are preventing vigorous patient effort and thus limiting tidal lung distension, limiting patient–ventilator interactions and improving oxygenation, direct anti-inflammatory effects, or reducing total body oxygen consumption. Further elucidating these possible mechanisms would help determine which patients might benefit most from neuromuscular block.

### Early short course of neuromuscular blocking agents in patients with COVID-19 ARDS: a propensity score analysis [^113icuUf]. Critical Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Our results derived by PS-matching analysis suggest that among patients with COVID-19 and moderate-to-severe ARDS, early administration of a short course of NMBAs did not result in improved 90-day in-hospital mortality. In addition, NMBA treatment did not impact ventilator-free days. Thus, the use of NMBAs should be cautiously assessed in this population, pending further studies that could elucidate specific indications for NMBAs in COVID-19.

### An update on management of adult patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome: an official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^1116v4vi]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

This document updates previously published Clinical Practice Guidelines for the management of patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), incorporating new evidence addressing the use of corticosteroids, venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, neuromuscular blocking agents, and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP).

Methods

We summarized evidence addressing four "PICO questions" (patient, intervention, comparison, and outcome). A multidisciplinary panel with expertise in ARDS used the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation framework to develop clinical recommendations.

Results

We suggest the use of: 1) corticosteroids for patients with ARDS (conditional recommendation, moderate certainty of evidence), 2) venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in selected patients with severe ARDS (conditional recommendation, low certainty of evidence), 3) neuromuscular blockers in patients with early severe ARDS (conditional recommendation, low certainty of evidence), and 4) higher PEEP without lung recruitment maneuvers as opposed to lower PEEP in patients with moderate to severe ARDS (conditional recommendation, low to moderate certainty), and 5) we recommend against using prolonged lung recruitment maneuvers in patients with moderate to severe ARDS (strong recommendation, moderate certainty).

Conclusions

We provide updated evidence-based recommendations for the management of ARDS. Individual patient and illness characteristics should be factored into clinical decision making and implementation of these recommendations while additional evidence is generated from much-needed clinical trials.

Strengths and limitations

To date, this is the first international report of a large group of mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients with severe disease to investigate the effects of NMBA. Employing comprehensive PS matching analysis, we demonstrated no improvement in mortality with NMBA use. These findings were consistently corroborated in sensitivity analysis applying inverse probability of treatment weighting. In addition, we provided inferences not limited by clinical practice specific to single-country studies. Nonetheless, certain limitations must be highlighted. First, although we conducted a comprehensive comparative PS-matched analysis that resulted in significant homogeneity in the evaluated sub-cohorts, the observational nature of our study and risks of drawing causal inferences should be highlighted. While immortal time bias could be considered as a potential limitation of this study design, given the short duration between cohort entry and exposure to NMBA therapy, the magnitude of the bias is expected to be limited. In addition, similar times from ICU admission to death were found in both groups. Yet, the risk of immortal time bias should also be considered for several interventions potentially associated with survival — such as prone positioning, ECMO, and corticosteroids — since only patients who survived long enough to receive these interventions were analyzed. Second, the analyzed dataset did not provide any information on the type of NMBA, doses, or adequacy of the block achieved; hence, we were unable to extrapolate the appropriateness of their clinical use. In addition, the time of commencement of NMBA treatment was not recorded; thus, although we included patients who received NMBAs up to 3 days, and we explored different treatment regimens in sensitivity analyses, potential discrepancy in the clinically indicated 2-day full course of NMBA treatment should be considered when interpreting the results. Third, a proportion of the studied population was admitted to the ICU early during the pandemic. Consequently, potential logistical limitations related to managing critically ill patients treated in newly developed and understaffed ICUs, due to shortages in ICU beds or healthcare providers, must be considered. Fourth, as shown in Fig. 4, residual discrepancy for Asia likely persisted post-matching. Further assessment on the potential reasons for this divergence suggested possible increased mortality in control patients from Asia. This could be related to the specific regional differences in ventilatory practice or application of adjunctive therapies, which should be further explored in future studies. Irrespective, potential random effect related to heterogenous practice among collaborating hospitals should be considered while interpreting our results. Fifth, the voluntary nature of site participation in the study must be emphasized, especially during a pandemic, as data may be skewed toward centers with enough resources to enter data. Lastly, as our observational study acquired data from routine clinical records, missing data could have biased our estimates.

Uncertainties and research priorities

There are several unanswered questions about NMBAs in ARDS. Although their presumed mechanism of action is through the reduction of ventilator-induced lung injury by decreasing ventilator dyssynchrony, it remains unknown whether NMBAs might also be of benefit in sedated patients who are already fully passively ventilated. It is also unclear if there is a dose–response relationship across the spectrum of passive breathing to strong or dyssynchronous efforts. Some level of spontaneous breathing may be important to prevent diaphragmatic atrophy, whereas too much respiratory effort may cause lung and diaphragm injury; accordingly, NMBAs may have a variable impact on patients. Further research efforts should also focus on answering questions about NMBA agent selection, as well as the impact of the timing of initiation (i.e. early vs. late, immediately after meeting criteria vs. after a period of stabilization), dosing (i.e. partial blockade vs. full blockade, intermittent vs. continuous dosing), and duration. Finally, longitudinal data are needed to understand the impact of NMBAs on long-term outcomes.

Question 4: Should Patients with ARDS Receive Higher Compared with Lower PEEP, with or without LRMs?

Recommendation

We suggest using higher PEEP without LRMs rather than lower PEEP in patients with moderate to severe ARDS (conditional recommendation, low-moderate certainty). We recommend against using prolonged (PEEP ⩾35 cm H 2 O for > 60 s) LRMs in patients with moderate to severe ARDS (strong recommendation, moderate certainty).

Background

Higher PEEP can facilitate alveolar recruitment and prevent cyclic opening/closing injury, which may in turn improve gas exchange by decreasing intrapulmonary shunting and reduce lung stress. However, PEEP can also cause injurious overdistension in aerated lung and hemodynamic compromise via increased right ventricular afterload and decreased venous return. The net balance of benefit to harm is reliant on the proportion of recruitment to overdistension in an individual patient. The 2017 Clinical Practice Guideline previously issued conditional recommendations suggesting higher versus lower PEEP and the use of LRMs in patients with moderate to severe ARDS. Since that time, several large RCTs evaluating various PEEP strategies have been published. Some have included cointerventions of prolonged LRMs, defined as incremental increases in PEEP to achieve airway pressures ⩾35 cm H 2 O for ⩾60 seconds. Thus, it was important to incorporate these most recent studies into an updated recommendation.

### Early short course of neuromuscular blocking agents in patients with COVID-19 ARDS: a propensity score analysis [^1135JoyL]. Critical Care (2022). Medium credibility.

The severe respiratory failure associated with COVID-19 has been described as a form of ARDS, and the potential benefits of supportive treatments have largely been extrapolated from evidence in non-COVID-19-related ARDS. Thus, many COVID-19 patients have been treated with NMBAs, and in some areas even shortage of these medications has been reported, especially during the early phase of the pandemic. To the best of our knowledge, no international studies have clearly elucidated the effects of NMBAs on mortality in COVID-19 patients. Interestingly, in a multicenter observational study, Courcelle et al. reported that the duration of NMBA treatment in this population was often longer than 48 h and not associated with shorter duration of IMV.

To further delineate the role of NMBA in ventilated COVID-19 patients, data extracted from the multicenter registry of the international COVID-19 Critical Care Consortium incorporating the ExtraCorporeal Membrane Oxygenation for 2019 novel Coronavirus Acute Respiratory Disease (COVID-19–CCC/ECMOCARD) were examined. Our hypothesis was that in patients with microbiologically confirmed COVID-19 and moderate-to-severe ARDS, no significant difference in 90-day hospital mortality was to be found between populations who received or not early NMBAs. Thus, the primary goal of this study was to identify difference in 90-day mortality, through propensity score (PS)-adjusted analysis, between patients who received or not a short course of NMBAs, within 48 h from commencement of IMV.

Discussion

Our meta-analysis found that use of NMBAs in patients with ARDS might have benefits on short-term mortality, but had no significant effect on mid-term and long-term mortality. In addition, we found use of NMBAs could improve the PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio at 48 and 72 h, reduce the Pplat and PEEP at 72 h and was associated with less risk of barotrauma. Finally, our results showed use of NMBAs did not affect the days free of ventilation, the days not in ICU at day 28 and the risk of ICU- acquired weakness.

NMBAs may have beneficial effects on patients with ARDS through a variety of mechanisms. Such as decrease the oxygen consumption of respiratory and other muscles, reducing cardiac output, increasing the mixed venous partial pressure of oxygen, and increasing the partial pressure of arterial oxygen. By paralyzing respiratory muscles, neuromuscular blocking agents may indirectly minimize various manifestations of ventilator-induced lung injury. The most used NMBAs in patients with ARDS is cisatracurium. Comparison with cisatracurium, vecuronium has different pharmacological properties. Lyu evaluated the effects of vecuronium in patients with moderate or severe ARDS and they found vecuronium is associated with better prognosis. However, low methodological quality may bias their results, and they did not compare the different effects between cisatracurium and vecuronium. Sottile et al. compared the effects of cisatracurium with vecuronium in patients with or at risk for ARDS. They found there was no difference of mortality and hospital length of stay between two groups. Nevertheless, patients in the cisatracurium group experienced a shorter duration of mechanical ventilation and ICU length of stay. This may be because the metabolism and elimination of cisatracurium is independent of organ function and vecuronium is associated with a higher risk of ICU-acquired weakness. In a United States national survey, 94% of respondents used either bolus or infusion neuromuscular blockade in patients with ARDS and 62.1% of respondents used NMBAs as tier 1 rescue strategy. Due to limited evidence, recent guidelines only suggested use of NMBAs in patients with a PaO 2 /FiO 2 less than 150 with weak recommendation.

### Ventilator-associated pneumonia and ICU mortality in severe ARDS patients ventilated according to a lung-protective strategy [^116sXdAM]. Critical Care (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) may contribute to the mortality associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). We aimed to determine the incidence, outcome, and risk factors of bacterial VAP complicating severe ARDS in patients ventilated by using a strictly standardized lung-protective strategy.

Methods

This prospective epidemiologic study was done in all the 339 patients with severe ARDS included in a multicenter randomized, placebo-controlled double-blind trial of cisatracurium besylate in severe ARDS patients. Patients with suspected VAP underwent bronchoalveolar lavage to confirm the diagnosis.

Results

Ninety-eight (28.9%) patients had at least one episode of microbiologically documented bacterial VAP, including 41 (41.8%) who died in the ICU, compared with 74 (30.7%) of the 241 patients without VAP (P = 0.05). After adjustment, age and severity at baseline, but not VAP, were associated with ICU death. Cisatracurium besylate therapy within 2 days of ARDS onset decreased the risk of ICU death. Factors independently associated with an increased risk to develop a VAP were male sex and worse admission Glasgow Coma Scale score. Tracheostomy, enteral nutrition, and the use of a subglottic secretion-drainage device were protective.

Conclusions

In patients with severe ARDS receiving lung-protective ventilation, VAP was associated with an increased crude ICU mortality which did not remain significant after adjustment.

### An update on management of adult patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome: an official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^113uMcQN]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Our recommendations are largely consistent with recent guidelines published by the ESICM, although differences in methodology and the specific elements of clinical questions addressed account for some areas of divergence. With regard to PEEP, the ESICM guideline makes no recommendation for or against the routine use of higher versus lower PEEP strategies in ARDS, whereas we suggest the use of higher PEEP in select patients. However, it is important to note that our recommendation is narrower with regard to the patient population (moderate to severe ARDS only) and intervention (higher PEEP without accompanying recruitment maneuvers). Recommendations on NMBAs are also notably different: the ESICM guideline recommends against routine NMBA use in moderate to severe ARDS, whereas we suggest its use in early severe ARDS. This contrast reflects differences in studies and outcomes included in the evidence syntheses and, as with PEEP, our recommendations focus on a more limited patient population (severe ARDS only) and more specific intervention (early use of NMBAs).

### Myorelaxants in ARDS patients [^114583CB]. Intensive Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBAs) inhibit patient-initiated active breath and the risk of high tidal volumes and consequent high transpulmonary pressure swings, and minimize patient/ ventilator asynchrony in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Minimization of volutrauma and ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) results in a lower incidence of barotrauma, improved oxygenation and a decrease in circulating proinflammatory markers. Recent randomized clinical trials did not reveal harmful muscular effects during a short course of NMBAs. The use of NMBAs should be considered during the early phase of severe ARDS for patients to facilitate lung protective ventilation or prone positioning only after optimising mechanical ventilation and sedation. The use of NMBAs should be integrated in a global strategy including the reduction of tidal volume, the rational use of PEEP, prone positioning and the use of a ventilatory mode allowing spontaneous ventilation as soon as possible. Partial neuromuscular blockade should be evaluated in future trials.

### Biphasic positive airway pressure spontaneous breathing attenuates lung injury in an animal model of severe acute respiratory distress syndrome [^113RH7yk]. BMC Anesthesiology (2022). Medium credibility.

In ARDS, retention of SB is associated with better ventilation and less atelectasis in the gravity-dependent areas of the lungs and less overexpansion of the gravity-dependent areas of the lungs. In addition, the retention of SB can prevent periodic alveolar collapse, which may reduce atelectasis and may be associated with shorter intensive care unit stays. Jin et al found that in mild to moderate ARDS animal experiments, compared with controlled mechanical ventilation, SB reduced the pathological injury of lung tissue. However, some scholars believe that SB is unable to control tidal volume, which is prone to barotrauma; SB is not synchronized with ventilators to produce man-machine confrontation, which increases discomfort in the patient; SB can lead to lung hyperinflation, produce endogenous positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and increase the expression of inflammatory mediators, resulting in VILI. In addition, Yoshida et al. found that animal experimental studies have shown that SB may exacerbate a lung injury in severe ARDS patients, while neuromuscular blockers can alleviate a lung injury. NMBAs (neuromuscular blocking agents) have been used in ARDS treatment for decades, and are used to help increase alveolar recruitment and improve patient synchronization with the ventilator when administered in critically ill patients with ARDS within 48 hours after lung injury. In addition, NMBAs promote oxygenation and reduce mortality by preventing respiratory muscle contraction. In 2010, ACURASYS, a large multicentre trial, indicated that early use of neuromuscular blockers in patients with severe ARDS (oxygenation index, OI, PaO 2 /FiO 2 < 150) could shorten mechanical ventilation time, reduce organ failure and mortality. However, in moderate to severe ARDS patients treated with a high PEEP strategy, recent studies showed that there was no significant difference in 90-day mortality between patients who received an early and continuous cisatracurium infusion and those who received routine care and mild sedation. Whether NMBAs are routinely used for patients in the early stage of severe ARDS is controversial. Moreover, it has been proven that muscle relaxation is superior to SB in the early stage of severe ARDS. The ventilation mode used is volume-assisted-control ventilation (A/C-V) and pressure-assisted-control ventilation (A/C-P), which is an auxiliary autonomous breathing mode. This mode results in a higher probability of respiratory superposition, man-machine asynchrony and a greater possibility of mechanical VILI. Therefore, it is not appropriate to completely extrapolate the experimental results of the assisted SB mode to the unassisted SB mode. It is important to study the protective effect of unassisted autonomous breathing modes, such as BIPAP, on patients in the early stage of severe ARDS and its comparison with fully controlled ventilation in severe acute respiratory distress syndrome. In this study, we hypothesized that in the critical ARDS model induced by oleic acid inhalation, the use of the BIPAP unassisted SB mode could further improve oxygenation and alleviate VILI when compared with NMBAs.

### The prognostic value of early measures of the ventilatory ratio in the ARDS ROSE trial [^1143XQAY]. Critical Care (2022). Medium credibility.

The ventilatory ratio (VR), calculated as [minute ventilation (ml/min) × PaCO 2 (mm Hg)]/(predicted body weight (kg) × 100 × 37.5), is a surrogate for dead space that is easily obtained at the bedside with an arterial blood gas and assessment of the minute ventilation. VR measurements early after intubation have been shown to be associated with mortality in a large clinical trial and observational cohorts of ARDS, and in a more recent study, the trajectories of VR in intubated patients with COVID-19 were a strong predictor of mortality. VR is not an exact correlate of pulmonary dead space because it is also influenced by CO 2 production. Conditions and interventions that might modify the relationship between VR and clinical outcomes have not been previously studied. In theory, VR might perform differently among patients receiving neuromuscular blockade (NMB) compared to those not receiving NMB, as skeletal muscle metabolism may lead to increased CO 2 production in the latter group. To that end, the validity of VR as a prognostic marker in patients treated with NMB is untested, as prior studies evaluating VR did not adjust for its use. In addition, ARDS in its severest forms is commonly complicated by multiorgan failure, and preexisting organ failure substantially contributes to mortality. As such, it is not known to what extent the relationship between VR and adverse outcomes differs by baseline severity of illness.

The primary objective was to investigate whether neuromuscular blockade modified the relationship between VR and mortality in the Reevaluation of Systemic Early Neuromuscular Blockade (ROSE) trial. We tested for the first time whether elimination of skeletal muscle activity by neuromuscular blockade is a significant effect modifier in the relationship between VR and mortality in ventilated patients with moderate-to-severe ARDS by utilizing mixed effects modeling and multivariable logistic regression with interaction term analysis. In addition, because the ROSE cohort had high mortality and APACHE-III scores compared to other ARDS and PETAL cohorts, we analyzed the data from this cohort to test whether baseline severity of illness at enrollment is a separate effect modifier to the prognostic value of VR, as baseline organ dysfunction could result in other, extra-pulmonary causes of mortality.

### How low can oxygenation Go in ARDS? | NEJM resident 360… [^116UxsTL]. resident360.nejm.org (2025). Medium credibility.

Literature From Pages to Practice Published April 1, 2020 On March 11, 2020 the director-general of the World Health Organization declared Covid-19 — caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 — as a global pandemic. Early experience with Covid-19 has clearly demonstrated a wide spectrum of clinical presentations. As with Middle East respiratory syndrome and the original SARS before it, a proportion of patients develop hypoxemic respiratory failure due to acute respiratory distress syndrome. In the absence of a vaccine or definitive therapy, optimization of supportive care is critical in the management of these patients. Unified guidelines do not exist for oxygen saturation in mechanically ventilated patients, possibly reflecting the fact that optimal saturation is disease dependent. In studies of nonhypoxemic patients with acute myocardial infarction or stroke, higher oxygen targets were not beneficial.

Furthermore, an early clinical trial and subsequent systematic review demonstrated potential harm in over-oxygenation of acutely ill adults. Finally, the risks of supplemental oxygen in patients prone to hypercapnic respiratory failure are well known. In contrast with these studies, the LOCO 2 trial, published recently in NEJM, only enrolled patients with ARDS, a disease characterized by impaired gas exchange at the alveolar level. Patients were randomized to receive liberal oxygenation or conservative oxygenation with a primary outcome of all-cause death at 28 days. The trial was stopped early due to futility and safety concerns as 34. 3% of patents in the conservative group met the primary outcome compared to
26. 5% in the liberal group. LOCO. 2 contrasts the concurrently published ICU-ROX trial in its restriction to patients with ARDS where the pathophysiological process is impaired oxygenation.

In ICU-ROX, the use of conservative oxygen therapy, as compared with usual oxygen therapy, in adults undergoing mechanical ventilation in the ICU did not significantly affect the primary outcome of ventilator-free days or a secondary mortality outcome. These divergent results raise the possibility that ARDS patients may be more susceptible to hypoxemic insults as suggested by a higher number of mesenteric ischemic events in the conservative oxygenation group. The following NEJM Journal Watch summary explains the study and results in more detail: Patricia Kritek, MD reviewing Barrot L et al. N Engl J Med 2020 Mar 12 A recent study showed no benefit or harm from a conservative oxygen strategy that maintained oxygen saturation at < 97%. However, this target did not seem particularly conservative to many clinicians.

Investigators in France randomized patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome to either a target partial pressure of oxygen of 55 to 70 mm Hg or a PaO 2 of 90 to 105 mm Hg, for the first 7 days of treatment; three quarters of patients had moderately severe ARDS. The trial was stopped early due to safety concerns after 205 patients were enrolled. Although higher mortality in the conservative group did not reach statistical significance at 28 days, mortality at 3 months was significantly higher in the conservative group. Five mesenteric ischemic events occurred in the conservative group and none in the liberal group; most other measures did not differ. COMMENT: At the "conservative" titration goal, some patients likely had episodes of severe hypoxemia.

### Neuromuscular blocking agents in acute respiratory distress syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^1128kmsr]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

Materials and methods

By following a prespecified research protocol, this review included parallel-group randomized trials investigating the administration of any NMBA to mechanically ventilated adults with ARDS, as defined by American-European Consensus Conference (AECC), regardless of the underlying etiology, and dating back to 1966. Outcomes of interest included measures of mortality at 28 days, ICU discharge, and hospital discharge (primary outcome); duration of mechanical ventilation (in all patients and in survivors), ventilator-free days (VFDs), ICU and hospital stay; changes in oxygenation (measured by using the PO 2 /FiO 2 ratio); ICU-acquired weakness; and barotrauma (including pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, pneumatocele, and subcutaneous emphysema).

Search strategy

Computerized literature searches included MEDLINE (1966 to October 2012), EMBASE (1980 to October 2012), ACP Journal Club (1991 to October 2012), the Cochrane (Central) database, and clinical trial registries (clinicaltrials.gov, ISRCTN Register, and WHO ICTRP) (see Additional file 1). Relevant conference proceedings were searched electronically through a specific service provided through McMaster University.

Study selection and data extraction

Two reviewers (WA and MA) independently screened titles and abstracts in duplicate, without language restriction. The same duplicate, independent review process was followed by reviewing the full text of all potentially eligible articles; by reviewing citation lists of these articles for additional studies; and abstracting data (related to outcomes, or to risk of bias) onto customized, pretested forms. To resolve disagreements, we contacted study authors. For the purposes of this review, study authors provided unpublished data related to hospital mortality (truncated at 90 days), duration of mechanical ventilation, VFDs, and gas exchange.

Assessment of risk of bias of included studies

For each trial, reviewers used the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool to judge the adequacy of randomization, concealment, blinding, and outcome-data completeness, and to check for selective outcome assessments and other possible sources of bias. Reviewers judged the risk of bias in each of these domains as high risk, low risk, or unclear. The overall risk of bias for an individual trial was categorized as low when the risk of bias was low in all domains; unclear when the risk of bias was unclear in at least one domain, with no high-risk domains; or high when the risk of bias was high in at least one domain.

### Neuromuscular blocking agents in acute respiratory distress syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^113HBQVv]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

Results

After screening 740 titles and abstracts, we found three trials eligible for this review (Figure 1). All three trials originated from the same group of investigators, including a total of 431 patients, and one trial was conducted in 20 centers in France. The trials were specifically designed to investigate the effects of cisatracurium besylate, a benzylisoquinoline compound, on gas exchange, inflammatory markers, and clinically important outcomes, respectively. In each trial, cisatracurium besylate was infused for 48 hours, by using weight-based dosing in two trials, and a fixed high dose (15 mg bolus, followed by a continuous infusion of 37.5 mg per hour) in the other (Table 1). All three trials reported 28-day mortality, barotraumas, and ICU-acquired weakness; and these data were supplemented by additional, previously unpublished data from the study investigators.

In terms of the quality of individual trials, one trial had low risk of bias; the other two were judged to be at high risk of bias because of limitations in blinding (Table 2). In each trial, physicians and nurses ascertained that study patients were deeply sedated (with no response to glabellar tap) before initiating the study infusion. In two trials, the study drug-infusion bag (containing either cisatracurium besylate or normal saline) was concealed by a sheet, and the only caregivers explicitly aware of treatment allocation were bedside nurses caring for study participants during the 48 hours of study infusion. Nurses were responsible for the assessment of neuromuscular blockade (at 8-hour intervals during the study infusion and the following 24 hours) and for the protocolized delivery of sedation and cisatracurium besylate. The most recent trial included a more-robust placebo. Study infusion bags contained identical solutions of cisatracurium besylate or normal saline, prepared outside of the hospital; peripheral nerve stimulators were not used to assess depth of paralysis; nurses assessed plateau airway pressure to determine whether additional study drug was required.

### Risk factors for prolonged mechanical ventilation in critically ill patients with influenza-related acute respiratory distress syndrome [^117Ky3Us]. Respiratory Research (2024). Medium credibility.

In recent years, research has indicated that spontaneous ventilation can help to improve hypoxemia and lung compliance and reduce diaphragm atrophy in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

However, spontaneous breathing can lead to elevated respiratory drive and vigorous inspiratory efforts, causing uneven pressure distribution and potentially resulting in patient self-inflicted lung injury (P-SILI). Multiple animal studies have demonstrated detrimental cycles, such as asynchrony with the ventilator, elevated transpulmonary pressure, and double triggering, which further worsen lung injury. A trial in 2010 reported improved 90-day survival rates in severe ARDS patients receiving neuromuscular blockade (NMBAs), but a larger trial in 2019 contradicted these findings. Therefore, use of NMBAs in ARDS patients remains controversial. Although current evidence does not support routine early use of neuromuscular blockade in all adult patients with moderate to severe ARDS, utilizing NMBAs in the early stages of ARDS to ensure good synchrony with the ventilator and promote lung-protective strategies remains a reasonable treatment option. There are formal guidelines that recommend continuous infusion of NMBAs for less 48 h and evaluation daily by specialized physicians for ongoing use. Clinical data indicate that using neuromuscular blocking agents can reduce barotrauma and improve physiological and clinical outcomes. However, there are potential adverse effects on diaphragmatic contractile function and delayed extubation. Several studies and a meta-analysis on acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) have confirmed that neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBAs) do not improve mortality rates, ventilator-free days (VFDs), or the duration of mechanical ventilation. However, it is important to note that the incongruences in research methodologies lead to an inability to reach a definitive consensus on this matter.

### Assessment of therapeutic interventions and lung protective ventilation in patients with moderate to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^116ajfJk]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a lethal condition whereby the lung is injured by direct (eg, pneumonia or aspiration) or indirect (eg, extrapulmonary sepsis) insults. Clinically, patients with ARDS develop severe hypoxemia and/or hypercapnia, and most die of sepsis or multiorgan failure rather than from refractory respiratory failure. Acute respiratory distress is an important public health problem. A global epidemiologic studyreported that 10.4% of total intensive care unit admissions and 23.4% of all patients who were intubated had ARDS, with an associated hospital mortality of 40%.

Since the first description of ARDS in 1967, a number of approaches to its management have been evaluated and used clinically. Despite more than 50 years of research, to our knowledge, none of the treatments currently available are aimed directly at the pathophysiological mechanism resulting in acute respiratory failure (ie, increased alveolar capillary permeability); current approaches are mainly supportive. Perhaps most important has been the recognition that although mechanical ventilation is critical for the survival of patients with ARDS, it can also be injurious (ie, ventilator-induced lung injury). Indeed, lung protective ventilation (LPV), using low tidal volumes and airway pressures to mitigate ventilator-induced lung injury, is considered the mainstay of management in patients with ARDS.

In 2017, clinical practice guidelines on mechanical ventilation in adult patients with ARDS were published for 6 individual interventions, as follows: (1) LPV, (2) higher positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), (3) lung recruitment maneuvers (RMs), (4) high-frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV), (5) prone positioning, and (6) venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV ECMO). However, for clinicians, choosing between potentially efficacious treatments can be challenging if the treatments have not been directly compared in clinical trials (eg, prone positioning vs VV ECMO). Moreover, 4 randomized clinical trials (RCTs) — the Alveolar Recruitment for Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Trial (ART), the ECMO to Rescue Lung Injury in Severe ARDS (EOLIA) trial, the Esophageal Pressure-Guided Ventilation 2 (EPVent2) trial, and the Reevaluation of Systemic Early Neuromuscular Blockade (ROSE) trial — have been published since the guidelines were completed. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review and network meta-analysis to compare different therapeutic strategies simultaneously to identify the best strategy associated with a reduction in mortality and to rank those therapeutic modalities for adult patients with moderate to severe ARDS.

### Neuromuscular blocking agents in acute respiratory distress syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^113wDYNJ]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

After judging the risk of bias for each study, and pooling results across studies, we judged the quality of the totality of the evidence addressing the role for NMBAs in the management of ARDS. We used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach, which considers (a) risk of bias in individual trials, (b) consistency of results across trials), (c) potential for publication bias, (d) precision of pooled estimates, and (e) suitability of the individual study populations, interventions, and outcome assessments in directly addressing the question of this review.

### Association between train-of-four values and gas exchange indices in moderate to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome [^112Xi2N8]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is associated with a mortality rate of approximately 40%. Neuromuscular blockade is associated with an improvement in oxygenation and a reduction in mortality in ARDS.

Objective

The goal of this evaluation was to determine if the depth of paralysis, determined by train-of-four (TOF) monitoring, correlates with gas exchange in moderate to severe ARDS.

Methods

This was a retrospective review of moderate to severe ARDS patients who were prescribed > 12 hours of continuous infusion cisatracurium between January 1, 2013, and December 31, 2014, with a PaO 2 :FiO 2 ratio < 150 and documented TOF and arterial blood gases. Patients were evaluated for inclusion at 12, 24, and 48 hours after initiation of neuromuscular blockade.

Results

A total of 378 patients were screened for inclusion, with 107 evaluable patients meeting criteria at baseline. Poor correlation existed between TOF and oxygenation index (OI) at 12 (τ = 0.03), 24 (τ = 0.15) and 48 hours (τ = 0.08). When controlling for proning and baseline OI, the depth of paralysis did not have a significant effect on OI at 12, 24, or 48 hours.

Conclusions

This evaluation demonstrates that the use of TOF monitoring for neuromuscular blockade does not correlate with gas exchange markers in moderate to severe ARDS.

### Neuromuscular blocking agents in acute respiratory distress syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^115wevLg]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Randomized trials investigating neuromuscular blocking agents in adult acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) have been inconclusive about effects on mortality, which is very high in this population. Uncertainty also exists about the associated risk of ICU-acquired weakness.

Methods

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis. We searched the Cochrane (Central) database, MEDLINE, EMBASE, ACP Journal Club, and clinical trial registries for randomized trials investigating survival effects of neuromuscular blocking agents in adults with ARDS. Two independent reviewers abstracted data and assessed methodologic quality. Primary study investigators provided additional unpublished data.

Results

Three trials (431 patients; 20 centers; all from the same research group in France) met inclusion criteria for this review. All trials assessed 48-hour infusions of cisatracurium besylate. Short-term infusion of cisatracurium besylate was associated with lower hospital mortality (RR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.58 to 0.91; P = 0.005; I² = 0). This finding was robust on sensitivity analyses. Neuromuscular blockade was also associated with lower risk of barotrauma (RR, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.20 to 0.90; P = 0.02; I² = 0), but had no effect on the duration of mechanical ventilation among survivors (MD, 0.25 days; 95% CI, 5.48 to 5.99; P = 0.93; I² = 49%), or the risk of ICU-acquired weakness (RR, 1.08; 95% CI, 0.83 to 1.41; P = 0.57; I² = 0). Primary studies lacked protracted measurements of weakness.

Conclusions

Short-term infusion of cisatracurium besylate reduces hospital mortality and barotrauma and does not appear to increase ICU-acquired weakness for critically ill adults with ARDS.

### Clinical trials in acute respiratory distress syndrome: challenges and opportunities [^111QGTee]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

This year is the 50th anniversary of the first description of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Since then, much has been learned about the pathogenesis of lung injury in ARDS, with an emphasis on the mechanisms of injury to the lung endothelium and the alveolar epithelium. In terms of treatment, major progress has been made in reducing mortality from ARDS with lung-protective ventilation, using a tidal volume of 6 mL per kg of predicted bodyweight and a plateau airway pressure of less than 30 cm H 2 O. In more severely hypoxaemic patients with ARDS, neuromuscular blockade and prone positioning have further reduced mortality, probably by extending the therapeutic effects of lung protective ventilation. Fluid-conservative therapy has also increased ventilator-free days in patients with ARDS. The lack of success of pharmacological therapies for ARDS, however, presents a continued challenge in the field. In addition to presenting a brief summary of previous experience with clinical trials in ARDS, we focus in this Review on future opportunities to improve clinical trial design to maximise the likelihood of identifying beneficial pharmacological therapies. In view of the heterogeneity in ARDS, both prognostic and predictive enrichment strategies are needed that target therapies toward specific subgroups of patients with ARDS on the basis of both severity and biology. Approaches to reducing heterogeneity in ARDS clinical trials include using physiological, radiographic, and biological criteria to select patients for both phase 2 and 3 trials. Additionally, interest is growing in the design of preventive clinical trials in ARDS and to initiate early treatment of patients with acute lung injury before the need for endotracheal intubation. We also present promising new approaches to treating ARDS, including combination therapies, cell-based therapies, and generic pharmacological compounds with low-risk profiles that are already in routine clinical use for other clinical indications.

### Treatment mechanism and inflammatory subphenotyping in acute respiratory distress syndrome [^114WUb8V]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underpinning the pathogenesis of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) has advanced considerably during the past several decades. Yet, the translation of this knowledge into effective pharmacotherapies for ARDS has proven elusive. This gap is attributed in part to the heterogeneity inherent in its syndromic clinical definition. In recent years, multivariable classification and clustering analyses have consistently revealed hyperinflammatory and hypoinflammatory molecular subphenotypes of ARDS in multiple studies using different techniques. Post hoc analyses of randomized trials suggest that these subphenotypes respond differently to certain therapies. Thus, it is possible that therapies that failed to confer benefit in large efficacy trials might still be beneficial if administered to a carefully selected, favorably responsive ARDS subphenotype.

In this issue of the Journal, Sinha and colleagues (pp.) interrogated molecular subphenotypes of patients with ARDS enrolled in the ROSE (Reevaluation of Systemic Early Neuromuscular Blockade) trial. The ROSE trial compared cisatracurium neuromuscular blockade (NMB) for 48 hours versus usual care with lighter sedation and discouragement of paralytic agents. As in prior studies, Sinha and colleagues found that the trial population was best characterized by a two-class model distinguished largely by inflammatory cytokines, which they term the hyper- and hypoinflammatory subphenotypes, with mortality rates higher in the hyperinflammatory class. Relative to prior studies, a comparatively higher proportion of patients in the ROSE trial were classified as having the hyperinflammatory subphenotype (40%), potentially because the trial restricted enrollment to more severe ARDS (Pa O 2 /F O 2 ratio ≤ 150 mm Hg). We congratulate the authors for their important, innovative contributions to furthering the understanding of ARDS subphenotypes.

### When to intubate in acute hypoxaemic respiratory failure? Options and opportunities for evidence-informed decision making in the intensive care unit [^114M5y1T]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2024). High credibility.

The optimal timing of intubation in acute hypoxaemic respiratory failure is uncertain and became a point of controversy during the COVID-19 pandemic. Invasive mechanical ventilation is a potentially life-saving intervention but carries substantial risks, including injury to the lungs and diaphragm, pneumonia, intensive care unit-acquired muscle weakness, and haemodynamic impairment. In deciding when to intubate, clinicians must balance premature exposure to the risks of ventilation with the potential harms of unassisted breathing, including disease progression and worsening multiorgan failure. Currently, the optimal timing of intubation is unclear. In this Personal View, we examine a range of parameters that could serve as triggers to initiate invasive mechanical ventilation. The utility of a parameter (eg, the ratio of arterial oxygen tension to fraction of inspired oxygen) to predict the likelihood of a patient undergoing intubation does not necessarily mean that basing the timing of intubation on that parameter will improve therapeutic outcomes. We examine options for clinical investigation to make progress on establishing the optimal timing of intubation.

### Acetylcholine receptor antagonists in acute respiratory distress syndrome: much more than muscle relaxants [^115HmwHw]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Main text

Non-depolarizing neuromuscular blockers (NMBs), such as rocuronium and cisatracurium, are frequently used in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The Lung-Safe study reported that NMBs were used in 6.8% of mild ARDS and up to 37.8% of severe ARDS patients. Three clinical studies on the use of NMB in ARDS have been conducted by Papazian and colleagues. In their largest multicenter randomized controlled trial (ACURASYS study) it was demonstrated that continuous cisatracurium for 48 h reduced 90-day mortality (primary outcome) and improved oxygenation, in particular in patients with PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio ≤ 120 mmHg. Today, it is incompletely understood how NMBs improve outcome. Possible mechanisms include reduction of oxygen consumption, decrease in cardiac output and pulmonary blood flow, and direct anti-inflammatory effects of NMBs, but the most intuitive mechanism is by abolishing patient breathing effort and thereby limiting the risk of both alveolar collapse and over-distention. However, it is remarkable that no significant differences were found between groups in tidal volume, PEEP, plateau pressure, and minute ventilation. This suggests that other factors, not directly related to respiratory mechanics, may play a role in the beneficial effects of NMBs.

Acetylcholine receptors

NMBs exert their action through interaction with the acetylcholine receptor (AChR) in the neuromuscular junction. Two major types of AChRs have been characterized: the metabotropic muscarinic receptors (mAChRs) and the ionotropic nicotinic receptors (nAChRs); both are activated by ACh. The nAChR, a ligand-gated ion channel, is primarily found in the neuromuscular junction where binding with acetylcholine results in inflow of sodium and calcium and outflow of potassium, depolarizing the motor endplate and creating a potential that triggers muscle contraction. In addition, nAChRs are expressed by other tissues and cells, including brain, autonomic ganglia, macrophages, endothelial cells, and epithelial cells, explaining their involvement in physiological processes such as addiction, inflammation, and metabolic tonus. The mAChR is a G-protein-coupled receptor comprising five subtypes (M1–5) which are also widely expressed throughout the body. Table 1 shows an overview of the most important types of AChRs with their locations and main function.

### Effect of driving pressure on mortality in ARDS patients during lung protective mechanical ventilation in two randomized controlled trials [^113WHdmh]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Methods

This is a secondary analysis of patients enrolled in two previously published randomized controlled trials, namely Acurasys and Proseva. The first trial compared the neuromuscular blocking agent (NMBA) cisatracurium to placebo and the second compared the prone to the supine position. Both had similar inclusion criteria (notably early ARDS and partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood (PaO 2)/oxygen fraction in air (F I O 2) < 150 mm Hg under PEEP ≥ 5 cm H 2 O) and similar lung-protective mechanical ventilation (in particular 6 ml/kg predicted body weight V T, limited Pplat, rs and PEEP/F I O 2 table). ARDS was identified based on the American-European consensus definition criteria. Both trials identified significant survival benefit in the experimental group.

From the case report form of each original trial, we extracted the relevant variables for the present study, namely sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score, continuous NMBA infusion, prone position, pH, partial pressure of carbon dioxide in arterial blood (PaCO 2), PaO 2 /F I O 2, lactate, respiratory rate, V T, PEEP, Pplat, rs, Crs and ΔPrs, which were recorded at day 1 as the values corresponding to those gathered 24 hours after randomization in each trial. In addition, we used gender, age and simplified acute physiology score (SAPS) II recorded at the time of admission and compared between survivors and nonsurvivors at day 90. The allocation assignment in the two trials was entered as predefined covariates into the models. Furthermore, as recent experimental data suggest that the amount of energy transferred from the ventilator into the lung may be a contributing factor to ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI), we computed the mechanical power as ΔPrs × V T × respiratory rate. It was expressed as J/min and was included in the analysis in the present study.

### Extended neuromuscular blockade in acute respiratory distress syndrome does not increase mortality [^113tfjtV]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Neuromuscular blockade (NMB) is often utilized in the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Its use for a period of 48 h has been shown to improve mortality in randomized control trials. We aimed to characterize outcomes associated with a prolonged NMB. We hypothesized that the duration of NMB would not be associated with increased mortality.

Materials and Methods

This was a retrospective review from June 2014 to October 2016 of patients admitted to the surgical intensive care unit and receiving cisatracurium for ARDS. Patients paralyzed for ≤ 48 h (SHORT) were compared to those paralyzed for longer durations (LONG). Primary outcome was mortality. Parametric and nonparametric tests were utilized for the purposes of the comparison. A multivariate logistic regression model was utilized to adjust for differences.

Results

Of 73 patients meeting inclusion criteria, 32 (44%) were SHORT and 41 (56%) LONG. Compared to the LONG cohort, those in SHORT were older (60 versus 52 years, P = 0.04) but were comparable with respect to sex, acute physiology and chronic health evaluation IV scores, presence of concurrent pneumonia, and the use of vasopressors. SHORT patients were less likely to require rescue therapy with inhaled nitric oxide (28% versus 66%, P < 0.01). Overall mortality was 60%. There was no difference in the adjusted odds for mortality (adjusted odds ratio: 0.57, P = 0.33). Secondary outcomes including deep venous thrombosis and pneumonia did not differ between the two groups.

Conclusions

Extended NMB for ARDS was not associated with increased mortality. Discontinuation of this modality should not be based solely on the duration of therapy.

### Neuromuscular blocking agents for adult patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^116SEEfF]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Background

To explore the effect of neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBAs) on adult patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) by meta-analysis.

Methods

Three databases including Cochrane central register of controlled trials, PubMed, and Wanfang Data were searched to find relevant articles. We included randomized controlled trials that evaluated NMBAs compared with placebo or usual treatment in adult patients with ARDS.

Results

Five trials totaling 551 patients were identified eligible for inclusion. All the five trials were protective ventilation strategies based. All patients (the ratio of partial pressure of arterial oxygen/fraction of inspired oxygen ≤ 200 mm Hg) met American-European Consensus Conference or the Berlin definition oxygenation criteria for ARDS. Neuromuscular blocking agents significantly reduced intensive care unit mortality (relative risk, 0.73; 95% confidence intervals [CI], 0.58–0.93; p = 0.009; I = 0.0%; 4 trials, 455 patients) and 21- to 28-day mortality (relative risk, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.49–0.82; p = 0.001; I = 0.0%; 4 trials, 527 patients). At 48 hours, NMBAs improved oxygenation (weighted mean differences [WMD], 27.98; 95% CI, 7.45–48.51; p = 0.008; I = 44.2%; 4 trials, 212 patients). However, NMBAs have no effect on reduction of oxygenation at 24 hours (WMD, 26.83; 95% CI, -5.89 to 59.55; p = 0.108; I = 82.4%; 4 trials, 447 patients), and plateau pressure (WMD, 0.43; 95% CI, -0.46 to 1.31; p = 0.345; 4 trials, 455 patients) as well as positive end expiratory pressure (WMD, 0.10; 95% CI, -0.47 to 0.67; p = 0.73; 4 trials, 455 patients) at 48 hours.

Conclusion

Protective ventilation strategies based NMBAs treatment reduces mortality in patients with moderate to severe ARDS.

### Update in management of severe hypoxemic respiratory failure [^1134NxkF]. Chest (2017). Low credibility.

Mortality related to severe-moderate and severe ARDS remains high. We searched the literature to update this topic. We defined severe hypoxemic respiratory failure as Pao 2 /Fio 2 < 150 mm Hg (ie, severe-moderate and severe ARDS). For these patients, we support setting the ventilator to a tidal volume of 4 to 8 mL/kg predicted body weight (PBW), with plateau pressure (Pplat) ≤ 30 cm H 2 O, and initial positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 10 to 12 cm H 2 O. To promote alveolar recruitment, we propose increasing PEEP in increments of 2 to 3 cm provided that Pplat remains ≤ 30 cm H 2 O and driving pressure does not increase. A fluid-restricted strategy is recommended, and nonrespiratory causes of hypoxemia should be considered. For patients who remain hypoxemic after PEEP optimization, neuromuscular blockade and prone positioning should be considered. Profound refractory hypoxemia (Pao 2 /Fio 2 < 80 mm Hg) after PEEP titration is an indication to consider extracorporeal life support. This may necessitate early transfer to a center with expertise in these techniques. Inhaled vasodilators and nontraditional ventilator modes may improve oxygenation, but evidence for improved outcomes is weak.

### Patterns of use of adjunctive therapies in Patients with early moderate to severe ARDS: insights from the LUNG SAFE study [^1147YGHX]. Chest (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Adjunctive strategies are an important part of the management of ARDS. However, their application in clinical practice remains inconsistent.

Research Question

We wished to determine the frequency and patterns of use of adjunctive strategies in patients with moderate to severe ARDS (Pao 2 /Fio 2 [P/F ratio] < 150) enrolled into the Large observational study to UNderstand the Global impact of Severe Acute respiratory FailurE (LUNG SAFE) study.

Study Design and Methods

The LUNG SAFE study was an international, multicenter, prospective cohort study of patients with severe respiratory failure, conducted in 2014 in 459 ICUs from 50 countries. The primary objective of this substudy was to determine the frequency of use of widely available (neuromuscular blockade, prone position) adjuncts vs adjuncts requiring specialized equipment (extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, inhaled vasodilators, high-frequency ventilation) in patients in the first 48 h of moderate to severe ARDS (P/F ratio < 150).

Results

Of 1,146 patients on invasive ventilation with moderate to severe ARDS, 811 patients (71%) received no adjunct within 48 h of ARDS onset. Of 335 (29%) that received adjunctive strategies, 252 (75%) received a single strategy, and 83 (25%) receiving more than one adjunct. Of ARDS nonsurvivors, 67% did not receive any adjunctive strategy in the first 48 h. Most patients (67%) receiving specialized adjuncts did not receive prone positioning or neuromuscular blockade. Patients that received adjuncts were more likely to have their ARDS recognized, be younger and sicker, have pneumonia, be more difficult to ventilate, and be in a European high-income country than those that did not receive adjuncts.

Interpretation

Three in 10 patients with moderate to severe ARDS, and only one-third of nonsurvivors, received adjunctive strategies over the first 48 h of ARDS. A more consistent and evidence-driven approach to adjunct use may reduce costs and improve outcomes in patients with moderate to severe ARDS.

### An update on management of adult patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome: an official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^1133Sizs]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). High credibility.

American Thoracic Society acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) guideline — conclusions provide conditional recommendations supporting the use of corticosteroids in ARDS, VV-ECMO in selected patients with severe ARDS, neuromuscular blockers in early severe ARDS, and higher PEEP without LRMs in moderate to severe ARDS. With regard to differences from ESICM guidance, the document states "we suggest the use of higher PEEP in select patients" and clarifies that the recommendation is narrower "with regard to the patient population (moderate to severe ARDS only) and intervention (higher PEEP without accompanying recruitment maneuvers)"; for neuromuscular blocking agents, it notes "we suggest its use in early severe ARDS". For performance measurement, the committee determined that none of the new recommendations are suitable; measures retained from 2017 specify ventilation strategies limiting tidal volume to 4–8 mL/kg predicted body weight with inspiratory pressures (plateau pressure < 30 cm H2O) in ARDS, and prone positioning for > 12 hours per day in severe ARDS.

### Rhinovirus-associated severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) managed with airway pressure release ventilation (APRV) [^114z7bsD]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2019). Medium credibility.

This is what we did and why

Our patient transitioned from LPV protocol to APRV with subsequent synchrony with the ventilator. Mechanical ventilation settings were adjusted with P High corresponding to the plateau pressure and P Low selected at 0 cmH 2 O (figure 3). Titration of expiratory duration or release time was adjusted to correspond to mechanical changes of the patient's lung as previously described. Briefly, we adjusted the ventilator settings to T Low during the pressure release phase corresponding to approximately 50% of peak expiratory flow rate. She was weaned to extubation on POD9 from APRV using the 'drop and stretch method' along with continued diuresis. She was discharged home on POD13.

Figure 3
Ventilator wave form on postoperative day 6 (POD6). Representative image from airway pressure release ventilation (APRV) ventilator settings.

ARDS is non-cardiac respiratory failure characterized by hypoxemia and radiographic bilateral pulmonary opacities. The etiology can be multifactorial and includes intrinsic lung injury, trauma, and infection. We chose to present this case to highlight an underused mode of mechanical ventilation in the management of ARDS.

Our patient was initially supported with LPV. This ventilation mode is considered the gold standard and may reduce mortality. Persistent ventilator desynchrony and hypoxemia despite high-PEEP settings in our patient prompted utilization of short-term neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBA) with cisatracurium. Paralysis has been shown to improve oxygenation in two small randomized controlled trials. The ACURASYS trial showed early paralysis with 48 hours of NMBA was associated with more ventilator-free days and improved mortality at 90 days. Unfortunately, our patient proved refractory to NMBA and LPV. The PROSEVA trial has shown reduced mortality and survival benefit using prone positioning in the management of moderate to severe ARDS. However, we elected not to prone due to limitations associated with our patient's body habitus and BMI.

### Early short course of neuromuscular blocking agents in patients with COVID-19 ARDS: a propensity score analysis [^1174vUm2]. Critical Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

The role of neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBAs) in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is not fully elucidated. Therefore, we aimed to investigate in COVID-19 patients with moderate-to-severe ARDS the impact of early use of NMBAs on 90-day mortality, through propensity score (PS) matching analysis.

Methods

We analyzed a convenience sample of patients with COVID-19 and moderate-to-severe ARDS, admitted to 244 intensive care units within the COVID-19 Critical Care Consortium, from February 1, 2020, through October 31, 2021. Patients undergoing at least 2 days and up to 3 consecutive days of NMBAs (NMBA treatment), within 48 h from commencement of IMV were compared with subjects who did not receive NMBAs or only upon commencement of IMV (control). The primary objective in the PS-matched cohort was comparison between groups in 90-day in-hospital mortality, assessed through Cox proportional hazard modeling. Secondary objectives were comparisons in the numbers of ventilator-free days (VFD) between day 1 and day 28 and between day 1 and 90 through competing risk regression.

Results

Data from 1953 patients were included. After propensity score matching, 210 cases from each group were well matched. In the PS-matched cohort, mean (± SD) age was 60.3 ± 13.2 years and 296 (70.5%) were male and the most common comorbidities were hypertension (56.9%), obesity (41.1%), and diabetes (30.0%). The unadjusted hazard ratio (HR) for death at 90 days in the NMBA treatment vs control group was 1.12 (95% CI 0.79, 1.59, p = 0.534). After adjustment for smoking habit and critical therapeutic covariates, the HR was 1.07 (95% CI 0.72, 1.61, p = 0.729). At 28 days, VFD were 16 (IQR 0–25) and 25 (IQR 7–26) in the NMBA treatment and control groups, respectively (sub-hazard ratio 0.82, 95% CI 0.67, 1.00, p = 0.055). At 90 days, VFD were 77 (IQR 0–87) and 87 (IQR 0–88) (sub-hazard ratio 0.86 (95% CI 0.69, 1.07; p = 0.177).

Conclusions

In patients with COVID-19 and moderate-to-severe ARDS, short course of NMBA treatment, applied early, did not significantly improve 90-day mortality and VFD. In the absence of definitive data from clinical trials, NMBAs should be indicated cautiously in this setting.

### Effects of interventions on survival in acute respiratory distress syndrome: an umbrella review of 159 published randomized trials and 29 meta-analyses [^114X8kMs]. Intensive Care Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose

Multiple interventions have been tested in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). We examined the entire agenda of published randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in ARDS that reported on mortality and of respective meta-analyses.

Methods

We searched PubMed, the Cochrane Library, and Web of Knowledge until July 2013. We included RCTs in ARDS published in English. We excluded trials of newborns and children; and those on short-term interventions, ARDS prevention, or post-traumatic lung injury. We also reviewed all meta-analyses of RCTs in this field that addressed mortality. Treatment modalities were grouped in five categories: mechanical ventilation strategies and respiratory care, enteral or parenteral therapies, inhaled/intratracheal medications, nutritional support, and hemodynamic monitoring.

Results

We identified 159 published RCTs of which 93 had overall mortality reported (n = 20,671 patients) — 44 trials (14,426 patients) reported mortality as a primary outcome. A statistically significant survival benefit was observed in eight trials (seven interventions) and two trials reported an adverse effect on survival. Among RCTs with more than 50 deaths in at least one treatment arm (n = 21), two showed a statistically significant mortality benefit of the intervention (lower tidal volumes and prone positioning), one showed a statistically significant mortality benefit only in adjusted analyses (cisatracurium), and one (high-frequency oscillatory ventilation) showed a significant detrimental effect. Across 29 meta-analyses, the most consistent evidence was seen for low tidal volumes and prone positioning in severe ARDS.

Conclusions

There is limited supportive evidence that specific interventions can decrease mortality in ARDS. While low tidal volumes and prone positioning in severe ARDS seem effective, most sporadic findings of interventions suggesting reduced mortality are not corroborated consistently in large-scale evidence including meta-analyses.

### Molecular phenotypes of acute respiratory distress syndrome in the ROSE trial have differential outcomes and gene expression patterns that differ at baseline and longitudinally over time [^113tWMQJ]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Rationale: Two molecular phenotypes have been identified in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). In the ROSE (Reevaluation of Systemic Early Neuromuscular Blockade) trial of cisatracurium in moderate to severe ARDS, we addressed three unanswered questions: 1) Do the same phenotypes emerge in a more severe ARDS cohort with earlier recruitment; 2) Do phenotypes respond differently to neuromuscular blockade? and 3) What biological pathways most differentiate inflammatory phenotypes? Methods: We performed latent class analysis in ROSE using preenrollment clinical and protein biomarkers. In a subset of patients (n = 134), we sequenced whole-blood RNA using enrollment and Day 2 samples and performed differential gene expression and pathway analyses. Informed by the differential gene expression analysis, we measured additional plasma proteins and evaluated their abundance relative to gene expression amounts. Measurements and Main Results: In ROSE, we identified the hypoinflammatory (60.4%) and hyperinflammatory (39.6%) phenotypes with similar biological and clinical characteristics as prior studies, including higher mortality at Day 90 for the hyperinflammatory phenotype (30.3% vs. 61.6%; P < 0.0001). We observed no treatment interaction between the phenotypes and randomized groups for mortality. The hyperinflammatory phenotype was enriched for genes associated with innate immune response, tissue remodeling, and zinc metabolism at Day 0 and collagen synthesis and neutrophil degranulation at Day 2. Longitudinal changes in gene expression patterns differed dependent on survivorship. For most highly expressed genes, we observed correlations with their corresponding plasma proteins' abundance. However, for the class-defining plasma proteins in the latent class analysis, no correlation was observed with their corresponding genes' expression. Conclusions: The hyperinflammatory and hypoinflammatory phenotypes have different clinical, protein, and dynamic transcriptional characteristics. These findings support the clinical and biological potential of molecular phenotypes to advance precision care in ARDS.

Surviving Sepsis Campaign 2021 — neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBAs) in sepsis-induced moderate-severe ARDS: For adults with sepsis induced moderate-severe ARDS, we suggest using intermittent NMBA boluses, over NMBA continuous infusion; prior and recent evidence includes that continuous NMBA infusion did not improve mortality versus a light sedation strategy with as needed NMBA boluses and no continuous infusion (RR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.86–1.15), reduced mortality compared to deep sedation with as needed NMBA boluses (RR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.57–0.89), and reduced barotrauma (RR, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.35–0.85), while earlier meta-analysis showed reduced risk of death (RR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.58–0.91) and barotrauma (RR, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.20–0.90) with cisatracurium infusion; given uncertainty, the panel issued a weak recommendation favoring intermittent NMBA boluses over a continuous infusion, and if NMBAs are used, clinicians must ensure adequate patient sedation and analgesia.

### An update on management of adult patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome: an official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^113Ysm1S]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). High credibility.

American Thoracic Society ARDS guideline — new recommendations emphasize adjunctive therapies and ventilatory strategies: We suggest using corticosteroids for patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS); we suggest using venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV-ECMO) in selected patients with severe ARDS; and we suggest using neuromuscular blockers in patients with early severe ARDS. With regard to positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), we suggest using higher PEEP without lung recruitment maneuvers (LRMs) as opposed to lower PEEP in patients with moderate to severe ARDS, and we recommend against using prolonged LRMs in patients with moderate to severe ARDS.

### Variation in early management practices in Moderate-to-severe ARDS in the United States: the severe ARDS: generating evidence study [^111gcQ6a]. Chest (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Although specific interventions previously demonstrated benefit in patients with ARDS, use of these interventions is inconsistent, and patient mortality remains high. The impact of variability in center management practices on ARDS mortality rates remains unknown.

Research Question

What is the impact of treatment variability on mortality in patients with moderate to severe ARDS in the United States?

Study Design and Methods

We conducted a multicenter, observational cohort study of mechanically ventilated adults with ARDS and Pao 2 to Fio 2 ratio of ≤ 150 with positive end-expiratory pressure of ≥ 5 cm H 2 O, who were admitted to 29 US centers between October 1, 2016, and April 30, 2017. The primary outcome was 28-day in-hospital mortality. Center variation in ventilator management, adjunctive therapy use, and mortality also were assessed.

Results

A total of 2,466 patients were enrolled. Median baseline Pao 2 to Fio 2 ratio was 105 (interquartile range, 78.0–129.0). In-hospital 28-day mortality was 40.7%. Initial adherence to lung protective ventilation (LPV; tidal volume, ≤ 6.5 mL/kg predicted body weight; plateau pressure, or when unavailable, peak inspiratory pressure, ≤ 30 mm H 2 O) was 31.4% and varied between centers (0%-65%), as did rates of adjunctive therapy use (27.1%-96.4%), methods used (neuromuscular blockade, prone positioning, systemic steroids, pulmonary vasodilators, and extracorporeal support), and mortality (16.7%-73.3%). Center standardized mortality ratios (SMRs), calculated using baseline patient-level characteristics to derive expected mortality rate, ranged from 0.33 to 1.98. Of the treatment-level factors explored, only center adherence to early LPV was correlated with SMR.

Interpretation

Substantial center-to-center variability exists in ARDS management, suggesting that further opportunities for improving ARDS outcomes exist. Early adherence to LPV was associated with lower center mortality and may be a surrogate for overall quality of care processes. Future collaboration is needed to identify additional treatment-level factors influencing center-level outcomes.
