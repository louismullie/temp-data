## Question

What are the acg guidelines for colon cancer screening

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the ACG 2021 colorectal cancer screening guidelines, including age ranges, modalities, intervals, family history, hereditary syndromes, quality metrics, and how these compare with other societies. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the guideline scope and grading methodology. Then, I should verify age-based recommendations for average-risk adults. Next, I will examine the primary screening modalities and intervals, followed by alternative options. After that, I need to check family history–based risk stratification and hereditary syndromes. I will then review quality indicators for colonoscopy. Finally, I should consider implementation, disparities, and how ACG aligns with USPSTF, ACS, and AGA positions, before summarizing practical takeaways.

> Let me first confirm the guideline framework and evidence base. The ACG 2021 guideline uses a modified GRADE approach with "recommend" for strong recommendations and "suggest" for conditional recommendations, and it addresses average-risk adults aged 40 years and older, with a comprehensive literature search through October 2020, which establishes the foundation for the recommendations I'm about to detail [^57f00c59] [^ea429d40].

> I need to verify the age-based recommendations for average-risk individuals. For adults aged 50 to 75 years, ACG gives a strong recommendation to screen to reduce incidence of advanced adenoma, CRC, and CRC mortality, which reflects moderate-quality evidence and aligns with broad consensus across societies [^f4ecab56] [^46dd8772]. For adults aged 45 to 49 years, ACG issues a conditional recommendation to screen, reflecting very low–quality evidence but responding to rising incidence in younger adults and modeling suggesting potential benefit; this is consistent with USPSTF's Grade B recommendation to start at 45 and ACS's qualified recommendation to begin at 45, while AGA also supports starting at 45 in average-risk adults [^f4ecab56] [^bfe63712] [^98ce2e18] [^e88140eb]. For adults older than 75 years, ACG advises individualizing the decision to continue screening based on comorbidity, prior screening history, and life expectancy, noting that benefits of polypectomy accrue after 7–10 years and that risks may outweigh benefits in the oldest patients, which is echoed by ACS and AGA guidance to individualize in this age band [^f4ecab56] [^74734c05] [^dd15438a] [^323bfa66] [^b7b4af6b].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about modalities; I should confirm the primary tests and intervals. ACG recommends colonoscopy every 10 years and annual FIT as the two primary screening modalities, with colonoscopy providing both detection and prevention in a single step and FIT serving as a highly sensitive, cost-effective noninvasive option that reduces CRC mortality by about 12% over 15 years with biennial testing, though annual FIT is preferred for programmatic performance [^f4ecab56] [^46dd8772] [^24322cd5] [^2f17d28d]. Wait, let me verify the mortality data; yes, systematic reviews support a 12% relative mortality reduction with biennial fecal-based testing, reinforcing the value of annual FIT in practice [^24322cd5].

> Next, I should review alternative options for those unable or unwilling to undergo colonoscopy or FIT. ACG suggests flexible sigmoidoscopy every 5–10 years, multitarget stool DNA testing every 3 years, CT colonography every 5 years, and colon capsule every 5 years, while recommending against Septin 9 for screening; these alternatives are generally reserved when first-line options are declined or contraindicated, and positive results require diagnostic colonoscopy follow-up [^f4ecab56] [^2bb500b2] [^e9b83079]. I should double-check performance characteristics: FIT has about 79% sensitivity and 94% specificity for CRC, multitarget stool DNA has about 92% sensitivity and 87% specificity, and colon capsule shows roughly 81% sensitivity and 93% specificity for polyps ≥ 6 mm, which helps explain why these are acceptable alternatives when colonoscopy or FIT are not feasible [^0fe8aeb4] [^fd7a9f0f].

> I will now examine family history–based risk stratification, since this often changes the starting age and modality. For individuals with one first-degree relative diagnosed before age 60 or with two or more first-degree relatives at any age, ACG suggests colonoscopy every 5 years starting at age 40 or 10 years before the youngest affected relative, whichever is earlier; for those with a single first-degree relative diagnosed at age 60 or older, ACG suggests starting at 40 and then resuming average-risk screening thereafter, and for one second-degree relative, average-risk screening is appropriate; ACG also suggests considering genetic evaluation when the familial burden is high [^e1e6c277] [^37ee6f8b] [^44dc8ed8] [^c8e873bb] [^d8308908] [^8e87eedd]. Let me reconsider whether FIT is acceptable in high-risk family history; ACG emphasizes colonoscopy for increased risk, and while USPSTF notes annual FIT can be considered if colonoscopy is declined, ACG prioritizes colonoscopy in this group, which I should emphasize to avoid overpromising FIT in high-risk settings [^f4ecab56].

> But wait, what if the patient has a hereditary syndrome; I need to ensure I get the surveillance cadence right. For Lynch syndrome, ACG recommends colonoscopy at least every 2 years starting at age 20–25, with annual colonoscopy considered in confirmed mutation carriers, given the accelerated adenoma–carcinoma sequence and high lifetime CRC risk; for classic adenomatous polyposis syndromes, annual colonoscopy or flexible sigmoidoscopy starting at puberty is advised; for serrated polyposis, colonoscopy every 1–3 years is recommended; and for hereditary diffuse gastric cancer with a family history of colon cancer, colonoscopy starting at age 40 is suggested [^6d1fc039] [^d899f0a2] [^c99f427b] [^03f2fdec] [^14bfd8be]. Hold on, I should verify that these are strong recommendations; yes, many are strong recommendations with moderate- to low-quality evidence, reflecting the urgency of early, intensive surveillance in these syndromes [^6d1fc039] [^d899f0a2].

> Next, I should review colonoscopy quality metrics, because test performance depends on operator quality. ACG recommends that endoscopists measure and achieve a cecal intubation rate of at least 95%, an adenoma detection rate of at least 25% overall with sex-specific targets of 30% in men and 20% in women, and a minimum withdrawal time of 6 minutes; colonoscopists with ADR below 25% should undertake remedial training, given the strong association between higher ADR and lower postcolonoscopy CRC risk [^dd22ffee] [^7d0d9574] [^e56f909c]. I should confirm that these thresholds are supported; yes, observational data show each 1% increase in ADR associates with lower CRC incidence and mortality, and programs with higher ADRs have fewer interval cancers, which justifies these benchmarks [^e56f909c].

> I need to ensure implementation and equity considerations are addressed. ACG supports organized screening programs to improve adherence, recommends patient navigation, reminders, and clinician prompts to increase uptake, and highlights that nearly one-third of eligible U.S. adults remain unscreened; ACG also calls attention to disparities in African Americans, who have higher stage-adjusted mortality and lower screening rates, supporting targeted outreach and consideration of starting at age 45 in this population, which aligns with modeling and epidemiologic data [^092d00d5] [^dc533c6d] [^5265840c] [^d8143a1f]. Hold on, I should verify that the modeling supports earlier initiation; yes, CISNET modeling suggests starting at 45 yields additional life-years, though screening the 45–49 cohort requires resources and may compete with reaching the 80% uptake target in older adults, underscoring the need for programmatic efficiency [^d8143a1f].

> Let me consider how ACG compares with other major societies to avoid overstatement. USPSTF gives a Grade A for ages 50–75, a Grade B for 45–49, and a Grade C for 76–85 individualized screening, which matches ACG's age framework and strength gradations, while ACS recommends starting at 45 for all adults and individualizing 76–85, and AGA supports starting at 45 and emphasizes colonoscopy for increased-risk patients; these convergences reinforce ACG's core positions while reflecting minor differences in emphasis and evidence grading [^bfe63712] [^98ce2e18] [^e88140eb] [^353a799f]. I should double-check that ACG's tiered test approach is consistent with multisociety guidance; yes, USMSTF similarly places colonoscopy and FIT as tier 1 options, with CTC, FIT-fecal DNA, and sigmoidoscopy as tier 2, aligning with ACG's primary and alternative categorization [^3fa4e8a8].

> Finally, I should synthesize practical takeaways. For average-risk adults, prioritize colonoscopy every 10 years or annual FIT, start at 50 with strong support, consider starting at 45 with conditional support, and individualize beyond 75; for increased risk due to family history, use colonoscopy and start earlier based on the number and age of affected relatives; for hereditary syndromes, intensify surveillance frequency and start much earlier; and ensure high-quality colonoscopy with measured ADR, CIR, and withdrawal time, while leveraging organized programs to close the screening gap and address disparities [^f4ecab56] [^46dd8772] [^e1e6c277] [^6d1fc039] [^dd22ffee] [^092d00d5]. Hold on, I should verify that I've captured the key intervals correctly: FIT annually, colonoscopy every 10 years, sigmoidoscopy every 5–10 years, multitarget stool DNA every 3 years, CTC and colon capsule every 5 years, and avoid Septin 9; yes, that aligns with ACG's interval recommendations and performance summaries [^e9b83079] [^0fe8aeb4].

---

The ACG recommends **colonoscopy every 10 years** or **annual FIT** as primary screening for average-risk adults aged 50–75 years [^f4ecab56], with a conditional suggestion to screen adults 45–49 years [^46dd8772] [^2b2b4463]. For those unable or unwilling to undergo colonoscopy or FIT, **flexible sigmoidoscopy every 5–10 years**, **multitarget stool DNA every 3 years**, **CT colonography every 5 years**, or **colon capsule every 5 years** are acceptable alternatives [^2bb500b2] [^890238bc]. Screening beyond age 75 should be individualized based on health, prior screening, and life expectancy [^f4ecab56] [^74734c05]. For high-risk individuals, start earlier and use colonoscopy at shorter intervals [^e1e6c277] [^c8e873bb]; for example, those with a first-degree relative with CRC or advanced adenoma should start at 40 or 10 years before the youngest affected relative, with colonoscopy every 5 years [^e1e6c277] [^c8e873bb]. The ACG advises against **Septin 9** for screening [^f4ecab56] and emphasizes quality metrics for colonoscopy, including ADR ≥ 25% and withdrawal time ≥ 6 minutes [^dd22ffee] [^7d0d9574].

## Age range and risk stratification

- **Average-risk individuals**: Ages 50–75 years; strong recommendation to screen [^f4ecab56] [^46dd8772].
- **Ages 45–49 years**: Conditional recommendation to screen due to rising incidence [^f4ecab56] [^d8143a1f].
- **Ages 76–85 years**: Individualize based on health, prior screening, and life expectancy [^f4ecab56] [^74734c05] [^dd15438a].
- **High-risk individuals**: Start earlier and use colonoscopy at shorter intervals (see below) [^e1e6c277] [^c8e873bb].

---

## Primary screening modalities and intervals

| **Modality** | **Interval** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|-|
| Colonoscopy | Every 10 years | Strong recommendation |
| FIT | Annually | Strong recommendation |
| Flexible sigmoidoscopy | Every 5–10 years | Conditional recommendation |
| Multitarget stool DNA (Cologuard) | Every 3 years | Conditional recommendation |
| CT colonography | Every 5 years | Conditional recommendation |
| Colon capsule | Every 5 years | Conditional recommendation |

---

Colonoscopy and FIT are the **primary recommended modalities** [^f4ecab56]; alternatives are for those unable or unwilling to undergo them [^2bb500b2] [^890238bc].

---

## High-risk individuals and special populations

- **First-degree relative with CRC or advanced adenoma**: Start at 40 or 10 years before the youngest affected relative; colonoscopy every 5 years [^e1e6c277] [^c8e873bb].
- **Hereditary syndromes (e.g. Lynch, FAP)**: Start earlier with more frequent colonoscopy (every 1–2 years) [^6d1fc039] [^d899f0a2].
- **Inflammatory bowel disease**: Colonoscopy every 1–3 years based on disease duration and activity [^notfound].

---

## Quality indicators for colonoscopy

Colonoscopists should meet **quality thresholds** to minimize missed lesions and post-colonoscopy CRC [^e56f909c]:

- **Adenoma detection rate (ADR)**: ≥ 25% overall; ≥ 30% in men; ≥ 20% in women [^dd22ffee] [^7d0d9574].
- **Withdrawal time**: ≥ 6 minutes [^dd22ffee] [^7d0d9574].
- **Cecal intubation rate**: ≥ 95% [^dd22ffee] [^7d0d9574].

---

## Tests not recommended

The ACG recommends against **Septin 9** for CRC screening due to poor sensitivity and limited evidence [^f4ecab56].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Primary screening**: Colonoscopy every 10 years or annual FIT for ages 50–75 [^f4ecab56] [^46dd8772].
- **Ages 45–49**: Consider screening conditionally [^f4ecab56] [^2b2b4463].
- **Ages 76–85**: Individualize based on health and prior screening [^f4ecab56] [^74734c05].
- **High-risk**: Start earlier, use colonoscopy, and shorten intervals [^e1e6c277] [^c8e873bb].
- **Quality**: Ensure ADR ≥ 25%, withdrawal time ≥ 6 minutes, and cecal intubation ≥ 95% [^dd22ffee] [^7d0d9574].

---

The ACG emphasizes **shared decision-making** and tailoring screening to patient preferences, risk, and access to ensure effective, equitable CRC prevention [^dc533c6d] [^092d00d5].

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer in men and women in the United States. CRC screening efforts are directed toward removal of adenomas and sessile serrated lesions and detection of early-stage CRC. The purpose of this article is to update the 2009 American College of Gastroenterology CRC screening guidelines. The guideline is framed around several key questions. We conducted a comprehensive literature search to include studies through October 2020. The inclusion criteria were studies of any design with men and women age 40 years and older. Detailed recommendations for CRC screening in average-risk individuals and those with a family history of CRC are discussed. We also provide recommendations on the role of aspirin for chemoprevention, quality indicators for colonoscopy, approaches to organized CRC screening and improving adherence to CRC screening. CRC screening must be optimized to allow effective and sustained reduction of CRC incidence and mortality. This can be accomplished by achieving high rates of adherence, quality monitoring and improvement, following evidence-based guidelines, and removing barriers through the spectrum of care from noninvasive screening tests to screening and diagnostic colonoscopy. The development of cost-effective, highly accurate, noninvasive modalities associated with improved overall adherence to the screening process is also a desirable goal.

### American College of Gastroenterology guidelines for colorectal cancer screening 2009 [^4f86e6ae]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2009). Low credibility.

This document is the first update of the American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) colorectal cancer (CRC) screening recommendations since 2000. The CRC screening tests are now grouped into cancer prevention tests and cancer detection tests. Colonoscopy every 10 years, beginning at age 50, remains the preferred CRC screening strategy. It is recognized that colonoscopy is not available in every clinical setting because of economic limitations. It is also realized that not all eligible persons are willing to undergo colonoscopy for screening purposes. In these cases, patients should be offered an alternative CRC prevention test (flexible sigmoidoscopy every 5–10 years, or a computed tomography (CT) colonography every 5 years) or a cancer detection test (fecal immunochemical test for blood, FIT).

### Screening for colorectal cancer: a guidance statement from the American College of Physicians [^de108fcf]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Description

Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths for men and women in the United States. The American College of Physicians (ACP) developed this guidance statement for clinicians by assessing the current guidelines developed by other organizations on screening for colorectal cancer. When multiple guidelines are available on a topic or when existing guidelines conflict, ACP believes that it is more valuable to provide clinicians with a rigorous review of the available guidelines rather than develop a new guideline on the same topic.

Methods

The authors searched the National Guideline Clearinghouse to identify guidelines developed in the United States. Four guidelines met the inclusion criteria: a joint guideline developed by the American Cancer Society, the U.S. Multi-Society Task Force on Colorectal Cancer, and the American College of Radiology and individual guidelines developed by the Institute for Clinical Systems Improvement, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, and the American College of Radiology. GUIDANCE STATEMENT 1: ACP recommends that clinicians perform individualized assessment of risk for colorectal cancer in all adults. GUIDANCE STATEMENT 2: ACP recommends that clinicians screen for colorectal cancer in average-risk adults starting at the age of 50 years and in high-risk adults starting at the age of 40 years or 10 years younger than the age at which the youngest affected relative was diagnosed with colorectal cancer. GUIDANCE STATEMENT 3: ACP recommends using a stool-based test, flexible sigmoidoscopy, or optical colonoscopy as a screening test in patients who are at average risk. ACP recommends using optical colonoscopy as a screening test in patients who are at high risk. Clinicians should select the test based on the benefits and harms of the screening test, availability of the screening test, and patient preferences. GUIDANCE STATEMENT 4: ACP recommends that clinicians stop screening for colorectal cancer in adults over the age of 75 years or in adults with a life expectancy of less than 10 years.

ACG Clinical Guidelines — evidence on screening intervals states there are no RCTs comparing various screening intervals and the optimal interval to repeat FOBT/FIT is not known; in the Minnesota FOBT trial long-term follow-up, CRC mortality was reduced by 33% with annual screening and by 18% with biennial screening, and for now, annual FIT screening is recommended. After a negative screening colonoscopy, studies show benefit of a low risk of CRC for at least 10 years and up to 20 years, with Lee et al. reporting a 46% and 88% reduced risk of CRC and CRC related deaths up to 12 years after a negative colonoscopy (HR 0.54; 95% CI 0.31–0.94 and 0.12; 95% CI 0.02–0.82, respectively).

ACG Clinical Guidelines — colonoscopy quality metrics for screening: We recommend that all endoscopists performing screening colonoscopy should measure their individual cecal intubation rates (CIRs), adenoma detection rates (ADRs), and withdrawal times (WTs). We suggest that colonoscopists with ADRs below the recommended minimum thresholds (< 25%) should undertake remedial training. We recommend that colonoscopists spend at least 6 min inspecting the mucosa during withdrawal. We recommend that colonoscopists achieve a CIR of at least 95% in screening subjects.

Conclusions on CRC screening implementation — Despite multiple modalities, nearly one-third of the eligible US population is unscreened, and CRC screening rates must be optimized to reach the aspirational target of > 80%; FIT is a widely accepted and cost-effective noninvasive 2-step CRC test optimal for programmatic screening when systems navigate patients into colonoscopy, and colonoscopy is a 1-step CRC screening test that is the final common pathway for a positive noncolonoscopy screening test and the most appropriate screening test for individuals with a family history of CRC.

Recommendations — quality indicators for colonoscopy: "We recommend that all endoscopists performing screening colonoscopy should measure their individual cecal intubation rates (CIRs), adenoma detection rates (ADRs), and withdrawal times (WTs)". Strength: "Strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence for ADR, low-quality evidence for WT, and CIR". "We suggest that colonoscopists with ADRs below the recommended minimum thresholds (< 25%) should undergo remedial training". Strength: "Conditional recommendation, very low-quality evidence". "We recommend that colonoscopists achieve WTs of at least 6 minutes in screening subjects". Strength: "Strong recommendation, low-quality evidence". "We recommend that colonoscopists achieve CIRs of at least 95% in screening subjects". Strength: "Strong recommendation, low-quality evidence".

Recommendations of Others

Many organizations have issued guidelines on screening for colorectal cancer. There is a general consensus that average-risk adults aged 50 to 75 years should be screened. The American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP), American College of Physicians (ACP), American Cancer Society (ACS), and the US Multi-Society Task Force (which includes the American College of Gastroenterology, American Gastroenterological Association, and American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy) all recommend routine colorectal cancer screening in this age group, although specific recommended tests and frequency of screening may vary. Currently, where recommendations and guidelines vary is the age to initiate screening. In 2017, the US Multi-Society Task Force recommended beginning screening at age 45 years in Black adults (weak recommendation) and screening at age 40 years (or 10 years before the age at diagnosis of a family member, whichever is earlier) in persons with a family history for colorectal cancer. In 2018, the ACS recommended that screening begin at age 45 years in all adults (qualified recommendation). The AAFP's recommendations do not address screening before age 50 years. In 2021, the American College of Gastroenterology suggested screening in average-risk persons aged 45 to 49 years (conditional recommendation) and recommended screening average-risk persons aged 50 to 75 years (strong recommendation).

Generally, guidelines agree that screening should either be individualized in older adults aged 76 to 85 years (ACS, AAFP, and US Multi-Society Task Force) or stopped altogether (ACP), with clear consensus that screening should stop after age 85 years.

Initiating colorectal cancer (CRC) screening at age 45 years — epidemiology, modeling, and resource implications — includes: A relative increase of 51% in CRC incidence among individuals younger than 50 years between 1974 and 2013, and modeling using 2 of 3 Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Network models found starting at age 45 years was on the efficiency spectrum and would yield approximately 25 more life-years gained per 1,000 individuals screened vs starting at 50 years. Incidence trends also show CRC among individuals age 50–64 years increased by 1% annually between 2011 and 2016, and persons born around 1990 have twice the risk of colon cancer and 4 times the risk of rectal cancer compared with those born around 1950. Disadvantages include resources to screen an additional 21 million individuals ages 45–49 and potential diversion from achieving the 80% screening target in older adults; current screening uptake is close to 60% (57.9% ages 50–64 and 62.4% ages 50–75). A Markov analysis found that elevating screening in persons 50–75 to 80% would prevent 3 times as many CRC deaths for approximately 66% less cost.

Aspirin chemoprevention — recommendations and randomized trial evidence in colorectal cancer (CRC) include guidance that We suggest low-dose aspirin in individuals between the ages of 50–59 years with a cardiovascular disease risk of ≥ 10% over the next 10 years, who are not an increased risk for bleeding and willing to take aspirin for at least 10 years to reduce the risk of CRC (conditional recommendation; low-quality evidence), and We recommend against the use of aspirin as a substitute for CRC screening (strong recommendation, low-quality evidence). In a randomized trial, 39,876 women in the United States were assigned to aspirin 100 mg every other day or placebo, and after an average of 10.1 years there was no effect on CRC incidence (RR 0.97, 0.77–1.24); during 18-year follow-up a reduced incidence was observed with aspirin (HR 0.80, 0.67–0.97), including a decrease in proximal colon cancer (HR 0.73, 0.55–0.95), with a magnified effect when restricted to posttrial events (HR 0.58, 0.42–0.80). In the Physicians Health Study, 22,071 healthy male physicians ages 40–84 years were randomized to aspirin 325 mg every other day vs placebo for 5 years, and the study found no association between aspirin and CRC (RR 1.15, 0.80–1.65).

CRC screening in elderly individuals — timing of benefit and risk–benefit balance — notes that the benefits of polypectomy are delayed by 7–10 years after screening, making screening of limited benefit for those not expected to live at least a further 7–10 years. Evidence indicates elderly individuals derive lower or less benefit than younger counterparts in life expectancy gains, and in an analysis of elderly individuals age between 70 and 94 years the risk of screening-related complications was higher than the estimated benefit from screening in the oldest age groups.

### ACG clinical guideline: genetic testing and management of hereditary gastrointestinal cancer syndromes [^5671de84]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2015). Medium credibility.

Lynch syndrome (LS) colorectal cancer (CRC) surveillance — colonoscopy recommendation and supporting data: In individuals at risk for or affected with LS, screening for CRC by colonoscopy should be performed at least every 2 years, beginning between ages 20 and 25 years, and annual colonoscopy should be considered in confirmed mutation carriers (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence for screening and very low quality of evidence for annual surveillance and age of initiation). LS patients develop fewer (usually < 10) early-onset adenomas, and the adenoma–carcinoma dwell time is estimated at 35 months compared with 10–15 years in sporadic cancer. Lifetime CRC risk for MLH1 and MSH2 mutation carriers ranges from 22 to 74%, and among MSH6 carriers the cumulative risk by age 70 years is 39% in women versus 69% in men. The mean age of CRC diagnosis in LS is 44–61 years compared with 69 years in sporadic cases, and uptake of colonoscopic surveillance was associated with 65% (P = 0.003) less death from CRC compared with refusal.

### ACR appropriateness criteriaColorectal cancer Screening [^69903420]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

This review summarizes the relevant literature regarding colorectal screening with imaging. For individuals at average or moderate risk for colorectal cancer, CT colonography is usually appropriate for colorectal cancer screening. After positive results on a fecal occult blood test or immunohistochemical test, CT colonography is usually appropriate for colorectal cancer detection. For individuals at high risk for colorectal cancer (eg, hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer, ulcerative colitis, or Crohn colitis), optical colonoscopy is preferred because of its ability to obtain biopsies to detect dysplasia. After incomplete colonoscopy, CT colonography is usually appropriate for colorectal cancer screening for individuals at average, moderate, or high risk. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

In a comparative study enrolling 321 individuals at 14 centers, the sensitivity of CTC and CCE for polyps ≥ 6 mm was 32% and 84%, respectively, and for ≥ 10 mm was 30% and 84%, respectively; the reasons why CTC had low diagnostic yield are unknown. At this time, CTC and CCE are options for individuals unable to undergo colonoscopy or fecal immunochemical test (FIT) when locally available and reimbursed, and both tests require a follow-up diagnostic colonoscopy if positive.

Colorectal cancer screening adherence — programmatic and patient/provider strategies — includes the following directives: We recommend organized screening programs to improve adherence to CRC screening compared with opportunistic screening. To improve screening uptake, We suggest the following strategies to improve adherence to screening: patient navigation, patient reminders, clinician interventions, provider recommendations and clinical decision support tools. For follow-up after a positive test, We suggest the following strategies to improve adherence to follow-up of a positive screening test: mail and phone reminders, patient navigation, and provider interventions.

Table 1 — samples of practice guidelines for initiating colorectal cancer (CRC) screening in average-risk adults — reports that in average-risk adults, all practice guidelines gave a strong recommendation to begin CRC screening at age 50 y with any test, and most practice guidelines gave a weak or qualified recommendation to begin CRC screening in average-risk adults at age 45 y with any test. American Cancer Society: Begin screening at age 45 y with any test (qualified recommendation); screen adults between ages 50 and 75 y with any test (strong recommendation). American College of Gastroenterology: Begin screening adults between ages 45 and 49 y (conditional recommendation); screen adults between ages 50 and 75 y (strong recommendation); colonoscopy every 10 y or FIT every 1 y as primary screening modalities (strong recommendation); flexible sigmoidoscopy every 5–10 y, multitarget stool DNA test every 3 y, CT colonography every 5 y, or colon capsule every 5 y (conditional recommendation). USMSTF: Begin screening at age 45 y (weak recommendation); begin screening at age 50 y if no prior screening completed (strong recommendation). US Preventive Services Task Force: Screen adults between ages 50 and 75 y (Grade A); begin screening adults between ages 45 and 49 y (Grade B); selectively screen adults aged 76–85 y (Grade C). National Comprehensive Cancer Network: Begin screening at age 45 y with any test. Two practice guidelines (American College of Gastroenterology and USMSTF) recommended a tiered approach of screening tests to use, with tier 1 tests including a colonoscopy every 10 y or FIT every 1 y.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for rectal cancer, more specifically with respect to surveillance after curative-intent therapy, USMSTF 2016 guidelines recommend to perform the next colonoscopy after 3 years (4 years after surgery or perioperative colonoscopy) and then 5 years (9 years after surgery or perioperative colonoscopy) after the 1-year colonoscopy. Perform subsequent colonoscopies at 5-year intervals until the benefit of continued surveillance is outweighed by diminishing life expectancy. Decide on intervals between colonoscopies in accordance with published guidelines for polyp surveillance intervals if neoplastic polyps are detected. Do not use these intervals in patients with Lynch syndrome.

### Colorectal cancer screening: recommendations for physicians and patients from the U.S. multi-society task force on colorectal cancer [^3fa4e8a8]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

This document updates the colorectal cancer (CRC) screening recommendations of the U.S. Multi-Society Task Force of Colorectal Cancer (MSTF), which represents the American College of Gastroenterology, the American Gastroenterological Association, and The American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy. CRC screening tests are ranked in 3 tiers based on performance features, costs, and practical considerations. The first-tier tests are colonoscopy every 10 years and annual fecal immunochemical test (FIT). Colonoscopy and FIT are recommended as the cornerstones of screening regardless of how screening is offered. Thus, in a sequential approach based on colonoscopy offered first, FIT should be offered to patients who decline colonoscopy. Colonoscopy and FIT are recommended as tests of choice when multiple options are presented as alternatives. A risk-stratified approach is also appropriate, with FIT screening in populations with an estimated low prevalence of advanced neoplasia and colonoscopy screening in high prevalence populations. The second-tier tests include CT colonography every 5 years, the FIT-fecal DNA test every 3 years, and flexible sigmoidoscopy every 5 to 10 years. These tests are appropriate screening tests, but each has disadvantages relative to the tier 1 tests. Because of limited evidence and current obstacles to use, capsule colonoscopy every 5 years is a third-tier test. We suggest that the Septin9 serum assay (Epigenomics, Seattle, Wash) not be used for screening. Screening should begin at age 50 years in average-risk persons, except in African Americans in whom limited evidence supports screening at 45 years. CRC incidence is rising in persons under age 50, and thorough diagnostic evaluation of young persons with suspected colorectal bleeding is recommended. Discontinuation of screening should be considered when persons up to date with screening, who have prior negative screening (particularly colonoscopy), reach age 75 or have < 10 years of life expectancy. Persons without prior screening should be considered for screening up to age 85, depending on age and comorbidities. Persons with a family history of CRC or a documented advanced adenoma in a first-degree relative age < 60 years or 2 first-degree relatives with these findings at any age are recommended to undergo screening by colonoscopy every 5 years, beginning 10 years before the age at diagnosis of the youngest affected relative or age 40, whichever is earlier. Persons with a single first-degree relative diagnosed at ≥ 60 years with CRC or an advanced adenoma can be offered average-risk screening options beginning at age 40 years.

Alternate imaging tests — computed tomographic colonography (CTC) and colon capsule (CC) are described for individuals who refuse colonoscopy or fecal immunochemical test (FIT) or are not candidates for colonoscopy. CTC is FDA approved for imaging the colon in patients with previously incomplete colonoscopy or in patients with lower gastrointestinal bleeding who are at high risk to undergo a colonoscopy. CC performance has improved, and in a prospective study of 884 average-risk individuals, 79% of CCs could be completed with sensitivity 81% and specificity 93% for adenomas ≥ 6 mm; for polyps ≥ 10 mm, sensitivity and specificity were 80% and 97%, respectively.

Adenoma detection rate (ADR) and postcolonoscopy colorectal cancer (PCCRC) outcomes — variability, thresholds, and risk: Detection performance is operator dependent, and "Adenoma detection typically varies between colonoscopists in the same group by ≥ 3-fold on a per patient basis and up to 10-fold on a per adenoma basis". In 2015, minimum recommended ADR thresholds were "increased to 25% overall, 30% in men, and 20% in women", specified "for screening colonoscopies only with a cecal intubation and only conventional exams so that SSL were excluded from the definition". ADR predicts cancer risk: in a Polish screening program of "45,026 patients", colonoscopists with "ADR < 20%" had a "more than 10-fold higher rate of PCCRC" than those with higher ADRs; another study found decreased PCCRC risk for physicians with "ADR > 33.5% compared with those with ADR of < 19.06%". Moreover, "each 1% increase in ADR was associated with a 3% reduction in the incidence of CRC and a 5% reduction in fatal CRC".

Lynch syndrome (LS) — for individuals at risk for or affected with LS, screening for colorectal cancer by colonoscopy should be performed at least every 2 years, beginning between ages 20 and 25 years, and annual colonoscopy should be considered in confirmed mutation carriers (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence for screening, and very low quality of evidence for annual surveillance and age of initiation). Colectomy with ileorectal anastomosis (IRA) is the preferred treatment when colon cancer or colonic neoplasia is not controllable by endoscopy, with segmental colectomy an option if regular postoperative surveillance is conducted (conditional recommendation, moderate quality of evidence). Hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy should be offered to known LS mutation carriers who have finished child bearing, optimally at age 40–45 years (conditional recommendation, low quality of evidence). Screening for endometrial cancer and ovarian cancer should be offered by endometrial biopsy and transvaginal ultrasound annually, starting at age 30 to 35 years before surgery or if surgery is deferred (conditional recommendation, very low quality of evidence). Screening for gastric and duodenal cancer can be considered by baseline esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) with gastric biopsy at age 30–35 years with treatment of H. pylori when found, and ongoing surveillance every 3–5 years may be considered if there is a family history of gastric or duodenal cancer (conditional recommendation, very low quality of evidence). Screening beyond population-based recommendations for urinary tract, pancreas, prostate, and breast cancers is not recommended unless there is a family history (conditional recommendation, low quality of evidence). Although daily aspirin may decrease cancer risk in LS, the evidence is not sufficiently robust or mature to make a recommendation for its standard use (conditional recommendation, moderate quality of evidence).

Lynch syndrome — colonoscopy screening in hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer shows reduced colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence and mortality, with observed effects including "62% Less CRC in screened (P = 0.03)" and "No deaths in screened vs. 5 deaths in nonscreened", and on follow-up "62% reduction in CRC in screened (P = 0.02)" with "No deaths from CRC in screened vs. 9 deaths in nonscreened". An additional series found an "Estimated 72% decrease in CRC death in screened individuals". More frequent colonoscopy was associated with "Earlier stage CRC", and colectomy extent affected 10‑year risk: "15.7% risk of CRC with partial vs. 3.4% with subtotal colectomy at 10 years".

### Screening tests for colorectal cancer: a menu of options remains relevant [^c164c663]. Current Oncology Reports (2006). Low credibility.

Until the early 1990s, no evidence was available to show that screening for colorectal cancer (CRC) by any means actually saved lives. Subsequently, sufficient evidence for the efficacy of fecal occult blood testing (FOBT) and flexible sigmoidoscopy allowed the US Preventive Services Task Force to publish guidelines for CRC screening. Since that time the major organizations in the United States concerned with screening guidelines have recommended a menu of screening test options including FOBT, flexible sigmoidoscopy, flexible sigmoidoscopy plus FOBT, barium enema, and colonoscopy. No organization, except for the American College of Gastroenterology, has designated any one of these options as "preferred". Nevertheless, the lay press and many gastroenterology opinion leaders have encouraged Americans to have only one test — colonoscopy. In this review we discuss the rationale for caution in designating one screening test as "the best" and present information on how new stool and serum tests can be used effectively to screen for CRC.

ASCRS colon cancer guideline methods — the update scope, evidence search, and grading are summarized as follows: The guideline is based on the previous colon cancer parameter published in 2017 and includes 11 new, 10 updated, and 2 excluded recommendations. Searches and screening identified 241 unique Embase titles (with 10 added to qualitative synthesis) plus 35 from embedded references, yielding 7958 unique citations; after screening, 1921 individual citations were selected for potential inclusion and 328 were included in the reference list. Recommendations were assigned using the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system, and ASCRS guidelines are updated approximately every five years.
