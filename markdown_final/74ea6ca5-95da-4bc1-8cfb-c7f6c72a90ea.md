Modified scarbossa

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the modified Sgarbossa criteria for acute myocardial infarction in the setting of left bundle branch block and ventricular paced rhythms, including their evolution, diagnostic performance, application, limitations, and integration with contemporary guidelines and the occlusion MI paradigm. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical problem and why diagnosing MI in LBBB/paced rhythms is hard. Then, I should review the original Sgarbossa criteria and their performance. Next, I will examine the Smith modification and its validation. After that, I need to check how these criteria apply to ventricular paced rhythms. Then, I should evaluate newer approaches like the Barcelona algorithm. I will then integrate guideline recommendations, including the 2022 ACC expert consensus. Next, I should consider limitations, false positives/negatives, and measurement issues. Finally, I will synthesize a practical clinical algorithm and close with key takeaways anchored to evidence and the OMI paradigm shift.

> Let me first confirm the clinical problem: LBBB and ventricular pacing create fixed repolarization abnormalities that mask and mimic ischemic ST-T changes, so standard STEMI criteria fail and delays to reperfusion are common, with historically low sensitivity for identifying occlusion in this setting [^112zxvhN] [^111mtigj].

> I need to review the original Sgarbossa criteria to ground the discussion. They use a weighted score (0–10) and define MI as likely when the total is ≥ 3, with three components: concordant ST elevation ≥ 1 mm in leads with positive QRS, concordant ST depression ≥ 1 mm in V1–V3, and excessively discordant ST elevation ≥ 5 mm in leads with negative QRS. These were specific but insensitive, with meta-analytic sensitivity around 20% and specificity near 98%, meaning a positive score is highly specific but a negative score cannot safely exclude MI [^1157HKGQ] [^111mtigj].

> Wait, let me verify the performance implications. That high specificity supports cath lab activation when the score is ≥ 3, but the low sensitivity explains frequent missed occlusions, a trade-off that directly influenced guideline shifts away from treating "new LBBB" as a STEMI equivalent in isolation [^1166UAYr] [^1115mhiu].

> Next, I should review the Smith-modified Sgarbossa criteria. The key innovation was replacing the arbitrary " ≥ 5 mm discordant ST elevation" with a proportional rule: discordant ST elevation ≥ 1 mm with ST/S ratio ≤ −0.25 (or ST/S ratio ≥ 0.25 for discordant ST depression), which improved sensitivity substantially while maintaining specificity. The unweighted approach means any single positive criterion is sufficient, which simplifies triage in the ED [^114cW8ip] [^114Kq8gj].

> Hold on, I should verify the validation data. The derivation showed sensitivity ~91% and specificity ~90%, and a subsequent validation achieved sensitivity ~80% with specificity ~99%, confirming that the modified rule is more sensitive than the original and retains high specificity, with excellent interobserver agreement in related work [^114cW8ip] [^112q8PjH] [^112Umcds].

> I will now examine application to ventricular paced rhythms. Mechanistically, paced ventricles produce LBBB-like repolarization patterns, so the Smith-modified criteria have been extrapolated to paced rhythms, and a multicenter study demonstrated higher sensitivity for occlusion MI than the original Sgarbossa rule (81% vs 56%) with high specificity (96%), supporting their use in paced patients when clinical suspicion is present [^116opEeW] [^114Kq8gj].

> But wait, what if we can do better than modified Sgarbossa? The Barcelona algorithm extends concordant ST depression to any lead and adds disproportionate discordant ST deviation ≥ 1 mm in leads with low QRS voltage (max R or S ≤ 6 mm), which markedly increases sensitivity to ~93–95% while preserving specificity around 89–94% in derivation and validation cohorts. However, I should confirm external validation status — most data are single-center and need replication before universal adoption [^112SfuzZ] [^1137cBCT] [^1141d9ju].

> Next, I should review guideline integration. The 2022 ACC expert consensus explicitly recognizes that new LBBB is not a STEMI equivalent and endorses the Smith-modified Sgarbossa criteria as specific tools to identify occlusion in LBBB/paced rhythms, recommending emergent angiography when these criteria are positive and emphasizing that absence of ischemic ECG changes does not exclude ACS, prompting use of hs-cTn pathways and clinical judgment [^114Kq8gj] [^114NydyH] [^11533YaH].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I need to check limitations and pitfalls. False positives can occur with ventricular hypertrophy, electrolyte disturbances, and pre-existing repolarization abnormalities. False negatives reflect the intrinsic sensitivity ceiling of ECG-only approaches. Measurement variability, especially for small ST amplitudes and ratios, can sway classification. And echocardiography has limited standalone diagnostic value in stable LBBB patients, reinforcing the need to integrate ECG criteria with troponins and clinical context rather than relying on any single modality [^113Voswm] [^116gz4he] [^112K7f8h].

> Let me consider the broader paradigm shift from STEMI to occlusion MI. Contemporary data show STEMI criteria miss a substantial fraction of acute coronary occlusions, whereas OMI-focused interpretation — including Smith-modified Sgarbossa and reciprocal change patterns — improves early detection of occlusion and may reclassify NSTEMI patients with occluded arteries, aligning treatment with underlying pathology rather than ECG labels alone [^1179g2eg] [^1112zhKJ].

> I should double-check the practical clinical algorithm: in any patient with LBBB or paced rhythm and suspected ACS, apply the Smith-modified Sgarbossa criteria. If any criterion is positive, activate the cath lab for emergent angiography. If negative but suspicion remains high, proceed with hs-cTn 0/1–2 hour pathways and consider serial ECGs. If suspicion persists despite negative ECGs and initial troponins, escalate to early invasive evaluation. Throughout, integrate hemodynamics, symptoms, and risk, and remember that a negative modified Sgarbossa does not exclude MI, so clinical judgment remains paramount [^114Kq8gj] [^114NydyH] [^11533YaH].

> In summary, the Smith-modified Sgarbossa criteria transform a low-sensitivity, high-specificity original rule into a clinically actionable tool with markedly improved sensitivity and preserved specificity, validated in LBBB and increasingly supported in paced rhythms. When combined with guideline-directed troponin strategies and the OMI framework, they reduce missed occlusions and facilitate timely reperfusion while minimizing false activations, though clinicians must remain vigilant for exceptions and integrate multimodal data at the bedside [^112q8PjH] [^116opEeW] [^114Kq8gj] [^1179g2eg].

The **modified Sgarbossa criteria** improve detection of acute coronary occlusion in LBBB or paced rhythms by replacing the absolute ≥ 5 mm discordant ST elevation with a proportional **ST/S ratio ≥ 0.25**, increasing sensitivity while maintaining high specificity [^114cW8ip] [^112q8PjH] [^116opEeW]. Apply the criteria when LBBB or paced rhythm is present with ischemic symptoms: any concordant ST elevation ≥ 1 mm, concordant ST depression ≥ 1 mm in V1–V3, or discordant ST elevation ≥ 1 mm with ST/S ratio ≥ 0.25 is positive and warrants **emergent angiography** [^114Kq8gj] [^11533YaH]. The criteria are less sensitive than standard STEMI rules, so a negative result does not exclude occlusion; integrate with troponins, echo, and clinical judgment [^112K7f8h] [^11533YaH].

---

## Historical background and rationale for modification

The original Sgarbossa criteria used a fixed ≥ 5 mm threshold for discordant ST elevation, which was highly specific but insensitive, missing many occlusions [^111mtigj]. Smith et al. replaced this with a proportional rule — ST elevation ≥ 1 mm with ST/S ratio ≥ 0.25 — to better detect disproportionate discordant ST deviation indicative of occlusion [^114cW8ip].

---

## Components of the modified Sgarbossa criteria

| **Criterion** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Concordant ST elevation | ≥ 1 mm ST elevation in leads with concordant QRS polarity (same direction as QRS) |
| Concordant ST depression | ≥ 1 mm ST depression in leads V1–V3 (concordant with negative QRS) |
| Discordant ST elevation | ≥ 1 mm ST elevation in leads with discordant QRS polarity, with ST/S ratio ≥ 0.25 (ST elevation ≥ 25% of the preceding S-wave depth) |

---

## Diagnostic performance

The modified criteria outperform the original: sensitivity ~80–91% and specificity ~90–99% for acute coronary occlusion in LBBB, compared with ~49% sensitivity and ~98% specificity for the original rule [^112q8PjH] [^114cW8ip]. In ventricular paced rhythms, sensitivity is ~81% with specificity ~96%, supporting application to paced ECGs [^116opEeW].

---

## Clinical application and limitations

- **Clinical application**: Use when LBBB or paced rhythm is present with ischemic symptoms; any positive criterion should prompt emergent angiography [^11533YaH].
- **Limitations**: Sensitivity is imperfect; false positives can occur with LVH, electrolyte disturbances, or baseline ST changes. Always interpret in clinical context and with troponins and echocardiography [^112K7f8h].

---

## Integration with contemporary guidelines

Contemporary guidelines endorse the modified Sgarbossa criteria for LBBB and paced rhythms, emphasizing their specificity and utility in identifying occlusion MI equivalents. They also stress that new LBBB alone is not a STEMI equivalent and that ECG interpretation must be integrated with clinical assessment and biomarkers [^11533YaH] [^114Kq8gj].

---

## Practical clinical approach

- **Step 1**: Identify LBBB or paced rhythm with ischemic symptoms.
- **Step 2**: Apply modified Sgarbossa criteria.
- **Step 3**: If any criterion is positive, activate the cath lab for emergent angiography [^11533YaH].
- **Step 4**: If negative but suspicion remains high, use high-sensitivity troponins, echocardiography, and serial ECGs to guide management [^112K7f8h] [^11533YaH].

---

The modified Sgarbossa criteria provide a practical, evidence-based way to detect occlusion MI in LBBB or paced rhythms, but they must be applied alongside clinical judgment and adjunctive testing to avoid missed occlusions.

### Adding short to left gastric artery embolization for the treatment of obesity: safety and effectiveness [^113Emca8]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose

This study assessed the safety and effectiveness of a technical modification that involves adding short gastric artery (SGA) embolization to left gastric artery (LGA) embolization.

Material and Methods

This retrospective single-center study analyzed twenty obese patients (median age of 53.5 (30–73)) who were not eligible for bariatric surgery and underwent bariatric embolization with 300–500-µm microspheres in addition to a lifestyle counseling program between March 2021 and July 2022. Eight patients had LGA+SGA embolization, and twelve had LGA embolization alone. The primary outcome measure was total body weight loss (TBWL) at 6 months in the SGA+LGA and the LGA-only cohorts. Safety was assessed, defined as the 30-day adverse events rate according to the SIR classification.

Results

The mean 6-month post-embolization TBWL in the SGA+LGA cohort was 7.3 kg (95%CI 2.1–12.4; p = .01) and 4.1 kg (95%CI 0.4–8.6; p = 0.034) in the LGA-only cohort (mean difference -3.1 kg ± 2.8; 95%CI (-9.1–2.8); p = .28). The mean 6-month post-embolization TBWL in the entire cohort was 5.3 kg (p < .01). The rate of complications was similar between the two groups.

Conclusion

Combined SGA and LGA embolization is safe and effective to treat obesity. Larger studies are needed to determine whether SGA+LGA embolization results in more significant weight loss than LGA embolization alone.

### The left bundle-branch block puzzle in the 2013 ST-elevation myocardial infarction guideline: from falsely declaring emergency to denying reperfusion in a high-risk population. are the sgarbossa criteria ready for prime time? [^1166UAYr]. American Heart Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Prompt and accurate identification of ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) in the presence of left bundle-branch block (LBBB) remains difficult. The 2004 STEMI guideline recommended emergent reperfusion therapy to patients with suspected ischemia and new or presumably new LBBB. These recommendations have led to frequent false catheterization laboratory activation and inappropriate fibrinolytic therapy because most patients with suspected ischemia and new or presumably new LBBB do not have acute coronary artery occlusion on angiography. The new 2013 STEMI guideline makes a drastic change by removing previous recommendations. Therefore, patients with suspected ischemia and new or presumably new LBBB would no longer be treated as STEMI equivalent. The new guideline fails to recognize that some patients with suspected ischemia and LBBB do have STEMI, and denying reperfusion therapy could be fatal. The Sgarbossa electrocardiography criteria are the most validated tool to aid in the diagnosis of STEMI in the presence of LBBB. A Sgarbossa score of ≥ 3 has a superb specificity (98%) and positive predictive value for acute myocardial infarction and angiography-confirmed acute coronary occlusion. Thus, we propose a diagnosis and triage algorithm incorporating the Sgarbossa criteria to quickly and accurately identify, among patients presenting with chest pain and new or presumably new LBBB, those with acute coronary artery occlusion. This is a high-risk population in which reperfusion therapy would be denied by the 2013 STEMI guideline. Our algorithm will also significantly reduce false catheterization laboratory activation and inappropriate fibrinolytic therapy, the inevitable consequence of the 2004 STEMI guideline.

### Identifying acute myocardial infarction in ventricular-paced patients: the effectiveness of modified sgarbossa criteria [^114zcKhN]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Screening for acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in patients with ventricular pacemakers (VP) is a diagnostic challenge. We report a case where application of the Modified Sgarbossa criteria (mSC) would have immediately identified AMI in a patient with a VP and merited strong advocacy for emergent cardiac catheterization. A 94-year-old male with VP presented to the emergency department (ED) after he had burning sensation in his chest. Initial ECG demonstrated > 5 mm of discordant ST elevation in leads III and aVF which gave him 2 points per original Sgarbossa Criteria (oSC) and not meeting criteria for activation for cardiac catheterization. An ECG at three and a half hours after arrival demonstrated a dynamic change with new V2 concordant depression. At this point, the concordant depression (3 points) and excessive discordance (2 points) gave him a total of 5 points, which then met the oSC for activation of cardiac catheterization (≥ 3 points). Troponin I value (ng/mL) at 0/2/4 h after ED arrival are 0.02, 0.08 and 4.33 respectively. Pain never recurred after single nitroglycerine (NTG) tablet upon arrival. He was urgently taken for catheterization and had acute right coronary artery (RCA) culprit lesion and discharged on hospital day 4. This case report highlighted the benefits of applying mSC to patients with VP, which to authors knowledge remains unvalidated. A significant benefit of mSC is that they are unweighted, thus any positive criteria is suggestive of AMI. While the first EKG yielded an oSC score < 3, applying the unweighted mSC to the EKG revealed ≤ -0.25 ST/S ratio discordant changes in leads III, aVF, I and aVL would have merited strong advocacy for emergent cardiac catherization.

### Diagnosis of ST-elevation myocardial infarction in the presence of left bundle branch block with the ST-elevation to S-wave ratio in a modified sgarbossa rule [^114cW8ip]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Study Objective

Sgarbossa's rule, proposed for the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction in the presence of left bundle branch block, has had suboptimal diagnostic utility. We hypothesize that a revised rule, in which the third Sgarbossa component (excessively discordant ST-segment elevation as defined by ≥ 5 mm of ST-segment elevation in the setting of a negative QRS) is replaced by one defined proportionally by ST-segment elevation to S-wave depth (ST/S ratio), will have better diagnostic utility for ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) equivalent, using documented coronary occlusion on angiography as reference standard.

Methods

We collected admission ECGs for all patients with an acutely occluded coronary artery and left bundle branch block at 3 institutions. The ECGs of emergency department patients with chest pain or dyspnea and left bundle branch block, but without coronary occlusion, were used as controls. The R or S wave, whichever was most prominent, and ST segments, relative to the PR segment, were measured to the nearest 0.5 mm. The ST/S ratio was calculated for each lead that has both discordant ST deviation of greater than or equal to 1 mm and an R or S wave of opposite polarity; others were set to 0. The cut point for the most negative ST/S ratio with at least 90% specificity was determined. The revised rule is unweighted, requiring just 1 of 3 criteria. Diagnostic utilities of the original and revised Sgarbossa rules were computed and compared. McNemar's test was used to compare sensitivities and specificities.

Results

The study and control groups included 33 and 129 ECGs, respectively. The cut point selected for relative discordant ST-segment elevation was -0.25. Excessive absolute discordant ST-segment elevation of 5 mm was present in at least one lead in 30% of ECGs in patients with confirmed coronary occlusion versus 9% of the control group, whereas excessive relative discordant ST-segment elevation less than -0.25 was present in 79% vs. 9%. Sensitivity of the revised rule in which ST-segment elevation with an ST/S ratio less than or equal to -0.25 replaces ST-segment elevation greater than or equal to 5 mm was significantly greater than either the weighted (P < .001) or unweighted (P = 0.008) Sgarbossa rule: 91% (95% confidence interval [CI] 76% to 98%) versus 52% (95% CI 34% to 69%) versus 67% (95% CI 48% to 82%). Specificity of the revised rule was lower than that of the weighted rule (P = 0.002) and similar to that of the unweighted rule (P = 1.0): 90% (95% CI 83% to 95%) versus 98% (95% CI 93% to 100%) versus 90% (95% CI 83% to 95%). Positive and negative likelihood ratios for the revised rule were 9.0 (95% CI 8.0 to 10) and 0.1 (95% CI 0.03 to 0.3). The revised rule was significantly more accurate than both the weighted (16% difference; 95% CI 5% to 27%) and unweighted (12% difference; 95% CI 2% to 22%) Sgarbossa rules.

Conclusion

Replacement of the absolute ST-elevation measurement of greater than or equal to 5 mm in the third component of the Sgarbossa rule with an ST/S ratio less than -0.25 greatly improves diagnostic utility of the rule for STEMI. An unweighted rule using this criterion resulted in excellent prediction for acute coronary occlusion.

### From ST-segment elevation MI to occlusion MI: the new paradigm shift in acute myocardial infarction [^1179g2eg]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

A prospective analysis of STEMI criteria on the initial ECG found they were only 35% sensitive for adjudicated STEMI(including serial ECGs) and 21% for OMI(including non-STEMI with OMI on angiogram) and the recent meta-analysis found a pooled sensitivity of only 43.6% of STEMI criteria for OMI. Large meta-analyses of non-STEMI patients have found that 25% have a totally occluded arteryand 34% have Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) flow grade 0 to 1, with nearly double the mortality of non-STEMI without OMI, in spite of younger age and fewer comorbidities.

" Failure of existing rules is the prelude to a search for new ones".

Emergency physician Dr Stephen Smith led the search for new rules for occlusion, and answered the questions raised by the 1994 report: a formula to differentiate between early repolarization and subtle LAD occlusion, reciprocal STD in aVL to identify subtle inferior OMI and exclude pericarditis, T/QRS ratio to differentiate between old LV aneurysm and anterior STEMI with Q-wave, and the Smith-Modified Sgarbossa criteria to identify OMI in LBBB and paced rhythms.

Throughout the STEMI paradigm, cardiologists and emergency physicians have continued to find patterns of occlusion and reperfusion that do not fit into the STEMI box: Wellens reperfusion T-wave inversion at risk for reocclusion, de Winter T waves indicating LAD occlusion, "South African flag sign" to identify first diagonal occlusion, Aslanger pattern of inferior OMI with concomitant high-grade stenosis, ischemic STD maximum V₁–V₄ to identify posterior OMI and differentiate it from subendocardial ischemia. These advances reveal the limitations of the STEMI paradigm (Tables 1 and 2).

Chronic coronary disease appropriate use criteria — asymptomatic patients without known ASCVD were restructured: these scenarios are "significantly modified", and for ASCVD screening they were "modified based on the categories of 10-year ASCVD risk and the presence of risk-enhancing factors".

### 2022 ACC expert consensus decision pathway on the evaluation and disposition of acute chest pain in the Emergency department: a report of the American college of cardiology solution set oversight committee [^114NydyH]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2022). High credibility.

Electrocardiogram interpretation and CDP eligibility — risk classification — states that the absence of ischemic ECG changes identifies patients at relatively lower (although not necessarily low) risk for MI but is not sufficient for excluding ACS; therefore, these patients are appropriate for evaluating using a CDP. All CDPs exclude patients with ischemic ST-segment elevation; however, many do not specifically exclude those with other ECG findings potentially associated with ischemia. We recommend that patients with new ischemic ECG changes should be considered high risk and undergo evaluation and treatment according to current NSTE-ACS guidelines and not be entered into an accelerated CDP. For the purposes of this document, ECGs are classified into 3 groups: STEMI or equivalent; ischemic ST-segment or T-wave abnormalities; and nonischemic, which includes normal, nonspecific findings, left ventricular hypertrophy with or without repolarization ST-T wave changes, and left or right bundle branch block or paced rhythm not meeting Sgarbossa or modified Sgarbossa criteria for MI.

### Practice parameter: diagnosis of dementia (an evidence-based review). Report of the quality standards subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology [^115VpnJS]. Neurology (2001). Medium credibility.

Vascular dementia (VaD) — criteria in current use include the State of California Diagnostic and Treatment Criteria, the National Institute for Neurological Disorders and Stroke and Association Internationale pour la Recherche et l'Enseignement en Neurosciences (NINDS-AIREN) criteria, the Hachinski Ischemic Score (HIS) as modified by Rosen, and DSM-IV. Across studies comparing clinical diagnosis with neuropathology, these criteria had "very low sensitivity but higher specificity", and, with one exception, results "had the same diagnostic accuracy as the population-based studies", again showing low sensitivity with higher specificity. Neuropathologic analyses emphasized distinguishing "some or any" vascular lesions from "pure" vascular pathology, and the Hachinski Ischemic Score "may be more suitable for identifying the majority of dementia patients with vascular disease… because of the low sensitivity of the NINDS-AIREN and California criteria".

### Diagnosis of ST-elevation myocardial infarction in the presence of left bundle branch block with the ST-elevation to S-wave ratio in a modified sgarbossa rule [^113vSZxE]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "Modified Sgarbossa's criteria for MI in left bundle branch block" for ST-elevation myocardial infarction and non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction.

The Modified Sgarbossa's Criteria is a clinical calculator used for diagnosing myocardial infarction (MI) in patients with a pre-existing left bundle branch block (LBBB) or ventricular paced rhythm. This calculator is particularly useful in the emergency department setting where rapid diagnosis of MI is critical.

The Modified Sgarbossa's Criteria applies to patients presenting with chest pain or other symptoms suggestive of MI who have an ECG showing LBBB or a ventricular paced rhythm. These ECG patterns can make it difficult to diagnose MI using standard criteria, hence the need for the Modified Sgarbossa's Criteria.

The clinical utility of this calculator is to aid in the diagnosis of MI in this specific patient population, which can guide appropriate treatment and management decisions.

There are no specific exclusion criteria for the use of the Modified Sgarbossa's Criteria. However, it should be noted that this calculator is not intended to replace clinical judgment and should be used in conjunction with other clinical findings and diagnostic tests.

The Modified Sgarbossa's criteria calculator evaluates the likelihood of a myocardial infarction (MI) in the context of a left bundle branch block (LBBB) by examining three critical electrocardiographic features. By reviewing each feature and applying a defined scoring system, it offers a systematic way to assess the presence of MI.

Here's how it works:

1. **ST elevation ≥ 1 mm concordant with the QRS complex in at least one lead**:
	- Answering "Yes" earns 1 point.
	- Answering "No" earns 0 points.

2. **ST depression ≥ 1 mm in lead V1, V2, or V3**:
	- Answering "Yes" earns 1 point.
	- Answering "No" earns 0 points.

3. **Excessively discordant ST deviation**:
	- This feature is identified based on an ST/S ratio in any lead showing > 1 mm ST-segment elevation or depression.
	- **Scoring**:
		- Answering "Yes" earns 1 point.
		- Answering "No" earns 0 points.

After evaluating these inputs, the calculator sums the points to produce a total score ranging from 0 to 3. A higher total score suggests a stronger indication of MI.

Interpretation of the score is straightforward:

- A score of 1 or more supports the criteria for myocardial infarction, highlighting an increased probability of MI when LBBB is present.
- A score of 0 indicates that the criteria for myocardial infarction are not met, implying a lower likelihood of MI given the context.

This systematic approach aids healthcare professionals in making informed clinical decisions about potential coronary events in patients with complex ECG patterns due to LBBB.

### Consensus based definition of growth restriction in the newborn [^115EqQgw]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

To develop a consensus definition of growth restriction in the newborn that can be used clinically to identify newborn infants at risk and in research to harmonize reporting and definition in the current absence of a gold standard.

Study Design

An international panel of pediatric leaders in the field of neonatal growth were invited to participate in an electronic Delphi procedure using standardized methods and predefined consensus rules. Responses were fed back at group-level and the list of participants was provided. Nonresponders were excluded from subsequent rounds. In the first round, variables were scored on a 5-point Likert scale; in subsequent rounds, inclusion of variables and cut-offs were determined with a 70% level of agreement. In the final round participants selected the ultimate algorithm.

Results

In total, 57 experts participated in the first round; 79% completed the procedure. Consensus was reached on the following definition: birth weight less than the third percentile, or 3 out of the following: birth weight < 10th percentile; head circumference < 10th percentile; length < 10th percentile; prenatal diagnosis of fetal growth restriction; and maternal pregnancy information.

Conclusions

Consensus was reached on a definition for growth restriction in the newborn. This definition recognizes that infants with birth weights < 10th percentile may not be growth restricted and that infants with birth weights > 10th percentile can be growth restricted. This definition can be adopted in clinical practice and in clinical trials to better focus on newborns at risk, and is complementary to the previously determined definition of fetal growth restriction.

### Development and evaluation of modified criteria for infant and toddler anaphylaxis [^112j2aqi]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Current clinical criteria for identifying anaphylaxis do not account for unique aspects of infant anaphylaxis presentation and have not been validated in patients younger than 2 years of age. This may contribute to under recognition and is thus an unmet need.

Objective

To demonstrate age-specific signs and symptoms that more accurately identify anaphylaxis in young children and to develop and compare modified criteria for "likely anaphylaxis" against the widely used 2006 National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases/Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis Network (NIAID/FAAN) criteria.

Methods

Retrospective chart review of 337 clinical encounters presenting with suspected allergic or anaphylactic reactions to a pediatric emergency department. Modified criteria for likely anaphylaxis were developed and evaluated against the NIAID/FAAN criteria.

Results

The study population included 33% infants (age < 12 mo), 39% toddlers (age 12 mo to < 36 mo), and 29% children (age ≥ 36 mo). The NIAID/FAAN criteria captured 85% of all patient encounters in the study and the modified criteria captured 98% (P < .001). Compared with NIAID/FAAN criteria, modified criteria had 22.8% improved performance among infants (p < .001) and 10.3% improved performance among toddlers (P = 0.04).

Conclusions

We developed modified anaphylaxis clinical criteria that incorporated symptoms specific to infants and young children. The modified criteria increased identification of anaphylaxis in infants and potentially toddlers. Future research is needed to validate our findings on a larger cohort.

### New electrocardiographic algorithm for the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction in patients with left bundle branch block [^112GjydF]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Results

The study included 484 patients divided into 3 groups: (1) a derivation cohort formed by 163 patients who were referred for pPCI between October 2009 and December 2014, (2) a validation cohort including 107 patients referred for pPCI from January 2015 until June 2018, and (3) a control group of 214 patients with LBBB and no suspected acute coronary syndrome. The 2 cardiologists who analyzed the ECGs agreed completely on the evaluation of the Sgarbossa criteria. There were 4 cases (1.5%) of disagreement concerning the Modified Sgarbossa Criteria and 2 cases (0.7%) of disagreement with the BARCELONA algorithm, all in patients referred for pPCI. The Cohen's kappa coefficient was 0.96 for the Modified Sgarbossa criteria and 0.98 for the BARCELONA algorithm.

Baseline Characteristics of Patients Referred for pPCI

There were no significant differences in terms of cardiovascular risk factors, cardiac history, and in‐hospital death between the derivation and the validation samples (Table 1).

Table 1
Clinical Characteristics of the Study Population

AMI was diagnosed in 61 patients (37%) in the derivation cohort and in 40 patients (37%) in the validation sample. As compared with those without a diagnosis of AMI, patients with AMI were more frequently men, had higher prevalence of diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, and prior myocardial infarction, as well as lower left ventricular ejection fraction (Table 1). Clinical and angiographic details of patients with AMI are presented in Table 2. There were no significant differences in AMI characteristics and severity between the derivation and validation cohort (Table 2). Overall, the clinical presentation of the AMI was often severe: 40% of patients were in Killip class III or IV, the median left ventricular ejection fraction was 40%, and the in‐hospital mortality was 15%.

### New ECG criteria for acute myocardial infarction in patients with left bundle branch block [^1141d9ju]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Further Studies

The high sensitivity and specificity of the new Barcelona algorithm require to be assessed in an independent population, either manually or with automated techniques. It sometimes happens that criteria developed in one center do not perform so well when evaluated in another center. On the other hand, it could be argued that the established Sgarbossa criteria performed similarly in the Barcelona validation sample as in the original study. 2 Nevertheless, few ECG criteria have been shown through the years to be the order of 93% to 94% sensitive and specific and only time will tell whether the outstanding performance of the criteria set out in the article of Di Marco et al 1 will stand the test of independent assessment.

ECG Example

With the above discussion in mind, the reader is encouraged to review again the ECG of Figure 1. Measurements quoted below were derived from automated analysis of the ECG using software from the author's laboratory. 10

The leads of most interest are V2 and V4. The ST amplitude in V2 is 0.542 mV, meeting one of the Sgarbossa criteria, but this does not produce a score sufficient to report AMI. The S‐wave amplitude in V2 is 2.841 mV and so in this lead |STj/Samp| = 0.19 and so the modified Sgarbossa criteria 3 are not met. This criterion was not met in any other lead. The new Barcelona criterion of discordant ST deviation ≥ 0.1 mV is met in V4, where ST amplitude is 0.105 mV and the dominant S wave is 0.482 mV and hence ≤ 0.6 mV. In summary, this ECG should be reported as showing AMI according to the new Barcelona criteria.

### Evaluation of T-Wave morphology in patients with left bundle branch block and suspected acute coronary syndrome [^112GZfoq]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

T-wave morphology in the setting of left bundle branch block (LBBB) has been proposed as an indicator of myocardial ischemia.

Objectives

We sought to identify T-wave morphology findings in patients with LBBB that predict non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). We hypothesized that two or more contiguous leads with concordant T waves would be predictive of NSTEMI.

Methods

This was a retrospective cohort study performed by chart review in a tertiary care center emergency department. We identified a consecutive cohort who presented with LBBB and symptoms consistent with acute coronary syndrome. Exclusion criteria were diastolic blood pressure > 120 mm Hg, heart rate > 130 beats/min, positive pressure ventilation, potassium > 5.5 mEq/L, and cardiac arrest without prearrest electrocardiogram (ECG) available. We collected ECGs and classified T waves into five categories based on morphology, blinded to clinical outcome. Clinical outcome data were collected blinded to ECG findings. Those with ECG diagnostic of STEMI by modified Sgarbossa criteria were excluded from the primary analysis, which was sensitivity and specificity of two or more contiguous leads with concordant T waves for NSTEMI.

Results

There were 246 patients included. Mean age was 73 years; 160 (65%) were female, and 32 had myocardial infarction. Thirty percent had two or more contiguous precordial leads with partially or completely concordant T waves. For NSTEMI, the sensitivity and specificity of this finding were 19% (95% confidence interval [CI] 8–37) and 68% (95% CI 61–74).

Conclusions

We found no clinically useful relationship between T-wave concordance and myocardial infarction in our patient population. Future investigation of LBBB T-wave morphology should focus on alternative populations and findings.

Most current guidelines do not provide clear recommendations as to which type of charts should be used to monitor the growth of twins, 143, 236, 237 while other guidelines specifically recommend the use of singleton‐based charts 238 or twin‐specific charts. 239 As a result, singleton‐based standards are used by default in most centers to assess the growth of twins. However, recent data provide support to the hypothesis that the relative smallness of twins is a benign adaptive mechanism and, therefore, for the use of twin‐specific charts. For example, several studies suggest that the slower growth of twins is the result of differences in programming that is determined as early as the first trimester. 229, 240, 241, 242, 243 In addition, it was found that the use of twin‐specific (versus singleton‐based) charts was associated with a marked decrease in the rate of twins classified as SGA, without affecting the detection rate of stillbirth, suggesting that twin‐specific charts can be used safely. 227, 244, 245 Similar findings were reported in studies that investigated the association between the type of chart used (twin versus singleton charts) and other outcomes such as perinatal complications and long‐term morbidity. 246, 247 Studies that investigated placental pathology findings reported that SGA twins (based on singleton charts) are less likely to have placental histopathological evidence of placental insufficiency when compared with SGA singletons. 248, 249 In another recent study on the association between SGA and pre‐eclampsia, it was found that in contrast to singletons, the diagnosis of SGA in twins based on singleton charts was not associated with a greater risk of pre‐eclampsia, while the association of SGA in twins diagnosed using twin‐specific charts had the same magnitude of association with pre‐eclampsia to that observed between SGA and pre‐eclampsia in singletons. 63 Overall, these findings provide support to the hypothesis that the relative smallness of twins is less likely to be the result of placental insufficiency and, thus, less likely to reflect true growth restriction. Based on that, we believe that it seems reasonable to use twin‐specific charts for the assessment of fetal growth in twin gestations, as this has the potential to avoid overdiagnosis of FGR and the consequences associated with this diagnosis. 246 This approach is supported by the recent guidelines of the International Society of Ultrasound in Obstetrics and Gynecology (ISUOG). 239 Of note, the diagnosis of FGR in twin gestations should also take into consideration intertwin size discordance, especially in the case of monochorionic placentation. 250

### Unraveling the spectrum of left bundle branch block in acute myocardial infarction: insights from the assessment of the safety and efficacy of a new thrombolytic (ASSENT 2 and 3) trials [^112uxvkK]. American Heart Journal (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Left bundle branch block (LBBB) complicates the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction (AMI). The Sgarbossa criteria were developed from GUSTO I to surmount this diagnostic challenge but have not been prospectively validated in a large population with presumed AMI. We evaluated their utility in the diagnosis and risk stratification of AMI patients in ASSENT 2 & 3.

Methods

Baseline electrocardiograms (ECG) of LBBB patients were scored using Sgarbossa's criteria (0–10) by 2 readers blinded to the CK/CK-MB data and clinical outcomes; 267 (1.2%) patients had LBBB on their baseline ECG.

Results

Among 253 LBBB patients with available peak CK/CK-MB data, 158 (62.5%) had peak CK/CK-MB levels > 2x ULN, thereby qualifying for the diagnosis of AMI. A Sgarbossa score of 3 was shown in 48.7% of LBBB patients with elevated CK/CK-MB versus in 12.6% of those without a CK/CK-MB rise (P < .001). Patients with higher Sgarbossa scores, ie, 3, had a higher mortality compared with those with a score < 3, (23.5% vs 7.7% at 30 days P < .001; and 33.7% vs 20.2% at 1 year, P < .001, respectively).

Conclusions

Our findings validate the utility of Sgarbossa criteria for diagnosing AMI in the setting of LBBB. These criteria provide a simple and practical diagnostic approach to risk stratify this diagnostically challenging high-risk group and optimize risk-benefit of acute therapy.

4.2.2 Early‐ versus late‐onset FGR

It has been suggested that FGR should be broadly classified, based on gestational age at the time of diagnosis, into early‐onset FGR (< 32 weeks) and late‐onset FGR (≥ 32 weeks). The rationale underlying this classification is based on differences between these two phenotypes of FGR in severity, natural history, Doppler findings, association with hypertensive complications, placental findings, and management. 16, 17, 18

Early‐onset FGR has a prevalence of 0.5%–1%, is usually more severe, and is more likely to be associated with abnormal umbilical artery Doppler than late‐onset FGR. The underlying placental pathology is frequently similar to that observed in cases of early‐onset pre‐eclampsia (maternal vascular malperfusion), which explains the strong association of early‐onset FGR with pre‐eclampsia. Therefore, early‐onset FGR is usually easier to detect, and the natural history tends to follow a predictable sequence of Doppler changes in the umbilical artery and ductus venosus. The main challenge in cases of early‐onset FGR is management (i.e. timing of delivery), by attempting to determine the optimal balance between the opposing risks of stillbirth and prematurity. 19

Late‐onset FGR is more common than early‐onset FGR with a prevalence of 5%–10%. In contrast to early‐onset FGR, it is usually milder, is less likely to be associated with pre‐eclampsia, and is usually associated with normal umbilical artery Doppler. Therefore, the main challenge with regard to late‐onset FGR is diagnosis, while management (i.e. delivery) is relatively simple given that the diagnosis is commonly made during the late‐preterm or term periods, where the risks associated with delivery are relatively small. The diagnosis of late‐onset FGR mainly relies on adaptive changes in the cerebral circulation ("redistribution" or "brain‐sparing effect"), which is reflected by low resistance to flow in the middle cerebral artery thereby generating a low cerebroplacental ratio, as described in section 8.1.7. Given that the umbilical artery and ductus venosus Doppler studies are usually normal in cases of late‐onset FGR, the natural history in these cases is less predictable and there is a risk of sudden decompensation and stillbirth. 16, 19

The Sgarbossa criteria can be used to identify patients who have acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in the presence of left bundle branch block, which obscures the usual changes associated with ST elevation myocardial infarction. Patients with ventricular paced rhythm have ECG changes with similar morphology to left bundle branch block. A short-cut systematic review was carried out to establish whether the Sgarbossa criteria can accurately diagnose AMI in the presence of ventricular paced rhythm. Three studies were directly relevant to the question. The author, date and country of publication, patient group studied, study type, relevant outcomes, results and study weaknesses of these papers are tabulated. The clinical bottom line is that.

Summary of mSASSS changes after 2 years of treatment in studies assessing effects on progression of radiographic damage in patients with AS

The mean change in mSASSS may serve as a primary end point measure in randomized and controlled prospective studies comparing different interventions, but to date this has not been performed. There is no universally agreed upon mSASSS cut-off value defining radiographic progression and it is debatable whether choosing a high or low mSASSS threshold is preferable. While a number of studies have defined progression as an increase of ⩾2 mSASSS units over 2 years, other studies have defined radiographic progression as any change in mSASSS of > 0 U over time. Spinal radiographic progression over 2 years has been further classified, according to Baraliakos et al. as slow (< 2 mSASSS units), moderate (2–5 mSASSS units) or fast (> 5 mSASSS units). Table 1 provides a summary of mSASSS changes after 2 years of treatment with NSAIDs and biologic therapies in studies assessing effects on progression of radiographic damage in patients with AS.

### Smith-modified sgarbossa criteria and paced rhythms: a Case report [^116BoykS]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

As the incidence of left bundle branch blocks (LBBBs) and paced-rhythms electrocardiograms (ECGs) increase in the aging global population, the need for rapid and accurate diagnosis of ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) or STEMI equivalents in patients with these rhythms becomes more imperative. The Sgarbossa and Smith-modified Sgarbossa criteria have been documented to enhance the diagnosis of STEMI in the setting of LBBBs. However, there is a growing body of literature that suggests that these criteria can also be applied for the diagnosis of STEMI in patients with paced rhythms.

Case Report

We present the case of an 84-year old man who was on admission for cellulitis when he developed acute respiratory distress. An ECG revealed findings that were consistent with positive Smith-modified Sgarbossa criteria, upon which the diagnosis of STEMI was made. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Although the sensitivity and specificity of these criteria in paced rhythms is not well documented, if a patient meets these criteria in an appropriate clinical setting, cardiac catheterization laboratory activation by an emergency physician could be appropriate.

### New electrocardiographic algorithm for the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction in patients with left bundle branch block [^112SfuzZ]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

ECG Analysis in the Validation Cohort

Sgarbossa and Modified Sgarbossa rules showed a high specificity (up to 99%) but a limited sensitivity (28%–68%) (Table 3), confirming the results of the derivation cohort.

A max (R|S) voltage value ≤ 6 mm (0.6 mV) also achieved the highest efficiency (81%) and highest area under the ROC curve (0.77) among the cutoff values tested to define a low‐voltage QRS where disproportionate discordant ST deviation ≥ 1 mm (0.1 mV) is suggestive of AMI (Figure 5). Likewise, the validation cohort confirmed that, extending the analysis of concordant ST depression ≥ 1 mm (0.1 mV) to any ECG lead (instead of limiting it to leads V1–V3) resulted in a significant increase of diagnostic sensitivity (from 10% to 40%; P < 0.01).

The BARCELONA algorithm attained a 93% sensitivity, which was significantly higher than that of the Sgarbossa and Modified Sgarbossa rules (P < 0.01 and P < 0.01, respectively). It also reached the highest negative predictive value (96%) and maintained a 94% specificity, which was not inferior to Sgarbossa and Modified Sgarbossa rules (Tables 3 and 7). The global performance of the BARCELONA algorithm was significantly better than previous algorithms: It achieved the highest efficiency (94%) and the highest area under the ROC curve (0.93), which was significantly higher (P < 0.01) than the ones obtained by the Sgarbossa and Modified Sgarbossa rules (Figure 6).

Comparison of the Main Algorithms Regarding Sensitivity and Specificity for AMI in the Validation Sample

Diagnostic Yielding of the ECG in the Entire Cohort of Patients Referred for pPCI

The application of a Sgarbossa score ≥ 3 and the Modified Sgarbossa rules in our entire cohort of 270 patients with LBBB referred for pPCI (101 diagnosed with AMI) would have missed 67 and 36 patients with AMI, respectively. By contrast, the BARCELONA algorithm would have missed only 6 patients.

The influence of coronary reperfusion on the electrocardiographic algorithms could be evaluated in 75 patients with AMI in whom an ECG recorded within the first 48 hours after pPCI was available. After pPCI, the BARCELONA algorithm became negative in 93% of patients with AMI who were positive before reperfusion.

### Classification criteria in idiopathic inflammatory myopathies: is It time for an update? [^1122BVFm]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2025). Medium credibility.

Since Bohan-Peter criteria, several classification criteria for idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIM) have been proposed reflecting the advancements in understanding of these diseases over the years. This created a strong foundation for development of the first data-derived IIM criteria. Since its publication in 2017, European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology (EULAR)-American College of Rheumatology (ACR) IIM criteria have been widely used in studies, demonstrating good performance across various populations. However, the emergence of new IIM subtypes and advancements in diagnostics have exposed gaps in the criteria, necessitating a revision. This article summarizes the historical evolution of the IIM classification criteria and outlines the key reasons for revision of the EULAR-ACR criteria.

### New ECG criteria for acute myocardial infarction in patients with left bundle branch block [^116Lo8TJ]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Sensitive and specific criteria for the detection of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in patients with left bundle branch block (LBBB) have eluded electrocardiographers for many years. The article by Di Marco et al in this issue of the Journal of the American Heart Association (JAHA) 1 suggests that enhanced criteria are a possibility. In 1996, Sgarbossa et al introduced new criteria for the diagnosis of AMI in LBBB purely on the basis of ST changes, with a sensitivity of 36%, a specificity of 96%, and a positive predictive value of 88%. 2 At the time, they represented a new approach, but they were enhanced later by Smith et al, whose modified Sgarbossa criteria 3 had a sensitivity of 91% and a specificity of 90%, although the study group was somewhat small. 3 A follow‐up case‐control study that assessed the same criteria produced results of 80% sensitivity and 99% specificity in 45 patients with an acute coronary occlusion and 249 controls. 4 The modification of Smith et al 3 was to replace one Sgarbossa criterion (STj ≥ 0.5 mV discordant with QRS) with a new criterion, namely |STj/Samp| ≥ 0.25 with STj ≥ 0.1 mV in the same lead.

In the article by Di Marco et al, the sensitivity and specificity in the test group of 107 patients were 93% and 94%, respectively. 1 This compares with 33% and 99% for the original Sgarbossa 2 criteria and 68% and 94% for the modified Sgarbossa criteria, 3, 4 all based on the same test population of patients. Thus, the new approach represents a remarkable improvement in sensitivity, in particular compared with earlier approaches.

### Association of timing of electrocardiogram acquisition after return of spontaneous circulation with coronary angiography findings in patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest [^1125juYM]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Evaluation of ECG Findings

Two cardiologists at each participating center evaluated all ECGs; these cardiologists were blinded to both the coronary angiography findings and the time elapsed between the ROSC and the ECG acquisition. In case of doubtful interpretation, a third cardiologist was asked to provide an additional interpretation. The rhythm, heart rate, QRS duration, corrected QT value, intraventricular conduction, arrhythmias, and segments with ST elevation (anterior, lateral, posterior, inferior, and right) were analyzed for each ECG. In addition, each ECG was categorized as either diagnostic or not diagnostic of STEMI according to the criteria of the electrocardiographic diagnosis of STEMI recommended by the 2017 European Society of Cardiology guidelines for the management of acute myocardial infarction. The isolated ST-segment depression in leads V1 to V3 was considered diagnostic of posterior STEMI without the need of confirmation by the posterior leads, considering the clinical picture of a resuscitated patients with OHCA. The criteria proposed by Sgarbossa et alwere considered in the presence of a left bundle branch block.

Evaluation of Coronary Angiography Findings

For patients who had undergone coronary angiography, we assessed the presence of significant coronary stenosis, the number of vessels in which stenosis was present, and the execution of any PTCA by analyzing the procedure report. If the report was not exhaustive, an interventional cardiologist who was blinded to the patient's post-ROSC ECG was asked to evaluate the coronary angiography. Coronary artery stenosis was defined as significant if it was greater than 50% for the left main coronary artery and greater than or equal to 75% for the other coronary vessels.

Definitions

On the basis of the post-ROSC ECG and coronary angiography findings, the study population was divided into 4 groups. Those with true-positive ECG findings were patients who had post-ROSC ECG findings that met STEMI criteria and had obstructive coronary artery disease worthy of PTCA confirmed by angiography. Patients with true-negative ECG findings included those who had post-ROSC ECG findings that did not meet STEMI criteria and did not have obstructive coronary artery disease worthy of PTCA confirmed by angiography. Patients with false-positive ECG findings included those who had post-ROSC ECG findings that met STEMI criteria but did not have obstructive coronary artery disease worthy of PTCA by angiography. Patients with false-negative ECG findings included those who had post-ROSC ECG findings that did not meet STEMI criteria but who had obstructive coronary artery disease that was worthy of PTCA on angiography.

4.2.1 Consensus‐based definition of placenta‐related FGR

The major member societies of FIGO follow a definition using the 10th percentile as a means of diagnosing an SGA fetus, which then leads to further testing, assessment, and follow‐up. There are proposals to address the limitations of this definition, but their validity regarding reduction in adverse outcomes needs to be tested. For example, in an attempt to overcome some of the limitations described above, a consensus‐based definition for placenta‐mediated FGR has been proposed via a Delphi procedure. 1 To decrease the likelihood of false‐positive and false‐negative diagnosis of FGR, the consensus definition was based on a combination of measures of fetal size (fetal weight estimation and abdominal circumference) and abnormal Doppler findings in the umbilical, uterine, and middle cerebral arteries, as described in Box 1. The implementation of this definition is limited by the lack of a recommendation on which growth chart should be used to define the 10th and 3rd percentiles for EFW and fetal abdominal circumference. In addition, further research is needed to correlate this definition with adverse perinatal outcomes.

Improvements in ultrasonographic imaging provide a tool for estimating placental volume using three‐ and four‐dimensional scanning techniques. Placental volume has been proposed as a marker for various obstetric complications related to defective placental function, including FGR. 117, 118 A systematic review estimating the value of first‐trimester 3D placental volume for the prediction of SGA found a detection rate of 24.7% at a 10% false‐positive rate. 119 Another parameter is the placental quotient, defined as the ratio of the placental volume to the fetal crown–rump length. The placental quotient was reported to have a high negative predictive value for perinatal complications but was not very useful when used for screening of SGA in a low‐risk population, with a sensitivity of 27.1%. 120 The discriminatory ability of placental volume alone for SGA appears to be modest, but may be integrated into a multivariable screening model. However, the use of 3D placental volume as a routine screening tool for FGR is limited by the need for proper equipment and training required to obtain these measurements in a reproducible manner.

5.4 Prediction models

Currently there is no single screening test sufficiently predictive of FGR to recommend routine clinical use. Investigations are underway to combine various tests, but such prediction models have not been sufficiently validated in terms of outcomes studies and therefore must be considered investigative protocols at this time. In a prospective cohort of 4970 women, the combination of first‐trimester maternal serum PAPP‐A, beta hCG, maternal blood pressure, and uterine artery Doppler performed in the first trimester had a detection rate of 73% for early SGA (< 34 weeks) but only 32% for late SGA (≥ 34 weeks). 19 A different model that included maternal characteristics, first‐trimester blood pressure, uterine artery pulsatility index, PlGF, and sFlt‐1 was evaluated in a larger cohort of 9150 women and achieved a detection rate of 86% for early‐onset FGR and 66% for late‐onset FGR, both at a false‐positive rate of 10%. 19, 121 In the second trimester, the SCOPE consortium examined 5606 healthy nulliparous women with singleton pregnancies and found that the combination of clinical risk factors, 15‐week biomarkers (53 biomarkers were used), and 20‐week ultrasound (fetal biometry and Doppler studies of the umbilical and uterine arteries) had only a moderate detection rate for SGA below the 10th percentile, with a positive predictive value of 32% and a negative predictive value of 91%. 122

The McDonald criteria include MRI evidence for dissemination in space and dissemination in time for the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis in young adult patients who present with clinically isolated syndromes (CIS) typical of the disease. Although a major advance, the criteria have limited sensitivity for making an early diagnosis.

Objective

To compare the performance of McDonald criteria and modified McDonald criteria for dissemination in space and time for assessing the development of clinically definite multiple sclerosis.

Methods

McDonald criteria were modified using the combination of a less stringent definition for dissemination in space and allowing a new T2 lesion per se after three months as evidence for dissemination in time. Modified and McDonald criteria were applied in 90 CIS patients at baseline and at three month follow up scans.

Results

Both criteria were highly specific (> 90%) but the modified criteria were more sensitive (77% v 46%) and more accurate (86% v 73%).

Conclusions

These modified criteria should be evaluated in other CIS cohorts.

### The prevalence of fibromyalgia in the general population: a comparison of the American College of Rheumatology 1990, 2010, and modified 2010 classification criteria [^115HGcnc]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

The American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 1990 fibromyalgia classification criteria are based on the presence of widespread pain and tenderness. In 2010, new criteria were proposed that focused more on multiple symptoms, and these criteria were later modified to require only self report of symptoms. The current study aimed to determine the population prevalence of fibromyalgia and to compare differences in prevalence using the alternative criteria.

Methods

A cross-sectional survey was conducted. Questionnaires, including items on pain, symptoms, and rheumatologic diagnoses, were mailed to 4,600 adults in northeast Scotland. Participants who had chronic widespread pain or those who met the modified 2010 criteria, plus a subsample of other participants, were invited to attend a research clinic. Attendees completed an additional questionnaire and underwent a rheumatologic examination, and their signs and symptoms were classified according to the ACR 1990, 2010, and modified 2010 criteria. The prevalence of fibromyalgia according to each set of criteria was calculated, weighting back to the target population by age, sex, and area of residence.

Results

Of 1,604 questionnaire participants, 269 were invited to attend the research clinic, and 104 (39%) attended; 32 of these subjects (31%) met ≥ 1 set of fibromyalgia criteria. The prevalence of fibromyalgia according to the 1990, 2010, and modified 2010 criteria was 1.7% (95% confidence interval [95% CI] 0.7–2.8), 1.2% (95% CI 0.3–2.1), and 5.4% (95% CI 4.7–6.1), respectively. The ratio of females to males was 13.7:1, 4.8:1, and 2.3:1 of those meeting the respective criteria sets.

Conclusion

Fibromyalgia prevalence varies with the different sets of classification criteria applied. In particular, prevalence is higher and a greater proportion of men are identified with the modified 2010 criteria as compared to the criteria sets requiring clinician input. This has important implications for the use of the new criteria, both in research and in clinical practice.

### Assessment of five different guideline indication criteria for spirometry, including modified GOLD criteria, in order to detect COPD: data from 5, 315 subjects in the PLATINO study [^111vHFNy]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Indication of spirometry for the diagnosis of COPD

In order to identify the most effective criteria for the screening of COPD, we compared the number of individuals who met the criteria for spirometry assessment according to GOLD-modified, ACCP, NHLEP, GOLD and ATS/ERS and the presence or absence of COPD diagnosis (Table 5). GOLD-modified had the lowest number of individuals with indication for spirometry (41.3%). On the contrary, GOLD and ATS/ERS criteria had the highest indication for spirometry (80.4%).

The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive (PPV) and negative predictive values (NPV) for the COPD screening criteria are presented in Table 6. The GOLD-modified criteria showed the lowest sensitivity (54.9%) — i.e. the subjects with COPD that were correctly identified, and the highest specificity (61%) — i.e. the number of individuals without COPD who were identified correctly. GOLD and ATS/ERS criteria showed the highest sensitivity (87.9%) and the lowest specificity (20.8%).

The PPV and NPV analysis showed a small variability among the different criteria. The PPV varied from 15.6% for the GOLD and ATS/ERS criteria to 19% for the GOLD-modified; the NPV varied from 89% for the GOLD-modified to 91.2% for GOLD and ATS/ERS criteria. Since NLHEP, GOLD and ATS/ERS criteria for spirometry screening are very similar, with the only difference being the age cut-off, the values for sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV were also similar.

We show the results of the best cutoffs for the max (R|S) voltage used to define low‐voltage, in the derivation and in the validation cohort separately.

We tested several ECG algorithms incorporating the new criteria (Table 4). The best performance and the highest sensitivity were obtained by the algorithm that provided the most comprehensive approach to repolarization abnormalities in LBBB and included concordant ST deviation > 1 mm (0.1 mV) in any lead and discordant ST deviation ≥ 1 mm (0.1 mV) in leads with max (R|S) voltage ≤ 6 mm (0.6 mV). This algorithm was named BARCELONA algorithm and is described in detail in Table 5.

Table 5
Definition of the BARCELONA Algorithm to Diagnose AMI in the Presence of LBBB

The BARCELONA algorithm attained the highest sensitivity (95%), significantly higher (P < 0.01) than Sgarbossa and Modified Sgarbossa rules, as well as the highest negative predictive value (97%), while maintaining 89% specificity (Table 3 and Table 6). The global performance of the BARCELONA algorithm was significantly better than previous algorithms: It achieved the highest efficiency (91%) and the highest area under the ROC curve (0.92), which was significantly higher (P < 0.01) than the ones obtained by the Sgarbossa and Modified Sgarbossa rules (Figure 6). The BARCELONA algorithm also afforded a significant improvement in the ability to predict the occurrence of an AMI, as shown by Integrated Discrimination Improvement and Net Reclassification Improvement indexes (both indexes showed P < 0.01 comparing BARCELONA algorithm with Sgarbossa and Modified Sgarbossa rules).

### FIGO (International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics) initiative on fetal growth: best practice advice for screening, diagnosis, and management of fetal growth restriction [^1122qxVu]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2021). Medium credibility.

4.2 Terminology and definitions

FGR is defined as the failure of the fetus to meet its growth potential due to a pathological factor, most commonly placental dysfunction. Clinically, this is reflected by a drop in fetal size percentiles over the course of gestation. However, fetal growth potential is difficult to determine, and serial assessments of fetal size to detect a drop in fetal weight percentile are usually not available. Instead, care providers most commonly have only a "snapshot" of fetal weight estimation at a given point in time. Therefore, in clinical practice, small for gestational age (SGA), defined as estimated fetal weight (EFW) or abdominal circumference below a certain threshold such as the 10th or 3rd percentile, is most commonly used to suspect FGR.

The use of SGA as a proxy for FGR has several limitations that need to be recognized. First, most SGA fetuses are constitutionally healthy small fetuses, whose smallness is merely the result of their predetermined growth potential (i.e. false‐positive diagnosis of FGR). Second, some growth‐restricted fetuses, depending on their original growth potential and timing of insult, may remain above the percentile threshold described above and may thus not be SGA (i.e. false‐negative diagnosis of FGR). Third, the use of SGA as a proxy for FGR is limited by the accuracy of sonographic fetal weight estimation, which has an estimation error of up to ± 15%–20%. Finally, the diagnosis of SGA is highly dependent on the growth chart being used, which can therefore have a considerable effect on the proportion of fetuses or infants flagged as SGA in a given population.

It should be noted that there is inconsistency in the literature regarding the terminology described above, where some use the term FGR to describe a fetus with an estimated weight below the 10th percentile for gestational age and the term SGA to describe an infant with birth weight below the 10th percentile for gestational age. However, for the purpose of this article, the term SGA is used to indicate an EFW or birth weight below the 10th percentile for gestational age, and the term FGR to refer to a small fetus that has failed to achieve its growth potential because of a pathologic process.

### Motor outcomes in individuals born small for gestational age at term: a systematic review [^111GMJMr]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Methods

Search strategy

A comprehensive literature search for studies investigating motor outcomes in individuals born SGA at term was carried out by one author (HT) in Medline (PubMed) and Embase in September-October 2023, combining three concepts of interest: 'SGA', 'term-born' and 'motor outcomes'. Search terms are listed in Table S1. No limitation regarding publication year was set in our query. We followed guidelines for reviewing retrieved references for inclusion in systematic reviews using EndNote by Bramer et al.

Study selection

Screening was carried out by two authors (HT and KAIE) using the following inclusion criteria: SGA exposure at term (≥ 37 weeks of gestation) and motor outcome assessed by standardized motor tests with results reported as continuous scores (mean/median) compared with a control group born appropriate for gestational age (AGA) at term. We included only articles that reported original research from cohort studies or randomized controlled trials and were available in full text in English. We excluded abstracts, editorials and commentaries.

The search produced 824 records, whereof 150 were duplicate records (Fig. 1). After screening of titles and abstracts, the remaining articles were assessed for eligibility by checking the full text against above-mentioned criteria. If results from the same cohort at the same time of assessment were reported in more than one article, the article with the larger sample was included in the review. The full-text assessment resulted in 11 articles.

Fig. 1
Flow of article selection for review. SGA: Small for gestational age, RCT: Randomized controlled trial

Seven reviews were identified in the screening process and two more in the full-text assessment. Three had no full text available, two were not in English and two did not include term SGA as exposure. We reviewed the references of the remaining reviews and identified one additional original research article. We additionally performed a free-text search using "neurodevelopmental outcome" and "small for gestational age" identifying one more article. Key characteristics of included original articles were entered into Table 1.

Quality assessment

The quality of the included studies in terms of selection, comparability and outcome was independently assessed by two authors (SDB and KADA) by using the Ottawa-Newcastle Scale for cohort studies. Assessment criteria were set for each domain (Table S2), and assessment discrepancies were resolved by discussion with a senior author (KAIE).

### Validation of the diagnosis and triage algorithm for acute myocardial infarction in the setting of left bundle branch block [^114qmPTN]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Detecting acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) in the setting of left bundle branch block (LBBB) remains a challenge to clinicians. Several diagnostic and triage algorithms have been proposed to accurately identify LBBB patients with an acute culprit vessel. We aimed to validate the algorithm proposed by Cai et al., which uses patients' hemodynamic status and the modified Sgarbossa electrocardiography criteria to guide reperfusion therapy.

Methods

This retrospective study was performed with a chart review in emergency departments (EDs) of 2 medical centers, 2 regional hospitals, and 1 local hospital. From January 2010 to December 2014, 2432 consecutive patients were diagnosed as having STEMI in the ED, including 65 patients with LBBB (2.6%).

Results

The patients with LBBB were older and more frequently presented with acute pulmonary edema (58.5% vs 22.1%, p < 0.001), cardiogenic shock (16.9% vs 6.3% p = 0.006), and VT/VF episodes (7.7% vs 2.2%, p = 0.034) and had a higher 30-day mortality rate (20.0% vs 10.4% p = 0.032) than those without LBBB. We then tested the algorithm proposed by Cai et al. and noted a sensitivity of 93.8% in identifying a culprit lesion.

Conclusions

The inconsistency of the guideline recommendations reflects the uncertainty of diagnostic and therapeutic strategies and the pressing need for tools to accurately identify the true acute myocardial infarction in patients presenting with chest pain and LBBB. The algorithm proposed by Cai et al. had good sensitivity and would allow emergency physicians to implement the timely treatment protocol for this high-risk population.

### Utility of echocardiography in patients with suspected acute myocardial infarction and left bundle-branch block [^112K7f8h]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

These findings have important and immediate clinical consequences, as they falsified the assumption underlying our hypothesis regarding the utility of echocardiography in patients with suspected AMI and LBBB as recommended in current guidelines. As these data were derived from large international diagnostic studies using central adjudication by independent cardiologists, their validity and generalizability seem high. These surprising findings seem well explained by 3 aspects. First, in most patients presenting with LBBB and AMI, LBBB is pre‐existing (known or unknown) and not the consequence of the current AMI. Second, many patients with LBBB have prior AMIs resulting in persistent WMA, which often cannot be reliably differentiated from new WMA related to a new AMI. Third, most AMIs in patients with LBBB are small to moderate in size, and not the catastrophic very large AMI phenotype resulting in LBBB as a consequence of the very large ischemic territory. As only a subgroup of patients with LBBB underwent transthoracic echocardiography in the ED, it is important to highlight that selection bias would be expected to have favored a positive finding.

Accordingly, an integrated triage algorithm including specific ECG criteria (Sgarbossa or modified Sgarbossa criteria) with high specificity, as well as high sensitivity cardiac troponin/I concentrations at presentation and their 0/1‐hour or 0/2‐hour changes should be used in the selection of patients for immediate and/or early coronary angiography. It is important to highlight that these findings only apply to patients stable enough to provide written informed consent, which was required for this study. They should not be extrapolated to patients after cardiac arrest or in cardiogenic shock, for which immediate echocardiography should definitely remain the standard of care.

In conclusion, in hemodynamically stable patients with suspected AMI and LBBB, standard echocardiographic assessment provides only limited diagnostic value regarding the presence or absence of AMI.

Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia — major criterion scope in the modified Duke criteria expanded beyond community acquisition: "In the original Duke criteria, bacteremia resulting from S aureus or enterococci was considered to fulfill a major criterion only if it was community acquired", but contemporary data showed nosocomial disease (e.g., "of 59 consecutive patients with S aureus IE, 45.8% had nosocomial infections, and 50.8% had a removable focus of infection" and "262 patients… 34 (13%) were subsequently diagnosed with definite IE"), leading to the statement that the modified criteria "recommend the inclusion of S aureus bacteremia as a major criterion, regardless of whether the infection is hospital acquired… or community acquired".

### Utility of left bundle branch block as a diagnostic criterion for acute myocardial infarction [^1115mhiu]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2011). Low credibility.

The clinical utility of new or "presumably new" left bundle branch block (LBBB) as an electrocardiographic criterion equivalent to ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction in contemporary practice is not well established. The aim of this study was to investigate the hypothesis that new or presumably new LBBB in symptomatic patients frequently leads to an overdiagnosis of acute myocardial infarction (AMI). A retrospective analysis of data from consecutive patients in the Mayo Clinic's ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction network from July 2004 to August 2009 was conducted among 892 patients, 36 (4%) of whom had new LBBB. The frequency, clinical characteristics, serum troponin levels, coronary angiographic findings, and outcomes of patients with new LBBB suspected of having AMI were evaluated. Compared with patients without LBBB (n = 856), those with new LBBB were older (64.5 vs 72.9 years, p < 0.001), had higher Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) risk scores (22.7 vs 31.0, p < 0.005), were less likely to undergo primary percutaneous coronary intervention (86% vs 22%, p < 0.001), and had longer door-to-balloon times. Only 14 patients (39%) had final diagnoses of acute coronary syndromes, of which 12 were AMI, while 13 (36%) had cardiac diagnoses other than acute coronary syndrome and 9 (25%) had noncardiac diagnoses. Of the patients with AMI, 5 had occluded culprit arteries, of which 2 involved the left anterior descending coronary artery. A Sgarbossa score ≥ 5 had low sensitivity (14%) but 100% specificity in diagnosing AMI in the presence of new LBBB. In conclusion, new or presumably new LBBB in patients suspected of having AMI identifies a high-risk subgroup, but only a small number have AMI. Two thirds of these patients are discharged from the hospital with alternative diagnoses. The Sgarbossa criteria appear to have limited utility in clinical practice because of their low sensitivity.

### Validation of the classification criteria commonly used in Korea and a modified set of preliminary criteria for Behçet's disease: a multi-center study [^113tH6Ru]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

Recently we have proposed a modified set of criteria to settle the questions raised regarding the International Study Group (ISG) criteria for Behçet's disease (BD). The aim of the present study was to validate the two pre-existing criteria sets commonly used in Korea, the ISG criteria and the criteria of the Behçet's Disease Research Committee of Japan (Japanese criteria), as well as the proposed modified criteria.

Methods

The study population included 155 consecutive patients with BD and 170 controls with non-Behçet's rheumatic diseases. Detailed data for all of the subjects were recorded prospectively by the participating physicians on a standard form that listed the clinical features of BD. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of each set of the criteria were measured.

Results

Of the three criteria sets employed, the modified criteria were the most accurate, with an accuracy of 96.3%. The ISG criteria often failed to classify the following patients with BD: patients with only oral and genital ulcerations, certain patients with intestinal ulcerations, patients who did not manifest oral ulcerations, and patients with acute disease but fewer than three recurrent oral ulceration relapses in a 1-year period. The Japanese criteria also failed to categorize the following patients with BD: patients with oral and genital ulcerations, and patients with oral ulcerations, skin lesions, and a positive pathergy reaction. In addition, the Japanese criteria misclassified some of the control subjects with non-Behçet's uveitis as having BD.

Conclusions

The results of this study suggest that there are some points that need to be reconsidered in the clinical application of the two pre-existing sets of criteria. Although the modified criteria were the most accurate, further validation studies will be required in other ethnic populations.

### New electrocardiographic algorithm for the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction in patients with left bundle branch block [^112P5JUs]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

ECG Analysis in the Derivation Cohort

The Sgarbossa and Modified Sgarbossa rules showed a high specificity (up to 98% for Sgarbossa score ≥ 3) but a low sensitivity (range, 26%–62%) for the diagnosis of AMI in the presence of LBBB (Table 3).

Table 3
Diagnostic Performance for AMI of the BARCELONA Algorithm and Previously Proposed Electrocardiographic Algorithms

The Sgarbossa rule of ST depression limited to ECG leads V1 to V3 had a sensitivity of 13%. By extending the analysis to concordant ST depression ≥ 1 mm (0.1 mV) in any ECG lead the sensitivity increased to 51% (P < 0.01) still maintaining a 97% specificity (Table 4).

Table 4
Performance of New Criteria and Different Algorithms for the Diagnosis of AMI

The best cutoff value of max (R|S) voltage indicating low‐voltage QRS with disproportionate discordant ST deviation was 6 mm (0.6 mV). This max (R|S) voltage gave the highest efficiency (86%) and the highest area under the ROC curve (0.84), significantly higher than other values (Figure 5). Thus, the new criterion was positive in the presence of discordant ST deviation ≥ 1 mm (0.1 mV) in any ECG lead with a max (R|S) voltage ≤ 6 mm (0.6 mV). Of note, in line with previous studies, 7 patients with AMI had lower QRS voltage (mean max [R|S] voltage 9.6 mm or 0.96 mV versus 10.8 mm or 0.108 mV; P = 0.01) and the median number of leads with max (R|S) voltage ≤ 6 mm (0.6 mV) was higher in patients with AMI (5 versus 3; P = 0.02).

Electrocardiogram terminology — nonischemic ECG definition includes normal or nonspecific patterns without Sgarbossa criteria. Nonischemic electrocardiogram (ECG) is defined as ECGs that are normal, have nonspecific findings, left ventricular hypertrophy with or without repolarization abnormalities, left or right bundle branch block, or paced rhythm, not meeting Sgarbossa or Modified Sgarbossa criteria for myocardial infarction.

### New electrocardiographic algorithm for the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction in patients with left bundle branch block [^113Yi7uS]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

To improve the diagnostic sensitivity of ECG in patients with LBBB and suspected AMI, we have elaborated 2 new approaches. First, since any ST deviation concordant with the QRS should be regarded as abnormal, we hypothesized that not only concordant ST elevation but also concordant ST depression might be a sign of AMI; we therefore extended the Sgarbossa rule of concordant ST depression in leads V1 to V3 to any other lead. It was hypothesized that this would cover the electrocardiographic projection of acute ischemia in different myocardial regions.

Second, we considered as a positive criterion for AMI the presence of an appreciable (≥ 1 mm or 0.1 mV) discordant ST deviation in low‐voltage QRS complexes because, in the absence of ischemia, these complexes usually show isoelectric ST‐segment potentials (Figure 1). This latter criterion had not yet been explored and required defining the best cutoff value for QRS voltage below which any discordant ST deviation ≥ 1 mm (0.1 mV) would be regarded as disproportionate and suggestive of AMI. Of note, leads with low‐voltage QRS are a frequent finding in patients with LBBB and AMI, since AMI is associated with lower QRS voltages in patients with LBBB. 8

The objective of this study was to assess whether the electrocardiographic diagnosis of AMI in the presence of LBBB improved by considering the presence of concordant ST depression in any ECG lead and the occurrence of discordant and disproportionate ST deviation in leads with low‐voltage QRS complexes.

### Prevalence of fibromyalgia in fourteen Korean tertiary care university hospital pain clinics [^114eRTRN]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

Despite improvements, the 2010 ACR criteria, as the 1990 criteria before them, also required a physician to assess the presence and severity of comorbid symptoms. In 2011, diagnostic criteria (the modified ACR 2010 criteria) were developed, which were the partially modified 2010 diagnostic criteria without the requirement for physician assessment of somatic symptoms. The modified ACR 2010 criteria could thus be implemented more easily and at a lower cost. The physician assessment of somatic symptoms was replaced with a summary score representative of three, self-reported symptoms. By using these modified ACR 2010 criteria in primary care, physicians were able to diagnose FM with adequately high sensitivity and specificity.

Despite the extensive application and use of these modified ACR criteria elsewhere, their use in assessing the prevalence of FM in Korea has not yet been investigated. There are only two epidemiological studies of FM in Korea, both of which are based on the 1990 ACR criteria. A further study compares the fit of 1990 and 2010 ACR criteria in 98 patients already diagnosed with FM. In addition, most previous studies have been conducted in patients recruited from a general population or recruited directly from rheumatology clinics. No studies have specifically assessed patients at multicenter pain clinics. Recently, it has been reported that FM presents as a continuous spectrum, rather than as a single disease form, and is often accompanied by various other chronic pain disorders. For these reasons, we targeted patients with chronic pain who visited tertiary care university hospital pain clinics for our assessments of FM in the present study. In addition, we employed the modified ACR 2010 criteria, which can be employed without a physician and thus are potentially more useful than the 1990 diagnostic criteria, which required significant physician's time and effort.

The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of FM in patients who visited outpatient pain clinics in Korea using the modified 2010 ACR criteria and to examine them for comorbid conditions that may be associated with FM.

### 'Modified STOPP-START criteria for sri lanka'; translating to a resource limited healthcare setting by Delphi consensus [^111F94vd]. BMC Geriatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In conclusion, the STOPP/START criteria were modified to overcome common issues encountered when applying the tool in low resource healthcare settings like Sri Lanka. The modified criteria included 105 criteria; 70 STOPP and 35 START criteria, indicating an 8% reduction in criteria compared to the original version. The simplified and more relevant set of criteria is expected to yield a more realistic outcome when assessing for inappropriate medication among older adults in Sri Lanka. It is expected that the modified tool will be used by medical officers or pharmacists to screen out older patients with potentially inappropriate medicines to refer for specialist care. Once validated, we hope to make the Modified STOPP/START criteria for Sri Lanka available online and accessible without a fee for healthcare professionals in Sri Lanka. We also hope to introduce this tool at undergraduate level in a relevant section of the Bachelor of Pharmacy curriculum. The modified tool could also be largely applicable to other countries with similar healthcare systems but should always be validated to the respective country before application in large scale.

### New ECG criteria for acute myocardial infarction in patients with left bundle branch block [^117Rv8ct]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Methods

In the study of Di Marco et al, 1 all ECGs were interpreted visually by 2 cardiologists and there was an exceptionally high agreement between them (κ coefficient = 0.98). Measurements > 0.1 mV (1 mm) were made to the nearest 0.05 mV. This does raise the question that if ST amplitude, for example, happened to be bordering on 0.1 mV (eg, 0.095 mV), then it could have possibly influenced a cardiologist aware of a threshold of 0.1 mV. Of course, such a situation could affect both sensitivity and specificity, but it might mean that if automated methods were used for ECG interpretation of a new test set at some future point, the results of automated versus manual interpretation could differ.

The biggest difference between the new criteria and the original Sgarbossa criteria is that the new approach is not a point scoring system. The new criteria of Di Marco et al 1 have 2 major differences compared with previous criteria:
Although the Sgarbossa criteria used ST depression ≥ 0.1 mV as a criterion for AMI only in leads V1 to V3 with a dominant Q or S wave, the new approach extends this criterion to any lead (ie, where the ST depression and the QRS complex are "concordant");
A completely new criterion, applicable in any lead, of ST deviation ≥ 0.1 mV, which is "discordant" with the QRS complex where the dominant QRS wave ≤ 0.6 mV (ie, the STj amplitude is oppositely directed to the dominant QRS deflection). Note that this is not peak to peak QRS amplitude.

These 2 new criteria, together with an existing Sgarbossa criterion (namely, ST elevation ≥ 0.1 mV), which is concordant with the QRS complex, constitute the new so‐called Barcelona algorithm, which is positive if any 1 of the 3 above mentioned criteria is met.

### Electrocardiographic diagnosis of acute coronary occlusion myocardial infarction in ventricular paced rhythm using the modified sgarbossa criteria [^116opEeW]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Study Objective

Ventricular paced rhythm is thought to obscure the electrocardiographic diagnosis of acute coronary occlusion myocardial infarction. Our primary aim was to compare the sensitivity of the modified Sgarbossa criteria (MSC) to that of the original Sgarbossa criteria for the diagnosis of occlusion myocardial infarction in patients with ventricular paced rhythm.

Methods

In this retrospective case-control investigation, we studied adult patients with ventricular paced rhythm and symptoms of acute coronary syndrome who presented in an emergency manner to 16 international cardiac referral centers between January 2008 and January 2018. The occlusion myocardial infarction group was defined angiographically as thrombolysis in myocardial infarction grade 0 to 1 flow or angiographic evidence of coronary thrombosis and peak cardiac troponin I ≥ 10.0 ng/mL or troponin T ≥ 1.0 ng/mL. There were 2 control groups: the "non-occlusion myocardial infarction-angio" group consisted of patients who underwent coronary angiography for presumed type I myocardial infarction but did not meet the definition of occlusion myocardial infarction; the "no occlusion myocardial infarction" control group consisted of randomly selected emergency department patients without occlusion myocardial infarction.

Results

There were 59 occlusion myocardial infarction, 90 non-occlusion myocardial infarction-angio, and 102 no occlusion myocardial infarction subjects (mean age, 72.0 years; 168 [66.9%] men). For the diagnosis of occlusion myocardial infarction, the MSC were more sensitive than the original Sgarbossa criteria (sensitivity 81% [95% confidence interval [CI] 69 to 90] versus 56% [95% CI 42 to 69]). Adding concordant ST-depression in V4 to V6 to the MSC yielded 86% (95% CI 75 to 94) sensitivity. For the no occlusion myocardial infarction control group of ED patients, additional test characteristics of MSC and original Sgarbossa criteria, respectively, were as follows: specificity 96% (95% CI 90 to 99) versus 97% (95% CI 92 to 99); negative likelihood ratio (LR) 0.19 (95% CI 0.11 to 0.33) versus 0.45 (95% CI 0.34 to 0.65); and positive LR 21 (95% CI 7.9 to 55) versus 19 (95% CI 6.1 to 59). For the non-occlusion myocardial infarction-angio control group, additional test characteristics of MSC and original Sgarbossa criteria, respectively, were as follows: specificity 84% (95% CI 76 to 91) versus 90% (95% CI 82 to 95); negative LR 0.22 (95% CI 0.13 to 0.38) versus 0.49 (95% CI 0.35 to 0.66); and positive LR 5.2 (95% CI 3.2 to 8.6) versus 5.6 (95% CI 2.9 to 11).

Conclusion

For the diagnosis of occlusion myocardial infarction in the presence of ventricular paced rhythm, the MSC were more sensitive than the original Sgarbossa criteria; specificity was high for both rules. The MSC may contribute to clinical decisionmaking for patients with ventricular paced rhythm.

### New ECG criteria for acute myocardial infarction in patients with left bundle branch block [^111PJjQe]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Clinical Applicability

Di Marco et al 1 point out that, in their cohort of patients referred for primary percutaneous coronary intervention, 63% unnecessarily underwent cardiac catheterization, no doubt in keeping with recommended guidelines, although the Sgarbossa criteria, with a specificity of 96%, were available, having been established in 1996. As the authors point out, the current European Society of Cardiology guidelines 11 advise that in a patient with a clinical suspicion of ongoing ischemic symptoms, an ECG showing LBBB should be regarded as an ST‐segment–elevation myocardial infarction equivalent, even if there was a previous ECG showing LBBB. These guidelines also emphasized that the presence of a (presumed) new LBBB does not predict a myocardial infarction. Nonetheless, if the new criteria can be externally validated, they could on occasion be a valuable aid in decision making.

### From ST-segment elevation MI to occlusion MI: the new paradigm shift in acute myocardial infarction [^112iexX8]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

STEMI anomalies

"Normal science often suppresses fundamental novelties because they are necessarily subversive of its basic commitments… The source of resistance is the assurance that the older paradigm will ultimately solve all its problems, that nature can be shoved into the box the paradigm provides".

Paradigms make normal science possible, but this inevitably leads to the discovery of anomalies that do not fit within the paradigm. When this happens, the normal response is to either reject these anomalies or try to absorb them into the prevailing paradigm. Even before the STEMI paradigm had fully emerged there were 3 early anomalies: anterior STD from posterior OMI, subtle inferior OMI with reciprocal STD in aVL, and Sgarbossa criteria for OMI in the presence of LBBB.

A 1994 report on emergency department diagnosis of STEMI described the challenge of ECG interpretation for borderline STE, and differentiating STEMI from early repolarization, pericarditis, LBBB, and old MI with persisting STE. In other words, by dichotomizing ECGs by presence vs absence of STE, STEMI criteria cannot differentiate between different types of STE, or identify STE secondary to an abnormal QRS with superimposed primary ischemic elevation.

As a result of the vast research catalyzed by the STEMI paradigm, years of angiographic data have demonstrated the chasm between the STEMI/non-STEMI dichotomy and the underlying pathology of OMI (Figure 3).

Figure 3
The STEMI/Non-STEMI False Dichotomy

STEMI criteria are supposed to differentiate patients with ACO from those without. But up to 25% of code STEMI have No ACO: these are appropriately termed false positives, receive a different discharge diagnosis, and are identified as a quality improvement issue. But at least 25% of "Non-STEMI" Have ACO on delayed angiography, with higher mortality. These should be recognized as false negative STEMI and identified as a quality improvement issue, but instead they are still diagnosed as "Non-STEMI". This is what we call the "no false negative paradox": In the STEMI paradigm, there cannot be a false negative diagnosis. ACO = acute coronary occlusion; ECG = electrocardiogram; other abbreviation as in Figure 1.

### New electrocardiographic algorithm for the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction in patients with left bundle branch block [^113LQGCa]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Figure 2
from a patient with acute myocardial infarction and culprit lesion in the right coronary artery, showing‐segment depression ≥ 1 mm (0.1 mV) concordant with negativepolarity in lead V5.

Figure 3
from a patient with acute myocardial infarction and culprit lesion in the left circumflex artery, showing discordantdeviation ≥ 1 mm (0.1 mV) in 2 leads with avoltage ≤ 6 mm (0.6 mV).

Figure 4
from a patient with acute myocardial infarction and culprit artery in the left main.

Discordantdeviation ≥ 1 mm (0.1 mV) in leads with max (R|S) voltage ≤ 6 mm (0.6 mV) is present in leads, and.

We hypothesized that the highest sensitivity would be achieved by an algorithm that took into account all potential aspects of repolarization abnormalities in LBBB, that is, concordant ST elevation, concordant ST depression, and disproportionate discordant ST deviation in leads with a low‐voltage QRS.

The Sgarbossa and Modified Sgarbossa Criteria were applied according to previously published definitions 4, 5 (Table S1).

Clinical Variables

In each patient, we recorded clinical and anthropometric variables, laboratory tests, and electrocardiographic and angiographic data. AMI was diagnosed in the presence of either an acute coronary artery occlusion (grade 0 of the thrombolysis in myocardial infarction flow grading) or an acute coronary lesion with thrombolysis in myocardial infarction flow ≥ 1 associated with a troponin rise and fall above the 99th percentile upper reference limit. Coronary stenosis was considered acute when signs of thrombosis or ulceration were identified by angiography.

The diagnosis of STEMI is based on electrocardiographic criteria that do not apply to patients with LBBB. To test the diagnostic performance of the Modified Sgarbossa rules, Smith and coworkers 5 elaborated a definition of STEMI equivalent based on angiographic findings and the amount of the release of biomarkers of cardiac injury. To get closer to the concept of STEMI equivalent used in the Modified Sgarbossa Criteria, we elaborated a similar definition of STEMI equivalent (see Data S1) and tested the diagnostic performance of the new electrocardiographic criteria by including patients with STEMI equivalent in a separate analysis (see Data S1 and Table S2).

### Assessment of five different guideline indication criteria for spirometry, including modified GOLD criteria, in order to detect COPD: data from 5, 315 subjects in the PLATINO study [^111T5fkw]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Spirometry is the gold standard for diagnosing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Although there are a number of different guideline criteria for deciding who should be selected for spirometric screening, to date it is not known which criteria are the best based on sensitivity and specificity.

Aims

Firstly, to evaluate the proportion of subjects in the PLATINO Study that would be recommended for spirometry testing according to Global initiative for Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD)-modified, American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP), National Lung Health Education Program (NLHEP), GOLD and American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society (ATS/ERS) criteria. Secondly, we aimed to compare the sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive and negative predictive values, of these five different criteria.

Methods

Data from the PLATINO study included information on respiratory symptoms, smoking and previous spirometry testing. The GOLD-modified spirometry indication criteria are based on three positive answers out of five questions: the presence of cough, phlegm in the morning, dyspnoea, age over 40 years and smoking status.

Results

Data from 5,315 subjects were reviewed. Fewer people had an indication for spirometry (41.3%) according to the GOLD-modified criteria, and more people had an indication for spirometry (80.4%) by the GOLD and ATS/ERS criteria. A low percentage had previously had spirometry performed: GOLD-modified (14.5%); ACCP (13.2%); NLHEP (12.6%); and GOLD and ATS/ERS (12.3%). The GOLD-modified criteria showed the least sensitivity (54.9) and the highest specificity (61.0) for detecting COPD, whereas GOLD and ATS/ERS criteria showed the highest sensitivity (87.9) and the least specificity (20.8).

Conclusion

There is a considerable difference in the indication for spirometry according to the five different guideline criteria. The GOLD-modified criteria recruit less people with the greatest sum of sensitivity and specificity.

### 2020 World Society of Emergency Surgery updated guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of acute calculus cholecystitis [^114D8yhT]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

The clinical calculator "Modified ASGE/SAGES criteria for stratification of common bile duct stones" for choledocholithiasis and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography.

The Modified American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ASGE) / Society of American Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons (SAGES) Criteria is a clinical calculator used for stratification of common bile duct stones. This scoring system is specifically applicable to patients suspected of having common bile duct stones, often presenting with symptoms such as jaundice, abdominal pain, or abnormal liver function tests.

The clinical utility of the Modified ASGE/SAGES Criteria is to predict the likelihood of common bile duct stones and guide the need for further diagnostic or therapeutic interventions, such as endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). The criteria take into account various factors including clinical symptoms, laboratory results, and imaging findings.

There are no specific exclusion criteria for the use of this calculator. However, it may not be as accurate in patients with atypical presentations or in those with other concurrent hepatobiliary diseases that could confound the clinical picture.

The Modified ASGE/SAGES criteria is a tool used to estimate the risk of common bile duct stones by evaluating certain factors. The process involves answering seven questions that relate to specific clinical indicators. Each of these factors, if present, is assigned a predetermined score, and the sum of these scores gives an overall risk level.

Here is a breakdown of how each factor contributes to the risk score:

- Age over 55 years contributes 1 point.
- Evidence of common bile duct stones on an abdominal ultrasound is a significant indicator, contributing 5 points.
- A common bile duct diameter greater than 6 mm, with the gallbladder still present, yields 1 point.
- A total serum bilirubin level exceeding 1.8 mg/dL also accrues 1 point.
- Abnormal liver biochemical tests, excluding bilirubin, are worth 1 point.
- The presence of ascending cholangitis, a serious infection of the bile duct, adds a substantial 5 points.
- Clinical symptoms of gallstone pancreatitis contribute 1 point.

Each factor is evaluated as a yes or no question (true or false). If the condition is met (true), its corresponding points are added to the total score. The range of possible scores is from 0 to 15.

Interpretation of the total score is straightforward:

- A score of 0 indicates a low risk of common bile duct stones.
- Scores ranging from 1 to 4 suggest an intermediate risk.
- A score of 5 or higher indicates a high risk of common bile duct stones.

This scoring system helps healthcare professionals assess the likelihood of common bile duct stones using a simple, structured approach.

### Electrocardiographic criteria for detecting acute myocardial infarction in patients with left bundle branch block: a meta-analysis [^111mtigj]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Study Objective

Numerous investigators have evaluated the ECG algorithm described by Sgarbossa et al to predict acute myocardial infarction in the presence of left bundle branch block and have arrived at divergent conclusions. To clarify the utility of the Sgarbossa ECG algorithm, we perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of these trials.

Methods

A structured search was applied to MEDLINE and Scopus databases, beginning with the year that the algorithm was derived (1996). Two reviewers independently screened citations, assessed for method quality, and extracted data (individual study characteristics, screening performance, and interobserver agreement) with a standardized extraction tool. We assessed qualifying studies for heterogeneity and generated summary estimates for the sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative likelihood ratios with fixed-effect models.

Results

We identified 11 studies with 2,100 patients that met criteria for at least 1 component of the analysis. Ten studies with 1,614 patients reported a Sgarbossa ECG algorithm score of greater than or equal to 3. These yielded a summary sensitivity of 20% (95% confidence interval [CI] 18% to 23%), specificity of 98% (95% CI 97% to 99%), a positive likelihood ratio of 7.9 (95% CI 4.5 to 13.8), and a negative likelihood ratio of 0.8 (95% CI 0.8 to 0.9). The summary diagnostic odds ratio revealed homogeneity. Seven studies with 1,213 patients reported a Sgarbossa ECG algorithm score of greater than or equal to 2. These yielded sensitivities ranging from 20% to 79% and specificities ranging from 61% to 100%. Positive likelihood ratios ranged from 0.7 to 6.6 and negative likelihood ratios ranged from 0.2 to 1.1. The summary diagnostic odds ratio revealed heterogeneity. Intra- and interobserver agreement was substantial. Sensitivity analysis using the highest-quality studies yielded similar results.

Conclusion

A Sgarbossa ECG algorithm score of greater than or equal to 3, representing greater than or equal to 1 mm of concordant ST elevation or greater than or equal to 1 mm ST depression in leads V1 to V3, is useful for diagnosing acute myocardial infarction in patients who present with left bundle branch block on ECG. The scoring system demonstrates good to excellent overall interobserver variability. A score of 2, representing 5 mm or more of discordant ST deviation, demonstrated ineffective positive likelihood ratios. A Sgarbossa ECG algorithm score of 0 is not useful in excluding acute myocardial infarction.

For Conditional recommendations, the majority of individuals in this situation would want the suggested course of action, but many would not, and different choices will be appropriate for different patients; decision aids may be useful in helping individuals in making decisions consistent with their values and preferences, and clinicians should expect to spend more time with patients when working towards a decision.

### New electrocardiographic algorithm for the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction in patients with left bundle branch block [^112TJZoB]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

The BARCELONA algorithm also had good specificity and positive predictive value: only 9% of patients without AMI would have still been transferred for emergent reperfusion by using the new algorithm. This percentage is in agreement with the prevalence of false‐positive activation of the pPCI protocol in the general population, including patients without LBBB. 15 Moreover, the BARCELONA algorithm confirmed a 90% specificity in a large cohort of patients with LBBB without suspected acute coronary syndrome.

Of note, among patients with LBBB and AMI included in the present study, there was a wide range of culprit arteries, including all major coronary branches as well as the left main. Thus, the good performance of the new algorithm could apply to any AMI location. Finally, this new algorithm is simpler as compared with the Modified Sgarbossa Criteria and could be widely applied without determining a relevant delay in diagnosis and reperfusion.

### International small for gestational age advisory board consensus development conference statement: management of short children born small for gestational age, April 24-October 1, 2001 [^115w9zPf]. Pediatrics (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To provide pediatric endocrinologists, general pediatricians, neonatologists, and primary care physicians with recommendations for the management of short children born small for gestational age (SGA).

Methods

A 13-member independent panel of pediatric endocrinologists was convened to discuss relevant issues with respect to definition, diagnosis, and clinical management of short children born SGA. Panel members convened over a series of 3 meetings to thoroughly review, discuss, and come to consensus on the identification and treatment of short children who are born SGA.

Conclusions

SGA is defined as birth weight and/or length at least 2 standard deviations (SDs) below the mean for gestational age (≤ -2 SD). Accurate gestational dating and measurement of birth weight and length are crucial for identifying children who are born SGA. Comprehensive pregnancy, perinatal, and immediate postnatal data may help to confirm the diagnosis. Maternal, placental, and fetal causes of SGA should be sought, although the cause is often not clear. Most children who are SGA experience catch-up growth and achieve a height > 2 SD below the mean; this catch-up process is usually completed by the time they are 2 years of age. A child who is SGA and older than 3 years and has persistent short stature (ie, remaining at least 2 SD below the mean for chronologic age) is not likely to catch up and should be referred to a pediatrician who has expertise in endocrinology. Bone age is not a reliable predictor of height potential in children who are SGA. Nevertheless, a standard evaluation for short stature should be performed. A diagnosis of SGA does not exclude growth hormone (GH) deficiency, and GH assessment should be performed if there is clinical suspicion or biochemical evidence of GH deficiency. At baseline, insulin-like growth factor-I, insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3, fasting insulin, glucose, and lipid levels as well as blood pressure should be measured, and all aspects of SGA-not just stature-should be addressed with parents. The objectives of GH therapy in short children who are SGA are catch-up growth in early childhood, maintenance of normal growth in childhood, and achievement of normal adult height. GH therapy is effective and safe in short children who are born SGA and should be considered in those older than 2 to 3 years. There is long-term experience of improved growth using a dosage range from 0.24 to 0.48 mg/kg/wk. Higher GH doses (0.48 mg/kg/wk [0.2 IU/kg/d]) are more effective for the short term. Whether the higher GH dose is more efficacious than the lower dose in terms of adult height results is not yet known. Only adult height results of randomized dose-response studies will give a definite answer. Monitoring is necessary to ensure safety of medication. Children should be monitored for changes in glucose homeostasis, lipids, and blood pressure during therapy. The frequency and intensity of monitoring will vary depending on risk factors such as family history, obesity, and puberty.

### New electrocardiographic algorithm for the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction in patients with left bundle branch block [^113sHMYg]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Electrocardiographic Diagnosis of AMI in the Presence of LBBB

Our results show that concordant ST deviations are extremely specific for AMI. This was already known for concordant ST elevation ≥ 1 mm (0.1 mV) (Sgarbossa score 5) but had not been demonstrated for concordant ST depression ≥ 1 mm (0.1 mV) in any lead. As described in Table 1 in their manuscript, 4 Sgarbossa and colleagues analyzed the ST‐segment concordance or discordance with QRS polarity only for ST elevation. By contrast, they evaluated the presence of ST depression in any lead without correlating it with QRS polarity. They found that ST depression in leads V1 to V3 was suggestive of AMI, since leads V1 to V3 generally display a negative QRS in patients with LBBB. However, such analysis without correlating ST depression with QRS polarity could miss the clinical relevance of concordant ST deviations occurring in those ECG leads that can have either a negative or a positive QRS in different patients with LBBB. In our series, when concordant ST depression was present, it occurred in leads other than V1 to V3 in the vast majority of patients with AMI, and these patients would have been missed by the Sgarbossa rules. Thus, we confirmed the hypothesis that by evaluating concordant ST depression in any lead, we could improve the sensitivity of the ECG to detect ischemia in different myocardial regions.

In patients with LBBB, it has been demonstrated that acute ischemia is associated with an increase in the magnitude of ST deviations discordant with QRS polarity 7, 13 so that they become disproportionately greater than would be expected by the voltage of the QRS in the corresponding lead. By using a new approach, we could identify a max (R|S) voltage of 6 mm (0.6 mV) as the best cutoff for disproportionate discordant ST deviations ≥ 1 mm (0.1 mV) suggestive of AMI.

The BARCELONA algorithm incorporated a comprehensive approach to repolarization abnormalities in patients with LBBB by including concordant ST deviations ≥ 1 mm (0.1 mV) in any lead and discordant ST deviations in leads with max (R|S) voltage ≤ 6 mm (0.6 mV). This algorithm significantly improved the sensitivity of the ECG to diagnose AMI in patients with LBBB, achieving similar results to those obtained by the ECG in patients without LBBB. 14 It also had a high negative predictive value: When the algorithm is negative, the probability of AMI seems very low.

Acute coronary occlusion — posterior MI and LBBB context: Emergent coronary angiography should be performed when there is a high suspicion for acute posterior MI; the presence of a new LBBB is no longer considered a STEMI equivalent; the Sgarbossa criteria are specific, although not sensitive; a modification using an ST/T-wave ratio improved sensitivity from 52% to 91% with similar specificity; for those meeting the Sgarbossa or modified Sgarbossa criteria, treatment should be similar to those with STEMI; and emergent echocardiography can be performed when there is an LBBB and suspicion for ischemia/infarction.

### Adverse perinatal outcomes after roux-en-Y gastric bypass vs. sleeve gastrectomy: a systematic review [^112VUcjx]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2023). Medium credibility.

As mentioned, deviations from the study protocol were also made and an early detection of the very small sample with due to strict surgery to conception interval led to a collective decision to change this exclusion criteria from a maximum of 3 years to a mean smaller than 4 years by the study group. This was decided early on, and no articles were excluded by the 3-year interval criteria before the deviation from the protocol.

There were several aberrations in type of values reported in the different studies. Kjaer et al. did not report a SD or CI for maternal BMI at conception and then used median instead of mean values. The study also reported some outcomes for RYGB and some for RYGB and Gastric banding, resulting in data that could not be added to the current review. Some articles did not report on all outcomes described in the introduction and method. For example, Karadag et al. did not report birthweight even though they reported SGA and LGA which requires birthweight to be calculated.

Systematic reviews are meant to develop and improve patient care and can form the basis for clinical practice. Our goal with this review was to identify which type of bariatric was associated with the least adverse perinatal outcomes. This would have enabled clinicians to provide the best potential care for their patients and give the patients the opportunity to be involved in their course of treatment for the best possible perinatal outcome.

### Customized vs INTERGROWTH-21standards for the assessment of birthweight and stillbirth risk at term [^113fktTw]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Fetal growth abnormalities are linked to stillbirth and other adverse pregnancy outcomes, and use of the correct birthweight standard is essential for accurate assessment of growth status and perinatal risk.

Objective

Two competing, conceptually opposite birthweight standards are currently being implemented internationally: customized gestation-related optimal weight (GROW) and INTERGROWTH-21 st. We wanted to compare their performance when applied to a multiethnic international cohort, and evaluate their usefulness in the assessment of stillbirth risk at term.

Study Design

We analyzed routinely collected maternity data from 10 countries with a total of 1.25 million term pregnancies in their respective main ethnic groups. The 2 standards were applied to determine small for gestational age (SGA) and large for gestational age (LGA) rates, with associated relative risk and population-attributable risk of stillbirth. The customized standard (GROW) was based on the term optimal weight adjusted for maternal height, weight, parity, and ethnic origin, while INTERGROWTH-21 st was a fixed standard derived from a multiethnic cohort of low-risk pregnancies.

Results

The customized standard showed an average SGA rate of 10.5% (range 10.1–12.7) and LGA rate of 9.5% (range 7.3–9.9) for the set of cohorts. In contrast, there was a wide variation in SGA and LGA rates with INTERGROWTH-21 st, with an average SGA rate of 4.4% (range 3.1–16.8) and LGA rate of 20.6% (range 5.1–27.5). This variation in INTERGROWTH-21 st SGA and LGA rates was correlated closely (R = ± 0.98) to the birthweights predicted for the 10 country cohorts by the customized method to derive term optimal weight, suggesting that they were mostly due to physiological variation in birthweight. Of the 10.5% of cases defined as SGA according to the customized standard, 4.3% were also SGA by INTERGROWTH-21 st and had a relative risk of 3.5 (95% confidence interval, 3.1–4.1) for stillbirth. A further 6.3% (60% of the whole customized SGA) were not SGA by INTERGROWTH-21 st, and had a relative risk of 1.9 (95% confidence interval, 3.1–4.1) for stillbirth. An additional 0.2% of cases were SGA by INTERGROWTH-21 st only, and had no increased risk of stillbirth. At the other end, customized assessment classified 9.5% of births as large for gestational age, most of which (9.0%) were also LGA by the INTERGROWTH-21 st standard. INTERGROWTH-21 st identified a further 11.6% as LGA, which, however, had a reduced risk of stillbirth (relative risk, 0.6; 95% confidence interval, 0.5–0.7).

Conclusion

Customized assessment resulted in increased identification of small for gestational age and stillbirth risk, while the wide variation in SGA rates using the INTERGROWTH-21 st standard appeared to mostly reflect differences in physiological pregnancy characteristics in the 10 maternity populations.

### New electrocardiographic algorithm for the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction in patients with left bundle branch block [^112zxvhN]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

The electrocardiographic diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in patients with left bundle branch block (LBBB) is often challenging. On one hand, most of patients referred for primary percutaneous coronary intervention (pPCI) because of the presence of LBBB are not experiencing an AMI. 1 On the other hand, patients with LBBB and AMI are usually at high risk and often experience delays in reperfusion therapy 1 that may lead to critical consequences. 2, 3

Unfortunately, even the most recent electrocardiographic algorithms 4, 5 do not afford a diagnostic certainty for AMI in patients with LBBB. 2, 5, 6 In the absence of acute ischemia, the LBBB pattern is characterized by (1) ST‐segment displacement in the opposite direction to the polarity of the QRS complex (further referred as discordant ST deviation) and (2) the existence of a certain degree of proportionality between the magnitude of the discordant ST deviation and the voltage of the corresponding QRS complex. 4, 5, 7 Thus, in addition to the clinical symptoms of acute ischemia, the occurrence of ST elevation concordant with QRS polarity (5 points in Sgarbossa rules, referred to as concordant ST elevation) and the presence of excessive discordant ST deviation (such as the ST/QRS ratio in the Modified Sgarbossa Criteria) 5 are specific for AMI. However, these criteria have a relatively low sensitivity. 2, 5, 6

Definition of SGA and Intrauterine Growth Retardation

SGA describes neonates born with a birth weight and/or length below the normal range for gestational age. Although the terms intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) and SGA are often used as synonyms, they are not interchangeable. IUGR refers to inappropriate gain in estimated fetal weight and abdominal circumference during a certain period of gestation based on 2 ultrasound measurements, irrespective of the size at birth. Most but not all infants with IUGR may be born SGA, depending on timing and severity of the intrauterine insult. Conversely, many SGA infants will have not experienced IUGR. IUGR tends to cause a relatively large head and length relative to birth weight.

The definition of SGA requires knowledge of gestational age, precise anthropometric measurements at birth, and appropriate reference data for birth weight and birth length. Country- or ethnic-specific normative data are important for identifying those at risk. The most commonly used reference data on birth size are derived from charts developed by Usher and McLean or Niklasson, which have been used in large studies on SGA. Alternatively, the Intergrowth-21 birth weight and length standards can be used to identify SGA. We recommend the use of national growth charts, when available, or the careful selection of the most appropriate for the region and ethnic-specific population. Neonates can be subclassified into SGA for weight, SGA for length, or SGA for both weight and length. Neonates born SGA with a small head circumference should be identified, as this may point to specific etiologies. These subclassifications may help in understanding the mechanisms and implications of being born SGA.

In the previous consensus statement published in 2007, SGA was uniformly defined as a birth weight and/or length below −2.0 standard deviation scores (SDS) for gestational age. Although this definition is arbitrary, knowing that the long-term consequences of being born SGA are likely graded rather than binary, we recommend keeping the same definition of SGA as being born with birth weight and/or length below −2 SDS for gestational age according to national reference standards, since this definition identifies children at high risk of short adult stature.

Recommendation: 1.000000000000000e+00 For accurate classification of SGA, we recommend the use of national growth charts, when available, or the careful selection of the most appropriate ones for the region- and ethnic-specific population. (A +++)

### Comparison of the QRS complex, ST-Segment, and T-Wave among patients with left bundle branch block with and without acute myocardial infarction [^111DtG9q]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The modified Sgarbossa criteria have been validated as a rule for diagnosis of acute coronary occlusion (ACO) in left bundle branch block (LBBB). However, no analysis has been done on differences in the QRS complex, T-wave, or ST-segment concordance of < 1 mm in the derivation or validation studies. Furthermore, there was no comparison of patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) but without ACO (i.e., non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction [non-STEMI]) to patients with ACO or without AMI (no MI).

Objective

We compare findings involving the QRS amplitude, ST-segment morphology, ST-concordance < 1 mm, and T-waves in patients with LBBB with ACO, non-STEMI, and no MI.

Methods

Retrospectively, emergency department patients were identified with LBBB and ischemic symptoms but no MI, with angiographically proven ACO, and with non-STEMI.

Results

ACO, non-STEMI, and no MI groups consisted of 33, 24, and 105 patients. The sum of the maximum deflection of the QRS amplitude across all leads (ΣQRS) was smaller in patients with ACO than those without ACO (101.5 mm vs. 132.5 mm; p < 0.0001) and a cutoff of ΣQRS < 90 mm was 92% specific. For ACO, non-concave ST-segment morphology was 91% specific, any ST concordance ≥ 1 mm was 95% specific, and any ST concordance ≥ 0.5 mm was 94% sensitive. For non-STEMI, terminal T-wave concordance, analogous to biphasic T-waves, was moderately sensitive at 79%.

Conclusions

We found differences in QRS amplitude, ST-segment morphology, and T-waves between patients with LBBB and ACO, non-STEMI, and no MI. However, none of these criteria outperformed the modified Sgarbossa criteria for diagnosis of ACO in LBBB.

Furthermore, we as well as others, 160, 208 believe that the decision on which chart to use can be further based on a comparison of performance of the various charts in the population of interest, using a local data set. This can be achieved by the following approaches: (1) statistical validation: finding the chart that matches best the distribution of fetal weight in low‐risk pregnancies in the local population. That is, identifying the chart that when applied to the local population yields weight percentiles that follow a normal distribution centered at approximately the 50th percentile, and identifies approximately 10% of the low‐risk population as being below the 10th percentile and above the 90th percentile, and approximately 5% of the population as being below the 5th percentile and above the 95th percentile. An example of this approach is provided in Figure 3; (2) outcome‐based validation: finding the chart for which the diagnosis of SGA has the best predictive value for adverse outcomes related to FGR. 211, 221 While this approach seems compelling, interpretation of the predictive value of the different charts for adverse outcomes may be challenging, as there is a trade‐off between detection rate and false positive rate for adverse outcomes. 221 Thus, charts that are shifted upward (e.g. Hadlock, WHO) would have a higher detection rate but also a high false‐positive rate, while charts that are shifted downward (e.g. Intergrowth‐21st) would have a lower false‐positive rate but would also have a lower detection rate for SGA fetuses at risk of adverse outcomes (Figure 4). Finding the chart that provides the best balance between these two measures requires careful consideration and should be based on a clear definition of the goals of screening.

### Morbidity and mortality in small-for-gestational-age infants: a secondary analysis of nine MFMU network studies [^111L2YBt]. American Journal of Perinatology (2017). Low credibility.

Objective To compare the neonatal morbidity and mortality among small-for-gestational-age (SGA; birth weight < 10% for estimated gestational age [EGA]) versus appropriate-for-gestational-age (AGA; birth weight at 10–89%) newborns. Methods Data from nine Maternal-Fetal Medicine Units Network studies were used and included nonanomalous singletons at 24 weeks or more and birth weight < 90% for EGA. Using multivariable analysis, we compared the morbidity and mortality between SGA and AGA. Random-effect logistic regressions were utilized with adjustment for 10 variables. Results Among the nine studies 71,744 singletons met the inclusion criteria, with 13% (n = 9,415) SGA and 87% (n = 62,329) AGA. Among SGA, the likelihood of stillbirth (8.8 vs. 2.5 per 1,000 births; adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 3.98, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.92–5.42) and neonatal mortality (14.0 vs. 5.5 per 1,000 births; aOR 3.18, 95% CI: 2.55–3.95) was threefold higher compared with AGA. For the subgroup of newborns of EGA of 32 weeks or more, SGA, compared with AGA, had significantly higher risk of stillbirth (aOR 3.32, 95% CI: 2.16–5.12) and neonatal mortality (aOR 2.50; 95% CI: 1.38–4.54). From 35 weeks onward, the risk of stillbirth among SGA is almost four times higher than for AGA. Conclusion The risk of stillbirth and neonatal mortality is significantly higher with SGA than with AGA. Modification in practice or new management schema may be warranted.

### Latin American consensus: children born small for gestational age [^112iwNrR]. BMC Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

Discussion

Definition of SGA

The definition of SGA is unclear. The World Health Organization (WHO) defines children born SGA or after intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) as those with birth weight below the 10th percentile of the recommended gender-specific birth weight for referenced gestational age. Where gestational age is not available, the birth weight of < 2500 g should be considered low birth weight. This definition is also used in obstetrics and neonatal guidelines due to the fact that these children represent groups with the highest neonatal morbidity and mortality. However, neonates with either low birth weight or length — or both — for gestational age should be considered SGA.

For the purpose of this consensus, an SGA child is a child whose birth weight and/or birth length is at least 2 standard deviations (SD) below the mean for its gestational age.

Notably, we recommend that the term SGA not be used as a synonym for IUGR. The term IUGR refers to insufficient growth of the fetus and should only be used if at least 2 assessments of intrauterine growth are available and the fetus is not growing appropriately. SGA refers to body size — a low weight and/or length for a known gestational age — and is preferred in the absence of information about fetal growth.

### Validation of the modified sgarbossa criteria for acute coronary occlusion in the setting of left bundle branch block: a retrospective case-control study [^112q8PjH]. American Heart Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The modified Sgarbossa criteria were proposed in a derivation study to be superior to the original criteria for diagnosing acute coronary occlusion (ACO) in left bundle branch block (LBBB). The new rule replaces the third criterion (5 mm of excessively discordant ST elevation [STE]) with a proportion (at least 1 mm STE and STE/S wave ≤ -0.25). We sought to validate the modified criteria.

Methods

This retrospective case-control study was performed by chart review in 2 tertiary care center emergency departments (EDs) and 1 regional referral center. A billing database was used at 1 site to identify all ED patients with LBBB and ischemic symptoms between May 2009 and June 2012. In addition, all 3 sites identified LBBB ACO patients who underwent emergent catheterization. We measured QRS amplitude and J-point deviation in all leads, blinded to outcomes. Acute coronary occlusion was determined by angiographic findings and cardiac biomarker levels, which were collected blinded to electrocardiograms. Diagnostic statistics of each rule were calculated and compared using McNemar's test.

Results

Our consecutive cohort search identified 258 patients: 9 had ACO, and 249 were controls. Among the 3 sites, an additional 36 cases of ACO were identified, for a total of 45 ACO cases and 249 controls. The modified criteria were significantly more sensitive than the original weighted criteria (80% vs 49%, P < .001) and unweighted criteria (80% vs 56%, P < .001). Specificity of the modified criteria was not statistically different from the original weighted criteria (99% vs 100%, P = 0.5) but was significantly greater than the original unweighted criteria (99% vs 94%, P = 0.004).

Conclusions

The modified Sgarbossa criteria were superior to the original criteria for identifying ACO in LBBB.

### Electrocardiographic diagnosis of myocardial infarction in patients with left bundle branch block [^113CU2YY]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2000). Low credibility.

Study Objective

To validate ECG criteria previously proposed by Sgarbossa et al for the detection of myocardial infarction (MI) in patients with left bundle branch block (LBBB) and suspected ischemia.

Methods

A retrospective cohort study was performed at an urban teaching hospital. All patients admitted with suspected ischemia and LBBB were eligible. MI was defined as an elevated creatine kinase (CK) isoenzyme MB (> 14 IU/L) that was at least 5% of total CK level. ECGs were interpreted by 2 physicians blinded to patient outcome. Interpreters were asked to rate ECGs for the presence of each of the 3 criteria proposed by Sgarbossa et al: (1) ST-segment elevation greater than or equal to 1 mm concordant with the QRS complex; (2) ST-segment elevation greater than or equal to 5 mm discordant with the QRS complex; and (3) ST-segment depression in leads V₁ through V₃. Interobserver agreement was assessed.

Results

Of 190 eligible patients, 25 (13%) had MI. Sensitivities of the 3 criteria varied from 0 to 16%, with specificities of 93% to 100%. Only the first criterion demonstrated a clinically useful likelihood ratio (positive likelihood ratio = 16 [95% confidence interval 4 to > 100]). Patients with new LBBB were more likely to have MI (relative risk = 5. 1 [95% confidence interval 2.6 to 10]). Interobserver agreement among ECG interpreters ranged from 93% to 98%.

Conclusion

The criteria of Sgarbossa et al cannot be used to exclude MI in patients with LBBB because of low sensitivities and poor negative likelihood ratios. ST-segment elevation concordant with the QRS complex had a high positive likelihood ratio for identification of MI. Patients with new LBBB and suspected ischemia are 5 times more likely to have MI than patients with LBBB of chronic or unknown duration.

8.2.2 Gestational age‐related management strategy

The balance between fetal and neonatal risks defines the predominant management strategy at different gestational epochs. Accordingly, the goal of management shifts from gaining fetal viability at 26 weeks to a graded improvement in survival, neonatal morbidity, and neurodevelopment by delaying delivery until 34–36 weeks. The increase in stillbirth rate in undelivered fetuses increasingly favors delivery from 36 weeks onward.

Timing of delivery in FGR has been evaluated in three randomized trials. The growth restriction intervention trial (GRIT) randomized pregnancies that had abnormal fetal biometry and umbilical artery Doppler studies performed as part of clinical management into immediate delivery after completion of a course of steroids versus delivery when the managing physician was no longer comfortable with conservative management. 294, 295 The monitoring protocol and delivery criteria were not specified. The trial demonstrated that, in the absence of specific criteria, either management approach resulted in the same perinatal outcome. Delaying delivery increased the risk of stillbirth, while earlier delivery resulted in a higher degree of prematurity‐related complications that either led to neonatal death or an increased risk of developmental delay.

The disproportionate intrauterine growth intervention trial at term (DIGITAT) randomized SGA fetuses by several biometry criteria, independent of the umbilical artery Doppler pattern, to induction or expectant monitoring between 36 and 41 weeks of gestation. 347 The study demonstrated that, while elective induction did not affect neonatal or obstetric outcomes, deliveries prior to 38 weeks resulted in a higher rate of admissions to the neonatal intensive care unit.

These trials demonstrate that the relative risk for neonatal complications requires definitive delivery indications until 38 weeks of gestation. After that time, delivery for indication of FGR is likely to prevent stillbirth in ongoing pregnancies. The continuous decrease in neonatal risks requires that delivery indications at early gestational ages occur at a higher threshold for fetal risks than after 30–32 weeks.

### Infants eligible for neonatal hypoglycemia screening: a systematic review [^113tvAWX]. JAMA Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

Importance

Neonatal hypoglycemia is common, occurring in up to 50% of infants at risk for hypoglycemia (infant of diabetic mother [IDM], small for gestational age [SGA], large for gestational age [LGA], and preterm) and is associated with long-term neurodevelopmental impairment. Guidelines recommend screening infants at risk of hypoglycemia. The proportion of infants who require screening for neonatal hypoglycemia is unknown.

Objective

To determine the proportion of infants eligible for neonatal hypoglycemia screening using criteria from the highest-scoring critically appraised clinical guideline.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This systematic review of the literature was conducted to identify clinical practice guidelines for neonatal hypoglycemia and took place at a tertiary maternity hospital in Auckland, New Zealand. Eligible guidelines were critically appraised using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation II tool. Using screening criteria extracted from the highest-scoring guideline, the proportion of infants eligible for neonatal hypoglycemia screening was determined in a retrospective observational cohort study of infants born January 1, 2004, to December 31, 2018. Data were analyzed by logistic regression. Infant participants were included if gestational age was 35 weeks or more, birth weight was 2000 g or more, and they were not admitted to a neonatal intensive care unit less than 1 hour after birth. The data were analyzed from November 2022 through February 2023. A total of 101 372 infants met the inclusion criteria.

Exposure

Risk factors for neonatal hypoglycemia.

Main Outcome

Proportion of infants eligible for neonatal hypoglycemia screening.

Results

The study team screened 2366 abstracts and 18 guidelines met inclusion criteria for appraisal. There was variability in the assessed quality of guidelines and a lack of consensus between screening criteria. The highest-scoring guideline defined screening criteria as: IDM, preterm (less than 37 weeks' gestation), SGA (less than 10th percentile), birth weight of less than 2500 g or more than 4500 g, LGA (more than 90th percentile), or gestational age more than 42 weeks. A total of 101 372 infants met criteria for inclusion in the cohort study; median (IQR) gestational age was 39 (38–40) weeks and 51% were male. The overall proportion of infants eligible for screening was 26.3%. There was an increase in the proportion of eligible infants from 25.6% to 28.5% over 15 years, which was not statistically significant after adjustment for maternal age, body mass index, ethnicity, and multiple pregnancy (odds ratio, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.93–1.03; change in proportion per year).

Conclusion

A systematic review found that practice guidelines providing recommendations for clinical care of neonatal hypoglycemia were of variable quality with is a lack of consensus regarding definitions for infants at risk for hypoglycemia. In the cohort study, one-quarter of infants were eligible for hypoglycemia screening. Further research is required to identify which infants may benefit from neonatal hypoglycemia screening.

### Rapid diagnosis of STEMI equivalent in patients with left bundle-branch block: is It feasible? [^1143skFC]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Several ECG scores have been suggested for rapid identification of patients with LBBB and STEMI equivalent. The first score was described by Sgarbossa et al, suggesting that concordant ST‐segment elevation of ≥ 1 mm in ≥ 1 lead or concordant ST‐segment depression of ≥ 1 mm in leads V1‐V3 is a sign of "transmural" ischemia owing to AMI. Originally tested for identifying AMI (elevated creatine kinase‐MB levels), this score has low sensitivity for detecting OMI (adjudicated by coronary angiography). In the original article they described a third criterion (excessively discordant ST elevation, defined as ≥ 5 mm in leads with negative QRS complexes). This criterion was found to be less predictive and later was modified by Smith et al to adjust the absolute magnitude of the ST elevation to the size of the QRS complex (≥ 1 mm ST elevation with an ST elevation to S‐wave amplitude ratio ≥ 0.25). The reported sensitivity of the modified criteria is higher than that of the original Sgarbossa criteria. More recently, a new modification called the Barcelona criteria, was derived, but not validated, in a large cohort of patients referred for primary percutaneous coronary intervention (n = 484); however, the outcome criteria for OMI included patients with Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction‐3 flow and peak troponins only 10x the upper reference limit, which includes troponin values that are seen in almost all NSTEMI patients and thus would include almost all non‐OMI. The Barcelona algorithm includes ST deviation > 1 mm concordant with QRS polarity in any ECG lead or ST deviation > 1 mm discordant with QRS polarity; in any lead with maximal QRS (R or S wave) voltage < 6 mm is considered predictive of STEMI equivalent. This algorithm was tested in a relatively large cohort of patients referred for primary percutaneous coronary intervention (n = 484) and reported better accuracy than the Sgarbossa and Smith criteria. Yet, it has not been validated in an independent cohort. The study included selected patients who were referred for primary percutaneous coronary intervention, rather than patients who presented with symptoms compatible with ACS to the emergency medical service ambulances or emergency department. The control group included patients with LBBB without clinical suspicion of ACS.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2013). Medium credibility.

Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator and cardiac resynchronization therapy appropriate use criteria — relationship to guidelines and scope — state that appropriate use criteria "should be considered in concert with the guidelines", and where overlap exists "the ratings are consistent with the guideline recommendations". Generally, scenarios deemed Appropriate or May Be Appropriate "often meet Class I, IIa, or IIb" guideline categories or are otherwise supported. The document highlights that comorbidities can modify decisions — showing how other medical issues "may modify the decision to implant an otherwise indicated or appropriate ICD" — and that described scenarios "should be used as a guide to work in accompaniment with other clinical information". Users are advised to understand these criteria as a "guide", not a list of "do" or "do not do" specifications, and to recognize that not all situations are covered and "should be considered in their unique contexts". It also notes the criteria "may be applied in many ways", including development of decision support or educational tools.

### Diagnosis of ST-elevation myocardial infarction in the presence of left bundle branch block with the ST-elevation to S-wave ratio in a modified sgarbossa rule [^111RxXRt]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "Sgarbossa's criteria for MI in left bundle branch block" for ST-elevation myocardial infarction, left bundle branch block and non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction.

Sgarbossa's criteria for myocardial infarction (MI) in left bundle branch block is a diagnostic tool designed to identify patients with acute MI in the presence of a left bundle branch block, a condition that often obscures the electrocardiographic diagnosis of MI. The criteria incorporate three primary components: ST-segment elevation of 1 mm or more that is concordant with the QRS complex, ST-segment depression of 1 mm or more in lead V1, V2, or V3, and excessively discordant ST elevation or depression in any one lead. These components are used to evaluate the likelihood of an acute MI, providing valuable information for clinical decision-making in patients with left bundle branch block.

The calculator evaluates the likelihood of myocardial infarction (MI) in patients with a left bundle branch block by analyzing three specific ECG criteria. Here's how the scoring system works:

- If there is ST-segment elevation of at least 1 mm that occurs in the same direction as the QRS complex, this contributes 5 points to the total score.
- An ST-segment depression of 1 mm or more in ECG leads V1, V2, or V3 adds 3 points.
- If there is any excessively discordant ST elevation or depression in any one lead, 2 points are added.

For each criterion that is true, the corresponding points are summed to obtain an overall score. For example, if a patient exhibits both an ST-segment elevation concordant with the QRS complex and excessively discordant ST changes, the total score would be 7, calculated as 5 points for the first criterion plus 2 points for the third one. Should none of the criteria be met, the resulting score would be 0.

The interpretation of the total score helps guide clinical decision-making regarding myocardial infarction:

- A score of less than 3 suggests that a myocardial infarction is unlikely to have occurred.
- A score of 3 or higher indicates that a myocardial infarction is likely.

The calculator outputs a total score ranging from 0 to 10, accompanied by an interpretation to help evaluate the probability of myocardial infarction based on these thresholds.

### Interobserver agreement in the electrocardiographic diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction in patients with left bundle branch block [^112Umcds]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2000). Low credibility.

Study Objective

To determine the interobserver agreement between cardiologists and emergency physicians in the ECG diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in patients with left bundle branch block (LBBB) using the ECG algorithm previously described by Sgarbossa et al.

Methods

Using the Sgarbossa ECG algorithm, 4 cardiologists and 4 emergency physicians independently interpreted a test set of 224 ECGs with LBBB, of which 100 ECGs were from patients with an evolving AMI. A subset of 25 ECGs was reinterpreted by each reader to test intraobserver agreement for AMI as well as interobserver agreement for the degree of ST-segment deviation. Agreement rates for AMI were estimated using the kappa statistic. In addition, the sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing AMI were determined for each reader, using the Global Utilization of Streptokinase and Tissue Plasminogen Activator for Occluded Coronary Arteries (GUSTO I) enzyme criteria for AMI as the gold standard. The study was conducted at 3 university-affiliated medical centers. The test set contained ECGs from 100 patients enrolled in the GUSTO I trial with LBBB on their initial ECG and an evolving AMI confirmed by serum cardiac enzyme changes, and 124 control patients from the Duke Databank for Cardiovascular Disease who had stable, angiographically documented coronary artery disease and LBBB.

Results

There was excellent interobserver agreement (kappa = 0.81, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.80 to 0.83) between cardiologists and emergency physicians for diagnosing AMI. Intraobserver agreement kappa values for AMI diagnosis by cardiologists and emergency physicians were 0.81 (95% CI 0.67 to 0.94) and 0.71 (95% CI 0.54 to 0.89). The median sensitivity for diagnosing AMI by cardiologists and emergency physicians was 73% (range 66% to 80%) versus 67% (range 61% to 75%); median specificity was 98% (range 97% to 99%) versus 99% (range 98% to 99%). Spearman rank correlation coefficients for the degree of ST-segment deviation in all 12 leads was 0.86 (95% CI 0.85 to 0.87) among all readers.

Conclusion

There is excellent interobserver agreement between cardiologists and emergency physicians for diagnosing AMI when applying the Sgarbossa ECG algorithm to patients with LBBB. Emergency physicians should be able to reliably use this algorithm when evaluating patients.

### Modified Duke / European Society of Cardiology 2015 clinical criteria for infective endocarditis: time for an update? [^112kpiyP]. Open Heart (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The clinical diagnosis of infective endocarditis (IE), despite advances in both imaging technologies and techniques of culturing organisms, remains challenging. Current clinical diagnosis of IE is based on the modified Duke/European Society of Cardiology (ESC) 2015 clinical criteria for the diagnosis of IE, with the presence of typical imaging features of IE and the identification of a causative organism (predominantly from blood cultures) the two major components of the criteria. In the absence of both major criteria being present, either one major criterion with three or more of the minor criteria or no major criteria with all five minor criteria would classify patients as definite IE.

The gold standard for the diagnosis of IE remains histopathological examination revealing active endocarditis or the presence of microorganisms within either a vegetation or valve tissue. The Duke criteria, with a reported sensitivity of 70%–80%, misclassify a number of patients with confirmed IE by pathological criteria, as possible IE. This is driven primarily by a lower sensitivity in patients with blood culture negative IE (BCNIE), prosthetic valve endocarditis (PVE) and device-related endocarditis (DRE). Modifications were made to the original Duke criteria to increase the sensitivity of the clinical criteria in these groups of patients. The modified Duke criteria elevated positive serology for Coxiella burnetii to a major microbiological criteria and expanded the major imaging criteria to include transoesophageal echocardiography (TEE). Coxiella burnetii, an obligate intracellular bacterium that cannot be cultured on synthetic culture media, is the the most common cause of BCNIE in European cohorts and its serological addition to the modified Duke criteria has increased the sensitivity of the criteria in these cohorts. Subsequent to the modified Duke criteria, the modified Duke/ESC 2015 clinical criteria were introduced; this expanded the major imaging criteria to include typical imaging features by cardiac computerized tomography (CT) with or without 18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (18 FDG-PET). This expansion of the major imaging criteria were specifically introduced to increase the sensitivity of the criteria in patients with PVE or DRE. The minor criteria have remained mostly unchanged since the introduction of the Duke criteria, although many of the clinical features retained in the minor criteria are rarely encountered in patients with IE today.

### Rapid diagnosis of STEMI equivalent in patients with left bundle-branch block: is It feasible? [^113Voswm]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Many patients presenting with LBBB have underlying cardiomyopathies (ischemic or nonischemic). Many may present with symptoms compatible with ACS (shortness of breath, pulmonary edema, hypotension) and could have elevation in cardiac troponin levels. Yet, many could have type‐2 AMIs because of supply‐demand mismatch or even nonischemic myocardial injury. A large number of patients with advanced cardiomyopathy have small amplitude QRS and therefore there is a concern that using the Barcelona algorithm, overdiagnosis of STEMI equivalent could be frequent if applied to patients with LBBB presenting with acute heart failure exacerbation. On the other hand, using the Smith modification allows for exclusion of patients with LBBB and left ventricular hypertrophy who have an absolute magnitude of discordant ST segment deviation in leads with large amplitude QRS complexes.

A major issue of the previously mentioned studies, including a study by Nestelberger et al, is the definition of the end point. As mentioned, Sgarbossa et al tested their ECG criteria for identifying patients with creatine kinase MB elevation (not limited to STEMI equivalent), whereas the Barcelona algorithm was tested against relatively lower magnitude of cardiac troponin elevation, which would include virtually all patients with AMI, not just those with OMI. The same holds for the Nestelberger study. In contrast, Smith et al used a much higher threshold of cardiac troponin elevation that probably restricted the "positive" to patients with true STEMI equivalence.

In cases of early‐onset FGR the main goal is to prolong pregnancy and maximize fetal maturation by means of expectant management under close monitoring until there is evidence of late Doppler changes in the umbilical artery (AEDV or REDV), ductus venosus alterations, or FHR abnormalities. Therefore, at the point when delivery is indicated in cases of severe early‐onset FGR, the fetus might already be experiencing some degree of hypoxia or acidosis, 291 in which case the likelihood of the fetus tolerating labor is low and the rate of cesarean section has been reported to be greater than 80%. 351 In addition, labor induction in general is less likely to be successful during the preterm period. 352, 353 For these reasons, primary cesarean section is usually the preferred option when delivery is indicated in cases of severe early‐onset FGR. 354

In contrast, late‐onset FGR is usually less severe and fetal hypoxia or acidosis are less likely to be present at the time when delivery is indicated. Indeed, in the DIGITAT trial the rate of vaginal delivery was greater than 80% in pregnancies induced for SGA with normal umbilical artery Doppler after 36 weeks of gestation. 347 This observation suggests that most term SGA fetuses with normal umbilical artery Doppler can tolerate labor and that the presence of late‐onset FGR in the absence of additional factors does not preclude induction of labor. Several studies have tried to individualize the decision regarding mode of delivery through the development of models for the prediction of urgent cesarean section in women with late‐onset SGA undergoing labor induction. The factors that were most predictive of urgent cesarean section were gestational age, severity of SGA (EFW < 3rd percentile), cerebral Doppler (middle cerebral artery and cerebroplacental ratio), and Bishop score. 355, 356 For example, in a large cohort study of 509 women undergoing labor induction for late‐onset SGA, the predictive model had a positive predictive value of 36% and a negative predictive value of 89% for urgent cesarean section for nonreassuring fetal state. 355 Thus, although this information can be helpful for patient counselling regarding mode of delivery and may reassure women with none of these risk factors of the high likelihood of a successful trial of labor (nearly 90%), the positive predictive value of these models (i.e. a risk of cesarean section in the range of 30%–40%) is not high enough to preclude a trial of labor even when these risk factors are present.

### New ECG criteria for acute myocardial infarction in patients with left bundle branch block [^116gz4he]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Sensitivity and Specificity

All the measurements in this study were made manually. In their supplementary data, the authors give an example where approximation of a measurement could lead to a different interpretation of one of the modified Sgarbossa criteria, depending on whether approximation of ST depression was 0.15 or 0.2 mV. This is because the ratio |STj/Samp| was involved. In the new Barcelona criteria, no ratios are involved. However, a similar situation must arise where the amplitude of an R or S wave could be 0.62 mV when measured by computer but a manual estimate measuring to the nearest 0.05 mV could be 0.6 mV. In the latter case, this wave would meet one of the Barcelona thresholds, being ≤ 0.6 mV, whereas the automated measurement would not. Of course, it could be argued development of the criteria is based on manual measurements and therefore application would also apply to manual measurements but clearly there is scope for variation here, as in any manual versus automated ECG measurement.

The authors performed a separate assessment of specificity on 214 hospital patients without any evidence of an AMI and who had not undergone cardiac catheterization. Specificity of the Barcelona criteria remained high at 90%, although this was the lowest specificity of all criteria.

Perhaps one of the most surprising aspects of the new criteria is the fact that discordant ST depression in V6, for example, can be regarded as a positive indicator of myocardial infarction if the R‐wave amplitude is ≤ 0.6 mV. This criterion had a surprisingly high specificity of 94%, even when assessed together with concordant ST elevation.

For this reason, the author made a rapid review of 50 cases of LBBB selected at random from a local database of several hundred thousand ECGs recorded mainly in a hospital setting. Time did not permit analysis of a larger sample. However, it was found that 94% of examples had a maximum R or S wave ≤ 0.6 mV in ≥ 1 lead. There is therefore scope for checking the new Barcelona criterion of significant discordant ST deviation.

It should also be noted that in Fig. 2, the R amplitude in V5 is approximately 0.5 mV and the STj depression exceeds 0.1 mV and so the Barcelona algorithm is positive.

### From ST-segment elevation MI to occlusion MI: the new paradigm shift in acute myocardial infarction [^1112zhKJ]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

OMI paradigm shift

"The decision to reject one paradigm is always simultaneously the decision to accept another, and the judgment leading to that decision involves the comparison of both paradigms with nature and with each other".

The study of STEMI anomalies has given rise to the new OMI paradigm (Figure 4). The STEMI and OMI paradigms are now being directly compared with nature and with each other. The OMI timeline summarizes this growing body of literature.

Figure 4
Occlusion MI Paradigm

The OMI paradigm classifies MI by the presence or absence of occlusion in the patient. As with other paradigm shifts, this incorporates the previous paradigm (eg, STEMI(+)OMI) while providing evidence-based advances for STEMI(−)OMI that not only add to ECG interpretation but change the diagnostic focus from ECG to patient. Abbreviations as in Figures 1 and 3.

Aslanger published the DIFOCCULT (DIagnostic accuracy oF electrocardiogram for acute coronary OCClUsion resuLTing in myocardial infarction) trial, in which 28% of non-STEMI were reclassified as "OMI" by blinded ECG interpretation alone. These non-STEMI-OMI patients had much larger infarcts and higher 800-day mortality (10.6% vs 4.4%). Similarly, Meyersfound that emergency physicians trained in the OMI paradigm could identify OMI with twice the sensitivity and preserved specificity as STEMI criteria, and significantly earlier.

Citing the work of Meyers, the new American College of Cardiology expert consensus on acute chest pain warns that STEMI criteria "will miss a significant minority of patients with ACO" and that providers need to look for subtle "ECG signs of vessel occlusion" — like hyperacute T waves, subtle STE with reciprocal change, anterior depression from posterior OMI, and Smith-Modified Sgarbossa criteria. This is a crucial acknowledgment of the difference between the limited surrogate marker of STEMI criteria and the underlying pathology of OMI, and promotion of evidence-based ECG advances.
