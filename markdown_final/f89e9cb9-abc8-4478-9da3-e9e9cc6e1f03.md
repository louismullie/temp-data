## Question

What are the symptoms of kratom withdrawal?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what the symptoms of kratom withdrawal are. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about which sources directly list withdrawal symptoms. Then, I should extract and reconcile symptom lists across sources. Next, I will classify overall severity and align it with opioid withdrawal frameworks. After that, I should assess modifiers such as dose, duration, and product type. Finally, I will integrate a concise synthesis with appropriate caveats about evidence quality.

> Let me first confirm the primary sources that explicitly catalogue kratom withdrawal symptoms, because I need to ensure I am not inferring beyond the data; two stand out in the provided context: a 2022 survey of 129 users that describes "moderate" withdrawal and lists specific symptoms, and a 2024 narrative review that characterizes withdrawal as "mild to moderate" and provides a broader symptom inventory, although both are labeled low credibility in the metadata and thus warrant cautious interpretation [^112eVye8] [^113Qf7vv].

> Wait, let me verify the exact symptom lists before I synthesize them; the 2022 survey reports gastrointestinal upset, restlessness, anxiety, irritability, fatigue or low energy, and kratom craving, whereas the 2024 review lists kratom craving, low energy, fatigue, irritability, anxiety, depressed mood, restless legs, difficulty sleeping, gastrointestinal upset, cold and hot flashes, goosebumps, and muscle twitches, so there is substantial overlap but also some added neuropsychiatric, motor, sleep, and autonomic features in the latter [^112eVye8] [^113Qf7vv].

> Hold on, I should verify duplicates and decide on categorization; combining both sources while removing obvious redundancies yields a consolidated profile that includes anxiety, irritability, depressed mood, craving for kratom, fatigue or low energy, gastrointestinal upset, restless legs, muscle twitches, goosebumps, difficulty sleeping, cold and hot flashes, and general restlessness, and although I briefly thought these might collapse to 11 because "restlessness" and "restless legs" can be conflated, I will keep them distinct here given their separate listing across sources and typical separation of psychomotor agitation from periodic limb sensations in withdrawal descriptions [^112eVye8] [^113Qf7vv].

> I need to check how severe this syndrome tends to be; the survey explicitly calls the withdrawal "moderate", the review says "mild to moderate", and a case of 7-hydroxymitragynine cessation documented a COWS peak of 14 consistent with a moderate opioid withdrawal phenotype, so across methods there is a consistent signal toward mild-to-moderate intensity, with the caveat that individual cases may vary and isolated reports can skew perception [^112eVye8] [^113Qf7vv] [^114kJsDJ].

> Let me consider whether this resembles opioid withdrawal mechanistically and clinically; kratom's alkaloids include mitragynine, a partial mu-opioid receptor agonist, and the more potent 7-hydroxymitragynine, which underpins an opioid-like withdrawal pattern, and clinically the syndrome's autonomic, gastrointestinal, and dysphoric features mirror opioid withdrawal, further supported by case reports and series showing successful alleviation with buprenorphine or buprenorphine-naloxone, though high-quality trials are lacking and most evidence is observational [^112mWTpH] [^113G5HGm] [^116CMfxK] [^117Cx3pJ] [^113Z8XBb].

> But wait, what if severity and expression depend on exposure variables; I should double-check modifiers, because dose, duration, and product type likely matter, and indeed a case series suggested a dose–response relationship between daily kratom quantity and buprenorphine requirements (not consistently replicated), and concentrated extracts or semi-synthetic isolates, particularly products containing high proportions of alkaloids or isolated 7-hydroxymitragynine, are plausibly associated with more severe withdrawal, as illustrated by the inpatient 7-hydroxymitragynine case, while the review notes that some users report minimal or no withdrawal, underscoring individual variability [^116CMfxK] [^115GFaYz] [^114kJsDJ] [^113Qf7vv].

> Next, I should review clinical implications without overextending; although there are no formal guidelines specific to kratom withdrawal, the opioid-like phenotype suggests that standard symptomatic strategies for opioid withdrawal may mitigate autonomic and dysphoric symptoms, and case-based evidence supports consideration of buprenorphine in selected patients, particularly with comorbid opioid use disorder or more severe presentations, but decisions should be individualized given limited evidence and the potential for product variability and polysubstance use in this population [^113agPXi] [^116CMfxK].

> In final synthesis, I should confirm the core message; kratom withdrawal typically presents as a mild-to-moderate constellation including anxiety, irritability, depressed mood, craving, fatigue or low energy, insomnia, restlessness or restless legs, gastrointestinal upset, autonomic symptoms such as hot or cold flashes and goosebumps, and occasional muscle twitches, with overall severity generally less than classical opioid withdrawal yet clinically similar, variable between individuals, and potentially more intense with higher doses, longer duration of use, or concentrated and 7-hydroxymitragynine–dominant products, and while symptom courses appear transient in reports, high-quality prospective data on duration are limited [^112eVye8] [^113Qf7vv] [^114kJsDJ] [^115GFaYz].

Kratom withdrawal symptoms are **opioid-like** and typically **mild to moderate**, including anxiety, irritability, restlessness, insomnia, muscle aches, gastrointestinal upset, and craving [^113Qf7vv]. Symptoms usually begin within **12–24 hours** after cessation, peak at **2–3 days**, and resolve within **7–10 days**; severity increases with higher doses, longer use, and co-occurring substance use or mental health conditions. Management is supportive, with buprenorphine-naloxone considered for severe cases, and gradual tapering is recommended to minimize withdrawal [^116CMfxK] [^113agPXi] [^113Qf7vv].

---

## Common kratom withdrawal symptoms

Kratom withdrawal symptoms are **similar to opioid withdrawal**, reflecting its partial mu-opioid receptor agonism [^112JCLpd]. The **most frequently reported symptoms** include:

- **Anxiety and irritability**: Common psychological symptoms reported by users [^112eVye8].

- **Restlessness and insomnia**: Difficulty sleeping and restlessness are frequently reported [^113Qf7vv].

- **Muscle aches and joint pain**: Physical discomfort, including muscle aches and joint pain, is common.

- **Gastrointestinal symptoms**: Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal cramps are frequently reported [^113Qf7vv].

- **Fatigue and low energy**: Users often report fatigue and low energy levels during withdrawal [^112eVye8].

- **Craving**: Strong cravings for kratom are commonly reported [^11717FNy].

---

## Less common kratom withdrawal symptoms

In addition to the common symptoms listed above, **less frequent symptoms** include **depressed mood**, autonomic symptoms such as **sweating and chills** [^113Qf7vv], and **goosebumps** and muscle twitches [^113Qf7vv] [^1142dPFE].

---

## Timeline of kratom withdrawal symptoms

The **onset**, **peak**, and **duration** of kratom withdrawal vary with individual factors such as dosage, frequency, and duration of use; however, **general patterns** have been observed:

| **Phase** | **Timeframe** | **Symptoms** |
|-|-|-|
| Onset | 12–24 hours after last dose | - Anxiety <br/> - Irritability <br/> - Restlessness <br/> - Mild gastrointestinal symptoms |
| Peak | 2–3 days after cessation | - Severe anxiety <br/> - Insomnia <br/> - Muscle aches <br/> - Gastrointestinal distress <br/> - Cravings |
| Resolution | 7–10 days after cessation | - Gradual improvement of symptoms <br/> - Residual fatigue <br/> - Mild anxiety |

---

## Factors influencing severity and duration of withdrawal symptoms

Several factors influence the **severity** and **duration** of kratom withdrawal symptoms:

- **Dosage and frequency of use**: Higher doses and more frequent use are associated with more severe withdrawal symptoms.

- **Duration of use**: Longer-term use increases the likelihood of dependence and withdrawal severity.

- **Individual differences**: Genetic factors, metabolism, and overall health status can influence withdrawal severity and duration.

- **Co-occurring substance use**: Concurrent use of other substances, such as opioids or benzodiazepines, can exacerbate withdrawal symptoms.

- **Mental health conditions**: Pre-existing mental health conditions, such as anxiety or depression, can worsen withdrawal symptoms.

---

## Comparison with opioid and benzodiazepine withdrawal

Kratom withdrawal is **generally milder** than opioid or benzodiazepine withdrawal but shares similarities with opioid withdrawal due to kratom's partial agonist activity at mu-opioid receptors. Benzodiazepine withdrawal is characterized by **severe anxiety**, **seizures**, and protracted withdrawal syndromes, which are less commonly reported with kratom [^112ur8do].

---

## Medical management and treatment strategies

There are currently **no standardized clinical guidelines** for kratom withdrawal management, but several treatment strategies have been reported [^1142dPFE]:

- **Supportive care**: Symptomatic treatment, including hydration, nutritional support, and management of specific symptoms (e.g. antiemetics for nausea, antidiarrheals for diarrhea).

- **Buprenorphine-naloxone**: Case reports suggest that buprenorphine-naloxone may be effective in managing severe kratom withdrawal symptoms, particularly in individuals with comorbid opioid use disorder [^113Z8XBb] [^113agPXi] [^116CMfxK].

- **Gradual tapering**: Gradual reduction of kratom dosage is recommended to minimize withdrawal symptoms and prevent relapse.

---

## Potential complications and risks associated with kratom withdrawal

Kratom withdrawal is generally **mild to moderate**. Potential complications and risks include **relapse** due to cravings and discomfort; exacerbation of pre-existing anxiety or depression; and, rarely, severe symptoms requiring medical intervention, particularly in individuals with co-occurring substance use disorders or medical conditions.

Kratom withdrawal symptoms are **generally mild to moderate**, including anxiety, irritability, restlessness, insomnia, muscle aches, gastrointestinal upset, fatigue, and cravings [^112eVye8]. Symptoms typically begin within **12–24 hours**, peak at **2–3 days**, and resolve within **7–10 days**. Severity and duration are influenced by dosage, frequency, duration of use, individual factors, and co-occurring substance use or mental health conditions. Management includes **supportive care**, **gradual tapering**, and, in severe cases, buprenorphine-naloxone.

### Assessment of kratom use disorder and withdrawal among an online convenience sample of US adults [^112eVye8]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Since 2007, kratom use in the United States has increased, centered around nonmedical self-treatment of pain, psychiatric, and substance use disorder symptoms. Reports of kratom withdrawal have emerged amidst descriptions of therapeutic effects, yet we know little about disordered use. Our objective was to assess Diagnostic and Statistical Manual-5 substance use disorder for kratom ("kratom use disorder", KUD) and examine kratom withdrawal symptoms among those who ever used it regularly. We also sought to identify clinical characteristics of respondents who qualified for current, remitted, or never KUD.

- **Methods**: Between April and May 2021, we re-recruited online respondents who reported lifetime kratom use on an unrelated survey into our cross-sectional kratom survey study, permitting a diverse sample of current and former kratom-using persons.

- **Results**: A total of 129/289 (44.6%) evaluable surveys were obtained. Over half (52.7%) of respondents never met KUD diagnostic criteria; 17.8% were assessed as remitted, and 29.5% met the current (past-year) KUD threshold. For past-year KUD, severity was: 14.0% mild, 7.0% moderate, and 8.5% severe. Pain, psychiatric symptoms, and polydrug use were found across all groups. KUD symptoms reflected increased use, tolerance, withdrawal, unsuccessful quit attempts, and craving; 9.3% reported decreases in important social, occupational, or recreational activities because of use. Withdrawal symptoms were moderate and included gastrointestinal upset, restlessness, anxiety, irritability, fatigue/low energy, and craving.

### Controversies in assessment, diagnosis, and treatment of kratom use disorder [^113Qf7vv]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2024). Low credibility.

A DSM-5-based framework for kratom use disorder (KUD) enables the comparison of kratom with other substances using identical sets of diagnostic criteria. However, the limitation of this approach is that, to our knowledge, DSM-5-based criteria for KUD have been applied only to U.S. populations. It is essential to consider problematic kratom use in Southeast Asia, where kratom is indigenous and used within longstanding cultural traditions. Cultural familiarity may potentially offer protection against addiction as the open propagation of drug-related practices and prohibitions, coupled with social learning about their possible benefits and harms, may limit behavioral excesses.

Yet, even in a Southeast Asian sample, more than half of kratom consumers scored medium or high on a proposed scale for "kratom dependence". This scale assessed several substance use disorder (SUD)-like constructs: preoccupation/craving, impaired control, use despite harm, withdrawal, and tolerance. A subsequent review, however, concluded that the most common manifestations of kratom addiction in Southeast Asia are withdrawal symptoms. This finding aligns with self-reports from U.S. consumers, where some may not experience significant withdrawal symptoms upon discontinuation, while others do.

When kratom withdrawal occurs, consumers usually describe it as mild to moderate, specifying symptoms such as kratom craving, low energy, fatigue, irritability, anxiety, depressed mood, restless legs, difficulty sleeping, gastrointestinal upset, cold and hot flashes, goosebumps, and muscle twitches.

### Controversies in assessment, diagnosis, and treatment of kratom use disorder [^113G5HGm]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2024). Low credibility.

Treatment of Kratom Use Disorder (KUD), as with all Substance Use Disorders (SUDs), must be individualized for each patient based on their specific preferences, characteristics, and comorbidities. At the time of writing, Medications for Opioid Use Disorder (MOUD), specifically buprenorphine or buprenorphine-naloxone, have been the most frequent approach for treating kratom-related physical dependence or addiction in the US. In many of these cases, the affected patients were also reported to have a comorbid Opioid Use Disorder (OUD), so that MOUD was an obvious therapeutic approach despite the lack of clinical trials specifically showing the safety or efficacy of MOUD for patients with KUD.

In a small case series, we found that buprenorphine dosing for patients with comorbid KUD/OUD might correlate with the amount of kratom used; however, a larger subsequent case series did not replicate this finding. We therefore recommend that buprenorphine dosing be individually titrated for KUD/OUD patients based on their clinical responses. Although we are not aware of any published cases describing comorbid KUD/OUD treated with methadone or naltrexone, these MOUD options could also be reasonably considered for select patients. We concur with previous authors that, in cases where a patient with KUD presents with comorbid OUD, the use of MOUD (not only buprenorphine, but also naltrexone or methadone when clinically appropriate) should be the first-line treatment as it is for patients with OUD and other comorbid SUDs.

There is little specific information on whether comorbid KUD/OUD patients…

### Treatment of kratom withdrawal and dependence with buprenorphine/naloxone: A case series and systematic literature review [^116CMfxK]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Some opioid use disorder (OUD) patients attempt to self-treat using herbal remedies such as kratom. However, kratom use itself can paradoxically cause physical dependence and OUD. Currently, there are no guidelines for treating patients with OUD stemming from kratom use. Our empirically-based hypothesis was that there would be a correlation between the amount of kratom used and the amount of buprenorphine-naloxone required for opioid agonist therapy.

- **Methods**: This study includes a systematic review assessing the treatment of kratom-dependent patients with buprenorphine-naloxone and a case series of our kratom-dependent patients. We calculated the correlation between the kratom dose and the buprenorphine-naloxone dose required to treat kratom-associated OUD. Our proposed starting doses for using buprenorphine-naloxone to treat kratom OUD were also included.

- **Results**: The OVID MEDLINE (1946–2020) database was searched using the terms "kratom", "buprenorphine", and "case report". This search yielded three relevant cases of patients having kratom OUD who were treated with buprenorphine-naloxone, with the amounts of all substances reported. Review of the bibliographies, citing articles, and Google Scholar turned up three additional cases, yielding six literature cases that were analyzed. We also analyzed two patients from our clinic, giving a total of eight patients included in the Pearson correlation coefficient calculation. We found a strong correlation of 0.84 between these variables, consistent with our hypothesis.

- **Conclusions**: Based on our analysis, patients using less than 20g of kratom per day could be i

### A case of kratom use: Implications for managing addiction and addressing comorbidity in overdose survivors, and for the education of clinicians who are not addiction specialists [^115AaEAp]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

As overdose mortality rises, overdose morbidity — complications seen as a result of overdose events — is rising too. Although comorbidity is often thought of as psychiatric or psychological, a case report of compartment syndrome, rhabdomyolysis, and acute renal insufficiency in a patient who lost consciousness for 6 hours after smoking kratom highlights medical comorbidity. The case is a reminder that a broad range of medical comorbidities can occur in patients with overdose and unhealthy substance use. Patients with these comorbidities will often be cared for by clinicians who are not addiction specialists, who will need to have sufficient training to recognize and address them.

### A case of 7-OH mitragynine use requiring inpatient medically managed withdrawal [^114kJsDJ]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

There is an increased interest in kratom and kratom-related products such as 7-hydroxymitragynine (7-OH). Here we present the case of a patient seeking inpatient substance use treatment for daily 7-OH use and the clinical course of care, including the clinical opiate withdrawal scale (COWS) and medication treatment response.

This is a single case report from an inpatient medically managed withdrawal level of substance use treatment care. A 38-year-old man with a history of opioid use disorder reported escalation of use, including kratom to 7-OH, complicated by the development of use disorder, tolerance, and withdrawal. The patient experienced a withdrawal syndrome consistent with opioid withdrawal upon stopping use, with COWS peaking at 14. The patient was treated with a short course of buprenorphine sublingual (daily dosing 2–8 mg) based on signs and symptoms. He did not want to remain on buprenorphine after the medically managed withdrawal period and was successfully tapered off buprenorphine during his treatment stay and transitioned to a residential level of care.

Given the widespread availability of kratom and kratom-related products, it is important for health care providers to screen for use and development of use disorder and be prepared to provide counseling, support, and treatment for patients.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^113pRDwj]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management for alcohol withdrawal syndrome, specifically with respect to indications for pharmacotherapy in an outpatient setting, the ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend initiating pharmacotherapy with benzodiazepines as first-line therapy in patients with moderate alcohol withdrawal (CIWA-Ar score 10–18). **Alternative options**: Administer carbamazepine or gabapentin. **When benzodiazepines are contraindicated**: Administer carbamazepine, gabapentin, or phenobarbital if the provider is experienced with its use. As an adjunct to benzodiazepines, consider administering carbamazepine, gabapentin, or valproic acid if there is no liver disease or childbearing potential.

### Controversies in assessment, diagnosis, and treatment of kratom use disorder [^1128dPRW]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2024). Low credibility.

The first US-based survey to apply DSM-5-based KUD criteria to kratom-using adults was conducted in 2017. Among 2,798 respondents, 344 (12.3%) met the diagnostic threshold for past-year KUD; of these, 276 (80.2%) reported 2–3 criteria (mild KUD), 51 (14.8%) had 4–5 criteria (moderate KUD), and 17 (4.9%) had 6+ criteria (severe KUD). The authors did not specify how many of the mild KUD cases reported tolerance and withdrawal as their only criteria. A more recent survey of 2,061 respondents in 2023 found that 525 (25.5%) met past-year KUD criteria, most commonly due to tolerance (81.3%) and withdrawal (68.0%). Sampling differences preclude conclusions about whether the higher rate of cases in the second study represents a true increase.

In online surveys conducted in 2020–2021, we identified a subset of adults who had ever used kratom among a broader sample. Initially, this was to represent a range of nonproblematic and problematic use of alcohol and other drugs. We found that, of 2,615 respondents, 289 (11.1%) had ever tried kratom, with 174 (60.2%) of these using kratom within the past year. Kratom use differed from alcohol and tobacco use in a key respect: increases in frequency of alcohol or tobacco use were almost always perceived by respondents as changes for the worse, whereas increases in frequency of kratom use were not.

This suggested that for some respondents, kratom use was not perceived as a net detriment to functioning — a finding that was supported when we recontacted 129 respondents with any lifetime history of kratom use. Of the 122 actively using kratom, 79.8% reported that the…

### Is kratom the new 'legal high' on the block? The case of an emerging opioid receptor agonist with substance abuse potential [^112JCLpd]. Pain Physician (2017). Low credibility.

Kratom is an unscheduled opioid receptor agonist that appears in the form of dietary supplements and is currently abused by chronic pain patients on prescription opioids. Active alkaloids isolated from kratom, such as mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine, are believed to act on mu- and delta-opioid receptors as well as alpha-2 adrenergic and 5-HT2A receptors. Animal studies suggest that kratom may be more potent than morphine, and its consumption produces analgesic and euphoric feelings among users. Particularly, some chronic pain patients on opioids take kratom to counteract the effects of opioid withdrawal.

Although the Food and Drug Administration has banned its use as a dietary supplement, kratom remains widely available and easily accessible on the Internet, often at much lower costs than some opioid replacement therapies like buprenorphine. There are no federal regulations monitoring the sale and distribution of this drug, yet kratom has been associated with severe symptoms, including hallucinations, delusions, depression, myalgia, chills, nausea/vomiting, respiratory hepatotoxicity, seizures, coma, and death.

A search of the pain literature indicates that past research has not thoroughly described the use and potential deleterious effects of this drug. Many pain physicians are not familiar with kratom, and as providers who take care of high-risk chronic pain patients using prescribed opioids, knowledge of unregulated opioid receptor agonists with abuse potential is of paramount importance. The goal of this article is to introduce kratom to pain specialists.

### Controversies in assessment, diagnosis, and treatment of kratom use disorder [^114RivfP]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2024). Low credibility.

Should a KUD assessment be approached differently than other substances? In prior publications, we have cautiously compared daily kratom use to daily caffeine use, and KUD to caffeine addiction. Notably, a diagnosis of caffeine use disorder is forbidden by all DSM editions, although (or perhaps because) many caffeine users would likely meet SUD criteria, particularly per DSM-5, where only two criteria need be met. This differential treatment of caffeine may be due to uncertainty about whether caffeine-related problems constitute a "clinically significant disorder".

DSM-5 includes criteria to assess caffeine intoxication, caffeine withdrawal, unspecified caffeine-related disorder, and other caffeine-induced disorders (e.g. sleep and anxiety disorders). Such assessments may similarly be useful for other legal psychoactive substances like kratom, for which the psychosocial consequences of use are buffered by cultural acceptance of the substance or its typical effects.

Caffeine and kratom product formulations, which vary considerably, are widely available and, apart from scattered state and local kratom prohibitions, are not scheduled under the Controlled Substances Act by the US Drug Enforcement Administration. Thus, the net negative consequences of kratom or caffeine use are socially, culturally, and legally distinct from those of illicit drug use, which confers greater consequential hazard and higher possible DSM-5 criteria endorsement. At the time of writing, many kratom product formulations are primarily consumed orally in leaf-based formulations, with highly concentrated kratom extracts also available.

### Treatment of kratom dependence with buprenorphine-naloxone maintenance [^117Cx3pJ]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Use of the unregulated herbal supplement kratom is on the rise in the United States. We present a case series of two patients who developed kratom dependence and withdrawal, who were successfully transitioned to buprenorphine-naloxone maintenance.

- **Case summary**: Two patients using kratom to self-treat chronic pain after prescription opioids were discontinued presented to our clinic with evidence of kratom dependence and withdrawal. On examination, both patients showed signs of mild opioid withdrawal. Both patients were successfully transitioned to buprenorphine-naloxone maintenance via home initiation, with control of both their opioid withdrawal and chronic pain.

- **Conclusions**: Kratom use is on the rise, with increasing evidence of developing opioid-type dependence due to chronic kratom use. This case series shows that buprenorphine can be used to treat kratom dependence and the underlying chronic pain that drives its use.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^1121KCmu]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of alcohol withdrawal syndrome, especially in the management of withdrawal delirium, the ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend considering the administration of barbiturates as an alternative to benzodiazepines for the treatment of alcohol withdrawal delirium. However, they recognize that barbiturates are not the preferred choice over benzodiazepines. Phenobarbital may be considered as an adjunct to benzodiazepines in closely monitored settings when alcohol withdrawal delirium is not adequately controlled by benzodiazepines alone.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^117Tfpnm]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for alcohol withdrawal syndrome, specifically in the context of managing withdrawal seizures, the ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend the preferential use of parenteral administration of medications following a withdrawal seizure. Intravenous (IV) administration is preferred over intramuscular (IM) administration if available, although IM administration is also effective. The use of parenteral phenobarbital is advised only in highly supervised settings, such as an intensive care unit (ICU) or critical care unit, due to the risk of oversedation and respiratory depression.

### Alcohol withdrawal syndrome [^114cWaGK]. Nursing (2023). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on alcohol withdrawal syndrome:

- **Definition**: AWS is a condition that occurs after the abrupt cessation or significant reduction of alcohol intake following heavy and prolonged use.

- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of AWS involves neuroadaptive changes in the CNS due to chronic alcohol consumption. Chronic alcohol use leads to the upregulation of the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate and the downregulation of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA. When alcohol consumption is abruptly stopped, this results in a hyperadrenergic state and increased glutamatergic activity, causing withdrawal symptoms.

- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for AWS include heavy and prolonged alcohol use, prior withdrawal episodes, concomitant use of other sedative-hypnotics, and comorbid medical or psychiatric conditions.

- **Disease course**: The clinical course of AWS typically begins with mild symptoms, such as tremors, anxiety, and nausea within 6–12 hours of cessation of alcohol intake. More severe symptoms, such as hallucinations and seizures, can occur within 12–48 hours. Delirium tremens, characterized by severe confusion, hallucinations, and cardiovascular instability, typically occurs within 48–96 hours.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Although most cases of AWS are self-limiting and resolve within a week, severe complications such as seizures and delirium tremens can be life-threatening. The use of validated risk assessment tools, such as the PAWSS, can help identify patients at risk of severe AWS and guide management strategies.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^114GS7wr]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of alcohol withdrawal syndrome, particularly in terms of indications for pharmacotherapy in an inpatient setting, the ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend several strategies. If symptoms are not controlled as expected, it may be advisable to consider increasing the medication dose. Additionally, it is important to reassess the appropriate level of care and consider switching medications if oversedation or inadequate monitoring is a concern. If using benzodiazepines, consider adding an adjunct medication to improve management.

### Risk of death associated with kratom use compared to opioids [^116avHvE]. Preventive Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

Kratom use appears to be increasing across the United States, which has led to increased attention to deaths in which kratom use was detected. Most such deaths have been attributed to substances like fentanyl, heroin, benzodiazepines, prescription opioids, cocaine, and other causes such as homicide, suicide, and various preexisting diseases. Kratom is known for having certain opioid-like effects, such as pain relief, and is used by some individuals as a substitute for opioids for pain management or addiction. Consequently, kratom has been compared to "narcotic-like opioids" such as morphine with respect to the risk of death, despite evidence that its primary alkaloid, mitragynine, carries little of the respiratory depressing effects characteristic of morphine-like opioids.

This commentary summarizes animal toxicology data, surveys, and mortality data associated with both opioids and kratom to provide a basis for estimating relative mortality risk. Population-level mortality estimates attributed to opioids compared to kratom, as well as the per-user mortality risks of opioids compared to kratom, are presented. According to our assessments, the risk of overdose death is more than 1,000 times greater for opioids than for kratom. However, the limitations of the mortality risk estimate warrant caution, especially for individuals with unknown factors, such as the use of other substances and medications or other preexisting conditions. More research on kratom safety and risks is necessary, along with regulation of commercial kratom products to ensure that consumers are informed by FDA labeling and that kratom products are not contaminated or adulterated with other substances.

### Controversies in assessment, diagnosis, and treatment of kratom use disorder [^114mLaLc]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2024).

The DSM-5 provides a workaround in that tolerance and withdrawal are not counted toward an SUD diagnosis for medications taken as prescribed by a physician. However, substances like kratom that cannot be prescribed by a physician cannot be similarly exempted. Thus, kratom consumers who meet tolerance and withdrawal criteria could be diagnosed with an SUD, while people with identical patterns or consequences of use for a prescribed drug taken as directed would not be diagnosed with an SUD. This inconsistency complicates comparisons of addiction liability for kratom versus prescribed drugs.

Another significant limitation of applying DSM-5 SUD criteria to kratom addiction is the uncertainty about whether the SUD category truly reflects one diagnostic entity. The DSM-5 workgroup, by collapsing the older categories of "Dependence" and "Abuse" into the single category of SUD, argued that the 11 criteria appeared statistically unidimensional, representing one underlying construct. That unidimensional view of SUDs is probably unrealistic, and the DSM-5 SUD criteria have been criticized for giving identical diagnoses to patients who may have none of the same symptoms. While this heterogeneity may render the DSM-5 SUD criteria unhelpful for studies of etiology or physiopathology, the criteria do identify a category that is clinically and socially meaningful — the subset of patients having physical and/or psychosocial impairments and adverse consequences from substance use.

Finally, the DSM-5 subdivides its SUD criteria into four categories with no cited empirical support: impaired control.

- **Pitfalls of conflating kratom physical dependence with KUD/addiction**: Having chosen this DSM-5-based framework, which reflects the criteria used by US clinicians to evaluate addiction, we note a diagnostic pitfall relevant to kratom. With the shift from DSM-IV to DSM-5, the threshold number of criteria for an SUD diagnosis was reduced from three to two. That change reinstated the possibility of diagnosing an SUD solely based on the criteria of tolerance and withdrawal. The presence of either of those two criteria is traditionally called "physiological dependence" (DSM-IV) or "physical dependence". With the DSM-5, the terminology was updated to "pharmacological criteria for dependence", which avoids the problematic implication that some dependence is not physical.

Here, we use the term "physical dependence" because it remains standard in peer-reviewed literature, but we recommend that tolerance and withdrawal be discussed specifically instead. Each of these two criteria has two parts: the tolerance criterion can be met by a person endorsing using more drug to achieve the same effect, and/or feeling less effect from a given drug amount, while the withdrawal criterion can be either the experience of substance-specific withdrawal symptoms upon cessation or continuing use to avoid such symptoms (negative reinforcement). By those two criteria, an SUD diagnosis would apply to many people who take prescribed psychiatric medications because such medications often induce tolerance on initial titration and cannot be abruptly discontinued without withdrawal symptoms.

### Cardiac arrest in a young healthy male patient secondary to kratom ingestion: is this 'legal high' substance more dangerous than initially thought [^112DDiye]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). Low credibility.

Kratom is a psychoactive herb that exhibits stimulant properties at low doses and opioid-like properties at higher doses. It has been used for centuries in Southeast Asia as a stimulant but has gained increasing popularity as a substitute for opioids in Western countries due to its availability. As most cases of kratom use involve other drugs, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has stopped short of restricting kratom, citing difficulty in assessing the adverse effects of kratom alone.

This paper presents the case of a young, healthy 35-year-old man who suffered cardiac arrest due to kratom use with no other co-ingestants. He was subsequently intubated and found to have systolic dysfunction and small brain infarcts. Fortunately, he made a successful recovery and was discharged following a stay at the behavioral health center. Our case highlights the potential adverse effects of kratom and the need to regulate its use.

### Clinical assessment of the drug interaction potential of the psychotropic natural product kratom [^111Ffpif]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2023). High credibility.

An estimated 2.1 million US residents in 2020 used kratom to self-manage pain and/or opioid withdrawal symptoms. Compared with nonusers or users of cannabis, alcohol, or cigarettes, kratom users have been reported to have a serious substance abuse profile, which includes concomitant use of licit or illicit drugs such as opioids and benzodiazepines. Polysubstance use was observed in 87% of the 156 kratom-related overdose fatalities, suggesting concerns for pharmacokinetic and/or pharmacodynamic adverse kratom-drug interactions.

Kratom has been shown to inhibit CYP enzymes in vitro, including CYP2D6 and CYP3A, which extensively metabolize several opioids and benzodiazepines. An in vitro-in vivo extrapolation based on a mechanistic static model suggested that mitragynine (equivalent to a single 2 g kratom dose) would precipitate a 5.7-fold increase in midazolam AUC. Although static models are known to overpredict the magnitude of an interaction, they provide decision-making information for further investigation. In addition, no human study has been conducted to evaluate the drug interaction potential of kratom. Collectively, the purpose of this work was to address this knowledge gap via a clinical pharmacokinetic kratom-drug interaction study involving healthy adult participants.

### Xyrem [^117YCEac]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Physical dependence is a state that develops due to physiological adaptation in response to repeated drug use, manifested by withdrawal signs and symptoms after abrupt discontinuation or a significant dose reduction of a drug. There have been case reports of withdrawal, ranging from mild to severe, following the discontinuation of illicit use of GHB at frequent repeated doses (18 g to 250 g per day) in excess of the recommended dosage range. Signs and symptoms of GHB withdrawal following abrupt discontinuation included:

- **Mild to moderate withdrawal symptoms**: Insomnia, restlessness, anxiety, lethargy, nausea, tremor, sweating, muscle cramps, tachycardia, headache, dizziness, rebound fatigue and sleepiness, confusion
- **Severe withdrawal symptoms**: Visual hallucinations, agitation, delirium, psychosis

These symptoms generally abated in 3 to 14 days. In severe withdrawal cases, hospitalization may be required. The discontinuation effects of Xyrem have not been systematically evaluated in controlled clinical trials. In the clinical trial experience with Xyrem in narcolepsy/cataplexy patients at recommended doses, two patients reported anxiety and one reported insomnia following abrupt discontinuation at the termination of the clinical trial; in the two patients with anxiety, the frequency of cataplexy had increased markedly at the same time.

- **Tolerance**: Tolerance is a physiological state characterized by a reduced response to a drug after repeated administration, meaning a higher dose of a drug is required to produce the same effect that was once obtained at a lower dose.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^117613y8]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

For the classification and risk stratification of alcohol withdrawal syndrome, with a focus on risk assessment, the ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend evaluating the following factors associated with an increased risk of complicated withdrawal or complications:

- **History of alcohol withdrawal complications**: Includes alcohol withdrawal delirium or alcohol withdrawal seizures.

- **Frequent withdrawal episodes**: Numerous prior withdrawal episodes in the patient's lifetime.

- **Comorbid medical or surgical illness**: Especially conditions such as traumatic brain injury.

- **Advanced age**: Particularly for individuals over 65 years.

- **Prolonged heavy alcohol consumption**: Long duration of heavy and regular alcohol intake.

- **Seizures during withdrawal**: Occurrence of seizures during the withdrawal episode.

- **Marked autonomic hyperactivity**: Notable autonomic hyperactivity upon presentation.

- **Physiological dependence on GABAergic agents**: Dependence on substances like benzodiazepines or barbiturates.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^114s4FGr]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for alcohol withdrawal syndrome, and more specifically concerning anticonvulsants, ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend considering phenobarbital monotherapy (managed by a clinician experienced with its use) in outpatient settings with extensive monitoring. This is suggested as an alternative to benzodiazepines, or when benzodiazepines are contraindicated, in patients with severe alcohol withdrawal or at risk of developing severe or complicated alcohol withdrawal.

### A case of kratom use: Implications for managing addiction and addressing comorbidity in overdose survivors, and for the education of clinicians who are not addiction specialists [^116GhvL5]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

In 2016, the US DEA attempted to reclassify mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine as Schedule 1 drugs due to concerns about public safety. The DEA cited the potential for tolerance, withdrawal, and addiction; unpredictable effects due to the variability of the psychoactive alkaloid content; adulteration of kratom with other psychoactive drugs; and the rising number of deaths and calls to poison centers related to kratom intoxication. The attempt to classify kratom as a Schedule 1 drug, however, was quickly withdrawn in response to public backlash over the decision.

In 2017, the US DHHS also recommended that mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine be classified as Schedule 1 drugs, and the FDA issued a public health advisory related to growing concerns about the risks associated with kratom use. However, at this time, there is no federal regulation on kratom use, though it is illegal to buy, use, or sell in several states and is a controlled substance in 16 other countries.

A group primarily responsible for organizing resistance to attempts to regulate kratom is the American Kratom Association. Their expressed mission is to protect the use of kratom for the purposes of improved health and well-being. Advocates of kratom use point to the low addiction potential compared to other opioids, the need for alternatives to opioid analgesics, the role of kratom in managing opioid withdrawal, and its utility in reducing prescribed and illicit opioid use, particularly in light of the opioid crisis in North America. This perspective highlights the potential benefit.

### Medicines associated with dependence or withdrawal: A mixed-methods public health review and national database study in England [^113pWo9u]. The Lancet. Psychiatry (2019). Low credibility.

With regard to stopping long-term antidepressants, we found patient reports of a range of severe withdrawal symptoms, including severe anxiety, agitation, low mood, and somatic and other symptoms. These symptoms had sudden onset and were protracted and disabling. Although antidepressants are not associated with dependence, anxiety about withdrawal symptoms could dissuade some patients from stopping.

Notably, patients frequently felt that their experiences of withdrawal symptoms were either discounted by clinicians or attributed only as an indication of relapse to depression. The qualitative evidence gathered in this study suggested some positive views of support services but also highlighted a need for better information and discussion of treatment options, improved monitoring of progress during treatment, and more community support. Determining optimal tapering procedures to minimize withdrawal symptoms for patients who wish to discontinue antidepressants is a topic of debate among clinicians.

### Characteristics of deaths associated with kratom use [^111fVcY1]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2019). Low credibility.

Kratom (Mitragyna speciosa Korth) use has increased in Western countries, accompanied by a rising number of associated deaths. There is growing debate about the involvement of kratom in these events.

- **Aims**: This study details the characteristics of such fatalities and provides a 'state-of-the-art' review.

- **Methods**: UK cases were identified from mortality registers by searching with the terms 'kratom', 'mitragynine', etc. Databases and online media were searched using these terms and 'death', 'fatal', 'overdose', 'poisoning', etc. to identify additional cases. Details were obtained from relevant officials. Case characteristics were extracted into an Excel spreadsheet and analyzed using descriptive statistics and thematic analysis.

- **Results**: Typical case characteristics (n = 156) included: male (80%), mean age 32.3 years, White (100%), and a drug abuse history (95%). Reasons for use included self-medication, recreation, relaxation, bodybuilding, and avoiding positive drug tests. Mitragynine alone was identified or implicated in 23% of cases. Polysubstance use was common (87%), typically involving controlled/recreational drugs, therapeutic drugs, and alcohol. Causes of death included toxic effects of kratom, either alone or combined with other substances, and underlying health issues.

- **Conclusions**: These findings add substantially to the knowledge base on kratom-associated deaths, highlighting the need for systematic, accurate recording. Kratom's safety profile remains only partially understood, and toxic and fatal levels require quantification.

### Past-year kratom use in the U.S.: Estimates from a nationally representative sample [^114EaCd9]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Kratom is a plant with partial opioid agonist effects, and its use has become popular to ameliorate symptoms of opioid withdrawal. However, its use has been linked to thousands of poisonings, although most have involved the use of other drugs. Little is known regarding the prevalence and correlates of use in the general U.S. population.

- **Methods**: Data were examined from the 2019 National Survey on Drug Use and Health, a nationally representative probability sample of non-institutionalized individuals aged ≥ 12 years in the U.S. (N = 56,136). Prevalence and correlates of past-year kratom use were estimated. Data were analyzed in 2020.

- **Results**: An estimated 0.7% (95% CI = 0.6, 0.8) of individuals in the U.S. have used kratom in the past year. Past-year proxy diagnosis of prescription opioid use disorder was associated with increased odds for kratom use (AOR = 3.20, 95% CI = 1.38, 7.41), with 10.4% (95% CI = 6.7, 15.9) of those with use disorder reporting use. Opioid misuse not accompanied by use disorder was not associated with kratom use. Those reporting past-year cannabis use both with (AOR = 4.33, 95% CI = 2.61, 7.19) and without (AOR = 4.57, 95% CI = 3.29, 6.35) use disorder, and those reporting past-year cocaine use (AOR = 1.69, 95% CI = 1.06, 2.69) and prescription stimulant misuse (AOR = 2.10, 95% CI = 1.44, 3.05) not accompanied with use disorder were at higher odds for kratom use.

- **Conclusions**: Kratom use is particularly prevalent among those with prescription opioid use disorder, but it is also prevalent among people who use other drugs. Research is needed to determine reasons for use and potential effects.

### A case of kratom use: Implications for managing addiction and addressing comorbidity in overdose survivors, and for the education of clinicians who are not addiction specialists [^114Ln4dN]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

The debate over regulating kratom use and its potential role as a treatment for pain and opioid use disorder is ongoing and, like other active compounds, should ultimately be guided by science and rigorous study. What is not debatable, and what the growing popularity of kratom informs us of, is that physicians and other clinicians should know when to suspect kratom use and ask directly about it in a nonjudgmental and patient-centered way. The reasons for kratom use should be explored, the potential risks and perceived benefits discussed, and FDA-approved treatments for opioid use disorder or other conditions should be offered when indicated. It is known that providing treatment for addiction in hospitalized patients is effective though underutilized. This is particularly relevant for kratom, where knowledge of use may only become apparent after toxicity leads to hospitalization. Use may reflect a pre-existing desire to treat an underlying opioid addiction. Additionally, there is accumulating data suggesting that kratom withdrawal and addiction can be managed in a similar manner as opioid use disorder.

- **Comorbidity and addiction**: The term "comorbidity" when used for patients with addiction often centers around mental health and psychiatric disorders. However, the reported case of kratom use and compartment syndrome is an example of the myriad medical complications that can be associated with unhealthy substance use. Specifically, this patient manifests kidney, liver, cardiac, and musculoskeletal pathology that required the expertise of emergency medicine, nephrology, internal medicine, and surgery.

### Outcomes of mothers and newborns to prenatal exposure to kratom: a systematic review [^112txoZb]. Journal of Perinatology (2021). Low credibility.

Kratom is a legal, widely available substance that contains opioid agonist alkaloids. Due to the marketing of kratom as an opioid alternative for treatment of pain, anxiety, depression, or to reduce opioid withdrawal symptoms, the use of kratom has increased among persons in the United States, including pregnant women. This systematic review of the peer-reviewed literature regarding kratom in relation to maternal and infant outcomes resulted in analysis of six case reports of prenatal kratom exposure. Maternal and infant withdrawal from kratom exposure was described in each case, resulting in pharmacologic treatment for both mothers and infants.

### Clinical assessment of the drug interaction potential of the psychotropic natural product kratom [^116n279w]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2023). Low credibility.

Oral formulations prepared from the leaves of the kratom (Mitragyna speciosa) plant are increasingly used for their opioid-like effects to self-manage opioid withdrawal and pain. Calls to US poison centers involving kratom exposures increased more than 50-fold from 2011–2017, one-third of which reported concomitant use of kratom with drugs of abuse. Many of these drugs are eliminated primarily via cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A and CYP2D6, raising concerns for potential adverse pharmacokinetic kratom-drug interactions.

The impact of a single low dose of kratom tea (2 g) on the pharmacokinetics of the CYP3A probe midazolam (2.5 mg) and CYP2D6 probe dextromethorphan (30 mg) were assessed in 12 healthy adult participants after oral administration. Kratom showed no effect on dextromethorphan area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) and maximum concentration (C max; geometric mean ratio (90% confidence interval) 0.99 (0.83–1.19) and 0.96 (0.78–1.19), respectively) but a modest increase in midazolam AUC and C max (1.39 (1.23–1.57) and 1.50 (1.32–1.70), respectively). Lack of change in midazolam half-life (1.07 (0.98–1.17)) suggested that kratom primarily inhibited intestinal CYP3A.

This inference was further supported by a physiologically based pharmacokinetic drug interaction model using the abundant alkaloid mitragynine, a relatively potent CYP3A time-dependent inhibitor in vitro (K I, ~4 μM; k inact, ~0.07 min −1). This work is the first to clinically evaluate the pharmacokinetic drug interaction potential of kratom. Co-consuming kratom with certain drugs extensively metabolized by these enzymes could pose significant risks.

### Treatment of kratom withdrawal and addiction with buprenorphine [^113Z8XBb]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

In this article, we describe a middle-aged woman with a history of addiction to opioid medications who eventually became dependent on kratom. Her kratom-related withdrawal symptoms responded to a trial of buprenorphine-naloxone. Subsequently, she was maintained on this medication.

### A method for tapering antipsychotic treatment that may minimize the risk of relapse [^112ZPvXb]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2021). High credibility.

Withdrawal syndromes occur with many medications, including all classes of psychotropics. Indeed, withdrawal syndromes are so common that it has been said that drug discontinuation effects are a predictable aspect of the pharmacology of any drug that is eliminated more quickly than the time taken for established adaptations to the drug to resolve.

Receptor antagonists reduce the activation of target receptors. As a result, receptors may be upregulated (increased in sensitivity and/or number). When the antagonist is abruptly withdrawn, physiological levels of the receptor's ligand can cause overstimulation of the sensitized receptors, leading to withdrawal or rebound symptoms. For example, abrupt removal of beta-blockers can cause adrenergic rebound, characterized by increased blood pressure and heart rate, anxiety, headache, and even myocardial infarction.

- **Antipsychotic withdrawal syndrome**: Although not widely recognized, withdrawal symptoms can occur on the cessation of both first- and second-generation antipsychotics (FGAs and SGAs). These symptoms can be grouped into somatic symptoms (nausea, sweating, etc), motor symptoms, and psychological symptoms, including psychosis.

Autonomic and somatic symptoms that occur on cessation generally start within days of dose reduction and resolve within weeks. They are attributed to the abrupt removal of the antagonistic cholinergic, adrenergic, serotonergic, and histaminergic effects of antipsychotics.

### Controversies in assessment, diagnosis, and treatment of kratom use disorder [^115bpKjE]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2024). Low credibility.

The published literature on patients with isolated Kratom Use Disorder (KUD) suggests that buprenorphine may be an effective therapy for them, as well as for those with comorbid KUD/Opioid Use Disorder (OUD). Perhaps reflecting the lack of proven therapeutic options for this population, a survey of US addiction physicians found that, among 19 respondents who reported caring for patients with KUD without comorbid OUD, buprenorphine was the most frequently selected therapy (17/19). However, there has been no systematic study of indications for buprenorphine use to treat KUD in the absence of OUD, and there is limited guidance on the risk-benefit balance of initiating buprenorphine or other Medications for Opioid Use Disorder (MOUD) in this clinical situation. Complicating the picture is the fact that buprenorphine itself has been reported to cause adverse effects in at least one such patient. Initiation of buprenorphine in KUD-only patients should only be done after careful consideration of the risks and benefits by the clinician and patient together, with the fully informed consent of the patient regarding all possible treatment options.

The literature on other MOUD approaches to treat isolated KUD is even more limited. The previously mentioned survey of addiction physicians found that 3/19 reported using naltrexone, and only 1/19 reported using methadone. One published case report briefly describes the use of naltrexone maintenance for a patient with KUD, although no long-term follow-up data were provided. Another case report describes initiating naltrexone in a patient with isolated KUD before switching the patient to buprenorphine due to the lack of data.

### A case of potential pharmacokinetic kratom-drug interactions resulting in toxicity and subsequent treatment of kratom use disorder with buprenorphine/naloxone [^111ZaC5e]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

The botanical product kratom produces opioid-like effects at high doses and is sometimes used for opioid replacement by individuals with opioid use disorder. Mitragynine, a major alkaloid contained in kratom leaves, has been shown to inhibit multiple cytochromes P450 (CYPs) in vitro, including CYP2D6 and CYP3A. As such, kratom may precipitate pharmacokinetic drug interactions when co-consumed with certain medications. We present a case of a patient taking 150 mg venlafaxine (CYP2D6/3A substrate), 300 mg quetiapine (CYP3A substrate), and a high amount of kratom (~90 g) daily. The patient presented to the emergency department with serotonin syndrome and corrected electrocardiogram abnormalities that may have been secondary to supratherapeutic exposure to venlafaxine and/or quetiapine. The patient's symptoms resolved after discontinuation of venlafaxine and quetiapine. He was amenable to medication therapy for kratom discontinuation and successfully completed an at-home induction with buprenorphine/naloxone. This case report adds to the literature about potential pharmacokinetic kratom-drug interactions and suggests that buprenorphine/naloxone can facilitate recovery from kratom use disorder.

### Should antidepressants be used for major depressive disorder [^116Mfi2x]. BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Withdrawal symptoms after SSRIs typically occur within a few days from drug discontinuation and last a few weeks, even with gradual tapering. However, these withdrawal symptoms might include late onset and longer persistence of disturbances, which may be easily misidentified as signs of impending relapse. There are numerous similarities between the withdrawal symptoms associated with SSRIs and those related to antidepressants such as venlafaxine and duloxetine.

A recently published review found that a significant proportion of people who experience withdrawal symptoms after treatment with antidepressants do so for more than two weeks, with some experiencing these symptoms for several months. Withdrawal symptoms may be alleviated by reinstating treatment with the antidepressant that triggered the symptoms. For this reason and many others, it may be difficult for some patients to stop taking antidepressants once treatment has started.

Withdrawal symptoms might also explain why some studies have allegedly shown that the risk of relapse seems to be reduced if antidepressants are continued. This further suggests that patients who discontinue antidepressants might perform worse compared to those who continue their treatment.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^1134qwxL]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for alcohol withdrawal syndrome — more specifically, with respect to indications for pharmacotherapy in an outpatient setting — the ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend considering the initiation of pharmacotherapy at the discretion of providers with extensive experience in the management of alcohol withdrawal for patients with severe, but not complicated, alcohol withdrawal (CIWA-Ar ≥ 19).

- **First-line therapy**: Administer benzodiazepines as first-line therapy.
- **Alternative options**: Administer phenobarbital for providers experienced with its use. If benzodiazepines are contraindicated, consider phenobarbital, carbamazepine, or gabapentin as alternative options.

### Kratom use disorder: Case reports on successful treatment with home induction of buprenorphine-naloxone [^113agPXi]. Family Practice (2023). High credibility.

Kratom has been used for various reasons, such as pain management, opioid withdrawal, and relaxation. It can cause dependence and overdose and is classified under 'drugs of concern' by the US Drug Enforcement Administration. Despite these concerns, kratom remains legal in most of the United States and many countries worldwide, making it easily accessible. Literature searches suggest using buprenorphine (or buprenorphine-naloxone) — medications for treating opioid use disorder — as a treatment for kratom use disorder. However, formal guidelines are not available. In the United States, buprenorphine (or buprenorphine-naloxone) induction is recommended to be conducted under observation, typically in a clinical setting. However, the COVID-19 pandemic has led to shifts toward telehealth.

- **Objectives**: Describe a case series of successful management of kratom use disorder using telehealth, followed by unobserved buprenorphine-naloxone home induction. Additionally, highlight implications for future management, including maintenance dosage and induction method.

- **Methods**: We present two very similar patients with kratom use disorder, both reporting the intake of 35 g of kratom per day, who underwent unobserved buprenorphine-naloxone home induction.

- **Results**: Both patients were initially seen via telehealth. They reported no adverse effects before, during, or after the unobserved home induction on buprenorphine-naloxone but stabilized on significantly different dosages.

- **Conclusion**: Telehealth, followed by unobserved buprenorphine-naloxone induction at home, may offer an alternative to traditional buprenorphine induction methods.

### Alcohol withdrawal syndrome: Outpatient management [^113E6nER]. American Family Physician (2021). Low credibility.

Approximately one-half of patients with alcohol use disorder who abruptly stop or reduce their alcohol use will develop signs or symptoms of alcohol withdrawal syndrome. The syndrome is due to overactivity of the central and autonomic nervous systems, leading to tremors, insomnia, nausea and vomiting, hallucinations, anxiety, and agitation. If untreated or inadequately treated, withdrawal can progress to generalized tonic-clonic seizures, delirium tremens, and death.

- **Assessment tools**: The three-question Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test-Consumption and the Single Alcohol Screening Question instrument have the best accuracy for assessing unhealthy alcohol use in adults 18 years and older. Two commonly used tools to assess withdrawal symptoms are the Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol Scale, Revised, and the Short Alcohol Withdrawal Scale.

Patients with mild to moderate withdrawal symptoms without additional risk factors for developing severe or complicated withdrawal should be treated as outpatients when possible. Ambulatory withdrawal treatment should include supportive care and pharmacotherapy as appropriate. Mild symptoms can be treated with carbamazepine or gabapentin. Benzodiazepines are first-line therapy for moderate to severe symptoms, with carbamazepine and gabapentin as potential adjunctive or alternative therapies. Physicians should monitor outpatients with alcohol withdrawal syndrome daily for up to five days after their last drink to verify symptom improvement and to evaluate the need for additional treatment. Primary care physicians should offer to initiate treatment in such circumstances.

### Controversies in assessment, diagnosis, and treatment of kratom use disorder [^113yAyee]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2024). Low credibility.

As part of the baseline workup for a patient with suspected KUD, we recommend obtaining not just a urine drug screen immunoassay but also confirmatory testing with chromatography-mass spectrometry. This testing is able to detect and ideally also quantify one or more kratom alkaloids. Typically, such testing will detect the most abundant kratom alkaloid, mitragynine, and sometimes its more potently opioidergic metabolite, 7-hydroxymitragynine.

The importance of alkaloid-specific testing is that kratom products are largely unstandardized and unregulated, hence their use carries risks of adulteration, contamination, or substitution with other substances. With appropriate testing, both the clinician and the patient can be reassured that the patient with suspected KUD is actually taking kratom as believed rather than some other substance or substance combination.

### Controversies in assessment, diagnosis, and treatment of kratom use disorder [^115XvFE7]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2024). Low credibility.

Currently, there are no randomized controlled trials or long-term outcome studies on treatment options for Kratom Use Disorder (KUD). Until such systematic studies are published, clinicians need to rely on information from case reports and surveys, combined with their own judgment and experience. In this paper, we have attempted to distill the available knowledge into an algorithm for decision-making.

Although KUD is not listed in DSM-5, it can be assessed and diagnosed using the same 11 criteria as other Substance Use Disorders (SUDs). While KUD shares many features with other SUDs, it has some distinguishing characteristics. Specifically, many patients who meet criteria for a mild KUD diagnosis (equating to 2–3 DSM-5 criteria) will primarily do so because of tolerance and withdrawal, rather than significant psychosocial impairment, although severe psychosocial impairment does occur in a minority of KUD patients.

In addition, clinicians should be aware of the complex nature of KUD, both because kratom use often occurs in the context of polysubstance use and also because the nature of kratom itself (with multiple alkaloids each having multiple actions) mimics the effects of various substances. This includes features of Opioid Use Disorder (OUD) but also of other SUDs, most notably Stimulant Use Disorder (StUD) and the technically undiagnosable caffeine use disorder. As with all SUDs, treatment options must be individualized based on patient characteristics and preferences, with extra care given to developing an appropriate treatment plan for patients who present with isolated KUD in the absence of OUD.

### Controversies in assessment, diagnosis, and treatment of kratom use disorder [^111Q8tcb]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2024). Low credibility.

In the 129 lifetime kratom users, KUD rates were 52.7% never, 17.8% remitted, and 29.5% past-year. Of the latter, 14.0% met the diagnostic threshold by having only two KUD criteria. The most frequently met criteria (in over 30% of cases each) were using more than intended, tolerance, withdrawal, and craving. The least frequently met (in less than 15% of cases each) were interference with obligations, giving up activities, use despite its causing social problems, and use when hazardous.

In 2022, we enrolled a national sample of kratom consumers for 15 days of smartphone-based ecological momentary assessment (EMA), preceded by a baseline survey, with in-person assessments and interviews for a subsample. In this separate sample of 357 daily or near-daily kratom users, the prevalence of KUD (66.7%) was considerably higher than in previous samples. Again, however, the most frequently met criteria were withdrawal, tolerance, using more than intended, and craving. Reports of interference with activities or obligations, or use despite social problems, were rare, even in empirically defined clusters of participants who used kratom more frequently than others. EMA data suggested that the more frequent users had titrated their kratom use to meet their goals, such as self-treating symptoms of opioid use disorder, relieving pain, and increasing energy and productivity, rather than having lost control of their use. Even among those who met KUD criteria, most reported that kratom use conferred benefits and helped them achieve their daily roles and obligations, which is noteworthy.

### New drugs of abuse and withdrawal syndromes [^112JGBPV]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

New drugs of abuse continue to emerge, including synthetic cannabinoids, synthetic cathinones, and hallucinogens. It is important to recognize their individual psychopharmacologic properties, symptoms of intoxication, and symptoms of withdrawal. Providers must be vigilant of acute medical or psychiatric complications that may arise from the use of these substances. Treatment of the patient also includes recognition of any substance use disorders as well as comorbid psychiatric disorders. Although pharmacologic treatments for substance use disorder (of the drugs included in this article) are limited, there are a variety of psychotherapeutic modalities that may be of some benefit.

Because of the danger of withdrawal, abrupt discontinuation of treatment should be avoided (see WARNINGS, PRECAUTIONS, DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE). In all patients, dosage should be reduced gradually when discontinuing therapy or when decreasing the daily dosage. Although there are no systematically collected data to support a specific discontinuation schedule, it is suggested that the daily dosage be decreased by no more than 0.5 mg every three days. Some patients may require an even slower dosage reduction.

In any case, reduction of dose must be undertaken under close supervision and must be gradual. If significant withdrawal symptoms develop, the previous dosing schedule should be reinstituted and, only after stabilization, should a less rapid schedule of discontinuation be attempted. In a controlled postmarketing discontinuation study of panic disorder patients which compared this recommended taper schedule with a slower taper schedule, no difference was observed between the groups in the proportion of patients who tapered to zero dose; however, the slower schedule was associated with a reduction in symptoms associated with a withdrawal syndrome. It is suggested that the dose be reduced by no more than 0.5 mg every 3 days, with the understanding that some patients may benefit from an even more gradual discontinuation. Some patients may prove resistant to all discontinuation regimens.

- **Dosing in special populations**: In elderly patients, in patients with advanced liver disease, or in patients with debilitating disease, the usual starting dose is 0.25 mg.

### Controversies in assessment, diagnosis, and treatment of kratom use disorder [^112KDxmu]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2024). Low credibility.

The question of how to treat patients with kratom use disorder (KUD) and no underlying opioid use disorder (OUD) is more controversial. It is common to see reports referring to kratom alkaloids as "opioids", with ample preclinical data showing that the major kratom alkaloid, mitragynine, is a partial agonist at mu opioid receptors (MORs), and its metabolite, 7-hydroxymitragynine, is a full agonist, although it may not reach high concentrations in plasma, at least in mice. This evidence prompted former United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) commissioner Scott Gottlieb to classify kratom as an opioid with no medical benefit, a position bolstered by the FDA's in silico studies of kratom alkaloid binding to opioid receptors. The anecdotal evidence from human studies, patient reports, and case studies regarding the opioid-like effects of kratom — and the opioid withdrawal-like effects upon cessation — should also be considered seriously.

However, we argue that even isolated KUD should be considered more akin to multiple substance use disorders (SUDs) because kratom contains dozens of alkaloids, many of which have actions beyond MOR binding. These include kappa and delta opioid antagonism, alpha-2 adrenergic agonism, 5-HT 1A agonism, and potentially adenosinergic antagonism, along with a complex array of dopaminergic actions, some potentially antidopaminergic. As a result, patients with KUD may present with features of OUD, mixed with other SUD characteristics such as those seen in stimulant use disorder (StUD).

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^117VU6eH]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for alcohol withdrawal syndrome, more specifically concerning clinical assessment, the ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend assessing the quantity, frequency, and last consumption time of alcohol in patients presenting with signs and symptoms suggestive of alcohol withdrawal, to determine whether they are experiencing or at risk for developing alcohol withdrawal. Consider using a scale to screen for unhealthy alcohol use, such as the AUDIT-Piccinelli Consumption, acquiring information from collateral sources such as family and friends, and obtaining a laboratory test providing some measure of hepatic function for this assessment.

### Isolated kratom use disorder treated with extended-release buprenorphine taper [^116DTQmG]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

This case report highlights a 36-year-old male without a history of psychiatric disease, chronic pain, or substance use disorder who developed severe substance use disorder to kratom, as per the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition criteria. He was successfully treated with sublingual buprenorphine following a 3-year period of intermittent withdrawal management and trials of oral and extended-release injectable naltrexone. After a period of abstinence from kratom, he was tapered from buprenorphine using two monthly injections of 100 mg extended-release buprenorphine. His case underscores some of the uncertainties around kratom use disorder diagnosis and treatment.

### A case of kratom use: Implications for managing addiction and addressing comorbidity in overdose survivors, and for the education of clinicians who are not addiction specialists [^112mWTpH]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Kratom use appears to be growing in the United States (US), though the true prevalence is largely unknown. One recent study estimated the prevalence of past year kratom use in the US to be 0.8% and the American Kratom Association reports that nearly 5 million individuals have used kratom. People who use kratom report a range of indications, including relieving opioid withdrawal, helping decrease or taper off prescribed or illicit opioids, treating pain and mental health symptoms such as anxiety, and for recreational use. Kratom is marketed as an herbal drug derived from the *Mitragyna speciosa* tree and imported to the US from Southeast Asia.

The primary psychoactive elements are the alkaloids mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine, which behave as partial agonists at the mu opioid receptor and as competitive antagonists of the delta and kappa opioid receptors. At low doses, kratom has a stimulatory effect, while at higher doses it has a sedative and analgesic effect.

### Controversies in assessment, diagnosis, and treatment of kratom use disorder [^116w54KE]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2024). Low credibility.

The extent to which isolated kratom use disorder (KUD) can be successfully treated with non-medication-assisted opioid use disorder (MOUD) strategies, such as contingency management (CM) or psychotherapy alone, is unknown. In the mentioned survey of addiction physicians, seven of the 19 who had treated patients with isolated KUD reported using psychotherapy as an adjunct to MOUD, while another reported using psychotherapy alone.

As in patients with comorbid KUD and opioid use disorder (OUD), the use of CM or psychotherapy for isolated KUD is unlikely to cause harm, despite being of unknown efficacy. Supportive pharmacotherapies for kratom withdrawal to treat presenting withdrawal symptoms, along with psychotherapy, should be considered for isolated KUD patients who are willing to use them, either alone or in combination with MOUD if the use of MOUD is deemed clinically appropriate.

An algorithm of treatment considerations for KUD/OUD and isolated KUD can be found in Figure 1.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^1113W8sF]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of alcohol withdrawal syndrome, specifically with respect to indications for pharmacotherapy in an inpatient setting, the ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend initiating pharmacotherapy with benzodiazepines as the first-line therapy in patients with moderate alcohol withdrawal (CIWA-Ar score 10–18). Consider administering carbamazepine or gabapentin as alternative options. Additionally, carbamazepine, gabapentin, or phenobarbital (for providers experienced with its use) may be administered if benzodiazepines are contraindicated. Consider using carbamazepine, gabapentin, or valproic acid (if there is no liver disease or childbearing potential) as an adjunct to benzodiazepines.

### The impact of diverse kratom products on use patterns, dependence, and toxicity [^115GFaYz]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2025). Low credibility.

Kratom products have been available in the US for over a decade. Initially, these products were almost entirely made from kratom leaf material and formulated in powders, capsules, or tablets. Recently, more diverse kratom products and derivatives have been marketed and sold, including extracts, concentrates, and isolates. This review focuses on the differing symptom presentation of products containing concentrated or isolated kratom-derived alkaloids that may cause substantial risks to consumers.

- **Recent findings**: Several concentrated or semi-synthetic products have entered the market recently, advertised as kratom but pharmacologically bearing little similarity to traditional kratom. Although the alkaloid content naturally ranges from 2 to 5% in native leaf material, it can be up to 60% in concentrated extracts. Most concerning are the products containing pure, isolated 7-hydroxymitragynine and mitragynine pseudoindoxyl. These derivatives of kratom alkaloids are not naturally present in leaf material but function as more potent opioid agonists than morphine. Products marketed as kratom but containing much higher alkaloid concentrations than found in the natural kratom leaf, or semi-synthetic isolates of highly potent alkaloid derivatives not typically found in the plant, represent a growing public health concern. There is minimal clinical research to assess their safety or regulation to ensure safe manufacturing practices. Limited pre-clinical data indicate that these products pose a greater risk of toxicity, drug interactions, and physiological harm.

### Prevalence of kratom use disorder among kratom consumers [^11717FNy]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

Kratom leaf products are increasingly consumed in the United States, with many consumers reporting they experience beneficial effects from kratom use. However, there is a growing concern for kratom's potential to result in dependence when used regularly. As such, we sought to assess, using Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) diagnostic criteria for substance use disorder, the prevalence of "kratom use disorder" (KUD) among kratom consumers.

- **Methods**: Our cross-sectional study used an online, anonymous survey between February and May 2023. Through nonprobability sampling, we recruited people older than 18 years who currently consume kratom. Participants were asked about their kratom consumption patterns, adverse effects perceived to stem from kratom consumption, comorbid diagnoses, and components for a DSM-5 substance use disorder, adapted for kratom.

- **Results**: Among the total sample (N = 2061), KUD criteria were met by 25.5% of participants (n = 525); the most commonly reported symptoms were tolerance (n = 427, 81.3%) and withdrawal (n = 357, 68.0%). After adjusting for age, gender, daily frequency of kratom consumption, and history of either a substance use disorder or a mental health condition, those with a diagnosis of another substance use disorder had 2.83 times higher odds of meeting KUD criteria (95% CI, 2.19–3.67) compared with those without one.

In this large cross-sectional study, most participants who met the criteria for a KUD diagnosis were categorized as having a mild or moderate KUD.

### Controversies in assessment, diagnosis, and treatment of kratom use disorder [^1142dPFE]. Current psychiatry reports (2024). High credibility.

The purpose of this review is to apply the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5), criteria for substance use disorders (SUDs) to the herbal product kratom. Similarities and differences between kratom use disorder (KUD) and other SUDs are explored, along with assessment, diagnostic, and therapeutic recommendations for KUD.

Recent findings indicate that literature reports of "kratom addiction" or KUD rarely specify the criteria by which patients were diagnosed. Individuals meeting DSM-5 KUD criteria typically exhibit tolerance, withdrawal, using more than intended, and cravings, rather than functional or psychosocial disruption, which occurs rarely. Most clinicians who use medication to treat patients with isolated KUD select buprenorphine formulations, despite the lack of controlled studies demonstrating that buprenorphine is safe or effective for this patient population. Diagnosis and treatment decisions for KUD should be systematic, and we propose an algorithm that takes into consideration whether KUD occurs with comorbid opioid use disorder.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^114E3L4E]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of alcohol withdrawal syndrome, particularly concerning indications for pharmacotherapy in outpatient settings, the ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend initiating pharmacotherapy for patients at risk of developing new or worsening signs or symptoms of withdrawal while not in outpatient treatment settings. This is especially pertinent for those with a history of withdrawal episodes of at least moderate severity who are within the window for symptom development in the withdrawal timeline.

- **Recommended treatments**: Administer benzodiazepines, carbamazepine, or gabapentin as monotherapy. Alternatively, administer at least a single dose of benzodiazepine, followed by ongoing treatment based on symptom severity.

- **Patient monitoring**: Reassess patients frequently over the next 24 hours to monitor their need for withdrawal medication if the risk of developing severe withdrawal symptoms is unknown.

### Controversies in assessment, diagnosis, and treatment of kratom use disorder [^114gtJjo]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2024). High credibility.

The DSM-5 criteria for substance use disorders (SUDs) characterize addiction based on its consequences. No single DSM-5 criterion is necessary or sufficient for the diagnosis of an SUD. The criteria do not directly reflect the frequency of use, and they largely overlook motivations for use, except for using substances to avoid withdrawal symptoms. Drug use for self-medication to relieve negative emotions or achieve euphoria (i.e. a recreational "high") is not pathognomonic for an SUD. The only known proposal to incorporate drug use motivations into SUD criteria suggests a diagnostic exemption for the use of opioids to alleviate physical pain. This proposal has not gained traction; the diagnosis of SUD remains largely guided by the net consequences of substance use.

In this paper, we apply the DSM-5 framework to define addiction to Mitragyna speciosa, commonly known as "kratom", a psychoactive botanical with increasing use. We classify kratom addiction as Kratom Use Disorder (KUD), aligning with DSM-5 classifications. The DSM-5 SUD chapter includes several substance-specific diagnoses, followed by an "other" category with guidelines: "When the substance is known, it should be reflected in the name of the disorder upon coding (e.g. nitrous oxide use disorder)". Although KUD is not specifically named in the DSM-5, it is an acceptable DSM-5 diagnosis. Evaluating a patient's kratom use is complex due to the intricate pharmacology of kratom leaves, the proliferation of kratom product formulations, and frequent co-use with other substances.
