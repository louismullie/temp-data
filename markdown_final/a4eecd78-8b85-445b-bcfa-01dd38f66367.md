## Question

Should steroids be discontinued prior to dental surgery?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether steroids should be discontinued prior to dental surgery and what the perioperative management should be if a patient is on chronic corticosteroids. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about which steroid regimens actually suppress the HPA axis and for how long. Then, I should classify the physiologic stress of typical dental procedures. Next, I will review authoritative guidelines on perioperative steroid management and assess the risks of discontinuation versus continuation. After that, I need to translate this into a practical dosing strategy for minor versus more invasive dental surgery, and finally consider special situations that might modify the plan before synthesizing a clear recommendation [^116jjEMT] [^112Bs4iG].

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and definitions, because precision here drives the right plan: chronic therapeutic glucocorticoids at or above about 5 mg prednisolone equivalent daily for a month or more can suppress the HPA axis, and this applies across routes (oral, inhaled, intranasal, intra-articular, topical) when exposure is sufficient; even topical steroids can be systemically absorbed and contribute to suppression in some scenarios, so I need to ask about potency, surface area, and occlusion before I assume "topical is safe" [^116jjEMT] [^113nr8zP].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about stopping therapy; chronic exogenous steroids are the most common cause of secondary/tertiary adrenal insufficiency in surgical patients, and abrupt cessation or inadequate perioperative coverage can precipitate adrenal crisis with hypotension and shock, so the dominant risk in the perioperative window is under-replacement during stress, not bleeding or infection from continued steroids per se [^116jjEMT] [^113RVW44].

> I need to check the stress level of dental procedures next, because supplementation should match physiologic demand; even "minor" oral surgery triggers a measurable cortisol response proportional to invasiveness, and for procedures under local anesthesia there is still stress dosing guidance for patients at risk or with uncertain HPA recovery, including those who recently tapered off steroids without documented axis normalization [^112u8Qza] [^113RVW44].

> Next, I should review high-quality guidance to anchor decisions; the UK Association of Anaesthetists recommend identifying patients at risk of suppression and providing perioperative supplementation rather than withdrawal, the European Society of Endocrinology advises stress dosing for at-risk patients including those recently off steroids without proven HPA recovery, and GINA advises perioperative hydrocortisone for patients with recent or current high-dose ICS or oral steroids because of adrenal crisis risk; real-world PREdS audit data show most patients on ≥ 5 mg prednisolone equivalent received perioperative hydrocortisone, reflecting standard practice toward supplementation, not discontinuation [^116jjEMT] [^113RVW44] [^1125YcRt] [^112LDNpf].

> Let me consider the balance of risks if I continue versus stop; discontinuing or even under-dosing risks adrenal crisis and hemodynamic instability during surgical stress, while continuation with appropriate supplementation mainly raises manageable concerns like transient hyperglycemia and possibly a modest increase in wound-healing issues in some maxillofacial settings; importantly, dental and maxillofacial literature shows perioperative steroids reduce edema and trismus after third molar and orthognathic surgery, so there is procedure-specific benefit, whereas I do not see evidence that stopping pre-op reduces complications in dental surgery contexts [^113RVW44] [^116Sq35o] [^116xV1oV] [^112ULYSa].

> Now, translating guidelines to a practical peri-dental plan, I should confirm the baseline steroid dose and duration, continue the patient's usual morning dose on the day of procedure, and layer stress coverage based on invasiveness; for minor procedures under local anesthesia in patients with known or possible suppression, a common approach is to give an oral stress dose equivalent to hydrocortisone 40 mg total that day divided, or a small IV dose at the time of the procedure when oral intake is unreliable; for more invasive oral/maxillofacial procedures, a pragmatic regimen is hydrocortisone 50–100 mg IV at the start with rapid de-escalation over 24–48 hours back to baseline if the clinical course is uncomplicated, aligning with the principle of matching coverage to stress and minimizing duration [^113RVW44] [^116jjEMT] [^1125YcRt].

> Wait, I should verify how to handle those at the low end of exposure; patients on less than about 5 mg prednisolone equivalent daily for under a month are unlikely to be suppressed and usually do not need supplemental dosing, but abrupt cessation is still unsafe, so they should continue their maintenance dose and be monitored clinically, escalating only if symptoms or hemodynamics suggest insufficiency during the perioperative period [^116jjEMT].

> I will now examine dental-specific modifiers; perioperative dexamethasone is frequently used to reduce postoperative swelling and trismus and can improve patient-centered outcomes after third molar surgery without clear increases in bleeding, though wound-healing signals have been variably reported and should be contextualized with dose and patient comorbidity; in diabetics, I need to ensure glucose monitoring and adjustment of antihyperglycemics because transient hyperglycemia is expected, and for patients with concern for bone health on long-term steroids, manage osteoporosis prophylaxis and MRONJ risk separately because those issues do not justify perioperative steroid withdrawal for a dental procedure [^116xV1oV] [^116Sq35o] [^1163UAxy] [^112nb4WM].

> But wait, what if someone cites GI surgery guidance that recommends tapering steroids before operation; I should double-check that nuance: ECCO and emergency surgery guidance for Crohn's advocate weaning steroids several weeks preoperatively to reduce postoperative complications in bowel surgery, which reflects different infectious and anastomotic risk profiles than routine dental procedures, so that disease- and surgery-specific advice should not be extrapolated to outpatient dental surgery where adrenal crisis prevention remains paramount [^117HC4SD] [^1169M7nV].

> Let me synthesize and confirm the bottom line before concluding; for patients on chronic therapeutic steroids undergoing dental surgery, do not discontinue steroids preoperatively, continue the baseline regimen, provide stress-dose coverage proportionate to procedural stress if there is known or suspected HPA suppression, and then promptly return to baseline dosing as recovery allows, because the immediate and potentially fatal risk of adrenal crisis outweighs the more modest and manageable risks from continued steroids in this setting [^113RVW44] [^116jjEMT] [^1125YcRt] [^112LDNpf].

> Practical checklist I need to ensure is followed: verify dose and duration and route of steroids, screen for suppression risk including potent topical or inhaled exposure, coordinate with the prescribing clinician if tapering was in progress, choose stress coverage matching invasiveness and the ability to take oral medications, monitor vitals and glucose post-procedure, and de-escalate quickly back to maintenance dosing while educating the patient on symptoms of adrenal insufficiency and when to seek help [^112Bs4iG] [^113RVW44] [^116jjEMT].

No, **do not stop chronic systemic steroids** before dental surgery [^113RVW44]. Stopping steroids risks adrenal crisis [^112Bs4iG]; instead, **continue the usual dose** and provide **stress-dose hydrocortisone** [^116jjEMT] for moderate-to-major procedures or if the patient is at risk of adrenal suppression [^1125YcRt]. For minor procedures under local anesthesia, continue the regular dose without supplementation. Coordinate with the prescribing physician [^112LDNpf], monitor for adrenal insufficiency [^1177twrz], and use local hemostatic measures to manage bleeding [^115HxpV6].

---

## Risks of stopping steroids abruptly

Abrupt cessation of chronic steroids **can cause adrenal insufficiency or crisis** [^113RVW44], which can lead to hypotension, shock, and death [^113Uzw12] [^1125YcRt]. Risk depends on **dose, duration, and individual susceptibility** [^1142FRtj].

---

## Current clinical guidelines

Guidelines recommend **continuing chronic steroids perioperatively** [^116jjEMT] and providing **stress-dose coverage** [^113RVW44] according to procedure severity and risk of adrenal suppression [^1125YcRt] [^112LDNpf].

---

## Recommended perioperative steroid management

| **Procedure severity** | **Recommended steroid management** |
|-|-|
| Minor (e.g. simple extraction, scaling) | Continue usual dose; no supplementation |
| Moderate (e.g. multiple extractions, implants) | Continue usual dose; hydrocortisone 25–50 mg IV/IM pre-op, then 25 mg every 8 hours for 24 hours |
| Major (e.g. extensive surgery, general anesthesia) | Continue usual dose; hydrocortisone 100 mg IV/IM pre-op, then 50 mg every 8 hours for 24–48 hours |

## Risks of continuing steroids

Continuing steroids **increases infection risk**, impairs wound healing [^112ULYSa], and can cause hyperglycemia and hypertension. These risks can be mitigated with aseptic technique, local hemostasis, and close monitoring.

---

## Patient-specific factors

- **Dose and duration**: Higher doses and longer use increase adrenal suppression risk [^112Bs4iG].
- **Underlying condition**: Severe disease may need higher perioperative doses [^116jjEMT].
- **Individual susceptibility**: Variable risk of adrenal suppression [^112u8Qza].

---

## Clinical outcomes

Continuing steroids with appropriate stress dosing **prevents adrenal crisis** and maintains stability [^113RVW44] [^1177twrz]. Stopping steroids increases **adrenal insufficiency risk** and can worsen outcomes [^113RVW44] [^113Uzw12].

---

## Practical recommendations

- **Continue steroids**: Do not stop before dental surgery [^113RVW44].
- **Stress dosing**: Provide based on procedure severity and suppression risk [^116jjEMT].
- **Coordination**: Work with the prescribing physician [^112LDNpf].
- **Monitoring**: Watch for adrenal insufficiency and manage complications [^1177twrz].

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^1125YcRt]. GINA (2025). High credibility.

Regarding perioperative care for asthma, specifically in the context of management, GINA 2025 guidelines recommend evaluating the risks of performing surgery without achieving good asthma control against the necessity for immediate surgery in patients requiring emergency procedures. Administer perioperative hydrocortisone to patients on long-term high-dose inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) or those receiving oral corticosteroids for more than two weeks during the previous six months, due to the risk of adrenal crisis in the surgical context.

### Guidelines for the management of glucocorticoids during the peri-operative period for patients with adrenal insufficiency: Guidelines from the Association of Anaesthetists, the Royal College of Physicians and the Society for Endocrinology UK [^116jjEMT]. Anaesthesia (2020). Low credibility.

These guidelines aim to ensure that patients with adrenal insufficiency are identified and adequately supplemented with glucocorticoids during the peri-operative period. There are two major categories of adrenal insufficiency. Primary adrenal insufficiency is due to diseases of the adrenal gland (failure of the hormone-producing gland), and secondary adrenal insufficiency is due to deficient adrenocorticotropin hormone secretion by the pituitary gland or deficient corticotropin-releasing hormone secretion by the hypothalamus (failure of the regulatory centers). Patients taking physiological replacement doses of corticosteroids for either primary or secondary adrenal insufficiency are at significant risk of adrenal crisis and must be given stress doses of hydrocortisone during the peri-operative period.

Many more patients, other than those with adrenal and hypothalamic-pituitary causes of adrenal failure, are receiving glucocorticoids as treatment for other medical conditions. Daily doses of prednisolone of 5 mg or greater in adults and 10–15 mg.m-2 hydrocortisone equivalent or greater in children may result in hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis suppression if administered for one month or more by oral, inhaled, intranasal, intra-articular, or topical routes; this chronic administration of glucocorticoids is the most common cause of secondary adrenal suppression, sometimes referred to as tertiary adrenal insufficiency.

A pragmatic approach to adrenal replacement during major stress is required; considering the evidence available, blanket recommendations would not be appropriate.

### Dental surgery and antiplatelet agents: Bleed or die [^115HxpV6]. The American Journal of Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

In patients taking antiplatelet medications who are undergoing dental surgery, physicians and dentists must weigh the bleeding risks of continuing antiplatelet medications versus the thrombotic risks of interrupting them. Bleeding complications requiring more than local measures for hemostasis are rare after dental surgery in patients taking antiplatelet medications. Conversely, the risk for thrombotic complications after interruption of antiplatelet therapy for dental procedures is apparently significant, although small.

When a clinician is faced with the decision to continue or interrupt antiplatelet therapy for a dental surgical patient, it comes down to "bleed or die". There is a remote chance that continuing antiplatelet therapy will result in a nonfatal bleeding problem requiring more than local measures for hemostasis, versus a small but significant chance that interrupting antiplatelet therapy will result in a possibly fatal thromboembolic complication. The decision is clear: it is time to stop interrupting antiplatelet therapy for dental surgery.

### Entocort EC [^115qA2yX]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2009). Low credibility.

- **Medical history considerations**: If you had an allergic reaction to any medicine in the past, inform your healthcare provider. Also, disclose whether you have ever had liver problems as these can affect the amount of Entocort EC that stays in your system, potentially requiring a dosage adjustment. Notify your provider if you or anyone in your family has had diabetes, glaucoma, tuberculosis, high blood pressure, osteoporosis, ulcers, or cataracts.

- **Medication interactions**: Provide a list of all the prescription and nonprescription medicines you currently take. This includes ketoconazole, which can impact the liver's processing of Entocort EC, as well as any steroids like prednisone or other drugs that suppress the immune system.

- **Pregnancy and breastfeeding**: If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant, or plan to get pregnant, discuss with your provider whether Entocort EC is suitable for you. If you are breastfeeding, consult your provider as Entocort EC is present in human milk and may harm the baby. Your provider should advise whether to stop breastfeeding to take Entocort EC or to consider alternative treatments.

- **Surgical considerations**: If you are about to undergo surgery for any reason, your dosage may need to be adjusted accordingly.

- **Immune system status**: Inform your provider if you have chickenpox, measles, or any other condition that suppresses the immune system.

### Endothelial glycocalyx in acute care surgery - what anaesthesiologists need to know for clinical practice [^116pKxf6]. BMC Anesthesiology (2019). Low credibility.

In the context of acute care surgery, the administration of steroids serves several key purposes: anti-oedematous effects in brain surgery and airway complications, immunosuppressive actions in transplants, and anti-emetic therapy for postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV). Patients on long-term, high-dose corticosteroid therapy often require a "stress-dose" of hydrocortisone. Experimental studies by Chappell et al. induced stress via TNF-alpha infusion in guinea pig hearts, revealing substantial endothelial glycocalyx (EG) destruction in coronary vessels. Pretreatment with hydrocortisone significantly attenuated these changes. In ischemia and reperfusion scenarios, hydrocortisone administration mitigated inflammation and protected against the 'low-reflow' phenomenon. Additionally, hydrocortisone use is recommended in the Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines for patients experiencing septic shock unresponsive to fluids and vasopressors.

Antibiotics play a crucial role in acute care surgery, functioning as perioperative prophylaxis or as targeted infection treatments. The action of certain antibiotics is intricately linked to the bacterial glycocalyx, which shares a composition akin to EG. Despite this, there is a surprising lack of information regarding how antibiotic treatment affects EG. Research by Lipowsky et al. demonstrated that sub-antimicrobial doses of doxycycline reduced chemoattractant-induced EG shedding through matrix metalloprotease (MMP) inhibition. Additionally, L-658758, a cephalosporin-based agent, exhibits relevant activity.

### Bisphosphonates for steroid-induced osteoporosis [^115aBpSc]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 1999. Corticosteroids are widely used in inflammatory conditions as an immunosuppressive agent. Bone loss is a serious side effect of this therapy. Several studies have examined the use of bisphosphonates in the prevention and treatment of glucocorticosteroid-induced osteoporosis (GIOP) and have reported varying magnitudes of effect.

- **Objectives**: To assess the benefits and harms of bisphosphonates for the prevention and treatment of GIOP in adults.

- **Search methods**: We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and Embase up to April 2016 and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (IPA) via OVID up to January 2012 for relevant articles and conference proceedings with no language restrictions. We searched two clinical trial registries for ongoing and recently completed studies (ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) search portal). We also reviewed reference lists of relevant review articles.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) satisfying the following criteria: 1) prevention or treatment of GIOP; 2) adults taking a mean steroid dose of 5.0 mg/day or more; 3) active treatment including bisphosphonates of any type alone or in combination with calcium or vitamin D; 4) comparator treatment including a control of calcium or vitamin D, or both, alone or with placebo; and 5) reporting relevant outcomes. We excluded trials that included people with transplant-associated steroid use.

- **Data collection and analysis**: At least t

### European Society of Endocrinology and Endocrine Society joint clinical guideline: Diagnosis and therapy of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency [^112Bs4iG]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Despite their efficacy as anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive agents, the chronic use of glucocorticoids can induce manifestations of Cushing syndrome, along with concomitant central and later permanent adrenal insufficiency (suppression of the entire HPA axis). For this reason, clinicians prescribing glucocorticoids for non-endocrine reasons are advised to employ the lowest effective dose and duration of therapy and consider tapering glucocorticoid doses when treatment is no longer necessary for the underlying condition.

Given the widespread use of glucocorticoids, it is imperative that treating physicians of any discipline be well-versed in the clinical consequences of long-term supraphysiologic glucocorticoid therapy and the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency. It is equally critical to recognize signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency and be experienced in methods to taper and/or stop glucocorticoids once their pharmacologic effects are no longer required.

The management of glucocorticoid therapy is considered a general medical skill that should be managed by the prescribing clinician, also taking into consideration the underlying disease as a determinant of tapering speed. Furthermore, the affected number of patients (at least 1% of the general population) is too large, with too few endocrinology providers to perform consultations for each instance of glucocorticoid tapering. When prescribing clinicians decide that glucocorticoid therapy is no longer required, they should educate their patient on methods.

### Peri-operative replacement of exogenous steroids (PREdS): A national audit of current peri-operative prescribing for patients taking therapeutic steroids [^112LDNpf]. Anaesthesia (2024). High credibility.

Approximately 1% of the UK population takes oral corticosteroids for ≥ 28 days each year for two primary reasons: deficiency in corticosteroids requiring replacement or therapeutic corticosteroids for inflammatory conditions. Acute deficiency can occur during times of physiological stress, such as surgery, potentially leading to major complications. The Association of Anaesthetists' 2020 consensus guideline provides detailed advice for the management of glucocorticoids during the peri-operative period for patients with adrenal insufficiency. This national audit aimed to assess compliance with this guideline.

- **Methods**: Data were collected from 59 Trusts over 14 consecutive days for all eligible patients undergoing procedures under the care of an anaesthetist. Patients prescribed ≥ 5mg oral prednisolone equivalents pre-operatively, in whom supplementary corticosteroid would be indicated, were compared with those prescribed < 5mg oral prednisolone equivalents.

- **Results**: Operations for 21,731 patients were audited; 277 (1.3%) patients were taking therapeutic corticosteroids. Detailed peri-operative data were collected for all patients receiving therapeutic corticosteroids: 201 out of 277 (73%) were ASA physical status ≥ 3; 184 out of 277 (66%) underwent elective procedures; and 252 out of 277 (91%) were prescribed prednisolone pre-operatively, of whom 219 out of 277 (79%) were prescribed ≥ 5mg oral prednisolone equivalents. Among patients prescribed ≥ 5mg oral prednisolone equivalents, 186 out of 219 (85%) received pre-operative glucocorticoid supplementation and 97 out of 219 (42%) received it post-operatively.

### Medrol [^112SCi3F]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

When considering alternate day therapy (ADT), several important factors should be noted. Basic principles and indications for corticosteroid therapy must apply, and the benefits of ADT should not lead to the indiscriminate use of steroids. ADT is a therapeutic technique primarily intended for patients who anticipate long-term pharmacologic corticoid therapy.

In less severe disease processes where corticoid therapy is indicated, it may be possible to initiate treatment with ADT. However, more severe diseases usually require daily divided high-dose therapy for initial disease control. The initial suppressive dose level should be maintained until a satisfactory clinical response is achieved, typically within four to ten days for many allergic and collagen diseases. It is crucial to keep the initial suppressive dose period brief, especially if alternate day therapy is planned subsequently.

Once disease control is established, two options are available:

- **Course (a)**: Change to ADT and gradually reduce the corticoid dose given every other day
- **Course (b)**: After controlling the disease process, rapidly reduce the daily corticoid dose to the lowest effective level, then transition to an alternate day schedule.

Theoretically, course (a) may be preferable. Due to the advantages of ADT, it may be beneficial to consider this therapy for patients who have been on daily corticoids for extended periods, such as those with rheumatoid arthritis. Since these patients may already have a suppressed HPA axis, establishing th

### Prevalence and outcomes of patients taking oral corticosteroids for over 1 month undergoing major surgery in England 2010–2020 [^111mcSZp]. Anaesthesia (2025). High credibility.

The high-, short-, and mid-term mortality from this cohort study suggests that patients taking oral corticosteroids for more than 28 days and undergoing major surgery warrants further study. Since 1 in 29 patients undergoing all major surgery would be eligible for recruitment, it is likely that large-scale, randomized trials of supplementation regimens would be feasible. This would answer questions of peri-operative supplementation, but not those of patient selection, shared decision-making, optimization, and rehabilitation.

Work should also continue using routinely-collected data (to be as inclusive and ensure sufficient generalizability) to establish whether it is the corticosteroids, the background condition, variations in peri-operative supplementation, or a combination of these that impacts clinical outcomes. This would allow more accurate risk prediction and mitigation for those taking oral corticosteroids and contemplating major surgery.

In our previous work, we have shown that there is significant variation in UK practice in terms of who is supplemented in the peri-operative period, what they are given, and for how long. Most practitioners do not follow the published national guidelines despite saying (or at least thinking) that they are doing so. Given this situation, guidelines should focus on identifying the patients who require supplementation. A reasonable approach for the future should be implementation research. Implementation research is "the scientific inquiry into questions concerning implementation – the act of carrying an intention into effect, which in health.

### Medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw: MASCC/ISOO/ASCO clinical practice guideline [^1173ma51]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2019). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (MRONJ), specifically with respect to the discontinuation of bone-modifying agents, the 2019 ASCO/ISOO/MASCC guidelines indicate there is insufficient evidence to recommend for, or against discontinuation in patients diagnosed with MRONJ while on such therapy. It is advisable to consider deferring the administration of the bone-modifying agent at the discretion of the treating physician, in conjunction with a discussion with the patient and the oral health provider.

### Relationship of lesion location to postoperative steroid use in eosinophilic chronic rhinosinusitis [^116eLQcz]. The Laryngoscope (2023). High credibility.

Eosinophilic chronic rhinosinusitis (ECRS) is known to recur after surgery. The treatment choice for recurrent ECRS — such as oral steroids or biological agents — must be chosen carefully, and identifying the lesion location may be useful. This study aimed to evaluate the postoperative course of ECRS patients and assess the relationship between endoscopic lesion location and postoperative oral steroid use.

- **Methods**: Patients with chronic rhinosinusitis who underwent bilateral endoscopic sinus surgery from April 2018 to March 2020 were divided into two groups based on the presence or absence of oral steroid use after surgery. The primary endpoint was the lesion location on endoscopic findings during surgery: middle turbinate, middle meatus, superior turbinate, superior meatus, nasal septum, and sphenoethmoidal recess. Subjective symptoms, blood tests, and computerized tomography (CT) findings (Lund-Mackay score) were evaluated as secondary endpoints.

- **Results**: Among 264 patients, 88 were diagnosed histologically with ECRS (mean age 48.98 ± 1.40 years, 67 males/21 females). Twenty-three patients were steroid-using, 65 were steroid-free, and six stopped attending their appointments. Patients with sphenoethmoidal recess lesions were significantly more likely to require steroids (p = 0.019). There was a significant association between steroid use and younger age (p = 0.041), olfactory dysfunction (p = 0.021), and involvement of all sinuses (Frontal sinus: p < 0.001, Anterior ethmoid sinus: p = 0.002, Posterior ethmoid sinus: p = 0.011, Maxillary sinus: p = 0.018, Sphenoid sinus: p = 0.034).

### Eliquis [^111T1Gpc]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Ensure that all your doctors and dentists are informed that you are taking Eliquis. They should consult the doctor who prescribed Eliquis before any surgery, medical, or dental procedure.

Inform your doctor about all the medications you currently take, including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements. Some of these medications might interact with Eliquis, potentially increasing your risk of bleeding or stroke. Refer to "What is the most important information I should know about Eliquis?"

Keep an updated list of all your medications and share it with your doctor and pharmacist whenever you receive a new prescription.

- **How should I take Eliquis**: Take Eliquis exactly as prescribed by your doctor. The typical dosage involves taking Eliquis twice daily, with or without food. Do not change your dose or discontinue use without your doctor's guidance. In the event you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember, but do not double up doses to compensate for a missed dose. If swallowing the tablet whole is difficult, consult your doctor about alternative methods of administration.

Your doctor will determine the duration for which you should be on Eliquis. Discontinuing use without medical advice, especially if prescribed for atrial fibrillation, may increase your risk of stroke. Ensure that you do not run out of Eliquis; always refill your prescription ahead of time. Particularly when leaving the hospital after hip or knee replacement surgery, make certain you have an adequate supply of Eliquis to avoid missed doses.

If you suspect you've taken too much Eliquis, please contact your healthcare provider immediately.

### Zontivity [^1113fhP3]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2021). High credibility.

Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved Patient Labeling (Medication Guide).

- **Benefits and risks**: Summarize the benefits and potential side effects of Zontivity. Tell patients to take Zontivity exactly as prescribed. Inform patients not to discontinue Zontivity without discussing it with the prescribing physician. Remind patients to read the Medication Guide.

- **Bleeding**: Inform patients that they may bleed and bruise more easily. They should report any unanticipated, prolonged, or excessive bleeding, or blood in their stool or urine.

- **Invasive procedures**: Instruct patients to inform physicians and dentists that they are taking Zontivity before any surgery or dental procedure. Tell the doctor performing any surgery or dental procedure to talk to the prescribing physician before stopping Zontivity.

- **Concomitant medications**: Tell patients to list all prescription medications, over-the-counter medications, or dietary supplements they are taking or plan to take so that the physician is aware of other treatments that may affect bleeding risk.

- **Lactation**: Advise patients that breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with Zontivity.

### Effects and mechanisms of perioperative medications on the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal response to surgical injury: A narrative review [^112u8Qza]. Journal of Clinical Anesthesia (2024). Low credibility.

The adrenal gland is a vital endocrine organ, and adrenal steroid synthesis and secretion are closely regulated by the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis in response to various stimuli. Surgery or trauma can activate the HPA axis and induce the secretion of cortisol. Different cortisol responses vary with the grade of surgery. Perioperative medications have the potential to decrease the cortisol level in the body, and both excessive and insufficient cortisol levels after surgery are disadvantageous.

- **Adrenal insufficiency (AI)**: The effect of perioperative medications on the HPA response to surgery can be divided into three levels: adrenal insufficiency (AI), stress response inhibition, and uncertainty. The clinical presentation of AI includes fatigue, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, muscle cramps, hypotension, hypovolemic shock, and prerenal failure, which may result in fatal consequences.

- **Stress response inhibition**: Stress response inhibition can reduce postoperative complications, such as pain and cognitive dysfunction. This is protective to patients during perioperative and postoperative periods.

The aim of the present review is to shed light on evidence regarding the exact effects and mechanisms of perioperative medications on the HPA response to surgical injury and provide applicable guidance on clinical anesthesia.

### Do the benefits of systemic corticosteroids outweigh adverse effects during maxillofacial trauma surgery? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^112ULYSa]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2021). Low credibility.

Perioperative systemic corticosteroids are widely used in maxillofacial trauma surgery to prevent postoperative complications, but the potentially perceived benefits are speculative rather than evidence-based. The purpose of our systematic review and meta-analysis was to assess the effects of perioperative systemic corticosteroids on clinically significant outcomes in patients undergoing maxillofacial trauma surgery.

We searched Medline, Embase, CENTRAL, clinical trial registry, and grey literature, as well as references of included trials. Our primary outcomes were facial edema and pain after the surgery. Our secondary outcomes were postoperative nausea and vomiting, neurosensory disturbance, functional recovery, wound infections, and other adverse events.

Of the 94 trials retrieved, 13 were included (n = 652). Perioperative steroid use was associated with reduced pain and facial edema. We observed a decrease in postoperative nausea and vomiting with the use of systemic corticosteroids (n = 184, OR = 0.53, [0.28, 1.02], I² = 0%). Four trials reported infections and impaired wound healing associated with steroids (n = 160, OR = 3.37, [1.43, 7.94], I² = 2%). The 13 trials had an unclear risk of bias.

Systemic corticosteroids reduced facial edema and postoperative pain, but impaired wound healing was also reported. The use of systemic steroids in maxillofacial trauma surgery is thus supported only by weak evidence, and further research is advocated.

### Perioperative corticosteroids for preventing complications following facial plastic surgery [^1179Jw6f]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Early recovery is an important factor for people undergoing facial plastic surgery. However, the normal inflammatory processes that are a consequence of surgery commonly cause oedema (swelling) and ecchymosis (bruising), both undesirable complications. Severe oedema and ecchymosis delay full recovery and may lead to patient dissatisfaction with procedures. Perioperative corticosteroids have been used in facial plastic surgery with the aim of preventing oedema and ecchymosis.

- **Objectives**: To determine the effects, including safety, of perioperative administration of corticosteroids for preventing complications following facial plastic surgery in adults.

- **Search methods**: In January 2014, we searched the following electronic databases: the Cochrane Wounds Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid MEDLINE (In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations), Ovid Embase, EBSCO CINAHL, and Literatura Latino-Americana e do Caribe em Ciências da Saúde (LILACS). There were no restrictions on the basis of date or language of publication.

- **Selection criteria**: We included RCTs that compared the administration of perioperative systemic corticosteroids with another intervention, no intervention, or placebo in facial plastic surgery.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently screened the trials for inclusion in the review, appraised trial quality, and extracted data.

### Supplemental perioperative steroids for surgical patients with adrenal insufficiency [^117R1s5T]. The Cochrane database of systematic reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Adrenal crisis is a life-threatening condition that can be induced by stress during surgery in patients with adrenal insufficiency. This may be prevented by the perioperative administration of high doses of steroids. There is disagreement on whether supplemental perioperative steroids are required and, when administered, on the amount and frequency of doses.

- **Objectives**: To assess whether it is necessary to administer supplemental perioperative steroids in adult patients on maintenance doses of glucocorticoids because of adrenal insufficiency.

- **Search strategy**: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2009, Issue 1); MEDLINE (1966 to January 2009); EMBASE (1980 to January 2009); LILACS (1982 to January 2009); and the databases of ongoing trials. We handsearched the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (1982 to 1997), Clinical Endocrinology (1972 to 1997), Surgery (1948 to 1994), Annals of Surgery (1948 to 1994), and Anaesthesia (1948 to 2000).

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized controlled trials that compared the use of supplemental perioperative steroids to a placebo in adult patients on maintenance doses of steroids who required surgery.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Study authors were contacted for missing information. We used mean differences and standard deviations to summarize the data for each group.

- **Main results**: Two trials involving 37 patients were included. These studies reported that supplemental perioperative steroids…

### Prevalence and outcomes of patients taking oral corticosteroids for over 1 month undergoing major surgery in England 2010–2020 [^1138ze81]. Anaesthesia (2025). High credibility.

The inclusion criteria were: age 18 years or over at the time of the index surgery; acceptable user status registered in CPRD, registered at an up-to-standard practice and eligible for the CPRD linkage scheme; and at least 12 months of up-to-standard pre-operative follow-up. Patients with an index surgical procedure before 1 April 2010 or after 31 March 2020, and those not registered at the GP practice for at least one year before their index surgical procedure, were not studied.

Patients entered the cohort 12 months before an eligible OPCS-4 code was first recorded and were followed up until 31 March 2020, or earlier if they died or were transferred out of their primary care practice at the time of surgery. We used prescribing data from CPRD to define three sets of patients:

- **Low-dose**: Those taking ≤ 7.5 mg oral prednisolone equivalents per day for at least 28 days in the 91 days (3 months) before surgery.

- **High-dose**: Those taking > 7.5 mg oral prednisolone equivalents per day for at least 28 days in the 91 days before surgery.

The final group was a set of patients who did not fulfill either of these criteria ('no steroids'). We used 7.5 mg prednisolone equivalents per day as our threshold, as this would likely exclude almost all patients who were taking corticosteroids as replacement for absolute adrenal/pituitary deficiency (25 mg hydrocortisone — towards the top end of daily replacement dose — which is approximately equal to 6.5 mg oral prednisolone equivalents). We performed a sensitivity analysis to ensure that patients taking oral corticosteroids for less than 28 days did not influence the results significantly.

### Desowen [^112gW1Jh]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2019). Low credibility.

Systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids can lead to reversible hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression, with the potential for glucocorticosteroid insufficiency after the withdrawal of treatment. Manifestations such as Cushing's syndrome, hyperglycemia, and glucosuria can also occur in some patients due to systemic absorption while on treatment.

Patients applying a topical steroid to a large surface area or under occlusion should be periodically evaluated for evidence of HPA axis suppression. This evaluation can be conducted by using ACTH stimulation, A.M. plasma cortisol, and urinary free cortisol tests. Patients receiving superpotent corticosteroids should not be treated for more than two weeks at a time, and treatment should be limited to small areas due to the heightened risk of HPA axis suppression.

If HPA axis suppression is observed, attempts should be made to withdraw the drug, reduce the frequency of application, or substitute a less potent corticosteroid. Recovery of HPA axis function is generally prompt and complete upon discontinuation of topical corticosteroids. In rare cases, signs and symptoms of glucocorticosteroid insufficiency may occur, necessitating supplemental systemic corticosteroids. For information on systemic supplementation, see prescribing information for those products.

Pediatric patients may be more susceptible to systemic toxicity from equivalent doses due to their larger skin surface-to-body mass ratios. For further information, see precautions under pediatric use.

If irritation develops, DesOwen® Cream or Lotion should be discontinued promptly.

### Corticosteroids or cyclooxygenase 2-selective inhibitor medication for the management of pain and swelling after third-molar surgery [^112ht6Zf]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

The dental impaction pain model is the most commonly used and widely accepted acute pain model for assessing the analgesic effect of drugs in humans. This randomized crossover clinical trial aimed to observe and compare the anti-inflammatory effects of corticosteroid and nonsteroidal cyclooxygenase 2-selective inhibitor medication on pain, swelling, and trismus after third-molar surgery.

Fifty adult subjects, 25 male and 25 female, aged between 18 and 29 years (mean, 22.5 years), with bilateral impacted lower third molars in similar positions requiring surgical extraction, were selected. Each subject underwent one surgical procedure per side, with a three-week interval between procedures. They received either 120 mg etoricoxib, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory (group 1), or 4 mg dexamethasone, a corticosteroid anti-inflammatory (group 2), one hour before the procedures.

Data were recorded at preoperative baseline and 24 and 48 hours postoperatively. Postoperative pain was evaluated using a visual analog scale, and the degree of swelling was assessed through variation in facial reference points. Trismus was analyzed by measuring the interincisal distance. These assessments were conducted before the operation and at 24 and 48 hours following the surgeries.

There was no statistically significant difference between the anti-inflammatory treatments. However, at 48 hours, facial swelling increased in both groups despite a reduction in trismus.

### Perioperative systemic corticosteroids in orthognathic surgery: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^1163UAxy]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Perioperative systemic corticosteroids are broadly used in orthognathic surgery to prevent postoperative complications, but it is unclear whether this practice is beneficial, and concerns about potential side effects have been raised. The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to assess the effects of perioperative systemic corticosteroids on clinically important outcomes in patients undergoing orthognathic surgery.

- **Materials and methods**: The authors conducted a systematic review of randomized controlled trials evaluating the effect of systemic corticosteroids in orthognathic surgery compared with placebo or any other intervention. They searched Medline, Embase, Cochrane Central, CINAHL, Lilacs, Scopus, and Web of Science, as well as references of included trials. The primary outcome was the incidence of postoperative reintubation during the index hospitalization. Secondary outcomes included hospital length of stay, decreases in facial edema, and adverse events. Data were summarized using Mantel-Haenszel random-effects models.

- **Results**: Of the 1,098 trials retrieved, 8 were included (n = 234). No trial evaluated the risk of postoperative reintubation. One trial evaluated the duration of hospital stay and showed no difference associated with the intervention. There was a decrease in facial edema with the use of systemic corticosteroids (n = 80; standardized mean difference, -1.07; 95% confidence interval, -1.99 to -0.16; I² = 67%). Three trials reported side effects such as postoperative surgical site bleeding, hypersensitivity, and stomach discomfort.

### Small cell lung cancer, Version 2.2022, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^116AU78y]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2021). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for small cell lung cancer, specifically with respect to the management of extensive-stage disease (primary treatment), the NCCN 2021 guidelines recommend initiating steroids for patients with symptomatic neurologic disease. This includes administering a dexamethasone 10 mg loading dose followed by a 4–6 mg maintenance dose IV or PO every 4–6 hours, or as appropriate.

### Low-dose steroid therapy at an early phase of postoperative acute respiratory distress syndrome [^112ZGrGj]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

The acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) that develops after thoracic surgery is usually lethal. The use of corticosteroids to treat ARDS has been the subject of great controversy.

- **Methods**: Therefore, we compared conventional therapy with early low-dose steroid therapy in the treatment of postoperative ARDS. Methylprednisolone was given daily as an intravenous push every 6 hours and was changed to a single oral dose or discontinued, with a loading dose of 2 mg/kg followed by 2 mg/kg per day.

- **Results**: Over 2.5 years, 523 major thoracic operations were performed with postoperative ARDS developing in 20 patients (3.8%), of which 8 were treated with conventional therapy and 12 with early low-dose steroid therapy. Early low-dose steroid therapy significantly reduced postoperative mortality, with 7 patients (58.3%) recovering without mechanical ventilation.

- **Conclusions**: We believe this is the first clinical study of low-dose methylprednisolone at an early phase of postoperative ARDS. The beneficial effects of the use of early low-dose steroids in ARDS are consistent with the hypothesis that fibroproliferation is an early response to lung injury, which is inhibited by early low-dose steroid therapy without disturbing operative wound healing.

### The impact of prior use of corticosteroid to dental extraction on oral health-related quality-of-life and clinical outcomes: A randomized clinical trial [^112oD7gP]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2020). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of prior use of corticosteroids before dental extractions on oral health-related quality-of-life (OHRQoL).

A randomized and triple-blind (patient, surgeon, and examiner) clinical trial was designed. The individuals were randomly allocated into two groups: test and placebo. In the test group, two capsules of 4 mg dexamethasone were administered orally. In the placebo group, subjects received two capsules with the same characteristics. In both groups, the administration took place one hour before the procedure. OHRQoL was assessed by the Brazilian version of the Oral Health Impact Profile 14 (OHIP-14). The OHIP-14 questionnaire and the assessment methods for clinical parameters were collected preoperatively and postoperatively. Multilevel linear regression models fitted the associations between preoperative use of corticosteroids and overall and domain-specific OHIP-14 scores over time.

One hundred fourteen patients were selected for the study; however, 21 were excluded for not returning to postoperative control on the seventh day, resulting in 93 patients assessed (test: 44 and placebo: 49). Pain had a negative impact on OHRQoL (P < .01); however, the use of the drug had no statistically significant influence on OHRQoL (P = 0.62) and the clinical outcomes of pain (P = 0.63), mouth aperture (P = 0.05), and edema (P = 0.69).

In conclusion, the use of 8 mg dexamethasone administered orally before the procedure was not effective in the improvement of the quality-of-life of patients undergoing dental extraction. However, using the medication…

### Prevalence and outcomes of patients taking oral corticosteroids for over 1 month undergoing major surgery in England 2010–2020 [^111AUceV]. Anaesthesia (2025). High credibility.

We included major surgery in this dataset and thus do not know the proportion of patients presenting for all severities of surgery. Our research question aimed to describe the characteristics of patients taking corticosteroids for inflammatory reasons who may need supplementing during the peri-operative period, the procedures they were undergoing, and their outcomes. However, since the probability of adrenal crisis after minor surgery in those at risk of tertiary hypoadrenalism is low, their inclusion would not have been useful in answering the question. This cohort also does not include patients having caesarean sections or those in labor. Maternity admissions in this cohort comprised patients who were, or recently were, pregnant and had major surgery.

Another weakness is that patients will continue to contribute to the denominator (the population) without contributing to the numerator (number of primary care interactions/readmissions) because we could not censor patients from follow-up outcomes (e.g. hospital admission, primary care interactions) after they had died. This is a potential explanation for the fewer primary care interactions in the high-dose group.

There may have been some changes in care for following up patients having surgery during 2019–2020 due to the effects of COVID-19 on healthcare provision after early 2020. The effects of these on 30-day outcomes are likely to be small, and our analysis showed no difference in the 1-year outcomes when patients having their index surgery during this period were omitted. Previous work has shown that around 1% of…

### Erythematous pustules and plaques following a dental procedure [^116e9SbJ]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Low credibility.

- **Question 2**: What is the most appropriate treatment in this scenario?
	- A. Hydrocortisone 2.5% ointment
	- B. Prednisone
	- C. Amoxicillin-clavulanate
	- D. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX)
	- E. Ursodeoxycholic acid

- **Answers**:
	- A. Hydrocortisone 2.5% ointment – Incorrect. This would be used in an inflammatory condition of pregnancy, such as an atopic eruption.
	- B. Prednisone – Incorrect. Systemic corticosteroids can be used to treat pemphigoid gestationis, a rare bullous dermatosis related to pregnancy.
	- C. Amoxicillin-clavulanate – Correct. Most Actinomyces infections are sensitive to beta-lactams, and the treatment of choice is a prolonged course of amoxicillin-clavulanate. Intravenous preparations can be used in severe cases. Alternatives to amoxicillin-clavulanate include clindamycin, macrolides, and doxycycline. Additionally, if dental caries or abscess are the cause of the infection, dental treatment with extraction of the tooth is necessary. Surgical management may be required for draining abscesses or debridement of necrotic bone tissue if the infection progresses to osteomyelitis. The patient presented in this case was treated with a 6-month course of amoxicillin-clavulanate and underwent extraction of the right first upper molar. The patient demonstrated interval improvement in symptoms at follow-up visits.
	- D. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) – Incorrect. TMP-SMX can be used to treat bacterial infections such as nocardiosis. It is typically avoided during the first trimester of pregnancy.
	- E. Ursodeoxycholic acid – Incorrect. Ursodeoxycholic acid is a bile acid that is not applicable in this context.

### The influence of bolus of methylprednisolone on postorthognathic surgery symptoms: A controlled clinical trial [^1118A5nW]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2023).

Despite improvements in maxillary and mandibular osteotomy, complications still result in approximately 20% of cases. Standard postoperative and intraoperative therapies, based on the use of betamethasone and tranexamic acid, could help to minimize the onset of side effects. The aim of the study was to compare the role of a supplementary bolus of methylprednisolone, rather than standard therapy, in the onset of postoperative symptoms.

- **Methods**: The study enrolled 10 patients affected by class 2 and 3 dentoskeletal malocclusions, who were submitted to the institution for maxillomandibular repositioning osteotomy between October 2020 and April 2021. Patients were divided into two groups: 5 patients (Group A) received standard therapy consisting of the administration of 4 mg of betamethasone intraoperatively and 1 g of tranexamic acid in two administrations. The remaining 5 patients (Group B) received a supplementary bolus of 20 mg methylprednisolone before the end of surgery. All patients received 4 mg of betamethasone every 12 hours for 3 days in the postoperative period. Postoperative outcomes were evaluated using a questionnaire that assessed speaking discomfort, pain when swallowing, feeding discomfort, drinking discomfort, swelling, and ache. Each parameter was associated with a numeric rating scale ranging from 0 to 5.

- **Results**: The authors observed that patients treated with a supplementary bolus of methylprednisolone (Group B) had a statistically significant reduction in all postoperative symptoms compared to patients in Group A (✱ p < 0.05, ✱✱ p < 0.01).

### A survey of the use of perioperative glucocorticoids in oral and maxillofacial surgery [^116FQQoF]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

The aim of the study was to clarify the use of perioperative glucocorticoids (GCs) in association with oral and maxillofacial surgical procedures. We conducted a survey of consultant oral and maxillofacial surgeons (OMSs) working in tertiary and secondary referral hospitals in Finland.

The administration of GCs is common among OMSs (85.2% of respondents), especially in association with orthognathic surgery (100% of respondents) and facial fractures (43.5%). All OMSs who administered GCs reported that they reduce swelling. The next most common reasons for administering GCs were established practice (43.5%) and pain reduction (39.1%). The regimens differed widely from a 5-mg single dose to a 116-mg total dose of dexamethasone equivalent.

GCs are widely administered by OMSs, especially in major surgery. The literature shows some benefits of their use in dental and orthognathic operations, and their use seems rather safe. Proof of efficacy remains to be determined for other major maxillofacial surgical procedures; thus, further studies are needed.

### European Society of Endocrinology and Endocrine Society joint clinical guideline: Diagnosis and therapy of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency [^1142FRtj]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

The overall duration, type, and daily dose of glucocorticoid used should be considered when designing a glucocorticoid taper. Patients treated with higher glucocorticoid doses, long-acting glucocorticoids, and for a longer duration are likely to have more glucocorticoid withdrawal symptoms. Patients with features of exogenous Cushing syndrome are more likely to have a challenging glucocorticoid taper course because of glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome.

A slow decrease in glucocorticoid dose is the only known intervention that may help prevent severe glucocorticoid withdrawal symptoms. In patients following curative surgery for endogenous hypercortisolism, the baseline clinical severity score was associated with the severity of glucocorticoid withdrawal. Symptoms worsened once the total daily glucocorticoid dose reached below 30 to 35 mg of hydrocortisone equivalent (e.g. 7.5 mg prednisone). Clinical severity was calculated based on the presence of physical features and comorbidities potentially related to glucocorticoid excess. This method may also be applied in patients treated with supraphysiologic glucocorticoids when deciding on the rapidity of glucocorticoid taper. Slower tapering is advised for patients with a high clinical severity score, whereas a more rapid taper is suitable for those with a lower clinical severity score.

In patients experiencing severe glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome despite a slower taper, increasing the glucocorticoid dose temporarily may be necessary.

### Postoperative systemic inflammatory dysregulation and corticosteroids: a narrative review [^11287UGA]. Anaesthesia (2023). Low credibility.

Given the apparent safety of peri-operative corticosteroids and appreciating the consistent signals of potential benefit, future research designs need to be further refined so that meaningful outcomes can be achieved. For this, several key elements, mainly revolving around administration regimens and patient selection, need to be further addressed.

Good quality evidence around the optimal dosing of corticosteroids in the peri-operative setting is still sparse. Doses in most trials have been based on contemporary practice of either a single 4–8 mg dose of dexamethasone for PONV prophylaxis, or much higher doses for inflammatory prophylaxis in major surgery. Although there is some evidence indicating a dose–response effect of intra-operative dexamethasone (0.05–0.1 mg/kg) on quality of recovery and analgesia‐related outcomes, the relationships between corticosteroid dosing regimens and inflammation‐related outcomes are not well-defined.

In recent large cardiac surgery trials, the high dosing regimen was pragmatically chosen based on long-standing practices where dexamethasone doses of up to 1 mg/kg (or methylprednisolone 10–30 mg/kg) were routinely used. The dose of methylprednisolone used in the SIRS trial (2 x 250 mg intra-operatively) was chosen more conservatively based on meta-analysis evidence suggesting that higher doses might be associated with prolonged postoperative ventilation. Interestingly, more recent data suggest that high doses could in fact have a mode of action that has a different balance of genomic and non-genomic effects.

### European Society of Endocrinology and Endocrine Society joint clinical guideline: Diagnosis and therapy of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency [^113RVW44]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

As discussed in sections R1.2, R1.3, and R3.2, patients need to be educated on stress dosing of glucocorticoids aiming to prevent adrenal crises and their negative sequelae. Potential adrenal insufficiency and the need for stress dosing should be considered even after discontinuation of glucocorticoid therapy and replacement, particularly in those patients who had not undergone biochemical testing to confirm the recovery of the HPA-axis. Based on a retrospective analysis, mortality is increased particularly in the immediate period following the cessation of glucocorticoid therapy. Therefore, patients with recent glucocorticoid use who did not undergo biochemical testing to rule out glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency and are under minor stress (e.g. fever, infection requiring antibiotics, physical trauma, significant emotional stress) not leading to hemodynamic instability and with no evidence of oral glucocorticoid malabsorption (vomiting, diarrhea) or who are undergoing a surgical procedure under local anesthesia will require coverage with a stress dose of oral glucocorticoids. The recommended stress dose of hydrocortisone is the same as for patients with primary or secondary adrenal insufficiency of other etiology: patients should receive double the physiologic replacement dose, i.e. hydrocortisone 40 mg daily, usually split into three doses — 20 mg on rising, 10 mg at midday, 10 mg at 5 pm. In patients using other glucocorticoid formulations, a dose equivalent to 40 mg hydrocortisone is suggested.

### Cortifoam [^115Nabv5]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The lowest possible dose of corticosteroid should be used to control the condition under treatment. When reduction in dosage is possible, the reduction should be gradual. Since complications of treatment with glucocorticoids are dependent on the size of the dose and the duration of treatment, a risk/benefit decision must be made in each individual case regarding the dose and duration of treatment, as well as whether daily or intermittent therapy should be used.

Kaposi's sarcoma has been reported to occur in patients receiving corticosteroid therapy, most often for chronic conditions. Discontinuation of corticosteroids may result in clinical improvement.

- **Cardio-renal**: As sodium retention with resultant edema and potassium loss may occur in patients receiving corticosteroids, these agents should be used with caution in patients with congestive heart failure, hypertension, or renal insufficiency.

- **Endocrine**: Drug-induced secondary adrenocortical insufficiency may be minimized by gradual reduction of dosage. This type of relative insufficiency may persist for months after discontinuation of therapy; therefore, in any stressful situation occurring during that period, hormone therapy should be reinstituted. Since mineralocorticoid secretion may be impaired, salt and/or a mineralocorticoid should be administered concurrently.

- **Gastrointestinal**: Steroids should be used with caution in patients with active or latent peptic ulcers, diverticulitis, fresh intestinal anastomoses, and nonspecific ulcerative colitis, as they may increase the risk of perforation. When surgery is imminent, it is critical to consider these risks in patient management.

### Dexamethasone sodium phosphate [^112oBsER]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Indications**: Dexamethasone sodium phosphate is administered intravenously or intramuscularly when oral therapy is not feasible, and the strength, dosage form, and route of administration permit treatment of the condition. Products labeled for such use are indicated as follows:

	- **Endocrine disorders**: Used for primary or secondary adrenocortical insufficiency. Hydrocortisone or cortisone is preferred; synthetic analogs may be used with mineralocorticoids as applicable, especially in infancy, where mineralocorticoid supplementation is crucial. It is also indicated for acute adrenocortical insufficiency, where supplementation with mineralocorticoids might be necessary, particularly when synthetic analogs are involved. Additionally, it can be used preoperatively and in cases of serious trauma or illness in patients with known adrenal insufficiency or doubts regarding adrenocortical reserve. It is also applicable for shock unresponsive to conventional therapy if adrenocortical insufficiency is present or suspected. Other uses include treatment for congenital adrenal hyperplasia, nonsuppurative thyroiditis, and hypercalcemia associated with cancer.

	- **Rheumatic disorders**: Acts as adjunctive therapy for short-term administration during acute episodes or exacerbations of conditions such as post-traumatic osteoarthritis, synovitis of osteoarthritis, and rheumatoid arthritis, including juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (with selected cases possibly requiring low-dose maintenance therapy).

### Pre-cardiac dental treatment does not increase the risk of adverse events [^114MijSf]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2022). Low credibility.

The elimination of dental sources of infection prior to cardiovascular surgery (CVS) is performed to reduce perioperative infection and complications. This study aims to evaluate if preoperative dental intervention is associated with an increased risk of adverse events.

- **Methods**: A retrospective medical record review of inpatient consultations (n = 1513) completed by the Hospital Dentistry Service at the University of California, Los Angeles Medical Center from January 2011 to December 2020 was performed. Seven hundred thirty-eight consults met the inclusion criteria and were divided into four groups:
	- Group A comprised patients that were dentally unhealthy and received surgical dental intervention (n = 265).
	- Group B comprised patients that were dentally unhealthy and underwent non-surgical dental treatment (n = 14).
	- Group C comprised patients that were dentally unhealthy and did not receive the recommended dental treatment (n = 29).
	- Group D comprised patients that were dentally healthy, requiring no intervention (n = 430). They were evaluated for major adverse events in three categories: dental complications, medical adverse events, and death.

- **Results**: Dental complications were only experienced in Group A, all of which were bleeding. Only two patients were found to have major bleeding, which was more likely due to anticoagulation and CVS rather than dental extractions. There was no significant difference in the number of medical adverse events or number of deaths during the postoperative period between groups.

- **Conclusions**: The results of this study suggest that the elimination of oral infection prior to CVS does not increase the risk of adverse events.

### Do antiplatelet drugs increase the risk of bleeding after dental implant surgery? A case-and-crossover study [^115khwyP]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Cessation versus continuation of antiplatelet drugs in patients undergoing dental implant surgery is a controversial issue. This study evaluated postoperative bleeding during and after dental implant surgery in patients taking aspirin (ASA) or clopidogrel.

- **Material and methods**: This case-and-crossover study included patients using antiplatelet drugs and receiving two bilateral dental implants in the posterior region of the mandible. During session 1, dental implants were placed without stopping antiplatelet drugs. During session 2, antiplatelet drugs were stopped for five days. In group 1, platelet activity was measured by an assay based on flow cytometry, representing the platelet reactivity index. In group 2, platelet function analysis was used to monitor the antiplatelet effect of ASA. Bleeding severity was assessed using a visual analog scale for 72 hours after dental implant placement during sessions 1 and 2. The use of antiplatelet drugs was the predictive factor, with bleeding severity and platelet function as the outcomes.

- **Results**: Group 1 consisted of 22 patients on clopidogrel 75 mg, and group 2 had 20 patients on ASA 80 mg. In group 1, bleeding severity was 4.86 ± 0.77 during session 1 and 4.59 ± 0.66 during session 2. Data analysis showed no difference in bleeding severity between sessions in group 1 (P = 0.72). For group 2, bleeding severity was 4.05 ± 0.94 during session 1 and 3.9 ± 0.85 during session 2. No difference was found in bleeding severity between sessions.

### Optimum management of glucocorticoid-treated patients [^114facbA]. Nature Clinical Practice. Endocrinology & Metabolism (2008). Low credibility.

Glucocorticoids are taken by approximately 2% of the US adult population at any given time. The powerful anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive benefits of these drugs must, however, be weighed against their multisystem adverse effects. Clinicians should always prescribe the lowest possible dose for the shortest possible time. Patients should be informed of the short-term and long-term adverse effects to expect, particularly if the dose of glucocorticoids is expected to exceed the equivalent of approximately 7.5 mg prednisone daily for 2 months or more.

At the commencement of glucocorticoid therapy, a patient's blood pressure, lipid profile, 25-hydroxyvitamin D(3) level, and fasting glucose level should be measured, and baseline bone densitometry performed. Bisphosphonate therapy should be initiated for postmenopausal women and men with a bone density T-score below -1 or for those with a history of fracture. Regular ophthalmic screening for cataracts and glaucoma is warranted, and patients at high risk of gastric ulceration (especially those simultaneously taking nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) should receive proton-pump inhibitors. Prophylaxis against opportunistic infections is appropriate for high-risk populations, such as organ-transplant recipients. Trimethoprim plus sulfamethoxazole can be given to high-risk populations, such as organ transplant recipients. The duration of weaning from glucocorticoid treatment should be proportionate to treatment duration. Appropriate preventive therapy can mitigate many of the adverse effects associated with glucocorticoid therapy.

### Corticosteroids reduce postoperative morbidity after third molar surgery: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^116Sq35o]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to apply meta-analytical methods to measure the effect of corticosteroids (CS) on edema, trismus, and pain during early and late postoperative periods following third molar (M3) removal.

A systematic search of the literature was conducted to identify eligible articles. The primary predictor variable was perioperative CS exposure (yes or no). The three outcome variables were edema, trismus, and pain, assessed during the early (1–3 days) and late (> 3 days) postoperative periods. Standardized mean differences (SMD) for edema and weighted mean differences (WMD) for trismus and pain were pooled across studies. Differences between the two treatment groups were assessed using random effects models and metaregressions for both early and late postoperative assessments.

Twelve trials met the inclusion criteria. Subjects receiving CS had significantly less edema during both early (SMD, 1.4; 95% confidence interval, 0.6, 2.2; P < .001) and late (SMD, 1.1; 95% CI, 0.1, 2.0; p = 0.03) periods after surgery and experienced less trismus than controls during the early and late postoperative periods (early WMD, 4.1 mm; 95% CI, 2.8 mm, 5.5 mm; P < .001; late WMD, 2.7 mm; 95% CI, 0.8 mm, 4.6 mm; p = 0.005). Average pain levels were not significantly different between the two groups (early WMD, 0.4 visual analog scale [VAS]; 95% CI, -0.04 VAS, 0.9 VAS; p = 0.07; late WMD, 0.5 VAS; 95% CI, -0.6 VAS, 1.5 VAS; p = 0.4).

The findings of this study suggest that perioperative administration of corticosteroids produces a mild to moderate reduction in postoperative morbidity.

Regarding perioperative care for medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw, particularly in the context of perioperative planning for elective dentoalveolar surgery, the 2019 ASCO/ISOO/MASCC guidelines indicate there is insufficient evidence to make a definitive recommendation for, or against the discontinuation of bone-modifying agent therapy before such surgeries in patients with cancer receiving a bone-modifying agent at an oncologic dose. It is advised to consider deferring the administration of bone-modifying agents at the discretion of the treating physician. This decision should be made in conjunction with a discussion involving the patient and the oral health provider.

### The impact of intravenous corticosteroids with third molar surgery in patients at high risk for delayed health-related quality of life and clinical recovery [^1124t1ay]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

To compare recovery for clinical and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) outcomes after third molar surgery, patients predicted to be at risk for delayed recovery were treated with or without intravenous (IV) corticosteroids at surgery.

- **Patients and methods**: Patients at least 18 years of age with all four third molars below the occlusal plane were given IV corticosteroids just before surgery. Clinical and HRQOL outcomes of these patients were compared with those of a control group who did not receive corticosteroids. No antibiotics were administered. The control group was selected using the same criteria and treated under the same surgical protocol as the corticosteroid group. Differences between the groups were assessed with Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel row mean score statistics.

- **Results**: Sixty patients were in each cohort. The incidence of delayed clinical recovery, indicated by a postsurgery visit with treatment, was higher in the control group compared with the corticosteroid group. In the corticosteroid group, 6 patients (10%) had one postsurgery visit with treatment. In the control group without corticosteroids, 17 patients (28%) had at least one postsurgery visit with treatment (P = 0.01). Compared with the control group, nausea tended to bother patients less on postsurgery day 1 (P = 0.07); sleep was improved on postsurgery days 1 through 4 (P < .05). Though not statistically significant, corticosteroids reduced the patients' reported recovery time by at least one day for pain, lifestyle, and oral function.

### Recommendations for the diagnosis and management of corticosteroid insufficiency in critically ill adult patients: Consensus statements from an international task force by the American College of Critical Care Medicine [^1177twrz]. Critical Care Medicine (2008). High credibility.

To develop consensus statements for the diagnosis and management of corticosteroid insufficiency in critically ill adult patients, a multidisciplinary, multispecialty task force of experts in critical care medicine was convened. Members were drawn from the Society of Critical Care Medicine and the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine. Additionally, international experts in endocrinology participated.

The task force reviewed published literature and provided expert opinion to derive consensus statements using a modified Delphi methodology. The strength of each recommendation was quantified using the Modified GRADE system, classifying recommendations as strong (grade 1) or weak (grade 2) and the quality of evidence as high (grade A), moderate (grade B), or low (grade C). These classifications were based on study design, consistency of results, and directness of evidence.

The task force introduced the term "critical illness-related corticosteroid insufficiency" (CIRCI) to describe dysfunction of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis during critical illness. CIRCI is caused by adrenal insufficiency combined with tissue corticosteroid resistance and is characterized by an exaggerated and protracted proinflammatory response. CIRCI should be suspected in hypotensive patients who have responded poorly to fluids and vasopressor agents.

### Prevalence and outcomes of patients taking oral corticosteroids for over 1 month undergoing major surgery in England 2010–2020 [^115pP6mQ]. Anaesthesia (2025). Low credibility.

Approximately 1% of the UK population is prescribed oral corticosteroids at any one time. It is not known how many of these patients present for major surgery. We aimed to establish the prevalence, characteristics, and outcomes of patients taking oral corticosteroids.

- **Methods**: We identified patients aged > 18 years undergoing major surgery between 1 April 2010 and 31 March 2020 from Hospital Episode Statistics, linked with Clinical Practice Research Datalink data, and the Office for National Statistics Mortality register in England. Prescribing data were used to define three sets of patients: 'low-dose' - taking ≤ 7.5 mg oral prednisolone equivalents per day for at least 28/91 days before surgery; 'high-dose' - taking > 7.5 mg oral prednisolone equivalents per day for at least 28/91 days before surgery; and a 'no-steroids' group. We used ≤ 7.5 mg of prednisolone equivalents per day as our threshold, as this would likely exclude almost all patients who were taking corticosteroids as replacement for absolute adrenal/pituitary deficiency.

- **Results**: We identified 1,999,326 adult patients for inclusion in the dataset: 1,929,291 (96.5%) in the no-steroids group; 63,353 (3.2%) in the low-dose group; and 6,682 (0.3%) in the high-dose group. The median (IQR [range]) duration of hospital stay increased with increasing dose of corticosteroid (no-steroid 3 (0–14 [0–14,739]); low-dose 5 (1–26 [1–8079]); and high-dose 7 (2–28 [0–6956]) days). Mortality after the index surgery was 1.5%, 3.8%, and 8.9% at 30 days, and 5.5%, 11.6%, and 39.9% at 1 year for no-steroids, low-dose, and high-dose groups, respectively.

### Solu-medrol [^113fD9UZ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

In general, high-dose corticosteroid therapy should be continued only until the patient's condition has stabilized, usually not beyond 48 to 72 hours.

In other indications, initial dosage will vary from 10 to 40 mg of methylprednisolone, depending on the specific disease entity being treated. However, in certain overwhelming, acute, life-threatening situations, administrations in dosages exceeding the usual dosages may be justified and may be in multiples of the oral dosages.

Dosage requirements are variable and must be individualized based on the disease under treatment and the patient's response. After a favorable response is noted, the proper maintenance dosage should be determined by decreasing the initial drug dosage in small decrements at appropriate time intervals until the lowest dosage that will maintain an adequate clinical response is reached. Situations that may make dosage adjustments necessary include changes in clinical status secondary to remissions or exacerbations in the disease process, the patient's individual drug responsiveness, and the effect of patient exposure to stressful situations not directly related to the disease entity under treatment. In this latter situation, it may be necessary to increase the dosage of the corticosteroid for a period consistent with the patient's condition. If, after long-term therapy, the drug is to be stopped, it is recommended that it be withdrawn gradually rather than abruptly.

### Perioperative corticosteroid management for patients with inflammatory bowel disease [^116iyb7d]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Guidelines on the appropriate use of perioperative steroids in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are lacking. As a result, corticosteroid supplementation during and after colorectal surgery procedures has been shown to be highly variable. A clearer understanding of the indications for perioperative corticosteroid administration relative to preoperative corticosteroid dosing and duration of therapy is essential. In this review, we outline the basic tenets of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and its normal response to stress, describe how corticosteroid use is thought to affect this system, and provide an overview of the currently available data on perioperative corticosteroid supplementation, including the limited evidence pertaining to patients with inflammatory bowel disease.

- **Overview of adrenal suppression and management**: Based on currently existing data, we define "adrenal suppression", and propose a patient-based approach to perioperative corticosteroid management in the inflammatory bowel disease population. This approach is based on an individual's historical use of corticosteroids, the type of surgery they are undergoing, and HPA axis testing when applicable. Patients without adrenal suppression (taking 20 mg prednisone per day) should be treated with additional perioperative corticosteroid coverage above their baseline home regimen. Patients with unclear HPA axis function (taking more than 5 mg but less than 20 mg prednisone per day) should undergo preoperative HPA axis testing to determine the best course of action for perioperative management.

### WSES-AAST guidelines: management of inflammatory bowel disease in the emergency setting [^1169M7nV]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2021). High credibility.

Regarding perioperative care for Crohn's disease, specifically in relation to the preoperative management of medications, AAST/WSES 2021 guidelines recommend weaning off corticosteroids preoperatively, ideally four weeks before surgery, and stopping anti-TNFs as soon as possible before surgery. This approach aims to decrease the risk of postoperative complications and should be done in accordance with a gastroenterologist.

### Prevalence and outcomes of patients taking oral corticosteroids for over 1 month undergoing major surgery in England 2010–2020 [^115tuReg]. Anaesthesia (2025). Low credibility.

The implications of this research for clinicians are that patients within the surgical care pathway who are taking oral corticosteroids for more than 1 month before their surgery should be highlighted as high-risk. Shared decision-making should be implemented so that patients and practitioners embark on the surgery aware of each other's wants and expectations. Given the high prevalence of patients taking oral corticosteroids, funding bodies should consider supporting studies that seek to understand why the clinical outcomes in this patient group are so poor and then move to large-scale pragmatic trials of interventions that seek to improve those outcomes.

In conclusion, this cohort study has shown that around 1 in 29 patients (3.5%) undergoing major surgery in England are taking oral corticosteroids for more than 1 month. Patients taking oral corticosteroids have a significantly increased risk of mortality and morbidity in the short and mid-term after major surgery.

### Dexamethasone sodium phosphate [^113Uzw12]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Precautions**: Drug-induced secondary adrenocortical insufficiency may be minimized by gradual reduction of dosage. This type of relative insufficiency may persist for months after discontinuation of therapy; therefore, in any situation of stress occurring during that period, hormone therapy should be reinstituted. Since mineralocorticoid secretion may be impaired, salt and/or a mineralocorticoid should be administered concurrently.

There is an enhanced effect of corticosteroids in patients with hypothyroidism and in those with cirrhosis.

Corticosteroids should be used cautiously in patients with ocular herpes simplex for fear of corneal perforation. The lowest possible dose of corticosteroid should be used to control the condition under treatment, and when reduction in dosage is possible, the reduction must be gradual.

Psychic derangements may appear when corticosteroids are used, ranging from euphoria, insomnia, mood swings, personality changes, and severe depression to frank psychotic manifestations. Additionally, existing emotional instability or psychotic tendencies may be aggravated by corticosteroids.

Aspirin should be used cautiously in conjunction with corticosteroids in hypoprothrombinemia. Steroids should be used with caution in nonspecific ulcerative colitis if there is a probability of impending perforation, abscess, or other pyogenic infection; also in diverticulitis, fresh intestinal anastomoses, active or latent peptic ulcer, renal insufficiency, hypertension, osteoporosis, and myasthenia gravis.

### Small cell lung cancer, version 2.2022, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^113E2uMo]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2021). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for small cell lung cancer (SCLC), specifically in the context of managing extensive-stage disease, the NCCN 2021 guidelines recommend the initiation of steroids for patients experiencing spinal cord compression. Systemic therapy combined with radiation therapy, typically administered sequentially, should be offered to these patients. In cases where neurologic symptoms are present, radiation therapy should be performed before systemic therapy. However, if radiation therapy cannot be commenced promptly, or if controlling systemic symptoms is a more urgent priority, it is advisable to consider starting systemic therapy first.

### Intravenous and local steroid use in the management of dysphagia after anterior cervical spine surgery: a systematic review of prospective randomized controlled trials (RCTs) [^111G36fQ]. European Spine Journal (2019). High credibility.

To conduct a high-level systematic review of the literature, a comprehensive evaluation was performed on intravenous and local steroid use in the management of dysphagia following anterior cervical spine surgery.

- **Methods**: The databases PubMed, EMBASE, Clinical Key, the Cochrane Library, and Wiley Online Library were searched without time restriction. The search terms included 'dysphagia', 'odynophagia', 'swallowing disorder', 'steroid', and 'anterior cervical spine surgery'. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were selected, and the effects of intravenous and local steroids were investigated from these studies.

- **Results**: The initial search yielded 67 citations. Six studies met the inclusion and exclusion criteria, all of which were prospective RCTs evaluated as level 1 evidence. One study found that perioperative intravenous steroid use is not effective in reducing the severity of early postoperative dysphagia after one-level ACDF, while five studies suggested that perioperative intravenous and local steroid use seemed more effective in reducing the incidence and severity of early dysphagia after multilevel ACSS. One double-blinded study found that locally administered depomedrol on a collagen sponge significantly decreases early dysphagia incidence and severity after ACSS using low-dose BMP.

- **Conclusions**: Perioperative intravenous and local steroid use could reduce the incidence and severity of early dysphagia after ACSS postoperatively, especially for multilevel surgeries. For patients undergoing revision surgery or at high risk for pseudarthrosis who need to use BMP during surgery, local administration may be particularly beneficial.

### Fludrocortisone acetate [^111REKN4]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2019). Low credibility.

Adverse reactions to corticosteroids may be produced by too rapid withdrawal or by continued use of large doses. To avoid drug-induced adrenal insufficiency, supportive dosage may be required in times of stress (such as trauma, surgery, or severe illness), both during treatment with fludrocortisone acetate and for a year afterwards.

There is an enhanced corticosteroid effect in patients with hypothyroidism and in those with cirrhosis. Corticosteroids should be used cautiously in patients with ocular herpes simplex because of possible corneal perforation. The lowest possible dose of corticosteroid should be used to control the condition being treated. A gradual reduction in dosage should be made when possible.

Psychic derangement may appear when corticosteroids are used. These may range from euphoria, insomnia, mood swings, personality changes, and severe depression to frank psychotic manifestations. Existing emotional instability or psychotic tendencies may also be aggravated by corticosteroids.

Aspirin should be used cautiously in conjunction with corticosteroids in patients with hypoprothrombinemia. Corticosteroids should be used with caution in patients with nonspecific ulcerative colitis if there is a probability of impending perforation, abscess, or other pyogenic infection.

Corticosteroids should also be used cautiously in patients with diverticulitis, fresh intestinal anastomoses, active or latent peptic ulcer, renal insufficiency, hypertension, osteoporosis, and myasthenia gravis.

### Can preoperative intramuscular single-dose dexamethasone improve patient-centered outcomes following third molar surgery [^116xV1oV]? Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2017). High credibility.

The increasing focus on administering dexamethasone to manage third molar surgical complications motivated this study, which investigated the efficacy of single-dose dexamethasone in managing postoperative complications after impacted third molar surgery. Evaluated factors included pain intensity, analgesic intake, patient discomfort, and limitations in oral function and daily activities.

This triple-blinded, split-mouth randomized controlled clinical trial involved patients aged 18 to 30 years who underwent randomized bilateral extractions of impacted mandibular third molars across two consecutive sessions. Each patient received a single-dose intramuscular injection of dexamethasone (0.1 mg/kg) preoperatively during one session and a placebo during the other. Data were collected daily for seven postoperative days, assessing 14 patient-centered outcomes. A two-tailed P-value of less than .05 was considered statistically significant.

All 32 patients (100%) completed the study. Those who received dexamethasone reported less pain (P ≤ .007), reduced analgesic intake (P ≤ .002), decreased swelling (P ≤ .007), and experienced fewer difficulties in eating (P ≤ .024), enjoying food (P ≤ .005), and speaking (P = 0.043). Additionally, they exhibited less trismus (P = 0.005), fewer absences from school or work (P ≤ .016), and reduced disruption of daily activities (P ≤ .042). The differences in bleeding, malaise, and sleep disturbance between the two conditions were not statistically significant (P > .05).
