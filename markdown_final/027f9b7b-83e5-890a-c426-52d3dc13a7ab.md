Aki work up

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the diagnostic workup for acute kidney injury. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and staging using KDIGO criteria. Then, I should verify the initial clinical assessment priorities, including history, exam, and risk stratification. Next, I will review core laboratory and urinalysis interpretation. After that, I need to check imaging indications, especially renal ultrasound. Then, I will consider advanced diagnostics for specific etiologies and the role of novel biomarkers. Finally, I should confirm follow-up planning, including 3‑month CKD assessment and documentation requirements, and I will double-check areas of controversy and correct any missteps as I go along.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and stage AKI using KDIGO criteria, because everything downstream depends on getting this right. AKI is present with an increase in serum creatinine by at least 0.3 mg/dL within 48 hours, an increase to at least 1.5 times baseline within 7 days, or urine output 0.5 mL/kg/h or less for 6 hours, and staging is based on the magnitude of creatinine rise or urine output decline, with Stage 3 including a creatinine increase to 3.0 times baseline or initiation of renal replacement therapy, so I should verify baseline creatinine and document the timing of changes carefully [^112LuMYS] [^112QvBnQ] [^114hCmd7].

> Wait, let me verify the baseline creatinine issue, because misclassification is common. If a true baseline is unknown, using the first available value in the current episode is reasonable, but I should acknowledge that this can misclassify some cases; ERBP emphasizes using admission creatinine as the reference point and cautions against using eGFR formulas in AKI, which assume steady state and can be misleading in acute disease, so I need to ensure I interpret changes in the context of the clinical course rather than relying on eGFR in the acute setting [^116QKB7G] [^1112ZGjH].

> Next, I should review the initial clinical assessment, and I need to ensure I do not jump to conclusions before gathering key data. A structured history should cover comorbidities, recent hypotension or sepsis, nephrotoxin exposures including NSAIDs, ACE inhibitors, ARBs, aminoglycosides, contrast, and herbal agents, and any prior kidney disease, while the physical exam must prioritize volume status, hemodynamics, and signs of systemic disease such as rash or arthralgia that could suggest vasculitis or interstitial nephritis, because these elements shape pretest probabilities and guide testing and treatment [^113jpeEY] [^113bGqC5].

> Hold on, I should verify risk stratification and monitoring cadence. Patients at higher risk, such as those with CKD, diabetes, heart failure, liver disease, older age, or critical illness, warrant more frequent creatinine and urine output checks, and in the ICU dynamic hemodynamic assessment with ultrasound or functional monitors is preferred over static measures like CVP to guide perfusion-targeted therapy, so I will tailor the intensity of monitoring to risk and trajectory rather than a fixed schedule [^111taSwX] [^1116FBxo].

> I will now examine the core laboratory evaluation, and I need to ensure I interpret results in the context of volume status and comorbidities. Basic labs should include serial creatinine and BUN, electrolytes and acid–base status, CBC for infection or bleeding, and urinalysis with microscopy, because the urine sediment can rapidly distinguish prerenal, intrinsic, and postrenal processes and guide urgency, while fractional excretion of sodium or urea helps in prerenal versus intrinsic differentiation when diuretics confound interpretation [^1116FBxo] [^117E4SRg].

> Let me consider imaging next, and I should double-check timing. Renal tract ultrasound is recommended in essentially all patients with AKI to exclude obstruction, ideally within 24 hours, and within 6 hours if obstruction is suspected or if there is concern for pyonephrosis, because relieving obstruction is a reversible, time-sensitive intervention that alters management and prognosis [^117G2kG1].

> But wait, what if the etiology remains unclear after initial testing. I should escalate to targeted diagnostics based on pretest probability: for suspected glomerulonephritis or vasculitis, send ANCA, anti-GBM, ANA, complements, and consider urgent nephrology input; for thrombotic microangiopathy, check ADAMTS13 and hemolysis labs; for interstitial nephritis, look for eosinophilia and drug exposure; and for suspected contrast-induced AKI, evaluate timing relative to contrast and consider alternative explanations, recognizing that many ICU patients have multifactorial AKI and that biomarkers may help refine etiology in select contexts [^113WaNtg] [^1144oY3i] [^113o6ZPU].

> I should confirm the role of novel biomarkers, and I need to be cautious not to overpromise. Functional markers like cystatin C and damage markers such as NGAL, KIM-1, and cell cycle arrest biomarkers can detect injury earlier than creatinine and may improve risk stratification, but they are not yet replacements for creatinine and urine output; ADQI recommends integrating a combination of damage and functional biomarkers with clinical data to identify high-risk patients and guide care pathways, while acknowledging heterogeneity and the need for local validation before routine adoption [^1128wWJv] [^113o6ZPU] [^112kmnFc].

> Next, I should review follow-up and longitudinal care, and I must not forget the 3‑month checkpoint. KDIGO advises evaluating all AKI survivors about 3 months after the episode for resolution, new CKD, or worsening of preexisting CKD, given the substantial risk of CKD progression and cardiovascular sequelae after AKI; this follow-up should include blood pressure, creatinine with eGFR once steady state returns, urinalysis for albuminuria, and risk-factor modification, and I should document the episode clearly for future care transitions [^115ffDN6] [^111zactY].

> Hold on, I should verify documentation and coding nuances, because these affect both care and epidemiology. I need to record the baseline creatinine, the timing and magnitude of creatinine rise or urine output decline, the presumed etiology, and the AKI stage, and I should avoid relying on eGFR formulas in the acute phase; additionally, I should distinguish AKI from AKD when kidney abnormalities persist beyond 7 days but less than 3 months, as this affects prognosis and follow-up intensity [^116QKB7G] [^112vfKRP].

> Let me reconsider areas of controversy so I do not overgeneralize. Some experts caution that KDIGO stage-based management algorithms may be too rigid and not evidence-based for individual patient care, arguing that management should remain clinically driven rather than stage-protocolized; I should acknowledge this while still using staging to communicate severity and trigger appropriate surveillance and consultation, and I should individualize decisions about ICU transfer, RRT, and drug dosing adjustments rather than applying fixed stage thresholds reflexively [^114YTEht] [^112iLPxP].

> Finally, I need to ensure my approach remains iterative and responsive to new data. AKI is heterogeneous and dynamic, so serial reassessment of volume, hemodynamics, labs, and urine output, along with repeated consideration of evolving etiologies, is essential; if the clinical picture changes, I should verify whether the diagnosis or stage needs updating and adjust the workup accordingly, keeping the focus on identifying reversible causes and preventing further injury [^1116FBxo] [^1164LfZV].

---

The AKI workup centers on **prompt recognition** using KDIGO criteria (serum creatinine rise ≥ 0.3 mg/dL within 48 hours, ≥ 1.5× baseline within 7 days, or urine output ≤ 0.5 mL/kg/h for 6 hours) [^112LuMYS] and **rapid etiologic classification** into prerenal, intrinsic, or postrenal causes [^116zoaEu]. Immediate steps include a focused history, exam, and core labs (CBC, electrolytes, BUN/creatinine, urinalysis with microscopy) [^1116FBxo]; obtain renal ultrasound within 24 hours to exclude obstruction unless the cause is clear or improving [^117G2kG1]. Use **FENa/FEUrea** to distinguish prerenal from intrinsic causes when diuretics are used [^1116FBxo] [^117E4SRg]. Reserve biopsy for unexplained intrinsic AKI or suspected glomerulonephritis/vasculitis [^112jrwGk]. Monitor creatinine and urine output closely, stop nephrotoxins, correct volume status, and arrange nephrology consult for severe or unresolved cases [^115mZSsL].

---

## Diagnostic criteria and staging

AKI is defined and staged by **KDIGO** using serum creatinine and urine output [^112LuMYS]:

| **Stage** | **Serum creatinine criteria** | **Urine output criteria** |
|-|-|-|
| Stage 1 | Increase ≥ 0.3 mg/dL within 48 hours or 1.5–1.9× baseline within 7 days | ≤ 0.5 mL/kg/h for 6–12 hours |
| Stage 2 | Increase 2.0–2.9× baseline within 7 days | ≤ 0.5 mL/kg/h for ≥ 12 hours |
| Stage 3 | Increase ≥ 3.0× baseline or ≥ 4.0 mg/dL with acute rise ≥ 0.5 mg/dL within 7 days | ≤ 0.3 mL/kg/h for ≥ 24 hours or anuria ≥ 12 hours |

---

## Initial clinical assessment

A structured **history and physical examination** are essential to identify risk factors, exposures, and reversible causes [^113bGqC5]:

- **History**: Recent illnesses, surgeries, trauma, nephrotoxin exposure (NSAIDs, ACEi/ARBs, aminoglycosides, contrast), comorbidities (CKD, diabetes, heart failure, liver disease), and symptoms (oliguria, hematuria, edema, rash, arthralgia) [^113jpeEY].
- **Physical examination**: Volume status (JVP, edema, lung crackles), blood pressure, signs of systemic illness (rash, joint swelling), and bladder distension suggesting obstruction [^113jpeEY].

---

## Essential laboratory tests

Core laboratory evaluation should include:

- **CBC**: Evaluate for anemia, infection, bleeding.
- **Electrolytes, BUN, creatinine**: Assess kidney function, acid-base status, electrolyte disturbances.
- **Urinalysis with microscopy**: Identify proteinuria, hematuria, casts (RBC, WBC, granular), and guide etiologic classification [^1116FBxo].
- **Fractional excretion of sodium (FENa) and urea (FEUrea)**: Differentiate prerenal (FENa < 1%, FEUrea < 35%) from intrinsic renal causes, especially with diuretic use [^notfound].

---

## Imaging studies

Renal ultrasound is indicated in most patients to assess kidney size, echogenicity, and exclude obstruction; obtain within 24 hours unless the cause is clear or improving, and **within 6 hours if obstruction is suspected** [^117G2kG1].

---

## Advanced diagnostic tests

Reserve advanced testing for specific clinical scenarios:

- **Autoimmune serology**: ANCA, anti-GBM, ANA, complement levels for suspected glomerulonephritis or vasculitis [^113WaNtg].
- **Hematologic tests**: Direct Coombs, hemolysis labs for suspected thrombotic microangiopathy [^113WaNtg].
- **Renal biopsy**: Unexplained intrinsic AKI, suspected glomerulonephritis, vasculitis, or interstitial nephritis [^notfound].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Close monitoring of serum creatinine, urine output, and electrolytes is essential, with **frequency individualized** by severity and clinical course [^115ffDN6]. Stop nephrotoxins, correct volume status, and treat complications promptly [^115mZSsL]. Arrange nephrology consultation for severe AKI, uncertain diagnosis, or need for renal replacement therapy [^112jrwGk].

---

## Special considerations

- **Contrast-associated AKI**: Evaluate for recent contrast exposure and manage proactively [^1144oY3i].
- **Drug-induced AKI**: Review all medications, including OTC and herbal agents, and discontinue potential nephrotoxins [^113jpeEY].
- **Post-AKI follow-up**: Evaluate at 3 months for resolution or progression to CKD [^115ffDN6].

---

The AKI workup emphasizes **early recognition**, rapid etiologic classification, and targeted testing, with ultrasound to exclude obstruction and biopsy reserved for unresolved intrinsic cases. Close monitoring and nephrology input improve outcomes.

### Evaluation and initial management of acute kidney injury [^116zoaEu]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2008). Low credibility.

The evaluation and initial management of patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) should include: (1) an assessment of the contributing causes of the kidney injury, (2) an assessment of the clinical course including comorbidities, (3) a careful assessment of volume status, and (4) the institution of appropriate therapeutic measures designed to reverse or prevent worsening of functional or structural kidney abnormalities. The initial assessment of patients with AKI classically includes the differentiation between prerenal, renal, and postrenal causes. The differentiation between so-called "prerenal" and "renal" causes is more difficult, especially because renal hypoperfusion may coexist with any stage of AKI. Using a modified Delphi approach, the multidisciplinary international working group, generated a set of testable research questions. Key questions included the following: Is there a difference in prognosis between volume-responsive and volume-unresponsive AKI? Are there biomarkers whose patterns (dynamic changes) predict the severity and recovery of AKI (maximal stage of AKI, need for RRT, renal recovery, mortality) and guide therapy? What is the best biomarker to assess prospectively whether AKI is volume responsive? What is the best biomarker to assess the optimal volume status in AKI patients? In evaluating the current literature and ongoing studies, it was thought that the answers to the questions posed herein would improve the understanding of AKI, and ultimately patient outcomes.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common and serious problem affecting millions and causing death and disability for many. In 2012, Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes completed the first ever, international, multidisciplinary, clinical practice guideline for AKI. The guideline is based on evidence review and appraisal, and covers AKI definition, risk assessment, evaluation, prevention, and treatment. In this review we summarize key aspects of the guideline including definition and staging of AKI, as well as evaluation and nondialytic management. Contrast-induced AKI and management of renal replacement therapy will be addressed in a separate review. Treatment recommendations are based on systematic reviews of relevant trials. Appraisal of the quality of the evidence and the strength of recommendations followed the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach. Limitations of the evidence are discussed and a detailed rationale for each recommendation is provided.

### Diagnostic work-up and specific causes of acute kidney injury [^116MgyqL]. Intensive Care Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is common in critically ill patients and associated with grim short- and long-term outcome. Although in the vast majority of cases AKI is multifactorial, with sepsis, shock and nephrotoxicity accounting for most episodes, specific causes of AKI are not uncommon. Despite remaining uncertainties regarding their prevalence in the ICU, prompt recognition of specific aetiologies of AKI is likely to ensure timely management, limit worsening of renal dysfunction, and ultimately limit renal and systemic consequences of AKI. The ability to recognize conditions that may be associated with specific aetiologies and the appropriate use of clinical imaging, biological and immunological tests, along with optimal assessment of the need for renal biopsies, should be part of routine ICU care. In this review, we summarize uncertainties, current knowledge and recent advances regarding specific types of AKI. We describe the most common specific causes as well as rare aetiologies requiring urgent management, and outline available tools that may be used during the diagnostic work-up along with their limitations.

### Recommendations on acute kidney injury biomarkers from the Acute Disease Quality Initiative consensus conference: a consensus statement [^1128wWJv]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Importance

In the last decade, new biomarkers for acute kidney injury (AKI) have been identified and studied in clinical trials. Guidance is needed regarding how best to incorporate them into clinical practice.

Objective

To develop recommendations on AKI biomarkers based on existing data and expert consensus for practicing clinicians and researchers.

Evidence Review

At the 23rd Acute Disease Quality Initiative meeting, a meeting of 23 international experts in critical care, nephrology, and related specialties, the panel focused on 4 broad areas, as follows: (1) AKI risk assessment; (2) AKI prediction and prevention; (3) AKI diagnosis, etiology, and management; and (4) AKI progression and kidney recovery. A literature search revealed more than 65 000 articles published between 1965 and May 2019. In a modified Delphi process, recommendations and consensus statements were developed based on existing data, with 90% agreement among panel members required for final adoption. Recommendations were graded using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations system.

Findings

The panel developed 11 consensus statements for biomarker use and 14 research recommendations. The key suggestions were that a combination of damage and functional biomarkers, along with clinical information, be used to identify high-risk patient groups, improve the diagnostic accuracy of AKI, improve processes of care, and assist the management of AKI.

Conclusions and Relevance

Current evidence from clinical studies supports the use of new biomarkers in prevention and management of AKI. Substantial gaps in knowledge remain, and more research is necessary.

### Acute kidney injury 2016: diagnosis and diagnostic workup [^113gSKbC]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Acute kidney injury is a clinical syndrome defined by a rise in serum creatinine and/or fall in urine output as per KDIGO classification. Future definitions are likely to incorporate novel functional and damage biomarkers to characterise AKI better. Early diagnosis and appropriate diagnostic work-up are essential to determine the underlying aetiology and to identify cases of AKI that require specific and timely therapeutic interventions. The exact diagnostic investigations depend on the clinical context and should include routine baseline tests as well as more specific and novel tools.

### Acute kidney injury 2016: diagnosis and diagnostic workup [^112NaGMt]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Diagnosis of acute kidney disease

AKI is defined as occurring over 7 days and CKD starts when kidney disease has persisted for more than 90 days. Based on epidemiological studies and histological case series, it is clear that some patients have a slow but persistent (creeping) rise in serum creatinine over days or weeks but do not strictly fulfil the consensus criteria for AKI. To classify this phase between the early stage of AKI (first 7 days) and the onset of CKD (beyond 3 months), the KDIGO expert group proposed the term "acute kidney disease" (AKD) and suggested the following criteria: a GFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m² for < 3 months, a decrease in GFR by ≥ 35%, and an increase in serum creatinine by > 50% for < 3 months or evidence of structural kidney damage for < 3 months. These criteria are currently under revision (personal communication with the ADQI group).

Diagnosis of AKI

The diagnosis of AKI is traditionally based on a rise in serum creatinine and/or fall in urine output. The definition has evolved from the Risk, Injury, Failure, Loss, End-stage (RIFLE) criteria in 2004 to the AKI Network (AKIN) classification in 2007. In 2012, both were merged resulting in the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) classification. Accordingly, AKI is diagnosed if serum creatinine increases by 0.3 mg/dl (26.5 μmol/l) or more in 48 h or rises to at least 1.5-fold from baseline within 7 days (Table 1). AKI stages are defined by the maximum change of either serum creatinine or urine output. The importance of both criteria was confirmed in a recent study in > 32,000 critically ill patients which showed that short- and long-term risk of death or renal replacement therapy (RRT) were greatest when patients met both criteria for AKI and when these abnormalities persisted for longer than 3 days.

Table 1
KDIGO definition and classification of AKI

AKI acute kidney injury, GFR glomerular filtration rate, KDIGO Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes, RRT renal replacement therapy

Several studies in various different patient populations have confirmed an association between stages of AKI and short- and long-term outcomes. However, serum creatinine and urine output are markers of excretory function only and do not provide any information about any other roles of the kidney, i.e. metabolic, endocrine, or immunological functions. They are also not kidney specific and need to be interpreted within the clinical context. Some patients fulfil the AKI definition but do not have AKI, and there are also patients with clear evidence of renal injury who do not meet the creatinine or urine criteria for AKI (Table 2).

### Acute kidney injury 2016: diagnosis and diagnostic workup [^116uvW8Z]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a syndrome characterised by a rapid (hours to days) deterioration of kidney function. It is often diagnosed in the context of other acute illnesses and is particularly common in critically ill patients. The clinical consequences of AKI include the accumulation of waste products, electrolytes, and fluid, but also less obvious effects, including reduced immunity and dysfunction of non-renal organs (organ cross-talk).

The impact and prognosis of AKI vary considerably depending on the severity, clinical setting, comorbid factors, and also geographical location. There is increasing evidence that AKI is associated with serious short- and long-term complications, in particular increased mortality and morbidity, the development of chronic kidney disease (CKD), and high financial healthcare costs. As such, AKI is now recognized as a major public health problem.

Rapid diagnosis and appropriate diagnostic workup are essential to identify those types of AKI where specific therapies and interventions are available to reverse the injurious process within the kidneys. This review will summarise the key aspects of diagnosis and diagnostic work-up with particular focus on patients in the intensive care unit (ICU).

### KDIGO clinical practice guidelines for acute kidney injury [^114hCmd7]. Nephron: Clinical Practice (2012). Medium credibility.

KDIGO acute kidney injury (AKI) diagnostic timeframes and staging — diagnosis uses either change in serum creatinine (SCr) within 1 week or a 0.3 mg/dl (26.5 μmol/l) increase within 48 hours (Recommendation 2.1.1). The 1-week or 48-hour periods may occur at any time and are for diagnosis, not staging; staging spans the entire episode, such that a 50% SCr increase in 5 days that ultimately reaches a three-fold increase over 3 weeks would be diagnosed as AKI and staged as Stage 3.

### KDIGO clinical practice guidelines for acute kidney injury [^115mZSsL]. Nephron: Clinical Practice (2012). Medium credibility.

KDIGO acute kidney injury (AKI) stage-based management — priority actions across high-risk patients and AKI stages include to discontinue all nephrotoxic agents when possible, ensure volume status and perfusion pressure, consider functional hemodynamic monitoring, monitor serum creatinine and urine output, avoid hyperglycemia, consider alternatives to radiocontrast procedures, conduct non-invasive diagnostic workup followed by invasive diagnostic workup as appropriate, check for changes in drug dosing, consider renal replacement therapy (RRT), consider intensive-care unit (ICU) admission, and avoid subclavian catheters if possible; shading indicates priority of action and that some actions are equally appropriate at all stages with graded shading indicating increasing priority as intensity increases.

### KDIGO clinical practice guidelines for acute kidney injury [^112714HR]. Nephron: Clinical Practice (2012). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "KDIGO diagnostic criteria for acute kidney injury" for acute kidney injury.

The KDIGO diagnostic criteria for acute kidney injury is a clinical tool designed for the identification and classification of acute kidney injury (AKI). It serves a crucial role in the early detection of AKI, facilitating timely intervention and potentially improving patient outcomes.

The primary components of the KDIGO criteria include changes in serum creatinine and urine output. Specifically, the criteria are met if any of the following conditions are present: an increase in serum creatinine by ≥ 0.3 mg/dL [≥ 26.5 mcmol/L] within 48 hours, an increase in serum creatinine to ≥ 1.5 times baseline within the previous 7 days, or a urine volume of ≤ 0.5 mL/kg/hour for 6 hours.

The result is determined based on the presence or absence of these conditions. If any of the conditions are met, the diagnostic criteria for AKI are fulfilled. Conversely, if none of these conditions are present, the diagnostic criteria for AKI are not met. This straightforward approach allows for rapid assessment and diagnosis in a clinical setting.

The tool assesses whether a person meets the KDIGO (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes) diagnostic criteria for acute kidney injury (AKI). It evaluates three specific medical measurements provided by the user. Each measurement is checked against defined thresholds to determine if the criteria for AKI are met.

The tool uses the following diagnostic criteria:

The first criterion checks for an increase in serum creatinine by 0.3 mg/dL (or 26.5 mcmol/L) within 48 hours. If this is true, it indicates a potential diagnosis of AKI.

The second criterion evaluates whether there is an increase in serum creatinine to 1.5 times the baseline level in the previous 7 days. Again, a positive result supports a diagnosis of AKI.

The third criterion assesses urine volume, specifically whether it is 0.5 mL/kg/hour or less over 6 hours. If this condition is met, it further supports the diagnosis of AKI.

The tool processes the inputs by checking which of these conditions have been met:

| **Criterion description** | **Condition** |
|-|-|
| Increase in serum creatinine by ≥ 0.3 mg/dL (≥ 26.5 mcmol/L) within 48 hours| If this condition is true, it supports AKI diagnosis. |
| Increase in serum creatinine to ≥ 1.5 times baseline within the previous 7 days| If this condition is true, it supports AKI diagnosis. |
| Urine volume of ≤ 0.5 mL/kg/hour for 6 hours | If this condition is true, it supports AKI diagnosis. |
| All conditions false | "Diagnostic criteria are not met" |
| At least one condition true | "Diagnostic criteria are met" |

### Improving outcomes of acute kidney injury: report of an initiative [^1169Qv9p]. Nature Clinical Practice: Nephrology (2007). Medium credibility.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a complex disorder comprising several etiological factors and occurring in multiple settings. The disorder has a variety of clinical manifestations that range from minimal elevation in serum creatinine level to anuric renal failure. We describe the formation of a multidisciplinary collaborative network focused on AKI. This Acute Kidney Injury Network has proposed uniform standards for diagnosing and classifying AKI. These proposed standards will need to be validated in future studies, a process that will be facilitated by the Acute Kidney Injury Network, which offers a forum that encourages acquisition of knowledge to improve patient outcomes.

### A framework and key research questions in AKI diagnosis and staging in different environments [^111E9siD]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2008). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) is common worldwide, and associated with significant morbidity, mortality, and resource utilization. The RIFLE system of staging AKI correlates with survival in AKI in several settings. A similar AKI definition and staging system that also incorporates lesser degrees of serum creatinine elevation was proposed at the inaugural Acute Kidney Injury Network (AKIN) meeting in 2005. At the Second AKIN meeting in Vancouver, Canada in September 2006, our group developed a research agenda that would test the utility of these diagnostic and staging criteria to predict patient outcomes in a variety of clinical settings and patient groups.

Design, Setting, Participants & Measurements

Three-day, international, consensus conference. A multidisciplinary stakeholder committee was divided into work groups. Recommendations for clinical practice and for future research were developed by the committee as an iterative process. This procedure consisted of a literature review phase and focus group interactions with presentations to the entire committee.

Results

We first proposed a conceptual framework of disease that describes a series of AKI stages, antecedents and outcomes, and allows a description of research recommendations based on transition between AKI stages. We further proposed methods for testing of the definition and development of research questions to establish the utility of new biomarkers for the diagnosis and staging of AKI and associated illnesses.

Conclusions

Retrospective studies should be conducted to initiate the process of validating the AKIN definition of AKI, followed by comprehensive prospective studies that incorporate sampling for emerging AKI biomarkers.

### Biomarkers for the early detection and prognosis of acute kidney injury [^115MAEyi]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

AKI is an increasingly common disorder that is strongly linked to short- and long-term morbidity and mortality. Despite a growing heterogeneity in its causes, providing a timely and certain diagnosis of AKI remains challenging. In this review, we summarize the evolution of AKI biomarker studies over the past few years, focusing on two major areas of investigation: the early detection and prognosis of AKI. We highlight some of the lessons learned in conducting AKI biomarker studies, including ongoing attempts to address the limitations of creatinine as a reference standard and the recent shift toward evaluating the prognostic potential of these markers. Lastly, we suggest current gaps in knowledge and barriers that may be hindering their incorporation into care and a full ascertainment of their value.

### Recent advances in acute kidney injury epidemiology [^1153Jpbu]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Expanding rates of acute kidney injury (AKI) coupled with increasing awareness of its short-term and long-term sequelae have focused efforts to identify patients at risk for this disease and its complications. This review details the recent attempts to identify novel risk factors for AKI, describes further refinements in the diagnostic and prognostic approach using biological markers of injury, and highlights the features of AKI that independently predict poor long-term outcomes.

Recent Findings

The presence of proteinuria predicts the development of AKI independently of estimated glomerular filtration rate. Initial results from a large prospective study of AKI biomarkers in cardiac surgery indicate lower agreement with serum creatinine as an AKI standard than observed in early studies. AKI severity and duration are important predictors of chronic kidney disease and long-term mortality. A minority of patients surviving AKI with decreased kidney function is seen by a nephrologist.

Summary

Although the pathophysiologic link is unclear, proteinuria is an easily measurable risk factor for AKI worth considering before anticipated procedures or medication exposures carrying nephrologic risk. Investigation extending beyond agreement with serum creatinine is needed to fully understand the diagnostic and prognostic value of AKI biomarkers. Severity and duration are components of AKI that can help risk-stratify survivors in need of monitoring or nephrology referral.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a serious complication associated with morbidity and mortality. Studies from 2010 have provided insights into the diagnosis and clinical course of AKI, the ability of novel biomarkers to guide therapy, and the quality of life of survivors of severe AKI. It is hoped that these findings will lead to improvements in the diagnosis and prognosis of affected individuals.

NOMENCLATURE AND DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA

AKI-related definitions

AKI and chronic kidney disease (CKD) are increasingly recognized as related entities representing a continuum of disease. The National Kidney Foundation Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (NKF-KDOQI) 2002 guideline and the 2012 KDIGO AKI guideline defined CKD as measured or estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) < 60 ml/min per 1.73 m, or the presence of markers of kidney damage (e.g. albuminuria) for > 90 days. The 2012 KDIGO guideline defined AKI as an abrupt decrease in kidney function occurring over 7 days or fewer (Table 1). To complete the continuum, the 2012 guideline proposed the term acute kidney diseases and disorders (AKD) to define conditions of impaired kidney function not meeting the criteria for either AKI or CKD but having adverse outcomes and requiring clinical care. However, consensus on the exact criteria and indicators of severity is urgently needed.

Because the diagnosis of AKI should be tied to management decisions, and because changing disease definitions may have major implications for disease epidemiology, the case for revising the 2012 KDIGO definition of AKI should be strong before changes are proposed. Furthermore, in the context of an AKI guideline revision, several classification systems in addition to the stages of AKI should be rigorously defined. These relate to the distinctions among persistent, transient, relapsing, and recovered AKI; various etiologies of AKI; and community-onset versus hospital-onset AKI. In addition, there is emerging evidence that markers of structural kidney damage may be associated with clinically relevant outcomes and therefore identify potentially actionable entities. For an AKI guideline revision, the evidence base should be reviewed to determine whether markers of kidney damage constitute risk factors for AKI, define a new entity (such as subclinical or preclinical AKI), or should be incorporated into the AKI definition. Finally, the future guideline should use nomenclature that is precise and patient-centered.

Key messages

- AKI is a complex disorder, and we have proposed uniform standards for diagnosing and classifying AKI on the basis of existing systems (that is, RIFLE). These proposals will require validation.

- Our recommendations have been endorsed by participating societies that represent the majority of critical care and nephrology societies worldwide.

- These recommendations provide a stepping stone to standardizing the care of patients with AKI and will greatly enhance our ability to design prospective studies to evaluate potential prevention and treatment strategies.

- Future clinical and translational research in AKI will require the development of collaborative networks. The AKIN was formed to provide an effective mechanism for facilitating such efforts.

### Acute kidney injury network: report of an initiative to improve outcomes in acute kidney injury [^111prQff]. Critical Care (2007). Low credibility.

Introduction

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a complex disorder for which currently there is no accepted definition. Having a uniform standard for diagnosing and classifying AKI would enhance our ability to manage these patients. Future clinical and translational research in AKI will require collaborative networks of investigators drawn from various disciplines, dissemination of information via multidisciplinary joint conferences and publications, and improved translation of knowledge from pre-clinical research. We describe an initiative to develop uniform standards for defining and classifying AKI and to establish a forum for multidisciplinary interaction to improve care for patients with or at risk for AKI.

Methods

Members representing key societies in critical care and nephrology along with additional experts in adult and pediatric AKI participated in a two day conference in Amsterdam, The Netherlands, in September 2005 and were assigned to one of three workgroups. Each group's discussions formed the basis for draft recommendations that were later refined and improved during discussion with the larger group. Dissenting opinions were also noted. The final draft recommendations were circulated to all participants and subsequently agreed upon as the consensus recommendations for this report. Participating societies endorsed the recommendations and agreed to help disseminate the results.

Results

The term AKI is proposed to represent the entire spectrum of acute renal failure. Diagnostic criteria for AKI are proposed based on acute alterations in serum creatinine or urine output. A staging system for AKI which reflects quantitative changes in serum creatinine and urine output has been developed.

Conclusion

We describe the formation of a multidisciplinary collaborative network focused on AKI. We have proposed uniform standards for diagnosing and classifying AKI which will need to be validated in future studies. The Acute Kidney Injury Network offers a mechanism for proceeding with efforts to improve patient outcomes.

In 2012, Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) published a guideline on the classification and management of acute kidney injury (AKI). The guideline was derived from evidence available through February 2011. Since then, new evidence has emerged that has important implications for clinical practice in diagnosing and managing AKI. In April of 2019, KDIGO held a controversies conference entitled Acute Kidney Injury with the following goals: determine best practices and areas of uncertainty in treating AKI; review key relevant literature published since the 2012 KDIGO AKI guideline; address ongoing controversial issues; identify new topics or issues to be revisited for the next iteration of the KDIGO AKI guideline; and outline research needed to improve AKI management. Here, we present the findings of this conference and describe key areas that future guidelines may address.

### Biological markers of acute kidney injury [^117PdxEu]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2011). Low credibility.

An abrupt change in serum creatinine, the most common indicator of acute kidney injury (AKI), is strongly linked to poor outcomes across multiple clinical settings. Despite endless attempts to distill the magnitude and timing of a changing serum creatinine into a standardized metric, singular focus on this traditional functional marker obligates the characterization of AKI to remain, at best, retrospective and causally noninformative. The resultant inability to meaningfully segregate critical aspects of injury such as type, onset, propagation, and recovery from ongoing decrements in renal function has hindered successful translation of promising therapeutics. Over the past decade, however, the emerging field of clinical proteomics reinvigorates hope of identifying novel plasma and urine biomarkers to characterize cause and course of kidney injury. Efforts to validate these markers for use in clinical studies now show early promise but face important obstacles including interpretive difficulties inherent in using serum creatinine as a sole comparator for diagnostic performance, a need to better evaluate the incremental performance of new markers above established clinical and biochemical predictors, a relative lack of power to sufficiently examine hard clinical end points, and a potential over-reliance on use alone of receiver operating curves for assessing biomarker utility. Here, we discuss efforts to address these barriers and further ascertain the clinical value of new markers.

### Acute kidney injury [^116gQkzx]. Lancet (2025). Excellent credibility.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common, heterogeneous, multifactorial condition, which is part of the overarching syndrome of acute kidney diseases and disorders. This condition's incidence highest in low-income and middle-income countries. In the short term, AKI is associated with increased mortality, an increased risk of complications, extended stays in hospital, and high health-care costs. Long-term complications include chronic kidney disease, kidney failure, cardiovascular morbidity, and an increased risk of death. Several strategies are available to prevent and treat AKI in specific clinical contexts. Otherwise, AKI care is primarily supportive, focused on treatment of the underlying cause, prevention of further injury, management of complications, and short-term renal replacement therapy in case of refractory complications. Evidence confirming that AKI subphenotyping is necessary to identify precision-oriented interventions is growing. Long-term follow-up of individuals recovered from AKI is recommended but the most effective models of care remain unclear.

### Advances in the diagnosis of early biomarkers for acute kidney injury: a literature review [^112DoURG]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a heterogeneous group of conditions, typically occurring in the context of acute or chronic illness, characterized by a rapid decline in glomerular filtration rate (GFR), accompanied by an increase in serum creatinine concentration or a decrease in urine output. The term "acute" refers to kidney dysfunction occurring within hours to days, while "kidney injury" implies a potentially reversible condition that, if not promptly addressed, may progress to acute kidney disease (AKD) and even chronic kidney disease (CKD). AKI affects 15–20% of hospitalized patients, doubling the risk of in-hospital mortality and increasing the risk of CKD by fourfold. Current clinical diagnosis relies on serum creatinine levels, but its lagging nature limits the early diagnosis and treatment of AKI. As a marker of GFR, creatinine only increases when there is a significant drop in GFR or substantial parenchymal damage, and it does not reflect specific pathological processes. AKI primarily affects the tubules, with changes in GFR typically occurring only after tubular damage has progressed. The absence of changes in creatinine levels may lead to false reassurance, resulting in inappropriate medication dosing or delays in discontinuing nephrotoxic agents, thereby increasing the risk of worsening kidney injury.

Biomarkers are defined and categorized according to the BEST (Biomarkers, EndpointS, and other Tools) resource from the joint task force of the FDA and NIH, covering functions such as diagnosis, monitoring, prognosis, and prediction, and guiding the application of clinical and surrogate endpoint biomarkers. Ideally, biomarkers should be validated in multicenter and prospective cohorts, and tested in clinical trials for their impact on patient outcomes. As many researchers have advocated, in AKI, an ideal biomarker may not replace serum creatinine (SCr) and urine output but should be considered of additional value. In recent years, biomarkers for tubular injury, inflammation and repair, renal filtration, and oxidative stress have shown significant potential in the early detection and prognosis of AKI (Fig. 1). However, their clinical implementation faces challenges in terms of technology and validation, requiring large-scale studies to confirm their effectiveness. This review summarizes the current state of early diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for AKI, exploring their prospects in clinical practice and providing guidance to improve the diagnosis and treatment of AKI.

### KDIGO clinical practice guidelines for acute kidney injury [^112EpjgZ]. Nephron: Clinical Practice (2012). Medium credibility.

KDIGO acute kidney injury (AKI) — research recommendations state that the role of biomarkers other than SCr in the early diagnosis, differential diagnosis, and prognosis of AKI patients should be explored, including early detection where the gold standard is AKI by clinical diagnosis after the fact and the biomarker is compared to existing markers (SCr and urine output) at the time of presentation; prognosis where a biomarker is used to predict risk for AKI or risk for progression of AKI; and prognosis where a biomarker is used to predict recovery after AKI vs. death or need for long-term RRT. The influence of urinary output criteria on AKI staging needs to be further investigated, and influence of fluid balance, percent volume overload, diuretic use, and differing weights (actual, ideal body weight, lean body mass) should be considered; also, it is currently not known how urine volume criteria should be applied. The influence of whether SCr or eGFR criteria are used should be tested through simulation, and whether relative and absolute SCr increments or eGFR decrements at different time points and with differently ascertained baseline values requires further exploration and validation in various populations.

The panel "generally concurred with the remainder of the KDIGO guidelines that are focused on the prevention and pharmacologic and dialytic management of AKI", while emphasizing "the dearth of clinical trial evidence to provide strong evidence-based recommendations" and "the continued absence of effective therapies beyond hemodynamic optimization and avoidance of nephrotoxins for the prevention and treatment of AKI". For clinical context, AKI "represents the sudden loss of kidney function, generally occurring over the course of hours to days and resulting in the retention of metabolic waste products and the development of volume overload and electrolyte and acid-base abnormalities".

### Classification and staging of acute kidney injury: beyond the RIFLE and AKIN criteria [^1117NoeX]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2011). Medium credibility.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is often overlooked in hospitalized patients, despite the fact that even mild forms are strongly associated with poor clinical outcomes such as increased mortality, morbidity, cardiovascular failure and infections. Research endorsed by the Acute Dialysis Quality Initiative led to the publication of a consensus definition for AKI — the RIFLE criteria (Risk, Injury, Failure, Loss of function, and End-stage renal disease) — which was designed to standardize and classify renal dysfunction. These criteria, along with revised versions developed by the AKI Network (AKIN), can detect AKI with high sensitivity and high specificity and describe different severity levels that aim to predict the prognosis of affected patients. The RIFLE and AKIN criteria are easy to use in a variety of clinical and research settings, but have several limitations: both utilize an increase in serum creatinine level from a hypothetical baseline value and a decrease in urine output, but these surrogate markers of renal impairment manifest relatively late after injury has occurred and do not consider the nature or site of the kidney injury. New biomarkers for AKI have shown promise for early diagnosis and prediction of the prognosis of AKI. As more data become available, they could, in the future, be incorporated into improved definitions or criteria for AKI.

### Excessive diagnostic testing in acute kidney injury [^111rWcXj]. BMC Nephrology (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusions

In summary, a large number of diagnostic tests are available for the evaluation of AKI, and determining which test to order should be based on estimates of pre-test probability and performance characteristics of the test. Our data suggest that many of the currently available tests have limited clinical utility, even when they are abnormal or "positive". Thus, developing better diagnostic tests that provide reliable and actionable data on AKI diagnosis or management should be a priority in AKI research. The dearth of such tests may be a key reason why therapeutic advances to improve outcomes in AKI have been largely unsuccessful.

### Excessive diagnostic testing in acute kidney injury [^114nwQ4J]. BMC Nephrology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is an increasingly common complication among hospitalized patients, and is associated with increased mortality, development of chronic kidney disease, and increased resource utilization. The optimal diagnostic approach to AKI is not well established.

The traditional approach to the differential diagnosis of AKI emphasizes three broad categories: pre-renal AKI, which results from inadequate perfusion of the kidneys; post-renal AKI, which results from obstruction to the flow of urine; and intrinsic causes of AKI, which can be due to injury or dysfunction of the glomeruli, other blood vessels, tubules, or the interstitium. A large number of diagnostic tests are available for the investigation of AKI. Determining which test to order in which patient with AKI should be based on estimates of pre-test probability from the clinical context and an appreciation of the diagnostic performance characteristics of the various tests available.

Previous studies have examined the utility of some AKI diagnostic tests in isolation, such renal ultrasonography and urine microscopy, but none have comprehensively assessed the patterns and clinical utility of a wide range of diagnostic tests in patients with AKI. We performed this study to identify the frequency with which various urine, blood, radiology, and pathology tests are ordered in patients with AKI, and to assess their diagnostic yield.

KDOQI US commentary — evaluation and management positions for AKI state that the authors "strongly concur with the KDIGO recommendations that the cause of AKI should be determined whenever possible" and that "patients with AKI should be evaluated promptly to determine the cause, with special attention to reversible causes", but they express concerns that "the stage-based management recommendations… are not adequately evidence based" and "implicitly assume homogeneity within each AKI stage and successive increases in severity across stages". They note "the lack of correlation between serum creatinine level and GFR in the acute setting", such that increases in serum creatinine can yield "apparent progression in AKI stage, despite improvement in GFR", and describe the recommendations as "relatively nonspecific and unlikely to help in daily clinical practice". They caution that "development of clinical action plans based on AKI stage may result in inappropriate protocolization of care", and cite examples where "waiting until stage 2 AKI to check for changes in drug dosing" is implied and recommendations to consider renal replacement therapy (RRT) and "intensive care unit admission in stage 2 AKI seem premature". They also "agree with the emphasis on close postdischarge clinical evaluation of patients with moderate to severe AKI".

### Acute kidney injury: from clinical to molecular diagnosis [^113ba7us]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

The incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI) is increasing especially in hospitalized patients and particularly in the ICU due to major surgery, iatrogenic interventions, and sepsis. In such conditions, age and comorbidities make the kidneys more susceptible to various exposures and insults. Diagnostic criteria based on oliguria and serum creatinine (SCr) seem inadequate to describe the wide spectrum of mechanisms and conditions of AKI (Fig. 1). The RIFLE, AKIN, and KDIGO classifications have made some important advancements but they still rely only on urine output and SCr, precluding the possibility of a timely and accurate AKI diagnosis, and neglecting subclinical forms of kidney dysfunction and damage.

Fig. 1
Evolution of AKI diagnostic syntax. The discovery and validation of cell cycle arrest biomarkers, neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin, and other markers have permitted introduction of the concepts of AKI risk, kidney stress, and subclinical AKI. Quantitative evaluation of these markers has moved the diagnosis of AKI from the clinical/biochemical level to the cellular/molecular level. AKI acute kidney injury, AKIN Acute Kidney Injury Network, KDIGO Kidney Disease Global Outcome Initiative, RIFLE Risk, Injury, Failure, Loss and End Stage Kidney Disease, ATN Acute Tubular Necrosis, ARF Acute Renal Failure

New biomarkers can detect a risk of AKI or subclinical kidney damage earlier, allowing development of a new conceptual model for AKI with a continuum from initial kidney stress and early injury to advanced kidney damage and/or failure. The acute phase has also been called "Kidney Attack" while the subsequent phases in the time window of 90 days are described as acute kidney disease (AKD). Full recovery or maladaptive repair with progression towards chronic kidney disease (CKD) is also a pathway described in the model. At each point of the continuum, biomarkers may play a role in clarifying mechanisms and clinical evolution of AKI. Studies on biomarkers have described their positive and negative predicting value for the presence and severity of the syndrome, site of damage, need for renal replacement therapy (RRT), and recovery or progression towards CKD. Unfortunately, these studies present a high degree of heterogeneity, and meaningful conclusions are only obtained in specific populations.

KDIGO acute kidney injury (AKI) evaluation — AKI is a clinical syndrome with multiple etiologies and is heterogeneous, guiding a thorough clinical assessment. The clinical evaluation of AKI includes a careful history and physical examination. Drug history should include over-the-counter formulations and herbal remedies or recreational drugs. The social history should include exposure to tropical diseases (e.g., malaria), waterways or sewage systems, and exposure to rodents (e.g., leptospirosis, hantavirus). Physical examination should include evaluation of fluid status, signs for acute and chronic heart failure, infection, and sepsis. Measurement of cardiac output, preload, preload responsiveness, and intra-abdominal pressure should be considered. Figure 5 illustrates an approach to evaluation of AKI.

In response to the recently released 2012 KDIGO (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes) clinical practice guideline for acute kidney injury (AKI), the National Kidney Foundation organized a group of US experts in adult and pediatric AKI and critical care nephrology to review the recommendations and comment on their relevancy in the context of current US clinical practice and concerns. The first portion of the KDIGO guideline attempts to harmonize earlier consensus definitions and staging criteria for AKI. While the expert panel thought that the KDIGO definition and staging criteria are appropriate for defining the epidemiology of AKI and in the design of clinical trials, the panel concluded that there is insufficient evidence to support their widespread application to clinical care in the United States. The panel generally concurred with the remainder of the KDIGO guidelines that are focused on the prevention and pharmacologic and dialytic management of AKI, although noting the dearth of clinical trial evidence to provide strong evidence-based recommendations and the continued absence of effective therapies beyond hemodynamic optimization and avoidance of nephrotoxins for the prevention and treatment of AKI.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a heterogeneous clinical syndrome that has multiple aetiologies, variable pathogenesis and diverse outcomes. However, these heterogeneities are not reflected in current approaches to the diagnosis and, to some degree, treatment of AKI. For example, congestive heart failure and dehydration can produce identical changes in serum creatinine level and urine output (parameters that are used to define AKI); however, they differ vastly in their physiological contexts and demand completely opposite treatments. AKI is often still considered to be a homogeneous clinical entity, which implies a uniform pathogenesis and a well-defined prognosis. As a consequence, efforts to find effective AKI treatments have been hampered by a lack of clear clinical classifications for various types of AKI. In addition, subclassification of AKI into subclinical phenotypes - for example, on the basis of protein biomarkers and other in vitro diagnostics that take into account disease aetiology and underlying pathogenesis - might be necessary to develop therapeutic approaches that effectively target the widely differing pathomechanisms of AKI. In this Review, we discuss the major subtypes of AKI that are associated with sepsis, major surgery, renal hypoperfusion and nephrotoxin exposure -situations that are typically seen in the intensive care setting. We consider differences and similarities in their phenotype, pathogenesis and outcomes and how this information might be used to guide treatment.

### Subclinical AKI is still AKI [^112EtxoM]. Critical Care (2012). Low credibility.

The concept of acute kidney syndromes has shifted in recent years from acute renal failure to acute kidney injury (AKI). AKI implies injury or damage but not necessarily dysfunction. The human kidney has an important glomerular function reserve, and dysfunction becomes evident only when more than 50% of the renal mass is compromised. Recent AKI classifications include even slight changes in serum creatinine, acknowledging that this condition is associated with worse outcomes. This, however, still represents a functional criterion for AKI and implies a glomerular filtration rate alteration that may be a late phenomenon in the time course of the syndrome. An early diagnosis of AKI by using tubular damage biomarkers preceding filtration function loss is possible today. Some studies have shown evidence that there is an additional value of new biomarkers not only because they allow a diagnosis to be made earlier but also because they allow a kidney injury to be diagnosed even in the absence of subsequent dysfunction. Only recently, tubular damage without glomerular function loss was demonstrated to be associated with worse renal and overall outcomes. For this condition, the term 'subclinical' AKI has been introduced, challenging the traditional view that a kidney problem is clinically relevant, only when a loss of filtration function becomes apparent. A new domain of AKI diagnosis could then include functional criteria and damage criteria. This may have an impact on the epidemiology, prevention, and management of AKI.

### Acute kidney injury 2016: diagnosis and diagnostic workup [^1112ZGjH]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Similar problems may occur when defining AKI stage 3 by the RRT criterion. The optimal timing of RRT for AKI is not known and clinical practice is very variable. As such, AKI staging depends directly on the decision-making process of the clinician rather than underlying renal function.

Finally, single serum creatinine values do not provide any information about specific stages of the AKI process. Importantly, they do not indicate whether a patient is still in the progression phase or if recovery has already begun. Also, eGFR formulae are not valid to determine renal function in AKI.

Limitations of urine-based criteria for AKI

Urine output is an important clinical marker but, like creatinine, is not renal specific. In fact, urine output may persist until renal function almost ceases. Similarly, oliguria may be an appropriate physiological response of functioning kidneys during periods of prolonged fasting, hypovolaemia, after surgery, and following stress, pain, or trauma. In these situations, the action of anti-diuretic hormone (ADH) can result in the generation of very concentrated urine with osmolarities up to 1400 mmosm/l. Assuming a daily solute load of 700 mosmoles, the urine volume may physiologically decrease to 500 mL (i.e. 0.28 ml/kg/h in a 70 kg person) as a result of normal kidney function.

The KDIGO criteria for AKI are based on the presence of oliguria for a minimum of 6 h. Several experts have questioned the validity of this arbitrary cut-off and suggest using either a longer minimum period (e.g. 12 h) or a lower threshold for urinary output (e.g. 0.3 ml/kg/h instead of 0.5 ml/kg/h) to reach sufficient specificity for diagnosing AKI.

Finally, in obese patients, weight-based urine output criteria may be particularly misleading (Table 2). In fact, the European Renal Best Practice Guidelines (2012) recommend using the ideal weight rather than the true weight when calculating urine output in ml/min/kg to avoid an overdiagnosis of AKI.

Adjunctive diagnostic tools to diagnose AKI

In certain circumstances, it may be necessary to use additional tools to diagnose AKI, especially where creatinine and urine values change only slowly, are misleading, or cannot be interpreted accurately. This is particularly relevant for critically ill patients where the presence of fluid overload, muscle wasting, sepsis, and reduced effective circulating volume may completely mask the diagnosis of AKI.

KDIGO AKI clinical applications — example cases illustrate diagnosis of acute kidney injury (AKI) using serum creatinine (SCr)-based criteria. Cases A–F have baseline SCr and an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) that exceeds 60 ml/min per 1.73 m² so none has pre-existing CKD, and AKI can be diagnosed by applying the first two criteria: at least 0.3 mg/dl (> 26.5 μmol/l) within 48 hours or a 50% increase from presumed baseline; these are labeled in the table as Criterion 1 50% from baseline and Criterion 2 ≥ 0.3 mg/dl (≥ 26.5 μmol/l) rise in ≤ 48 hours, and meeting either criterion 1 or 2 (or 3, urine output) qualifies. Illustratively, for Case A the serum creatinine mg/dl (μmol/l) values are baseline 1.0 (88), day 1 1.3 (115), day 2 1.5 (133), day 3 2.0 (177), and day 7 1.0 (88), with Yes for both criteria. Cases F–H do not have a baseline measurement of SCr available. Early diagnosis may improve outcome so it is advantageous to diagnose patients as rapidly as possible, and frequent measurement of SCr in high-risk patients, or in patients in which AKI is suspected, will significantly improve diagnostic time and accuracy.

### The definition of acute kidney injury and its use in practice [^112DGnHD]. Kidney International (2015). Low credibility.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common syndrome that is independently associated with increased mortality. A standardized definition is important to facilitate clinical care and research. The definition of AKI has evolved rapidly since 2004, with the introduction of the Risk, Injury, Failure, Loss, and End-stage renal disease (RIFLE), AKI Network (AKIN), and Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) classifications. RIFLE was modified for pediatric use (pRIFLE). They were developed using both evidence and consensus. Small rises in serum creatinine are independently associated with increased mortality, and hence are incorporated into the current definition of AKI. The recent definition from the international KDIGO guideline merged RIFLE and AKIN. Systematic review has found that these definitions do not differ significantly in their performance. Health-care staff caring for children or adults should use standard criteria for AKI, such as the pRIFLE or KDIGO definitions, respectively. These efforts to standardize AKI definition are a substantial advance, although areas of uncertainty remain. The new definitions have enabled the use of electronic alerts to warn clinicians of possible AKI. Novel biomarkers may further refine the definition of AKI, but their use will need to produce tangible improvements in outcomes and cost effectiveness. Further developments in AKI definitions should be informed by research into their practical application across health-care providers. This review will discuss the definition of AKI and its use in practice for clinicians and laboratory scientists.

Comparison of the areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves of several biomarkers with some clinical and/or routine biochemical outcome parameters reveals that none of the biomarkers has demonstrated a clear additional value beyond the traditional approach in clinical decision making in patients with AKI. Unscrutinized use of these biomarkers may distract from adequate clinical evaluation and carries the risk of worse instead of better patient outcome.

### Acute kidney injury [^115sSaVq]. Lancet (2019). Excellent credibility.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is defined by a rapid increase in serum creatinine, decrease in urine output, or both. AKI occurs in approximately 10–15% of patients admitted to hospital, while its incidence in intensive care has been reported in more than 50% of patients. Kidney dysfunction or damage can occur over a longer period or follow AKI in a continuum with acute and chronic kidney disease. Biomarkers of kidney injury or stress are new tools for risk assessment and could possibly guide therapy. AKI is not a single disease but rather a loose collection of syndromes as diverse as sepsis, cardiorenal syndrome, and urinary tract obstruction. The approach to a patient with AKI depends on the clinical context and can also vary by resource availability. Although the effectiveness of several widely applied treatments is still controversial, evidence for several interventions, especially when used together, has increased over the past decade.

### Defining acute kidney injury: what is the most appropriate metric? [^116vMrdK]. Nature Clinical Practice: Nephrology (2008). Medium credibility.

Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is the most widely accepted measure of kidney function. Acute kidney injury (AKI) is defined as a reduction in GFR. GFR is, however, rarely measured in clinical practice; instead, serum markers (primarily creatinine) are used to define AKI. Because serum creatinine level is not linearly related to GFR, the performance of this marker is associated with ascertainment bias and poor sensitivity. In this article we discuss the limitations and pitfalls of using serum markers to define AKI, and offer some suggestions for the future.

1. Proposal for uniform standards for definition and classification of AKI

Definition and diagnostic criteria of AKI

For any condition, the clinician needs to know whether the disease is present and, if so, where and when the patient falls in the natural history of the disease. The former facilitates recognition whereas the latter defines time points for intervention. Unfortunately, there has been no uniformly accepted definition of AKI. Studies describe ARF or AKI based on serum creatinine changes, absolute levels of serum creatinine, changes in blood urea nitrogen or urine output, or the need for dialysis. The wide variation in definitions has made it difficult to compare information across studies and populations.

Diagnostic criteria

Recognition of AKI requires the delineation of easily measured criteria that can be widely applied. Serum creatinine levels and changes in urine output are the most commonly applied measures of renal function; however, they are each influenced by factors other than the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and do not provide any information about the nature or site of kidney injury. The proposed diagnostic criteria (Table 1) were based on consideration of the following concepts:

Table 1
Diagnostic criteria for acute kidney injury

The above criteria include both an absolute and a percentage change in creatinine to accommodate variations related to age, gender, and body mass index and to reduce the need for a baseline creatinine but do require at least two creatinine values within 48 hours. The urine output criterion was included based on the predictive importance of this measure but with the awareness that urine outputs may not be measured routinely in non-intensive care unit settings. It is assumed that the diagnosis based on the urine output criterion alone will require exclusion of urinary tract obstructions that reduce urine output or of other easily reversible causes of reduced urine output. The above criteria should be used in the context of the clinical presentation and following adequate fluid resuscitation when applicable. Note: Many acute kidney diseases exist, and some (but not all) of them may result in acute kidney injury (AKI). Because diagnostic criteria are not documented, some cases of AKI may not be diagnosed. Furthermore, AKI may be superimposed on or lead to chronic kidney disease.

### Acute kidney injury: from clinical to molecular diagnosis [^112U842J]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

The RIFLE classification was introduced in 2004 to describe the presence of acute kidney injury (AKI) and to define its clinical stage, based upon the serum creatinine level and urine output. The same criteria, although slightly modified, are used in the other scoring systems AKIN and KDIGO. Mortality and morbidity remain high in AKI, suggesting that current diagnostic methods are suboptimal, poorly accurate, and often timely inadequate in detecting the presence of early kidney injury. Conversely, a growing body of evidence indicates that new AKI biomarkers can be used to both rule out AKI and to assess high-risk conditions or the presence of subclinical forms. Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin or cell cycle arrest biomarkers seem to be sensitive and specific enough to be used in conjunction with existing markers of AKI for better classifying renal injury as well as dysfunction. Improvements in diagnosis, risk identification, stratification, prognosis, and therapeutic monitoring may improve prevention and protection from organ damage and help to identify patients at risk, allowing individualized therapy. In this view, we may say that AKI diagnosis has finally moved from clinical to molecular level with potential benefits for the patients because similar progress has been shown in other disciplines.

### The RIFLE and AKIN classifications for acute kidney injury: a critical and comprehensive review [^111m84zK]. Clinical Kidney Journal (2013). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "AKIN diagnostic criteria for acute kidney injury" for acute kidney injury.

The AKIN (Acute Kidney Injury Network) classification for acute kidney injury is a diagnostic and severity grading system used in patients with suspected acute kidney injury (AKI). This calculator is applicable to all patient populations, including those in the intensive care unit, hospitalized patients, and outpatients.

The AKIN classification system is used to identify and stratify the severity of AKI based on changes in serum creatinine levels or urine output. It helps clinicians to determine the appropriate treatment strategies and predict patient outcomes.

The AKIN classification system is not suitable for patients with chronic kidney disease or those with pre-existing renal dysfunction, as the changes in serum creatinine levels or urine output may not accurately reflect the acute changes in kidney function in these patients.

The AKIN diagnostic criteria tool helps identify the severity of acute kidney injury (AKI) by evaluating changes in serum creatinine levels and urine output. The user starts by selecting one diagnostic criterion from a list of options, each reflecting different clinical measures.

These criteria include:

- Serum creatinine increase of at least 0.3 mg/dL (26.4 mcmol/L) or 1.5 to 2 times the baseline, with urine output less than 0.5 mL/kg/hour lasting over 6 hours.
- Serum creatinine increase of more than 2 to 3 times from baseline, combined with urine output less than 0.5 mL/kg/hour over a 12-hour period.
- Serum creatinine increase to or beyond 4 mg/dL (354 mcmol/L), with a rapid increment of at least 0.5 mg/dL (44 mcmol/L), or over 3 times the baseline value. This is associated with urine output below 0.3 mL/kg/hour for 24 hours, or complete lack of urine for 12 hours.

Using these criteria, the tool assigns an AKI stage:

- Stage 1 corresponds to the selection where serum creatinine increases are at least 0.3 mg/dL or 1.5–2 times above baseline paired with specified urine output reduction over 6 hours.
- Stage 2 signifies a creatinine increase of more than 2–3 times from baseline with decreased urine output extending past 12 hours.
- Stage 3 is indicated by the most severe changes in creatinine and urine output metrics, the latter showing significant reduction or lack of production over longer durations.

Each stage reflects increasing AKI severity, impacting clinical evaluation and management decisions. Recognizing the stage is critical for patient outcomes, steering appropriate interventions and monitoring.

The KDIGO guidelines for acute kidney injury (AKI) are designed to assist health-care providers around the world in managing patients with AKI. Clinical guidelines are intended to help the clinician make an informed decision based on review of the currently available evidence. Due to the generic nature of guidelines, it is sometimes difficult to translate a guideline for a particular individual patient who may have specific clinical circumstances. To illustrate this point, we have discussed the interpretation of the KDIGO guideline in patients who have subtleties in their clinical presentation, which may make treatment decisions less than straightforward.

### Acute kidney injury: a guide to diagnosis and management [^117E4SRg]. American Family Physician (2012). Low credibility.

Acute kidney injury is characterized by abrupt deterioration in kidney function, manifested by an increase in serum creatinine level with or without reduced urine output. The spectrum of injury ranges from mild to advanced, sometimes requiring renal replacement therapy. The diagnostic evaluation can be used to classify acute kidney injury as prerenal, intrinsic renal, or postrenal. The initial workup includes a patient history to identify the use of nephrotoxic medications or systemic illnesses that might cause poor renal perfusion or directly impair renal function. Physical examination should assess intravascular volume status and identify skin rashes indicative of systemic illness. The initial laboratory evaluation should include measurement of serum creatinine level, complete blood count, urinalysis, and fractional excretion of sodium. Ultrasonography of the kidneys should be performed in most patients, particularly in older men, to rule out obstruction. Management of acute kidney injury involves fluid resuscitation, avoidance of nephrotoxic medications and contrast media exposure, and correction of electrolyte imbalances. Renal replacement therapy (dialysis) is indicated for refractory hyperkalemia; volume overload; intractable acidosis; uremic encephalopathy, pericarditis, or pleuritis; and removal of certain toxins. Recognition of risk factors (e.g., older age, sepsis, hypovolemia/shock, cardiac surgery, infusion of contrast agents, diabetes mellitus, preexisting chronic kidney disease, cardiac failure, liver failure) is important. Team-based approaches for prevention, early diagnosis, and aggressive management are critical for improving outcomes.

### Diagnosis, epidemiology and outcomes of acute kidney injury [^117E7Dec]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2008). Low credibility.

Acute kidney injury is an increasingly common and potentially catastrophic complication in hospitalized patients. Early observational studies from the 1980s and 1990s established the general epidemiologic features of acute kidney injury: the incidence, prognostic significance, and predisposing medical and surgical conditions. Recent multicenter observational cohorts and administrative databases have enhanced our understanding of the overall disease burden of acute kidney injury and trends in its epidemiology. An increasing number of clinical studies focusing on specific types of acute kidney injury (e.g., in the setting of intravenous contrast, sepsis, and major surgery) have provided further details into this heterogeneous syndrome. Despite our sophisticated understanding of the epidemiology and pathobiology of acute kidney injury, current prevention strategies are inadequate and current treatment options outside of renal replacement therapy are nonexistent. This failure to innovate may be due in part to a diagnostic approach that has stagnated for decades and continues to rely on markers of glomerular filtration (blood urea nitrogen and creatinine) that are neither sensitive nor specific. There has been increasing interest in the identification and validation of novel biomarkers of acute kidney injury that may permit earlier and more accurate diagnosis. This review summarizes the major epidemiologic studies of acute kidney injury and efforts to modernize the approach to its diagnosis.

Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2012). Low credibility.

Rationale

In the past, a myriad of definitions for acute renal failure and AKI existed in parallel, making comparison of results difficult. In the KDIGO Clinical Practice Guidelines for AKI, definition and staging of AKI is based on a combination of the Risk, Injury, Failure; Loss, End-Stage Renal Disease (RIFLE) and Acute Kidney Injury Network (AKIN) criteria. Both criteria rely on GFR, and its proxy serum creatinine, and urinary output as the most useful overall indices of acute changes of kidney function. Changes in serum creatinine concentration and/or urine output are used as surrogates for acute changes in kidney function. The recommended diagnostic criteria establish a solid ground for standardized AKI assessment and classification in everyday clinical practice as well as in research conditions. As such, ERBP considers them as a good starting point towards a more standardized approach to AKI definition and particularly for the assessment of the predictive power of AKI with respect to overall and renal outcome (staging of severity). However, ERBP wants to update and fine-tune the classification by specifically underscoring and more extensively clarifying (i) the need to use the first available (admission) serum creatinine in that episode as baseline creatinine; and (ii) draw attention to the fact that urinary volume should be expressed using ideal body weight rather than real body weight when calculating the urinary output in mL/min/kg. ERBP also felt that it was necessary to explicitly state that both criteria should be applied to classify patients. Indeed, after publication of the RIFLE criteria, it became rapidly apparent that different interpretations were still given to 'baseline creatinine', and that the urinary output criterion was either omitted, or calculated on 24-h urine output. For baseline creatinine, some authors suggested using an estimation of serum creatinine, by backward calculation from a presumed 'standard GFR' of 75 mL/min/1.73 m²; others suggested using the last known value. This concept of a 'universal baseline' clashes with the current epidemiology of AKI, where an important subpopulation do not start from 'normal renal function', but do already have underlying CKD. Siew et al. demonstrated that the use of the value at admission in the episode under consideration was best associated with risk. Also in the AKIN criteria, the intention is to use the evolution of serum creatinine relative to the first observed value in that episode. It was demonstrated that using admission creatinine rather than estimated creatinine from a presumed GFR of 75 mL/min improved the prediction of need for renal replacement therapy and mortality, and decreased misclassification. ERBP wants to stress that the use of estimated GFR (eGFR), using whatever formula, is obsolete in patients with AKI, as all these formulae presume that kidney function is stable, and markers of GFR are in steady state, which is of course contradictory with the fact that patients have AKI.

KDIGO/KDOQI AKI definition, staging, and performance measures — the definition and staging system provides an important tool for epidemiologic studies and trial design, but there is insufficient validation for its use in diagnosis and clinical management, and we do not believe that there are sufficient data to support use of the stage-based management approach; rather, management of patients with AKI should be based on assessment of overall clinical status; although AKI is an important risk factor for CKD, the majority of patients with mild, readily reversible AKI are at relatively low risk of progressive CKD; from a U.S. public health standpoint, follow-up should be targeted to the highest risk populations; the KDIGO recommendations for definition and staging of adult AKI should not be used for the development of clinical performance measures, and administrative coding for AKI should not be based solely on this definition and staging system.

### The impact of biomarkers of acute kidney injury on individual patient care [^112kmnFc]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2020). Medium credibility.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) remains a common clinical syndrome associated with increased morbidity and mortality. In the last several years there have been several advances in the identification of patients at increased risk for AKI through the use of traditional and newer functional and damage biomarkers of AKI. This article will specifically focus on the impact of biomarkers of AKI on individual patient care, focusing predominantly on the markers with the most expansive breadth of study in patients and reported literature evidence. Several studies have demonstrated that close monitoring of widely available biomarkers such as serum creatinine and urine output is strongly associated with improved patient outcomes. An integrated approach to these biomarkers used in context with patient risk factors (identifiable using electronic health record monitoring) and with tests of renal reserve may guide implementation and targeting of care bundles to optimize patient care. Besides traditional functional markers, biochemical injury biomarkers have been increasingly utilized in clinical trials both as a measure of kidney injury as well as a trigger to initiate other treatment options (e.g. care bundles and novel therapies). As the novel measures are becoming globally available, the clinical implementation of hospital-based real-time biomarker measurements involves a multidisciplinary approach.

### Before you call renal: acute kidney injury for hospitalists [^115kZHtU]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Acute kidney injury is a clinical problem of growing incidence in hospitalized patients. It increases the risk of poor outcomes, length of stay and the cost of hospitalization. Successful management of acute kidney injury requires early recognition and diagnosis through detailed medical history, careful physical exam, judicious use of laboratory and radiologic tests and timely renal consultation. Subsequent management is tailored to the likely mechanism of injury with emphasis on limiting both further injury and systemic consequences. A common sense approach to acute kidney injury is essential for hospitalists aiming to limit further injury, prevent acute complications and lessen the risk of chronic morbidity.

Regarding inpatient care for acute kidney injury, more specifically with respect to renal function monitoring, patients at risk for AKI, UKKA 2019 guidelines recommend to confirm the presence of an active episode of AKI occurring in secondary care based on frequent serum creatinine testing (such as at 12 and 24 hours after the index value) when the true, reference serum creatinine is uncertain.

Background

The patterns, performance characteristics, and yield of diagnostic tests ordered for the evaluation of acute kidney injury (AKI) have not been rigorously evaluated.

Methods

We characterized the frequency of AKI diagnostic testing for urine, blood, radiology, and pathology tests in all adult inpatients who were admitted with or developed AKI (N = 4903 patients with 5731 AKI episodes) during a single calendar year. We assessed the frequency of abnormal test results overall and by AKI stage. We manually reviewed electronic medical records to evaluate the diagnostic yield of selected urine, blood, and radiology tests. Diagnostic yield of urine and blood tests was determined based on whether an abnormal test affected AKI diagnosis or management, whereas diagnostic yield of radiology tests was based on whether an abnormal test resulted in a procedural intervention. In sensitivity analyses we also evaluated appropriateness of testing using prespecified criteria.

Results

Frequency of testing increased with higher AKI stage for nearly all diagnostic tests, whereas frequency of detecting an abnormal result increased for some, but not all, tests. Frequency of detecting an abnormal result was highly variable across tests, ranging from 0% for anti-glomerular basement membrane testing to 71% for urine protein testing. Many of the tests evaluated had low diagnostic yield. In particular, selected urine and blood tests were unlikely to impact AKI diagnosis or management, whereas radiology tests had greater clinical utility.

Conclusions

In patients with AKI, many of the diagnostic tests performed, even when positive or abnormal, may have limited clinical utility.

Challenges of diagnosing AKI in critically ill patients

As outlined earlier, the use of serum creatinine to estimate GFR in critically ill patients is limited by the lack of steady-state conditions, unpredictable rate of production, and variable degree of elimination (Table 2). Medications may cause increases in creatinine without reflecting a true decrease in GFR and fluid overload may lead to a dilution of creatinine concentrations. Finally, serum creatinine substantially lags behind a reduction in GFR and thus does not provide a useful real-time assessment of GFR. It is therefore not surprising that AKI is often diagnosed late in critically ill patients.

The interpretation of additional diagnostic investigations can be challenging, too. Dipstick haematuria is not uncommon in patients with an indwelling urinary catheter and most commonly due to simple trauma. Even more specialised tests, like autoimmune tests, have a higher risk of false-positive results in critically ill patients. For instance, infection is a frequent cause of a false-positive ANCA result. Until more reliable tests are routinely used in clinical practice it is essential to interpret creatinine results and other diagnostic tests within the clinical context.

Future diagnostic tools

A variety of new functional and damage markers of AKI have been shown to provide information related to the underlying pathophysiology of AKI and may also be utilised as diagnostic tools. It is expected that some of these markers will be routinely integrated into the definition as well as diagnostic workup of AKI.

Achieving the ability to rapidly and accurately measure and monitor GFR in real time would be very beneficial, especially in the ICU. Several groups are developing optical measurement techniques using minimally invasive or non-invasive techniques that can quantify renal function independent of serum creatinine or urine output. In the past few years, significant progress has been made in using two-photon excitation fluorescence microscopy to study kidney function. It is very likely that several of these approaches will enter clinical phase studies in the very near future. These techniques will enable an earlier diagnosis of AKI and also provide opportunities to improve clinical management, including the use of nephrotoxic substances and appropriate drug dosing.

New imaging techniques may also be utilised, including cine phase-contrast magnetic resonance imaging or intravital multiphoton studies. However, given the complexity, financial costs, and need for patient transport, it is likely that they will remain research tools.

### KDIGO 2024 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and management of chronic kidney disease [^115G7uxM]. Kidney International (2024). High credibility.

KDIGO 2024 chronic kidney disease (CKD) chronicity assessment — differentiating CKD from acute kidney disorders emphasizes that the major challenge for defining chronicity is to differentiate CKD from acute kidney diseases (AKDs) such as acute glomerulonephritis (GN), including acute kidney injury (AKI), which may require different timelines for initiation of treatments, different interventions, and have different etiologies and outcomes. The duration of kidney disease may be documented or inferred based on the clinical context; for example, a person with decreased GFR or kidney damage during an acute illness, without prior documentation of kidney disease, may be inferred to have AKD, and resolution over days to weeks would confirm the diagnosis of AKI. A person with similar findings in the absence of an acute illness may be inferred to have CKD and, if followed over time, would be confirmed to have CKD. In both cases, repeat ascertainment of GFR and kidney damage is recommended for accurate diagnosis and staging, and the timing of the evaluation depends on clinical judgment, with earlier evaluation for those suspected of having AKI and later evaluation for those suspected of having CKD. For people with risk factors for CKD, delaying diagnosis for the sake of confirming chronicity can delay care, and initiating treatment both allows for earlier intervention and also indicates to people the importance of the disease.

### KDIGO clinical practice guidelines for acute kidney injury [^1116FBxo]. Nephron: Clinical Practice (2012). Medium credibility.

KDIGO acute kidney injury evaluation and stage-based management — Initial assessment, monitoring, nephrotoxin exposure, hemodynamic assessment, and chronic kidney disease (CKD) risk management are outlined as follows: Laboratory parameters — including SCr, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and electrolytes, complete blood count and differential — should be obtained, and urine analysis and microscopic examination as well as urinary chemistries may be helpful in determining the underlying cause of AKI; imaging tests, especially ultrasound, are important components of the evaluation for patients with AKI. Individualize frequency and duration of monitoring based on patient risk, exposure and clinical course, and it is advisable to tailor management to AKI stage. While stage-based actions provide a starting point, they are neither complete nor mandatory for an individual patient, and the measurement of urine output does not imply that the urinary bladder catheterization is mandatory for all patients. Nephrotoxic drugs account for some part of AKI in 20–30% of patients, and it seems prudent to limit exposure to these agents whenever possible and to weigh the risk of developing or worsening AKI against the risk associated with not using the agent. To ensure adequate circulating blood volume, static variables like central venous pressure are not nearly as useful as dynamic variables, such as pulse-pressure variation, inferior vena cava filling by ultrasound and echocardiographic appearance of the heart. Since AKI is a risk factor for CKD, it is important to evaluate patients with AKI for new onset or worsening of pre-existing CKD; if patients have CKD, manage patients as detailed in the KDOQI CKD Guideline (Guidelines 7–15), and if patients do not have CKD, consider them to be at increased risk for CKD and care for them as detailed in the KDIGO CKD Guideline 3 for patients at increased risk for CKD.
