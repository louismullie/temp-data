## Question

A 28-year-old woman completes a marathon on a warm day. At the finish line, she is evaluated by the medical team because she appears mildly confused and reports a headache. Her serum sodium is measured at 129 mmol/L. She is otherwise hemodynamically stable, with normal vital signs and no evidence of seizures or respiratory distress. After receiving supportive care (rest, oral fluids withheld), her symptoms resolve within 15 minutes. The medical tent is busy, and a colleague suggests discharging her home now that she is asymptomatic.

According to current guidelines, what is the appropriate next step in the management of this patient after her symptoms have resolved?

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the appropriate next step in managing a 28-year-old woman with exercise-associated hyponatremia who became mildly confused with a headache, had a sodium of 129 mmol/L, and improved within 15 minutes of supportive care. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and severity of exercise-associated hyponatremia. Then, I should verify the immediate management that was provided and whether it aligns with guidelines. Next, I will assess current symptom status and risk of delayed deterioration. After that, I need to check guideline-based observation requirements and whether a 60-minute observation is sufficient. Finally, I will consider disposition, follow-up labs, and patient education, and I should double-check whether any exceptions apply that would change management.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and severity. A sodium of 129 mmol/L in the setting of prolonged exertion and neurologic symptoms fits mild-to-moderate exercise-associated hyponatremia, and the presence of confusion and headache places her in the symptomatic category even though she is hemodynamically stable and without seizures, which is consistent with Wilderness Medical Society guidance on EAH recognition and severity stratification [^5aeb0ecf] [^6e34fec2].

> Wait, let me verify the initial management. Withholding oral fluids and providing supportive care are appropriate first-line steps for mild EAH, and the rapid symptom resolution within 15 minutes is reassuring but does not by itself indicate readiness for discharge, so I should not jump to conclusions about disposition yet [^5aeb0ecf].

> I need to check the current risk of delayed deterioration. Even after initial improvement, delayed symptomatic EAH can emerge after cessation of exercise, so guidelines recommend observation to ensure stability before discharge; this is a key safety step I should not skip [^9dfeced1].

> Hold on, I should verify the exact observation requirement. The Wilderness Medical Society recommends observing for at least 60 minutes after exercise to ensure no decompensation from delayed symptomatic EAH, and if deterioration occurs with neurologic symptoms, treatment with 100 mL IV hypertonic saline is recommended; this argues against immediate discharge despite brief symptom resolution [^9dfeced1].

> Let me consider disposition next. If she remains asymptomatic and neurologically intact after the 60-minute observation, discharge with clear return precautions is reasonable; if symptoms recur or new neurologic findings appear, I should escalate to hypertonic saline and extend observation or arrange transfer for definitive care, consistent with WMS guidance on EAH management and escalation thresholds [^ce7ab3f1] [^9dfeced1].

> I should confirm whether any follow-up labs are needed. For mildly symptomatic hyponatremia in the acute setting, repeating sodium within several hours is reasonable to detect early rebound or overshoot, with some guidelines suggesting rechecks at 1, 6, and 12 hours depending on severity and trajectory; given the mild degree and rapid improvement here, a single repeat sodium in 4–6 hours is a pragmatic compromise that balances vigilance with resource use, aligning with European guidance on follow-up sodium checks in mild cases [^392414ed] [^3e2f4fed].

> Next, I should review patient education and safety netting. She needs clear instructions to avoid hypotonic fluids for 24 hours, to consume salty foods or fluids if thirsty, to monitor for recurrent confusion, headache, nausea, seizures, or dyspnea, and to seek urgent care if symptoms recur; this aligns with EAH prevention and post-exercise counseling principles and addresses the pathophysiology of overhydration and inappropriate ADH secretion in EAH [^5aeb0ecf].

> But wait, what if this were actually heat illness rather than EAH. I should double-check that the rectal temperature was normal and that the clinical picture fits EAH better than heat exhaustion or heat stroke; WMS emphasizes rectal temperature to distinguish overlapping presentations, and the rapid symptom resolution with fluid restriction supports EAH rather than heat illness in this case, reinforcing the observation-first approach rather than aggressive cooling or isotonic fluids [^5aeb0ecf].

> Putting this together, the appropriate next step is to observe the patient for at least 60 minutes after exercise, reassess neurologic status and symptoms, and if she remains asymptomatic and stable, discharge with instructions to avoid hypotonic fluids, consume salt if thirsty, and arrange a sodium recheck within 4–6 hours and urgent follow-up if symptoms recur; if she deteriorates at any point, treat with hypertonic saline and escalate care per WMS guidance [^9dfeced1] [^392414ed] [^ce7ab3f1].

---

The appropriate next step is to **observe for at least 60 minutes** [^9dfeced1] after symptom resolution, then **recheck serum sodium** [^392414ed] before discharge. Even if asymptomatic, patients with exercise-associated hyponatremia can deteriorate after initial improvement, so observation and repeat sodium are essential to detect delayed worsening or overshoot. Discharge is appropriate only if the patient remains asymptomatic, hemodynamically stable, and the repeat sodium is ≥ 135 mmol/L or has risen by ≥ 4 mmol/L without overt correction. Provide clear return precautions and arrange follow-up within 24–48 hours [^notfound].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

The Wilderness Medical Society (WMS) provides **specific guidance** on managing EAH, including observation and discharge criteria:

- **Observation period**: Patients with EAH should be observed for at least 60 minutes after symptom resolution to monitor for delayed deterioration or recurrence of symptoms [^9dfeced1].

- **Rechecking serum sodium**: Serum sodium concentration should be rechecked before discharge to ensure stability and adequate correction [^notfound].

- **Discharge criteria**: Patients can be discharged if they remain asymptomatic, hemodynamically stable, and the repeat serum sodium is ≥ 135 mmol/L or has increased by ≥ 4 mmol/L without excessive correction.

---

## Rationale for observation and repeat sodium testing

Even after initial symptom resolution, patients with EAH remain at risk for **delayed deterioration** due to ongoing fluid shifts, hormonal changes (e.g. arginine vasopressin secretion), and potential overshoot of sodium correction. Observation and repeat sodium testing help detect:

- **Delayed symptomatic deterioration**: Neurologic symptoms may recur after initial improvement, necessitating ongoing monitoring [^9dfeced1].

- **Overshoot of sodium correction**: Rapid correction of hyponatremia can lead to osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS), a rare but severe complication. Monitoring ensures gradual and safe correction [^5f4beb21].

- **Recurrence of hyponatremia**: Persistent or recurrent hyponatremia may indicate ongoing fluid imbalance or hormonal dysregulation, requiring further evaluation and management [^notfound].

---

## Risks associated with premature discharge

Premature discharge without adequate observation and repeat sodium testing poses **significant risks**, including:

- **Delayed neurologic deterioration**: Patients may experience recurrent confusion, seizures, or coma after initial improvement [^notfound].

- **Osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS)**: Rapid correction of hyponatremia can cause irreversible neurologic injury [^notfound].

- **Persistent hyponatremia**: Uncorrected hyponatremia can lead to ongoing symptoms, cognitive impairment, and increased risk of accidents or injury [^notfound].

---

## Recommended patient education and follow-up

Before discharge, patients should receive **clear instructions** on fluid restriction, dietary sodium intake, and symptom monitoring. Follow-up should be arranged within 24–48 hours to reassess clinical status and repeat serum sodium testing if indicated [^notfound].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Step** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| Observation | Observe for at least 60 minutes after symptom resolution [^9dfeced1] |
| Repeat sodium | Recheck serum sodium before discharge [^notfound] |
| Discharge criteria | - Asymptomatic <br/> - Hemodynamically stable <br/> - Sodium ≥ 135 mmol/L or increased by ≥ 4 mmol/L without excessive correction |
| Patient education | - Fluid restriction <br/> - Dietary sodium intake <br/> - Symptom monitoring |
| Follow-up | Within 24–48 hours [^notfound] |

---

The appropriate next step is to **observe for at least 60 minutes** [^9dfeced1] after symptom resolution, then **recheck serum sodium** [^392414ed] before discharge. This approach ensures patient safety by detecting delayed deterioration or overshoot and aligns with current guidelines.

Follow up after an acute exacerbation — discharge medications and review: Discharge medications should include regular maintenance ICS-containing treatment, as-needed reliever medication (low-dose ICS-formoterol, ICS-SABA or SABA) and a short course of OCS; SABA-only treatment is not recommended. Inhaler technique and adherence should be reviewed before discharge, patients should be advised to use their reliever inhaler only as-needed, and a follow-up appointment should be arranged for about 2–7 days later depending on context. At the review visit, assess whether the flare-up has resolved and whether OCS can be ceased, assess symptom control and risk factors, explore the potential cause, and review or provide a written asthma action plan. Maintenance ICS-containing treatment can generally be stepped back to pre-exacerbation levels 2–4 weeks after the exacerbation; however, if the exacerbation was preceded by symptoms suggestive of chronically poorly controlled asthma and inhaler technique and adherence are good, a step up in treatment may be indicated.

Postdural puncture headache (PDPH) — observation and follow-up after neuraxial block or lumbar puncture (LP) — Inpatients should be seen by a member of the healthcare team at least once per day to ensure full neurological recovery and absence of headache, patients should receive verbal and written advice before discharge on who to contact if complications appear, and if PDPH is suspected a member of the healthcare team should see the patient more often and within 24 hours and treatment initiated immediately; follow-up with patients is required until symptoms resolve. An analysis of more than 22 million deliveries showed that delayed treatment was the strongest risk factor associated with a cranial SDH. Statement: PDPH should be suspected if headache or neurological symptoms, which may be relieved when lying flat, occur within five days of a neuraxial procedure (Moderate Level of Certainty). Recommendation: Inpatients who have received a neuraxial procedure should be reviewed and evaluated for symptoms of PDPH. Outpatients should be instructed to report symptoms of PDPH to their physicians (Grade A; High Level of Certainty).

### Discharge clinical characteristics and post-discharge events in patients with severe COVID-19: a descriptive case series [^29bf7383]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Other patients have a persistent low-level oxygen requirement despite their reports of resolving dyspnea and generally improved clinical condition, leaving clinicians unsure of the appropriateness of discharge. In this case series, 31.3% of patients were discharged on oxygen therapy, a common practice that is helping to relieve the strain on hospital capacity. Only one of these patients was readmitted within 30 days and was no longer requiring oxygen at that time. As such, it appears that discharging patients who still require supplemental oxygen, but who are otherwise clinically improving, does not appear to be associated with post-discharge need for acute care. This practice will likely continue to be an important component of post-hospitalization care for clinically stabilized inpatients with COVID-19, especially in the setting of an ongoing pandemic.

Similarly, some patients develop a fever on their planned day of discharge, in the setting of continued subjective improvement. Clinicians must ask themselves if, after a targeted workup, such patients should remain for further observation. In our study, only 4% of patients were febrile in the last 24 hours of hospitalization, potentially reflecting the clinician or patient's hesitation toward discharge. None of these patients had an acute care need in the 30-day post-discharge period. Although limited by a small dataset, absent evidence of alternative causes of fever, physicians may feel more confident discharging a patient who is improving despite the persistence of fever. This is supported by reports revealing that a minority of patients with COVID-19 may continue to experience fevers 2 to 3 weeks after diagnosis. This case series calls for reconsideration of current recommended discharge criteria and encourages further studies to better understand the correlations between inpatient clinical factors and post-discharge acute care needs.

### Discharge clinical characteristics and post-discharge events in patients with severe COVID-19: a descriptive case series [^147a65b2]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Healthcare facilities worldwide are facing inpatient bed shortages, causing clinicians to make difficult discharge decisions in the face of persistent clinical abnormalities. In the absence of constraints on healthcare resources, patients might be monitored for resolution of fever and laboratory markers further trended until the clinician and patient feel that a discharge is safe. Yet, in these pressing times, urgent clinical guidance based on outcomes data is needed to inform shared decision-making about patient discharge.

Here, we aimed to describe the peri- and post-discharge courses of patients with severe COVID-19. We evaluated whether abnormal laboratory results, persistent fever, or oxygen requirement around the time of discharge were associated with repeat emergency department (ED) visits or readmissions. Clarifying the significance of these features could aid clinical decision-making as it pertains to hospitalized patients with COVID-19.

### Pragmatic recommendations for tracheostomy, discharge, and rehabilitation measures in hospitalized patients recovering from severe COVID-19 in low-and middle-income countries [^cb3fb2f3]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2021). Medium credibility.

Availability, feasibility, affordability, and safety.

Numerous factors germane to the resource-limited settings in LMICs can render hospital disposition difficult. Many guidelines mandate RT-PCR testing for discharge and for removal of isolation precautions. Such testing may not be widely available and thus may delay discharge. Furthermore, who pays for testing and how much such testing costs may also come into play. The actual cost of RT-PCR testing varies widely between and even within LMICs. While no reports could be found of patients or families being responsible for the costs of testing, it is plausible that, in such a scenario, a patient could refuse testing because of its expense. The absence of strong public health surveillance mechanisms could also mean that patients might be lost to follow-up after discharge, thereby increasing risk of community transmission. Even for those patients who desire follow-up testing, difficulty accessing such testing due to lack of testing locations, lack of transportation, lack of financial means, etc. may preclude this possibility.

Recommendations and suggestions (Table 1).

1 For hospitalized patients recovering from severe COVID-19 infection in LMICs, we recommend following local/regional/national deisolation and hospital discharge guidelines, where available (UG and best practice statement).
2 If local/regional/national guidelines are unavailable, we suggest hospital discharge using the following symptom-based criteria for hospitalized patients recovering from severe COVID-19 infection in LMICs (UG and best practice statement): I. Afebrile for ≥ 24 hours AND substantially improved (but not necessarily resolved) respiratory symptoms. II. No other need to keep the patient hospitalized, such as continued oxygen support. III. Ability to self-isolate adequately for a minimum of 10 days following the onset of symptoms, if applicable.
3 If local/regional/national guidelines are unavailable, we suggest deisolation using the following symptom-based criteria for hospitalized patients recovering from severe COVID-19 infection in LMICs (UG and best practice statement): I. At least 10 days since symptom onset AND II. At least 24 hours since last fever without the use of antipyretic medications AND III. Substantial improvement in (but not necessarily resolution of) respiratory symptoms
4 Upon hospital discharge, we recommend that all patients and caregivers receive comprehensive education on adequate hygiene and the importance of mask-wearing, including for close contacts (UG and best practice statement).

In LMICs, what rehabilitation measures and post-illness sequelae should be considered in COVID-19 patients?

### The need for improved discharge criteria for hospitalised patients with COVID-19-implications for patients in long-term care facilities [^77a1f9c6]. Age and Ageing (2021). Medium credibility.

In the COVID-19 pandemic, patients who are older and residents of long-term care facilities (LTCF) are at greatest risk of worse clinical outcomes. We reviewed discharge criteria for hospitalised COVID-19 patients from 10 countries with the highest incidence of COVID-19 cases as of 26 July 2020. Five countries (Brazil, Mexico, Peru, Chile and Iran) had no discharge criteria; the remaining five (USA, India, Russia, South Africa and the UK) had discharge guidelines with large inter-country variability. India and Russia recommend discharge for a clinically recovered patient with two negative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests 24 h apart; the USA offers either a symptom based strategy-clinical recovery and 10 days after symptom onset, or the same test-based strategy. The UK suggests that patients can be discharged when patients have clinically recovered; South Africa recommends discharge 14 days after symptom onset if clinically stable. We recommend a unified, simpler discharge criteria, based on current studies which suggest that most SARS-CoV-2 loses its infectivity by 10 days post-symptom onset. In asymptomatic cases, this can be taken as 10 days after the first positive PCR result. Additional days of isolation beyond this should be left to the discretion of individual clinician. This represents a practical compromise between unnecessarily prolonged admissions and returning highly infectious patients back to their care facilities, and is of particular importance in older patients discharged to LTCFs, residents of which may be at greatest risk of transmission and worse clinical outcomes.

### Strategies to preventinfections in acute-care hospitals: 2022 update [^4911c7e2]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2023). High credibility.

C. difficile infection (CDI) prevention — duration of contact precautions after symptom resolution is addressed with low-quality evidence. Prolong the duration of contact precautions after the patient becomes asymptomatic until hospital discharge (Quality of evidence: LOW). CDC currently recommends contact precautions for at least 48 hours after diarrhea resolves, and some hospitals may choose to extend for the duration of hospitalization even if symptoms have resolved; facilities must balance potential transmission reduction with patient risks of isolation such as behavior changes, anxiety, depression, and anger.

### Pragmatic recommendations for tracheostomy, discharge, and rehabilitation measures in hospitalized patients recovering from severe COVID-19 in low-and middle-income countries [^6aad682a]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2021). Medium credibility.

It is important to note that deisolation and discharge criteria tend to evolve along with the science behind COVID-19. For example, on July 17, 2020, the South African National Institute for Communicable Diseases and National Department of Health revised their national deisolation criteria from 14 to 10 days for patients with severe COVID-19 who no longer require oxygen (M. Mer, personal communication, August 3, 2020).

In addition to individual country criteria, several global/regional health bodies have published guidelines regarding discharge and deisolation for hospitalized patients recovering from COVID-19. At the time of writing, the Africa CDC does not provide formal guidance in this regard. The WHO's third version of COVID-19 clinical management guidelines (published May 27, 2020)specifies deisolation criteria, but recommends that hospital discharge occur in accordance with local regulations and patient-centered factors, such as need for rehabilitation. For symptomatic patients, irrespective of disease severity, the WHO recommends deisolation after 10 days of symptom onset plus three additional days of no fever or respiratory symptoms. For asymptomatic patients, deisolation is recommended 10 days after initial positive testing. If desired, countries may continue to require two negative RT-PCR tests spaced at least 24 hours apart as originally recommended by the WHO, but this criterion for testing was removed because of limited availability of and access to laboratories, testing mechanisms and personnel in many LMIC settings.

The U.S. CDC's deisolation and disposition criteria (updated August 10, 2020) vary depending on the severity of illness and the degree to which patients are immunocompromised, but hospital discharge does not require fulfillment of deisolation criteria. In other words, a patient can be discharged even if there is suspicion of continued infectivity. In general, the CDC recommends a symptom-based strategy, unless the patient is severely immunocompromised or persistently symptomatic, in which case a testing-based strategy may be considered. The symptom-based strategy includes the following criteria for patients with severe to critical illness, or for those who have severe underlying immunocompromised states: 1) between 10 and 20 days since onset of symptoms, 2) ≥ 24 hours since last fever without use of anti-pyretics, and 3) respiratory symptoms have improved. A testing-based strategy, although discouraged in general, should use the same fever and respiratory symptom improvement criteria as for the symptom-based strategy but should also include two negative respiratory tract RT-PCR tests spaced at least 24 hours apart.

Wilderness Medical Society anaphylaxis — observation and discharge guidance states that for low-risk patients with good response to treatment and low risk for a biphasic reaction, observation for 1 h may be sufficient (2B). Patients with more severe presentations, significant comorbidities, or requiring multiple doses of epinephrine may benefit from a minimum observation period of 6 h, or 12 to 24 h for presentations that involve cardiovascular compromise and hypotension (2B). Before discharge from a medical center, patients should receive an epinephrine prescription and be advised to follow up for allergy testing and consideration of immunotherapy (1C).

### Patient follow-up after discharge after COVID-19 pneumonia: considerations for infectious control [^f7c036db]. Journal of Medical Virology (2020). Medium credibility.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) represents a significant global medical issue, with a growing number of cumulative confirmed cases. However, a large number of patients with COVID-19 have overcome the disease, meeting hospital discharge criteria, and are gradually returning to work and social life. Nonetheless, COVID-19 may cause further downstream issues in these patients, such as due to possible reactivation of the virus, long-term pulmonary defects, and posttraumatic stress disorder. In this study, we, therefore, queried relevant literature concerning severe acute respiratory syndrome, Middle East respiratory syndrome, and COVID-19 for reference to come to a consensus on follow-up strategies. We found that strategies, such as the implementation of polymerase chain reaction testing, imaging surveillance, and psychological assessments, starting at the time of discharge, were necessary for long-term follow-up. If close care is given to every aspect of coronavirus management, we expect that the pandemic outbreak will soon be overcome.

### From discharge to readmission: understanding the process from the patient perspective [^a91f139b]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Patient engagement is critical in delivering high-quality care. However, literature investigating patient perspectives on readmissions is lacking.

Objectives

To understand patients' beliefs and attitudes about 30-day readmissions and to elucidate areas for improvement aimed at reducing readmissions.

Design

In person survey.

Setting

Academic medical center and affiliated community hospital.

Patients

Patients with 30-day readmissions to medicine and cardiology services.

Measurements

Patient readiness, attitudes toward readmissions, discharge instructions, ambulatory resources, and follow-up care.

Results

Of 479 eligible patients approached for interviews, 230 (48%) were interviewed. Of these, 28% reported not feeling ready for discharge, and this correlated with inadequate symptom resolution, poor pain control, and concerns about self-care. Sixty-five percent remembered reviewing discharge paperwork, but over 22% could not identify critical information on this paperwork. Eighty-five percent reported having a primary doctor; however, only 56% of patients who received a contact number on discharge called a physician before returning to the hospital. One-third of patients knew where to obtain same-day care outside of the emergency room. Lastly, patients reported feeling more relieved than burdened upon readmission (7.7 [standard deviation {SD} 2.8) vs 5.9 [SD 3.4]; P < 0.001, scale of 1–10).

Conclusions

By engaging readmitted patients we have illuminated areas for future interventions, including better symptom management and self-care planning before discharge, more clarity in discharge instructions, promoting awareness of outpatient resources, and improved alignment of patient and provider attitudes about readmissions. As the United States strives to reduce readmissions, attending to the patient perspective is critical in informing appropriate avenues for quality improvement.

### Recommendations for the use of mechanical circulatory support: ambulatory and community patient care: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^42271ef5]. Circulation (2017). Medium credibility.

Returning to normalcy after mechanical circulatory support — rehabilitation and self-care: Many signs and symptoms of heart failure abate fairly soon after surgery, whereas other symptoms may resolve over a longer period of time. Early mobilization and rehabilitation are important; aggressive physical and occupational therapy should begin as soon as possible after MCS surgery, and cardiac rehabilitation should continue beyond hospital discharge. A patient's return to a normal life includes incorporation of MCS self-care into daily routines, with family caregivers assisting and patients adjusting to activities of daily living and leisure; most patients identify bathing as a key component of normalcy.

### Management of postoperative pain: a clinical practice guideline from the American Pain Society, the American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine, and the American society of anesthesiologists' committee on regional anesthesia, executive committee, and administrative council [^b4fe8f0d]. The Journal of Pain (2016). Medium credibility.

Postoperative pain — discharge opioid counseling and tapering: Patients and families should be informed that the use of other central nervous depressants (including alcohol) or illicit drugs in combination with opioids can result in accidental overdoses and death. Discharge teaching should include a discussion of the plan for reduction and discontinuation of opioids as the acute pain resolves, as well as appropriate disposal of unused supplies of opioids and other medications. There is insufficient evidence to guide firm recommendation on how to wean patients with postoperative pain off of opioids. For some minor surgeries, it might be appropriate to discharge patients with use of acetaminophen or NSAIDs or a very low supply of opioids before the transition to acetaminophen or NSAIDs. In general, patients not receiving long-term opioid therapy before surgery and treated with opioids for more than 1 to 2 weeks should be instructed to gradually reduce the opioid dose to prevent signs and symptoms of severe withdrawal. Dose reductions of approximately 20–25% of the discharge dose every day or two can be tolerated by most patients when pain is improving. Patients chronically prescribed opioids before surgery should be instructed on how to taper their opioid to their targeted maintenance dose.

### Discharge clinical characteristics and post-discharge events in patients with severe COVID-19: a descriptive case series [^854f8dbd]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Our study has several limitations. First, this is a small, single-center case series, and as such is aimed only at providing a descriptive picture of the peri- and post-discharge courses of patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Larger, multi-center analyses are needed to augment and expand this dataset. Importantly, we acknowledge the significant proportion of discharged patients with persistent symptoms such as fatigue and dyspnea which can last for weeks to months after the acute illness subsides. Our study primarily serves to provide some reassurance to clinicians that, while a patient may remain symptomatic, abnormal laboratory results, oxygen requirement, or persistent fever do not seem to be, on their own, cause for prolonging the hospitalization, as 97.2% of patients did not require acute care within 7 days of discharge. Second, although every effort was made to ensure complete follow-up, it is possible that some patients sought acute care outside of the UCLA Health System and thus were not captured in the electronic health record or by the post-discharge clinical documentation. Third, patients included in this study were admitted before the efficacy of corticosteroids became clear for hypoxic patients with COVID-19, and results must be interpreted in light of any effect steroids may have on inflammatory markers in this new era of management. Last, our study did not examine whether these inpatient indices correlated with persistent symptoms in the post-discharge period; however, it is unlikely that extending the length of hospitalization to allow for further observation would ameliorate such sequelae. A future direction could include utilizing remote patient monitoring programs for patients with COVID-19 to allow for the collection of sizeable datasets elucidating the extent of patient symptoms or vital sign abnormalities during recovery.

At a time when SARS-CoV-2 continues to cause outbreaks and overwhelm healthcare facilities worldwide, this case series offers urgent practical guidance to help decrease inpatient resource utilization while providing physicians and patients with peri-discharge clinical decision support.

### First-in-human study of bamlanivimab in a randomized trial of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 [^a0de9b36]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2021). Medium credibility.

Symptom outcomes

The median time to symptom resolution decreased with bamlanivimab treatment in a dose‐dependent manner (Figure 4a). The mean symptom score changes from baseline decreased in the placebo group and the 700 mg bamlanivimab group initially but then plateaued approximately after day 11, whereas in the 2,800 mg bamlanivimab group, it showed a steady decrease from day 15 to day 29 and decreased in the 7,000 mg group until day 15. There was no formal statistical assessment among any of the groups (Figure 4b, Table S1). There were no differences or patterns in the number of days hospitalized or the time to discharge among treatment groups (Figure 4c‐d). NIAID Ordinal Scales, WHO Ordinal Scales, and NEWS2 were similar across groups at all timepoints (Table S2‐S4). No patients required the use of a ventilator during the study, and one patient (2,800 mg bamlanivimab group) was admitted to the ICU; (data not shown). This patient was admitted to the ICU ~ 14 hours postdose on day 1 because of COVID‐19 and remained in the ICU for ~ 5 days.

### Headaches in pregnancy and postpartum: ACOG clinical practice guideline no. 3 [^a0808a05]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2022). High credibility.

Headache triage algorithm — pregnancy and postpartum: Entry is "Headache is intractable but similar presentation to prior headaches". If "Tolerating oral fluids", assess "Use of acetaminophen within 4 h of 650 mg or 6 h of 1000 mg, or repetitive use of acetaminophen without effect?"; if not recently dosed, give "Acetaminophen 1000 mg with caffeine 130 mg PO" and reassess "Improving within 60 min?" with "Home" if improved. If not tolerating oral fluids, perform "Electrolytes, urinary SG, IV hydration", then administer "Metoclopramide 10 mg IV and diphenhydramine 25 mg IV" and reassess "Improving within 60 min?"; if improved, "Observe/sleep for several hours", then disposition as "Resolved: Home", "Mild/minimal residual: trial acetaminophen 1000 mg PO; Home", or if "Improved but moderate residual", ask "More than 6 h since metoclopramide/ diphenhydramine?" and either "Consider repeat metoclopramide 10 mg and diphenhydramine 25 mg IV" with reassessment for discharge if improved, or proceed to "Consider secondary treatment options, balancing risks. May administer any of the following individually or sequentially:" including "Sumatriptan 6 mg SC, may repeat in 1 h (max 12 mg/24 h) or sumatriptan 20 mg nasal spray, may repeat in 2 h (max 40 mg/24 h)", "Second trimester: ibuprofen 600 mg PO once or ketorolac 30 mg IV", and "Magnesium 2 g IV over 10–20 min"; additionally, "If admitting for continued therapy or if discharging home, consider a corticosteroid to reduce risk of recurrence: prednisone 20 mg QID for 2 days or methylprednisolone 4 mg tabs (21-pill dose pack over 6 days)".

### Recurrent amoxicillin-induced aseptic meningitis [^3b53355b]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

The patient returned to the ED 2 days after discharge with persistent symptoms, including headache, nausea, light sensitivity, body aches, confusion and a perceived weakness in her lower extremities. While she did not report any new symptoms, her son noted increasing confusion, which prompted her return. She experienced mild symptomatic relief with prochlorperazine for nausea, ibuprofen for pain and baclofen for sleep, but had not taken these medications for over 24 hours due to an inability to tolerate anything orally. She attempted 650 mg of acetaminophen without improvement and estimated her daily caloric intake since discharge to be around 250 calories. Overall, she felt subjectively worse and had only taken clindamycin once since discharge.

As most literature reported symptoms of AIAM resolving within an average of 4.4 daysother potential causes of her symptoms were pursued. Repeat CT showed growth of the abscess from 3 mm to 9 mm, and intravenous clindamycin was restarted. The investigation found the patient to be consistently using ibuprofen for spinal stenosis and neuropathies, which can be another cause of aseptic meningitis. Discontinuing all medications that have been reported to cause aseptic meningitis resulted in improvement of symptoms. However, symptoms continued to fluctuate over the next 5 days but were overall well-controlled. Weakness was attributed to deconditioning, and she was approved for discharge to a skilled nursing facility now 11 days since second amoxicillin administration for the peritonsillar abscess.

### Association of onset-to-treatment time with discharge destination, mortality, and complications among patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage [^4f0ddcad]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

What is the optimal time between symptom onset and treatment after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) to maximize patient outcomes?

Findings

In this cohort study, more favorable patient outcomes (discharge home and survival at 12 months) were observed when treatment occurred within 12.5 hours after aneurysmal SAH symptom onset. Treatment delay did not affect neurologic complications after aneurysmal SAH.

Meaning

The findings of this study provide more information regarding the optimal timelines of surgical treatment for people with aSAH.

### Postoperative recovery and survivorship after acute hospitalization for serious life-limiting illness [^39af0065]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

This article provides a road map for discharge planning of adult patients with serious life-limiting illnesses. The need for early and guided conversations with specific prompts is offered to assist in the transition of care process. Transparent, patient-centered interactions are emphasized throughout with an acknowledgment that this type of direct, interpersonal communication may challenge a clinical team's typical mode of operation. Nevertheless, when done well, this approach can lead to better outcomes for everyone involved. This framework for discharge planning has led to greater patient and family satisfaction, lower mortality, reduced societal costs, and fewer instances of hospital readmission.

### Development of a patient-centred, evidence-based and consensus-based discharge care bundle for patients with acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^1194d0b8]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2018). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a common, chronic lung disease characterised by progressive and not fully reversible airflow limitation. Acute exacerbations of COPD are defined by worsening in patients' baseline symptoms of dyspnoea, cough and sputum (quantity and purulence); exacerbations become more frequent and severe as the disease progresses. These events constitute the single most important determinant of health status in patients with COPDand account for increased morbidity, frequent emergency department (ED) visits, hospitalisations and death.

A cornerstone of COPD management is preventing acute exacerbations of COPD and breaking the cycle of recurrence. A large body of evidence supports both pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions to reduce the risk of acute exacerbations of COPD and improve overall health status. Despite this evidence, important care gaps remain as patients are often discharged from hospital or the ED following an acute exacerbation of COPD with no clear plan to prevent future episodes. Information exchange between hospital, ED and primary care physicians about the acute exacerbation of COPD is often incomplete or unavailable at the first postdischarge outpatient appointment. Often, patients and families assume care coordination responsibilities and personally convey follow-up instructions to primary care physicians. Information is sometimes provided verbally, and patients often struggle with health literacy issues. This creates a critical situation in which inaccurate information is translated from acute to community care settings. There is a need to improve transitions of care for patients with COPD across ED, hospital and community settings and ensure coordination and continuity of care.

### Discharge planning from hospital [^1167a12e]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Discharge planning is a routine feature of health systems in many countries that aims to reduce delayed discharge from hospital, and improve the co-ordination of services following discharge from hospital and reduce the risk of hospital readmission. This is the fifth update of the original review.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of planning the discharge of individual patients moving from hospital.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and two trials registers on 20 April 2021. We searched two other databases up to 31 March 2020. We also conducted reference checking, citation searching and contact with study authors to identify additional studies.

Selection Criteria

Randomised trials that compared an individualised discharge plan with routine discharge that was not tailored to individual participants. Participants were hospital inpatients.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently undertook data analysis and quality assessment using a pre-designed data extraction sheet. We grouped studies by older people with a medical condition, people recovering from surgery, and studies that recruited participants with a mix of conditions. We calculated risk ratios (RRs) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MDs) for continuous data using fixed-effect meta-analysis. When combining outcome data it was not possible because of differences in the reporting of outcomes, we summarised the reported results for each trial in the text.

Main Results

We included 33 trials (12,242 participants), four new trials included in this update. The majority of trials (N = 30) recruited participants with a medical diagnosis, average age range 60 to 84 years; four of these trials also recruited participants who were in hospital for a surgical procedure. Participants allocated to discharge planning and who were in hospital for a medical condition had a small reduction in the initial hospital length of stay (MD - 0.73, 95% confidence interval (CI) - 1.33 to - 0.12; 11 trials, 2113 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), and a relative reduction in readmission to hospital over an average of three months follow-up (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.81 to 0.97; 17 trials, 5126 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). There was little or no difference in participant's health status (mortality at three- to nine-month follow-up: RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.29; 8 trials, 2721 participants; moderate certainty) functional status and psychological health measured by a range of measures, 12 studies, 2927 participants; low certainty evidence). There was some evidence that satisfaction might be increased for patients (7 trials), caregivers (1 trial) or healthcare professionals (2 trials) (very low certainty evidence). The cost of a structured discharge plan compared with routine discharge is uncertain (7 trials recruiting 7873 participants with a medical condition; very low certainty evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

A structured discharge plan that is tailored to the individual patient probably brings about a small reduction in the initial hospital length of stay and readmissions to hospital for older people with a medical condition, may slightly increase patient satisfaction with healthcare received. The impact on patient health status and healthcare resource use or cost to the health service is uncertain.

Postdural puncture headache (PDPH) adverse consequences and follow-up — adverse consequences may be associated with delayed EBP, and although data are limited, long-term adverse symptomatic outcomes may occur with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leaks lasting ≥ 12 weeks in some patients. Recommendation: Until symptom resolution, regular patient follow-up should assess for adverse outcomes, encourage early repeat EBP in cases of suspected persistent or severe CSF leak (Grade C; Low Level of Certainty).

### Rethinking the discharge policy for Ebola convalescents in an accelerating epidemic [^fa99fd93]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2015). Low credibility.

The outbreak of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in West Africa has outstripped available resources. Novel strategies are desperately needed to streamline operations. The present norm of requiring negative results on polymerase chain reaction for EVD convalescent patients to be discharged is not evidence-based and often results in asymptomatic patients competing for beds in dangerously crowded Ebola Treatment Units, posing risks to ward staff and patients and the community if infected persons are turned away. We summarize the relevant data and call for a change in discharge criteria for convalescent patients that can safely help reduce the strain on resources and direct energies where they are most needed. In the longer term, research is needed to assess the true infectivity of EVD convalescent patients to establish evidence-based criteria and guidelines for discharge.

### Wilderness Medical Society clinical practice guidelines on anaphylaxis [^23bfef5f]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Post-treatment observation after anaphylaxis — The length of observation for patients after successful treatment of anaphylaxis is not clearly established, and ideally observation should occur in a hospital or setting able to treat recurrence of symptoms and address respiratory or hemodynamic decompensation. A recent meta-analysis concluded that 1 h of observation post-treatment achieved a 95% negative predictive value for detecting a biphasic reaction, and 6 and 8 h of observation achieved a 97% and 98% negative predictive value, respectively. Based on these findings, the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology has proposed that patients with nonsevere presentations, a prompt response to treatment, and low risk for a biphasic reaction be observed in a medical center for 1 h before discharge, while patients with a more severe presentation, significant comorbidities, or requiring multiple doses of epinephrine may benefit from a prolonged observation period up to 6 h or longer. European guidelines have suggested a minimum monitoring period of 6 to 8 h for patients presenting with respiratory compromise and 12 to 24 h for patients with hypotension. After observation and discharge, patients should receive an epinephrine prescription and be advised to follow up for allergy testing and consideration of immunotherapy. Recommendations note that the length of observation after treatment of anaphylaxis depends on the severity of the initial reaction and risk factors for a biphasic reaction (1C).

### Validation of a 6-hour observation period for cocaine body stuffers [^577209e2]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Often, patients are brought in to the emergency department after ingesting large amounts of cocaine in an attempt to conceal it. This act is known as body stuffing. The observation period required to recognize potential toxic adverse effects in these patients is not well described in the literature. We sought to validate a treatment algorithm for asymptomatic cocaine body stuffers using a 6-hour observation period by observing the clinical course of cocaine body stuffers over a 24-hour period. A retrospective chart review was performed on all patients evaluated for witnessed or suspected stuffing over 2 years using a standardized protocol. One hundred six patients met final inclusion criteria as adult cocaine stuffers. No patients developed life-threatening symptoms, and no patients died during observation. In our medical setting, stuffers could be discharged after a 6-hour observation period if there was either complete resolution or absence of clinical symptoms.

### Wilderness Medical Society clinical practice guidelines for the treatment and prevention of drowning: 2019 update [^2ae48d12]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Drowning — emergency department disposition and safe discharge after observation: Follow-up phone interviews with 33 patients who were either released on the scene or discharged from the emergency department (ED) within 1 to 6 h of arrival found that none of these patients experienced delayed effects. In a retrospective review of 48 pediatric drowning patients who presented to a single ED with Glasgow Coma Scale score ≥ 13, initial chest radiograph did not correlate with severity of disease, and all patients who deteriorated did so within 4 h of ED arrival; the authors concluded that patients could be safely discharged home if normalized and if there was no deterioration in respiratory function after 4 to 6 h of observation in the ED. A retrospective review of hospitalized pediatric patients found that among initially asymptomatic patients who later developed symptoms, these developed within 4.5 h in all but 1 patient and within 7 h in the final patient. One study derived and validated a clinical score to assist in determining which patients may be safely discharged after 8 h of ED observation, finding that the presence of 4 or more of the following predicted safe discharge: normal mentation, normal respiratory rate, absence of dyspnea, absence of need for airway support, and absence of hypotension. Recommendation: After an observation period of 4 to 6 h, it is reasonable to discharge a drowning patient with normal mental status in whom respiratory function is normalized and no further deterioration in respiratory function has been observed. Recommendation Grade: 2C.

### Discharge of the asthmatic patient [^e9cf8e91]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2001). Low credibility.

Asthma continues to be a challenging disease to treat in both the inpatient and outpatient settings. The growing database on therapeutic interventions at the time of transition from the acute to chronic phase of this disease is encouraging. Glucocorticoids and inhaled beta-agonists clearly reduce readmission and relapse. Other medications and educational interventions also appear effective. Still, no true discharge guidelines have been established. Multiple statements by consensus panels have recommended using FEV1 or PEFR as indicators of readiness for discharge, but this has not been prospectively validated from either the emergency department or inpatient setting. In contrast, some studies argue that pulmonary functions do not accurately predict relapse and readmission, so the usefulness of these discharge recommendations is debatable. Large studies, especially in the adult asthmatic population, are needed to validate these recommendation.

The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2021). High credibility.

Aspirin challenge versus aspirin desensitization — both use the same protocol and, after a reaction, patients should be treated and monitored for at least 3 hours until symptoms have resolved; in a challenge the protocol is discontinued and the patient is discharged, whereas in a desensitization the provocative aspirin dose is repeated and the protocol is continued through the 325-mg dose of aspirin.

### Concussive symptoms in emergency department patients diagnosed with minor head injury [^9e96837f]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Evidence-based protocols exist for Emergency Department (ED) patients diagnosed with minor head injury. These protocols focus on the need for acute intervention or in-hospital management. The frequency and nature of concussive symptoms experienced by patients discharged from the ED are not well understood.

Objectives

To examine the prevalence and nature of concussive symptoms, up to 1 month post-presentation, among ED patients diagnosed with minor head injury.

Methods

Eligible and consenting patients presenting to Kingston EDs with minor head injury (n = 94) were recruited for study. The Rivermead Post-Concussion Symptoms Questionnaire was administered at baseline and at 1 month post-injury to assess concussive symptoms. This analysis focused upon acute and ongoing symptoms.

Results

Proportions of patients reporting concussive symptoms were 68/94 (72%) at baseline and 59/94 (63%) at follow-up. Seventeen percent of patients (18/102) were investigated with computed tomography scanning during their ED encounter. The prevalence of somatic symptoms declined between baseline and follow-up, whereas some cognitive and emotional symptoms persisted.

Conclusion

The majority of patients who present to the ED with minor head injuries suffer from concussive symptoms that do not resolve quickly. This information should be incorporated into discharge planning for these patients.

### The rapid resolution of depression and anxiety symptoms after lower limb amputation [^e3551e10]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

To ascertain the course of depressive and anxiety symptoms shortly after amputation and again after a period of inpatient rehabilitation.

Design and Settings

A cohort study in inpatients admitted to a rehabilitation ward after lower limb amputation.

Subjects

One hundred and five successive admissions over a one-year period.

Interventions

Nil.

Main Measures

Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) on admission and discharge with correlation to demographic and patient features.

Results

At admission, 28 (26.7%) and 26 (24.8%) patients had symptoms of depression and anxiety respectively. This dropped to 4 (3.8%) and 5 (4.8%) by time of discharge, a mean of 54.3 days later. These reductions were statistically significant, as was the association between patients having symptoms of both depression and anxiety (P < 0.001). Patient stay was longer in those with symptoms (depression, P < 0.03; anxiety P < 0.001). There was no association with level of amputation, success of limb-fitting, age or gender. Depressive symptoms were associated with presence of other medical conditions (P < 0.01) and anxiety scores with living in isolation (P < 0.05).

Conclusion

Depression and anxiety are commonly reported after lower limb amputation and previously thought to remain high for up to 10 years. We have found that levels of both depression and anxiety resolve rapidly. It is possible that a period of rehabilitation teaching new skills and improving patient independence and mobility may modify the previous bleak outlook of amputees. This positive finding may be useful in the rehabilitation of even the most distressed of amputees.

### Can selected patients with newly diagnosed pulmonary embolism be safely treated without hospitalization? A systematic review [^3208d03f]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Study Objective

Omitting inpatient therapy for emergency department patients with newly diagnosed pulmonary embolism occurs infrequently in the United States. We seek to describe the safety of initial outpatient management of these patients and their demographics, comorbidities, risk stratification, treatment, and outcomes.

Methods

We identified studies from searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE, and other databases from inception through March 22, 2012. We supplemented this with a search of conference proceedings and consultation with experts. We selected prospective studies of adults with acute, symptomatic, objectively confirmed pulmonary embolism who were discharged home without hospitalization. All contributing studies explicitly defined inclusion and exclusion criteria plus objectively confirmed outcome measures: recurrent thromboembolism, major hemorrhage, and mortality. Two investigators independently identified eligible studies and extracted data. We used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) criteria to assess study quality.

Results

From 2,286 screened titles/abstracts, we selected 8 studies with a total of 777 patients. Seven observational studies were rated low in quality. The one randomized controlled trial was higher in quality, used stricter inclusion criteria, and found that 90-day outcomes for outpatient management were not inferior to inpatient care. Among the 7 studies that reported 90-day outcome measures, the overall incidence of venous thromboembolic-related and hemorrhage-related mortality was very low: 0 of 741 (upper 95% confidence limit 0.62%).

Conclusion

The data on exclusive outpatient management of acute symptomatic pulmonary embolism are limited, but the existing evidence supports the feasibility and safety of this approach in carefully selected low-risk patients.

### Discharge clinical characteristics and post-discharge events in patients with severe COVID-19: a descriptive case series [^aaac2dcb]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

As the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic continues, little guidance is available on clinical indicators for safely discharging patients with severe COVID-19.

Objective

To describe the clinical courses of adult patients admitted for COVID-19 and identify associations between inpatient clinical features and post-discharge need for acute care.

Design

Retrospective chart reviews were performed to record laboratory values, temperature, and oxygen requirements of 99 adult inpatients with COVID-19. Those variables were used to predict emergency department (ED) visit or readmission within 30 days post-discharge.

Patients (or Participants)

Age ≥ 18 years, first hospitalization for COVID-19, admitted between March 1 and May 2, 2020, at University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) Medical Center, managed by an inpatient medicine service.

Main Measures

Ferritin, C-reactive protein, lactate dehydrogenase, D-dimer, procalcitonin, white blood cell count, absolute lymphocyte count, temperature, and oxygen requirement were noted.

Key Results

Of 99 patients, five required ED admission within 30 days, and another five required readmission. Fever within 24 h of discharge, oxygen requirement, and laboratory abnormalities were not associated with need for ED visit or readmission within 30 days of discharge after admission for COVID-19.

Conclusion

Our data suggest that neither persistent fever, oxygen requirement, nor laboratory marker derangement was associated with need for acute care in the 30-day period after discharge for severe COVID-19. These findings suggest that physicians need not await the normalization of laboratory markers, resolution of fever, or discontinuation of oxygen prior to discharging a stable or improving patient with COVID-19.

### Discharge clinical characteristics and post-discharge events in patients with severe COVID-19: a descriptive case series [^df1d8ab7]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

This report describes our experience with 99 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 at UCLA Medical Center. These patients were treated by hospitalist and critical care physicians, early on in the pandemic, at a time when concern for an inpatient census surge was high. Although our capacity for treating patients was never stressed, this concern spearheaded discussion of how to continually maximize inpatient capacity while prioritizing safe discharges. Little guidance was available to inform discharge criteria, so providers used their clinical judgment and shared decision-making with the patient to agree on a way forward. This created areas of clinical uncertainty, such as the proposition to discharge a patient who had a virus that was incompletely understood, on oxygen therapy. As such, close follow-up, either in-person or via telehealth, was arranged for these patients to ensure their continued clinical stability post-discharge. This allowed us to learn about any clinical deterioration after hospitalization and understand if peri-discharge clinical characteristics seemed to be associated with such cases.

In analyzing these patients' peri- and post-discharge courses, we found that persistent fever, oxygen requirement, and laboratory abnormalities in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 were not associated with emergency room visits or readmissions within 30 days of discharge. To our knowledge, this is the first case series examining the relationship between inpatient clinical data and post-discharge courses of hospitalized adults with COVID-19. Our results shed light on multiple clinical questions and may assist with challenging clinical decision-making in the inpatient setting.

Some patients, despite being weaned off supplemental oxygen therapy, may still have markedly elevated and persistently uptrending inflammatory markers. An elevated D-dimer may persuade a clinician to postpone the discharge for fear of an undiagnosed thrombus. There is little data to guide providers about the appropriate course of action in this context. Our experience indicates that the trajectories of ferritin, D-dimer, LDH, CRP, and procalcitonin do not identify patients at risk of ED visits or readmissions within 30 days of discharge. This may suggest that, in the absence of other clinical findings that would caution against discharge, extending observation for patients with alarmingly abnormal laboratory markers is likely unnecessary in the setting of clinical improvement.

### One-year trajectory of psychological symptoms in families of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients [^23aa181a]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Fig. 1
One-year trajectory of psychological symptoms in families of OHCA patients, and their associations with patient neurological outcomes and family resilience

Our findings have two important implications. First, most changes in symptoms occurred within the first three months, which suggest that some families of OHCA patients followed a natural trajectory of recovery within three months after hospital discharge. Similar trajectories have been reported in families of patients with other critical illnesses, which showed that most individuals recovered spontaneously within the first few months after a traumatic event, with only a minority developing long-term psychological disorders. Previous studies of psychological symptoms of OHCA patients' families have emphasized the high prevalence of such symptoms and the need for post-discharge follow-up systems. In contrast, our findings suggest that post-discharge support focused on families unlikely to recover spontaneously would be more effective. Therefore, future studies should explore whether families who exceed screening cutoffs three months after hospital discharge actually require mental health interventions, since whether all families with psychological symptoms at this time point should receive interventions remains unclear based on the present data. Clarifying these aspects will be essential for establishing recommendations on the optimal timing of psychological screening and appropriate intervention for families of OHCA patients.

Second, our findings suggest a novel hypothesis that patients' neurological outcomes and family resilience may influence whether early psychological symptoms of families following ICU discharge resolve or persist over time. A previous study showed that caregivers of OHCA survivors with cognitive or functional impairments frequently experience sustained emotional burden, often due to the need to decrease employment or personal activities to accommodate caregiving responsibilities. Furthermore, a previous qualitative study showed that family caregivers of OHCA survivors frequently experienced emotional conflicts, ongoing fear, and social isolation, while also feeling that their efforts were inadequately recognized by healthcare providers. These emotional needs may contribute to the chronicity of psychological distress. In addition, the present finding that all families with high resilience at one month after discharge recovered within one year suggested that implementing resilience-enhancing interventions in the early post-discharge period may help support psychological recovery for families of OHCA patients. To confirm these hypotheses, further large-scale observational studies using appropriate statistical methods are needed.

In conclusion, approximately 30% of families of OHCA patients continued to experience psychological symptoms one year after hospital discharge. The psychological symptoms were mostly observed to resolve in families with high resilience and in those of survivors with favorable neurological outcomes.

### Advanced life support. drowning process resuscitation [^5414f72f]. REDCROSS (2025). High credibility.

Advanced life support — drowning discharge after submersion evidence summary reports that a 2021 International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation (ILCOR) scoping review included five retrospective observational studies with a total of 834 patients, all under the age of 18. The studies evaluated clinical findings such as lung examination, room air oxygen saturation, vital signs, mental status, dyspnea, need for airway support, chest radiography, and arterial blood gas results to identify safe early discharge factors. For drowning patients under 18 years of age presenting to an emergency department with normal mentation, an observation period of at least 6 hours appears to be sufficient to allow for any clinical deterioration to be observed, and patients who maintain normal mentation without the need for supplemental oxygen and with normal age-adjusted vital signs can be considered for discharge following an observation period of at least 6 hours. A future systematic review will be required for any recommendations by ILCOR.

### American Society of Hematology, ABHH, ACHO, grupo CAHT, grupo CLAHT, SAH, SBHH, SHU, SOCHIHEM, SOMETH, sociedad panameña de hematología, sociedad peruana de hematología, and SVH 2022 guidelines for prevention of venous thromboembolism in surgical and medical patients and long-distance travelers in Latin America [^56182ad6]. Blood Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion.

For the majority of patients, the risk of VTE during the hospitalization is small and decreases sharply after discharge. In those circumstances, maintaining extended pharmacological prophylaxis likely will result in more harms (ie, bleeding) than benefits. However, there are some critically ill patients that are discharged after a prolonged hospitalization and need a longer period of rehabilitation in order to ambulate and perform basic daily life activities (such being able to eat or dress by themselves). Those patients are at higher risk of VTE and may benefit from an extended pharmacological prophylaxis. It is important, however, to discontinue it once immobility resolves (see recommendation 16).

In chronically ill patients, should we use thromboprophylaxis?

Recommendation 17

In chronically ill patients, the ASH Latin American Guideline Panel suggests against using thromboprophylaxis (conditional recommendation based on very low certainty in the evidence about effects ⨁◯◯◯).

Summary of the evidence.

No additional evidence on the efficacy or safety of the intervention was identified. The EtD framework is shown online at.

Justification.

This recommendation did not change its direction or its strength.

Conclusion.

In chronically ill medical patients, including nursing home patients, the harms of thromboprophylaxis (ie, bleeding) likely outweighs its benefits. Also, it adds cost and inconvenience for patients and caregivers. In chronically ill patients, early mobilization, rehabilitation, and physical therapy may be used along other nonpharmacological strategies to decrease VTE risk.

In acutely ill patients who require pharmacological thromboprophylaxis, should we use LMWH or direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs)?

Recommendations 18 and 19

In acutely ill patients who require pharmacological thromboprophylaxis, the ASH Latin American Guideline Panel suggests using LMWH over DOACs (conditional recommendation based on moderate certainty in the evidence about effects ⨁⨁⨁◯).

Summary of the evidence.

No additional evidence on the efficacy or safety of the intervention was identified. The EtD framework is shown online atand.

### Case report: antibiotic irrigation and drainage tube for managing chronic suppurative otitis media after cochlear implantation [^5cb4d0ca]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Cochlear implantation (CI) is the most effective solution for patients with severe-to-profound sensorineural hearing loss, especially in children. However, a major postoperative complication, known as chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM), poses challenges for both doctors and families of the patients, which can affect post-CI hearing outcomes. We present the case of post-CI CSOM in a 15-year-old girl. She had been utilizing a unilateral cochlear implant for 7years and had been experiencing intermittent earache and discharge in her only audible ear for the past 15months. After antibiotic treatment failed to resolve her symptoms, we opted for a tympanomastoidectomy, and removed the receiver-stimulator package while keeping the electrode inside her cochlea. Simultaneously, we inserted an irrigation and drainage tube into the mastoid and middle ear space to discharge the exudate and control infection by applying topical antibiotics. The patient's ear discharge had resolved within 1month, and her tympanic membrane healed naturally. Our successful experience shows that antibiotic irrigation and draining have effectively controlled infection and accelerated wound healing in this patient with post-CI CSOM, and it further prompted the patient to undergo bilateral CI 9months later.

Transcatheter aortic valve replacement — In patients who have new atrioventricular block after transcatheter aortic valve replacement associated with symptoms or hemodynamic instability that does not resolve, permanent pacing is recommended before discharge. In patients with new persistent bundle branch block after transcatheter aortic valve replacement, careful surveillance for bradycardia is reasonable. In patients with new persistent left bundle branch block (LBBB) after transcatheter aortic valve replacement, implantation of a permanent pacemaker may be considered.

### Treatment guidelines for hyponatremia: stay the course [^5f4beb21]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

For patients presenting with severe symptoms, the European Clinical Practice Guidelines and US/Irish expert panel both advocate bolus infusions of hypertonic saline in an effort to raise the serum sodium by 5 mmol/L (European) or by 4–6 mmol/L (US/Irish) within a few hours. An increase of this magnitude is sufficient to markedly reduce intracranial pressure and can reverse impending brain herniation. Bolus infusion of hypertonic saline has been reported to achieve the desired increment in serum sodium more rapidly than a continuous infusion of 3% saline, and it is associated with better clinical outcomes.

After treatment with either isotonic saline or hypertonic saline given by bolus or continuous infusion, the serum sodium often increases by more than intended. Indeed, the risk of "overshooting the mark" is one of the stated reasons for setting conservative correction goals when treating patients for severe hyponatremia. However, the main reason for an excessive rise in serum sodium is not an excessive dose of saline; rather, it is the sudden elimination of a large volume of dilute urine. If the cause of water retention and hyponatremia resolves, a water diuresis (often called an aquaresis) will emerge during treatment and can increase serum sodium by more than 2 mmol/L per hour. For this reason, in patients with a sodium ≤ 120 mmol/L, it is important to measure the serum sodium frequently and to monitor urine output carefully during treatment.

### Exercise-associated hyponatremia: updated guidelines… [^5aeb0ecf]. AAFP (2021). Medium credibility.

Key Points for Practice
- EAH risk can be reduced by limiting drinking only to respond to thirst with prolonged exertion.
- Because EAH and heat illness symptoms overlap, rectal temperature measurement is critical when assessing altered mental status associated with prolonged exertion.
- Severe EAH is best treated with hypertonic saline boluses. Aggressive cooling can be added if heat illness is also suspected.
- Mild EAH is treated with fluid restriction and oral hypertonic solutions, or salty foods can be added. From the AFP Editors Exercise-associated hyponatremia occurs when exertion results in sodium concentration less than 135 mEq per L, and symptoms can present up to 24 hours after physical activity. When asymptomatic ultramarathon participants are screened, up to one-half demonstrate hyponatremia. The usual cause of EAH is overhydration with hypotonic fluids such as water or sports drinks.

EAH must be differentiated from heat illness to avoid inappropriate treatment and adverse outcomes. Mild EAH symptoms of weakness, malaise, fatigue, irritability, headache, bloating, dizziness, and nausea and vomiting can also occur with heat exhaustion. Severe EAH presents with mental status changes similar to exertional heat stroke. High ambient temperatures increase the risk of EAH as well as heat illness. Injury logs from a national park showed that one in five nonfatal incidents initially characterized as heat-related were due to EAH. The Wilderness Medical Society has published updated guidelines for prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of EAH. Prevention EAH prevention centers on avoiding overhydration. No specific fluid volume intake recommendations have been shown to prevent hyponatremia, so the best recommendation is to limit drinking to respond to thirst. Limiting fluid availability during distance events reduces EAH rates.

Although fluids are lost through sweat during exercise, determining fluid replacement based on weight loss during prolonged exercise does not prevent EAH. Changes in antidiuretic hormone levels can predispose to EAH, and ADH levels increase with pain, stress, exercise, nausea, and hypoglycemia. Common medications such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors can also increase ADH. Because EAH is caused by overconsumption of hypotonic oral fluids and inappropriately elevated ADH levels, affected people most often have elevated or normal total body water. Hypovolemic EAH is uncommon and associated with chronic diuretic use and older age. The increased desire for high-sodium foods after prolonged sweating suggests that salt can be replaced orally. Sodium-rich foods and fluids should be available during lengthy exertion in high temperatures, although they will not prevent EAH when overdrinking occurs.

Assessment Because EAH symptoms overlap those of heat illness, rapid assessment of rectal temperature is essential when altered mental status is associated with prolonged exertion. Sodium point-of-care testing can be helpful if concomitant EAH is suspected, but availability is limited by high cost and requirement to keep testing kits within specified temperature ranges. If available, point-of-care testing for sodium and glucose is recommended for symptomatic athletes. Diagnosis of EAH will most often depend on a history of aggressive hydration and temperatures that are normal or minimally elevated. Overlapping symptoms make clinical assessment challenging. Without mental status changes, orthostatic symptoms and thirst can suggest heat illness, whereas bloating and lack of thirst can suggest EAH.

Drowning — emergency department observation and discharge: One study derived and validated a clinical score to assist in determining which patients may be safely discharged after 8 h of ED (emergency department) observation and found that the presence of 4 or more of normal mentation, normal respiratory rate, absence of dyspnea, absence of need for airway support, and absence of hypoxemia predicted safe discharge. Recommendation: After an ED observation period of 4 to 6 h, we suggest it is reasonable to discharge a drowning patient with normal mental status in whom respiratory function is normalized and no further deterioration in respiratory function has been observed. Weak recommendation, low-quality evidence.

### Two-year health outcomes in hospitalized COVID-19 survivors in China [^5b8c993a]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Importance

Relatively little is known about the persistence of symptoms in patients with COVID-19 for more than 1 year after their acute illness.

Objective

To assess the health outcomes among hospitalized COVID-19 survivors over 2 years and to identify factors associated with increased risk of persistent symptoms.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This was a longitudinal cohort study of patients who survived COVID-19 at 2 COVID-19-designated hospitals in Wuhan, China, from February 12 to April 10, 2020. All patients were interviewed via telephone at 1 year and 2 years after discharge. The 2-year follow-up study was conducted from March 1 to April 6, 2022. Statistical analysis was conducted from April 20 to May 5, 2022. The severity of disease was defined by World Health Organization guideline for COVID-19.

Exposures

COVID-19.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The main outcome was symptom changes over 2 years after hospital discharge. All patients completed a symptom questionnaire for evaluation of symptoms, along with a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease assessment test (CAT) at 1-year and 2-year follow-up visits.

Results

Of 3988 COVID-19 survivors, a total of 1864 patients (median [IQR] age, 58.5 [49.0–68.0] years; 926 male patients [49.7%]) were available for both 1-year and 2-year follow-up visits. The median (IQR) time from discharge to follow-up at 2 years was 730 (719–743) days. At 2 years after hospital discharge, 370 patients (19.8%) still had symptoms, including 224 (12.0%) with persisting symptoms and 146 (7.8%) with new-onset or worsening of symptoms. The most common symptoms were fatigue, chest tightness, anxiety, dyspnea, and myalgia. Most symptoms resolved over time, but the incidence of dyspnea showed no significant change (1-year vs 2-year, 2.6% [49 patients] vs 2.0% [37 patients]). A total of 116 patients (6.2%) had CAT total scores of at least 10 at 2 years after discharge. Patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit had higher risks of persistent symptoms (odds ratio, 2.69; 95% CI, 1.02–7.06; P = 0.04) and CAT scores of 10 or higher (odds ratio, 2.83; 95% CI, 1.21–6.66; P = 0.02).

Conclusions and Relevance

In this cohort study, 2 years after hospital discharge, COVID-19 survivors had a progressive decrease in their symptom burden, but those with severe disease during hospitalization, especially those who required intensive care unit admission, had higher risks of persistent symptoms. These results are related to the original strain of the virus, and their relevance to infections with the Omicron variant is not known.

### Post-discharge symptoms among hospitalized COVID-19 patients in Nigeria: a single-center study [^6c116b8d]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2021). Medium credibility.

Two asymptomatic patients on day 7 of follow-up later developed symptoms on days 14 and 30. One of these previously asymptomatic patients is a 28-year-old health-care worker who developed fever and dry cough 30 days after a previously negative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test for COVID-19 and 6 weeks after the first diagnosis of COVID-19. A repeat PCR test confirmed COVID-19, but viral culture could not be done, and genomic sequencing of patient samples was not available at the time of this report. The second patient was a 46-year-old housewife who developed chest pain and throat discomfort on day 14 of follow-up.

Lower limb numbness and leg pain were reported by four patients on days 7, 21, and 58 of follow-up. Two of these patients reported associated painful leg swelling and were confirmed to have deep vein thrombosis (DVT), which was corroborated by lower limb Doppler ultrasound (Figure 3). These cases of DVT resolved on days 14 and 238 of follow-up after use of compression stockings and oral anticoagulant therapy (20 mg rivaroxaban twice daily). A 71-year-old who was diagnosed as hypertensive for the first time during hospitalization for COVID-19 complained of fatigue and excessive expectoration of mucus on day 7 of follow-up. On day 37 post-discharge, he developed progressive right-side limb weakness associated with slurring of speech and worsening fatigue. A brain computed tomographic scan was normal. A diagnosis of ischemic stroke was made. After physiotherapy, anti-platelet therapy, and blood pressure control, limb weakness and slurred speech resolved completely within 2 weeks. At day 154 post-discharge, this patient complained of persistent fatigue but was otherwise clinically stable. A 45-year-old health-care worker complained of nighttime shortness of breath and nightmares on day 7 of follow-up. Nighttime shortness of breath persisted on day 21 of follow-up and was associated with dry cough. On clinical evaluation, vital signs and chest examination were essentially normal. Oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry remained > 98% at every follow-up visit. All symptoms resolved on day 31 of follow-up and the patient has remained asymptomatic at day 211 of follow-up.

American Thoracic Society dyspnea — executive summary epidemiology and prognosis reports that dyspnea is common in both inpatient and ambulatory settings, is strongly prognostic, and that addressing the underlying cause is the preferred management approach. Dyspnea "affects up to 50% of patients admitted to acute, tertiary care hospitals and a quarter of patients seeking care in ambulatory settings", and "The presence of dyspnea is a potent predictor of mortality, often surpassing common physiological measurements in predicting the clinical course of a patient". The statement adds, "Diagnosis and treatment of the underlying cause of dyspnea is the preferred and most direct approach to ameliorating this symptom, but there are many patients for whom the cause is unclear or for whom dyspnea persists despite optimal treatment".

### Clinical policy: critical issues in the evaluation and management of adult patients in the emergency department with asymptomatic elevated blood pressure [^a5776ba3]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2013). Medium credibility.

Emergency department asymptomatic markedly elevated blood pressure — evidence and management considerations include limited trial support, short-rest effects, and cautions around rapid lowering. A 2008 Cochrane review of 15 randomized controlled trials between 1983 and 2004 found insufficient evidence to support or refute this practice, and two studies suggest that observation with ED medical intervention is reasonable. In a study of 549 asymptomatic emergency department (ED) patients with markedly elevated blood pressure (≥ 180 mm Hg systolic and/or ≥ 110 mm Hg diastolic), 175 of 549 patients (32%; 95% CI 28% to 36%) had a spontaneous decrease within 30 minutes of quiet rest, defined as less than 180/110 mm Hg with at least a 20 mm Hg systolic or 10 mm Hg diastolic decrease; nonresponders treated with immediate-acting agents improved in all but 78 of 549 patients (14%; 95% CI 11% to 17%), and no serious hypertension-related or postintervention adverse events occurred on telephone follow-up 48 to 72 hours after discharge. A VA Cooperative Trial (1967) randomized 143 male patients with diastolic blood pressure of 115 mm Hg to 130 mm Hg, showing no adverse outcomes during the initial 3 months; within 4 months, 4 of 70 placebo patients (6%; 95% CI 2% to 14%) versus 0 of 73 treated patients (0%; 95% CI 0% to 5%) developed significant complications, and within 20 months adverse events occurred in 27 of 70 placebo patients (39%; 95% CI 27% to 51%) versus 2 of 73 treated patients (3%; 95% CI 0.3% to 9.5%), representing absolute risk reduction 36% and number needed to treat = 3. It is generally accepted that rapid lowering in asymptomatic patients has the potential to do harm; however, in selected social or clinical situations emergency physicians may choose to initiate treatment before discharge to gradually lower blood pressure and/or initiate long-term control, noting that a significant portion of patients' blood pressures spontaneously decrease without intervention during the 60 and 90 minutes after the initial ED measurement.

(B) The postgadolinium sagittal T1-weighted image of patient 3 demonstrates thickening and enhancement of the cauda equina (asterisk). Fourteen days later, enhancement of most cranial nerves was found, exemplified by the trigeminal (B′, arrowheads) and facial nerves (B′′). (C) Axial T2-weighted image of patient 4 at admission with large confluent hyperintensities (arrowheads) that show inhomogeneous and incomplete enhancement (sagittal T1-weighted image postgadolinium, C′).

Duration of the modified zipper method is marked by horizontal bars matching the dotted lines in grayscale that indicate the course of each patient. GBS, Guillain-Barré syndrome.

One week after symptom onset, we initiated 7 cycles of the modified zipper method. Symptoms resolved rapidly and the patient was extubated after the fourth cycle. In a follow-up MRI 14 days after initiation of the zipper method, edema and signal alterations had resolved, and the patient was transferred to a regular ward. While muscle reflexes remained slightly reduced, no residual paralysis was observed. Twenty days after the first cycle of modified zipper method the patient regained full motor function. She was discharged home after 25 days of hospital treatment.

Altogether, the long-term outcome was very favorable. While the patient still noticed a minimal reduced ability to concentrate on the day of discharge, a neurocognitive evaluation 3 months post symptom onset was unremarkable. She was still symptom-free at a follow-up evaluation 9 months post symptom onset (Table 2).

Tricuspid valve surgery — Pacing indications: In patients undergoing tricuspid valve surgery, routine placement of temporary epicardial pacing wires is recommended. In patients who have new postoperative SND or atrioventricular block associated with symptoms or hemodynamic instability that does not resolve after tricuspid valve surgery, permanent pacing is recommended before discharge. In patients who are undergoing tricuspid valve replacement or tricuspid repair with high risk for postoperative atrioventricular block, intraoperative placement of permanent epicardial leads at the time of cardiac surgery is reasonable.

### Patients leaving against medical advice (AMA) from the emergency department – disease prevalence and willingness to return [^c0810b6a]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Background

How patients fare once they leave the emergency department (ED) against medical advice (AMA), and the extent of illness burden that accompanies them, remains unstudied.

Objective

To determine the fate of patients leaving the ED AMA for a defined period of time post-discharge.

Methods

This was a prospective follow-up study of a convenience sample of patients leaving the ED AMA during two 6-month periods in consecutive calendar years at an urban academic ED with 32,000 annual patient visits.

Results

A total of 199 patients were identified, with 194 enrolled. Categories of discharge diagnoses included cardiovascular, undifferentiated abdominal pain, respiratory, and cellulitis. Of the 194 patients studied, 126 patients (64.9%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 57.6–71.5%) stated that their symptoms had improved or resolved. Of these 126 patients, 109 (86.5%, 95% CI 78.9–91.7%) had their original AMA discharge diagnoses referable to cardiovascular pathology. Ninety-five patients (75.4%, 95% CI 66.7–82.4%) with improved or abated symptoms did not plan to return. Of those with improved or abated symptoms, 31 patients (24.6%, 95% CI 17.6–33.2%) did return, and with further evaluation, 15 of them were found to have significant clinical findings. Of the 68 patients with continuing symptoms, 36 (52.9%, 95% CI 40.5–64.9%) returned for further evaluation. A total of 127 patients did not return. Twenty-five patients (19.7%, 95% CI 15.9–25.4%) expressed a reluctance to return to the same ED for fear of embarrassment. Seven patients (5.5%, 95% CI 4.8–8.7%) who did not seek alternative care but were still having symptoms did not return due to job or family commitments or because they would follow-up with a personal physician.

Conclusion

Patients who leave the ED AMA have significant pathology.

### Early discharge hospital at home [^ff794d3e]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Early discharge hospital at home is a service that provides active treatment by healthcare professionals in the patient's home for a condition that otherwise would require acute hospital inpatient care. This is an update of a Cochrane review.

Objectives

To determine the effectiveness and cost of managing patients with early discharge hospital at home compared with inpatient hospital care.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases to 9 January 2017: the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care Group (EPOC) register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and EconLit. We searched clinical trials registries.

Selection Criteria

Randomised trials comparing early discharge hospital at home with acute hospital inpatient care for adults. We excluded obstetric, paediatric and mental health hospital at home schemes. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We followed the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane and EPOC. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of the body of evidence for the most important outcomes.

Main Results

We included 32 trials (N = 4746), six of them new for this update, mainly conducted in high-income countries. We judged most of the studies to have a low or unclear risk of bias. The intervention was delivered by hospital outreach services (17 trials), community-based services (11 trials), and was co-ordinated by a hospital-based stroke team or physician in conjunction with community-based services in four trials. Studies recruiting people recovering from strokeEarly discharge hospital at home probably makes little or no difference to mortality at three to six months (risk ratio (RR) 0.92, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.57 to 1.48, N = 1114, 11 trials, moderate-certainty evidence) and may make little or no difference to the risk of hospital readmission (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.66, N = 345, 5 trials, low-certainty evidence). Hospital at home may lower the risk of living in institutional setting at six months (RR 0.63, 96% CI 0.40 to 0.98; N = 574, 4 trials, low-certainty evidence) and might slightly improve patient satisfaction (N = 795, low-certainty evidence). Hospital at home probably reduces hospital length of stay, as moderate-certainty evidence found that people assigned to hospital at home are discharged from the intervention about seven days earlier than people receiving inpatient care (95% CI 10.19 to 3.17 days earlier, N = 528, 4 trials). It is uncertain whether hospital at home has an effect on cost (very low-certainty evidence). Studies recruiting people with a mix of medical conditionsEarly discharge hospital at home probably makes little or no difference to mortality (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.49; N = 1247, 8 trials, moderate-certainty evidence). In people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) there was insufficient information to determine the effect of these two approaches on mortality (RR 0.53, 95% CI 0.25 to 1.12, N = 496, 5 trials, low-certainty evidence). The intervention probably increases the risk of hospital readmission in a mix of medical conditions, although the results are also compatible with no difference and a relatively large increase in the risk of readmission (RR 1.25, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.58, N = 1276, 9 trials, moderate-certainty evidence). Early discharge hospital at home may decrease the risk of readmission for people with COPD (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.13, N = 496, 5 trials low-certainty evidence). Hospital at home may lower the risk of living in an institutional setting (RR 0.69, 0.48 to 0.99; N = 484, 3 trials, low-certainty evidence). The intervention might slightly improve patient satisfaction (N = 900, low-certainty evidence). The effect of early discharge hospital at home on hospital length of stay for older patients with a mix of conditions ranged from a reduction of 20 days to a reduction of less than half a day (moderate-certainty evidence, N = 767). It is uncertain whether hospital at home has an effect on cost (very low-certainty evidence). Studies recruiting people undergoing elective surgeryThree studies did not report higher rates of mortality with hospital at home compared with inpatient care (data not pooled, N = 856, low-certainty evidence; mainly orthopaedic surgery). Hospital at home may lead to little or no difference in readmission to hospital for people who were mainly recovering from orthopaedic surgery (N = 1229, low-certainty evidence). We could not establish the effects of hospital at home on the risk of living in institutional care, due to a lack of data. The intervention might slightly improve patient satisfaction (N = 1229, low-certainty evidence). People recovering from orthopaedic surgery allocated to early discharge hospital at home were discharged from the intervention on average four days earlier than people allocated to usual inpatient care (4.44 days earlier, 95% CI 6.37 to 2.51 days earlier, N = 411, 4 trials, moderate-certainty evidence). It is uncertain whether hospital at home has an effect on cost (very low-certainty evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

Despite increasing interest in the potential of early discharge hospital at home services as a less expensive alternative to inpatient care, this review provides insufficient evidence of economic benefit (through a reduction in hospital length of stay) or improved health outcomes.

Abstract

An 18-year-old woman with a history of focal epilepsy presents with increasingly frequent seizures, encephalopathy, multiple laboratory abnormalities, and hypothermia. During her hospital course, her symptoms waxed and waned. Multiple etiologies of her symptoms were considered, but the spontaneous resolution of her symptoms and an abnormal MRI of the brain revealed the final diagnosis.

### Rivaroxaban versus no anticoagulation for post-discharge thromboprophylaxis after hospitalisation for COVID-19 (MICHELLE): an open-label, multicentre, randomised, controlled trial [^cffbb2b3]. Lancet (2022). Excellent credibility.

The study MICHELLE was published by Eduardo Ramacciotti and colleagues in 2022 in the journal Lancet. This study is related to the following diseases: COVID-19 infection. In the MICHELLE study, the trial question was: what is the role of rivaroxaban in patients at high risk for VTE discharged after hospitalization due to COVID-19? In the MICHELLE study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the MICHELLE study, the population was: 318 patients (127 female, 191 male). The inclusion criteria were patients hospitalized with COVID-19 at increased risk for VTE. The key exclusion criteria were IMPROVE-VTE score < 4 and D-dimer within normal range, severe renal failure, indication for anticoagulation therapy, contraindications to anticoagulation. In the MICHELLE study, the interventions were: n = 159 rivaroxaban (10 mg/day for 35 days) n = 159 no anticoagulation (regular follow-up for 35 days). In the MICHELLE study, the primary outcome was: significant decrease in symptomatic or fatal VTE, asymptomatic VTE on bilateral lower-limb venous ultrasound and CT pulmonary angiogram, symptomatic arterial thromboembolism, and cardiovascular death at day 35 (3.14% vs. 9.43%; RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.9). In the MICHELLE study, the secondary outcomes were: significant decrease in symptomatic and fatal VTE (0.63% vs. 5.03%; RR 0.13, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.99) No significant difference in symptomatic VTE and all-cause mortality (2.52% vs. 5.66%; RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.14 to 1.41) Significant decrease in symptomatic VTE, myocardial infarction stroke, cardiovascular death (0.63% vs. 5.66%; RR 0.11, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.87). In the MICHELLE study, the safety outcomes were: no significant differences in clinically relevant non-major bleeding, other bleeding. In the MICHELLE study, the conclusion was: in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 at increased risk for VTE, rivaroxaban was superior to no anticoagulation with respect to symptomatic or fatal VTE, asymptomatic VTE on bilateral lower-limb venous ultrasound and CT pulmonary angiogram, symptomatic arterial thromboembolism, and cardiovascular death at day 35.

### ICU admission, discharge, and triage guidelines: a framework to enhance clinical operations, development of institutional policies, and further research [^3ce05466]. Critical Care Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

Intensive care unit (ICU) discharge — recommendations: We suggest that every ICU stipulate specific discharge criteria in its ADT policy (ungraded). We suggest that it is appropriate to discharge a patient from the ICU to a lower acuity area when a patient's physiologic status has stabilized and there no longer is a need for ICU monitoring and treatment (ungraded). We suggest that the discharge parameters be based on ICU admission criteria, the admitting criteria for the next lower level of care, institutional availability of these resources, patient prognosis, physiologic stability, and ongoing active interventions (ungraded). We suggest that, to improve resource utilization, discharge from the ICU is appropriate despite a deteriorated patient's physiological status if active interventions are no longer planned (ungraded). We suggest refraining from transferring patients to lower acuity care areas based solely on severity-of-illness scores (ungraded). General and specific severity-of-illness scoring systems can identify patient populations at higher risk of clinical deterioration after ICU discharge, however, their value for assessing the readiness for transfer of individual patients to lower acuity care has not been evaluated. Patients admitted to the ICU must be reevaluated continuously to identify those who no longer require ICU level care.

The study MOVe-OUT (patient-reported symptom outcomes) was published by Yanfen Guan and colleagues in 2023 in the journal Clin Infect Dis. This study is related to the following diseases: COVID-19 infection. In the MOVe-OUT (patient-reported symptom outcomes) study, the trial question was: what is the role of molnupiravir in at-risk, unvaccinated patients with COVID-19? In the MOVe-OUT (patient-reported symptom outcomes) study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the MOVe-OUT (patient-reported symptom outcomes) study, the population was: 1408 patients (723 female, 685 male). The inclusion criteria were nonhospitalized, unvaccinated, at-risk adults with mild-to-moderate, laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and symptom onset within 5 days before randomization. The key exclusion criteria were current hospitalization or an expected need for hospitalization due to COVID-19 within 48 hours of randomization; receipt of certain therapies indicated specifically for the treatment of COVID-19 or SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. In the MOVe-OUT (patient-reported symptom outcomes) study, the interventions were: n = 709 molnupiravir (oral dose of 800 mg BID for 5 days) n = 699 placebo (matching placebo BID for 5 days). In the MOVe-OUT (patient-reported symptom outcomes) study, the primary outcome was: significant increase in median time to first resolution of symptoms (18 days vs. 20 days; HR 1.18, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.34). In the MOVe-OUT (patient-reported symptom outcomes) study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in median time to first alleviation of symptoms (13 days vs. 15 days; HR 1.16, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.32) Significant increase in median time to alleviation of all symptoms through day 29 (8 days vs. 10 days; HR 1.24, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.4) Borderline significant increase in median time to sustained alleviation of all symptoms through day 29 (15 days vs. 16 days; HR 1.17, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.33). In the MOVe-OUT (patient-reported symptom outcomes) study, the conclusion was: in nonhospitalized, unvaccinated, at-risk adults with mild-to-moderate, laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and symptom onset within 5 days before randomization, molnupiravir was superior to placebo with respect to median time to first resolution of symptoms.

### Post-discharge symptoms among hospitalized COVID-19 patients in Nigeria: a single-center study [^322c2eac]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2021). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

The COVID-19 pandemic continues to ravage health systems across the globe. The disease is typically characterized by acute symptoms of fever, cough, and shortness of breath, as well as other multisystemic signs and symptoms. Most patients recover completely within 2 weeks of first symptoms, but recovery may take 3 to 6 weeks in severe cases. However, there is now evidence that COVID-19 symptoms may persist or reoccur in some individuals even after the initial recovery period. These post-recovery symptoms have been called various names, such as post-acute COVID-19 syndrome (PCS), long COVID-19, and post-acute sequalae of severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. –

Amenta et al.have suggested three categories of PCS, including 1) residual symptoms that persist after recovery from acute infection, 2) organ dysfunction that persists after initial recovery, and 3) new symptoms or syndromes that develop after initial asymptomatic or mild infection. Fatigue, dyspnea, joint pain, and cough have been described as the most common manifestations among patients with PCS, but sequelae have been reported in diverse organ systems.

As April 29, 2021, Nigeria has reported 165,055 cases, 155,041 recoveries, and 2,063 deaths resulting from COVID-19. Although the spectrum of clinical presentations of acute COVID-19 have been described by various authors from Nigeria, – there is a paucity of studies on post-discharge symptoms among hospitalized COVID-19 patients from Nigeria. A study from an outpatient clinic in Lagos state, southwest Nigeria, revealed that 40.6% of patients had features of PCS after a median follow-up period of about 2 weeks after discharge. To extend the understanding of post-acute COVID-19 in Nigeria, we describe post-discharge symptoms among hospitalized COVID-19 patients on follow-up at a COVID-19 treatment center in Bayelsa State, south–south Nigeria.

### Identifying patients at risk of post-discharge complications related to COVID-19 infection [^12a7c2ec]. Thorax (2021). Medium credibility.

SARS-CoV-2 infection is a multisystem disease with post-discharge sequelae. We report early follow-up data from one UK hospital of the initial 200 hospital inpatients with slow recovery from the condition. At 4weeks post-discharge, 321/957 survivors (34%) had persistent symptoms. A structured outpatient clinical assessment protocol was designed, and outcomes from the first 200 patients seen 4–6 weeks post-discharge are presented here. In 80/200 (40%), we identified at follow-up a cardiorespiratory cause of breathlessness, including persistent parenchymal abnormality (64 patients), pulmonary embolism (four patients) and cardiac complications (eight patients). These findings occurred both in patients who had intensive care unit (ICU) admissions and those who had been managed on the ward, although patients requiring ICU admissions were more likely to have a significant cardiorespiratory cause found for their breathlessness, risk ratio 2.8 (95% CI 1.5 to 5.1).

Conclusion

Timely and appropriate patient follow-up is essential for the future care and safety of our patients following discharge. We have a duty, as doctors, to make sure that these arrangements are made and it is clear from this study that a change is needed in our current system. After discussions with colleagues, there was a consensus that an online system would be most appropriate and given the times at which patients are discharged and that doctors work, there is a need for access to appointments 24-hours a day.

### The timing of development and subsequent clinical course of heart failure after a myocardial infarction [^451b4a1f]. European Heart Journal (2008). Low credibility.

Aims

Myocardial infarction (MI) is a common cause of heart failure (HF), which may develop early and persist or resolve, or develop late. The cumulative incidence, persistence, and resolution of HF after MI are poorly described. The aim of this study is to describe the natural history and prognosis of HF after an MI.

Methods and Results

Patients with a death or discharge diagnosis of MI in 1998 were identified from records of hospitals providing services to a local community of 600 000 people. Records were scrutinized to identify the development of HF, defined as signs and symptoms consistent with that diagnosis and treated with loop diuretics. HF was considered to have resolved if diuretics could be stopped without recurrent symptoms. Totally, 896 patients were identified of whom 54% had died by December 2005. During the index admission, 199 (22.2%) patients died, many with HF, and a further 182 (20.3%) patients developed HF that persisted until discharge, of whom 121 died subsequent to discharge. Of 74 patients with transient HF that resolved before discharge, 41 had recurrent HF and 38 died during follow-up. After discharge, 145 (33%) patients developed HF for the first time, of whom 76 died during follow-up. Overall, of 281 deaths occurring after discharge, 235 (83.6%) were amongst inpatients who first developed HF.

Conclusion

The development of HF precedes death in most patients who die in the short- or long-term following an MI. Prevention of HF, predominantly by reducing the extent of myocardial damage and recurrent MI, and subsequent management could have a substantial impact on prognosis.

- Have inherited or acquired hypercoagulopathies
- Have uncontrolled hypertension
- Have diabetes mellitus with vascular disease
- Have headaches with focal neurological symptoms or have migraine headaches with or without aura if over age 35. Current diagnosis of, or history of, breast cancer, which may be hormone-sensitive Stop Drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol if an arterial or venous thrombotic event occurs. The risk of thromboembolic disease due to oral contraceptives gradually disappears after COC use is discontinued. Figure 2 shows the risk of developing a VTE for women who are not pregnant and do not use oral contraceptives, for women who use oral contraceptives, for pregnant women, and for women in the postpartum period.

To put the risk of developing a VTE into perspective: If 10, 000 women who are not pregnant and do not use oral contraceptives are followed for one year, between 1 and 5 of these women will develop a VTE. Figure 2. Likelihood of Developing a Serious Blood Clot * Pregnancy data based on actual duration of pregnancy in the reference studies. Based on a model assumption that pregnancy duration is nine months, the rate is 7 to 27 per 10, 000 WY. If feasible, stop drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol at least 4 weeks before and through 2 weeks after major surgery or other surgeries known to have an elevated risk of thromboembolism. Start drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol no earlier than 4 weeks after delivery, in women who are not breastfeeding. The risk of postpartum thromboembolism decreases after the third postpartum week, whereas the risk of ovulation increases after the third postpartum week.

Use of COCs also increases the risk of arterial thromboses such as strokes and myocardial infarctions, especially in women with other risk factors for these events. COCs have been shown to increase both the relative and attributable risks of cerebrovascular events, although, in general, the risk is greatest among older, hypertensive women who also smoke. COCs also increase the risk for stroke in women with other underlying risk factors. Oral contraceptives must be used with caution in women with cardiovascular disease risk factors. Stop drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol if there is unexplained loss of vision, proptosis, diplopia, papilledema, or retinal vascular lesions. Evaluate for retinal vein thrombosis immediately.

Drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets contain 3 mg of the progestin DRSP which has anti-mineralocorticoid activity, including the potential for hyperkalemia in high-risk patients, comparable to a 25 mg dose of spironolactone. Drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol is contraindicated in patients with conditions that predispose to hyperkalemia. Women receiving daily, long-term treatment for chronic conditions or diseases with medications that may increase serum potassium concentration should have their serum potassium concentration checked during the first treatment cycle. Medications that may increase serum potassium concentration include ACE inhibitors, angiotensin-II receptor antagonists, potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplementation, heparin, aldosterone antagonists, and NSAIDS.

Surviving Sepsis Campaign — discharge planning after intensive care unit (ICU) transfer: For adults with sepsis and septic shock and their families, we suggest using a critical care transition program, compared to usual care, upon transfer to the floor (weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence). For adults with sepsis and septic shock, we recommend reconciling medications at both ICU and hospital discharge (best practice statement). For adult survivors of sepsis and septic shock and their families, we recommend including information about the ICU stay, sepsis and related diagnoses, treatments, and common impairments after sepsis in the written and verbal hospital discharge summary (best practice statement). The rationale emphasizes that transfer from ICU to general floor and discharge from the hospital are both vulnerable periods for patients, with high frequency of medication errors and information loss.

### Clinical policy: critical issues in the evaluation and Management of adult patients presenting to the emergency department with suspected acute venous thromboembolic disease [^c9056d1e]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) early discharge — evidence and recommendation: A Class III prospective trial followed 275 low-risk patients by Hestia criteria; all received low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) followed by a vitamin K antagonist (VKA) and were discharged within 24 hours, and the 90-day incidence of recurrent venous thromboembolism (VTE), major bleeding, and mortality was determined to be similar to traditional inpatient care; 11 patients were excluded for a perceived "large clot burden". A meta-analysis including 8 retrospective studies reported rates of recurrent VTE, major hemorrhage, and mortality of 1.5%, 0.8%, and 1.6%, respectively. Given that nearly 50% of acute PE cases meet low-risk criteria, this implies approximately half of newly diagnosed PE patients may be eligible for discharge directly home from the emergency department (ED). Screening for right ventricular dysfunction did not significantly improve low-risk identification and, under the Hestia rule, would have led to one-third of truly low-risk patients being falsely classified as nonlow risk. Despite supportive literature, the current evidence supported only a Level C recommendation. The contributing studies only treated patients with a LMWH followed by a VKA; although NOACs are an approved therapy for VTE, there are limited data for early discharge of PE patients receiving a NOAC, and no current data suggests any reason why a NOAC would be inferior for this group.

Theme 2: Following CAR-T infusion, some patients experienced intense symptoms, others were confused and feared being asymptomatic as a sign that CAR-T did not work and others did not recall experiencing neurotoxicity

Following CAR-T infusion, a few participants noted that the patient experienced no symptoms or "minimal fatigue", which concerned some caregivers about CAR-T "not working". In contrast, most patients experienced fatigue and weakness, which was severe for some, delayed recovery and discharge, and were distressing for their caregivers ("She was very fatigued and not able to really care for herself without assistance"). For most patients, fatigue and weakness slowly improved during hospitalization.

A large proportion of patients experienced CRS, or a myriad of symptoms such as fever, chills, sweat, shivers, blood pressure fluctuations, hypoxia, feeling cold, "cognitive reactions", anorexia, and headache. These symptoms were severe and distressing for some participants ("I remember that I kept talking to this kid that I thought was in the room but he wasn′t.(.) My brain was the worst, thinking and doing things weird") but not for others ("I thought it [the CRS] was something benign"). Most participants reported that the fever, chills, and low blood pressure resolved during hospitalization.

Some patients experienced neurotoxicity or symptoms such as aphasia, confusion, dysgraphia, difficulties focusing, difficulties with coordination and memory, delirium, hallucinations, "cognitive changes", or "brain necrosis". One patient and several caregivers reported changes in the patient's usual behavior. Most patients did not recall neurological symptoms but were told by clinicians and their caregivers ("The worst part about the CAR-T in the hospital was knowing that something had happened and I didn′t recall it"). Other patients were aware of experiencing aphasia, confusion, dysgraphia, and difficulties with coordination, and memory gaps and described them as "the hardest", "the worst", "when (you are) the most discouraged". Caregivers reported feeling "disturbed" and "shocked" when patients did not recognize who, when, and where they were, nor were they able to write. Some participants reported that the neurological symptoms resolved within hours or days.

### Twelve-month systemic consequences of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in patients discharged from hospital: a prospective cohort study in wuhan, China [^e0a9a46b]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

Despite the rapid worldwide spread of SARS-CoV-2 and more comprehensive understanding of COVID-19, data on long-term prognosis and sequelae of COVID-19 remain scarce. Therefore, we conducted a prospective cohort study of 594 patients with confirmed COVID-19 who had clinically recovered and been discharged from Tongji hospital. As shown in Abstract Figure 3, at 3 months post-discharge, although most symptoms had improved or completely resolved, roughly half of the patients (51.2%) were still experiencing at least 1 symptom of the disease, and the prevalence of symptoms decreased to 28.4% at 12 months following discharge. Although frequency of laboratory abnormalities decreased and most laboratory tests returned to normal during the follow-up period, the frequencies of abnormal alkaline phosphatase, creatinine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, and myoglobin concentrations maintained at high level. The common abnormal chest CT findings included fibrous stripes, pleural thickening and adhesions, and enlarged lymph nodes signs. Abnormalities in pulmonary function including obstructive, restrictive, and mixed were observed in a small number of patients, whereas electrocardiogram abnormalities such as arrhythmia, ST-T change, and conduction block were present in 51.0% of the patients at 3 months, 61.1% at 6 months and 49.8% at 12 months post-discharge, respectively.

Conclusions

This cohort study suggests that treatment for aneurysmal SAH should ideally be provided within 12.5 hours after onset but not beyond 24 hours because this results in improved 12-month survival and a greater likelihood of discharge home, independent of severity of the aneurysmal SAH and other confounders. Too few people with aneurysmal SAH are treated within the 12.5- or 24-hour window associated with the best outcomes. Interventions to reduce time to treatment may be warranted if these findings are confirmed in other cohorts.

Short versus long ICU care — We suggest that patients receive ICU treatment if their prognosis for recovery and quality of life is acceptable regardless of their length of ICU stay; however, factors such as age, comorbidities, prognosis, underlying diagnosis, and treatment modalities that can influence survival should be taken into account (ungraded). Supporting context notes that older patients and those with prolonged requirement for life-supportive therapies, pre-existing comorbidities, and multisystem organ failure have higher mortality rates, and that the dominant reasons for prolonged ICU stays are multiple organ failure, ventilatory support, or single-organ failure in nonventilated patients.
