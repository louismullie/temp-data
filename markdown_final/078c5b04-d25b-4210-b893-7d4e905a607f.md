## Question

A 45-year-old male presents to his primary care doctor complaining of abdominal pain. He reports a three-month history of intermittent burning pain localized to the epigastrium that worsens 2–3 hours after a meal. He attributes this pain to increased stress at his job. He is otherwise healthy and takes no medications. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. His temperature is 98.8°F (37.1°C), blood pressure is 130/85 mmHg, pulse is 90/min, and respirations are 18/min. Physical examination reveals mild epigastric tenderness to palpation. A urease breath test is positive. Which of the following treatments is most appropriate first-line therapy for this patient?
A. Sulfasalazine
B. Pantoprazole
C. Amoxicillin, clarithromycin, and omeprazole
D. Tetracycline, omeprazole, bismuth, and metronidazole

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which first-line Helicobacter pylori eradication regimen is most appropriate for a 45-year-old man with epigastric burning pain and a positive urea breath test. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and the clinical syndrome. Then, I should verify the indications for eradication and the test-and-treat strategy. Next, I will review contemporary guideline-preferred first-line regimens and why legacy triple therapy is no longer appropriate. After that, I need to consider patient-specific factors such as penicillin allergy and prior antibiotic exposures. Finally, I will select the optimal regimen, specify the duration, and outline follow-up testing and contingency plans if eradication fails.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and syndrome. The patient has classic epigastric burning pain 2–3 hours postprandially, no alarm features, and a positive urea breath test, which establishes active H. pylori infection and supports a diagnosis of uninvestigated dyspepsia in a patient under 60 years old. This fits a test-and-treat approach rather than immediate endoscopy in the absence of red flags [^116v4nbG].

> Wait, let me verify the indication to treat. Guidelines recommend that all patients with an indication for testing should be offered effective eradication therapy if infection is confirmed, and a test-and-treat strategy is reasonable in adults under 60 without alarm features. Eradication can improve dyspeptic symptoms in a subset and addresses ulcer risk and potential cancer prevention downstream, so I should proceed with eradication rather than symptom-only therapy here [^116v4nbG] [^111HF4MX].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about regimen choice. I initially thought "standard triple therapy" might be fine because it's familiar, but I need to check current resistance patterns and guideline positions. In the United States, clarithromycin resistance is about 20–30% and levofloxacin resistance approaches 40%, making empiric clarithromycin triple therapy unreliable; ACG 2024 advises against empiric clarithromycin- or levofloxacin-containing regimens without proven susceptibility, so legacy PPI–clarithromycin–amoxicillin triple therapy is not appropriate first-line here [^112wUATa] [^112jtYX7].

> Let me consider the preferred empiric first-line options. ACG 2024 recommends optimized bismuth quadruple therapy for 14 days as the preferred empiric regimen when susceptibility is unknown, with rifabutin triple therapy or PCAB-based regimens as suitable alternatives; given no penicillin allergy or prior macrolide exposure history here, bismuth quadruple therapy is the most evidence-based choice for this treatment-naïve patient [^114qTnSw] [^114vB1H5] [^117R9M4E].

> I should double-check the components and dosing to ensure accuracy. Optimized bismuth quadruple therapy consists of a standard-dose PPI twice daily, bismuth subcitrate 120–300 mg or subsalicylate 300 mg four times daily, tetracycline 500 mg four times daily, and metronidazole 500 mg three to four times daily for 14 days; I almost said "metronidazole 500 mg twice daily", but wait, that would underdose it — ACG specifies 500 mg TID or QID to optimize eradication, particularly in the setting of variable nitroimidazole resistance [^114qTnSw] [^115Y1miA].

> Next, I should review why this regimen is favored over the other options. Bismuth quadruple therapy avoids clarithromycin and fluoroquinolones up front, leverages agents with low primary resistance (tetracycline, bismuth), and achieves high eradication rates even in the face of metronidazole resistance when dosed adequately and given for 14 days. In contrast, clarithromycin triple therapy fails frequently with resistance above 15%, and sequential therapy is not recommended as first-line in North America due to inferior performance and resistance concerns [^112wUATa] [^112ALcFZ] [^115Y1miA].

> But wait, what if I considered concomitant non-bismuth quadruple therapy as an equal first-line option? I need to ensure I'm aligning with the most current guidance. While some older pathways listed concomitant therapy as acceptable, ACG 2024 prioritizes bismuth quadruple therapy as preferred empiric therapy and advises against empiric clarithromycin regimens absent susceptibility; thus, concomitant therapy would be a secondary choice here, not the best first-line answer for this patient [^113YpBQm] [^112jtYX7] [^114vB1H5].

> I will now examine patient-specific modifiers. There is no stated penicillin allergy, no prior macrolide or fluoroquinolone exposure, and no prior H. pylori treatment, so amoxicillin- and tetracycline-containing regimens are acceptable; if penicillin allergy were present, I would pivot to bismuth quadruple therapy with metronidazole and tetracycline and avoid amoxicillin, but that is not the case here [^11567qye].

> Next, I should review duration and adherence considerations. Extending therapy to 14 days improves eradication rates across multiple regimens, and for bismuth quadruple therapy specifically, 14 days is the recommended duration. I need to counsel on strict adherence, potential adverse effects such as metallic taste, darkening of stools and tongue, and gastrointestinal upset, and consider strategies to enhance compliance to maximize success [^116VE7dV] [^114qTnSw].

> I need to ensure appropriate follow-up. A test-of-cure with a urea breath test or stool antigen should be performed at least 4 weeks after completing antibiotics and after withholding PPIs for about 2 weeks to avoid false negatives. If the test is positive, I should treat this as refractory infection, review adherence, and select a salvage regimen that avoids previously used antibiotics, with optimized bismuth quadruple therapy or rifabutin-based options as common next steps depending on prior therapy [^112Ruq3K] [^1143Dbyc] [^114vB1H5].

> Putting this together, the most appropriate first-line therapy for this 45-year-old man with H. pylori–positive dyspepsia is optimized bismuth quadruple therapy for 14 days: a standard-dose PPI twice daily, bismuth subcitrate 120–300 mg or subsalicylate 300 mg four times daily, tetracycline 500 mg four times daily, and metronidazole 500 mg three to four times daily, followed by test-of-cure 4 or more weeks later off PPIs. This aligns with current ACG guidance and addresses contemporary resistance patterns while maximizing eradication likelihood [^114qTnSw] [^114vB1H5] [^117R9M4E].

---

The most appropriate first-line therapy for a 45-year-old male with epigastric burning pain and a positive urea breath test is **bismuth quadruple therapy** (PPI, bismuth, tetracycline, metronidazole) for 14 days [^114qTnSw] [^117R9M4E]. This regimen is preferred because it **does not rely on clarithromycin**, which has high resistance rates in the US, and achieves high eradication rates [^112wUATa]. Clarithromycin triple therapy is no longer recommended empirically without susceptibility testing due to resistance [^112jtYX7]. Pantoprazole alone is inadequate, and sulfasalazine is not indicated for H. pylori.

---

## Clinical reasoning and guideline support

- **Bismuth quadruple therapy**: Recommended as first-line therapy by ACG 2024 guidelines, particularly in regions with high clarithromycin resistance (> 15%) [^114qTnSw] [^111btMjB]. This regimen includes a proton pump inhibitor (PPI), bismuth subsalicylate, tetracycline, and metronidazole, administered for 14 days [^114qTnSw] [^117LoDad].

- **Clarithromycin triple therapy**: Historically used, but no longer recommended empirically due to rising resistance rates and reduced efficacy [^112wUATa]. ACG 2024 guidelines explicitly advise against empiric clarithromycin-containing regimens without susceptibility testing [^112jtYX7].

- **Pantoprazole monotherapy**: While pantoprazole may provide symptomatic relief, it does not eradicate H. pylori infection and is therefore insufficient as standalone therapy [^notfound].

- **Sulfasalazine**: Not indicated for H. pylori infection or peptic ulcer disease, and has no role in eradication therapy.

---

## Recommended regimen: bismuth quadruple therapy

| **Medication** | **Dose** | **Frequency** |
|-|-|-|
| Proton pump inhibitor (e.g. omeprazole) | Standard dose | Twice daily |
| Bismuth subsalicylate | 525 mg | Four times daily |
| Tetracycline | 500 mg | Four times daily |
| Metronidazole | 500 mg | Three times daily |

---

Duration: **14 days** [^114vB1H5].

---

## Rationale for bismuth quadruple therapy

- **High efficacy**: Achieves eradication rates exceeding 90% in many settings, even in the presence of metronidazole resistance [^115Y1miA].

- **Resistance considerations**: Does not rely on clarithromycin, addressing the high resistance rates observed in the United States [^112wUATa].

- **Guideline endorsement**: Strongly recommended by ACG 2024 guidelines as the preferred first-line regimen in the absence of susceptibility testing [^117LoDad].

---

## Follow-up and test of cure

After completing therapy, **confirm eradication** with a urea breath test or stool antigen test at least 4 weeks after finishing antibiotics and after withholding PPIs for at least 2 weeks to avoid false negatives [^112Ruq3K] [^1143Dbyc].

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

Given the patient's presentation and positive urea breath test, **bismuth quadruple therapy** is the most appropriate first-line treatment. This regimen aligns with current guidelines, addresses antibiotic resistance concerns, and provides the highest likelihood of successful eradication. Clarithromycin triple therapy is not recommended empirically, pantoprazole alone is insufficient, and sulfasalazine is not indicated.

Comment

As is apparent from statement 8, there is a group of patients with FD for whom H. pylori is considered the cause of their symptoms, and this can be established if eradication is associated with sustained symptom benefit. This scenario is the only one where patients with chronic dyspeptic symptoms and a negative endoscopy can be 'cured', albeit with some delay after successful eradication therapy. Moreover, very few effective alternative therapeutic approaches have been proved to have substantial and sustained benefit in FD. Finally, eradication therapy is a short treatment, with acceptable cost–benefit for controlling dyspeptic symptoms, and with other potential benefits for prevention of peptic ulcer and gastric cancer. Based on these considerations, eradication therapy can be proposed as first-line treatment for H. pylori -infected dyspeptic patients, which is in line with a recent management algorithm by the Rome foundation.

CQ10. How effective is H. pylori eradication on dyspeptic symptoms — in the short and long term — and how does it compare with other treatments (such as proton pump inhibitors (PPIs))?

Statement 10

In H. pylori -infected dyspeptic patients, eradication therapy for dyspeptic symptoms is better than placebo and is the preferred option.

Grade of recommendation: strong

Evidence level: high

Consensus level: 97.4%

Comment

Eradication therapy studies have confirmed that a subset of H. pylori -infected patients with FD is relieved of dyspeptic symptoms by eradication therapy. To date, only a limited number of studies have directly compared eradication therapy with other treatments that are used for FD, such as PPIs or prokinetic therapy. Hence, although the symptomatic gain takes at least 6 months, eradication is the preferred treatment. Future trials should compare eradication with treatment modalities other than placebo in H pylori -infected patients with chronic dyspeptic symptoms and a negative endoscopy.

CQ11. Should patients who remain dyspeptic after successful H. pylori eradication be considered to have FD?

Statement 11

Patients who remain symptomatic after successful H. pylori eradication should be considered to have FD.

Introduction

Choosing a treatment for Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) eradication in a definite geographic area relies on different factors, such as the local availability of antimicrobial agents, the pattern of primary antibiotic resistance, and the therapeutic cost. In a specific patient, the probability of successful therapy is affected by several host and bacterial factors, but patient compliance and bacterial resistance to antibiotics play a major role. Compliance with an eradication therapy, in turn, depends on regimen complexity, tolerability, and the incidence of related side-effects. Good compliance, defined as a concordance of more than 90% between the prescribed and the ingested drugs, significantly increases the eradication rate. The presence of H. pylori strains resistant towards a certain antibiotic is associated with its consumption in the general population, or its previous use in the same patient to treat other infections. A high prevalence of resistance to primary clarithromycin (> 15%) or metronidazole (> 30%) in H. pylori isolates reduces the efficacy of standard first-line therapies that include these drugs. This suggests that efforts in assessing local, regional, and national patterns of antimicrobial resistance should be performed to allow an appropriate selection of H. pylori therapies. However, following standard therapies, bacterial eradication may be achieved in a definite number (up to 38.5%) of patients despite the presence of clarithromycin and/or metronidazole resistance. Indeed, the combination of different synergic antibiotics may allow the resistance towards a specific molecule to be overcome. On the other hand, the infection is not cured in a distinct portion (19.6%) of patients even when susceptible H. pylori strains are present, as several other factors apart from the bacterial susceptibility status are involved. These findings suggest a significant discordance between the expected eradication rate based on antimicrobial resistance assessment in vitro and the actual performance in vivo for each therapy regimen. Therefore, monitoring the efficacy of standard therapies in a particular area, irrespective of the prevalence of antibiotic resistance, is of paramount relevance before a still potentially successful therapy is abandoned.

### First-line therapies foreradication: a critical reappraisal of updated guidelines [^116KeGbE]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) treatment remains a challenge for the clinician, as no available therapy is able to cure the infection in all treated patients. In the last two decades, several antibiotic combinations have been proposed, including triple therapies, bismuth-free therapies (sequential, concomitant, hybrid regimens), and bismuth-based quadruple therapy. Some national and international guidelines on H. pylori management have recently been updated, recommending or discouraging the use of each of these therapeutic approaches, based mainly on the presumed pattern of primary antibiotic resistance in different geographic areas. We examined the recommendations on first-line therapies in the most recently updated guidelines worldwide, taking into account other data affecting the efficacy of a therapy regimen beyond the primary resistance pattern. Although several guidelines highlighted that the results achieved by an eradication therapy are population-specific and not directly transferable, it emerged that some therapy regimens are recommended or discouraged with no mention of the vital need for national data.

### First-line therapies foreradication: a critical reappraisal of updated guidelines [^116SKdRg]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

The pattern of primary bacterial resistance towards different antibiotics may be a cause for concern. Indeed, different guidelines suggest choosing the first-line therapy according to regional or national prevalence of antimicrobial resistance in H. pylori isolates. Specifically, a prevalence rate > 15% for combined resistance towards clarithromycin and metronidazole is recognized as the major factor impairing efficacy of all bismuth-free therapies, whilst an isolate resistance rate > 20% to clarithromycin undermines the efficacy of triple and sequential therapies, but not the concomitant regimen. Nevertheless, at least three meta-analyses, including data from studies performed in areas with different prevalences of antibiotic resistance, have shown a similar efficacy between sequential and concomitant therapies. Therefore, a priori discrimination with respect to a particular therapy based only on the presumed prevalence of bacterial resistance in a geographic area seems to be at least questionable, and local validation of each therapy regimen would be desirable. Indeed, factors beyond the antibiotic resistance pattern could play a role, causing different results in diverse geographic areas. For instance, primary resistance towards either clarithromycin or metronidazole in H. pylori isolates is as high as 30% in Italy, so that the sequential therapy should not be used according to the European guidelines. However, in the last decade, an eradication rate of > 90% has repeatedly been found in all multicenter Italian trials involving thousands of patients, apart from one study published in 2010 where the infection was cured in 83% of 122 patients. When considering only data from studies published in the last 5 years, the cure rate following sequential therapy was still 90–92.6% in 5 Italian studies with more than 1000 patients, and 73% in another study with 100 cases. A similarly high success rate of sequential therapy has been observed in studies recently performed in Slovenia (94.2%), Portugal (90%), Belgium (90%), Israel (95.9%), Thailand (94%), Taiwan (91.9%), Singapore (90.3%), and the United Arab Emirates (88.6%), suggesting that this therapy is still effective in several countries. Based on these findings, Italian, Slovenian, or Portuguese physicians could inopportunely deprive their patients a priori of a still effective therapy by following the European guidelines. In contrast, unsatisfactory cure rates were observed in Greece, Spain, Ireland, Turkey, Iran, Korea, China, and Puerto Rico. Notably, the difference among results achieved by sequential therapy in different geographic areas could be due, at least in part, to the type of nitroimidazole used. In several studies, metronidazole 400 mg b.i.d. has been administered instead of tinidazole 500 mg b.i.d. and it has been found that the tinidazole-based regimen achieved significantly higher cure rates than metronidazole-based sequential therapy. Indeed, apart from the higher dose, tinidazole possesses a markedly higher half-life compared to metronidazole.

Conclusions

Our trial provides evidence that the 10-day BQT is highly effective in eradicating H. pylori as an empirical first-line therapy in Korea. Because the first-line 7-day STT has an unacceptable efficacy, the current Korean guidelines for H. pylori management need to be revised to include BQT as the first-line therapy.

### ACG clinical guideline: treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection [^116aDG31]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

ACG clinical guideline — Recommendation 4: In treatment-naive patients with Helicobacter pylori infection and unknown clarithromycin susceptibility, PCAB-clarithromycin triple therapy is suggested over PPI-clarithromycin triple therapy (conditional recommendation; moderate quality evidence). We advise against the use of clarithromycin in any treatment regimen unless there is evidence that a patient is infected with a clarithromycin-sensitive strain of H. pylori; if susceptibility is not known and there is no history of macrolide use and no alternative first-line therapy is available, evidence supports a 14-day, twice-daily triple regimen that includes clarithromycin and amoxicillin with a potassium-competitive acid blocker (PCAB) instead of a proton pump inhibitor (PPI). In prespecified analyses, vonoprazan-clarithromycin triple therapy was superior among clarithromycin-resistant strains (eradication rates by mITT 66% vs 32%, P < 0.0001) and in the entire study population (mITT 81% vs 69%, P < 0.0003); diarrhea (4%) and dysgeusia (4%) were the most commonly reported adverse events. A network meta-analysis reported vonoprazan-based triple therapy had 72% probability of being the most efficacious.

### Practical aspects in choosing a Helicobacter pylori therapy [^117VF3q6]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Cure rates greater than 90%-95% should be expected with an antimicrobial therapy for Helicobacter pylori infection. Standard triple therapy does not guarantee these efficacy rates in most settings worldwide anymore. The choice of eradication regimen should be dictated by factors that can predict the outcome: (1) H. pylori susceptibility; (2) patients' history of prior antibiotic therapy; and (3) local data, either resistance patterns or clinical success. Currently, the preferred first-line choices are 14-day bismuth quadruple and 14-day non-bismuth quadruple concomitant therapy. Bismuth quadruple (if not used previously), fluoroquinolone-, furazolidone- and rifabutin-containing regimens might be effective rescue treatments.

### Evaluation of acute abdominal pain in adults… [^1165DTYU]. AAFP (2008). Low credibility.

HISTORY When possible, the history should be obtained from a nonsedated patient. 7 The initial differential diagnosis can be determined by a delineation of the pain's location, radiation, and movement. After the location is identified, the physician should obtain general information about onset, duration, severity, and quality of pain and about exacerbating and remitting factors. 5 Peptic ulcer disease is often associated with Helicobacter pylori infection, 8 although most patients do not know their H. pylori status. In addition, many patients with ulcer disease and serology findings negative for H. pylori report recent use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.

Other symptoms of peptic ulcer disease include concurrent, episodic gnawing or burning pain; pain relieved by food; and nighttime awakening with pain. Symptoms in patients with abdominal pain that are suggestive of surgical or emergent conditions include fever, protracted vomiting, syncope or presyncope, and evidence of gastrointestinal blood loss. In patients with epigastric pain, simultaneous amylase and lipase measurements are recommended because an elevated lipase level with a normal amylase level is not likely to be caused by pancreatitis. Older patients with abdominal pain present a particular diagnostic challenge. Disease frequency and severity may be exaggerated in this population. Presentation may differ in older patients, and poor patient recall or a reduction in symptom severity may cause misdiagnosis.

There are several diseases that should be considered in all older patients with abdominal pain because of the increased incidence and high risk of morbidity and mortality in these patients. Occult urinary tract infection, perforated viscus, and ischemic bowel disease are potentially fatal conditions commonly missed or diagnosed late in older patients. Approach to Patients A stepwise approach to abdominal pain requires identification of specific high-risk populations. In low-risk patients, the pain location guides the initial differential diagnosis. Several areas of the abdomen deserve special attention because the clearest evidence for a consistent work-up is in these areas. For right upper quadrant pain, the history focuses on differentiating pulmonary, urinary, and hepatobiliary pain.

### ACG clinical guideline: treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection [^117R9M4E]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Helicobacter pylori infection — treatment-naive patients: In treatment-naive patients with H. pylori infection, optimized bismuth quadruple therapy (BQT) is recommended as a first-line treatment option (strong recommendation; moderate quality evidence). BQT typically comprises a bismuth salt, a nitroimidazole, tetracycline (which is preferred over doxycycline), and a proton pump inhibitor (PPI). BQT is not approved by the US Food and Drug Administration when prescribed separately in its 4 components, and Pylera is dispensed only as a 10-day regimen, whereas Helidac was initially approved with an H2-receptor antagonist for 14 days. We do not recommend the use of H2RAs in treatment regimens for H. pylori infection and do not recommend restricting treatment to those infected patients who have peptic ulcer; therefore, this preparation was not further considered.

### Current concepts in the management of Helicobacter pylori infection: the maastricht III consensus report [^114Q49z7]. Gut (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Guidelines on the management of Helicobacter pylori, which cover indications for management and treatment strategies, were produced in 2000.

Aims

To update the guidelines at the European Helicobacter Study Group (EHSG) Third Maastricht Consensus Conference, with emphasis on the potential of H pylori eradication for the prevention of gastric cancer.

Results

Eradication of H pylori infection is recommended in (a) patients with gastroduodenal diseases such as peptic ulcer disease and low grade gastric, mucosa associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma; (b) patients with atrophic gastritis; (c) first degree relatives of patients with gastric cancer; (d) patients with unexplained iron deficiency anaemia; and (e) patients with chronic idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura. Recurrent abdominal pain in children is not an indication for a "test and treat" strategy if other causes are excluded. Eradication of H pylori infection (a) does not cause gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) or exacerbate GORD, and (b) may prevent peptic ulcer in patients who are naïve users of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). H pylori eradication is less effective than proton pump inhibitor (PPI) treatment in preventing ulcer recurrence in long term NSAID users. In primary care a test and treat strategy using a non-invasive test is recommended in adult patients with persistent dyspepsia under the age of 45. The urea breath test, stool antigen tests, and serological kits with a high accuracy are non-invasive tests which should be used for the diagnosis of H pylori infection. Triple therapy using a PPI with clarithromycin and amoxicillin or metronidazole given twice daily remains the recommended first choice treatment. Bismuth-containing quadruple therapy, if available, is also a first choice treatment option. Rescue treatment should be based on antimicrobial susceptibility.

Conclusion

The global burden of gastric cancer is considerable but varies geographically. Eradication of H pylori infection has the potential to reduce the risk of gastric cancer development.

### ACG clinical guideline: treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection [^112Ruq3K]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Helicobacter pylori treatment — key concepts emphasize prevalence, linked testing-treatment decisions, regimen selection, and follow-up. The prevalence of H. pylori infection in North America remains substantial at 30%–40%. The determination of when to test for — and treat — H. pylori should be viewed as a single, rather than 2 separate and distinct, decisions. Clarithromycin- and levofloxacin-containing treatment regimens should be avoided in the absence of demonstrated macrolide and quinolone susceptibility, respectively. All patients who are treated for H. pylori infection should undergo a test of cure with an appropriately conducted urea breath test, fecal antigen test, or biopsy-based test at least 4 wk after completion of therapy. In treatment-experienced patients with persistent H. pylori infection that is confirmed to be clarithromycin-sensitive, PPI- or PCAB-clarithromycin triple therapy is suggested. Based on expert consensus, we advise using antibiotic susceptibility testing whenever the choice of therapy remains unclear after taking into consideration any previous treatments for H. pylori infection, past antibiotic exposure more generally, and whether there is a documented history of penicillin allergy. PCAB denotes potassium-competitive acid blocker and PPI denotes proton pump inhibitor.

### AGA clinical practice update on the management of refractory Helicobacter pylori infection: expert review [^115g3bHz]. Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Definition of refractory Helicobacter pylori infection — refractory H pylori infection is defined by a persistently positive nonserologic H pylori test result (ie, a breath, stool, or gastroscopy-based test), at least 4 weeks after 1 or more completed course(s) of a current guideline-recommended first-line H pylori eradication therapy, and off of any medications, such as proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs), that might impact the test sensitivity. Refractory H pylori infection should be differentiated from recurrent infection — that is, a nonserologic test that was initially negative after eradication therapy, but then subsequently positive at a later interval — because the latter might be the result of ongoing intrafamilial exposure and may be best addressed by testing household members and treating those who test positive.

### Key points from the revised maastricht consensus report: the impact on general practice [^115d831M]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2001). Low credibility.

The Maastricht 2 Consensus Report features evidence-based recommendations for the management of Helicobacter pylori infection. Strongly recommended indications for H. pylori eradication include duodenal and gastric ulcer, mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma, atrophic gastritis, post gastric cancer resection, first-degree relation to gastric cancer patients, and patient's wishes. Advisable indications include functional dyspepsia, with the statement that eradication can lead to long-term improvement of symptoms in a subset of patients. Because H. pylori eradication does not cause gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) in most patients, or exacerbate existing GORD, H. pylori should be eradicated in patients requiring long-term acid suppression. Also advisable is H. pylori eradication before administration of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), although this alone may be insufficient to reduce recurrent bleeding or enhance ulcer healing in patients receiving antisecretory therapy who continue to take NSAIDs. Maastricht 2 also introduced the concept of the 'treatment package' that considers first- and second-line eradication therapies together. A 'search and treat' strategy should be considered in patients with peptic ulcers; for patients with uncomplicated duodenal ulcer, administration of proton pump inhibitors can be limited to the period of antibiotic treatment.

In patients who have previously failed eradication therapy, the choice of rescue therapy should consider initial antibiotic susceptibility status and the first-line regimens employed; where possible, rescue therapy should be based on antibiotic resistance profiles, and antibiotics with a high likelihood of the infecting strain to develop secondary resistance (eg, clarithromycin, metronidazole) should be avoided if they were employed in the initial regimen.

For treatment-experienced patients with persistent H. pylori infection and unknown antibiotic susceptibility who have not previously received optimized BQT, optimized BQT for 14 days is preferred; in those previously treated with optimized BQT, rifabutin triple therapy for 14 days is a suitable empiric alternative.

Second-line therapies for H. pylori infection

A standard bismuth quadruple therapy, a fluoroquinolone-containing quadruple (or triple) therapy or a PPI-amoxicillin high-dose dual therapy have been recommended as second-line treatment for H. pylori infection by the Maastricht VI/Florence Consensus Report. Recently, tetracycline-levofloxacin quadruple therapy and vonoprazan-based therapy have proposed to increase the eradication rate. Table 1 lists the regimens and durations of these recommended second-line therapies.

Table 1.
Regimens for second-line anti- H. pylori therapy.

To investigate the efficacies of current second-line eradication regimens, randomized controlled trials published in English language articles reporting the eradication rates of second-line anti- H. pylori therapy were eligible for literature search. The status of H. pylori infection before and after treatment should be verified by at least one of the following tests: urea breath test, rapid urease test, histology or culture. The post-treatment H. pylori status should be assessed at least 4 weeks after eradication therapies. Medical literatures were searched from PubMed (1 March 2013–1 March 2023). We identified the eligible literatures with the keywords of ' Helicobacter pylori ' or ' H. pylori ' or ' H pylori ', and 'therapy' or 'treatment'. 'Clinical trial' was set as filter. The titles and abstracts were screened by CAS and CBS to exclude irrelevant studies. The full articles of potentially eligible studies were further reviewed by CAS and CBS. Literatures published in the abstract form only were excluded. Studies that did not report the results according to the intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses were also excluded. Two investigators, CAS and CBS, reviewed the literatures under the above criteria independently using pre-designed data extraction form. Disagreements were resolved through discussion with PIH to reach consensus. Figure 1 shows the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses flow diagram of the literature search. Table 2 summarizes the intention-to-treat and per-protocol eradication rates of various H. pylori eradication regimens including standard bismuth quadruple therapy (tetracycline-metronidazole quadruple therapy), fluoroquinolone-amoxicillin triple therapy, fluoroquinolone-amoxicillin quadruple therapy, tetracycline-fluoroquinolone quadruple therapy, high-dose dual therapy, levofloxacin-based sequential therapy, tetracycline-metronidazole-amoxicillin concomitant therapy, furazolidone-tetracycline quadruple therapy, furazolidone-amoxicillin quadruple therapy, amoxicillin-clarithromycin-metronidazole tetracycline quintuple therapy, and tetracycline-metronidazole-ofloxacin quintuple therapy.–

Rifabutin triple therapy for treatment-naive Helicobacter pylori — In treatment-naive patients with H. pylori infection, rifabutin triple therapy is suggested as a first-line treatment option (conditional recommendation; low quality evidence). Rifabutin triple therapy consists of a PPI, rifabutin, and amoxicillin. Evidence quality notes include that in a meta-analysis only one of the 8 randomized trials was adequately blinded, and in the United States only 1 rifabutin-based triple regimen (Talicia) is approved by the FDA for the treatment of H. pylori infection in adults.

Susceptibility testing after repeated therapy failure (BPA #10) — The published literature provides little to no evidence that sensitivity-based treatment selection improves H pylori eradication over empirically selected second-line regimens, and a note of caution is still warranted when embarking on therapy directed by susceptibility testing. In the absence of such data, the Maastricht strategy of susceptibility testing after 2 unsuccessful therapies should be considered in most cases, and high-quality clinical trials of tailored vs empiric therapy after 2 or more failed attempts at eradication are lacking in the United States.

### First-line therapies foreradication: a critical reappraisal of updated guidelines [^117195uG]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

According to the evidence-based medicine approach, guidelines represent an undeniable advantage for the management of H. pylori infection in clinical practice. However, several factors are involved in the efficacy of a specific therapy regimen, including some specific host-bacteria interactions, which may be peculiar to different geographic areas. Indeed, the European guidelines clearly highlighted that the results achieved by an eradication therapy are population-specific and not directly transferable. Therefore, at least the therapeutic aspects are more appropriately addressed in national than in other guidelines, providing that data from national trials are opportunely considered.

Undeniably, the role of primary resistance is relevant, but antimicrobial resistance in vitro does not always correlate with poor results from multi-drug treatment regimens. Indeed, it should be considered that all therapy regimens include a combination of antibiotics with a potentially synergistic effect that can overcome the resistance to a single molecule. Unfortunately, the infection is not cured in all cases, even using only those antibiotics with a proven susceptibility, as demonstrated in bacterial culture-based studies. A meta-analysis of 12 studies found an eradication rate of 89.2% (95%CI = 87.1–91.3) in 860 patients, despite the use of a therapy tailored according to susceptibility testing results. Therefore, even if primary resistance status towards clarithromycin or levofloxacin could be assessed prior to first-line therapy, using novel stool tests based on the polymerase chain reaction technique, bacterial eradication is not guaranteed. Similarly, under the empirical administration of a 14-day bismuth–tetracycline–amoxicillin combination, three drugs with no or a very low (< 5%) primary resistance rate to H. pylori isolates, the eradication rate was as low as 43%.

Keeping in mind that novel antibiotics against H. pylori are not available, the use of those regimens with proven efficacy in a specific geographic area would appear judicious, before abandoning a therapy a priori, considering only the bacterial resistance pattern. Last but not least, the therapeutic cost of different regimens should be taken into account when considering the vast diffusion of H. pylori infection worldwide. In those areas where the efficacy of different therapies is similar (± 5%) the cost of drugs may be a cause for concern (Table 4), and specific cost-effectiveness studies are needed.

Regarding medical management for Helicobacter pylori infection, more specifically with respect to management of treatment failure, choice of regimen, AGA 2021 guidelines recommend to choose one of the following second-line options by shared decision-making between providers and patients if bismuth quadruple therapy failed as a first-line treatment:

- levofloxacin- or rifabutin-based triple-therapy regimens with high-dose dual PPI and amoxicillin

- an alternative bismuth-containing quadruple therapy.

### ACG clinical guideline: treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection [^116v4nbG]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Indications for Helicobacter pylori testing and treatment — test-and-treat strategy and follow-up are outlined. Testing for, and treatment of, H. pylori infection should be viewed as dependent rather than independent actions, and therefore all patients with an indication for testing should be offered effective treatment if confirmed to have active infection — and should subsequently undergo a test-of-cure after treatment. The "test-and-treat" approach for uninvestigated dyspepsia is reasonable in patients under the age of 60 years, without alarm features and without other indications for endoscopy. In patients with functional dyspepsia, eradication of H. pylori infection only provides modest benefit.

### ACG clinical guideline: treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection [^115XaEn9]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection is a common worldwide infection that is an important cause of peptic ulcer disease and gastric cancer. H. pylori may also have a role in uninvestigated and functional dyspepsia, ulcer risk in patients taking low-dose aspirin or starting therapy with a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medication, unexplained iron deficiency anemia, and idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura. While choosing a treatment regimen for H. pylori, patients should be asked about previous antibiotic exposure and this information should be incorporated into the decision-making process. For first-line treatment, clarithromycin triple therapy should be confined to patients with no previous history of macrolide exposure who reside in areas where clarithromycin resistance amongst H. pylori isolates is known to be low. Most patients will be better served by first-line treatment with bismuth quadruple therapy or concomitant therapy consisting of a PPI, clarithromycin, amoxicillin, and metronidazole. When first-line therapy fails, a salvage regimen should avoid antibiotics that were previously used. If a patient received a first-line treatment containing clarithromycin, bismuth quadruple therapy or levofloxacin salvage regimens are the preferred treatment options. If a patient received first-line bismuth quadruple therapy, clarithromycin or levofloxacin-containing salvage regimens are the preferred treatment options. Details regarding the drugs, doses and durations of the recommended and suggested first-line and salvage regimens can be found in the guideline.

Methods

Data review, assessment of evidence and revision of consensus statements

The IHPWG met on 22 June 2023, to discuss the recent literature and national data relating to the management of H. pylori. It was agreed that there was a need to update the Irish guidelines. Using a similar approach to that of the Maastricht VI guidelines, the Delphi process was used to develop revised consensus statements in relation to three key domains: diagnosis of H. pylori infection in symptomatic adults (domain 1), first-line treatment of H. pylori infection (domain 2) and second-line and rescue therapy for H. pylori infection (domain 3). First, this involved an in-depth review of the recent relevant national data, the published literature and current European and international guidelines to identify the best evidence to support each recommendation. Revised recommendations were drafted and shared with the group. On 29 November 2023, group members were asked to vote on whether they agreed with each recommendation. If there was < 80% agreement with the relevance of a recommendation, it was re-phrased, and another vote took place. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach was used to rate the quality of the available evidence and the strength of the resulting recommendations according to the criteria in Table 1. Aspects related to the implementation of the recommendations in clinical practise in Ireland were also considered. The resulting recommendations are summarised in Table 2.

Clarithromycin-based triple therapies

In the last two decades, H. pylori treatment has been largely focused on triple therapies based on clarithromycin, which is the most powerful antibiotic against H. pylori strains. To date, there is well documented evidence regarding the decreasing efficacy of these regimens as a result of the increased prevalence of primary resistance to clarithromycin and metronidazole. Following standard 7-day triple therapies, an eradication rate less than 80% has repeatedly been reported in several countries, so that a 14-day regimen has been proposed to improve the success rate. A recent Cochrane systematic review and a large network meta-analysis found that the prolonged 14-day regimen achieves a higher eradication rate compared to the 7- and 10-day schedules, although the therapeutic gain was only +8%. However, a 7-day triple therapy is still recommended in all Eastern guidelines apart from the Chinese, mainly depending on a particular prescriptive policy for antimicrobial drugs (Table 1). Conversely, among western guidelines, only one suggests the use of a 7-day triple therapy, whilst European, American and Canadian, but not Spanish, guidelines conditionally recommend a 14-day regimen, limiting its use in those geographic areas to low (< 15%) clarithromycin resistance and for patients not previously exposed to macrolides (Table 2). Surprisingly, the use of a 14-day triple therapy is still suggested in the Italian guidelines, even though the primary clarithromycin resistance rate is definitely > 15% in Italy. Moreover, there are only 3 studies on 14-day triple therapy performed in Italy, which concordantly found that the success rate was lower than 75% and 80% in intention-to-treat (ITT) and per-protocol analyses, respectively (Table 3). Unfortunately, the eradication rate of 14-day triple therapy was not significantly increased even by using a double-dose proton-pump inhibitor (PPI) (i.e. esomeprazole 40 mg b.i.d.). Therefore, the recommendation for using a 14-day triple therapy in the updated Italian guidelines would appear at least questionable. For instance, based on the disappointing results of national studies, the Spanish guidelines wisely excluded 14-day triple therapies from the recommended treatments. In contrast, in Latin America, the cure rate following the 14-day clarithromycin–amoxicillin triple therapy (82.2%) was higher than that of either concomitant (73.6%) or sequential (76.5%) therapies, most probably because of the very high (> 80%) prevalence of metronidazole resistance in the H. pylori strains. Therefore, the same therapy regimen may be more successful in a specific geographic area than in another.

Diagnosis and treatment of H. pylori

H. pylori should be tested in patients with dyspepsia if the local H. pylori prevalence exceeds 10%. The testing can be performed by noninvasive and invasive methods. The noninvasive methods include the urea breath tests and fecal antigen test. Serologic test and invasive testing strategies require upper endoscopy, biopsy urease (campylobacter-like organism) test, histologic assessment, and culture.

The eradication of H. pylori dramatically decreases the presence of premalignant lesions and reduce the GC risk in infected individuals. Anti- H. pylori therapy is an effective means for GC prevention and there are various proposed treatment regimens for H. pylori eradication. Traditional treatment regimens include standard triple therapy (PPI, amoxicillin, and clarithromycin), bismuth quadruple PBMT therapy (PPI, bismuth, metronidazole, and tetracycline), or a treatment including PPI, clarithromycin, and metronidazole. However, with increasing clarithromycin resistance, another regimen concomitant nonbismuth therapy PAMC (PPI, amoxicillin, metronidazole, and clarithromycin) was proposed. The first-line treatment was recommended with a 14-day course of either concomitant PAMC therapy or bismuth quadruple PBMT therapy, according to the 2016 Toronto Consensus guidelines. The 2016 Maastricht V/Florence Consensus Report recommends first-line treatment with a 14-day course of bismuth quadruple PBMT therapy or concomitant PAMC therapy in high clarithromycin resistance areas (> 15% resistance). A standard triple therapy or bismuth quadruple PBMT therapy in low clarithromycin resistance (< 15% resistance) areas is also proposed by this report.

### Optimum duration of regimens for Helicobacter pylori eradication [^116VE7dV]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

The optimal duration for Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) eradication therapy is controversial, with recommendations ranging from 7 to 14 days. Several systematic reviews have attempted to address this issue but have given conflicting results and limited their analysis to proton pump inhibitor (PPI), two antibiotics (PPI triple) therapy. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the optimal duration of multiple H. pylori eradication regimens.

Objectives

The primary objective was to assess the relative effectiveness of different durations (7, 10 or 14 days) of a variety of regimens for eradicating H. pylori. The primary outcome was H. pylori persistence. The secondary outcome was adverse events.

Search Methods

The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CINAHL were searched up to December 2011 to identify eligible randomised controlled trials (RCTs). We also searched the proceedings of six conferences from 1995 to 2011, dissertations and theses, and grey literature. There were no language restrictions applied to any search.

Selection Criteria

Only parallel group RCTs assessing the efficacy of one to two weeks duration of first line H. pylori eradication regimens in adults were eligible. Within each regimen, the same combinations of drugs at the same dose were compared over different durations. Studies with at least two arms comparing 7, 10, or 14 days were eligible. Enrolled participants needed to be diagnosed with at least one positive test for H. pylori on the basis of a rapid urease test (RUT), histology, culture, urea breath test (UBT), or a stool antigen test (HpSA) before treatment. Eligible trials needed to confirm eradication of H. pylori as their primary outcome at least 28 days after completion of eradication treatment. Trials using only serology or a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to determine H. pylori infection or eradication were excluded.

Data Collection and Analysis

Study eligibility and data extraction were performed by two independent review authors. Data analyses were performed within each type of intervention, for both primary and secondary outcomes. The relative risk (RR) and number needed to treat (NNT)/number needed to harm (NNTH) according to duration of therapy were calculated using the outcomes of H. pylori persistence and adverse events. A random-effects model was used. Subgroup analyses and sensitivity analyses were planned a priori.

Main Results

In total, 75 studies met the inclusion criteria. Eight types of regimens were reported with at least two comparative eligible durations. They included: PPI + two antibiotics triple therapy (n = 59), PPI bismuth-based quadruple therapy (n = 6), PPI + three antibiotics quadruple therapy (n = 1), PPI dual therapy (n = 2), histamine H2-receptor antagonist (H₂RA) bismuth quadruple therapy (n = 3), H₂RA bismuth-based triple therapy (n = 2), H₂RA + two antibiotics triple therapy (n = 3), and bismuth + two antibiotics triple therapy (n = 2). Some studies provided data for more than one regimen or more than two durations. For the PPI triple therapy, 59 studies with five regimens were reported: PPI + clarithromycin + amoxicillin (PCA); PPI + clarithromycin + a nitroimidazole (PCN); PPI + amoxicillin + nitroimidazole (PAN); PPI + amoxicillin + a quinolone (PAQ); and PPI + amoxicillin + a nitrofuran (PANi). Regardless of type and dose of antibiotics, increased duration of PPI triple therapy from 7 to 14 days significantly increased the H. pylori eradication rate (45 studies, 72.9% versus 81.9%), the RR for H. pylori persistence was 0.66 (95% CI 0.60 to 0.74), NNT was 11 (95% CI 9 to 14). Significant effects were seen in the subgroup of PCA (34 studies, RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.75; NNT 12, 95% CI 9 to 16); PAN (10 studies, RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.86; NNT = 11, 95% CI 8 to 25); and in PAQ (2 studies, RR 0.37, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.83; NNT 3, 95% CI 2 to 10); but not in PCN triple therapy (4 studies, RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.07). Significantly increased eradication rates were also seen for PPI triple therapy with 10 versus 7 days (24 studies, 79.9% versus 75.7%; RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.89; NNT 21, 95% CI 15 to 38) and 14 versus 10 days (12 studies, 84.4% versus 78.5%; RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.58 to 0.90; NNT 17, 95% CI 11 to 46); especially in the subgroup of PAC for 10 versus 7 days (17 studies, RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.70 to 0.91) and for 14 versus 10 days (10 studies, RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.91). A trend towards increased H. pylori eradication rates was seen with increased duration of PCN for 10 versus 7 days, and of PAN for 10 versus 7 days and 14 versus 10 days, though this was not statistical significant. The proportion of patients with adverse events, defined by authors, was marginally significantly increased only between 7 days and 14 days (15.5% versus 19.4%; RR 1.21, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.37; NNTH 31, 95% CI 18 to 104) but not for other duration comparisons. The proportion of patients discontinuing treatment due to adverse events was not significantly different between treatment durations. Only limited data were reported for different durations of regimens other than PPI triple therapy. No significant difference of the eradication rate was seen for all regimens according to different durations except for H₂RA bismuth quadruple therapy, where a significantly higher eradication rate was seen for 14 days versus 7 days, however only one study reported outcome data.

Authors' Conclusions

Increasing the duration of PPI-based triple therapy increases H. pylori eradication rates. For PCA, prolonging treatment duration from 7 to 10 or from 10 to 14 days is associated with a significantly higher eradication rate. The optimal duration of therapy for PCA and PAN is at least 14 days. More data are needed to confirm if there is any benefit of increasing the duration of therapy for PCN therapy. Information is limited for regimens other than PPI triple therapy; more studies are needed to draw meaningful conclusions for optimal duration of other H. pylori eradication regimens.

### Effective and safe proton pump inhibitor therapy in acid-related diseases – A position paper addressing benefits and potential harms of acid suppression [^112Ya1v5]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Summary of the current evidence

PPI therapy in both uninvestigated and functional dyspepsia (FD) is widespread. Indeed, these drugs represent a key component of all the currently employed H. pylori eradication regimens. The search for and eradication of the infection is the first line therapy in the young dyspeptic patient without alarm symptoms. In those patients with persisting symptoms despite successful eradication or naïve-uninfected patients with epigastric pain syndrome (EPS), short-term 4–8 week PPI treatment should be attempted. Finally, PPI co-therapy is indicated in patients with NSAID-associated dyspepsia, also with the aim of preventing GI events.

Dyspepsia is a common GI condition seen in clinical practice. It is not a single disease, but rather a complex of symptoms referable to the upper GI tract that often overlaps with other disease entities. In front of a patient with dyspeptic complaints, physicians should carefully evaluate the history and perform a physical examination in order to assume that symptoms arise from the upper GI tract. If the patient is young (< 45 years), and there are no alarm symptoms, endoscopy and/or functional investigations are usually not performed, the condition is labeled as "uninvestigated" dyspepsia and treatment is empiric. On the contrary, if endoscopy does reveal a structural abnormality, management of dyspepsia relies on treatment of the underlying disease (e.g. PU, reflux esophagitis, or malignancy). When endoscopy is negative (which is the case in more than 70% of patients with dyspeptic symptoms), FD could be considered and, provided Rome IV criteria are fulfilled, the final diagnosis can be confirmed.

FD is characterized by a continuous or frequently recurring epigastric pain or discomfort centered in the upper abdomen for which no organic cause can be determined. According to the most updated Rome IV classification, dyspepsia is subdivided into postprandial distress syndrome (PDS, including fullness, early satiety, nausea) and epigastric pain syndrome (EPS, including epigastric pain or epigastric burning). However, symptom overlap with either GERD or irritable bowel syndrome is not infrequent.

FD is widely prevalent in the general population − up to 15% in Italy − so that FD patients are frequently managed in clinical practice by both general practitioners and gastroenterologists. Since the etiology of FD remains unclear and is probably heterogeneous, no definite single treatment is currently available for these patients. Indeed, different therapeutic approaches have been proposed.

### Should quinolones come first in Helicobacter pylori therapy? [^112C5Bfx]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

New generations of fluoroquinolones, like levofloxacin and moxifloxacin, exhibit a broad-spectrum activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, and have been successfully introduced into the treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection. Based on a large body of evidence, current guidelines recommend the use of levofloxacin- or moxifloxacin-containing proton-pump inhibitor (PPI) triple therapies in second-line or rescue treatment of H. pylori infection. The efficacy of standard PPI triple therapies has substantially declined during the last decade, mainly due to increasing resistance against the key antibiotics clarithromycin and metronidazole. Therefore, alternative strategies for first-line therapy of H. pylori infection have been evaluated in a considerable number of clinical trials including sequential regimens, nonbismuth quadruple regimens, and quinolone-containing PPI triple therapy regimens. The aim of this paper is to summarize the current body of evidence of levofloxacin- and moxifloxacin-containing regimens in first-line treatment of H. pylori infection, and to discuss the risks and benefits of these strategies in the light of increasing resistance of H. pylori to quinolones.

### AGA clinical practice update on functional heartburn: expert review [^116o2UJh]. Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

AGA Clinical Practice Update — diagnosis and evaluation of functional heartburn should be considered when retrosternal burning pain or discomfort persists despite maximal (double-dose) proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy taken appropriately before meals during a 3-month period, and a diagnosis requires upper endoscopy with esophageal biopsies to rule out anatomic and mucosal abnormalities, esophageal high-resolution manometry to rule out major motor disorders, and pH monitoring off PPI therapy (or pH-impedance monitoring on therapy in patients with proven gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)) to document physiologic distal esophageal acid exposure with absence of reflux–symptom association (ie, negative symptom index and symptom association probability); overlap with proven GERD is diagnosed accurately when heartburn persists despite maximal PPI therapy in a patient with a history of proven GERD and pH-impedance testing on PPI therapy demonstrates physiologic acid exposure without reflux–symptom association.

### Is there any correlation between 13C-urea breath test values and response to first-line and rescue Helicobacter pylori eradication therapies? [^111pZZLP]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2006). Low credibility.

Aim

To study if there is a correlation between 13C-urea breath test values prior to treatment and the response to first-line and rescue Helicobacter pylori eradication therapies.

Methods

Six-hundred patients with peptic ulcer or functional dyspepsia infected by H. pylori were prospectively studied. Pre-treatment H. pylori infection was established by 13C-urea breath test. Three-hundred and twelve patients were treated with first-line eradication regimen, and 288 received a rescue regimen. H. pylori eradication was defined as a negative 13C-urea breath test, 8 weeks after completion of treatment.

Results

H. pylori eradication was achieved in 444 patients. No statistically significant differences were demonstrated when mean delta 13C-urea breath test values were compared between patients with eradication success and failure (49.4 ± 33 versus 49.2 ± 31). Differences in mean pre-treatment delta 13CO2 between patients with eradication success/failure were not demonstrated either when first-line or rescue regimens were prescribed. With the cut-off point of pre-treatment delta 13CO2 set at 35 units, sensitivity and specificity for the prediction of H. pylori eradication success was 43 and 60%. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve evaluating all the cut-off points of the pre-treatment delta 13CO2 for the diagnosis of H. pylori eradication was 0.5. Finally, delta 13CO2 values did not influence the eradication in the logistic regression model.

Conclusion

No correlation was observed between 13C-urea breath test values before treatment and the response to first-line and rescue H. pylori eradication therapies. Therefore, we conclude that the quantification of delta 13CO2 prior to treatment is not useful to predict the success or failure of eradicating therapy.

### ACG clinical guideline: treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection [^115Z1Kqh]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Antibiotic susceptibility testing — key concept 6 — H. pylori antibiotic susceptibility tests using either phenotypic (culture-based) or molecular methods (polymerase chain reaction [PCR] or next-generation sequencing [NGS]) are becoming increasingly available in the United States. The incremental benefit of selecting an eradication regimen "tailored" to the antibiotic susceptibility profile compared with empiric selection of eradication therapy remains to be adequately defined and studied — for both treatment-naive and treatment-experienced patients. Based on expert consensus, we advise using antibiotic susceptibility testing whenever the choice of therapy remains unclear after taking into consideration any previous treatments for H. pylori infection, past antibiotic exposure more generally, and whether there is a documented history of penicillin allergy.

### AGA clinical practice update on the management of refractory Helicobacter pylori infection: expert review [^111Y5Gb5]. Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

AGA Clinical Practice Update — Best Practice Advice 1–4 for refractory Helicobacter pylori (H pylori) infection emphasize that the usual cause is antibiotic resistance and that providers should assess for other contributors including adherence and acid suppression. Providers should conduct a thorough review of prior antibiotic exposures and avoid clarithromycin- or levofloxacin-based regimens if there is prior macrolide or fluoroquinolone use, whereas resistance to amoxicillin, tetracycline, and rifabutin is rare and these can be considered. Education and adherence support are advised by explaining the rationale for therapy, dosing instructions, expected adverse events, and the importance of completing the full course. If bismuth quadruple therapy failed as a first-line treatment, shared decision making should guide selection between levofloxacin- or rifabutin-based triple therapy with high-dose dual proton pump inhibitor (PPI) and amoxicillin, or an alternative bismuth-containing quadruple therapy as second-line options.

### Helicobacter pylori: diagnosis and treatment [^111HNDXs]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Multiple diagnostic methods and treatment strategies have been developed to detect and treat the Helicobacter pylori infection. Many of them have stood the test of time; others lost their value with the introduction of new test and treatment modalities. This review focuses on the current diagnostic methods and their clinical implications, as well as on established and novel treatment strategies.

Recent Findings

The increasing antimicrobial resistance has resulted in a decline of the success rate of recommended eradication regimens. The current guidelines recommend as first-line treatment clarithromycin, amoxicillin or metronidazole, and proton pump inhibitor twice daily, but recent studies have demonstrated an increasing eradication failure with these regimens. Several treatment modifications have been adopted regarding duration and combination of substances.

Summary

The currently recommended first-line treatments are effective and well tolerated. In areas with high antimicrobial resistance rates, new antibiotic combinations and modifications in the sequence of drug administration are proposed as alternative treatment options to standard triple therapy. Future treatment strategies have to focus on regional antimicrobial resistance adopted treatment selection and the development of new antibiotics.

### First-line therapies foreradication: a critical reappraisal of updated guidelines [^115wTran]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Since the 1990s, different national and international guidelines for the management of patients with H. pylori infection have been introduced and periodically updated. Undeniably, recommendations on some issues are universally applicable to different geographic areas, such as those concerning the indications for treatment, or diagnostic procedures. For instance, H. pylori infection should be searched for in all patients with a peptic ulcer, irrespectively of the country where they are living. Likewise, the accuracy of noninvasive or invasive tests does not change among patients of different geographic areas. Therefore, guidelines on diagnosis and clinical issues may be applicable in all countries. In contrast, the efficacy of a therapy regimen may be affected by local or regional host/bacterial peculiarities. Consequently, recommendations on therapeutic approaches are more appropriately addressed in national rather than international guidelines, provided that data from national studies are considered.

Based on all these considerations, we aimed to examine the most recently updated guidelines worldwide, focusing our attention on first-line therapy recommendations for H. pylori eradication. Specifically, we considered European, NICE, Italian, Spanish American and Canadian guidelines for Western countries, and Asian, Australian, Japanese, and Chinese guidelines for Eastern countries.

### Levofloxacin or clarithromycin-based quadruple regimens: what is the best alternative as first-line treatment for Helicobacter pylori eradication in a country with high resistance rates for both antibiotics? [^117S9jwL]. BMC Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is a Gram negative, microaerophilic bacterium that is presumed to infect from one-third to over half of the world's population. It is known to be a major responsible for a significant number of gastric pathologies, but its role in extra-gastric diseases is also becoming well documented. H. pylori leads to an inflammatory state, induces molecular mimicry and alters the absorbance of several nutrients. These discoveries are increasing physicians' awareness to the need to eradicate this bacterium.

Initially, the adopted treatment to eradicate H. pylori, the so-called 'legacy' triple therapy with a proton-pump inhibitor (PPI), Clarithromycin and Amoxicillin was quite effective. However, in the last 10 years, its' efficacy has decreased to unacceptable levels in many countries, especially due to increasing levels of bacterial resistance. Excessive and misjudged use of antibiotics contributed to this decreased susceptibility, leading to 50% resistance rates to Clarithromycin in the central region of Portugal (primary 21.4%; secondary 88.3%). Accordingly, current guidelines recommend bismuth-containing quadruple therapies or, alternatively, sequential or non-bismuth quadruple therapy, if Clarithromycin resistance is above the 15–20% threshold. Unfortunately, H. pylori antibiotic resistance has reached alarming levels not only for macrolides but also to other drugs. Metronidazole resistance has been stable in Europe, reaching 34.9% of H. pylori isolates. Fortunately, its impact on the success of eradication regimens is limited, as it can be overcome by prolonging duration of treatment or increasing the dosage of Metronidazole. Despite obtaining adequate eradication rates, standard sequential treatment should not be prescribed if the combined Clarithromycin and Metronidazole resistance is over 5% (which is the case in several European countries). To overcome these problems, some physicians prefer prescribing an adapted sequential treatment with Levofloxacin instead of Clarithromycin, as quinolones have been suggested as an alternative in both first- and second-line regimens. Patients with reported history of penicillin allergy were also often prescribed with such regimens. Regrettably, resistance rates to quinolones also reached worrisome figures in Portugal and in Europe, reflecting its ubiquitous use for minor respiratory and urinary infections. According to Almeida et al, overall resistance to Levofloxacin in the center of Portugal is currently 33.9% (primary: 26.2%; secondary: 44.2%). Facing such adverse ecological scenario, our aim was to compare the efficacy of Clarithromycin and Levofloxacin-based sequential quadruple therapies as first-line treatment options and determine factors associated with treatment failure.

### Best treatment approach: should a national consensus be the best consensus? [^114F7fTP]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

A significant number of national and international consensuses have been published in the literature during recent years concerning the treatment of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori). These guidelines are aimed toward achieving an extremely high cure rate (≥ 90%), which seems to be unachievable in real-world settings, especially in areas with high clarithromycin resistance, such as southern Europe. Times change quickly and, as with other infectious diseases, we are moving inevitably from a trial-and-error therapeutic approach to a susceptibility-based one. Empirical first-line treatments should be based on what works best in each geographical and/or national area and must take into account the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance in each region.

We have reviewed the basic conclusive suggestions from the existing guidelines and consensuses worldwide concerning the best anti- H. pylori treatment approach in relation to antibiotic resistance (Table 1). According to this global plethora of recommendations, it is worth remembering that the determinants of a successful H. pylori eradication could be divided into host-related (e.g. previous antibiotic exposure, patient's adherence to a multi-drug regimen and/or genetic factors) and H. pylori -related factors, with antibiotic sensitivity appearing to be the most important and consistent predictor of success, both in clinical trials and in population-based studies of H. pylori eradication. Thus, it is of major importance for a country's clinical practitioners to know the local pattern of resistance. It seems apparent that an international consensus should play a major role in a specialist's decision making, but it also appears quite reasonable and inevitable that a national consensus, based on nationwide surveys of first-line, second-line and rescue therapies, as well as the local prevalence of antibiotic resistance, should play the major role in each clinician's judgment. In a recently published review, De Francesco et al provided a critical reappraisal of updated worldwide guidelines. The authors fairly concluded that, although several of these guidelines highlighted that the results being achieved by an eradication therapy are population-specific and not directly transferable to another one, it emerged that some therapeutic regimens are recommended or discouraged with no mention of the need to consult existing national data. However, if solid susceptibility data are available for a specific population, then one could recommend or reject various therapeutic regimens for this population, because antimicrobial resistance seems to represent the key factor adversely affecting the outcome of eradication treatment. Nevertheless, each national study group and consensus panel should avoid taking isolated data from one study in a specific region of the country and arbitrarily generalizing them to the entire country's population. On the other hand, this extrapolation seems to be generally accepted for one country if its susceptibility pattern has been thoroughly defined.

Methods

Study design

This study was a single center, open-label, and randomized trial that was conducted at the National Cancer Center, Korea. The institutional review board at the National Cancer Center approved the trial protocol (approval number: NCC2015–0207), and written informed consent was obtained from all participants before enrollment. The trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (number: NCT02557932).

Participants

Adult participants (aged ≥ 18 years) were eligible if they had confirmed H. pylori infection and one of following conditions: family history of gastric cancer, post-endoscopic resection state for early gastric cancer or adenoma, peptic ulcer disease, or chronic gastritis with non-ulcer dyspepsia. The exclusion criteria included the following: previous H. pylori therapy, history of gastrectomy, cancer of another organ in the last 5 years before enrollment, serious concomitant illnesses, contraindication or allergy history of trial medications, and pregnancy.

The H. pylori infection status of the participants at enrollment was evaluated with urea breath test, histological examination by Wright-Giemsa staining of biopsy specimens, and/or rapid urease test. Positive H. pylori infection status was confirmed as positivity of any of the following conditions: (1) urea breath test, (2) histological test of at least two biopsy sites, or (3) histological test of one biopsy site with rapid urease test.

### "Concomitant" or "sequential" eradication of: which regimen comes first? [^112xYL69]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Summary

"Sequential" or "concomitant" non-bismuth quadruple regimens are currently recommended by the recent updated (Maastricht IV) European guidelines as alternative to bismuth based quadruple regimen first line therapies, in areas with a high rate (over 20%) of clarithromycin resistance. Besides this, there is no trial comparing both regimens in settings with increasing rates of clarithromycin resistance. In a recent prospective, randomized, multicenter, clinical trial, conducted in Spain, McNicholl et al aimed to compare the effectiveness and safety of these therapies for Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) eradication.

They included a large number of patients (n = 338) with non-investigated/functional dyspepsia (80%) or peptic ulcer disease (20%), naïve to eradication therapy. Mean age was 47 years, 60% were women and 20% smokers. They were randomly assigned to sequential treatment; omeprazole (20 mg/12 h) and amoxycilline (1 g/12 h) for 5 days, followed by 5 days of omeprazole (20 mg/12 h), clarithromycin (500 mg/12 h) and metronidazole (500 mg/12 h)[170 patients (50.3%)] or concomitant treatment; same drugs at the same doses taken concomitantly for 10 days [168 patients (49.7%)]. Eradication was confirmed with 13 C-urea breath test or histology (depending on the indication), at least 4 weeks after treatment. Treatment related adverse events and adherence to treatment were also carefully evaluated.

### The second Irish Helicobacter pylori working group consensus for the diagnosis and treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection in adult patients in Ireland [^112sHfyo]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Statement 13: for those with persistent Helicobacter pylori infection following unsuccessful eradication attempts, there is no current evidence-based guideline on appropriate follow-up. The IHPWG consensus is that endoscopic surveillance with ESGE-recommended mapping biopsies for precancerous changes should be considered at an interval of 5–10 years from last failed treatment

Recommendation: strong; quality of evidence: low.

Mainly due to poor patient compliance and the increasing prevalence of antimicrobial resistance, H. pylori treatment failure has become more common leading to challenges in H. pylori management. Over decades, H. pylori gastritis may progress through a cascade of precancerous stages from intestinal metaplasia, followed by dysplasia and finally carcinoma. Evidence-based recommendations on the management of persistent H. pylori infection following multiple eradication attempts are lacking. While biomarkers for precancerous changes are under investigation, none can currently be recommended for routine clinical use. The IHPWG consensus recommends endoscopic surveillance with the European Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy/ management of epithelial precancerous conditions and lesions in the stomach mapping biopsies for precancerous changes at an interval of 5–10 years from the last failed H. pylori eradication attempt to monitor for signs of mucosal progression. In addition, the development of new symptoms at any stage during follow-up, especially any alarm symptoms, should trigger further assessment. Finally, the persistence of H. pylori infection should be considered as a relevant factor by any clinician prescribing nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or long-term PPIs.

Statement 14: as part of a quality assurance programme, Helicobacter pylori first-line, second-line and rescue therapy eradication rates should be locally monitored and audited as part of national and European registries

Recommendation: strong; quality of evidence: moderate.

There are geographical variations in the prevalence of H. pylori antimicrobial resistance and resistance is a continuously evolving process. Therefore, resistance surveillance is recommended (see statement 6). Currently, there is no national program for longterm resistance surveillance in Ireland. Monitoring the eradication success to the various treatment regimens prescribed offers an additional and more widely accessible approach to select the most appropriate H. pylori therapies in each population. The IHPWG consensus is that practitioners should perform regular audits of H. pylori treatment outcomes and that the data should be shared by means of a national registry, as well as with the Hp-EuReg, to refine the best-practice recommendations for the management of H. pylori infection in Ireland over time.

### Treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection. indications and regimens: an update [^111njafG]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2002). Low credibility.

The management of Helicobacter pylori infection is still surrounded by controversy and uncertainties. Indications and correct application of current regimens for Helicobacter pylori infection are still considered a matter of debate. Regarding indications, only peptic ulcer and mucosa associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma are considered clear indications for treatment. In other conditions, such as atrophic gastritis, post gastric cancer resection, first-degree relatives of gastric cancer patients, dyspeptic patients, patients with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug users, the value of Helicobacter pylori eradication is still controversial. The regimens for first-line and second-line treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection have been recommended by the Maastricht 2 Consensus Report. Although all the treatments are considered to be effective, physicians still do not agree on what first-line regimen should be used. Furthermore, a consensus on the duration of the antibiotic treatment is still lacking, although Maastricht guidelines for treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection recommend a one-week therapy. Also regimens, as a third-line treatment, and methods to improve compliance and clinical outcome are still a matter of debate. All these points will be considered in the present review

### How to effectively use bismuth quadruple therapy: the good, the bad, and the ugly [^11567qye]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Bismuth triple therapy was the first effective Helicobacter pylori eradication therapy. The addition of a proton pump inhibitor helped overcome metronidazole resistance. Its primary indication is penicillin allergy or when clarithromycin and metronidazole resistance are both common. Resistance to the primary first-line therapy have centered on complexity and difficulties with compliance. Understanding regional differences in effectiveness remains unexplained because of the lack of studies including susceptibility testing and adherence data. We discuss regimen variations including substitutions of doxycycline, amoxicillin, and twice a day therapy and provide suggestions regarding what is needed to rationally and effectively use bismuth quadruple therapy.

UBT and FAT strategies

These two strategies follow an identical management pathway. The first step is testing for H. pylori with one of the two methods. If the pathogen is detected, first-line antibiotic therapy with clarithromycin-based triple therapy is initiated to eradicate it (according to the reference guide published by Public Health England). If a switch to other first-line therapies would become necessary (ie, clarithromycin resistance > 15%), costs of therapy will remain similar. At the end of the prescribed treatment course, the patient is retested by UBT or FAT. In case of persistence of the infection, a second-line eradication treatment is initiated and the patient then tested again. Therapeutic outcomes are modelled after first-line therapy in the case of successful eradication or after second-line therapy regardless of whether eradication had been achieved.

In the case of a negative H. pylori test, symptomatic treatment, including mainly a proton pump inhibitor (PPI), is initiated for 4 weeks, and therapeutic outcome is evaluated at the end of this period. If symptoms have been relieved, the treatment is considered successful. If not, the patient undergoes endoscopy to identify any potential lesion (peptic ulcer or other macroscopic pathology).

Endoscopy-based strategy

In this strategy, the first step is to perform an endoscopy to detect any lesion and to take biopsies for H. pylori assay. If the assay result is negative, a 4-week symptomatic treatment is initiated after which outcome (symptom relief) is evaluated. If the result is positive, the patient undergoes first-line, and, if a retest is again positive, second-line, antibiotic treatment to eradicate the pathogen. As in the UBT and FAT strategies, therapeutic outcomes are modelled after first-line therapy in the case of successful eradication or after second-line therapy regardless of whether eradication had been achieved.

Empirical symptomatic treatment strategy

In this strategy, the first step is to start empirical symptomatic treatment with a PPI for 4 weeks. If symptoms have been relieved, the treatment is considered successful. If not, the patient undergoes endoscopy and follows the endoscopy strategy described above.

### Implications of the paradigm shift in management ofinfections [^117VLx6z]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

The recent availability of susceptibility testing for Helicobacter pylori infections in the United Sates has resulted in paradigm shifts in the diagnosis, therapy, and follow-up of H. pylori infections. Here, we reviewed the English literature concerning changes in H. pylori diagnosis and therapy with an emphasis on the last 3years. We focus on the new methods that offer rapid and convenient susceptibility testing using either invasive (endoscopic) or noninvasive (stool) methods of obtaining test material. We also discuss the implications of this availability on therapy and follow-up after therapy. The approach to therapy was categorized into four groups: (1) therapies that can be used empirically, (2) therapies that should be restricted to those that are susceptibility-based, (3) potentially effective therapies that have yet to be optimized for local use, and (4), therapies that contain unneeded antibiotics that should not be prescribed. The most convenient and efficient method of susceptibility testing is by using reflexive stool testing in which if the sample is positive, it is automatically also used for determination of susceptibility. Reflexive testing can also be done via reflexive ordering (e.g., for all positive urea breath tests). The post therapy test-of-cure has emerged as a critical component of therapy as it not only provides feedback regarding treatment success but when combined with susceptibility testing also provide evidence regarding the cause of failure (e.g., poor adherence versus emergence of resistance during therapy. Susceptibility testing has made even the most current H. pylori guidelines for diagnosis and therapy generally obsolete. Clarithromycin, metronidazole, and levofloxacin triple therapies should only be administered as susceptibility-based therapy. Regimens containing unneeded antibiotics should not be given. We provide recommendations regarding the details and indications for all current therapies.

### First-and second-lineeradication with modified sequential therapy and modified levofloxacin-amoxicillin-based triple therapy [^113RYXao]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Patients and methods

This was a prospective, open label, pilot study conducted in 4 Endoscopy Units, considering patients referred for upper endoscopy due to dyspeptic symptoms between June and December 2013. For the first-line therapy, consecutive adult H. pylori -positive patients never treated before were recruited. All patients underwent upper GI endoscopy, and gastric biopsies were obtained both from the antrum (2 specimens) and the corpus (2 specimens) for histological assessment and H. pylori detection. The infection was diagnosed when H. pylori bacteria with concomitant chronic active gastritis were recognized at histological examination. For the purpose of the study, only those patients without endoscopic lesions, i.e. non-ulcer dyspepsia patients, were enrolled to achieve homogenous sampling. Patients with relevant comorbidities (liver, kidney, or heart failure), and those with a personal history of intolerance or allergy to the study drugs were excluded. All patients received a modified 10-day sequential therapy regimen including rabeprazole 20 mg, and amoxicillin 1 g, all thrice daily, for the first 3 days, and rabeprazole 20 mg, clarithromycin 250 mg, and metronidazole 250 mg, all thrice daily, for the remaining 7 days. Rabeprazole was given 30 min before breakfast, lunch and dinner, whilst antibiotics followed these meals. Only brand drugs were prescribed. To favor compliance, patients were carefully instructed to adhere to the drug regimen, and were advised of the possible side effects. Compliance and incidence of side effects were evaluated, in addition to self-reporting, by direct interview at the end of therapy. A good compliance was defined as > 90% of prescribed drugs. Eradication was assessed 4 to 6 weeks after the end of the therapy, performing a standard 13 C-Urea Breath Test (UBT), according to the manufacturer's recommendations.

For the second-line therapy, patients who failed this modified sequential therapy, as well as those with persistent infection following a standard triple therapy observed in the same study period were invited to participate. All received an 8-day therapy regimen with rabeprazole 20 mg, levofloxacin 250 mg, and amoxicillin 1 g, all thrice daily. H. pylori cure was checked by a further UBT performed 4–6 weeks after the end of the therapy. All patients provided informed consent.

### ACG clinical guideline: treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection [^1152BnKX]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Helicobacter pylori antibiotic susceptibility testing — first-line and salvage therapy evidence and expert guidance are as follows: Meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials for first-line therapy showed a small advantage for tailored therapy (risk ratio 1.15; 95% CI 1.11–1.20 and 1.14; 95% CI 1.08–1.21). When empiric therapy was BQT or nonbismuth quadruple, no advantage was seen; accordingly, when BQT is chosen and local eradication rate is ≥ 85%, there is no need for susceptibility testing before first-line treatment, and providers are encouraged to monitor success rates and consider using antibiotic susceptibility testing if eradication rates with their preferred first-line therapies are less than 85%. In treatment-experienced patients, meta-analyses concluded testing before second- or third-line therapy did not improve eradication outcomes; the evidence base was limited (for second-line therapy, only 5 relevant studies with approximately 200 patients in each arm; for third-line therapy, only 3 studies, and in the only large RCT with approximately 200 patients per arm, tailored therapy had a 6% advantage that was not statistically significant). In a third-line comparison of molecular vs culture-based testing, tailored regimens were similar and both were superior to historic empiric controls (88% vs 78%). Based on expert consensus language, "we advise using antibiotic susceptibility testing when the choice of therapy remains unclear after taking into consideration previous treatments for H. pylori infection, past antibiotic exposure more generally (particularly use of macrolides and quinolones), and any documented history of penicillin allergy", and "we recommend antibiotic susceptibility testing before the use of regimens containing clarithromycin or levofloxacin".

### Efficacy of Helicobacter pylori eradication in uninvestigated chronic dyspeptic staff members of a large factory: a prospective, long-term, follow-up, workplace outcome study [^115ioyuA]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Current European guidelines propose Helicobacter pylori eradication for the initial management of patients under 45 years with uninvestigated dyspepsia without alarm symptoms. Until now, no study has assessed this strategy in occupational medicine.

Aim

To investigate the outcome of H. pylori eradication in staff members of a large factory with uninvestigated chronic dyspepsia in a prospective, open, controlled, workplace outcome study in terms of the 1 year follow-up of dyspepsia and quality of life.

Methods

In 267 subjects with uninvestigated chronic dyspepsia (229 males, mean age 42 years; range 22–62 years) H. pylori status was assessed by using the 13C-urea breath test at baseline. H. pylori-positive subjects were offered 1 week eradication therapy with omeprazole 20 mg b.i.d., clarithromycin 250 mg b.i.d., and metronidazole 400 mg b.i.d., and were retested after 2 months. Subjects with a negative 13C-urea breath test at 2 months were H. pylori-responders; subjects still H. pylori-positive at this time were H. pylori-nonresponders. H. pylori-negative subjects at baseline were included as a reference. Dyspeptic symptoms, quality of life and health care utilization were assessed by questionnaires at baseline (T0), and at 2 (T2) and 12 months (T12).

Results

One hundred and eleven of 267 (41.65%) subjects were H. pylori-positive at baseline. The infection was cured in 85 of 94 (90.4%) subjects. Upper abdominal pain and dyspeptic symptoms were significantly reduced and quality of life significantly increased in H. pylori responder subjects at T12 compared to baseline and to reference subjects (P < 0.01). At T12 42.3% of H. pylori responder subjects showed complete relief of epigastric pain compared to 9.2% in the reference group (P < 0.001). Furthermore, disease-related absence from work, visits to family physicians, and antacid consumption significantly decreased in H. pylori responder subjects compared with reference subjects (P < 0.05).

Conclusion

These data suggest that an H. pylori test-and-treat strategy in occupational medicine is effective for improving uninvestigated dyspepsia and quality of life and it may reduce dyspepsia related health care costs at a level of occupational medicine.

### AGA clinical practice update on the management of refractory Helicobacter pylori infection: expert review [^116dWfT8]. Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Considerations in regimen selection for refractory H. pylori

There is no shortage of guidelines from international authorities advising on H. pylori management. Some of the most prominent recent releases are listed in Table 1.–

Overall, the guidance for the management of refractory infection are relatively consistent among the expert groups. However, it should be emphasized that the body of evidence underlying their conclusions reflects the general low quality and heterogeneity of clinical studies conducted on refractory H. pylori infection. Furthermore, most of the trials included in metanalyses of second-line treatment have investigated treatment after failure of a first-line regimen with clarithromycin-based triple therapy, a regimen that we now appreciate should no longer be used in most regions of the world, including the US. Lastly, even though incorporation of antibiotic susceptibility testing has been advocated by the Maastricht expert consensus group since the first iteration of their guidelines in 1997, the slow uptake of resistance testing around the world persists and continues to propagate empiric selection of eradication therapy for most refractory H. pylori infections, especially in the US.

Nevertheless, several important themes have emerged for guiding treatment of refractory H. pylori infection. First, given the high resistance rates to clarithromycin and levofloxacin, these antibiotics or others in their class (macrolides, fluoroquinolones respectively) should not be repeated in subsequent treatment attempts. Based on the premise that secondary H. pylori resistance may have ensued as collateral damage, an antibiotic history of usage of any of these drug classes for other indications should be considered when selecting subsequent therapy. Because primary and secondary resistance to amoxicillin, tetracycline, and rifabutin are very low, these can be used in repeated regimens, even if they have been used previously for H. pylori eradication or other therapy.(BPA #2) Age, comorbidities, and concomitant medications should also guide therapeutic selection and factor into shared decision-making.

### Vonoprazan, a novel potassium-competitive acid blocker, as a component of first-line and second-line triple therapy for Helicobacter pylori eradication: a phase III, randomised, double-blind study [^1157g23i]. Gut (2016). Low credibility.

Methods

Study design

This was a phase III, randomised, double-blind, multicentre, parallel-group comparative study designed to verify the non-inferiority of vonoprazan/AMX/CLR (hereafter vonoprazan-based first-line triple therapy) to lansoprazole/AMX/CLR (hereafter lansoprazole-based first-line triple therapy) as first-line triple-therapy for H pylori- positive patients with gastric or duodenal ulcer history. Both first-line triple therapies were evaluated for safety, and second-line triple therapy with vonoprazan/AMX/MTZ (hereafter vonoprazan-based second-line triple therapy) as an open-label treatment was evaluated for efficacy and safety in the first 50 subjects who failed their allocated vonoprazan-based or lansoprazole-based first-line triple therapy.

The study was conducted at 46 sites in Japan between February 2012 and June 2013 in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, the ICH Harmonized Tripartite Guideline for Good Clinical Practice and all Japanese regulatory requirements and was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov with the identifier NCT01505127. The protocol was approved by the institutional review board at each study site.

Subjects

Male or female H pylori -positive patients aged ≥ 20 years with gastric or duodenal ulcer history were eligible for inclusion in the study. The presence of H pylori was confirmed by one or more of the following methodologies before treatment: the rapid urease test, culture, the 13 C-urea breath test and/or the stool H pylori antigen test. The main exclusion criteria included acute upper GI bleeding, active gastric or duodenal ulcers, acute gastric or duodenal mucosal lesions, previous H pylori eradication therapy, surgery which might affect gastric acid secretion (upper GI resection or vagotomy), Zollinger–Ellison syndrome or other gastric acid hypersecretion disorders, serious neurological, cardiovascular, pulmonary, hepatic, renal, metabolic, GI, urological, endocrinological or haematological disorders, need for surgery, history of drug (including alcohol) abuse, history of malignancy and female subjects who were pregnant or lactating. Any sexually active female of childbearing potential was required to use adequate contraceptive measures. All subjects provided written informed consent prior to study participation.
