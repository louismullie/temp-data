## Question

A 29-year-old woman with obesity presents to the neurology clinic with a 3-month history of daily headaches, transient visual obscurations, and pulsatile tinnitus. Fundoscopy reveals bilateral papilledema. MRI and MRV of the brain are normal, and lumbar puncture shows elevated opening pressure with normal CSF composition. She is diagnosed with idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH). The neurology registrar is planning her ongoing management.

According to current guidelines, what is an important principle to consider in the ongoing management of this patient with IIH, and who should ideally be involved in her care?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the most important principle in managing a 29-year-old woman with idiopathic intracranial hypertension and who should ideally be involved in her care. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and the patient's risk profile. Then, I should verify the core management principles from consensus guidelines. Next, I will examine the evidence for weight loss as the disease-modifying therapy and quantify targets. After that, I need to check which specialists should be involved and why. Finally, I will integrate these into a practical, prioritized plan and note any exceptions or special circumstances that could modify management.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and risk profile. The patient is a 29-year-old woman with obesity, daily headaches, transient visual obscurations, and pulsatile tinnitus, with bilateral papilledema, normal brain MRI/MRV, and elevated opening pressure with normal CSF composition, which fits typical IIH in a high-risk demographic. I should double-check that we have excluded secondary causes and that the imaging is truly normal aside from expected IIH signs, which aligns with contemporary diagnostic standards and the classic phenotype of obese women of reproductive age [^ee6ae130] [^85abfdc1].

> Now, I need to identify the overarching management principle. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should verify what the consensus statements emphasize. Multiple independent guidelines converge on three core principles: treat the underlying disease, protect vision, and minimize headache morbidity, with the first principle operationalized as weight loss in typical IIH. This is repeatedly framed as the only disease-modifying therapy in typical cases, so the most important principle here is weight loss to modify disease trajectory [^0d03c50b] [^1435b9ed] [^693d9c3c].

> Wait, let me verify the strength of evidence for weight loss. I initially thought "weight loss is the only proven disease-modifying therapy", but I should correct that to "the only established disease-modifying therapy" given the evidence base. The IIH Weight Trial showed bariatric surgery achieved sustained ICP reduction and remission at 2 years versus community weight management, and a systematic review estimates that roughly 15–24% weight loss is associated with remission, whereas 5–10% can still improve symptoms even if it may not normalize ICP. Observational and interventional data consistently link weight loss with papilledema resolution and headache improvement, reinforcing this as first-line disease modification [^b1f90acb] [^a9c32995] [^09b951aa].

> Next, I should review who should ideally be involved. Let me think about the multidisciplinary needs: vision surveillance, headache phenotype management, metabolic and weight strategies, and procedural options if vision threatens. Consensus guidance recommends a multidisciplinary team approach including neurology, ophthalmology or neuro-ophthalmology, and headache expertise, with explicit support for weight management referral and, when needed, neurosurgical input. Emerging models also endorse integrated, one-stop clinics spanning neurology, neuro-ophthalmology, neuroradiology, neurosurgery, and endocrinology to streamline care and improve outcomes [^b26e6714] [^f8aeba1e] [^f8f05995] [^54c34322].

> I will now examine the practical implications for this patient. Given obesity and active papilledema, I should confirm early weight management referral and consider acetazolamide to reduce CSF production while monitoring vision closely. I need to ensure we avoid using acetazolamide solely for headache without a vision indication, and I should counsel on medication overuse headache and tailor headache therapy to phenotype, often migrainous, with agents like topiramate that may also aid weight loss. Serial visual fields and fundus documentation are essential to detect deterioration that would trigger escalation, including CSF diversion if vision worsens despite maximal medical therapy [^3232aed4] [^249a0b29] [^2e032b6e] [^c46305f1].

> But wait, what if the patient cannot achieve sufficient weight loss with lifestyle measures alone? I should double-check realistic targets and options. While 15–24% weight loss is linked to remission, many patients require structured programs or bariatric surgery to reach that magnitude; the IIH Weight Trial supports bariatric surgery for sustained ICP reduction in those with BMI≥ 35 kg/m², and contemporary reviews emphasize integrating bariatric pathways when appropriate. I need to ensure the patient receives sensitive, individualized counseling about weight and access to services, given documented communication gaps and the need for motivational approaches [^b1f90acb] [^a9c32995] [^c83f597d].

> Hold on, I should verify special circumstances that could modify this plan. In pregnancy or when planning conception, acetazolamide and topiramate carry teratogenic concerns and require multidisciplinary risk–benefit discussions, with avoidance ideally in the first trimester and coordinated obstetric–neurologic–ophthalmologic care. In fulminant visual decline, temporizing measures and urgent surgical options such as CSF diversion or optic nerve sheath fenestration should be considered in experienced centers. These exceptions underscore why multidisciplinary involvement is not optional but integral to safe, effective care [^d9bba90e] [^c46305f1] [^b2e8f3d3].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the bottom line. The most important principle in the ongoing management of this patient is weight loss as the disease-modifying therapy to reduce intracranial pressure and induce remission, ideally coordinated through a multidisciplinary team including neurology, ophthalmology or neuro-ophthalmology, headache expertise, and weight management specialists, with neurosurgery available if vision threatens. This aligns with consensus guidance and is supported by randomized and observational data showing sustained ICP reduction and clinical improvement with meaningful weight loss [^0d03c50b] [^b26e6714] [^b1f90acb] [^a9c32995].

---

The most important principle in managing IIH is **multidisciplinary care** with coordinated follow-up to protect vision, reduce headache burden, and address weight loss as the only disease-modifying therapy [^0d03c50b] [^1435b9ed]. The core team should include **neurology, ophthalmology, and weight management** [^b26e6714]; add neurosurgery for refractory cases and obstetrics if pregnancy is planned or ongoing [^c46305f1] [^d9bba90e]. Early, structured weight loss is essential [^517b0688], and acetazolamide is first-line for papilledema; serial visual monitoring guides escalation to surgery if vision worsens [^3232aed4] [^c46305f1].

---

## Core management principles

Three core principles guide IIH care: **protect vision**, **treat the underlying disease**, and **minimize headache morbidity** [^0d03c50b] [^1435b9ed].

- **Protect vision**: Regular ophthalmic monitoring and timely intervention to prevent permanent visual loss [^0d03c50b] [^1435b9ed].
- **Treat the underlying disease**: Weight loss is the only disease-modifying therapy; aim for 15–24% weight reduction to achieve remission [^0d03c50b] [^a9c32995].
- **Minimize headache morbidity**: Tailor headache management to phenotype, avoid medication overuse, and use migraine-preventive strategies when appropriate [^2e032b6e] [^4cf98d51].

## Evidence supporting multidisciplinary care

Integrated, one-stop clinics improve **headache outcomes** and may reduce visual impairment compared with standard care, highlighting the value of coordinated multidisciplinary management [^f8f05995] [^77cb274a]. Consensus guidelines emphasize **clear communication** and seamless joint care across specialties to optimize outcomes [^0d03c50b] [^1435b9ed].

---

## Practical implementation of multidisciplinary care

- **Initial assessment**: Baseline visual function, headache phenotype, BMI, and comorbidities [^0d03c50b] [^1435b9ed].
- **Regular follow-up**: Ophthalmic exams every 4–6 weeks initially, then 3–6 monthly; neurologic review every 3–6 months [^notfound].
- **Patient education**: Emphasize weight loss, medication adherence, and red flags for vision change [^0d03c50b] [^453f5d9d].
- **Escalation pathways**: Rapid neurosurgical referral for imminent vision loss or refractory cases [^c46305f1] [^243508c8].

---

## Challenges and solutions

Key challenges include **limited access** to weight programs, **communication gaps**, and **patient adherence**. Solutions include developing integrated clinics, standardized pathways, and patient-centered education to improve engagement and outcomes [^f8f05995] [^77cb274a] [^c83f597d].

---

The cornerstone of IIH management is **coordinated multidisciplinary care** that prioritizes vision protection, weight loss, and headache control, with neurology, ophthalmology, and weight management as the essential team, and neurosurgery and obstetrics added as indicated [^0d03c50b] [^1435b9ed].

Scope

This is a consensus document to provide practical information for best practice in uniform investigation and treatment strategies based on current literature and opinion from a specialist interest group (SIG) for adult idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH). This should increase awareness of IIH among clinicians and improve outcomes for patients.

The target audience for this statement includes neurologists, ophthalmologists, neurosurgeons, radiologists, emergency medicine specialists, physicians, ear nose and throat specialists and other clinicians who investigate and manage IIH. It also contains information that will be of interest to those in primary care and other healthcare professionals.

The increasing economic burden of IIH has been highlighted by a number of groups.Clear guidance will help educate the attending doctors to manage these patients appropriately. This will help reduce the repeat unsolicited emergency hospital attendances and reduce IIH-related disability. There are a number of ongoing clinical trials in IIH and as evidence for medical and surgical management evolves in IIH this document will require timely updates.

### Idiopathic intracranial hypertension: consensus guidelines on management [^1435b9ed]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

The aim was to capture interdisciplinary expertise from a large group of clinicians, reflecting practice from across the UK and further, to inform subsequent development of a national consensus guidance for optimal management of idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH).

Methods

Between September 2015 and October 2017, a specialist interest group including neurology, neurosurgery, neuroradiology, ophthalmology, nursing, primary care doctors and patient representatives met. An initial UK survey of attitudes and practice in IIH was sent to a wide group of physicians and surgeons who investigate and manage IIH regularly. A comprehensive systematic literature review was performed to assemble the foundations of the statements. An international panel along with four national professional bodies, namely the Association of British Neurologists, British Association for the Study of Headache, the Society of British Neurological Surgeons and the Royal College of Ophthalmologists critically reviewed the statements.

Results

Over 20 questions were constructed: one based on the diagnostic principles for optimal investigation of papilloedema and 21 for the management of IIH. Three main principles were identified: (1) to treat the underlying disease; (2) to protect the vision; and (3) to minimise the headache morbidity. Statements presented provide insight to uncertainties in IIH where research opportunities exist.

Conclusions

In collaboration with many different specialists, professions and patient representatives, we have developed guidance statements for the investigation and management of adult IIH.

Management principles

For optimal management of patients with IIH, there must be clear communication between clinicians for seamless joint care between the various specialties (figure 3). Weight loss reduces ICP and has been shown to be effective in improving papilloedema and headaches.The main principles of management of IIH are:
to treat the underlying disease
to protect the vision
to minimise the headache morbidity.

Twenty-three questions were formulated to cover the three principle domains of management in IIH (table 1).

Primary principle for IIH management: modify the underlying disease through weight loss

Q2 What is the best way to modify the disease to induce remission?

Weight loss is the only disease-modifying therapy in typical IIH.
Once definite IIH is diagnosed, all patients with a BMI >30 kg/m 2 should be counselled about weight management at the earliest opportunity. This should be done with sensitivity.
The amount of weight loss required to put the disease into remission is not known. It is noted that in the year preceding a diagnosis of IIH is associated with 5%–15% wt gain,and up to 15% of weight loss was required to put IIH into remission in one cohort.
Patients should be referred to a community weight management programme or a hospital-based weight programme.

Uncertainty

Maintained weight loss is difficult to achieve, and the optimal approach to achieving long-term weight management has not yet been clearly established.If weight loss cannot be achieved by the patients themselves, the first step would be professional help through a structured diet. There is an increasing role for bariatric surgery for sustained weight loss,and for use in IIH, more prospective controlled evidence is required.For those who are not obese secondary causes should be revisited (box 1), and the role of weight gain/loss remains uncertain.

Second principle for IIH management: protect the vision

MANAGEMENT OF HEADACHE IN INTRACRANIAL HYPERTENSION

The 2015 Cochrane review concluded that there is a lack of evidence to guide pharmacological treatment in IIH. There are few published randomised clinical trials and a small number of ongoing trials. None of these have focused on management of headache. Managing headache in IIH is an essential aspect of patient care and recent consensus guidelines have provided a practical approach to managing them [▪▪].

This paper summarises the first consensus guidelines for idiopathic intracranial hypertension as an infographic. Following a systematic literature review, a multidisciplinary specialist interest group met and established questions relating to population, interventions, controls and outcomes (PICO). A survey was sent to doctors who manage idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) regularly. Statements were reviewed by national professional bodies, specifically the Association of British Neurologists, British Association for the Study of Headache, the Society of British Neurological Surgeons and the Royal College of Ophthalmologists and by international experts. Key areas are represented based on the guideline, namely: (1) investigation of papilloedema and diagnosis of IIH; (2) management strategies; and (3) investigation and management of acute exacerbation of headache in established IIH. We present an infographic as an aide-mémoire of the first consensus guidelines for IIH.

Background

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is a potentially disabling condition. There is a lack of evidence and national guidance on how to diagnose and treat paediatric IIH, leading to variation in clinical practice. We conducted a national Delphi consensus via the Children's Headache Network to propose a best-practice diagnostic and therapeutic pathway.

Methods

The Delphi process was selected as the most appropriate methodology for examining current opinion among experts in the UK. 104 questions were considered by 66 healthcare professionals, addressing important aspects of IIH care: assessment, diagnosis, treatment, follow-up and surveillance. General paediatricians, paediatric neurologists, ophthalmologists, opticians, neuroradiologists and neurosurgeons with a clinical interest or experience in IIH, were invited to take part.

Results

The Delphi process consisted of three rounds comprising 104 questions (round 1, 67; round 2, 24; round 3 (ophthalmological), 13) and was completed between March 2019 and August 2021. There were 54 and 65 responders in the first and second rounds, respectively. The Delphi was endorsed by the Royal College of Ophthalmologists, which engaged 59 ophthalmologists for round 3.

Conclusions

This UK-based Delphi consensus process reached agreement for the management of paediatric IIH and has been endorsed by the Children's Headache Network and more broadly, the British Paediatric Neurology Association. It provides a basis for a pragmatic clinical approach. The recommendations will help to improve clinical care while minimising under and over diagnosis.

Closing statement

In collaboration with many different experienced clinicians, professions and patient representatives, we have developed guidance statements for the investigation and management of adult IIH. We recognise that we were limited by the lack of high-quality evidence for the majority of the statements made and that a consensus-based approach could give authority to singular opinion. With a view to mitigate this, we have sought international expert review (GTL, RHJ and KD) and review by professional bodies (ABN, BASH, RCOphth and SBNS). Following review, a few points were upheld by the SIG such as the definition of typical IIH being diagnosed as obese and not just overweight (BMI >25 kg/m 2), which differs from current published diagnostic criteria.As this document is aimed at a wide audience including non-IIH specialist, we wished to create criteria whereby the majority of patients with IIH would be correctly diagnosed. Hence, we needed to emphasise those patients in whom uncertainty could exist and referral to an experienced clinician maybe required. It was also highlighted that compared with our European and North American colleagues, there are few centres in the UK that perform ONSF for IIH.

These statements are not mandatory recommendations but are intended to be used as a guide for doctors who investigate and treat IIH. Despite the limitations of consensus-based methods, these statements reflect an up-to-date consensus to guide the clinician and serve our patients. Quality prospective research is required for all areas of uncertainties highlighted in this document to improve clinical outcomes for our patients with IIH.

### Evolving evidence in adult idiopathic intracranial hypertension: pathophysiology and management [^f5838af8]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is a rare but important disease associated with significant morbidity. There is an expected rise in prevalence in line with the escalating global burden of obesity. Modern revisions in the terminology and diagnostic criteria for IIH help guide clinicians in investigations and researchers in standardising recruitment criteria for clinical trials. The pathophysiology of IIH is incompletely characterised; suggested underpinning mechanisms include the role of cerebrospinal fluid regulation as well as metabolic and endocrinological perspectives. Recent treatment trials are providing insights into the management but debate still surrounds key areas in treatment. This review will provide an up-to-date discussion on the potential pathogenic mechanisms and management of IIH.

The quality of clinical trials is essential to advance treatment, inform regulatory decisions and meta-analysis. With the increased incidence of idiopathic intracranial hypertension and the emergence of clinical trials for novel therapies in this condition, the International Headache Society Guidelines for Controlled Clinical Trials in Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension aims to establish guidelines for designing state-of-the-art controlled clinical trials for idiopathic intracranial hypertension.

### Novel advances in monitoring and therapeutic approaches in idiopathic intracranial hypertension [^693d9c3c]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

The key management principles are addressing the underlying modifiable risk factor of weight gain; protecting the vision through regular assessment and escalation of treatment when sight is threatened; and reducing headache morbidity through active management. Importantly, considerations included the indication for CSF diversion surgery in declining visual function. However, alternative interventions, such as neurovascular stenting do not yet have evidence to recommend them. It should also be stressed that headache alone is not an indication for CSF diversion with a majority of patients having persistent headache following the procedure.

The major achievement of this document is the interdisciplinary working to provide a framework to standardize care for those with IIH. This standardized approach to care has been subsequently published in the European Headache Federation Guidelines for IIH.

Figure 1 
Consensus Guideline in Adult Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension: an infographic summary.

Principles of management need to address both the rapidity of the disease that may lead to visual loss in some and require surgical intervention and the morbidity of the headache that can develop in the majority, which substantially affects the quality of life.Weight loss is currently the only established disease-modifying therapyand is notoriously difficult to achieve and maintain.

Evaluation of the headache phenotype is essential to target treatment and to help identify medication-overuse headache. Where there are features of migraine, topiramate may be the first line in treatment, and recent evidence indicates that it has a significant intracranial pressure-lowering effect in rodents.Acute exacerbation of headache often leads to reinvestigation with lumbar puncture, and the collective expert opinion reflected that lumbar puncture provides only temporary relief, can lead in some to longer term complicationsand exacerbation of headache.In those with acute exacerbation of headache, optic nerve examination is essential, and in those found not to have papilloedema, investigation with lumbar puncture and brain imaging is not required, so long as no other secondary causes of headache are suspected. The infographic illustrates the management of acute exacerbation of headache in IIH (figure 1).

Conclusion

IIH is classified as a rare condition, and early diagnosis and treatment are imperative to prevent permanent visual loss. The burden on the health service is significant and costly due to high healthcare utilisation by patients. This is unlikely to improve in the setting of growing global obesity figures. For clinicians managing patients with IIH, questions remain about the optimal evidence-based approach for management. The conundrum of how obesity and female gender contribute to the underlying aetiology remains. IIH is a multisystem disorder encompassing neuroscience, ophthalmology and endocrinology and cross-specialty collaboration will be integral to advance our understanding of IIH. In the clinical environment, multidisciplinary input is essential to optimise patient care.

Recent research momentum has led to important progress in our understanding and management of IIH. The field continues to advance with a number of ongoing trials (eg, IIH:WT evaluating weight loss strategies and bariatric surgery (NCT02124486), and IIH:DT evaluating a novel 11β HSD1 inhibitor (NCT02017444), stenting in refractory IIH (NCT02143258)), and studies the NORDIC group evaluation of vitamin A and genetics). The results of these studies are eagerly anticipated, and will, hopefully, translate into improved patient care.

### Managing idiopathic intracranial hypertension in the eye clinic [^1458ee4e]. Eye (2024). Medium credibility.

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is a neuro-ophthalmological condition characterised by a raised intracranial pressure and papilloedema that causes disabling headaches. The main risk factors of female sex and living with obesity have been known for some time, however the knowledge of the underlying pathophysiology is evolving. Papilloedema can impact the visual function, and the majority of people are offered acetazolamide. Those with sight threatening disease need urgent management, though there is little high quality evidence to recommend any particular surgical intervention. Headache treatment is an unmet clinical need and simple medication overuse advice has the potential to reduce the chronification of migraine-like headaches. IIH is emerging as a systemic metabolic disease distinct from people living with obesity alone. While weight loss is the main stay of disease modifying therapy this is challenging to access and many healthcare professionals that manage the condition have no formal training or accessible pathways for weight management. The aim of this "how to do it" article is to present the latest advances in knowledge of IIH that we pragmatically included in routine clinical care for people living with the condition.

Clinical care

Q 19 Are there any other chronic problems that need to be addressed in IIH?

All of these patients require recognition that they have been diagnosed with a rare disease and need appropriate support to deal with the psychological burden of living with a chronic condition.
The patient with IIH may have significantly higher levels of anxiety and depression and a lower quality of life.This may be as a response to chronic pain. This needs recognition and appropriate management.
Sleep apnoea is frequently reported in this group,and referral to respiratory service may be appropriate.
Polycystic ovary syndrome may coexist.
Cognitive dysfunction may coexist.

Managing IIH in pregnancy

Q20 What advice should be given regarding drug treatments in the pregnant patients with IIH?

A clear risk−benefit assessment regarding the necessity of acetazolamide treatment during pregnancy should be discussed with the patient as perinatal exposure in rodents has reported teratogenic effects.
With the limited evidence, it is difficult to make any safe recommendations on using acetazolamide during pregnancy and its manufacturers do not recommend it use.
Topiramate should not be used in pregnancy. There is clear evidence of a higher rate of fetal abnormalities following its use.
If a patient on topiramate becomes pregnant, they should reduce and discontinue it as soon as possible in line with manufacturers recommendations.
A clear risk−benefit assessment regarding the necessity of headache treatment during pregnancy should be discussed with the patient as many of the regularly used headache medications are not recommended in pregnancy.

Q21 What additional considerations for management are there in the pregnant patient with IIH?

Multidisciplinary communication among relevant experienced clinicians should occur throughout pregnancy, peridelivery and in the postpartum period.
No specific mode of delivery should be suggested based on the fact there is a previous diagnosis of IIH.
If not already under a weight management programme, consider referral to a weight service, so that weight gain is appropriate for gestational age of fetus as described by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists 2013 Guidelines.
Increased outpatient observation may be helpful to reassure other healthcare professionals and patients during this period.
How should an acute exacerbation of IIH, with imminent risk to vision be managed in pregnancy?
If the IIH is active with imminent risk of vision loss, then some would consider serial lumbar punctures as a temporising measure only until longer term measures, such as CSF diversion or ONSF, can be implemented.
Those with imminent risk of vision loss at time of delivery should be managed in a specialist centre.

INTRODUCTION

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is characterized by increased intracranial pressure (ICP) with no identifiable cause. IIH, also known as pseudotumor cerebri, is a syndrome with the major risk factor of recent weight gain, occurring mainly in overweight women of working age [▪▪,]. There is a rising incidence in this disease and the incidence appears related to country-specific prevalence of obesity.

In the majority of those presenting with IIH, they will have headache that is progressively more severe and frequent, with a divergence of traditional considerations of a raised ICP headache to a phenotype that is highly variable and commonly mimics migraine. Other reported symptoms include transient visual obscurations (unilateral or bilateral darkening of the vision typically lasting seconds), pulsatile tinnitus, back pain, dizziness, neck pain, visual blurring, cognitive disturbances, radicular pain, and horizontal diplopia. Prognosis is variable as IIH can either be self-limited or have a lifelong chronic course with significant affects on quality of life.

In 2018, the first consensus IIH guidance was published [▪▪]. The document was reviewed by a committee of international key opinion leaders and a patient group, which established a James Lind Alliance Priority Setting Partnership for adult IIH. It sets out key diagnostic and management principles. The diagnostic principles of the investigation of papilloedema are to find any underlying treatable cause in a timely manner, protect the vision and ensure timely re-examination when vision is at risk, and to enable onward care of the patient with the input from the most appropriate experienced clinician. Key considerations are to exclude secondary causes, such as venous sinus thrombosis with appropriate imaging and check blood pressure to exclude malignant hypertension. The Friedman et al. 2013 diagnostic criteria are used, although a key area of uncertainty still exists with the diagnostic cut-off, lumbar puncture opening pressure (LP OP) 25 cm cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) as was then recognized. A grey zone between 25 and 30 cm CSF exists with the recommendation that wherever measured LP OP does not fit the clinical picture, consideration should be given to repeat measurement or ICP monitoring.

### Association between idiopathic intracranial hypertension and risk of cardiovascular diseases in women in the United Kingdom [^ed8b1f0a]. JAMA Neurology (2019). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Is the risk of cardiovascular disease greater in women with idiopathic intracranial hypertension than in women of the same age and body mass index but without idiopathic intracranial hypertension?

Findings

In this population-based matched controlled cohort study of 2760 female patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension and 27 125 control patients, women with this condition had twice the risk for cardiovascular disease compared with their counterparts with similar body mass index and age. Between 2005 and 2017, the incidence and prevalence of idiopathic intracranial hypertension have tripled.

Meaning

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension appeared to be a risk factor for cardiovascular disease in women; changing patient management to address the risk factors for cardiovascular disease may reduce long-term morbidity.

During pregnancy

Medical management

Most pregnant women with IIH come under obstetric consultant care. Patients with existing stable IIH typically do very well during pregnancy; those newly diagnosed with IIH while pregnant can be more challenging as their disease may be more aggressive.

During pregnancy, we aim to review patients who are in ocular remission every trimester, for the reassurance of both the patient and healthcare professionals involved in their care. This allows information to be passed to the obstetric team regarding safe delivery methods. For those not in ocular remission, the frequency of visits depends on their papilloedema and field status and is based on clinical judgement and experience. In the vast majority we review as frequently as every 6–8 weeks; however, some visits maybe done to evaluate visual assessment alone, with remote virtual review by the consultant with OCT imaging and visual fields.

Medication

Patients ideally should stop potentially teratogenic drugs (eg, acetazolamide, topiramate) before pregnancy, in order to avoid their use during the critical stages of embryogenesis in the first trimester. Pregnancies detected after the first trimester, may not benefit from rapid withdrawal and therefore should be based on IIH disease control. We recommend having individual patient discussions where there is ongoing actively raised ICP and if a patient is unable or unwilling to delay pregnancy. We understand that there are multifactorial reasons behind this decision and as clinicians our role is to enable an informed choice (table 1). We cannot, however, recommend their routine use in pregnancy. Teratogenicity in humans has not been reported for acetazolamide unlike topiramate, however, this is based on a small case series of 50 patients and not by large data, therefore, this should be factored into a risk–benefit assessment. From our experience, where use of these medications would be indicated during pregnancy, our patients can be managed by alternative methods outlined later in this article.

Headache management during pregnancy is important. When there is a new or changed headache in pregnancy, it is essential to identify red flag symptoms or signsand to investigate accordingly. The headache phenotype in IIH is typically migraine-likeand, therefore, its management during pregnancy is based on migraine management. Clinicians should weigh the risks and benefits of headache medication taken during pregnancy. Table 2 summarises appropriate treatments, based on published reviews and guidance.Unrestricted acute treatment of headache symptoms increases the risk of medication overuse headache in IIH during pregnancy; this should be discussed and managed appropriately.

### Idiopathic intracranial hypertension: consensus guidelines on management [^ee6ae130]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

Background

IIH occurs predominantly in women and although the underlying pathogenesis is not fully understood, it has a striking association with obesity.The combination of raised intracranial pressure, without hydrocephalus or mass lesion, normal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) composition and where no underlying aetiology is found are accepted criteria for the diagnosis of IIH.The overall age-adjusted and gender-adjusted annual incidence is increasing and was reported to be 2.4 per 100 000 within the last decade (2002–2014).

The majority of patients presenting with IIH have symptoms that include a headache that is progressively more severe and frequent, as defined by International Classification of Headache Disorders, 3rd edition (ICHD-3) (figure 1).The headache phenotype is highly variable and may mimic other primary headache disorders. Other symptoms may include transient visual obscurations (unilateral or bilateral darkening of the vision typically seconds), pulsatile tinnitus, back pain, dizziness, neck pain, visual blurring, cognitive disturbances, radicular pain and typically horizontal diplopia (figure 1A): none of which are pathognomonic for IIH.Investigation and management depends on symptoms and signs and requires an interdisciplinary team approach.

For the individual patient, some can have permanent visual loss.Chronic headache significantly impacts quality of lifewith over half of patients with IIH reporting ongoing headaches at 12 months.

Clinical uncertainty exists, and IIH can be misdiagnosed.The 2015 Cochrane review has concluded that there is lack of evidence to guide pharmacological treatment in IIH.Randomised clinical trials are currently infrequent in this field due to the rarity of the disease, the lack of understanding of the underlying pathological mechanisms and limited disease-modifying therapies.

### Idiopathic intracranial hypertension: ongoing clinical challenges and future prospects [^3874d7a4]. Journal of Pain Research (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is an uncommon disorder of increased intracranial pressure (ICP) without radiological and laboratory evidence of intracranial pathology. Even though the clinical presentations of this condition are well-characterized, the pathogenesis remains unclear. Although obese women of childbearing age are typically affected, IIH can affect patients of any age or sex. Incidence of IIH largely varies from 0.03 to 2.36/100,000/year in total population.–As female sex and obesity are the risk factors for IIH, higher incidence was reported in female population (0.65–4.65/100,000/year)–and in obese women (2.7–19.3/100,000/year).In the last decade, its incidence has been rising due to the globally increasing prevalence of obesity.Chronic headache and visual impairment are the main presentation symproms of IIH. Quality of life is also affected by IIH, even in patients with mild visual impairement.

### Idiopathic intracranial hypertension in children: a review and algorithm [^ee01ded0]. Pediatric Neurology (2010). Low credibility.

This updated review of pediatric idiopathic intracranial hypertension focuses on epidemiology, clinical presentations, diagnostic criteria, evaluation, clinical course, and treatment. General guidelines for the clinical management of idiopathic intracranial hypertension are discussed. A new algorithm outlines an efficient management strategy for the initial diagnostic evaluation of children with signs or symptoms of intracranial hypertension. This algorithm provides a systematic approach to initial evaluation and management, and identifies important decision-making factors. The risk of permanent visual loss with idiopathic intracranial hypertension necessitates a prompt, thorough collaborative approach in the management of patients. Although idiopathic intracranial hypertension has been recognized for over a century, the need remains for prospectively collected data to promote a better understanding of the etiology, risk factors, evaluative methods, and effective treatments for children with this syndrome.

### Diagnosis, treatment and monitoring of idiopathic intracranial hypertension: consensus recommendations of the Austrian IIH network (AN4IH) [^54c34322]. Cephalalgia (2025). Medium credibility.

BackgroundThe diagnosis, treatment and monitoring of patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) are highly complex processes that require interdisciplinary collaboration with respect to neurology, ophthalmology, neuroradiology, neurosurgery and endocrinology. Accordingly, there is a consensus among international guidelines that the management of these aspects of care should be the responsibility of specialized centers that are equipped with appropriate facilities. The objective of the Austrian Network for Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension (AN4IH) is to establish a national network of excellence and to provide comprehensive recommendations for the structure and operation of specialized IIH centers (AN4IH centers), including an integrated, interdisciplinary diagnostic and treatment pathway.MethodsThis consensus was developed by an interdisciplinary panel of experts convened by Austrian neurologists, (neuro)ophthalmologists, neuroradiologists, neurosurgeons and endocrinologists. The process adhered to a formal consensus methodology.ResultsThe AN4IH consensus provides a comprehensive, integrated, interdisciplinary framework addressing care infrastructure, urgency stratification, diagnostics, treatment and monitoring, as well as considerations related to family planning and pregnancy in patients with IIH. The AN4IH consensus is explicitly intended as a supplement and extension to existing international guidelines.ConclusionsThe management of IIH necessitates a structured, interdisciplinary approach to optimize patient outcomes. Through formal consensus methodology, the AN4IH provides expert - and where available evidence - based recommendations for specialized care centers, emphasizing standardized diagnostic pathways, urgency stratification and tailored treatment protocols. By fostering collaboration and institutionalizing best practices, the AN4IH model represents a significant advancement in delivering comprehensive, patient-centered care for this complex neurological disorder and encourages participants to create a secure, quality-controlled shared database for the collection of all clinical and paraclinical data, alongside the establishment of a biobank for the storage of biosamples.

### Evaluation and management of adult idiopathic intracranial hypertension [^5dc98f3e]. Practical Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

IIH is commonly associated with obesity, younger age and females.Patients present acutely to many different specialities and often have multiple acute visits through the course of their disease. The investigation and management of IIH is complex involving many specialities.This infographic summarises three key pathways based on the recommendations of a multidisciplinary, patient-involving and multiprofessional specialist interest group on the investigation and management of IIH.

The basis of the specialist interest group included representation from neurology, neurosurgery, neuroradiology, ophthalmology, nursing, primary care doctors and patient representatives. Questions on PICO were defined and through a large Delphi group exercise; expertise was captured from a wide-reaching group of clinicians, thus reflecting practice from across the UK and internationally. The statements were then critically reviewed by key opinion leaders and by Association of British Neurologists, British Association for the Study of Headache, the Society of British Neurological Surgeons and the Royal College of Ophthalmologists. This is the first consensus guidance for optimal management of IIH.

Identification of papilloedema can be challenging, and clinicians should be aware of the differential diagnosis of pseudopapilloedema (figure 1). Once papilloedema is confirmed, it requires urgent investigations, including lumbar puncture, where the patient experience could be greatly improved.Symptoms of IIH are not pathognomonic, and hence it is essential to apply the diagnostic criteria, including excluding secondary causes, for a definite diagnosis.The lumbar puncture opening pressure was one key area of debate. Within the wider Delphi group, it was clear that there is a ‘grey zone’ of lumbar puncture opening pressures between 25 cm cerebrospinal fluid (cmCSF) and 30 cmCSF, as to what each expert considered to be pathological, and this is reflected within the infographic thermometer for lumbar puncture opening pressure (figure 1).

### A practical approach to, diagnosis, assessment and management of idiopathic intracranial hypertension [^e1aa31a7]. Practical Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

Management

Disease evolution and outcomes in IIH are poorly characterised and are currently being evaluated in the National IIH:LIFE study (centres interested in participating should contact the author, AS). We have noted the following patient types:
Those who rapidly lose vision at diagnosis over days to weeks (rare but vital to identify early).
Those whose disease resolves following diagnosis, over weeks to months, occasionally after a single lumbar puncture (rare).
Those at lower risk of visual loss who develop chronic disease with small fluctuations in disease activity, frequently with weight changes (the majority).
Those in disease remission and off treatment.

For most patients, the clinical priority is to monitor vision and help the disease into remission. The headache symptoms typically comprise the greatest morbidity for these patients (see later). For patients in remission (the fourth cohort) with no papilloedema noted on visits over several years, we will aim to discharge and advise annual optometrist assessments, but return if any symptoms recur.

### Update on idiopathic intracranial hypertension [^fa2ac7af]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose

To provide an update on various features of idiopathic intracranial hypertension.

Design

Perspective.

Methods

Selected articles on the epidemiology, clinical and imaging features, natural history, pathophysiology, and treatment of idiopathic intracranial hypertension were reviewed and interpreted in the context of the authors' clinical and research experience.

Results

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension primarily is a disease of obese women of childbearing age, but it can affect patients of any weight, sex, and age. Although a relatively rare disorder, idiopathic intracranial hypertension's associated costs in the United States entail hundreds of millions of dollars. Even after treatment, headaches frequently are persistent and may require the continued involvement of a neurologist. Quality-of-life reductions and depression are common among idiopathic intracranial hypertension patients. However, visual dysfunction, especially visual field abnormalities, represents the major morbidity of this disorder, and serial automated perimetry remains the primary method of patient monitoring. Patients who are men, black, very obese, or anemic are at higher risk of visual loss. Vitamin A metabolism, adipose tissue as an actively secreting endocrine tissue, and cerebral venous abnormalities are areas of active study regarding the pathophysiology of idiopathic intracranial hypertension. Treatment studies show that lumbar puncture is a valuable treatment (in addition to its crucial diagnostic role), and that weight management is critical. However, open questions remain regarding the efficacy of acetazolamide, cerebrospinal fluid diversion procedures, and cerebral venous stenting.

Conclusions

Many questions remain unanswered about idiopathic intracranial hypertension. Ongoing studies, especially an ongoing National Institutes of Health-funded clinical trial of acetazolamide, should provide more insight into this important, yet poorly understood, syndrome of isolated intracranial hypertension.

### Managing idiopathic intracranial hypertension in pregnancy: practical advice [^61ed1b27]. Practical Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is characterised by raised intracranial pressure that frequently causes chronic headaches and visual loss. It predominately affects women of reproductive age with obesity.Its exact pathophysiological mechanisms are not yet fully established.IIH is associated with central adiposityand recent weight gainand IIH adipocytes appear transcriptionally and metabolically primed towards lipogenesis and adipose accumulation.Other features of metabolic dysregulation in IIH include a doubled risk of cardiovascular disease,androgen excess,and insulin resistance.The document ‘IIH: the international consensus guideline’ is a useful source of information for its management.

Reproductive health in patients with IIH can be complex and there is currently limited guidance to support clinical care. We aim to provide practical guidance for managing women with IIH when approaching and during pregnancy. We discuss its medical and surgical management in relation to pregnancy and suggest limits on gestational weight gain.

Q11 What is the best way to manage headaches in newly diagnosed IIH?

Patients must be informed, at the earliest opportunity, of the potential issues of painkiller overuse that can lead to medication overuse headache (use of simple analgesics on more than 15 days per month or opioids, combined preparations or triptan medication on greater than 10 days per month for more than 3 months).
Short-term painkillers may be helpful in the first few weeks following diagnosis. These could include non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or paracetamol. Indomethacin may have some advantage due to its effect of reducing ICP.Caution is required with potential side effects of NSAIDs, and gastric protection may be needed.
Opioids should not be prescribed for headaches.
Greater occipital nerve blocks maybe considered helpful by some, but there is a lack of evidence and consensus.
Acetazolamide has not been shown to be effective for the treatment of headache alone.
Lumbar punctures are not typically recommended for treatment of headache in IIH (see 7. What is the role of serial lumbar punctures in IIH? in table 3).

Uncertainty

There is no evidence to support the optimal managing of headache in acute IIH.

Q12 What is the best approach for long-term headache management in IIH?

The pattern of headache in IIH often changes over time and needs careful assessment. There is frequently a mixed headache phenotype: headache attributed to IIH, migraine, medication overuse headache, tension-type headache, headache attributed to low CSF pressure and headache attributed to iatrogenic Chiari malformation secondary to CSF shunting.
A multidisciplinary team approach could be considered including, ideally, an assessment by an experienced clinician with an interest in headache management.
In patients with IIH, the headache phenotype should be assessed. Headache therapies should be tailored to the headache phenotype.
IIH patients with headache need clear explanation of how their headaches change over time and how to minimise the risks of developing medication overuse headache.
Early introduction of preventative medications (migraine preventatives) should be considered as these can take 3–4 months to reach maximal efficacy.

Uncertainty

There is no evidence to support the optimal managing of headache in established IIH.

Conclusion

IIH is an uncommon disorder characterized by symptoms and signs of intracranial hypertension without radiologic or laboratory evidence of intracranial pathology. This condition typically affects young-to-middle-aged females with obesity. Visual impairment and severe headache are the major concerns in this condition; thus, the primary treatment purpose is to prevent visual dysfunction and reduce headache severity. Counseling about weight reduction is the initial treatment approach in all obese patients. LP is a diagnostic tool for evaluation of elevated ICP. Medical management is generally the first line of treatment and is adequate in the majority of patients. Acetazolamide and topiramate are the only two medications that have been studied in randomized controlled trials and showed significant improvement of headache and visual outcomes. Acetazolamide is the first-line medication in most patients. In patients with severe optic neuropathy or those who fail medical therapy, surgical management, either CSF diversion or ONSF, and endovascular venous stenting of transverse sinus stenosis are the next available options which have demonstrated satisfactory outcomes on visual function and headache. Table 5 summarizes the long-term outcome of visual function and headache of each intervention in the treatment of refractory IIH. There are many challenges that need to be explored in future research on the diagnosis and treatment of IIH. Many biomarkers have been demonstrated to relate to IIH pathogenesis and may be the targets in the future research. In addition, more prospective, randomized controlled trials are needed to establish a treatment guideline for IIH.

### A practical approach to, diagnosis, assessment and management of idiopathic intracranial hypertension [^ba706d00]. Practical Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

Adult patients who present with papilloedema and symptoms of raised intracranial pressure need urgent multidisciplinary assessment including neuroimaging, to exclude life-threatening causes. Where there is no apparent underlying cause for the raised intracranial pressure, patients are considered to have idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH). The incidence of IIH is increasing in line with the global epidemic of obesity. There are controversial issues in its diagnosis and management. This paper gives a practical approach to assessing patients with papilloedema, its investigation and the subsequent management of patients with IIH.

### Update on the pathophysiology and management of idiopathic intracranial hypertension [^a45d2231]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2012). Low credibility.

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension is a disease of unknown aetiology, typically affecting young obese women, producing a syndrome of increased intracranial pressure without identifiable cause. Despite a large number of hypotheses and publications over the past decade, the aetiology is still unknown. Vitamin A metabolism, adipose tissue as an actively secreting endocrine tissue and cerebral venous abnormalities are areas of active study regarding the pathophysiology of idiopathic intracranial hypertension. There continues to be no evidence based consensus or formal guidelines regarding management and treatment of the disease. Treatment studies show that the diagnostic lumbar puncture is a valuable intervention beyond its diagnostic importance, and that weight management is critical. However, many questions remain regarding the efficacy of acetazolamide, CSF shunting procedures and cerebral transverse venous sinus stenting.

### Weight management communications in idiopathic intracranial hypertension: challenges and recommendations from the patients' perspective [^0905b6ab]. BMJ Neurology Open (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is characterised by increased intracranial pressure leading to reported signs and symptoms such as headache, pulsatile tinnitus and papilloedema, with the potential risk of permanent visual loss.Although the exact causes of this condition remain unknown it occurs more often in women of childbearing age compared with men and children as well as in people who are overweight (body mass index, BMI, 25–30 kg/m 2) or who live with obesity (BMI≥30 kg/m 2).The global annual IIH incidence rates range from 0.03 to 2.36 per 100 000 and are positively associated with country-specific obesity rates.In the UK, there has been a stepwise increase in the incidence and prevalence of IIH with increasing numbers of people being admitted to hospital care.

The use of specialised healthcare by people living with IIH (PwIIH) causes a significant economic burden on the National Health Services (NHS) with estimated direct healthcare resource use costs of £462 million per annum by 2030.This has also been demonstrated in the USA.Additionally, research states that PwIIH experience low quality of life mainly due to their headache symptoms; however, research into other factors contributing to this is limited. This stresses the importance of more research into effective and acceptable weight management interventions for PwIIH.

There is a striking association with increased BMI and moderate weight gain.The disease is modified by weight loss and a recent randomised controlled trial evaluating bariatric surgery and a multicomponent lifestyle intervention found that weight loss mirrored reduction in intracranial pressure.A weight loss in the region of between 3% and 24% has been shown to reduce symptoms and lead to remission of the disease whereas regaining 6% of body weight has been shown to be associated with recurrence of IIH among some PwIIH as demonstrated by one study.The condition is managed by neurologists, ophthalmologists, neurosurgeons and more recently interventional radiologists, none of whom have formal training in weight management.

### Managing idiopathic intracranial hypertension in pregnancy: practical advice [^715d493a]. Practical Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Weight management

Body weight is a potentially modifiable risk factor in IIH; thus, women ideally should achieve a healthy body weight before conception.The WHO defines obesity as a body mass index (BMI) ≥30 kg/m 2 ; however, in ethnic minorities this is lower at 27.5 kg/m 2 due to their associated higher risks.Increased weight is a stigmatised area of healthcare and clinicians should broach this topic sensitively and with the patient’s permission. Local weight management services can offer practical support for first-line interventionswith diet, physical activity and behaviour change. The target for initial weight loss in women with obesity planning a pregnancy is typically 5%–10% of preconception weight;a normal BMI (18.5 to 24.9 kg/m 2) target,although ideal, may not be realistic. Bariatric surgery can achieve lower and sustained reductions in intracranial pressure and put IIH into remission but is not appropriate for all.Following bariatric surgery, guidance suggests women wait at least 18 months before conceiving to enable optimisation of weight management and management of nutritional deficiencies.Dietary supplementation may be required, and we recommend consulting with a physician or dietician with expertise in the management of bariatric surgery patients for those planning conception or are newly pregnant.

Sustained weight loss therefore is essential for long-term remission of the disease. However, clinical practice is varied in how to deliver the most effective weight loss strategies for IIH. Indeed, sustained weight loss has been demonstrated to be essential for long-term remission of the disease.The optimal weight loss method for IIH is yet to be determined,especially in the context of the chronic relapsing nature of obesity.

Hence, the aim of this study was to identify, evaluate, and summarize the relevant published studies relating to weight loss interventions for IIH for their ability to deliver sustained weight loss and impact on key outcomes, such as vision and headache. A second aim of this study was to convene a panel of experts in the field of IIH and weight management to review the evidence and provide practice points to help guide clinicians who may not have formal training in weight management.

### Idiopathic intracranial hypertension: ongoing clinical challenges and future prospects [^04cea11c]. Journal of Pain Research (2016). Low credibility.

Current management

The primary goal of treatment of IIH is to prevent visual loss and decrease headache and other symptoms associated with intracranial hypertension. Routine follow-up by neuroophthalmologist or ophthalmologist is very essential for reassessing visual status and degree of papilledema. Weight reduction counseling and medical management are generally sufficient in most patients. Surgery is required only in patients who have severe visual loss, progressive visual loss, or intractable headache despite aggressive medical management. Aggressive weight reduction is necessary in obese patients. Gastric bypass surgery has been demonstrated to improve visual outcomes and reduce ICP in IIH cases with morbid obesity.

Although there are many options for the treatment of IIH, the most recent Cochrane review reported that there is insufficient information to generate an evidence-based management for IIH.

Pharmacotherapy

To date, acetazolamide and topiramate are the only two medications that have been studied in randomized controlled trials for their treatment efficacy in adults with IIH. The efficacy of other medications is only supported by case reports or case series. For example, there was a case series reporting the efficacy of combination of acetazolamide and furosemide in eight children in 1994.Corticosteroid was reported to be effective in the short-term in patients who presented with severe papilledema and severe visual loss. However, steroid withdrawal and its side effect on weight gain are precipitating factors for worsening IIH in long-term use. A summary of the trials of acetazolamide and topiramate in treatment of IIH in adults are discussed in the following sections.

### What is new about idiopathic intracranial hypertension? An updated review of mechanism and treatment [^a0813232]. Cephalalgia (2006). Low credibility.

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is the syndrome of raised intracranial pressure without clinical, laboratory or radiological evidence of intracranial pathology. IIH is a relatively rare disease but rapidly increasing incidence is reported due to a global increasing incidence of obesity. Disease course is generally said to be self-limiting within a few months. However, some patients experience a disabling condition of chronic severe headache and visual disturbances for years that limit their capacity to work. Permanent visual defects are serious and not infrequent complications. The pathophysiology of IIH is still not fully understood. Advances in neuroimaging techniques have facilitated the exclusion of associated conditions that may mimic IIH. No causal treatment is yet known for IIH and existing treatment is symptomatic and rarely sufficient. The aim of this review is to provide an updated overview of this potentially disabling disease which may show a future escalating incidence due to obesity. Theories of pathogenesis, diagnostic criteria and treatment strategies are discussed.

### Managing idiopathic intracranial hypertension in the eye clinic [^39cc849a]. Eye (2024). Medium credibility.

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is a syndrome of elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) with specific diagnostic criteria. It occurs most commonly in young women and there is evidence of dysregulated androgens. It is principally associated with obesity, however there are systemic metabolic findings which are unique to IIH, that are not conferred by living with obesity alone. The incidence of IIH is increasing worldwide, and as many ophthalmologists now diagnose and manage IIH, high quality research and practice guidelines are required to provide excellence and equity of care. Both physicians and patients are central to improving care and identifying those areas which require a change in practice. In this “how to do it” article the foundations of managing IIH in ophthalmology outpatients have been considered through a case based approach. As IIH in childhood (pre-puberty) and IIH without papilloedema are expectantly different conditions, this article will focus on adults with IIH. This is an outline of how IIH is managed in our ophthalmology clinics, though others may prefer a different approach.

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH), also called pseudotumor cerebri syndrome, is a disorder defined as elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) of unknown cause. It is a diagnosis of exclusion in most cases, and all other forms of elevated ICP must be ruled out. With its increasing prevalence, it is much more likely for physicians, otolaryngologists included, to encounter this condition. It is important to have a clear understanding of the typical and atypical presentation of this disease, along with its evaluative workup and management options.

Literature Clinical Pearls & Morning Reports Published January 17, 2018 Increased intracranial pressure that does not have a defined cause, which is known as idiopathic intracranial hypertension or pseudotumor cerebri, is a disorder that predominantly affects obese women of childbearing age. Read the latest Case Records of the Massachusetts General Hospital here. Clinical Pearls Q: What are the signs that distinguish true optic-disk edema from pseudopapilledema. . A: The 10 signs of true optic-disk edema can be assessed on a fundus examination. The 5 mechanical signs are loss of the physiological cup, elevation of the disk, blurring of the disk margins, edema of the nerve fiber layer, and folds of the retina or choroid. The 5 vascular signs are hyperemia of the disk, venous dilatation and tortuosity, peripapillary hemorrhages, infarct of the nerve fiber layer, and exudates. Q: What are transient visual obscurations.

A: Episodes of painless vision loss that last only seconds and are aggravated by changes in position, such as bending over, are referred to as transient visual obscurations. The brevity of transient visual obscurations distinguishes them from amaurosis fugax and other considerations, such as migraine. Transient visual obscurations occur in the context of optic-disk edema and are thought to result from changes in position that affect perfusion to the swollen optic-nerve heads. They are a common symptom in patients with papilledema. A: Papilledema is optic-disk edema that is caused by increased intracranial pressure, whereas papillitis is optic-disk edema that is caused by an optic neuropathy or damage to the optic nerve.

The characteristic features of papillitis due to an acquired optic neuropathy include decreased visual acuity, loss or impairment of color vision, a relative afferent pupillary defect, and visual-field defects. In affected patients, the optic-disk swelling is usually unilateral, with the major exception being swelling due to hypertensive crisis. In contrast, patients with papilledema initially have no vision symptoms and usually have normal visual acuity, color vision, and pupillary responses, with no relative afferent pupillary defect. Visual-field testing commonly reveals enlarged blind spots in both eyes, and as the disease progresses, the peripheral nasal fields become affected. Central visual-field defects develop late in the course of papilledema, and these are usually accompanied by decreased visual acuity and dyschromatopsia.

A relative afferent pupillary defect is present only in highly asymmetric cases, in which the optic-disk edema and subsequent vision loss are worse in one eye. A: Headaches caused by increased intracranial pressure can be similar to migraines, which are unilateral throbbing or tension headaches that are associated with photophobia, phonophobia, nausea, and vomiting and are often preceded by a visual aura with a scintillating or zigzag pattern that lasts for 20 to 60 minutes. Unlike migraines, headaches caused by increased intracranial pressure may be accompanied by tinnitus characterized by a whooshing noise in one or both ears that occurs in synchronization with the pulse. The headache and tinnitus are typically worse when the patient is lying flat and better when the patient is sitting or standing. Headaches caused by increased intracranial pressure are often accompanied by transient visual obscurations.

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) has an estimated incidence of one to three people per 100,000 people per year, and occurs most commonly in obese, young women. IIH is associated with severe morbidity, notably due to a significant threat to sight and severe headache. Several different management options have been proposed. Conservative measures centre on weight loss. Pharmacological therapy includes use of diuretics. Refractory and sight-threatening cases demand surgical intervention, most often in the form of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) diversion or optic nerve sheath fenestration. Other treatments include venous sinus stenting and bariatric surgery.

Objectives

To assess the effects of any intervention for IIH in any patient group.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group Trials Register) (2015 Issue 6), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid MEDLINE In-Process and Other Non-Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE Daily, Ovid OLDMEDLINE (January 1946 to July 2015), EMBASE (January 1980 to July 2015), the ISRCTN registry (www.isrctn.com/editAdvancedSearch), ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov) and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (www.who.int/ictrp/search/en). We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials. We last searched the electronic databases on 22 July 2015.

Selection Criteria

We included only randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in which any intervention was compared to placebo, or to another form of treatment, for people with a clinical diagnosis of IIH.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed the search results for trials to be included in the review. We resolved any discrepancies by third party decision.

Main Results

We identified two completed RCTs (enrolling a total of 211 participants and conducted in the UK and US) and two ongoing trials that met the inclusion criteria. Both completed trials compared acetazolamide to placebo, in conjunction with a weight loss intervention in both groups. Attrition bias was a problem in both trials with high loss to follow-up, in one study this loss to follow-up occurred particularly in the acetazolamide arm. One trial was unmasked and we judged it to be at risk of performance and detection bias.In these studies, change in visual acuity was similar in the treatment and control groups as measured by logMAR acuity. In one study people in the acetalomazide group had a similar change in logMAR acuity compared to the placebo group between baseline and 12 months in the right eye (MD 0.04 logMAR, 95% CI -0.08 to 0.16) and left eye (MD 0.03 logMAR, 95% CI -0.09 to 0.15). In the other study people in the acetalomazide group had a similar change in vision over six months compared with people in the placebo group (mean difference in change in letters read was 0.01 (95% CI -1.45 to 1.46). One study reported no cases of visual loss in 21 people treated with acetalomazide compared to 2/20 cases in the placebo group (odds ratio 0.17, 95% CI 0.01, 3.82).The prespecified outcome for this review was reduction in CSF pressure to normal levels which was not reported by the two trials. One trial reported that, in a subsample of 85 participants who agreed to lumbar puncture at 6 months, people in the acetalomazide group on average had a greater reduction in CSF pressure (MD -59.9 mmH(2)O, 95% CI -96.4, -23.4).In one study, people in the acetalozamide group on average experienced a greater reduction in papilloedema as assessed by fundus photographs MD -0.70 (95% CI -1.00 to -0.40) and by clinical grading MD -0.91 (95% CI -1.27 to -0.54) between baseline and six months in the study eye.Headache was recorded as present/absent in one study at 12 months (OR 0.42, 95% CI 0.12,1.41, 41 participants). Both studies reported headache on visual analogue scales (different ones) but results were inconclusive (MD for change in headache score measured on 10-point visual analogue scale at 12 months was 1.0 (-1.80, 3.70, 41 participants) and MD for change in headache score on a 6 point scale measured at 6 months was -0.45 (-3.5,2.6, number of participants unclear).In one study, a similar proportion of people in the acetalomazide group were in remission (however, the trial authors did not state their definition of this term) at 12 months compared to the placebo group. However, the 95% CIs were wide and there is considerable uncertainty as to the effect (OR 1.13 (95% CI 0.32 to 3.90, 41 participants).In one study of 185 participants, people in the acetalomazide group had an increased risk of decreased CO2, diarrhoea, dysgeusia, fatigue, nausea, paresthesia, tinnitus and vomiting compared to people in the placebo group. In general, the estimates of effect were uncertain with wide 95% CIs. Adverse effects were not reported in the other study.One study reported that quality of life was better in acetazolamide-treated patients based on the visual quality of life (VFQ-25) (MD 6.35, 95% CI 2.22 to 10.47) and the physical (MD 3.02, 95% CI 0.34 to 5.70) and mental (MD 3.45, 95% CI 0.35 to 6.55) components of the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey tool at six months. Costs were not reported in either study.We judged the evidence to be low certainty (GRADE) downgrading for imprecision and risk of bias.

Authors' Conclusions

Although the two included RCTs showed modest benefits for acetazolamide for some outcomes, there is insufficient evidence to recommend or reject the efficacy of this intervention, or any other treatments currently available, for treating people with IIH. Further high-quality RCTs are required in order to adequately assess the effect of acetazolamide therapy in people with IIH.

### Idiopathic intracranial hypertension: consensus guidelines on management [^b377e61b]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

Methods

An SIG was formed, including neurology, neurosurgery, neuroradiology, ophthalmology, nursing, primary care doctors and patient representatives. All clinicians had expertise in managing IIH. An initial UK survey of attitudes and practice in IIH was sent to a wide group of consultants who investigate and manage IIH regularly: these included neurology, neurosurgery, neuro-ophthalmology and neuroradiology. A comprehensive systemic literature review was performed to assemble the foundations of the statements. Rigorous controlled data are sparse in IIH, and therefore, a consensus-based guide is presented. Questions were formulated (table 1). An anonymous modified Delphi process was used to obtain consensus on guidance statements. All statements below obtained consensus of 75% or above from the SIG and wider Delphi group. A completed AGREE statement is found as supplementary data (online supplementary appendix 1).

An international panel of experts in IIH (RHJ, GTL and KD) reviewed the document and a wider consultation was made with professional bodies namely the Association of British Neurologists (ABN), the Society of British Neurological Surgeons (SBNS), the Royal College of Ophthalmologists (RCOphth) and the British Association for the Study of Headache (BASH). Where there was disagreement in statement recommendations, these were debated within the SIG, and wording was altered accordingly.

Specifically, to improve local outcomes for patients with IIH, audit recommendations are enclosed (online supplementary appendix 2). This document will need to be revised regularly as new evidence emerges in the field of IIH. Definitions used in the guidance are presented in table 2.

### Idiopathic intracranial hypertension: ongoing clinical challenges and future prospects [^448373a0]. Journal of Pain Research (2016). Low credibility.

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is an uncommon disorder characterized by increased intracranial pressure without radiological or laboratory evidence of intracranial pathology except empty sella turcica, optic nerve sheath with filled out cerebrospinal fluid spaces, and smooth-walled nonflow-related venous sinus stenosis or collapse. This condition typically affects obese women. The incidence of IIH is increasing with the rising prevalence of obesity. Persistent headache is the most common symptom. Visual impairment is a serious complication that may not be recognized by the patients. This paper reviews clinical manifestations, diagnostic challenges, and current treatments of IIH in adults. Various imaging modalities have been studied on their validity for detection of IIH and papilledema. This review also includes new studies on medical, surgical, and interventional management of this condition. Acetazolamide and topiramate are the only two medications that have been studied in randomized controlled trials about their efficacy in treatment of IIH. In patients who have severe visual impairment or progressive visual deterioration despite medical management, surgical or interventional treatment may be considered. The efficacy and complications of cerebrospinal fluid diversion, optic nerve sheath fenestration, and endovascular venous stenting reported in the last 3 decades have been summarized in this review. Finally, the prospective aspects of biomarkers and treatments are proposed for future research.

Regarding specific circumstances for idiopathic intracranial hypertension, more specifically with respect to patients with IIH without papilledema, ABN/BASH/RCOphth/SBNS 2018 guidelines recommend to manage patients with definite diagnosis of idiopathic intracranial hypertension without papilledema as typical idiopathic intracranial hypertension and counsel about weight management.

### Idiopathic intracranial hypertension [^cf1784ea]. The Lancet: Neurology (2006). Medium credibility.

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension is common in obese women and can lead to significant visual impairment. First described more than 100 years ago, the cause of the disorder remains unknown. Despite a multitude of proposed links, the aetiology has never been established. Impairment of cerebrospinal-fluid reabsorption is the most likely underlying pathophysiological cause of the raised pressure, but this notion has yet to be proven. Cerebral venous sinus abnormalities associated with the disorder need further exploration. Although the major symptoms of headache and visual disturbance are well documented, most data for disease outcome have been from small retrospective case series. No randomised controlled trials of treatment have been done and the management is controversial. The importance of weight loss needs clarification, the role of diuretics is uncertain, and which surgical intervention is the most effective and safe is unknown. Prospective trials to examine these issues are urgently needed.

### Evaluation and management of adult idiopathic intracranial hypertension [^8c28ea1e]. Practical Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Horizon scanning for IIH shows that research is active and that metabolic concepts may potentially provide more understanding of the cause and provide evidence for innovative therapeutic opportunities.A phase 2 randomised control trial with the first novel drug treatment for IIH has finished recruitment; a phase 3 randomised control trial investigating the best method for weight loss is underway; other surgical trials are in planning.

This infographic highlights three areas that are covered by the consensus guideline for adult IIH, which are: (1) investigation of papilloedema and diagnosis of IIH; (2) management strategies; and (3) investigation and management of acute exacerbation of headache in established IIH(figure 1).

Key points

Cerebral venography is an essential part of the work-up to exclude venous sinus thrombosis as a cause of papilloedema.
Lumbar puncture opening pressure forms part of the diagnostic criteria; however, most clinicians feel there is a ‘grey zone’ between 25 cmCSF and 30 cmCSF, which may not be pathological.
Those with fulminant or precipitous visual decline need urgent surgical treatment, preferably with a ventriculoperintoneal shunt.
All patients diagnosed with idiopathic intracranial hypertension need sensitive and appropriate discussion regarding weight loss (the only disease-modifying treatment).
Those with acute exacerbation of headache do not require further neuroimaging or repeat lumbar puncture, unless there are red flag symptoms/signs of infection, or papilloedema with precipitous visual decline.

### Emerging themes in idiopathic intracranial hypertension [^b4543e8b]. Journal of Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is a rare disorder characterised by raised intracranial pressure. The underlying pathophysiology is mostly unknown and effective treatment is an unmet clinical need in this disease. This review evaluates key emerging themes regarding disease characteristics, mechanisms contributing to raised intracranial pressure and advances in potential therapeutic targets.

Findings

IIH is becoming more common, with the incidence rising in parallel with the global obesity epidemic. Current medical management remains centred around weight management, which is challenging. Metabolic investigations of patients have identified specific androgen profiles in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which suggest an endocrine dysfunction impacting CSF secretion in IIH. Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11β-HSD1) have been found to play a role in CSF dynamics in IIH and have formed the basis of the first clinical trials looking at new treatments.

Conclusions

Identification of novel molecular targets thought to underlie IIH pathology is now being translated to clinical trials.

Q7 What is the role of serial lumbar punctures in IIH?

The relief from a LP is typically short lived as CSF is secreted from the choroid plexus at a rate of 25 mL/hour and consequently the volume removed in a so-called therapeutic tap is rapidly replaced.
Serial lumbar punctures are not recommended for management of IIH.
Despite the relief of headache in nearly three quarters of patients,LPs are associated with significant anxiety in many patients and can led to acute and chronic back pain in some patients.

Q8 What is the best drug treatment for IIH symptoms?

The current Cochrane review on IIH management reported on the use of acetazolamide, a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, in IIH. It concluded: ‘the two included RCTs showed modest benefits for acetazolamide for some outcomes, there is insufficient evidence to recommend or reject the efficacy of this intervention, or any other treatments currently available, for treating people with IIH’.

The two studies included in this review were:
The IIH Treatment Trialreported the use of acetazolamide with a low-sodium weight-reduction diet compared with diet alone resulted in modest improvement in visual field function in patients with mild visual loss. The IIHTT also reported improved quality of life outcomes at 6 months with acetazolamide.
Ball et al failed to show a treatment effect. Importantly, 48% discontinued acetazolamide due to adverse effects.

Acetazolamide could be prescribed for those with IIH symptoms.
All females with IIH when commencing any new medical therapy (whether IIH specific or headache related) must be counselled regarding side effects and potential teratogenetic risks (see 21. What additional considerations for management are there in the pregnant patient with IIH? in table 3).
Drug therapies may need to be altered due to adverse side effects, lack of efficacy, possible potential teratogenic effects in pregnancy or patient preference.

Uncertainty

In view of the limited evidence as reported by the 2015 Cochrane reviewand the side effect profile, not all clinicians in the UK prescribe acetazolamide for IIH.

### Idiopathic intracranial hypertension: a step change in understanding the disease mechanisms [^05a2fa60]. Nature Reviews: Neurology (2023). High credibility.

The understanding of idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) has evolved over the past few years. Previously, IIH was considered a disease exclusively affecting the neuro-ophthalmic axis, characterized by raised intracranial pressure, headache and papilloedema, and resulting in the risk of severe and permanent visual loss and life-changing disabling headaches. Recent advances have begun to redefine IIH as a probable metabolic disease involving a range of systemic manifestations. More than 95% of individuals affected by the disease are women of reproductive age with obesity. The incidence is rapidly rising and parallels the escalating worldwide obesity rates. Contemporary insights identify associations with insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes and a twofold increased risk of cardiovascular disease in excess of that driven by obesity alone. Adipose distribution in people with IIH, like that in other metabolic diseases, is preferentially centripetal and is associated with changes in intracranial pressure. Evidence now demonstrates adipose tissue dysfunction in people with IIH, involving transcriptional and metabolic priming for lipogenesis and weight gain. Hormonal perturbations are also observed, including a unique phenotype of androgen excess that promotes cerebrospinal fluid secretion. Knowledge of these additional disease features is driving research into novel therapeutic targets and altering the approach to multidisciplinary care.

Uncertainties

Clinicians debate the absolute LP opening value of 25 cm CSF as diagnostic of IIH. This was recognised by Friedman and colleagues.Below the cut-off of 25 cm CSF, there are reservations as to the likelihood of diagnosing IIH. As highlighted in figure 1E, the SIG clinicians’ opinions are that there is an increasing likelihood of the significance of LP OP measurement, as it rises. The LP OP is a single measurement, and it is widely recognised that there is a diurnal and wide variation in CSF pressure.

Where the LP OP does not fit the clinical picture, it should be interpreted with caution. A repeat LP may be considered or intracranial ICP monitoring could be considered. There is no current evidence to dictate how much CSF is recommended to be drained or what the closing pressure should be.
Exclusion of all other secondary causes of raised ICP All should have a careful history taken to exclude any possible secondary causes that have previously been linked to raised intracranial hypertension (table 2), although the causal link with IIH and a number of diseases and medications is not clear. All patients should have a full blood count performed to exclude anaemia. Where patients are deemed to be atypical (table 1), other additional blood tests may be considered to exclude secondary causes. Where patients are deemed to be atypical (table 1), additional neuroimaging might be considered. These may include more proximal imaging of the neck vasculature to exclude internal jugular obstruction.

Uncertainty

In those with IIH, there is no clear evidence of a contraindication for using medications (including the oral contraceptive) that have been previously been reported to be casually associated with secondary pseudotumour.

Where uncertainty exists, patients who have atypical aspects could be referred for an opinion from a experienced clinician familiar with IIH.

Q3 How should IIH be treated when there is imminent risk of visual loss?

Where there is evidence of declining visual function, the acute management to preserve vision is surgical.
A temporising measure of a lumbar drain could be useful to protect the vision while planning urgent surgical treatment.
There is evidence that many of the surgical procedures, such as CSF diversion and optic nerve sheath fenestration (ONSF), work well in the short term.While they are working, the underlying disease should be modified with weight loss (see 1. What is the best way to modify the disease to induce remission? in table 3).

Uncertainty

In the absence of high class evidence, we do not recommend the use of corticosteroids for fulminant IIH at this time, and indeed a prolonged treatment course of corticosteroids would not be recommended due to weight gain.

Q4 What is currently the best surgical procedure for visual loss in IIH?

In the UK, the preferred surgical procedure is neurosurgical CSF diversion (see 5. What other surgical procedures are performed for visual loss IIH?).
Where possible. it should be performed by a experienced clinician with an interest in CSF disorders.
Ventriculoperitoneal (VP) should be the preferred CSF diversion procedure for visual deterioration in IIH, due to lower reported revisions per patient.
An LP shunt could also be used.
It is best practice to use neuronavigation to place VP shunts.
All patients in the UK should be counselled that they should inform the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency following VP shunt placement.
Adjustable valves with antigravity or antisiphon devices should be considered for use to reduce the risk of low pressure headaches.

Uncertainty

The literature pertaining to shunt type is observational and mainly case series based. Complications of shunts include abdominal pain, shunt obstruction, migration and infection, low pressure headaches, subdural haematoma and tonsillar herniation.There is a low, but present, mortality rate with CSF diversion; these figures do not come from IIH cohorts.

Epidemiology

The incidence and prevalence of IIH depend on the geographical location of the population studied; Andrews et al highlighted the diversity in the worldwide epidemiology for IIH and cautioned against comparing the rates because of inconsistent definitions of obesity used in various studies. Evidence from the literature suggests an incidence between 1 and 3/100 000/year in the general population. When stratified for reproductive age, female gender and weight, the incidence rises by 12–28/100 000/year.

### Advances in the understanding of headache in idiopathic intracranial hypertension [^5933aa29]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To review the most relevant developments in the understanding of headache in idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH).

Recent Findings

The phenotype of the typical IIH headache is diverging from the historical thinking of a raised intracranial pressure headache, with the majority being classified as having migraine. A larger proportion of those with IIH have a past medical history of migraine, compared with the general population, highlighting the importance of re-examining those who have a change or escalation in their headache. The mechanisms underlying headache in IIH are not understood. Additionally, factors which confer a poor headache prognosis are not established. It is clear, however, that headache has a detrimental effect on all aspects of the patient's quality of life and is currently ranked highly as a research priority by IIH patients to better understand the pathophysiology of headache in IIH and identification of potential headache specific therapeutic agents.

Summary

Headache remains the predominate morbidity in the majority of those with IIH. Headache management is an unmet need in IIH and future studies are required to investigate the probable complex mechanisms, as well as effective management.

Managing the headache

The priority for patients with chronic IIH is usually the control of disabling headaches. IIH headache characteristics are very variable. Many do not have the classical features of IIH headache described by the International Headache Society(progressive, daily, diffuse, non-pulsatile headache with aggravation by coughing or straining).We note that pressure features, such as aggravation with Valsalva or cough and severity worse in the morning (having been recumbent in the night) often do not occur, particularly as the condition becomes more chronic. The headaches typically alter during the course of the disease. In keeping with the literature, we find that headaches are often multifactorial, either due to raised intracranial pressure, low pressure, medication overuse headache, migraine or a combination of these.Migrainous features are particularly common (>70% of patients).Our practice, particularly in those in whom headache is the principal complaint, is to evaluate the headache phenotype fully and to focus treatment towards the principal headache type. Those with chronic burnt-out disease—typically with stable vision and no or minimal papilloedema—often have the greatest headache disability. There is little evidence base to guide headache management in IIH. We look for, educate about, and treat the frequent situation of medication overuse in IIH. We successfully use topiramate—a migraine prophylactic agent with weak carbonic anhydrase inhibitor activity and an appetite suppressant (in about 10%),—to treat headache in IIH. Amitriptyline also helps to reduce the impact of migrainous headaches. A headache diary is very useful, not just to quantify the headache load, but also for the patient.

Q13 What therapeutic strategies are useful for headache in IIH?

Migrainous phenotype is noted in 68% of IIH patients with headache.Despite the lack of clinical trials, the use of migraine therapies in IIH patients with migraine headaches may be useful. Headaches with migrainous features include moderate to severe pain that maybe throbbing with photophobia, phonophobia, nausea and movement intolerance.
Migraine attacks may benefit from triptan acute therapy used in combination with either a NSAID or paracetamol and an antiemetic with prokinetic properties.Their use should be limited to 2 days per week or a maximum of 10 days per month.
Migraine preventative strategies could also be tried. These are most likely to be effective in those in whom the ICP is settling and also in those whom the papilloedema has resolved (IIH in ocular remission).
National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence guidelines for migraine prevention therapy is useful.
Caution must be observed before selecting drugs that could increase weight (beta blockers, tricyclic antidepressants, sodium valproate, pizotifen and flunarizine) or those that could exacerbate depression, a frequent comorbidity in IIH (beta blockers, topiramate and flunarizine).
Topiramate (see 10. Are there other drugs that are helpful in IIH? in table 3) may help with weight loss by suppressing appetite and have an effect on reducing ICP through carbonic anhydrase inhibition. Patients need to be cautioned about potential side effects of depression, cognitive slowing, reduction of the efficacy of the contraceptive pill/oral contraceptives and potential of teratogenic effects.
Where topiramate has excessive side effects, zonisamide may be an alternative.
In patients with migraine, candesartan can be a useful alternative to a beta blocker due to its lack of weight gain and depressive side effects.Alternatively, venlafaxine is weight neutral and helpful with depression symptoms.
Botulinum toxin A may be useful in those with coexisting chronic migraine; there are no studies of botulinum toxin A in IIH.
As with treatment of migraine, preventative drugs need to be started slowly and increased to a therapeutic tolerated dose for 3 months to enable a therapeutic trial.
Similar to the treatment of migraine, many of these drugs are used off label in IIH.
Lifestyle advice should be given with all headache disorders, as these can have considerable impact on the disease course. Strategies should be implemented to limit caffeine intake. Ensure regular meals and adequate hydration, exercise programme and sleep hygiene. Behavioural and stress management techniques can be implemented such as yoga, cognitive–behavioural therapy and mindfulness.

When and how to talk about weight management

Central to the care of a person with IIH is a sensitive discussion about the role of body weight and its association with IIH. This should be done by professionals who manage IIH, or preferably by those that manage obesity. A casual conversation of body weight in the emergency setting may do more harm than good. Weight loss methods have evolved over time and the evidence from studies demonstrated good correlation between weight loss and disease remission, however sustained weight loss has not generally been achievable through dietary interventions alone.

The IIH weight trial (IIHWT) was a United Kingdom (UK) multicenter randomised controlled trial that evaluated the effect of bariatric surgery and a community weight management intervention on intracranial pressure in women with active IIH and a body mass index of 35 kg/m 2 or greater. It found that bariatric surgery provided sustained ICP reduction and weight loss for up to two years of follow-up. A health economic analysis was undertaken and this showed by five years, bariatric surgery was more cost-effective than a dietary weight management programme. A per protocol analysis of this trial helped determine how much weight should be lost to ensure disease remission, as defined by normalisation of ICP measured by a lumbar puncture. This was found to be 24% of body weight. This magnitude of weight loss is likely only to be achieved with bariatric surgery. The IIHWT was successful in its primary outcome, however there was no statistical improvement in visual fields. This was likely as it was a cohort of patients with a long duration of the disease. It should also be noted that 24% weight reduction may not be required for remission of papilloedema, where others have found weight reduction of between 5–15% beneficial. A systematic review of weight loss in IIH may be a useful aide.

While metabolic and bariatric surgery will deliver additional health benefits, by reversing life-threatening weight related health problems such as certain cancers, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes ; there are many barriers to accessing the weight management pathways. In the UK there are various programmes that people with an abnormal BMI potentially may have access to (Table 1): unfortunately, due to supply and demand a number of services may be gapped in certain regions.

### A practical approach to, diagnosis, assessment and management of idiopathic intracranial hypertension [^0ec3a59f]. Practical Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Patients presenting with papilloedema need careful evaluation and timely investigation. This is required to exclude all other causes of swollen optic nerves and raised intracranial pressure: IIH is a diagnosis of exclusion. Acute management depends on the immediate risk to vision. For most patients, this is a chronic condition associated with significant disability from headache. Disease-modifying therapy is weight loss. CSF shunting should be considered temporary. IIH requires a multidisciplinary approach involving ophthalmologists, neurologists and neurosurgeons. These patients are best managed in centres with expertise in IIH.

Practice points

Distinguishing papilloedema from pseudopapilloedema is not always straightforward, and may require a senior ophthalmology opinion.
Pseudotumour cerebri describes raised intracranial pressure and papilloedema in the absence of a space-occupying lesion and can be caused by several conditions (box 2). Idiopathic intracranial hypertension is a diagnosis of exclusion where NO cause can be found.
A single lumbar puncture opening pressure reading can be misleading. Where the opening pressure is out of keeping with the clinical picture, the clinician should review the whole case.
Monitoring of visual fields can be problematic in many patients who have functional overlay.
Treat the patient. High-risk patients lose vision rapidly. Headaches may be multifactorial, and require specialist evaluation and treatment to reduce disability.

### Idiopathic intracranial hypertension [^061fa94d]. Cephalalgia (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension or pseudotumour cerebri is primarily a disorder of young obese women characterised by symptoms and signs associated with raised intracranial pressure in the absence of a space-occupying lesion or other identifiable cause.

Summary

The overall incidence of idiopathic intracranial hypertension is approximately two per 100,000, but is considerably higher among obese individuals and, given the global obesity epidemic, is likely to rise further. The pathophysiology of this condition is poorly understood, but most theories focus on the presence of intracranial venous hypertension and/or increased cerebrospinal fluid outflow resistance and how this relates to obesity. A lack of randomised clinical trials has resulted in unsatisfactory treatment guidelines and although weight loss is important, especially when used in conjunction with drugs that reduce cerebrospinal fluid production, resistant cases remain difficult to manage and patients invariably undergo neurosurgical shunting procedures. The use of transverse cerebral sinus stenting remains contentious and long-term benefits are yet to be determined.

Conclusion

An understanding of the clinical features, diagnostic work-up and therapeutic options available for patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension is important both for neurologists and ophthalmologists as visual loss maybe permanent if untreated.

### Managing idiopathic intracranial hypertension in pregnancy: practical advice [^79a32560]. Practical Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Weight management

Weight management is a key issue in IIH. Weight loss is disease-modifying and can put IIH into remissionwhereas weight gain can exacerbate it.Pregnancy leads to weight gain and consequently risks exacerbating IIH. Excessive weight gain during pregnancy also increases the risk of complications for baby and mother.Providing advice to pregnant women with IIH on how to approach weight gain in pregnancy is essential.

There are currently no evidence-based guidelines for limiting weight gain in pregnancy for women with IIH. The US Institute of Medicine (IoM) guidelines (2009) are used internationally to guide weight gain in pregnancy for women with a BMI ≤30 kg/m 2.Those with a BMI ≥30 kg/m 2 are recommended to gain less weight during pregnancy than patients with lower BMIs. The IoM suggests a gain of 5–9 kg during a singleton pregnancy in women with obesity, however, does not differentiate by obesity class.Subsequent studies suggest (figure 1) that those with a preconception BMI of:

Q16 Should neurovascular stenting be used in patients with IIH with headache alone?

The literature detailing stenting typically does not clearly separate the cohorts of IIH into those with visual loss, those with headaches alone and those with both. They typically also do not separate those with acute IIH, those with chronic IIH and those with IIH in ocular remission. Another major limitation is that case series are non-randomised; typically, they do not detail morphological stenosis type; they tend to be small in size with selection bias, and there is a lack of long-term follow-up.
Neurovascular stenting is not currently a treatment for headache in IIH.

Uncertainty

Patients with IIH often develop migrainous headaches superimposed on the headaches secondary to raised intracranial pressure. While CSF diversion procedures have not been shown to be effective for the management of headaches, this may be attributable to the migrainous component not being optimally addressed. Conversely, failure to optimise the ICP (with a CSF diversion procedures) may render the migrainous headache difficult to treat. CSF diversion procedures for the management of headaches should only be carried out in a multidisciplinary setting and following a period of intracranial pressure monitoring.

Management of headaches in the shunted patient with IIH

Shunted patients with IIH may have significant headache morbidity, and shunt failures and overdrainage should always be considered. Understanding the underlying causes may guide management. Shunt revision should not routinely be undertaken unless there is papilloedema and a risk of visual deterioration. Many of these patients may be in ocular remission, as with chronic IIH headaches, conservative management with migraine therapies and treatment of medication overuse should be tried initially. Patients may need assessment by a experienced clinician who routinely manage headache. Medication refractory patients should be managed in a specialist headache service and discussed within a multidisciplinary setting for consideration of ICP monitoring.

### Managing idiopathic intracranial hypertension in pregnancy: practical advice [^4325b868]. Practical Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Pregnancy in IIH requires additional considerations. Ideally women should achieve disease remission or stabilisation before pregnancy. Drugs including acetazolamide and topiramate have teratogenic risks and we avoid these during pregnancy. An important aspect is the risk of weight gain during pregnancy, as this can exacerbate IIH. There are useful guidelines on weight gain targets in pregnancy for those with obesity; these should be actively discussed with the patient and supported. We recommend increased frequency of IIH outpatient reviews during pregnancy to identify any clinical deterioration early and provide reassurance.

It is now well recognized that idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) can occur in children. Relative to the adult population, the demographic features and clinical presentation of IIH as well as the diagnosis and treatment guidelines for children are quite different. Although these differences are well established, specific diagnostic and treatment guidelines for pediatric patients have largely been based on the adult literature. Exciting new evidence is now available to assist the clinician in managing pediatric patients with IIH.

Q9 How should acetazolamide be prescribed?

The IIHTT used a maximal dose of 4 g daily, with 44% of participants achieving 4 g/day, and the majority tolerating 1 g/day.Ball et al identified that 48% discontinued at mean doses of 1.5 g due to side effects.
A popular starting dose of acetazolamide is 250–500 mg twice a day, with the majority of clinicians titrating the daily dose up.
Patients should be warned of the adverse side effects of acetazolamide that are well recognised and include increased risk of diarrhoea, dysgeusia, fatigue, nausea, paraesthesia, tinnitus, vomiting, depression and rarely renal stones.
There is no consensus over the use of normal release and modified release acetazolamide.

Uncertainties

The optimal dose of acetazolamide is not established. The licencing information regarding acetazolamide recommends periodic monitoring of serum electrolytes; however, there is no consensus on the timing of monitoring.

Q10 Are there other drugs that are helpful in IIH?

Topiramate has carbonic anhydrase activity and can suppress appetite. It has been compared with acetazolamide in an uncontrolled open label study for IIH.Participants were alternately assigned to the treatments, not randomly, and there was no placebo control group. There is evidence of efficacy of topiramate in treating migraine.
There may be a role for topiramate in IIH with weekly dose escalation from 25 mg to 50 mg bd.
Where topiramate is prescribed, women must be informed that it can reduce the efficacy of the contraceptive pill/oral contraceptives and other hormonal contraceptives.
When topiramate is prescribed, women must be counselled regarding side effects (including depression and cognitive slowing) and potential teratogenetic risks.

Uncertainties

The role of other diuretics such as furosemide, amiloride and coamilofruse are not certain but are used by some as alternative therapies.

Third principle of IIH management: reduce headache disability

Raised ICP can drive headaches, which may be very severe at presentation.Despite significant headache morbidity in IIH, there are no randomised controlled trials to guide headache management in IIH.

### Idiopathic intracranial hypertension ; research progress and emerging themes [^e4f5785c]. Journal of Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is a condition characterised by increased intracranial pressure of unknown cause predominantly seen in obese women of childbearing age and associated with a history of recent weight gain. The aetiology is poorly understood and there are no evidence-based guidelines on the management of the disease. We aim to provide a review of the recent literature outlining the latest advances in this field over the past few years. Areas of emerging interest related to the pathophysiology of IIH will be discussed, such as the role of obesity, adipose tissue and 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1. We consider the latest research on the role of venous sinus stenosis in IIH and ex vivo advances into cerebrospinal fluid drainage via the arachnoid granulation tissue. The latest techniques for optic nerve head evaluation and the role of optical coherence tomography will be summarised. Finally, we will discuss recent advances in the management of IIH, including weight loss, and medical and surgical treatment strategies.

### Weight management communications in idiopathic intracranial hypertension: challenges and recommendations from the patients' perspective [^c83f597d]. BMJ Neurology Open (2023). High credibility.

Discussion

This study provides novel insights into the experiences of PwIIH regarding their current, mostly negative, interactions with HCPs about body weight and weight management. It offers suggestions from PwIIH on how the communication of weight management could be improved in the context of IIH disease management. Despite significant evidence demonstrating that weight loss is an effective treatment for IIHwe found that only a fifth of PwIIH recalled being offered support for weight management and only 16% of PwIIH found the support to be ‘helpful and appropriate’. This evidence demonstrates an unmet clinical need to provide training and support in regard to approaching weight management conversations and onward referrals to weight management service, where appropriate, for HCPs who care for PwIIH.

PwIIH expressed that it was important to them that the HCP should first ask their permission to discuss weight. However, less than 1 in 10 (7%) of PwIIH in our study recalled being asked for permission first. Asking questions, rather than issuing statements, is a core principle of motivational interviewing which has been shown to facilitate patient-driven behaviour changeand is recommended in fields such as pain neuroscience to enhance a patient’s receptiveness to advice and education.

### Managing idiopathic intracranial hypertension in pregnancy: practical advice [^2eaf2c78]. Practical Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is more common in women of reproductive age who have obesity, yet there is little information on its management specifically in pregnancy. Women with IIH should plan their pregnancy including discussing contraception before pregnancy, recognising that hormonal contraceptives are not contraindicated. Potentially teratogenic medications including acetazolamide and topiramate are not recommended during pregnancy or in those with immediate plans to conceive; prescribing acetazolamide in pregnancy must only follow discussion with the patient and their obstetrician. Ideally, patients should aim to achieve disease remission or control before pregnancy, through optimising their weight. Although weight gain is expected in pregnancy, excessive weight gain may exacerbate IIH and increase maternal and fetal complications; evidence-based recommendations for non-IIH pregnancies may help in guiding optimal gestational weight gain. The vast majority of women with IIH can have a normal vaginal delivery, with spinal or epidural anaesthesia if needed, provided the papilloedema is stable or the IIH is in remission.

### Baseline clinical profiles in the IIHTT (...) [^85abfdc1]. JAMA Network (2014). Excellent credibility.

Design, Setting, and Participants We collected data at baseline from questionnaires, examinations, automated perimetry, and fundus photography grading. Patients were enrolled from March 17, 2010, to November 27, 2012, at 38 academic and private practice sites in North America. All participants met the modified Dandy criteria for IIH and had a perimetric mean deviation between −2 dB and −7 dB. All but 4 participants were women. Main Outcomes and Measures Baseline and laboratory characteristics. Results The mean age of our patients was 29. 0 years and 4 were men. The average body mass index was 39.
9. Headache was the most common symptom. Conclusions and Relevance The Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension Treatment Trial represents the largest prospectively analyzed cohort of untreated patients with IIH.

Our data show that IIH is almost exclusively a disease of obese young women. Patients with IIH with mild visual loss have typical symptoms, may have mild acuity loss, and have visual field defects, with predominantly arcuate loss and enlarged blind spots that require formal perimetry for detection. Trial Registration clinicaltrials. gov Identifier: NCT01003639 Idiopathic intracranial hypertension is a syndrome characterized by increased intracranial pressure, with its associated signs and symptoms, in an alert and oriented patient. Neuroimaging is normal except for findings known to occur with chronic increased intracranial pressure of any cause. Lumbar puncture and cerebrospinal fluid analysis findings were normal except for increased intracranial pressure. In addition, no secondary cause of intracranial hypertension is apparent.
1.

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension occurs with a frequency of about 1 case per 100 000 population per year or
19. 3 per 100 000 in obese women aged 20 to 44 years, 2 and its incidence has increased in concert with the obesity epidemic. Loss of sensory visual function, occurring in most patients, 3 is the only major morbidity associated with IIH. Because about 10% of patients develop bilateral blindness, 3, 4 having evidence-based treatment strategies is important. Using all available clinical information, an adjudication committee needed to decide whether the worsening was most likely due to uncontrolled intracranial pressure and progression of IIH. Patients who experienced treatment failure were withdrawn from further participation in the trial. Outcome variables were assessed at baseline and at follow-up visits, with end-of-study assessments being of primary interest.

The primary outcome variable was the change from baseline to 6 months in the PMD of the eye with the worst PMD at baseline. The papilledema grade 8, 9 was documented at each visit by the site investigator and by the Photographic Reading Center for photographs centered on the optic disc focused at the retinal plane, on the plane of highest disc elevation, and in the papillomacular area. Height, weight, and waist circumference were measured at each study visit. Further details regarding the methods of the trial are provided in a separate article.
14. Pulse synchronous tinnitus occurred in 52% of patients; it was bilateral in two-thirds of cases and unilateral in one-third. It occurred an average of 16. 7 days per month, ranging from once monthly to daily. Tinnitus that was nonpulsatile was present in 23%; in one-third of these patients, the tinnitus occurred daily. Back pain, including pain in a radicular pattern, occurred in 53%.

### Managing idiopathic intracranial hypertension in the eye clinic [^808b6ffd]. Eye (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

IIH is a complex condition with different degrees of compromise of visual function and headaches that can be debilitating. In this opinion piece we have not fully discussed weight management, headache therapies, the mental health burden or the maternal health concerns : all of which need to be addressed in a person living with IIH. We have focused on an article for ophthalmologists, where the eye examination determines management. The more severely compromised the visual function, the faster and more aggressively we need to act. Overall, the investigation and management of IIH is a team effort including ophthalmologists, neurologists, neurosurgeons and weight management experts. More patients with IIH will be attending clinic, as the increase in prevalence and incidence is evident. Fortunately, there is new research in this area, with the potential for targeted therapies.

### Evolving evidence in adult idiopathic intracranial hypertension: pathophysiology and management [^fb04ae7b]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is characterised by raised intracranial pressure (ICP) of unknown cause, when all other causes of raised ICP have been excluded.IIH causes significant morbidity, including permanent visual loss in up to 25% of caseswith reports of 1–2% of new cases being registered blind per yearand disabling headache in the majority.With peak presentation being between ages 20 and 40 years; an overwhelming female predominance and a strong association with obesity; IIH, is well known as a disorder that affects overweight women of reproductive age.

There are a number of indicators that incidence and prevalence of IIH are rising, likely related to increasing prevalence of obesity worldwide; WHO indicates a twofold increase in the UK between 1997 and 2002 and a threefold increase in the USA between 1990 and 2006. A recent epidemiology study reported an incidence of IIH occurring in 28/100 000/year,which is the highest reported rate in the literature so far.In the USA, there was a 320% increase in new cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) shunt procedures for IIH between 1998 and 2002.IIH is an expensive condition for society and the individual: in the USA, total economic costs are estimated at greater than US$444 million per annum, and 57% of patients report significant lost earnings with 31% changing occupation.

The aetiology and pathology are not fully established, and the disorder has become the subject of increasing scientific scrutiny over the last decade. With no single cause implicated, uncertainties surround the best therapeutics which have led to differing management strategies. Both adults and children can be affected by IIH, however, paediatric IIH may have different pathogenesis and clinical courseand is not discussed in this article. In this review, we review adult onset IIH with focus on the latest developments in both the pathogenic mechanisms and management.

### Magnetic resonance imaging signs of idiopathic intracranial hypertension (...) [^22af2c4a]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Findings In this cohort study of 192 patients, the presence of 2 of 3 IIH-specific MRI signs enabled the diagnosis of papilledema in patients with suspected IIH with greater accuracy than with the use of current diagnostic MRI criteria. This diagnostic ability was confirmed in 3 independent cohorts. Exposure Standardized diagnostic workup was performed to classify cases according to current criteria, and blinded evaluation of cerebral radiological diagnostics and papilledema was performed. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcomes were MRI signs associated with IIH as assessed by univariate analyses. An MRI score estimating papilledema was calculated using machine learning. Internal validation of associations with lumbar puncture opening pressure and outcome and external validation of accuracy were performed in 3 cohorts. Results Of 192 eligible patients, 110 were classified as having IIH, 4 as having probable IIH, and 1 as having suspected IIH without papilledema; 77 did not have IIH and served as controls, with corresponding age, sex, and weight. The papilledema-estimating MRI score showed optimal balance between sensitivity and specificity when 2 of the 3 latter signs were present and was associated with the lumbar puncture opening pressure and ophthalmological outcome. The score showed strong diagnostic accuracy in the external validation cohorts and outperformed the current diagnostic MRI criteria.

Conclusions and Relevance The findings of this cohort study of patients with IIH and controls suggest that an evidence-based MRI score including posterior globe flattening, optic nerve disc protrusion, and transverse sinus stenosis can estimate the presence of papilledema more accurately than the current diagnostic criteria. Idiopathic intracranial hypertension is characterized by elevated intracranial pressure of unknown cause, resulting in typical symptoms such as headache and impairment of the optic nerve due to papilledema. abducens nerve palsy, normal magnetic resonance imaging brain parenchymal and cerebral venography findings, normal cerebrospinal fluid composition, elevated lumbar puncture opening pressure, and papilledema. Three specific senior consultants with experience in the diagnosis of papilledema and pseudopapilledema in the headache centers’ ophthalmology departments conducted all ophthalmological assessments, as described elsewhere. 9 All unilateral and bilateral visual field defects, including reduced sensitivity, enlarged blind spots, and optic nerve atrophy, were defined as long-term ophthalmological sequelae. The binary outcome was papilledema.

### An interdisciplinary integrated specialized one-stop outpatient clinic for idiopathic intracranial hypertension-a comprehensive assessment of clinical outcome [^f8f05995]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background and purpose

Management of idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is complex requiring multiple specialized disciplines. In practice, this creates considerable organizational and communicational challenges for healthcare professionals and patients. Thus, an interdisciplinary integrated outpatient clinic for IIH (comprising neurology, neuroophthalmology, neuroradiology, neurosurgery and endocrinology) was established with central coordination and a one‐stop concept. Here, the aim was to evaluate the effects of this one‐stop concept on objective clinical outcome.

Methods

In a retrospective cohort study, the one‐stop era with integrated care (IC) (1 July 2021 to 31 December 2022) was compared to a reference group receiving standard care (SC) (1 July 2018 to 31 December 2019) regarding visual impairment/worsening and headache improvement/freedom 6 months after diagnosis. Multivariate binary logistic regression models were used to adjust for confounders.

Results

Baseline characteristics of the IC group (n = 85) and SC group (n = 81) were comparable (female 90.6% vs. 90.1%; mean age 33.6 vs. 32.8 years; median body mass index 31.8 vs. 33.0; median cerebrospinal fluid opening pressure 32 vs. 34 cmH 2 O; at diagnosis, visual impairment was present in 71.8% vs. 69.1% and chronic headache in 55.3% vs. 56.8% in IC vs. SC). IC was associated with a higher likelihood of achieving both headache improvement (odds ratio [OR] 2.24, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.52–4.33, p < 0.001) and headache freedom (OR 1.75, 95% CI 1.11–3.09, p = 0.031). Regarding the risk of visual impairment and visual worsening IC was superior numerically but not statistically significantly (OR 0.87, 95% CI 0.69–1.16, p = 0.231, and OR 0.67, 95% CI 0.41–1.25, p = 0.354).

Conclusions

Interdisciplinary integrated care of IIH is favourably associated with headache outcomes and potentially also visual outcomes.

### Diagnostic process, misdiagnosis and bias in suspected idiopathic intracranial hypertension: a retrospective observational cohort study [^f7d71282]. BMJ Neurology Open (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is an unsolved conundrum of elevated intracranial pressure (ICP). Despite a tremendous increase in prevalence,the disease remains uncommon, with the most recent Western prevalence ranging from 4.7/100 000to 76/100 000.The patient phenotype is remarkably homogeneous: predominantly females of fertile age with obesity—the latter termed a current pandemic. IIH is a great mimicker of primary headache disorders,which are common too. Neuro-ophthalmologists report ‘flooding’ with ‘rule-out’ referrals of suspected IIHof which only a minority has it. False-positive misdiagnosis of IIH is prevalentinflicting unnecessary invasive procedures, off-label medication with heavy side effects and postponed true diagnosis. False-negative misdiagnosis may cause irreversible visual impairment.

Historically, IIH has been a diagnosis of exclusion, hence the term ' idiopathic ', with diagnostic criteria characterised by negative findings (normal neurological examination, neuroimaging and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) content). Diagnostic criteria have moved towards more positive findings (papilloedema, opening pressure (OP) ≥25 cm CSF, neuroimaging indicating elevated ICP and abducens palsy).Unfortunately, interpretation of the optic disc can be difficult even for experienced ophthalmologists, OP is subject to various sources of error, and no consensus exists on quantitative measures of abnormality regarding neuroimaging indicating IIH. This leaves clinicians with a limited toolbox in the diagnostic process, particularly non-specialists, and several cognitive biases have been observed in the diagnostic process of IIH.

In 2018, two international guidelines on the management of IIH were independently published.These guide management once the diagnosis is settled, but the oftentimes cumbersome and faulty process preceding diagnosiscalls for evidence-based guidance. The first National Guideline (NG) of IIH management in Denmark was published in May 2021.A key aim was to direct a uniform multidisciplinary strategy with clear organisation and timely diagnostic workup (DWU). After recommending that all patients with suspected IIH should be referred to tertiary care the annual referral rate to the Danish Headache Center (DHC) doubled.It has recently been shown that a specialised multidisciplinary approach at tertiary level improves patient outcomes,satisfaction,and health economic and societal costs.Whether it improves the diagnostic process is yet unclear.

Q5 What other surgical procedures are performed for visual loss in IIH?

ONSF is performed more frequently in Europe and the USA and rarely in the UK. ONSF is reported to have less complications than CSF diversion, and there have been no reports of mortalities in the literature. The reported temporary adverse effects include double vision, ansiocoria and optic nerve head haemorrhages. Very rarely more permanent sequelae that include branch and central retinal artery occlusions have been reported. Some consider ONSF as the first treatment step in malignant fulminant cases and eventually also for those with asymmetric papilloedema causing visual loss in one eye.If this procedure fails, then the more invasive CSF diversion can be considered. ONSF should be performed by an experienced clinician trained in this technique.

Uncertainty

The literature is observational and mainly case series based.Treatment failure rates include worsening in vision after a period of stabilisation in 34% of patients at 1 year and 45% at 3 years. There is also failure to improve headache in one third to one-half.

Q6 What is the current role of neurovascular stenting in acute IIH to prevent loss of vision?

Improvements in venography imaging now detail that many with IIH have anatomical abnormalities of the cerebral venous sinus system. These include stenosis of the dominant or both transverse sinus. The stenosis may result from intrinsic dural sinus anatomy or extrinsic compression by the increased intracranial pressure and reducing ICP can led to resolution of stenosis. The degree of stenosis does not appear to uniformly correlate with intracranial pressure or visual loss.Neurovascular stenting has been reported, in a number of series, to lead to an improvement in symptoms of intracranial hypertension. Complications of the procedure include a short-lived ipsilateral headache in many, stent-adjacent stenosis that require retreatment in a third and in rare cases vessel perforation leading to acute subdural haematoma, stent migration and thrombosis.
The role of neurovascular stenting in IIH is not yet established.
Long-term antithrombotic therapy is required for longer than 6 months following neurovascular stenting treatment.

Uncertainty

The literature is observational and mainly case series based, and there is no long-term data regarding efficacy and safety. The role of neurovascular stenting in IIH to preserve rapidly deteriorating vision is not yet established, as there is a lack of quality data in this area. It may be useful for highly selected patients with IIH with venous sinus stenosis with an elevated pressure gradient and elevated ICP in whom traditional therapies have not worked.

### Effectiveness of bariatric surgery vs community weight management intervention for the treatment of idiopathic intracranial hypertension: a randomized clinical trial [^b1f90acb]. JAMA Neurology (2021). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Is bariatric surgery superior to a community weight management intervention in sustaining the weight loss necessary to achieve sustained remission among patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension?

Findings

In this randomized clinical trial of 66 women with idiopathic intracranial hypertension and a body mass index of 35 or higher, bariatric surgery was superior to a community weight management intervention in decreasing intracranial pressure, with continued improvement at 2 years.

Meaning

The study’s findings indicate that, among women with idiopathic intracranial hypertension and a body mass index of 35 or higher, bariatric surgery is an effective treatment to reduce intracranial pressure and for sustained disease remission.

### Weight management communications in idiopathic intracranial hypertension: challenges and recommendations from the patients' perspective [^6d76e291]. BMJ Neurology Open (2023). High credibility.

Background

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is a neurometabolic condition severely impacting the quality of life of people living with IIH (PwIIH). Most PwIIH are overweight or live with obesity, and weight loss is recommended by healthcare professionals (HCPs) as it is central to disease management. There is currently no research evaluating patient–clinician interactions when discussing weight management in IIH. The aim of this study was to evaluate the patient experience of communication with HCPs regarding weight management from the perspective of PwIIH.

Methods

A cross-sectional online survey was developed and distributed by the IIH UK charity via their mailing list and social media network. Eligible participants were adults with IIH who have been recommended to lose weight by their HCP. Descriptive statistics were used to summarise quantitative responses and content analysis was used to inductively draw out themes from open-ended free-text responses.

Results

There were 625 respondents. One-fifth of PwIIH (n=127/603, 21%) felt that HCPs were supportive and empathetic about weight management. Five themes were identified on how experiences regarding weight management for IIH can be improved, with PwIIH recommending for HCPs to: (1) detail the relationship between IIH and weight, (2) individualise care, (3) give advice, (4) provide support and (5) adapt communication.

Conclusion

The majority of PwIIH recalled a poor experience and negative emotions when engaged in discussions regarding weight management with their HCPs. Further research should explore the HCPs perspective and evaluate interventions aiming to improve the quality of patient–HCPs communication in IIH.

IC was associated with a higher likelihood of achieving both headache improvement (odds ratio [OR] 2.24, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.52-4.33, p<0.001) and headache freedom (OR 1.75, 95% CI 1.11-3.09, p=0.031). Regarding the risk of visual impairment and visual worsening IC was superior numerically but not statistically significantly (OR 0.87, 95% CI 0.69-1.16, p=0.231, and OR 0.67, 95% CI 0.41-1.25, p=0.354).

Conclusions

Interdisciplinary integrated care of IIH is favourably associated with headache outcomes and potentially also visual outcomes.

### Interventions for idiopathic intracranial hypertension [^4f0566f0]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) occurs throughout the world with an estimated incidence of one to three per 100,000 population per year. It occurs most commonly in obese young women, but the cause is unknown. It presents a significant threat to sight and is associated with severe morbidity in the form of headaches in the majority of cases. Several different treatments have been proposed, ranging from relatively conservative measures such as diuretic therapy to more invasive treatments such as optic nerve sheath fenestration or lumbo-peritoneal shunting.

Objectives

The aim of this review is to assess the evidence from controlled trials looking at the various treatments used for idiopathic intracranial hypertension with a view to producing an evidence-based treatment strategy.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register - CENTRAL/CCTR (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group specialised register) on the Cochrane Library Issue 2, 2002, MEDLINE (1966 to March 2002) and EMBASE (1980 to February 2002).

Selection Criteria

We included only randomised controlled trials in which any intervention used to treat idiopathic intracranial hypertension had been compared to placebo or to another form of treatment in people with a clinical diagnosis of idiopathic intracranial hypertension.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers independently assessed the search results for trials to be included in the review. Discrepancies were resolved by discussion. Since no trials met our inclusion criteria, no assessment of quality or meta-analysis was undertaken.

Main Results

No randomised controlled trials were found that met the inclusion criteria.

Reviewer's Conclusions

There is insufficient information to generate an evidence-based management strategy for idiopathic intracranial hypertension. Of the various treatments available, there is inadequate information regarding which are truly beneficial and which are potentially harmful. Properly designed and executed trials are needed.

### Weight management interventions for adults with idiopathic intracranial hypertension: a systematic review and practice recommendations [^7284f50b]. Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The recommendation to treat overweight and obesity in people living with IIH is not only because weight loss reduces ICP but also that it reduces mortalityand reduces the burden of prevalent and incident obesity-related complications.Weight loss is recognized as a modifiable factor in the treatment of IIH. This study sought to determine the optimal weight loss intervention for IIH, which was identified as research priority by the James Lind Alliance Priority Setting Partnership.The panel made graded recommendations based on the evidence identified by this systematic review and detailed clinical guidance in GPPs from the obesity literature (Table 5).

Although there was 1 RCT demonstrating Level 1++ evidence for the directed use of bariatric surgery with sustained weight loss and reduction in ICP to 24 monthsand 1 cross-over study (Level 2+) using a VLED for 3 months, which demonstrated efficacy for ICP, visual, and headache outcomes, these 2 studies have not been replicated. The results of this analysis therefore demonstrated the shortage of high-quality evidence because there were no studies that could be directly compared due to different weight management methods being used and a lack of standardized outcome measures.

Regarding diagnostic procedures for idiopathic intracranial hypertension, more specifically with respect to diagnostic lumbar puncture, ABN/BASH/RCOphth/SBNS 2018 guidelines recommend to balance the length of the procedure by the comfort of the individual patient if difficulty exists in performing the lumbar puncture.

Sustained long-term weight loss should be considered as a tool to improve the health and quality of life of patients with IIH. Patients with IIH with overweight or obesity should be counseled sensitively about the role of obesity and weight management in IIH. They should have their weight measured and BMI calculated to assess the weight management options and monitor the intervention efficacy. Although there are no RCTs that evaluated the measurement of overweight and obesity compared with not measuring these outcomes, the panel agreed that this aspect of IIH patient care was essential.

The degree of weight loss required for IIH symptom improvement was less clear as studies reported the amount of weight lost with a variety of outcome measures. There were no studies evaluating the time where the minimum amount of weight lost was correlated with the point of disease remission. Level 2+ evidence demonstrated that a reduction of weight between 15% and 24% was required to achieve disease remission. In the VLED cross-over study, 15% of body weight loss was correlated with reduction in ICP, resolution of papilledema, and favorable headache outcomes,and the IIHWT disease remission was defined as ICP to return to normal levels at 25 cm H 2 O.It is therefore important to acknowledge that while some lifestyle interventions delivered in the community setting may be effective for weight loss,they may not deliver the magnitude of weight loss required to induce remission of IIH. The panel considered this evidence and recommended the target weight loss should be 15% for IIH disease remission. However, the panel acknowledged that this goal is unlikely to be achieved through a lifestyle intervention alone, and a realistic goal may be 5%–10% weight loss,which may still offer some improvement in IIH symptoms.

### Metamorphopsia as an initial complaint of idiopathic intracranial hypertension (...) [^da49ff09]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Customize your JAMA Network experience by selecting one or more topics from the list below. W. RICHARDGREENMD. Its cause is unknown, but recent weight gain is nearly universal. Symptoms include headache, pulse-synchronous tinnitus, visual obscurations, and diplopia. Most patients have papilledema, and they may have sixth nerve palsies. Optic nerve dysfunction can occur if the papilledema is severe or prolonged. Report of Cases. She noted “twinkling lights” in her vision on waking. She denied headaches, except for those associated with sinus problems. She weighed 106 kg, was 168 cm tall, and had gained 14 kg during the preceding 4 years. Her visual acuity was 20/15 OU. She described distortion of the Amsler grid temporally in the right eye. Automated perimetry showed enlargement of the physiologic blind spot in the right eye. She had Frisen stage 2 papilledema in the right eye1 and stage 1 papilledema in the left eye. There were no abnormalities of the maculae.

A fluorescein angiogram showed no abnormalities except for late staining of both optic nerves. Magnetic resonance imaging results were normal, and lumbar puncture showed an opening pressure of 280 mm CSF, with normal indices. Treatment with acetazolamide resulted in improvement of the twinkling lights and gradual regression of the papilledema. The metamorphopsia improved slightly. Fundus photographs at initial examination. A, Case 1 showing stage 2 papilledema in the right eye and stage 1 papilledema in the left eye. B, Case 2 showing stage 2 papilledema in the right eye and stage 0 papilledema in the left eye. C, Case 3 showing stage 2 papilledema in both eyes. D, Case 4 showing stage 2 papilledema in both eyes. Case 2. This 43-year-old woman had had metamorphopsia in the right eye for 4 months. Her medical history was unremarkable. Her ophthalmic history was notable for myopia and contact lens wear.

She weighed 63 kg, was 152 cm tall, and had gained 7 to 9 kg during the past year. Best-corrected visual acuity was 20/20 OD and 20/15 OS. She described distortion of the Amsler grid in the right eye. Her examination findings were normal except for stage 2 papilledema in the right eye and mild relative enlargement of the blind spot on automated perimetry in the right eye. There were tiny macular drusen in the right eye. A fluorescein angiogram showed only late hyperfluorescence of both optic nerves. The MRI results were normal except for a slightly tortuous optic nerve sheath in the right eye without enhancement and an empty sella. She developed transient tunneling of vision in the mornings, and on follow-up she had developed a new peripapillary hemorrhage with stage 3 papilledema in the right eye and stage 1 papilledema in the left eye. Lumbar puncture showed an opening pressure of 275 mm CSF, with normal indices.

Treatment with acetazolamide resulted in resolution of the tunneling and improvement of the papilledema to stage 1 in the right eye and stage 0 in the left eye but no change in the metamorphopsia. Results of ocular coherence tomography of the macula were normal. A multifocal electroretinogram showed no focal abnormality corresponding to her metamorphopsia. Case 3. This 48-year-old woman had had distortion of her vision bilaterally for 6 to 12 months. Her medical history was notable for asthma and hypercholesterolemia. Review of systems was notable for non–pulse-synchronous tinnitus and rare headaches. Her ophthalmic history was notable for myopia. She weighed 106 kg, was 157 cm tall, and had lost 7 kg in the past few months. On examination, her visual acuity was 20/20 OD and 20/25 OS, with distortion on the Amsler grid bilaterally. Examination findings were normal except for stage 2 papilledema in both eyes.
