## Question

Can vraylar be used for ￼ postpartum psychosis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether Vraylar (cariprazine) can be used for postpartum psychosis and how to reason through that decision. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical entity of postpartum psychosis and its standard-of-care treatment. Then, I should verify cariprazine's FDA-labeled indications and whether postpartum psychosis is included. Next, I will review perinatal safety data for cariprazine, including pregnancy, lactation, and neonatal exposure. After that, I need to check for any direct evidence of cariprazine in postpartum psychosis. Then, I will compare cariprazine's pharmacologic profile with agents that have stronger evidence in PPP. Finally, I should synthesize a risk–benefit recommendation and outline practical alternatives and monitoring if cariprazine is considered off-label, including drug–drug interactions and breastfeeding considerations.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and standard of care for postpartum psychosis, because I need to ensure I'm anchoring on the right treatment framework. Postpartum psychosis is a psychiatric emergency with rapid onset after childbirth, high risks of suicide and infanticide, and a strong link to bipolar spectrum vulnerability; management typically requires inpatient care, benzodiazepines for agitation and sleep, antipsychotics for psychosis, and lithium for both acute stabilization and relapse prevention, with ECT reserved for severe, treatment-resistant, or life-threatening presentations [^113cN3es] [^115orjhQ] [^116SfwWN].

> Wait, let me verify the regulatory status before drawing conclusions. Cariprazine is FDA-approved for schizophrenia and for manic/mixed and depressive episodes in bipolar I disorder; it is not approved for postpartum psychosis, so any use in PPP would be off-label and would need to be justified by clinical rationale and available safety/efficacy data, which I should double-check in the label and contemporary guidelines [^116RbBEb] [^113PwVNB].

> I need to check perinatal safety next, because even if efficacy is plausible, maternal and infant safety will drive the decision. The FDA label notes that cariprazine may cause fetal harm based on animal data, with malformations and developmental delays in rats at exposures near or below the MRHD, and it warns about third-trimester exposure risks of neonatal EPS/withdrawal; importantly, the active metabolite DDCAR persists up to 12 weeks after discontinuation, complicating peripartum management and lactation planning [^112PNHdh] [^112HeWcW]. Hold on, I should verify lactation data specifically; the label states lactation studies have not been conducted in humans, cariprazine is present in rat milk, and there are no human data on infant exposure or effects, which leaves a significant evidence gap for breastfeeding safety [^112HeWcW].

> Next, I should review whether there is any direct evidence for cariprazine in postpartum psychosis. I will now examine the provided sources for trials, case series, or case reports; I find no randomized trials, prospective cohorts, or published case reports of cariprazine for PPP, and no guideline endorses its use in PPP, which means the evidence base is essentially absent for this indication [^notfound]. Hmm, wait a minute, could I have missed a case report elsewhere? I should confirm again that among the cited materials, nothing addresses cariprazine in PPP, reinforcing that we lack supportive data for off-label use here [^notfound].

> Let me consider pharmacologic plausibility, but I need to be careful not to over-extrapolate. Cariprazine's partial agonism at D2/D3 with 5-HT1A partial agonism and 5-HT2A antagonism could theoretically treat mania/psychosis, and it has evidence in bipolar I depression and mania; however, PPP often behaves like a bipolar-spectrum mania/psychosis with unique perinatal physiology, and the absence of PPP-specific data plus the long persistence of active metabolites makes mechanistic plausibility insufficient to override safety concerns in the immediate postpartum window [^112rtPY9] [^116RbBEb] [^111hPCP7] [^113cN3es] [^112PNHdh]. Hold on, I should verify that the D3-predominant profile hasn't been shown to mitigate postpartum-specific risks; there's no such evidence presented here, so I shouldn't infer advantage where none is documented [^notfound].

> I should confirm comparative options with stronger evidence so I can frame a practical recommendation. Agents with relatively robust perinatal data and PPP-relevant evidence include olanzapine and quetiapine for acute treatment and breastfeeding compatibility, and lithium for both acute stabilization and relapse prevention; ECT remains a high-efficacy option for severe or treatment-resistant cases, with good maternal response and no clear infant harm from breastfeeding during ECT [^115orjhQ] [^114jWAug] [^116Rck7q]. Let me double-check the strength of lithium's evidence; prospective data show very high remission rates when lithium is added and strong relapse prevention in PPP, which strengthens its role as first-line maintenance when feasible [^114AVoxx] [^112MsYwc].

> But wait, what if breastfeeding is a priority and cariprazine's lack of lactation data is the stumbling block? I should confirm which antipsychotics have better breastfeeding safety profiles. Guidelines and reviews consistently favor olanzapine and quetiapine for lower relative infant dose and more reassuring infant monitoring data, whereas cariprazine's human lactation safety is unknown and its long-lived metabolites complicate risk assessment during nursing [^111hxpq5] [^111E4z4F] [^112HeWcW]. I need to ensure we also discuss sleep hygiene and potential risks of sleep deprivation with breastfeeding in women with PPP, as sleep loss can destabilize mood and psychosis, which may influence feeding plans in some cases [^115orjhQ] [^113spB2W].

> I should also review drug–drug interactions and special populations before concluding. Cariprazine is metabolized by CYP3A4, and strong CYP3A4 inhibitors like ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitors require dose reductions to as low as 1.5 mg every other day in some scenarios, which could complicate acute inpatient titration and efficacy; this is a practical limitation if complex medical comorbidity or antiretroviral therapy is present [^111muWTC] [^114JBrDa]. Hold on, I should verify renal/hepatic caveats too; severe renal or hepatic impairment is not recommended for cariprazine, which may be relevant in select postpartum patients with organ dysfunction, further constraining its use compared with alternatives [^112MDAJC].

> Let me reconsider the core question and synthesize. Can cariprazine be used for postpartum psychosis? Off-label, yes, legally and clinically it can be considered, but given absent PPP-specific efficacy data, concerning animal reproductive findings, prolonged active metabolite persistence, and no human lactation safety data, cariprazine should not be a first- or second-line agent for PPP. Instead, prioritize agents with established perinatal efficacy and safety profiles such as lithium, olanzapine, or quetiapine, and reserve ECT for severe or refractory presentations, while documenting the rationale and consent if cariprazine is contemplated as a last-resort alternative after failure or intolerance of preferred options [^113PwVNB] [^112PNHdh] [^112HeWcW] [^115orjhQ] [^114AVoxx].

> Final recommendation and safety plan: If cariprazine is used off-label in PPP, I should confirm inpatient monitoring, use the lowest effective dose with slow titration, avoid breastfeeding due to unknown infant exposure, coordinate obstetric–pediatric follow-up, and consider the prolonged washout when planning subsequent pregnancies. I should also register the exposure with the National Pregnancy Registry for Atypical Antipsychotics to contribute to safety data and counsel the patient explicitly about uncertain risks and the rationale for choosing a nonpreferred agent [^112PNHdh] [^112HeWcW] [^115orjhQ]. Hold on, I should verify one more thing: there is no mention here of cariprazine being included in perinatal treatment algorithms, which reinforces that its role remains investigational at best for PPP pending dedicated studies [^notfound].

Vraylar (cariprazine) is not FDA-approved for postpartum psychosis, but may be used off-label when first-line treatments (lithium, olanzapine, quetiapine, ECT) are ineffective or contraindicated. There is **no direct evidence** on cariprazine in postpartum psychosis, and its lactation safety is unknown; therefore, it should be avoided in breastfeeding mothers. If used, it requires careful risk–benefit assessment, close monitoring, and coordination with maternal–infant specialists [^1116uVFF] [^113tvKnD] [^112HeWcW] [^115orjhQ] [^113tJY8q].

---

## Clinical evidence and guidelines

- **FDA approval**: Cariprazine is approved for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, but not for postpartum psychosis.

- **Guideline support**: No major guidelines (ACOG, NICE, BAP) recommend cariprazine for postpartum psychosis; first-line treatments are lithium, olanzapine, quetiapine, and ECT [^113tvKnD].

- **Direct evidence**: There are no published studies or case reports on cariprazine for postpartum psychosis.

---

## Pharmacological considerations

Cariprazine is a **partial agonist** at dopamine D2/D3 and serotonin 5-HT1A receptors and an antagonist at 5-HT2A receptors, supporting antipsychotic and mood-stabilizing effects. Its long half-life and active metabolites result in slow clearance, which may complicate perinatal management and breastfeeding.

---

## Safety considerations in postpartum patients

- **Lactation**: Human data are lacking; cariprazine is present in rat milk, and breastfeeding exposure is unknown.

- **Infant risk**: Potential neonatal EPS and withdrawal with third-trimester exposure; long-lived metabolites may prolong risk.

- **Postpartum use**: No established safety profile; use cautiously with close infant monitoring.

---

## Comparison with established treatments

| **Treatment** | **Evidence level** | **Breastfeeding safety** | **Clinical considerations** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Lithium | High | Compatible with monitoring | - First-line <br/> - Robust relapse prevention |
| Olanzapine | Moderate | Compatible with monitoring | - Sedating <br/> - Useful for agitation/insomnia |
| Quetiapine | Moderate | Compatible with monitoring | - Sedating <br/> - Useful for agitation/insomnia |
| ECT | High | Compatible | - Rapid response <br/> - For severe/refractory cases |
| Cariprazine | None | Unknown | - Off-label <br/> - Use only if alternatives fail |

---

## Clinical recommendations

- **First-line treatments**: Use lithium, olanzapine, quetiapine, or ECT; these have the best evidence and safety data in the postpartum period [^113tvKnD] [^111hxpq5].

- **Cariprazine use**: Consider only when first-line treatments are ineffective or contraindicated, with explicit risk–benefit discussion and close monitoring.

- **Breastfeeding**: Avoid cariprazine if breastfeeding due to unknown infant exposure; monitor infants if exposure occurs.

- **Multidisciplinary care**: Coordinate with maternal–fetal medicine, pediatrics, and lactation consultants.

---

## Conclusion

Cariprazine is not approved for postpartum psychosis and lacks direct evidence or lactation safety data. It may be considered off-label only when first-line treatments fail or are contraindicated, with careful risk–benefit assessment, close monitoring, and coordinated multidisciplinary care.

Conclusion

PPP is a psychiatric emergency necessitating rapid initiation of pharmacotherapy and admission. Although it is a discrete disorder on the bipolar spectrum with effects on both the mother and the infant, it is yet to be recognised as a distinct nosological entity by diagnostic manuals for psychiatric disorders. There is limited research into the aetiology and treatment of PPP. Current evidence for treatment in the acute phase points to antipsychotics, lithium and ECT. Lithium appears to have the strongest evidence for prophylaxis and relapse prevention. As prognosis is generally good when treatment is commenced promptly, further understanding of the risk factors and aetiology of PPP will enable early detection and timely management to reduce illness burden for the mother–infant dyad.

### Is postpartum bipolar disorder a distinct diagnostic entity? [^111NoucU]. Bipolar Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Since the mid‐19th century when Louis‐Victor Marcé's monograph describing the effect of pregnancy, postpartum, and lactation on mental illness was published, the question of whether serious mental illness in the postpartum period is a distinct diagnostic entity has been intensely debated. Marcé noted that each symptom of postpartum mental illness could be found in non‐postpartum cases; however, the syndromes of postpartum illnesses were different from those of nonpuerperal mental illnesses. While DSM does not consider postpartum illnesses as separate entities, the unofficial yet popular classification promulgates the use of terms such as postpartum depression and postpartum psychosis. Until recently, the discussion about the diagnosis of postpartum disorders focused mainly on the distinctiveness of postpartum depression. Evidence for postpartum depression being a separate entity is mixed and depends largely on the definition of the postpartum period. Depression occurring later in the postpartum period appears to be more like depression occurring outside the postpartum period. However, depression in the early postpartum period (usually the first few weeks after delivery) may be a distinct entity, likely due to its later association with bipolar disorder — that is, the subsequent emergence of bipolar symptoms. While childbirth is a well‐known trigger of bipolar disorder in females, there is a lack of information about how it affects the symptom profile, course, and treatment response. Revisiting the debate about whether bipolar disorder in the postpartum period is different from its non‐postpartum counterpart is crucially important to improve the detection, diagnosis, and treatment of postpartum bipolar disorder. Due to the common practice of diagnosing patients with mood episodes and psychotic features as postpartum psychosis, it is unclear how commonly bipolar disorder begins with a manic or mixed episode in the postpartum period. Psychiatric disorders occurring immediately after delivery can be harbingers of bipolar disorder in some cases. Psychiatric disorders that morph into or are followed by bipolar disorder are more likely to have a first onset postpartum or an onset immediately after delivery than disorders occurring later in the postpartum period.

Lithium and other mood stabilisers

There is evidence for lithium as an adjunctive medication in PPP for both acute treatment and prophylaxis, and a case report suggests it may also be effective in monotherapy in acute PPP. In a study of 64 women with PPP, 98.4% achieved clinical remission with a combination of benzodiazepine, antipsychotic and lithium. In this stepwise treatment study, 6.3% achieved remission with a benzodiazepine alone, 18.8% achieved remission with a combination of benzodiazepine and antipsychotic, and 73.4% achieved remission with a combination of benzodiazepine, antipsychotic and lithium. The final step of the study algorithm was ECT, which was not used as all participants had responded to the combination of benzodiazepine, antipsychotic and lithium. In the same cohort, 79.7% of women maintained remission at 9 months postpartum with lithium monotherapy.

Lithium has the most robust evidence base for relapse prevention in PPP. There are concerns about declining rates of lithium prescription worldwide at present, with preference given to second-generation antipsychotics in the treatment of bipolar disorder. Similarly, in PPP, antipsychotics are routinely preferred in clinical practice for long-term relapse prevention, possibly because of clinicians' negative perception of lithium's side effect profile and requirement for blood monitoring. However, given the metabolic risks of antipsychotics in women with PPP and the superiority of evidence for lithium in relapse prevention, we recommend consideration of lithium for relapse prevention in PPP.

There are no studies examining the mood stabilisers lamotrigine or carbamazepine in the treatment of PPP. Sodium valproate should not be used in women of reproductive age. Valproate use in pregnancy carries a significant risk of congenital malformations, developmental disability and reduction in IQ, and increased risk of autism spectrum disorders and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder in infants.

5.2 Suicidal Thoughts and Behaviors in Children, Adolescents and Young Adults

In pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials of antidepressant drugs (SSRIs and other antidepressant classes) that included approximately 77,000 adult patients and 4,500 pediatric patients, the incidence of suicidal thoughts and behaviors in antidepressant-treated patients age 24 years and younger was greater than in placebo-treated patients. There was considerable variation in risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors among drugs, but there was an increased risk identified in young patients for most drugs studied. There were differences in absolute risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors across the different indications, with the highest incidence in patients with MDD. The drug-placebo differences in the number of cases of suicidal thoughts and behaviors per 1000 patients treated are provided in Table 3.

* VRAYLAR is not approved for use in pediatric patients.

It is unknown whether the risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors in children, adolescents, and young adults extends to longer-term use, i.e., beyond four months. However, there is substantial evidence from placebo-controlled maintenance trials in adults with MDD that antidepressants delay the recurrence of depression and that depression itself is a risk factor for suicidal thoughts and behaviors.

Monitor all antidepressant-treated patients for any indication for clinical worsening and emergence of suicidal thoughts and behaviors, especially during the initial few months of drug therapy, and at times of dosage changes. Counsel family members or caregivers of patients to monitor for changes in behavior and to alert the healthcare provider. Consider changing the therapeutic regimen, including possibly discontinuing VRAYLAR, in patients whose depression is persistently worse, or who are experiencing emergent suicidal thoughts or behaviors.

5.3 Cerebrovascular Adverse Reactions, Including Stroke, in Elderly Patients with Dementia -Related Psychosis

In placebo-controlled trials in elderly patients with dementia, patients randomized to risperidone, aripiprazole, and olanzapine had a higher incidence of stroke and transient ischemic attack, including fatal stroke. VRAYLAR is not approved for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^114ZZWRB]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Patients who are pregnant and lactating — Clinicians should weigh the risks and benefits for the maternal–fetal dyad when considering continued BZD prescribing or tapering for pregnant patients (Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation). For infants who have been exposed to BZD in utero and are at risk of neonatal withdrawal symptoms, clinicians should encourage breastfeeding, which can reduce neonatal withdrawal symptoms (Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation), and communicate with the infant's healthcare provider (with parental consent) regarding exposure to BZDs (Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation). Implementation considerations add that clinicians should monitor patients who are pregnant closely for psychiatric symptoms during the BZD taper, as these symptoms may evolve rapidly during the pregnancy and postpartum period due to shifts in metabolism that influence the effects of medications, including BZDs, and clinicians should address evolving psychiatric symptoms as clinically indicated.

### Efficacy and safety of cariprazine in bipolar I depression: a double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 study [^112nQRvy]. Bipolar Disorders (2020). Medium credibility.

2.2 Patients

Adult (18‐65 years) patients with bipolar I disorder using the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM‐5) 24 criteria without psychotic features and a current major depressive episode ≥ 4 weeks and < 12 months confirmed by the Mini‐International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) were included in the study. Patients were required to have a 17‐item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD‐17) 25 total score ≥ 20 and item‐1 score ≥ 2, Clinical Global Impressions ‐ Severity (CGI‐S) score ≥ 4, 26 and Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) 27 score ≤ 12.

For study inclusion, physical examination, clinical laboratory, and ECG results were normal or not judged to be clinically significant by investigators. Pregnancy in women with childbearing potential was excluded with negative serum β‐human chorionic gonadotropin testing. Patients with 4 or more mood episodes in the prior 12 months or any current psychiatric diagnoses, including personality disorders of significant severity to interfere with the study (as judged by the principal investigator), besides bipolar I disorder, or specific phobias, were excluded from the study. Patients were not permitted to have an alcohol or substance use disorder within the previous 6 months; suicide risk (based on Columbia‐Suicide Severity Rating Scale [C‐SSRS] 28 assessment, suicide attempt in the last year, HAMD‐17 item‐3 score ≥ 3, or MADRS item‐10 score ≥ 4) or risk of injury to self or others (based on investigator's judgment); nonresponse in the current depressive episode to ≥ 2 antidepressant trials of adequate dose; or treatment failure (in current depressive episode) of quetiapine, lurasidone, or olanzapine and fluoxetine combination. Patients with concurrent medical conditions were excluded if they were judged to have the potential to interfere with study participation, confound interpretation of results, or endanger the patient's well‐being. The only psychotropic drugs permitted for use during the study were eszopiclone, zolpidem, zopiclone, chloral hydrate, or zaleplon (for insomnia), lorazepam or equivalent benzodiazepine (maximum daily dosage 2.0 mg if the dose had been stable for 1 month prior to screening), rescue doses of lorazepam or equivalent benzodiazepine (for agitation/restlessness/hostility; maximum daily dose 2.0 mg for a maximum of 3 consecutive days), rescue doses of diphenhydramine or benztropine (for extrapyramidal symptoms [EPS]), or propranolol (for akathisia that emerged or worsened during the study).

Discussion

PP is relatively a rare disorder that most commonly presents within the first 2–4 weeks after delivery, but can emerge as early as 2–3 days after childbirth. Rapid mood fluctuation is considered the hallmark; however, the rapid onset of paranoia, grandiosity, bizarre delusions, confused thinking and grossly disorganised behaviour may also be present. Insomnia, anxiety or depressed mood have been reported as early warning symptoms prior to PP.PP is a unique disease in that its trigger is definable: childbirth. Exact pathophysiology of the disease; however, has yet to be determined, with several theories ranging from hormonal change to immune dysregulation and circadian rhythm disruption. In this particular case, the patient's history of hypothyroidism and levothyroxine use during pregnancy gives credence to an autoimmune aetiology to her PP, with literature demonstrating a strong association between PP and autoimmune thyroiditis/thyroid dysfunction. Understanding of risk factors would facilitate timely and appropriate response from health professionals via heightened awareness and proper preventive measures such as lithium prophylaxis. These risk factors related to PP; however, are still poorly understood and rarely studied.

PP is a clinical diagnosis. The DSM-5 does not recognise PP as a distinct condition; rather, it adds a "with a postpartum onset" specifier if a woman met criteria for a brief psychotic disorder during or within 4 weeks post partum. Due to its similar presentation, bipolar disorder is an important differential diagnosis that must be considered, especially with prior history. Other psychiatric conditions that must be included, but are not limited to, are generalised anxiety disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder and postpartum depression, as well as organic causes of psychosis such as infection, recreational drugs and electrolyte disturbances to name a few. Notwithstanding the classification in DSM-5, PP is a psychiatric emergency that requires urgent evaluation, psychiatric referral and inpatient hospitalisation due to the gravity of consequences, such as suicide, infanticide, impaired mother–infant bonding, infant abuse and neglect. While the overall prognosis is positive for women who have sought help, screening protocols or treatment guidelines have yet to be established. Atypical antipsychotics, mood stabilisers and antiepileptics are common drugs of choice along with electroconvulsive therapy; however, there is a paucity of evidence to support their efficacy due to the difficulty of randomised trials.

### A review of postpartum psychosis [^1157UEBB]. Journal of Women's Health (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective is to provide an overview of the clinical features, prognosis, differential diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of postpartum psychosis.

Methods

The authors searched Medline (1966–2005), PsycInfo (1974–2005), Toxnet, and PubMed databases using the key words postpartum psychosis, depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, organic psychosis, pharmacotherapy, psychotherapy, and electroconvulsive therapy. A clinical case is used to facilitate the discussion.

Results

The onset of puerperal psychosis occurs in the first 1–4 weeks after childbirth. The data suggest that postpartum psychosis is an overt presentation of bipolar disorder that is timed to coincide with tremendous hormonal shifts after delivery. The patient develops frank psychosis, cognitive impairment, and grossly disorganized behavior that represent a complete change from previous functioning. These perturbations, in combination with lapsed insight into her illness and symptoms, can lead to devastating consequences in which the safety and well-being of the affected mother and her offspring are jeopardized. Therefore, careful and repeated assessment of the mothers' symptoms, safety, and functional capacity is imperative. Treatment is dictated by the underlying diagnosis, bipolar disorder, and guided by the symptom acuity, patient's response to past treatments, drug tolerability, and breastfeeding preference. The somatic therapies include antimanic agents, atypical antipsychotic medications, and ECT. Estrogen prophylaxis remains purely investigational.

Conclusions

The rapid and accurate diagnosis of postpartum psychosis is essential to expedite appropriate treatment and to allow for quick, full recovery, prevention of future episodes, and reduction of risk to the mother and her children and family.

It is also noteworthy that CAR and ARI are not the only two known inhibitors of DHCR7. A side effect of elevated 7-DHC levels have been described for a number of commonly prescribed pharmaceutical compounds, including trazodone, haloperidol, sertraline, amiodarone, trifluoperazine, fluphenazine, perphenazine, and various chemicals in our surroundings. Undoubtedly, while they are safe and effective compounds for the vast majority of human population, we believe that their effects in the context of patient genotype and life condition (e.g. pregnancy or comorbidity) remains understudied.

The utility of CAR to treat schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in the general population is not questioned by our findings. However, in the light of our results, it is important to consider alternative medications for use during pregnancy. From a precision medicine standpoint, one should consider that the 1–3% of patient population with single-allele DHCR7 mutations might not be the ideal candidates for use of CAR, especially if they are nursing, pregnant, or plan to become pregnant.

### Antipsychotic medication for women with schizophrenia spectrum disorders [^114eoMMS]. Psychological Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Special considerations regarding pharmacotherapy in postpartum women

After birth and especially in the first few weeks after delivery, women with bipolar disorder, schizoaffective disorder, or a history of postpartum psychosis are at an increased risk of postpartum psychosis due to hormonal alterations, neuro-immune changes and psychosocial factors (Hazelgrove et al; Meltzer-Brody et al.). In these women, it is important to closely monitor clinical symptoms in this period and to consider continuation of antipsychotic treatment (Jones, Chandra, Dazzan, & Howard). Of note, pharmacological agents that suppress lactation are usually dopamine D2 agonists and are suggested to increase the risk of postpartum psychosis. This type of medication should, therefore, not be prescribed in postpartum women with SSD (Snellen, Power, Blankley, & Galbally).

Breastfeeding

Although breastfeeding has clear benefits for bonding and immunity (Chandra, Babu, & Desai,), women with SSD are currently encouraged to breastfeed, unless they are taking clozapine (NICE). Although all antipsychotics are excreted into the breastmilk, the amount of active ingredients that is transferred to the infant is relatively low (Pacchiarotti et al.). Based on a systematic review of 49 studies, the highest penetration ratio has been found for amisulpride, followed by clozapine and haloperidol (Schoretsanitis, Westin, Deligiannidis, Spigset, & Paulzen). Anecdotal evidence on clozapine has reported considerable concentrations in breast milk, risk of agranulocytosis in the infant and potentially delayed speech development low (Pacchiarotti et al.). Based on the current literature, positive safety data are most consistent for olanzapine (Zincir). Apart from clozapine, other common antipsychotics are rarely associated with adverse events (Uguz,), but monitoring of neurodevelopment and motor abnormalities is warranted due to the limited amount of evidence (McAllister-Williams et al; NICE). Taken together, the choice of feeding method and about which antipsychotic is best taken is difficult and should be part of a shared decision process involving the partner and paediatrician (Table 2).

Prophylaxis during pregnancy

Different strategies for prophylaxis may be necessary for women with a history of bipolar disorder and those with a history of PPP. While women with isolated episodes of PPP are at increased risk for subsequent postpartum episodes, one study found no risk of episodes during pregnancy, even when women do not take medications during pregnancy. Thus, there is no indication for women with isolated episodes of PPP to start prophylactic medication during pregnancy, although they should be monitored during this period.

A detailed discussion of the management of bipolar disorder in the perinatal period is beyond the scope of this review. We recommend referring to evidence-based guidelines such as the British Association of Psychopharmacology (BAP) guidelines on the management of perinatal mental illness and National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines on antenatal and postnatal mental health. Updated information on foetal and infant effects of individual psychotropic drugs in pregnancy can be found in databases such as the UK Teratology Information Service and the List of Pregnancy Exposure Registries.

### A father with postpartum psychosis [^114QNd8n]. BMJ Case Reports (2012). Medium credibility.

Postpartum psychosis is a rare, however severe mood disorder in the perinatal period. It is most commonly associated with postpartum bipolar disorder. The author reports a case where a male patient with psychosis was admitted to the psychiatric unit 5 days after his wife gave birth to their male child. The patient was very concerned about the well being of his child and was afraid that something bad would happen to his child. The patient was diagnosed with an acute manic episode with psychotic symptoms and treated with olanzapine and lithium. The patient has been continued on therapeutic dose of lithium without any relapse of the symptoms, 3 months after the initial episode. The role of psychological stress in precipitating such a severe mood or psychotic disorder needs to be highlighted.

### Practice guideline for the treatment of patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder [^1154VXoj]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2007). Medium credibility.

Pregnancy — antipsychotics and benzodiazepines: "The relative safety of administering first-generation antipsychotics, especially trifluoperazine and perphenazine, during pregnancy is supported by a large database (300)". In contrast, "The data regarding second-generation antipsychotics consist only of case reports and case series totaling fewer than 100 children for any individual drug except clozapine, for which the total approaches 150 children". Regulatory risk categorization is stated: "The FDA classifies all second-generation antipsychotics as pregnancy risk Category C ("Risk cannot be ruled out"), except clozapine, which is classified as Category B ("No evidence of risk in humans")". For benzodiazepines, "Benzodiazepines are apparently not associated with a significant risk of somatic teratogenesis, but the risk of neurobehavioral effects is unclear because of conflicting reports (300, 302)", and practice advice includes that "The reviewers recommend tapering these drugs before delivery when possible and using benzodiazepines in FDA Category C (i.e., clonazepam) or those with less potential for fetal accumulation (i.e., lorazepam and oxazepam)".

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for management of bipolar disorder [^111hPCP7]. VA/DoD (2023). High credibility.

Bipolar disorder — maintenance and acute mania pharmacotherapy considerations emphasize that "Priority should be given to treatments effective for maintenance treatment to prevent the return of mood episodes; maintenance treatment is the cornerstone of treatment for BD". Evidence suggests that aripiprazole has potentially less efficacy compared with other agents. Valproate shows a small effect size (0.26) with liver toxicity and coagulopathy risks, its use "should be considered carefully", and "Valproate should be prescribed only as a last resort to individuals of childbearing potential" due to teratogenic and developmental harms. Carbamazepine poses severe risks to women of childbearing potential, has a Black Box warning recommending genomic testing (for HLA-B✱1502) in certain populations — specifically for those of Chinese descent — because of risk of a deadly rash (Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis [SJS/TEN]) and also has many drug–drug interactions. Patient preferences vary given side effect profiles: haloperidol has a higher risk of extrapyramidal adverse effects, and cariprazine had a 29% incidence of extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) and a 21% incidence of akathisia in trials in BD. Asenapine requires sublingual administration for several minutes (twice daily) with unclear feasibility in more severely ill manic patients, and there is a lack of evidence for effectiveness of the asenapine transdermal patch. Ziprasidone must be taken twice daily with 500 kilocalories of food for proper absorption, and the intramuscular formulation takes increased time to administer secondary to preparation. The Work Group categorized the evidence as Reviewed, New-added with low confidence and noted limitations; benefits of these drugs in acute mania slightly outweighed harms, and because these treatments have no evidence preventing recurrence of mania or depression, "these drugs are not recommended as preferred treatments for acute mania".

8.1 Pregnancy

Pregnancy Exposure Registry

There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to VRAYLAR during pregnancy. For more information, contact the National Pregnancy Registry for Atypical Antipsychotics at 1–866–961–2388 or visit http://womensmentalhealth.org/clinical-and-research-programs/pregnancyregistry/.

Risk Summary

Neonates exposed to antipsychotic drugs during the third trimester of pregnancy are at risk for extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms following delivery (see Clinical Considerations). There are no available data on VRAYLAR use in pregnant women to inform any drug-associated risks for birth defects or miscarriage. The major active metabolite of cariprazine, DDCAR, has been detected in adult patients up to 12 weeks after discontinuation of VRAYLAR [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Based on animal data, VRAYLAR may cause fetal harm.

Administration of cariprazine to rats during the period of organogenesis caused malformations, lower pup survival, and developmental delays at drug exposures less than the human exposure at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 6 mg/day. However, cariprazine was not teratogenic in rabbits at doses up to 4.6 times the MRHD of 6 mg/day [see Data].

### Psychotropic treatment during pregnancy: research synthesis and clinical care principles [^115bG7FA]. Journal of Women's Health (2020). Medium credibility.

Background: Psychiatric illnesses are common in women of childbearing age. The perinatal period is a particularly high-risk time for depression, bipolar, and anxiety disorders. Methods: The scope of the public health problem of perinatal mental disorders is discussed followed by an examination of the specific research methods utilized for the study of birth and developmental outcomes associated with maternal mental illness and its treatment. The evidence on exposure to common psychotropics during pregnancy and breastfeeding is reviewed. Results: Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors or serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor medications are not associated with higher rates of birth defects or long-term changes in mental development after adjustment for confounding factors associated with underlying psychiatric illness. Lithium exposure is associated with an increased risk for fetal cardiac malformations, but this risk is lower than previously thought (absolute risk of Ebstein's anomaly 6/1,000). Antipsychotics, other than risperidone and potentially paliperidone, have not been associated with an increase in birth defects; olanzapine and quetiapine have been linked with an elevated risk of gestational diabetes. Due to the dramatic physiological changes of pregnancy and enhanced hepatic metabolism, drug doses may need to be adjusted during pregnancy to sustain efficacy. Untreated maternal psychiatric illness also carries substantial risks for the mother, fetus, infant, and family. Conclusions: The goal of perinatal mental health treatment is to optimally provide pharmacotherapy to mitigate the somatic and psychosocial burdens of maternal psychiatric disorders. Regular symptom monitoring during pregnancy and postpartum and medication dose adjustments to sustain efficacy constitutes good practice.

### The relationship between postpartum psychosis and bipolar disorder: a review [^112ShQPS]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2003). Low credibility.

Background

The evidence for a spectrum of bipolar disorders is mounting. Of particular interest and importance is the evolution and recurrence of bipolar disorder in the postpartum period and its relationship to postpartum psychosis. Understanding whether such a phenomenological link exists has diagnostic, prognostic, and treatment implications.

Objectives

A comprehensive review of (1) the literature regarding the relationships between postpartum psychosis and bipolar affective disorder, (2) the data regarding prophylactic treatment and acute management of postpartum psychosis and bipolar disorder in the puerperium, and (3) critical areas for future research.

Study Design

MEDLINE and PubMed (1966–2002) databases were searched for English-language articles using the keywords postpartum/puerperal depression, puerperal/postpartum psychosis, bipolar disorder, lithium, anticonvulsants, antipsychotics, and breastfeeding.

Results

Evidence from studies of women with a history of bipolar disorder, longitudinal studies of women with puerperal episodes of psychosis, and family studies support a link between postpartum psychosis and bipolar disorder.

Conclusions

Understanding the relationship between postpartum psychosis and bipolar disorder has implications for perinatal and long-term treatment. Prophylactic treatment of women with bipolar disorder and/or a history of postpartum psychosis may be indicated. Epidemiological, genetic, and pharmacologic research must be completed to understand, prevent, and adequately treat postpartum psychosis.

### Postpartum psychosis: madness, mania, and melancholia in motherhood [^116FbNtB]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

Psychosis or mania after childbirth is a psychiatric emergency with risk for suicide and infanticide.

Method

The authors reviewed the epidemiologic and genetic research and physiological postpartum triggers (endocrine, immunological, circadian) of psychosis. They also summarized all systematic reviews and synthesized the sparse clinical studies to provide diagnostic recommendations, treatment options, and strategies for prevention.

Results

The incidence of first-lifetime onset postpartum psychosis/mania from population-based register studies of psychiatric admissions varies from 0.25 to 0.6 per 1,000 births. After an incipient episode, 20%-50% of women have isolated postpartum psychosis. The remaining women have episodes outside the perinatal period, usually within the bipolar spectrum. Presumably, the mechanism of onset is related to physiological changes after birth (e.g., hormonal, immunological, circadian), which precipitate disease in genetically vulnerable women. Some women have treatable causes and comorbidities, such as autoimmune thyroiditis or infections. N-methyl-d-aspartate-encephalitis or inborn errors of metabolism may present after birth with psychosis. Fewer than 30 publications have focused on the treatment of postpartum psychosis. The largest study (N = 64) provided evidence that lithium is highly efficacious for both acute and maintenance treatment. Another report (N = 34) described successful ECT treatment. Inpatient care is usually required to ensure safety, complete the diagnostic evaluation, and initiate treatment. The relapse risk after a subsequent pregnancy for women with isolated postpartum psychoses is 31% (95% CI = 22–42). Strategies for prevention of postpartum psychosis include lithium prophylaxis immediately postpartum and proactive safety monitoring.

Conclusions

Postpartum psychosis offers an intriguing model to explore etiologic contributions to the neurobiology of affective psychosis.

### Bromocriptine mesylate (Cycloset) [^117NJZdX]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.4 Somnolence

CYCLOSET may cause somnolence. In a 52-week, randomized clinical trial, 4.3% of CYCLOSET-treated patients and 1.3% of placebo-treated patients reported somnolence. None of these events were reported as serious, and the majority of patients reported resolution of somnolence over time. Inform patients of the risk of somnolence, particularly when initiating therapy with CYCLOSET. Patients experiencing somnolence should refrain from driving or operating heavy machinery.

5.5 Interaction with Dopamine Receptor Antagonists

Dopamine receptor antagonists, including neuroleptic agents that have dopamine D2 receptor antagonist properties (e.g., clozapine, olanzapine, ziprasidone), may reduce the effectiveness of CYCLOSET, and CYCLOSET may reduce the effectiveness of these agents. CYCLOSET has not been studied in patients taking neuroleptic drugs. The concomitant use of CYCLOSET and dopamine receptor antagonists, including neuroleptic drugs, is not recommended.

5.6 Other Dopamine Receptor Agonists

Other dopamine receptor agonists are indicated for the treatment of Parkinson's disease, hyperprolactinemia, restless leg syndrome, acromegaly, and other disorders. The effectiveness and safety of CYCLOSET in patients who are already taking one of these other dopamine receptor agonists is unknown. Concomitant use is not recommended.

5.7 Risks in Postpartum Patients

CYCLOSET is contraindicated in postpartum patients. Serious and life-threatening adverse reactions including hypertension, myocardial infarction, seizures, stroke and psychosis have been reported postmarketing in postpartum women who were administered bromocriptine for inhibition of lactation [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. These risks may be higher in postpartum patients with cardiovascular disease. The indication for use of bromocriptine for inhibition of postpartum lactation was withdrawn from bromocriptine-containing products and is not approved for CYCLOSET.

### Postpartum psychosis: a proposed treatment algorithm [^114jWAug]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). Medium credibility.

Prophylaxis in the postpartum period

In women with a history of PPP, prophylactic antipsychotic medications or lithium should be started immediately after delivery to reduce the risk of relapse. There is an argument for introducing prophylaxis 2–4 weeks before delivery as a preventative measure in some cases of PPP, as postpartum prophylaxis is thought to come too late. However, there is no available data at present to support this practice. Lithium has the most robust evidence base for relapse prevention in PPP and may be considered the medication of choice for prophylaxis. Physiological changes in the perinatal period affect lithium pharmacokinetics and necessitate more frequent lithium blood level monitoring and dose adjustments in the perinatal period. Lithium levels should be checked twice weekly in the first 2 weeks postpartum, and target lithium levels should be high (0.8–1.0 mmol/L) during the first month postpartum for relapse prevention. A cohort study suggests that rates of relapse are low up to 9 months postpartum in women with PPP treated with lithium. Lithium dose may start to be tapered after 3 months postpartum but should be continued for 1 year postpartum for sustained remission.

There is evidence from a small sample study for the efficacy of olanzapine in the prophylaxis of PPP in the early postpartum period, although this needs replication in larger studies. The sedative side effects of olanzapine may be beneficial in improving sleep. Psychoeducation about minimising the risk of recurrence, with information about sleep hygiene and the use of medication to help reduce sleep loss around the time of delivery and in the early postpartum period is also important.

Breastfeeding is an important consideration in women at risk of developing PPP.

While the risks and benefits of prophylactic medication and the woman's preference for breastfeeding should be considered, it is important to bear in mind that sleep deprivation associated with breastfeeding can precipitate a relapse of PPP. Lithium crosses into breast milk in large quantities and can have an effect on the infant. Low levels of olanzapine are found in breast milk, and undetectable levels have been reported in the serum of breastfed infants. Infant sedation has been reported with olanzapine. Therefore, women with a history of PPP should be advised that breastfeeding, if it prevents adequate pharmacological prophylaxis and affects sleep, may increase the risk of relapse, with subsequent negative effects on the mother–infant dyad. Please see the section on breastfeeding below for a detailed discussion.

### Preventive interventions for postnatal psychosis [^114BTUG3]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Postnatal psychosis is a worldwide life-threatening condition that affects one to two in every 1000 new mothers. It has an abrupt onset within a month of childbirth. Affected new mothers rapidly develop frank psychosis, cognitive impairment, and disorganised behaviours. Factors that increase the risk of postnatal psychosis include primiparous mothers who are single, women who are older, or with a past psychiatric history and family history of affective psychosis, prenatal depression and autoimmune thyroid dysfunction. The risk of a future postnatal recurrence is 25% to 57%. Preventive interventions for postnatal psychosis aim at identifying women with risk factors, early recognition of imminent psychosis through screening, and preventive drug therapy. Mood stabilisers, antipsychotic drugs and hormone therapy may be beneficial in the prevention of postnatal psychotic episodes in women at risk.

Objectives

To investigate the best available evidence for interventions aimed at preventing postnatal psychosis.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in October 2012 using the search strategy of the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group.

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials relevant to the prevention of postnatal psychosis.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors inspected all citations to ensure reliable selection. If we had included relevant trials, we planned to assess the methodological quality of identified trials using the criteria recommended in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. Two review authors would have independently extracted data. For homogenous dichotomous data, we planned to calculate the risk ratio (RR), 95% confidence interval (CI), and the number needed to treat to benefit/harm (NNTB/NNTH) on an intention-to-treat basis.

Main Results

There are no included studies in this review. The electronic search produced three relevant references, among which we identified two old planned trials that seem never to have started, and one which we excluded a study because it was a report of a case series.

Authors' Conclusions

This is not an empty review - it is a review full of unanswered questions. Despite growing interest in women's mental health, the literature in the area of postnatal psychosis is still very limited. It seems that clinicians have no choice but to continue with their current practices guided solely by varied clinical judgement. Women at risk of postnatal psychosis and their relatives are justified to be disappointed in the medical/research fraternity. A post hoc PubMed topic (not methodology-specific) search identified mainly case series. Policy makers have no trial-based evidence upon which to base their guidelines. Certainly, preventive interventions for postnatal psychosis are difficult to justify with confidence without well-designed, well-conducted, and well-reported randomised studies. Available publications suggest that such studies are possible and funders of research may wish to make this work a priority.

### Antipsychotic drugs for non-affective psychosis during pregnancy and postpartum [^115pmN5G]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Antipsychotics are commonly prescribed for women suffering psychotic illnesses during pregnancy and the postpartum period. The potential adverse consequences of these different options are multiple and complex, impacting on the foetus, neonate, infant and early development of the child as well as the woman herself.

Objectives

To establish whether the benefits of taking antipsychotic drugs outweigh the risks for pregnant or post partum women.

Search Strategy

The Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Register (January 2003) was searched in order to identify all published trials of women during pregnancy or the postpartum period. We inspected all references of all identified studies. If any studies had been found, the first authors of each included study would have been contacted.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled clinical trials investigating the effects of any type of antipsychotic drug compared with any other treatment option (including standard psychosocial care, any other antipsychotic drug, or an alternative therapy such as electro-convulsive therapy or cognitive behavioural therapy) and involving pregnant women and/or women during the postpartum period diagnosed with a non-affective psychotic disorder.

Data Collection and Analysis

Citations, and where possible, abstracts were independently inspected by reviewers and the papers ordered were scrutinised and quality assessed. Data would have been extracted independently by at least two reviewers. Binary outcomes were to have been analysed using Relative Risks (RR) and their 95% Confidence Intervals (CI).

Main Results

We found no trials that met the broad inclusion criteria.

Reviewers' Conclusions

Current guidelines and clinical practice for the use of antipsychotic drugs in women with non-affective disorders during pregnancy and postpartum are not based on evidence from randomised controlled trials. Although ethical concerns have to date precluded the use of randomised controlled trials to address this research topic, the continued use of antipsychotic drugs in this group of women in itself poses significant clinical and ethical problems. Evidence is required from large pragmatic trials that reflect routine clinical practice, examine a broad range of outcomes and accurately quantify risks and benefits to both mothers and their offspring, so that comparison between different treatment options can be made.

### The treatment of postpartum depression: minimizing infant exposures [^113soTqG]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2002). Low credibility.

The first 3 postpartum months represent a high-risk period for psychiatric illnesses. This article reviews the prevalence and diagnostic criteria for postpartum illnesses, including the "maternal blues", postpartum depression, and postpartum psychosis. Pharmacologic treatment of these disorders is often complicated by a patient's desire to breast-feed, yet there are no controlled trials of antidepressant treatment during lactation. Infant exposure and limitations to monitoring infant sera are reviewed. Lastly, a model and guide for reducing fetal and infant exposures is presented.

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Patient Information).

Hypotension

Advise patients that they may develop postural (orthostatic) hypotension with or without symptoms such as dizziness, nausea, and diaphoresis. Hypotension and syncope may occur more frequently during initial therapy or with an increase in dose at any time. During early treatment with CYCLOSET, advise patients to make slow postural changes and to avoid situations that could predispose to serious injury if syncope was to occur [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Impulse Control/Compulsive Behaviors

Advise patients that they may experience impulse control and/or compulsive behaviors while taking CYCLOSET and to inform their physician or healthcare provider if they develop new or increased gambling urges, sexual urges, uncontrolled spending, binge or compulsive eating, or other urges while being treated with CYCLOSET [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

Somnolence

Advise patients that CYCLOSET may cause somnolence. Advise patients not to operate heavy machinery if symptoms of somnolence occur [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

Pregnancy and Lactation

Advise patients not to take CYCLOSET postpartum or while lactating [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7), Use in Specific Populations (8.2)]. Serious and life-threatening adverse reactions including hypertension, myocardial infarction, seizures, stroke and psychosis have been reported in postpartum women who were administered bromocriptine for inhibition of lactation.

Missed Doses

Advise patients to take CYCLOSET within 2 hours after waking in the morning. If the morning dose is missed, instruct patients to take their usual dose the following morning. Doses of CYCLOSET should not be doubled the following morning.

### Secondary effects of antipsychotics: women at greater risk than men [^1138NRZv]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2009). Low credibility.

Context

The health burden of antipsychotic medication is well known, but the disproportionate effect on women as compared with men is underappreciated.

Objective

The goal of this article is preventive — to better inform clinicians so that the risks to women and to their offspring can be diminished.

Method

All PubMed sources in which the search term gender (or sex) was linked to a side effect of antipsychotic medication were reviewed.

Result

There is general agreement in the literature on women's increased susceptibility to weight gain, diabetes, and specific cardiovascular risks of antipsychotics, with less consensus on malignancy risks and risks to the fetus. Cardiovascular death, to which men are more susceptible than women, is disproportionately increased in women by the use of antipsychotics. Sedating antipsychotics raise the risk of embolic phenomena during pregnancy, and postpartum. Prolactin-elevating drugs suppress gonadal hormone secretion and may enhance autoimmune proclivity.

Conclusions

Clinicians need to be aware of the differential harm that women (and their offspring) can incur from the side effects of antipsychotics.

### Aripiprazole (Abilify myCite) [^116r94iN]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

8.2 Lactation

Risk Summary

Aripiprazole is present in human breast milk. Based on published case reports and pharmacovigilance reports, aripiprazole exposure during pregnancy and/or the postpartum period may lead to clinically relevant decreases in milk supply which may be reversible with discontinuation of the drug. There are also reports of aripiprazole exposure during pregnancy and no maternal milk supply in the post-partum period. Effects on milk supply may be mediated through decreases in prolactin levels, which have been observed [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Monitor the breastfed infant for dehydration and lack of appropriate weight gain. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for ABILIFY MYCITE and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from ABILIFY MYCITE or from the underlying maternal condition.

8.4 Pediatric Use

Safety and effectiveness of ABILIFY MYCITE in pediatric patients have not been established.

Antidepressants increased the risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors in pediatric patients [see Boxed Warning, and Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

8.5 Geriatric Use

No dosage adjustment of ABILIFY MYCITE is recommended for elderly patients for the approved indications [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Of the 13,543 patients treated with oral aripiprazole in clinical trials, 1,073 (8%) were ≥ 65 years old and 799 (6%) were ≥ 75 years old. Placebo-controlled studies of oral aripiprazole in schizophrenia, bipolar mania, or major depressive disorder did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients.

Elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with antipsychotic drugs are at an increased risk of death. Elderly patients treated with antipsychotic drugs with dementia-related psychosis had a greater incidence of stroke and transient ischemic attack. ABILIFY MYCITE is not approved for the treatment of elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.3)].

### Treatment with antipsychotics in pregnancy: changes in drug disposition [^111SvCWZ]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2018). Low credibility.

Whether or not to prescribe antipsychotic drugs during pregnancy is a challenging dilemma. One the one hand, treating the mother necessarily implies exposing the fetus to the drug, thereby potentially causing harmful effects to the unborn child. On the other hand, abstaining from treatment puts the mother at risk of a worsened psychiatric condition, with the dangers this involves for the mother and child. Weighing these options against each other, the recommendation has often been to discontinue treatment, especially during the first trimester. 1 However, during the past decade more safety data have accumulated suggesting that antipsychotics are relatively safe to use in pregnancy. 1, 2, 3 It has also been demonstrated that discontinuing ongoing maintenance treatment for severe mood and psychotic disorders during pregnancy carries a high risk of disease recurrence. 2 Thus, for women with substantial psychiatric morbidity and good treatment response, maintained use of an antipsychotic during pregnancy might often represent the best risk–benefit option.

When a decision has been made to commence or continue pharmacological treatment during pregnancy, there is a paucity of data to ensure appropriate dosing. Numerous physiological changes occur during pregnancy, some of which may cause changes in drug disposition, e.g. due to alterations in body weight, plasma volume, hepatic metabolic capacity, and renal function. 4, 5, 6, 7 Thus, the right drug dose for a woman prior to conception or for the patient group in general is not necessarily the right dose during pregnancy. For antipsychotics, evidence on changes in drug disposition in pregnancy is extremely scarce and confined to one case report on quetiapine 8 and a small cases series on aripiprazole. 9 The aim of this study was to elucidate to what extent pregnancy affects serum concentrations of antipsychotic drugs in a large target population in a naturalistic setting.

### Aripiprazole use during pregnancy, peripartum and lactation. A systematic literature search and review to inform clinical practice [^1177F1LZ]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Aripiprazole is used relatively frequently in women with bipolar disorder or schizophrenia in childbearing years, owing to its efficacy and relatively favorable side effect profile. As is the case for other psychotropic medications, for ethical reasons, no prospective randomized placebo controlled trial to assess aripiprazole safety during pregnancy has ever been conducted. However, animal data are available and the amount of exposure and outcome data for human fetuses and infants has recently increased, providing published prospective safety data in relatively large numbers of pregnant women treated with aripiprazole. The aim of this study was to perform a systematic literature search and review to critically evaluate the available data on the use of aripiprazole during pregnancy, peripartum and lactation.

Methods

PubMed, PsychInfo, and Cochrane Library were searched using the following search builder: (pregnancy OR pregnant OR gestation OR malformations OR perinatal OR reproduction OR organogenesis OR delivery OR breast-feeding OR lactation or peripartum or obstetric) AND aripiprazole. Reports that met the following pre-defined criteria were included in the present review: (1) published in English language in a peer-reviewed journal; (2) clearly defined use of aripiprazole during pregnancy and/or lactation and/or postpartum; (3) case report, case series, prospective, retrospective or cross-sectional studies. United States and European Medicine Agency prescribing information for aripiprazole were consulted as well and all the references of selected papers were cross checked for information pertaining to the use of aripiprazole during pregnancy, peripartum and lactation.

Results

A total of 549 items published in a period ranging from 1995 to 2017, were retrieved from the search databases and reference cross check. One-hundred-fifty-three duplicate items were removed, 176 titles were deemed as not pertinent, 220 abstracts and 122 full-text articles were assessed for eligibility and 93 titles were included for qualitative synthesis. United States and European Medicine Agency prescribing information for aripiprazole were consulted and the selected manuscript references were cross checked. No randomized placebo controlled trial was found but relatively large prospective studies, large database studies, and several case reports and case studies were identified and summarized.

Conclusions

As is the case for other antipsychotics, definitive evidence on aripiprazole reproductive safety is lacking, but newer safety data are relatively reassuring. In many cases, the potential benefits of aripiprazole for patients with bipolar disorder or schizophrenia outweigh the potential risks.

### Recognizing and managing postpartum psychosis: a clinical guide for obstetric providers [^116SfwWN]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Postpartum psychosis is a psychiatric emergency that affects 1 to 2 per 1000 women. Key clinical features include mood fluctuation, abnormal thoughts or behaviors, and confusion. Women with a history of bipolar disorder are at heightened risk, as are first-time mothers; current research on the causes focuses on biological triggers, such as immune dysregulation. Women with postpartum psychosis require inpatient hospitalization and should be treated with lithium, antipsychotics, and benzodiazepines.

### Perinatal psychiatric episodes: a population-based study on treatment incidence and prevalence [^116EF4kc]. Translational Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Psychiatric episodes during pregnancy and following childbirth are complex, as the well-being of both the mother and infant must be considered in all treatment decisions. There is general consensus that childbirth triggers new postpartum episodes that can be on a spectrum of mild-to-severe presentation. The severe episodes affect 1–2 per 1000 new mothers, and have been described and quantified in a range of diverse studies using different data sources and study designs, for example, refs. Episodes requiring psychiatric hospitalization and specialist treatment in secondary and tertiary health-care systems are thought to be on the severe end of the spectrum. They are often characterized by severe depression with suicidal ideation, or as postpartum psychosis that has been closely associated with bipolar affective disorders, although it does not have a specific diagnoses. Adding to this, a proportion of more moderate postpartum psychiatric episodes will be treated in primary care with prescription drugs. Although the threshold for using pharmacological therapy is different in the perinatal period due to concerns about possible risks to the fetus and breastfeeding infant, antidepressants are used as one treatment option for perinatal depression, particularly non-psychotic moderate-to-severe depression. Antidepressant use in the perinatal period has increased over time, as it has for depression outside the perinatal period. Furthermore, the prevalence of antidepressant use in pregnancy varies significantly between countries and across studies: 3% in Denmarkand 13% in the United States, overall challenging direct comparisons across time periods and between studies. Adding to this, evidence suggests that some perinatal psychiatric episodes will be unnoticed and consequently untreated, with one recent study highlighting that pharmacological treatment is less likely to be prescribed in perinatal illnesses compared with other time points.

Together, postpartum psychiatric episodes comprise a range of different disorders and symptom severity, which subsequently are diagnosed and treated in a range of treatment settings. This poses a significant challenge to the investigation of incidence of postpartum psychiatric episodes, as the data from various settings are needed. An additional challenge is that the most available data in the field does not differentiate between first-time episodes vs recurrent episodes, which in epidemiological terms can be described as mixing incident and prevalent case groups. Finally, past diagnostic specifiers in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) and International Classification of Diseases (ICD) diagnostic systems vary in terms of defining postpartum onset ranging from 4 to 6 weeks postpartum, with the recent shift from DSM-4 to DSM-5 to also include psychiatric episodes in pregnancy as well as postpartum episodes.

5.1 Increased Mortality in Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis

Antipsychotic drugs increase the all-cause risk of death in elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis. Analyses of 17 dementia-related psychosis placebo-controlled trials (modal duration of 10 weeks and largely in patients taking atypical antipsychotic drugs) revealed a risk of death in the drug-treated patients of between 1.6 to 1.7 times that in placebo-treated patients. Over the course of a typical 10-week controlled trial, the rate of death in drug-treated patients was about 4.5%, compared to a rate of about 2.6% in placebo-treated patients.

Although the causes of death were varied, most of the deaths appeared to be either cardiovascular (e.g., heart failure, sudden death) or infectious (e.g., pneumonia) in nature. VRAYLAR is not approved for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

### Clozapine treatment during pregnancy and the postpartum period: a systematic literature review [^116Thspw]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective: The objective of this systematic review was to provide a critical appraisal of the evidence related to the safety of clozapine for schizophrenia during pregnancy and lactation.

Data Sources: PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Library were searched from inception through December 2020. Reference lists of included studies were hand-searched. The International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov were searched for unpublished trials, and PROSPERO was searched for unpublished reviews. The current marketing authorization holder of the originator brands Clozaril and Leponex was also contacted for pharmacovigilance data.

Study Selection: Original reports published in English, German, French, or Dutch containing clinical and preclinical data were included if they provided data on maternal, fetal, and neonatal outcomes after clozapine exposure during pregnancy or lactation.

Data Extraction: Two reviewers independently extracted relevant data.

Results: A total of 860 records were identified, and the full texts of 117 articles were reviewed. Forty-two studies met the inclusion criteria. Data on perinatal clozapine exposure are of limited quality and quantity. Although clozapine demonstrates partial placental passage, data thus far do not support that clozapine is teratogenic; that it increases the risk of stillbirth, abortion, or fetal disorders; or that it increases the risk of delivery complications or premature birth. Information about clozapine exposure through breast milk is scarce, but based on its chemical properties, it is likely that clozapine enters the breast milk of nursing mothers taking clozapine.

Conclusions: When weighing the risks and benefits of clozapine continuation during pregnancy and lactation versus switching to another antipsychotic, one should include severity of illness and treatment history but also be aware of the limitations of the available safety data regarding perinatal clozapine use, including the fact that there are few studies.

### Psychopharmacology in pregnancy and breastfeeding [^111wh8K6]. The Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

The use of psychotropic drugs during pregnancy and breastfeeding remains a controversial topic. There are several reasons for the controversy, ranging from the misperception that pregnancy is protective against mental illness, to the notion that women should be "pure" during pregnancy and avoid all extraneous substance use, and finally, to the stigma and misunderstanding of psychiatric illness and underestimation of how serious it can be. Fortunately, the currently available data are reassuring for most psychiatric medications-properly controlled studies indicate little to no risk for most (but not all) psychiatric medications.

### Postpartum psychosis: a proposed treatment algorithm [^111hxpq5]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). Medium credibility.

Antipsychotics

Antipsychotics are beneficial in the acute treatment of PPP. Second-generation antipsychotics, with the exception of clozapine, are relatively safe in breastfeeding. Olanzapine has the largest evidence base among antipsychotics in breastfeeding. Most of the evidence comes from a global safety surveillance report on olanzapine in breastfeeding by the pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly. Adverse events were reported in 15.6% of infants exposed to olanzapine through breast milk, with somnolence (4%), irritability (2%) and tremor (2%) being most commonly reported. Other smaller studies have reported a low relative infant dose for olanzapine and an absence of adverse effects in infants. With a low relative infant dose, quetiapine is also considered safe in breastfeeding. There are limited data on risperidone, and with a higher relative infant dose than olanzapine and quetiapine, use in breastfeeding should be considered with caution. Limited long-term follow-up data suggest normal development in infants exposed to olanzapine and quetiapine.

While antipsychotics are useful in the acute treatment of PPP and often preferred in clinical practice, only 50% of patients taking antipsychotic monotherapy have been found to remain in remission 9 months after the initial PPP episode. Antipsychotics used in conjunction with lithium have been reported to result in better outcomes.

### Perphenazine [^113cK2he]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Perphenazine products can lower the convulsive threshold in susceptible individuals; they should be used with caution in alcohol withdrawal and in patients with convulsive disorders. If the patient is being treated with an anticonvulsant agent, increased dosage of that agent may be required when perphenazine products are used concomitantly.

Perphenazine products should be used with caution in patients with psychic depression.

Perphenazine may impair the mental and/or physical abilities required for the performance of hazardous tasks such as driving a car or operating machinery; therefore, the patient should be warned accordingly.

Perphenazine products are not recommended for pediatric patients under 12 years of age.

Falls

Perphenazine tablets may cause somnolence, postural hypotension, motor and sensory instability, which may lead to falls and, consequently, fractures or other injuries. For patients with diseases, conditions, or medications that could exacerbate these effects, complete fall risk assessments when initiating antipsychotic treatment and recurrently for patients on long-term antipsychotic therapy.

Usage in Pregnancy: Non-teratogenic Effects

Neonates exposed to antipsychotic drugs, during the third trimester of pregnancy are at risk for extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms following delivery. There have been reports of agitation, hypertonia, hypotonia, tremor, somnolence, respiratory distress and feeding disorder in these neonates. These complications have varied in severity; while in some cases symptoms have been self-limited, in other cases neonates have required intensive care unit support and prolonged hospitalization.

Perphenazine should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.

Safe use of perphenazine during pregnancy and lactation has not been established; therefore, in administering the drug to pregnant patients,

nursing mothers, or women who may become pregnant, the possible benefits must be weighed against the possible hazards to mother and

child.

### Aripiprazole lauroxil (Aristada) [^112UZxmT]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

8.2 Lactation

Risk Summary

Aripiprazole is present in human breast milk. Based on published case reports and pharmacovigilance reports, aripiprazole exposure during pregnancy and/or the postpartum period may lead to clinically relevant decreases in milk supply which may be reversible with discontinuation of the drug. There are also reports of aripiprazole exposure during pregnancy and no maternal milk supply in the post-partum period. Effects on milk supply may be mediated through decreases in prolactin levels, which have been observed [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Monitor the breastfeed infant for dehydration and lack of appropriate weight gain. The development and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for ARISTADA and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from ARISTADA or from the underlying maternal condition.

8.4 Pediatric Use

Safety and effectiveness of ARISTADA in patients < 18 years of age have not been evaluated.

8.5 Geriatric Use

Safety and effectiveness of ARISTADA in patients > 65 years of age have not been evaluated.

Elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with antipsychotic drugs are at an increased risk of death. ARISTADA is not approved for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2)].

8.6 CYP2D6 Poor Metabolizers

Dosage adjustment is recommended in known CYP2D6 poor metabolizers due to high aripiprazole concentrations. Approximately 8% of Caucasians and 3–8% of Black/African Americans cannot metabolize CYP2D6 substrates and are classified as poor metabolizers (PM) [see Dosage and Administration (2.4), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

8.7 Hepatic and Renal Impairment

No dosage adjustment for ARISTADA is required based on a patient's hepatic function (mild to severe hepatic impairment, Child-Pugh score between 5 and 15), or renal function (mild to severe renal impairment, glomerular filtration rate between 15 and 90 mL/minute) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

8.8 Other Specific Populations

No dosage adjustment for ARISTADA is required on the basis of a patient's sex, race, or smoking status [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### Open-label study of the efficacy, safety and tolerability of brexanolone in the treatment of adult women with postpartum psychosis [^111uuC37]. General Hospital Psychiatry (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

Postpartum psychosis (PPP) is a rare but severe postpartum psychiatric emergency that occurs during a critical time in mother-infant attachment. This study investigated the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of brexanolone, a neuroactive steroid and synthetic form of allopregnanolone, for adult females with PPP.

Methods

In this open-label, proof-of-concept study, ten patients with PPP received brexanolone as a single, continuous, 60-h intravenous infusion titrated to a target dose of 90 μg/kg/h over a period of 2.5 days. Primary outcomes were change in total score on the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) and Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS); Secondary outcomes included change in Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) from baseline to Day 7. Adverse events were monitored. Patients were followed through Day 90.

Results

All ten patients completed the treatment protocol without dose reductions and without intolerable adverse side effects. Change in mean PANSS total score from baseline to Day 7 was statistically significant (p = 0.00006; 95% CI [19.60–38.40]), as were YMRS scores (p = 0.01; 95% CI [2.69–16.01]) and HAM-D scores (p = 0.0003; 95% CI [5.22–11.98]).

Conclusions

This study suggests the potential for neuroactive steroids as rapid-acting, adjunctive treatment for PPP and provides support for future research to assess the role of neuroactive steroids and synthetic forms of allopregnanolone in the treatment of PPP.

Decisions about the use of psychotropic medication in pregnancy are an ongoing challenge for clinicians and women with mental health problems, owing to the uncertainties around risks of the illness itself to mother and fetus/infant, effectiveness of medications in pregnancy and risks to the fetus/infant from in utero exposure or via breast milk. These consensus guidelines aim to provide pragmatic advice regarding these issues. They are divided into sections on risks of untreated illness in pregnancy; general principles of using drugs in the perinatal period; benefits and harms associated with individual drugs; and recommendations for the management of specific disorders.

### ABM clinical protocol # 18: use of antidepressants in breastfeeding mothers [^116tK8WY]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

ABM Clinical Protocol #18 — breastfeeding mothers using antidepressants — states that if a mother has previously responded to a specific selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, tricyclic antidepressant, or serotonin–norepinephrine uptake inhibitor, the data for that agent should be reviewed and it should be considered as a first-line treatment if there are no contraindications; mothers treated with these agents during pregnancy with good symptom control should continue on the same agent during breastfeeding, exposure in breastmilk is far less than during pregnancy, and ongoing treatment is critical for the health of both mother and baby. Mothers should be monitored carefully in the initial stages of treatment for changes, women with histories of bipolar disorder are at increased risk of depression, mania, or psychosis in the postpartum period, mothers and partners should be made aware of symptoms including increased insomnia, delusions, hallucinations, racing thoughts, and talking/moving fast, and women experiencing such symptoms should contact their physician immediately; mothers should also receive information on known and unknown risks and benefits to make an informed decision.

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^111xuY7F]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Recommendations for Patients with Co-occurring Psychiatric Disorders

24 Clinicians should optimize evidence-based treatment for any psychiatric disorder prior to the BZD taper or concurrently if clinically indicated (Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation).
25 Clinicians should strongly consider tapering BZD medication in patients with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD; Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation).
26 Clinicians should monitor sleep closely during BZD tapering in patients with mood or psychotic disorders, particularly for patients with bipolar disorder as sleep disturbance can trigger episodes of mania (Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation). a If patients with a mood and/or psychotic disorder experience significant sleep disturbance, clinicians should pause the taper until the symptoms resolve due to the risk of destabilization (Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation).

Recommendation for Older Adults

27 Clinicians should generally taper BZD medication in older adults unless there are compelling reasons for continuation (Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation).

Recommendations for Patients Who Are Pregnant or Lactating

28 Clinicians should weigh the risks and benefits for the maternal–fetal dyad when considering continued BZD prescribing or tapering for pregnant patients (Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation).
29 For infants who have been exposed to BZD in utero and are at risk of neonatal withdrawal, clinicians should: a Encourage breastfeeding, which can reduce neonatal withdrawal symptoms (Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation) b Communicate with the infant's healthcare provider (with parental consent) regarding exposure to BZDs (Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation)

### Non-psychotic mental disorders in the perinatal period [^111dojjs]. Lancet (2014). Excellent credibility.

Mental disorders are among the most common morbidities of pregnancy and the postnatal period, and can have adverse effects on the mother, her child, and family. This Series paper summarises the evidence about epidemiology, risk factors, identification, and interventions for non-psychotic mental disorders. Although the phenomenology and risk factors for perinatal mental disorders are largely similar to those for the disorders at other times, treatment considerations differ during pregnancy and breastfeeding. Most randomised controlled trials have examined psychosocial and psychological interventions for postnatal depression, with evidence for effectiveness in treating and preventing the disorder. Few high-quality studies exist on the effectiveness or safety of pharmacological treatments in the perinatal period, despite quite high prescription rates. General principles of prescribing of drugs in the perinatal period are provided, but individual risk-benefit analyses are needed for decisions about treatment.

### Maternal cariprazine exposure inhibits embryonic and postnatal brain cholesterol biosynthesis [^112rtPY9]. Molecular Psychiatry (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Cariprazine (CAR) (marketed under the name of Vraylar ®) is a novel antipsychotic, approved in 2015 for the treatment of adults with schizophrenia and manic or mixed episodes associated with bipolar I disorder. Based on Vraylar ® prescription information, CAR may cause fetal harm, and there are no adequate well-controlled studies in pregnant women. However, animal studies suggest potential risks to a fetus, and patients should be properly advised.

Although its complete mechanism of action is still not fully understood, the primary effect of CAR is mediated through a combination of activity at D 2 and D 3 receptors and 5-HT 1A receptors. CAR is also an antagonist at 5-HT 2A and 5-HT 2B receptors and binds to the H 1 receptors. CAR major metabolites, desmethyl-CAR (DCAR), and didesmethyl-CAR (DDCAR) are pharmacologically equipotent to CAR. DDCAR has been detected in the adult patients up to 12 weeks after discontinuation of CAR. In addition, CAR and aripiprazole (ARI), another atypical antipsychotic with a similar mechanism of action, are both metabolized to 2,3-(dichlorophenyl) piperazine (2,3-DCPP), which is an active and stable metabolite (Supplementary Fig. 1).

In addition to the actions of the G-protein coupled receptors, our previous studies revealed that both CAR and ARI are strong inhibitors of the 7-dehydrocholestrol reductase (DHCR7), the last enzyme in the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway. The common metabolite of CAR and ARI, 2,3-DCPP, inhibits the DHCR7 activity at concentrations comparable to those of the potent teratogen AY9944. This DHCR7 inhibition by ARI, CAR, and AY9944 results in the elevation of 7-dehydrocholesterol (7-DHC), which is unstable and can give rise to toxic metabolites. Previous studies from our group suggest that individuals with single-allele DHCR7 +/− mutations, who comprise ~1–3% of the human population, are particularly sensitive to 7-DHC elevating compounds, including ARI and trazodone.

### Postpartum psychosis: a proposed treatment algorithm [^1179vv3N]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Postpartum psychosis (PPP) is a severe mental disorder with a dramatic and rapid onset of affective and psychotic symptoms in the immediate postpartum period. PPP is a psychiatric emergency that generally warrants acute inpatient care. Due to its severe and fluctuating nature, there is a significant risk to the mother and infant if left untreated, with potential for the tragic consequences of suicide or infanticide. With maternal suicide being the leading cause of direct maternal death occurring within the first postpartum year, early detection and management of postpartum mental illness is key to improving outcomes for the mother and her infant. Evidence indicates that PPP is a disorder on the bipolar spectrum in women with a vulnerability to the childbirth trigger. Although PPP is a discrete disorder on the affective disorder spectrum with a distinctive treatment profile, it is yet to be recognised as a separate nosological entity in the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision and the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition. The primary aim of this review is to provide an evidence-based algorithm for the treatment of PPP, taking into account the unique management challenges during this vulnerable period for the mother–infant dyad.

### Postpartum psychosis: a proposed treatment algorithm [^113tJY8q]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). Medium credibility.

Inpatient admission

Admission to an inpatient setting is recommended for women with PPP. The mother and infant should not be left alone due to the rapidly changing and unpredictable nature of risk in PPP, with a kaleidoscopic picture of fluctuating mood and psychotic symptoms. MBU admissions, where available, are associated with better clinical outcomes, reduced time to recovery and improvement in maternal ability to care for the infant. Where an MBU is not available, admission to an inpatient mental health unit is recommended, although this will be disruptive to mother–infant bonding. In such cases, depending on a dynamic risk assessment, the patient may be provided supervised access to her infant. These meetings should take place in an appropriate room outside the mental health unit. In less severe cases of PPP where two trusted adults are available to care for the mother and infant, a decision may be made to treat the woman in the community, with daily multidisciplinary team reviews and support in the acute phase.

### Postpartum psychosis: a proposed treatment algorithm [^116Rck7q]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). Medium credibility.

Antidepressants

There are no studies examining the efficacy of antidepressants in episodes of PPP characterised by severe depression with psychotic features. Some women with PPP may experience depression in the post-acute phase. Antidepressants are routinely prescribed, although there are no studies examining the use of antidepressants in PPP. Depression following an episode of PPP should be treated as bipolar depression. There is evidence for benefit of quetiapine, lamotrigine, lurasidone and olanzapine in bipolar depression. If the woman is already on lithium for PPP, lithium levels should be checked. If antidepressants are considered in women with a history of PPP, they should be prescribed along with a drug for mania, and should be tapered and discontinued when full remission of depressive symptoms has been achieved.

Electroconvulsive therapy

Extant data suggest that the rapid treatment response following electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) may be beneficial in PPP. The response rate for ECT is reported to be higher in the postpartum period than outside this period. One study found lower rates of hospitalisation and suicidality in women with postpartum depression and PPP receiving ECT compared to women receiving ECT outside the perinatal period. A naturalistic study of 78 patients with PPP showed that 43.6% of these patients received ECT with good response. Indications for ECT in that study included augmentation to pharmacotherapy in treatment-resistant PPP (defined as minimal response to pharmacotherapy after 2 weeks), catatonia, and suicidal or infanticidal behaviour. In a case series of five women with postpartum affective disorders, two women had treatment-refractory PPP and showed rapid improvement in psychotic symptoms after three sessions of ECT.

Transient anterograde amnesia has been reported as an adverse effect of ECT in women with PPP. One study reported prolonged seizures which responded to treatment with barbiturates. Women receiving ECT can continue to breastfeed their infants with no adverse effects on the infant.

Although ECT is considered an option of last resort for treatment-resistant PPP in many healthcare systems, we recommend earlier consideration of ECT in women with severe symptoms, suicidal/infanticidal ideation, catatonia or severe agitation. ECT can be useful in these cases where rapid treatment response is required, and may lead to better outcomes for the mother–infant dyad.

### Management of bipolar disorder during pregnancy and the postpartum period [^111wWFNp]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

Bipolar disorder affects 0.5%-1.5% of individuals in the United States. The typical age at onset is late adolescence or early adulthood, placing women at risk for episodes throughout their reproductive years. General guidelines for the treatment of bipolar disorder are available from the American Psychiatric Association, but additional issues arise when these guidelines are applied in the treatment of peripartum women. The authors summarize knowledge regarding the management of bipolar disorder during pregnancy and the postpartum period, with a focus on managing mania, hypomania, and the psychotic components of the illness.

Method

An expert panel reviewed articles that address the management of bipolar disorder and the consequences of the use of mood stabilizers during pregnancy, and a consensus document was generated.

Results

The treatment of bipolar disorder in pregnant women involves significant challenges. Some mood stabilizers, e.g., sodium valproate and carbamazepine, are human teratogens. On the other hand, the teratogenicity associated with lithium may have been overestimated in the past.

Conclusions

Since treatment can be managed most effectively if pregnancy is planned, clinicians should discuss the issue of pregnancy and its management with every bipolar disorder patient who has childbearing potential, regardless of future reproductive plans. Additional research should address the risks of disturbed sleep to pregnant and postpartum women with bipolar disorder, as well as structural and behavioral consequences to offspring when mood stabilizers are used during pregnancy. Longitudinal and cohort studies can promote these efforts. Given the rate of bipolar disorder in the general population, research efforts will need to be broad based and include multiple collaborating centers.

### Adjunctive cariprazine as a novel effective strategy for treating major depressive disorder: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115ajDnr]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Cariprazine has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for treating bipolar depression and as an adjunctive treatment for Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). However, it remains unclear about its pharmacological efficacy in treating MDD. Therefore, a meta-analysis was conducted to investigate the adjunctive use of cariprazine in MDD.

Methods

Electronic databases were searched for eligible studies evaluating the efficacy and safety of cariprazine in patients with MDD up to November 15, 2023. The changes in Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) score and incidence of adverse events (AEs), which represents of efficacy and tolerability, are considered as the main outcomes.

Results

A total of 3066 patients with MDD included in all across 5 RCTs. With regard to MADRS score, cariprazine group showed better results than control group (SMD = -0.12, 95% CI -0.19 to -0.04, P = 0.002, 5 RCTs, n = 3066). Cariprazine, meanwhile, improved the MADRS response (RR = 1.19, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.31, P = 0.0004, 5 RCTs, n = 3066). For safety outcomes, statistical difference was observed in AEs (RR = 1.26, 95% CI 1.18 to 1.35, P < 0.00001, 5 RCTs, n = 3077). The suicide ideation and SAEs showed no statistical difference between two groups.

Conclusion

Cariprazine demonstrated antidepressant effect as an augmentation therapy in treating MDD. Meanwhile, the tolerability of it was acceptable as an adjunctive treatment. However, studies with larger sample sizes are still needed to explore the optimal dosage.

### A cautionary note on the use of antidepressants in postpartum depression [^115MC7fC]. Bipolar Disorders (2006). Low credibility.

Objectives

This paper discusses the effect of antidepressant use on the illness course in three women who were treated for first-onset postpartum depression (PPD) following childbirth.

Methods

A report of three cases of early-onset PPD in which bipolarity manifested following antidepressant treatment.

Results

There was no past history of psychiatric disturbance but in each case there was a family history of bipolar (BP) disorder. Treatment with antidepressants resulted in a highly unstable illness course characterized by a mixed episode, cycle acceleration, and a postpartum psychosis. However, discontinuation of antidepressants and institution of treatment with mood stabilizers and atypical neuroleptics resulted in sustained improvement and symptom remission.

Conclusions

Caution is urged in the use of antidepressants to treat early-onset PPD in women at risk for developing BP disorder due to a family history of bipolar illness.

2.5 Recommended Dosage for Adjunctive Therapy to Antidepressants for the Treatment of Major Depressive Disorder

The starting dosage of VRAYLAR is 1.5 mg orally once daily. Depending upon clinical response and tolerability, the dosage can be increased to 3 mg orally once daily on Day 15. In clinical trials, dosage titration at intervals of less than 14 days resulted in a higher incidence of adverse reactions [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Maximum recommended dosage is 3 mg orally once daily.

When the strong or moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor is discontinued, the VRAYLAR dosage may need to be increased based on clinical response and tolerability [see Drug Interactions (7)].

Dosage Modifications for Patients Concomitantly Taking VRAYLAR with CYP3A4 Inducers

Concomitant use of VRAYLAR and a CYP3A4 inducer has not been evaluated and is not recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.1), Warnings and Precautions (5.6), Drug Interactions (7), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

2.7 Treatment Discontinuation

Following discontinuation of VRAYLAR, the decline in plasma concentrations of active drug and metabolites may not be immediately reflected in patients' clinical symptoms; the plasma concentration of cariprazine and its active metabolites will decline by 50% in ~1 week [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. There are no systematically collected data to specifically address switching patients from VRAYLAR to other antipsychotics or concerning concomitant administration with other antipsychotics.

### Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) and International Society for Bipolar Disorders (ISBD) 2018 guidelines for the management of patients with bipolar disorder [^111E4z4F]. Bipolar Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

Patients should be encouraged to initiate or optimize maintenance treatment as soon after giving birth as possible, with preference given to medications that have previously been shown to be successful. Near delivery, close monitoring is essential for early detection and management of symptoms that might signal onset of a mood or psychotic episode. 538 If an acute mood episode emerges in the postpartum period, the hierarchies for non‐postpartum episodes should be followed, but, because most psychotropic medications are excreted in breast milk, treatment choice should take into consideration safety in breastfeeding when applicable.

The FDA website mentioned in the previous section as well as Table 21 also include information on lactation. The FDA PLLR should be consulted for further information about medication risks, as many are secreted in milk, if breastfeeding is being considered.

The potential risks and benefits of taking medications while breastfeeding should be discussed with the patient. Education about early recognition of drug toxicity and requirement for ongoing monitoring of infants is also critical. 539 A recent systematic review suggested quetiapine and olanzapine as preferred choices for breastfeeding, considering their relatively lower infant dosages. 540 The impact of medication on the infant can be reduced by scheduling medication administration after breastfeeding. 541

Replacing or supplementing breast milk with formula can also be considered. Although there are many benefits to breastfeeding, associated sleep disruption may increase the risk of mood episodes in women with BD. If possible, bottle feeding at night by the woman's partner or a support can be beneficial to allow the woman to maintain a better sleeping schedule. In women with postpartum psychosis or mania, breastfeeding may be more risky, and therefore may not be indicated, as the mother may be too disorganized to safely breastfeed. 542

As childbirth can be a trigger for first onset of hypomania/mania in women with MDD, antidepressants should be used cautiously, especially in women with a family history of BD. 543 Women with first onset of depression in the postpartum period or those who have recurrence of depression during the early postpartum period, may also be at a high risk of switching to BD following treatment with antidepressants. 537

### A clinical review of the use of common psychiatric medications in pregnancy: guidelines for obstetrical providers [^111wPC2L]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2023). Medium credibility.

Psychotropic medications are commonly prescribed in pregnancy, and obstetrical providers should be informed about how and when to use them. The current narrative review addresses the use of some of the most commonly prescribed psychotropic medications-antidepressants, sedatives and hypnotics, and antipsychotic drugs. The aim is neither a complete review of psychiatric disorders in pregnancy nor all possible psychological and pharmacological treatments for mental illness around the time of pregnancy. Rather, the focus is on therapeutic considerations for general obstetrical providers.

### Postpartum psychosis in a non-native language-speaking patient: a perspective on language barriers and cultural competency [^116n4ucx]. General Psychiatry (2019). Medium credibility.

With the language barrier contributing to the lack of clear, definitive signs for PP, Ms. K was initially started on sertraline (Zoloft) 50 mg (increased to 75 mg the following day), lorazepam (Ativan) 0.5 mg and zolpidem (Ambien) 5 mg, with the instructions for staff to monitor for signs of overt psychosis. Levothyroxine 75 µg daily was continued for hypothyroidism. Minimal improvement occurred from hospital days 1 to 3 and her family was advised that she would need to stay for several days to ensure that her symptoms improve and that she would not be a danger to herself or others. On hospital day 3, she suddenly admitted to an on-site Japanese-speaking staff member that she was hearing indistinct voices, in which the attending was contacted and aripriprazole (Abilify) 5 mg was immediately started. Her mood and negative symptoms rapidly stabilised over the following days, which ultimately confirmed diagnosis of postpartum psychosis. She was discharged on hospital day 6 with outpatient follow-up with Japanese-speaking psychiatrists and therapists.

Pharmacological treatment in the acute phase

Pharmacological management is the mainstay of acute treatment for PPP (Figure 1). However, there is limited evidence available for the safety of medications in the perinatal period. Concerns about foetal and neonatal safety have led to the exclusion of pregnant and breastfeeding women from clinical drug trials since the thalidomide tragedy in the 1960s. During the perinatal period, women are often required to consider the ethical implications of medication use without robust safety data. Recent ethical guidelines for clinical trials advocate for the inclusion of pregnant and breastfeeding women in clinical trials, promoting studies designed to obtain knowledge relevant to the health needs of these women, undertaken after careful consideration of the best available data. With these recent changes, there is hope for more robust safety and efficacy data in the future for medications in the perinatal period. Current recommendations, however, are based on prospective clinical cohorts, retrospective studies, surveillance data and case reports.

Helpful resources on the use of psychotropic medication postpartum include the BAP consensus guidance on the use of psychotropic medication in pregnancy and postpartum and the NICE guideline on antenatal and postnatal mental health. Decisions regarding medication use in the perinatal period must be made following a full individual risk/benefit analysis, including an evaluation of the risks and benefits of accepting treatment and the risks of untreated mental illness to the mother–infant dyad.

Benzodiazepines and hypnotics

As insomnia can lead to deterioration of symptoms in PPP, adequate sleep is of primary importance. Hypnotics and benzodiazepines may be used to treat insomnia and agitation. Low doses of benzodiazepines with a short half-life and no active metabolites are recommended in breastfeeding. Lorazepam is not thought to cause any adverse effects in breastfeeding infants and is the preferred benzodiazepine in breastfeeding mothers. Promethazine is often used in clinical practice, but there are no studies examining promethazine in PPP. Promethazine can lower basal prolactin secretion and may interfere with the establishment of lactation in the early postpartum period.

There is limited data on zolpidem safety in breastfeeding, but with low levels in breast milk and a short half-life, infant adverse effects are thought to be unlikely. There is no safety data on zopiclone in breastfeeding. Breastfed infants should be monitored for sedation, hypotonia and respiratory depression, particularly with regular use of large doses of hypnotics.

### Adverse events in a breastfed infant exposed to risperidone and haloperidol [^113em6qr]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Schizophrenia and related psychoses are characterized by high recurrence rates and a serious impact on social functions. Many patients with these conditions, therefore, require prophylactic treatment during the postpartum period. Antipsychotic medication is the main treatment strategy for these disorders. Compared with single use of antipsychotics, data on the safety of combined antipsychotics on the breastfed infants are very limited. The current report presents adverse events in an infant exposed to a combination of risperidone and haloperidol through breast milk.

Supporting rationale states that "the confidence in the quality of evidence was very low", that "The benefits and harms, burdens, or both associated with the augmentation of non-antipsychotic medications in the treatment of cognitive and negative symptoms was balanced", and that "Patient preferences varied for certain medications" with "Patient values and preferences varied somewhat because of differing medication preferences". Subgroup considerations include "individuals with seizures, pregnant or lactating women, and differences in effect on acute versus chronic schizophrenia", and limitations include "a small number of studies, significant attrition rates, risk of allocation concealment, and incomplete outcome data".

### Risk of postpartum relapse in bipolar disorder and postpartum psychosis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^117Sw9Wd]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

Women with a history of bipolar disorder, postpartum psychosis, or both are at high risk for postpartum relapse. The aim of this meta-analysis was to estimate the risk of postpartum relapse in these three patient groups.

Method

A systematic literature search was conducted in all public medical electronic databases, adhering to the PRISMA guidelines. Studies were included if they reported postpartum relapse in patients diagnosed with bipolar disorder and/or a history of postpartum psychosis or mania according to DSM or ICD criteria or the Research Diagnostic Criteria.

Results

Thirty-seven articles describing 5,700 deliveries in 4,023 patients were included in the quantitative analyses. The overall postpartum relapse risk was 35% (95% CI = 29, 41). Patients with bipolar disorder were significantly less likely to experience severe episodes postpartum (17%, 95% CI = 13, 21) than patients with a history of postpartum psychosis (29%, 95% CI = 20, 41). Insufficient information was available to determine relapse rates for patients with bipolar disorder and a history of postpartum episodes. In women with bipolar disorder, postpartum relapse rates were significantly higher among those who were medication free during pregnancy (66%, 95% CI = 57, 75) than those who used prophylactic medication (23%, 95% CI = 14, 37).

Conclusions

One-third of women at high risk experience a postpartum relapse. In women with bipolar disorder, continuation of prophylactic medication during pregnancy appears highly protective for maintaining mood stability postpartum. In women with a history of isolated postpartum psychosis, initiation of prophylaxis immediately after delivery offers the opportunity to minimize the risk of relapse while avoiding in utero medication exposure.

### Postpartum psychosis: a proposed treatment algorithm [^113spB2W]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). Medium credibility.

Breastfeeding

The risks and benefits to the mother–infant dyad have to be considered when breastfeeding recommendations are made in PPP. Although breastfeeding is recommended where possible, we argue that in PPP, the risks of breastfeeding to the mother–infant dyad may often outweigh the benefits. Sleep deprivation is common in breastfeeding women and can lead to deterioration of symptoms in PPP. The choice of medications that may be used to treat PPP is limited in breastfeeding (e.g. lithium, with the best evidence base for treatment of PPP, is a relative contraindication to breastfeeding in many healthcare systems). Please see section 'Lithium and other mood stabilisers' for further discussion of lithium and breastfeeding), with additional constraints on doses of medications that may be used. The resulting inadequate treatment of PPP combined with the perpetuating effect of sleep deprivation can prolong the episode of PPP, further impacting the mother–infant dyad.

We acknowledge that in certain situations, such as low- and middle-income countries, formula feeding may not be feasible due to the costs of infant formula and hygiene concerns with bottles. Breast milk is vital for the development of preterm infants and the use of a breast milk bank where available might be considered in this circumstance. Occasionally, when the prescribed medication is safe in breastfeeding, daytime breastfeeding may be supplemented by nocturnal formula feeds offered by the partner or carer to facilitate maternal sleep. Reference to the latest guidance on medications in breastfeeding is recommended before prescribing. There is limited long-term safety data for psychotropic medication in breastfeeding. Information on the levels of individual drugs in breast milk and infant blood and the possible adverse effects in the breastfeeding infant may be found, in databases such as the Drugs and Lactation Database (LactMed).

### The impact of postpartum psychosis on partners [^112bVSiQ]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Postpartum Psychosis is a severe mental health condition following childbirth, with a psychosis and associated mood disturbance. Research to date has primarily focused on mothers' experiences, and on identifying risk factors, aetiology, and intervention efficacy. Within both research and clinical communities, there has been little acknowledgement of partners' experiences of Postpartum Psychosis, nor the important support role that partners can provide. The aim of this study was to consider the lived experiences of partners of women who have had Postpartum Psychosis, and the impact that it has had on their lives and relationships.

Methods

Participants (N = 8) were partners recruited through the charity Action on Postpartum Psychosis. Partners completed an in-depth, semi-structured interview regarding their experiences of Postpartum Psychosis. Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis was used to analyse the interview transcripts.

Results

Seven superordinate themes emerged from the interview data: loss; powerlessness; united vs. individual coping; hypothesising and hindsight; barriers to accessing care and unmet needs; managing multiple roles; and positive changes from Postpartum Psychosis.

Conclusions

These findings provide a rich illustration of the experiences of partners, including some previously unidentified findings relating to partner hypervigilance to signs of relapse and positive changes in their attitudes and relationships. Areas where support could be provided for partners are also highlighted.

### Treatment and management of mental health conditions during pregnancy and postpartum: ACOG clinical practice guideline no. 5 [^115miC3F]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To assess the evidence regarding safety and efficacy of psychiatric medications to treat mental health conditions during pregnancy and lactation. The conditions reviewed include depression, anxiety and anxiety-related disorders, bipolar disorder, and acute psychosis. For information on screening and diagnosis, refer to American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) Clinical Practice Guideline Number 4, "Screening and Diagnosis of Mental Health Conditions During Pregnancy and Postpartum" (1).

Target Population

Pregnant or postpartum individuals with mental health conditions with onset that may have predated the perinatal period or may have occurred for the first time in pregnancy or the first year postpartum or may have been exacerbated in that time.

Methods

This guideline was developed using an a priori protocol in conjunction with a writing team consisting of one specialist in obstetrics and gynecology and one maternal-fetal medicine subspecialist appointed by the ACOG Committee on Clinical Practice Guidelines-Obstetrics and two external subject matter experts. ACOG medical librarians completed a comprehensive literature search for primary literature within Cochrane Library, Cochrane Collaboration Registry of Controlled Trials, EMBASE, PubMed, and MEDLINE. Studies that moved forward to the full-text screening stage were assessed by two authors from the writing team based on standardized inclusion and exclusion criteria. Included studies underwent quality assessment, and a modified GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) evidence-to-decision framework was applied to interpret and translate the evidence into recommendation statements.

Recommendations

This Clinical Practice Guideline includes recommendations on treatment and management of perinatal mental health conditions including depression, anxiety, bipolar disorders, and acute postpartum psychosis, with a focus on psychopharmacotherapy. Recommendations are classified by strength and evidence quality. Ungraded Good Practice Points are included to provide guidance when a formal recommendation could not be made because of inadequate or nonexistent evidence.

### Cariprazine (Vraylar) [^112MDAJC]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

8.5 Geriatric Use

Clinical trials of VRAYLAR did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 and older to determine whether or not they respond differently from younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.

Antipsychotic drugs increase the risk of death in elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis. VRAYLAR is not approved for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis [see Boxed Warning and Warning s and Precautions (5.1, 5.3)].

8.6 Hepatic Impairment

No dosage adjustment for VRAYLAR is required in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score between 5 and 9) [see C linical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Usage of VRAYLAR is not recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score between 10 and 15). VRAYLAR has not been evaluated in this patient population.

8.7 Renal Impairment

No dosage adjustment for VRAYLAR is required in patients with mild to moderate (CrCL ≥ 30 mL/minute) renal impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Usage of VRAYLAR is not recommended in patients with severe renal impairment (CrCL < 30 mL/minute). VRAYLAR has not been evaluated in this patient population.

8.8 Smoking

No dosage adjustment for VRAYLAR is needed for patients who smoke. VRAYLAR is not a substrate for CYP1A2; smoking is not expected to have an effect on the pharmacokinetics of VRAYLAR.

8.9 Other Specific Populations

No dosage adjustment is required based on patient's age, sex, or race. These factors do not affect the pharmacokinetics of VRAYLAR [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Major depressive disorder — second-generation antipsychotic (SGA) augmentation states that augmentation with an SGA may also be considered after partial or no response to pharmacotherapy; three atypical antipsychotics are FDA-approved as adjunctive treatment/augmentation (aripiprazole, brexpiprazole, quetiapine-XR), and olanzapine is approved only when used with fluoxetine for acute treatment-resistant MDD, while olanzapine by itself is not indicated; other SGAs such as cariprazine and risperidone are used off-label. Three systematic reviews have demonstrated significant benefit of SGAs (alone or augmentation) for remission in MDD, including significant improvement with aripiprazole (mean doses = 11 − 12 mg/day), olanzapine (mean doses = 8 − 14 mg/day), quetiapine (mean doses = 180 mg/day), and risperidone (mean doses = 1.2 − 1.6 mg/day); additional evidence showed small significant benefit favoring augmentation with atypical antipsychotics and significant improvement in depressive symptoms with SGAs, although risperidone augmentation did not differentiate from placebo augmentation.

The perinatal period

The only systematic study of catatonia in the perinatal period is a retrospective chart review of 200 women consecutively admitted to hospital with postpartum psychosis, which suggests that the condition may be prevalent in women with severe mental illness in the postnatal period: 40 women (20%) were assessed as having catatonic signs. The literature in other perinatal groups with psychiatric or medical illnesses does not allow prevalence estimates.

In pregnancy, many potential complications of persistent catatonia place the mother and child at exceptionally high risk. These include venous thrombosis and thromboembolism, dehydration, malnutrition, incontinence, infections, communication difficulties, impaired co-operation with assessments and investigations, and impairment of capacity. Postnatally, the mother's ability to breastfeed and to care and bond with her infant are key concerns.

The sections that follow describe the risks that the two main treatments for catatonia, lorazepam and ECT, may pose to the mother and the child. More details about the general principles of use of psychotropic medications in the perinatal period may be found in the BAP guidance on this topic

The reproductive safety of lorazepam in the perinatal period

Research on the reproductive safety of benzodiazepines remains at an early stage, and studies more typically evaluate benzodiazepines as a group, rather than individual agents. In a meta-analysis of cohort studies of exposure to benzodiazepines, found a trend towards increased risks for total (n = 5195) and cardiovascular (n = 4414) malformations with the lower end of the 95% CI nearly achieving significance.reported in a nationwide cohort study of 3.1 million pregnancies with a larger sample of benzodiazepine exposures (n = 40,846), using propensity scores to account for a large number of potential confounders and several sensitivity analyses, that first trimester exposure to benzodiazepines was associated with a very small increased risk of overall congenital malformations (adjusted relative risk (aRR): 1.09; 95% CI: 1.05–1.13) and specifically, heart defects (adjusted RR: 1.15; 95% CI: 1.10–1.21). A risk of oral clefts, reported by several previous studies, was not confirmed. There were differences between compounds and lorazepam was not associated with significant effects (aRR for overall congenital malformations 1.00, CI: 0.85–1.18; aRR for cardiovascular malformations 1.14, CI: 0.93–1.40).

### Effect of zuranolone vs placebo in postpartum depression: a randomized clinical trial [^114rtJw6]. JAMA Psychiatry (2021). High credibility.

Methods

Study Design and Participants

Patients were screened at 33 centers in the US (first informed consent, January 4, 2017; final poststudy observation, December 11, 2018), with 27 sites randomizing and dosing at least 1 patient. The trial received institutional review board approval and was performed in accordance with ethical principles originating in the Declaration of Helsinkiand are consistent with International Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use and Good Clinical Practice guidelines and all applicable regulatory requirements. All patients provided written informed consent prior to enrollment. The trial was completed on reaching predetermined target enrollment numbers.

Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria

Adult ambulatory female patients, aged 18 to 45 years old, 6 months or less post partum, with a major depressive episode without psychosis (diagnosed by the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-5 Axis I Disorders for clinical trials)that began no earlier than the third trimester and no later than the first 4 weeks following delivery, were enrolled. This PPD definition was used in previous clinical trials. A baseline 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD-17) score of 26 or higher was required. Patients taking psychotropic medications used to treat depressive symptoms were required to have been taking a stable dose for more than 30 days prior to day 1 and delay the start/alteration of psychotropic treatment regimens until after the treatment period and day 15 assessments were completed. Patients must have ceased lactating at screening or agreed to cease breastfeeding from just prior to receiving the study drug until 7 days after the last dose. Race/ethnicity was self-reported by patients, or the data were pulled from external medical records, if available. The principal investigator at each site was responsible for recruitment and enrollment of patients. The trial protocol, which contains additional inclusion and full exclusion criteria, is available in Supplement 1.

### Postpartum psychosis: a proposed treatment algorithm [^112NdtFf]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). Medium credibility.

Duration of pharmacological treatment

There are no available data on the appropriate duration of treatment for an episode of PPP. The BAP consensus guidelines on using psychotropic medication in pregnancy and postpartum recommend following BAP or NICE guidelines for non-perinatal episodes of mania. The BAP guideline for bipolar disorder recommends a minimum duration of 12 weeks for the short-term treatment of mania and recommends long-term treatment following a single severe episode of mania. NICE guidelines for bipolar disorder recommend reviewing the need for long-term treatment after 3–6 months of treatment for acute mania. The evidence-based UpToDate resource on the treatment of PPP recommends treating women for at least 1 year postpartum to reduce the risk of relapse, with a suggestion that some patients may require lifetime prophylaxis if there is risk of relapse without medication or in the presence of other risk factors such as suicidality.

Prognosis

A meta-analysis (of studies from 1949 to 1995) of long-term outcomes for women with PPP found that 40% had an isolated episode of PPP while 60% had a subsequent non-puerperal episode of mental illness during the follow-up period of 11–16 years. The majority of women (88%) in one study had returned to premorbid levels of functioning by nine months postpartum following PPP. More recently, a prospective longitudinal study examined 106 women with first-onset mania or psychosis in the postpartum period. In the 4-year follow-up period, 68% of women did not experience recurrence outside the postpartum period, with just 2% experiencing a recurrence exclusively following later pregnancies. Notably, the majority of women in this study were treated with lithium (76%) and antipsychotics (83%) during their MBU admission. In the same study, 32% of women experienced a relapse outside the postpartum period during the 4-year follow-up. Patients with a shorter duration of PPP have a more favourable prognosis, and a longer duration between index PPP and subsequent pregnancy predicts a further episode of PPP. A first episode of PPP also has a more favourable prognosis compared to a first episode of an affective disorder outside the perinatal period.

### Visualizing classification of drugs used in psychotic disorders: A' subway map' representing mechanisms, established classes and informal categories [^117CqLRa]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2022). Medium credibility.

Two pairs of drugs were found to be very closely related; zuclopenthixol/clopenthixol which contain the same cis isomers but differ in the presence or ratio of the trans-isomer, and risperidone/paliperidone – the latter being a hydroxy metabolite of the former.

The map provides information for the 27 more widely available drugs on additional serotonergic, alpha-adrenergic, histaminergic and cholinergic receptor affinities by virtue of the symbols adjacent to each station disc. Where data exist in PDSP (or additional sources as described in the Methods), affinity stronger than a Ki threshold of 1000 nM is indicated by triangles of increasing size depending on the magnitude of affinity. There were a small number of examples of inverse agonists: cariprazine at the 5HT2C receptor and potentially pimavanserin at both 5HT2A and 5HT2C receptors. We chose to highlight the D3 partial agonist action of cariprazine with a distinctive symbol as the 10-fold greater affinity of the D3 receptor over the D2 is unique to this drug and may be essential understanding its therapeutic action.

We encountered a small number of situations whereby the evolution of receptor nomenclature generated issues in ascertaining the data on receptor affinities. For levomepromazine and zuclopenthixol, data listed as relating to '5HT2' were assumed to relate to 5HT2A as the modern nomenclature of 5HT2A, 5HT2C and other 5HT2 subtypes had not yet been adopted at the time of publication of papers providing affinity data, the '5HT2' receptors described in that era subsequently being relabelled '5HT2A'. For aripiprazole, brexpiprazole and lurasidone, no data for alpha 2 adrenoceptor affinity were listed in the PDSP database. For each drug, however, there were several studies yielding data for one or more related receptor subtypes, that is, alpha 2A, 2B and/or 2C receptors. We therefore took the median value of Ki values across all three of these receptor subtypes to ascertain the value for alpha 2 for aripiprazole, and across the alpha 2A and 2C values available for lurasidone, while for brexpiprazole we used the value for alpha 2C receptors which was the only receptor subtype which had data available in PDSP. We noted a small disparity between PDSP data listed for lurasidone and the original data in the corresponding cited publication for 5HT2A and H1 affinities, and chose to use the source data from the paper.

### Treatment of psychosis and mania in the postpartum period [^112MsYwc]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2015). Low credibility.

Postpartum psychosis is a severe disorder that warrants acute clinical intervention. Little is known, however, about what interventions are most effective. The authors present treatment response and remission outcomes at 9 months postpartum using a four-step algorithm in patients with first-onset psychosis or mania in the postpartum period. Treatment involved the structured sequential administration of benzodiazepines, antipsychotics, lithium, and ECT. The outcome of clinical remission was examined in 64 women consecutively admitted for postpartum psychosis. Remission was defined as the absence of psychotic, manic, and severe depressive symptoms for at least 1 week. Women who remitted on antipsychotic monotherapy were advised to continue this treatment as maintenance therapy, and women who required both antipsychotics and lithium to achieve remission were maintained on lithium monotherapy. Relapse was defined as the occurrence of any mood or psychotic episode fulfilling DSM-IV-TR criteria. Using this treatment algorithm, the authors observed that nearly all patients (98.4%) achieved complete remission within the first three steps. None of the patients required ECT. At 9 months postpartum, sustained remission was observed in 79.7%. Patients treated with lithium had a significantly lower rate of relapse compared with those treated with antipsychotic monotherapy. Multiparity and nonaffective psychosis were identified as risk factors for relapse. The authors conclude that a structured treatment algorithm with the sequential addition of benzodiazepines, antipsychotics, and lithium may result in high rates of remission in patients with first-onset postpartum psychosis and that lithium maintenance may be most beneficial for relapse prevention.

### Postpartum catatonia treated with electroconvulsive therapy: a case report [^116Pn8aT]. General Hospital Psychiatry (2012). Low credibility.

Catatonia is a rare syndrome that occurs in mood and psychotic disorders, and general medical conditions. Postpartum depression affects 10%-15% of women within 6 months after delivery. Postpartum psychosis affects 0.1%-0.5% of women within weeks after delivery, though it can occur within hours; it carries risk for suicide and infanticide. There is limited evidence available to guide treatment. We review a case of postpartum psychosis that presented with catatonia and was resistant to medications, but responded to electroconvulsive therapy.

4.4 Implications for clinical practice

For women with mood disorders, particularly for those with bipolar disorder, difficult decisions need to be made in relation to pregnancy and childbirth. Any information that can help to individualize the risk of illness may be useful. For women with BD-I, the odds of postpartum psychosis following a first pregnancy are double those for further deliveries. If a woman has remained well after their first baby, this provides some reassurance in subsequent pregnancies. However, it is important to remember that the risk of postpartum recurrence is very high (> 60%) in women who have already experienced an episode of postpartum psychosis.

### Prevention of postpartum psychosis and mania in women at high risk [^113sStNL]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

Women with a history of bipolar disorder or postpartum psychosis are at extremely high risk of relapse postpartum. Although lithium prophylaxis has demonstrated efficacy in reducing postpartum relapse, the timing of prophylaxis remains controversial given the balance of risks and benefits for the mother and fetus. The authors compared lithium use during pregnancy to its initiation postpartum in women at high risk for postpartum psychosis.

Method

Between 2003 and 2010, 70 pregnant women at high risk for postpartum psychosis were referred to the authors' psychiatric outpatient clinic. Women who were initially medication free were advised to start lithium prophylaxis immediately postpartum. Women already taking maintenance lithium during pregnancy were advised to continue treatment.

Results

All women with a history of psychosis limited to the postpartum period (N = 29) remained stable throughout pregnancy despite being medication free. Of the women with bipolar disorder (N = 41), 24.4% relapsed during pregnancy, despite prophylaxis use by the majority throughout pregnancy. The postpartum relapse rate was highest in women with bipolar disorder who experienced mood episodes during pregnancy (60.0%). In contrast, none of the 20 women with a history of postpartum psychosis only who used postpartum prophylaxis relapsed, compared to 44.4% of patients with postpartum psychosis only who declined prophylaxis.

Conclusions

The authors recommend initiating prophylactic treatment immediately postpartum in women with a history of psychosis limited to the postpartum period, to avoid in utero fetal exposure to medication. Patients with bipolar disorder require continuous prophylaxis throughout pregnancy and the postpartum period to reduce peripartum relapse risk.

### Postpartum psychosis [^113cN3es]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Postpartum psychosis is a psychiatric emergency that can affect the health and life of mothers, infants, and families. Postpartum psychosis (PPP) is distinct from non-postpartum psychosis in many ways, and it is crucial to study and understand PPP to identify, treat, and possibly prevent this condition. We therefore sought to review the latest research findings about PPP with the intention of updating readers about the latest evidence base.

Recent Findings

Multiple physiologic pathways have been implicated in the development of PPP, and further understanding these pathways may allow for early detection and treatment. Risk assessment and treatment should include consideration of the woman patient but also the mother-infant dyad and the larger family. It is our hope that this review of research updates in postpartum psychosis may inform clinical practice and promote specialized, evidence-based diagnosis, risk assessment, and treatment.

### Bipolar II postpartum depression: detection, diagnosis, and treatment [^1116RxVQ]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2009). Low credibility.

Research on postpartum mood disorders has focused primarily on major depressive disorder, bipolar I disorder, and puerperal psychosis and has largely ignored or neglected bipolar II disorder. Hypomanic symptoms are common after delivery but frequently unrecognized. DSM-IV does not consider early postpartum hypomania as a significant diagnostic feature. Although postpartum hypomania may not cause marked impairment in social or occupational functioning, it is often associated with subsequent, often disabling depression. Preliminary evidence suggests that bipolar II depression arising in the postpartum period is often misdiagnosed as unipolar major depressive disorder. The consequences of the misdiagnosis can be particularly serious because of delayed initiation of appropriate treatment and the inappropriate prescription of antidepressants. Moreover, no pharmacological or psychotherapeutic studies of bipolar postpartum depression are available to guide clinical decision making. Also lacking are screening instruments designed specifically for use before or after delivery in women with suspected bipolar depression. It is recommended that the treatment of postpartum bipolar depression follow the same guidelines as the treatment of nonpuerperal bipolar II depression, using medications that are compatible with lactation.

### Antipsychotic medication for women with schizophrenia spectrum disorders [^116YLo5r]. Psychological Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Women tend to have slower drug absorption, distribution, metabolism and elimination rates, resulting in higher plasma levels and bioavailability of most antipsychotic medications. Since oestrogens induce dopamine sensitivity in the brain, the efficacy of antipsychotics is enhanced in premenopausal women, compared to men. Considering that current treatment guidelines are mostly based on data from men, women are likely to be overmedicated and it is therefore not surprising that adverse events are much more common in women. Additionally, women are more vulnerable to many side-effects, such as weight gain, EPS and hyperprolactinaemia, independently of dose. Defining the minimum effective dose in women is of utmost importance, as the risk of overmedicating increases when female sex hormone levels are high, specifically during ovulation and in the later stages of pregnancy. Conversely, effective doses of most antipsychotics (quetiapine and lurasidone are exceptions) may need to be increased during low-hormonal phases in life, specifically post-natal, during menstruation and during and after menopause. Optimal antipsychotic treatment for women is highly dependent on the different life phases. Premenopausal women should be prescribed lower dosages for most antipsychotics (except for quetiapine and lurasidone). During pregnancy, the most reasonable and less harmful choice appears to be maintaining future mothers with SSD at the minimum effective dosage of the drug they were already using before pregnancy. If a medication-free pregnancy is feasible, this is of course the best option. Clozapine should probably be avoided during breastfeeding and while further safety data on other antipsychotics are limited, the inherent benefits of breastfeeding for mother and baby should be balanced carefully against the potential risks for the baby. Postmenopausal women represent a group of patients that is especially vulnerable to side-effects associated with ageing and declining hormone levels such as osteoporosis and CVD, and for these women, oestrogen replacement therapy should be considered to ameliorate both somatic and mental health problems, although the increased risk for thrombosis also needs to be taken into account.

### ABM clinical protocol # 18: use of antidepressants in breastfeeding mothers [^112EfvH3]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Postpartum psychosis — incidence and risk in the postpartum period are characterized as follows: it can occur in one to three of every 1,000 deliveries and usually has a rapid onset (within hours to a few weeks) after delivery, and approximately 25–50% of women with bipolar disorder are at risk of developing postpartum psychosis; women may have a prior history of postpartum psychosis or bipolar disorder, but some have no prior psychiatric history.

### Infant safety with antipsychotic therapy in breast-feeding: a systematic review [^114vmhBJ]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2008). Low credibility.

Background

A relatively high number of women may suffer from psychotic symptoms at postpartum onset. Such symptoms may have devastating effects not only on the mothers but also on the later infant's well being. Children born to mothers with psychosis are at increased risk of physiologic, psychological, and personality development disturbance, whereas children born to mothers with bipolar disorder are at increased risk of early-onset psychiatric disorders. Hence, clinicians should consider it imperative to prevent or manage effectively psychotic and affective relapses in new mothers.

Objectives

To analyze the literature for information about the safety of first- and second-generation antipsychotics for breast-fed infants in order to individuate the safest treatment option for women who need such medications during puerperium.

Data Sources

A computerized search was carried out on MEDLINE/PubMed/TOXNET (1950-January 2008). The following key words were used: breast-feeding, lactation, puerperium, psychotropic drugs, atypical antipsychotics, typical antipsychotics, and neuroleptics.

Conclusions

No conclusions can be drawn about the risk/benefit profile of the majority of antipsychotic medications in breast-feeding. Hence, when clinicians are forced to start antipsychotic treatment in drug-naive patients, the choice of the safest option should be based on the general effectiveness profile of each agent, with 2 possible exceptions: clozapine (the drug should be considered contraindicated during breast-feeding because of its liability of inducing potential life-threatening events in the infant), and olanzapine (the drug seems to be associated with an increased risk of inducing extrapyramidal reactions in the breast-fed babies). Conversely, in patients who need to continue antipsychotic therapy during breast-feeding, it is suitable to maintain the previous pharmacologic regimen, if known as effective.

### Efficacy and safety of cariprazine in bipolar I depression: a double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 study [^116RbBEb]. Bipolar Disorders (2020). Medium credibility.

Pharmacological agents currently approved by the FDA for treatment of acute bipolar I depression include quetiapine, 11 olanzapine/fluoxetine combination, 13 lurasidone, 12 and cariprazine, 14 but notably not all atypical antipsychotics have demonstrated efficacy in treatment of bipolar I depression compared with placebo (eg, aripiprazole 48 and ziprasidone). 45 The differential efficacy of approved agents and cariprazine with aripiprazole and ziprasidone may be explained by distinct mechanisms of action for different class members. Interestingly, studies have reported weight gain and metabolic abnormalities associated with quetiapine and olanzapine, but cariprazine, like lurasidone, 37 demonstrated a low propensity for these complications in the current and previous studies. 22, 23 Cariprazine‐treated patients in this study had a mean weight increase of 0.5 kg or less from baseline, and less than 2% of patients experienced a weight gain ≥ 7% of their body weight. Metabolic parameters and shifts into abnormal range were small and not judged to be clinically relevant. Mean fasting serum glucose level changes from baseline were increased with cariprazine treatment compared to placebo, but due to the large overlapping standard deviations are not believed to be clinically significant. The overall metabolic results are particularly significant in this patient population because bipolar I disorder and treatment with atypical antipsychotics both increase the risk of comorbid physical conditions including being clinically overweight/obese, diabetes, metabolic disorders, and cardiovascular disease. 49 Of note, obesity has been shown to be associated with decreases in cognitive ability 50 and medication adherence may be negatively affected in patients who experience metabolic disruptions or weight gain. 51

### Cariprazine (Vraylar) [^112HeWcW]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Administration of cariprazine to pregnant rats during pregnancy and lactation at oral doses of 0.1, 0.3, and 1 mg/kg/day, which are 0.03 to 0.4 times the MRHD of 6 mg/day based on AUC of total cariprazine, caused a decrease in postnatal survival, birth weight, and post-weaning body weight of first generation pups at the dose that is 0.4 times the MRHD of 6 mg/day based on AUC of total cariprazine in absence of maternal toxicity. First generation pups also had pale, cold bodies and developmental delays (renal papillae not developed or underdeveloped and decreased auditory startle response in males). Reproductive performance of the first generation pups was unaffected; however, the second generation pups had clinical signs and lower body weight similar to those of the first generation pups.

Administration of cariprazine to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis at oral doses of 0.1, 1, and 5 mg/kg/day, which are 0.02 to 4.6 times the MRHD of 6 mg/day based on AUC of total cariprazine, was not teratogenic. Maternal body weight and food consumption were decreased at 4.6 times the MRHD of 6 mg/day based on AUC of total cariprazine; however, no adverse effects were observed on pregnancy parameters or reproductive organs.

8.2 Lactation

Risk Summary

Lactation studies have not been conducted to assess the presence of cariprazine in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Cariprazine is present in rat milk. The development and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for VRAYLAR and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from VRAYLAR or from the underlying maternal condition.

8.4 Pediatric Use

Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Pediatric studies of VRAYLAR have not been conducted. Antidepressants increased the risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors in pediatric patients [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

### Screening and diagnosis of mental health conditions during pregnancy and postpartum: ACOG clinical practice guideline no. 4 [^1171Y5hF]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To review evidence on the current understanding of mental health conditions in pregnancy and postpartum, with a focus on mood and anxiety disorders, and to outline guidelines for screening and diagnosis that are consistent with best available scientific evidence. The conditions or symptoms reviewed include depression, anxiety and anxiety-related disorders, bipolar disorder, suicidality, and postpartum psychosis. For information on psychopharmacologic treatment and management, refer to American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) Clinical Practice Guideline Number 5, "Treatment and Management of Mental Health Conditions During Pregnancy and Postpartum" (1).

Target Population

Pregnant or postpartum individuals with mental health conditions. Onset of these conditions may have predated the perinatal period or may have occurred for the first time in pregnancy or the first year postpartum or may have been exacerbated in that time.

Methods

This guideline was developed using an a priori protocol in conjunction with a writing team consisting of one specialist in obstetrics and gynecology and one maternal-fetal medicine subspecialist appointed by the ACOG Committee on Clinical Practice Guidelines-Obstetrics and two external subject matter experts. ACOG medical librarians completed a comprehensive literature search for primary literature within Cochrane Library, Cochrane Collaboration Registry of Controlled Trials, EMBASE, PubMed, and MEDLINE. Studies that moved forward to the full-text screening stage were assessed by two authors from the writing team based on standardized inclusion and exclusion criteria. Included studies underwent quality assessment, and a modified GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) evidence-to-decision framework was applied to interpret and translate the evidence into recommendation statements.

Recommendations

This Clinical Practice Guideline includes recommendations on the screening and diagnosis of perinatal mental health conditions including depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, acute postpartum psychosis, and the symptom of suicidality. Recommendations are classified by strength and evidence quality. Ungraded Good Practice Points are included to provide guidance when a formal recommendation could not be made because of inadequate or nonexistent evidence.

### Cariprazine for treating coprophagia and organic psychosis in a young woman with acquired brain injury [^1161tY6G]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). High credibility.

Coprophagia or the ingestion of faeces has been associated with medical conditions (seizure disorders, cerebral atrophy and tumours) and psychiatric disorders (mental retardation, alcoholism, depression, obsessive compulsive disorder, schizophrenia, fetishes, delirium and dementia). The case of a woman in her 30s presenting with coprophagia and psychotic symptoms following hypoxic brain injury is reported. The case is discussed and literature is reviewed. We investigate cariprazine, a relatively new atypical antipsychotic for treating coprophagia, associated with psychotic symptoms. Psychiatric evaluation revealed cognitive dysfunction and psychotic symptoms. Physical examination and laboratory evaluation were unremarkable. She was treated with haloperidol resulting in resolution of coprophagia. Attempts at switching to alternative antipsychotics, due to side effects, resulted in recurrence of coprophagia. Subsequent relapses required higher doses of haloperidol for remission of coprophagia and psychotic symptoms. She finally responded to cariprazine. While firm conclusions are not possible from the experience of a single case, we suggest cariprazine may also be a treatment option for coprophagia, particularly in patients with psychotic symptoms.
