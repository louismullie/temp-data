## Question

what blood work would you do with elevated eosinophil levels

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which blood tests to order for elevated blood eosinophils and how to structure the initial workup, including confirming the eosinophilia, staging severity, deciding when to add targeted serologies and molecular tests, and screening for potential end-organ involvement. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming and characterizing the eosinophilia with proper thresholds. Then, I should review baseline laboratory evaluation for all patients. Next, I will consider targeted serologies for secondary causes, followed by indications for clonal testing and bone marrow evaluation. After that, I must assess for end-organ involvement based on severity and duration. Finally, I will outline disease-specific monitoring scenarios and long-term surveillance, making sure to verify each step against guidelines and correct myself if any assumption is off.

> Let me first confirm the eosinophilia properly. I need a CBC with differential to calculate the absolute eosinophil count (AEC) and a peripheral smear to review morphology; if the elevation is mild to moderate, I should repeat the CBC to confirm persistence because transient changes can mislead us if we jump too quickly to a diagnosis [^112y7KKY]. Wait, let me verify the thresholds I am using: mild eosinophilia is 0.5–1.5 × 10^9/L, hypereosinophilia is defined as AEC ≥ 1.5 × 10^9/L, and some literature flags higher risk when AEC exceeds 3,000/µL, or persists above 1,500/µL for more than six months, which I should keep in mind when prioritizing the urgency of workup and referral [^113CYWfc] [^113Poyvg] [^111pRCBw] [^116uXnnE].

> Next, I should review baseline labs for all patients with eosinophilia to establish organ function and systemic inflammatory context. I need renal and liver function tests, a bone profile (calcium, phosphate, alkaline phosphatase), LDH, ESR and/or CRP, and a vitamin B12 level to screen for occult tissue involvement or a myeloid process; these are first-line per BSH and help me not miss early organ injury while I am still working through the differential [^112y7KKY]. Hold on, let me not underestimate "mild" eosinophilia; even counts below the hypereosinophilia threshold can be associated with organ dysfunction, so I should not dismiss symptoms simply because the AEC is under 1.5 × 10^9/L [^113CYWfc].

> I will now examine parasitic etiologies where epidemiology or exposures raise suspicion. I was initially going to rely on stool ova and parasite exams, but wait, I need to correct that impulse because their sensitivity is limited in chronic infections; serologic testing is often necessary, and I should specifically consider Strongyloides serology, especially before any immunosuppression given the risk of hyperinfection, and broaden to other helminths as guided by history and travel [^116uXnnE]. I need to ensure I also preemptively address Strongyloides risk with ivermectin prophylaxis in those who will receive corticosteroids or other immunosuppression to prevent catastrophic hyperinfection [^11624wHo].

> Let me consider allergic and atopic contributions. Total serum IgE is reasonable; values in the range of ≥ 1000 IU/L often point toward fungal allergy or parasitic disease, which can help prioritize next diagnostic steps, though it is not diagnostic by itself and needs to be interpreted with clinical context [^117P6hke]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions regarding eosinophilic esophagitis: blood allergy tests are insufficient to drive an elimination diet, and definitive diagnosis requires targeted esophageal biopsies rather than relying on serologies or blood counts alone, so I must keep the endoscopic pathway in mind if EoE is suspected [^113QwBBN] [^113P2hkZ].

> If a hematologic neoplasm or mast cell disease is on the table, I should confirm whether to add serum tryptase and scrutinize for other myeloid features, given its value in the differential for chronic eosinophilic leukemia and systemic mastocytosis; this fits best when the clinical picture suggests a clonal process or an atypical pattern of eosinophilia [^115BHUKw]. Wait a minute, I should also keep basic principles in mind: combined clinical context from the history and exam remains crucial here to avoid over-testing, but when the pre-test probability is meaningful, tryptase can be pivotal [^112y7KKY] [^112ncxLi].

> Now, for clonal eosinophilia, I need to ensure molecular testing is deployed at the right threshold. For persistent AEC ≥ 1.5 × 10^9/L without an obvious secondary cause, I should order peripheral blood FIP1L1-PDGFRA testing by FISH or nested RT-PCR because a positive result identifies a myeloid neoplasm that responds to imatinib; if that is negative and suspicion persists, I should proceed to bone marrow aspirate and biopsy with cytogenetics [^113Poyvg] [^1124VBh7]. I should also consider flow cytometry and T-cell receptor gene rearrangement testing if the lymphocytic variant of hypereosinophilic syndrome is suspected, acknowledging that abnormal clonal T-cell populations occur in a meaningful minority of hypereosinophilic patients and may guide diagnosis and management [^1124VBh7] [^111pRCBw].

> But wait, what if the counts are high and the duration is long; I need to check for organ involvement proactively. For patients with sustained elevations, particularly AEC > 1,500/µL for more than six months or > 3,000/µL, I should screen for occult cardiac, pulmonary, and other organ injury with blood tests such as troponin T and follow through with imaging and functional assessments including echocardiography, chest imaging, and pulmonary function tests; I should not delay this because early organ injury can be silent and high-risk [^116uXnnE] [^112oHayH]. I should confirm that these tests are coupled to symptom-guided organ-specific labs, such as hepatic and pancreatic enzymes when indicated, to avoid missing evolving damage [^112oHayH].

> Next, I should review disease-specific monitoring scenarios. If eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis is in the differential or established, I need to monitor ANCA thoughtfully because persistent positivity or rising titers can forecast relapse and influence treatment decisions, and if using rituximab, I should verify serum immunoglobulins before each course to detect secondary hypogammaglobulinemia that could alter risk and management [^112rjsas] [^11298gpi]. Hold on, I should verify that ANCA dynamics are interpreted in clinical context because serology alone should not drive all decisions, yet it remains a useful piece of the puzzle in EGPA [^112rjsas].

> If the patient is on eosinophil-lowering biologics, I need to ensure pharmacodynamic monitoring is aligned with expected effects. For mepolizumab, serial blood eosinophil counts should demonstrate a dose-dependent reduction from baseline on the order of roughly two-thirds to near-complete suppression depending on dose and time, so blunted reduction should prompt me to re-check adherence, dosing interval, or competing drivers of eosinophilia [^111JJnQ7]. I should double-check that clinical outcomes correlate with these changes because biomarker reduction without symptom improvement should lead me to reconsider the diagnosis or comorbid contributors [^111JJnQ7].

> I will now examine drug-induced eosinophilia, particularly clozapine. If eosinophilia emerges on clozapine, I must promptly evaluate for systemic signs of DRESS such as rash, myocarditis, hepatitis, colitis, pancreatitis, or nephritis, and if clozapine-related systemic disease is suspected, I should stop the drug immediately; in the absence of organ involvement, careful monitoring with continuation may be reasonable, but I need to reassess if counts keep rising [^1152edsu] [^115rLRda]. Let me reconsider any alternative causes, because if a cause unrelated to clozapine is identified and treated, clozapine may be continued with monitoring, which is an important nuance to avoid unnecessary cessation [^1152edsu] [^115rLRda].

> For patients with persistent hypereosinophilia but no attributable cause or organ damage, I need to ensure long-term surveillance is in place because some will evolve to organ involvement or reveal an underlying diagnosis over time. Annual evaluation with clinical assessment, CBC, and organ function testing is prudent for hypereosinophilia of unknown significance, with a low threshold to re-open the diagnostic workup if counts rise or new symptoms emerge; even so, I must remember that mild eosinophilia can occasionally cause or herald organ dysfunction and warrants vigilance [^117B91gR] [^113CYWfc]. I should double-check for changes in the clonal testing landscape if new features appear, as repeating molecular studies can be helpful when the clinical picture shifts [^113Poyvg].

> Summarizing my approach, I confirm and quantify eosinophilia with CBC/differential and smear, stage severity with attention to thresholds and chronicity, obtain baseline organ and inflammatory labs in all patients, and then add targeted serologies based on exposure risk and phenotype, including parasite testing with an emphasis on serology over stool O&P and pre-immunosuppression Strongyloides precautions; for persistent hypereosinophilia without a secondary cause, I move to FIP1L1-PDGFRA testing and, if negative with ongoing suspicion, bone marrow studies and T-cell workup, while in parallel screening for organ damage with troponin and appropriate imaging and physiologic tests, and I tailor monitoring to disease-specific contexts such as EGPA, biologic therapy, and drug-induced eosinophilia, with long-term surveillance for HEUS to catch evolving disease early [^112y7KKY] [^113Poyvg] [^1124VBh7] [^116uXnnE] [^112oHayH] [^11624wHo] [^112rjsas] [^11298gpi] [^111JJnQ7] [^117B91gR] [^113CYWfc].

For elevated eosinophil levels, start with a **CBC with differential** [^112y7KKY] and peripheral smear to confirm eosinophilia and assess other lineages. Then order **LFTs, renal function, LDH, ESR/CRP, and vitamin B12** [^112y7KKY] to screen for organ involvement and myeloid neoplasms. Add **ANCA, ANA, and IgE** [^112rjsas] to evaluate for vasculitis, autoimmune disease [^112ncxLi], and atopy [^116KAnSA]; check stool O&P [^116uXnnE] and Strongyloides serology [^11624wHo] if exposure risk exists. If AEC ≥ 1.5×10⁹/L or suspicion for clonal disease, obtain FIP1L1-PDGFRA by FISH/RT-PCR [^113Poyvg], JAK2 V617F, and BCR-ABL; consider bone marrow biopsy [^1124VBh7] with flow cytometry and TCR gene rearrangement [^111pRCBw] if no cause is found. Tailor further tests to clinical context and monitor for end-organ damage with troponin [^112oHayH], echocardiography, and imaging as indicated [^116uetMB].

## Initial confirmatory and screening tests

- **Complete blood count (CBC) with differential**: Confirm eosinophilia and assess other hematologic abnormalities (e.g. anemia, leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia) [^112y7KKY].

- **Peripheral blood smear**: Evaluate eosinophil morphology and identify abnormal cells suggestive of hematologic malignancies.

- **Basic metabolic panel (BMP)**: Assess renal function and electrolyte abnormalities [^112y7KKY].

- **Liver function tests (LFTs)**: Evaluate hepatic involvement or dysfunction.

- **Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)**: Elevated in hematologic malignancies and tissue damage [^112y7KKY].

- **Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and/or C-reactive protein (CRP)**: Assess systemic inflammation [^112y7KKY].

- **Vitamin B12 levels**: Elevated in myeloproliferative disorders [^112y7KKY].

---

## Evaluation for allergic, autoimmune, and infectious causes

- **Total serum IgE**: Elevated in allergic conditions and parasitic infections [^116KAnSA].

- **Antinuclear antibody (ANA)**: Screen for autoimmune diseases (e.g. systemic lupus erythematosus) [^112ncxLi].

- **Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA)**: Evaluate for vasculitis (e.g. eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis) [^112rjsas].

- **Stool examination for ova and parasites**: Identify parasitic infections (e.g. Strongyloides, Schistosoma) [^116uXnnE].

- **Strongyloides serology**: Essential in patients with travel history or immunosuppression risk.

---

## Evaluation for hematologic malignancies and clonal eosinophilia

- **FIP1L1-PDGFRA fusion gene testing (FISH or RT-PCR)**: Mandatory in unexplained eosinophilia ≥ 1.5×10⁹/L [^113Poyvg].

- **JAK2 V617F mutation analysis**: Screen for myeloproliferative neoplasms.

- **BCR-ABL fusion gene testing**: Evaluate for chronic myeloid leukemia.

- **Bone marrow aspirate and biopsy**: Indicated if no cause is identified and peripheral FIP1L1-PDGFRA is negative; assess for lymphoma, chronic eosinophilic leukemia, or lymphocytic variant hypereosinophilic syndrome [^1124VBh7].

- **Flow cytometry and T-cell receptor gene rearrangement**: Identify clonal T-cell populations associated with hypereosinophilic syndromes [^1124VBh7] [^111pRCBw].

---

## Assessment of end-organ involvement

Assess end-organ involvement with **cardiac biomarkers** (troponin T/I, BNP) to evaluate eosinophilic myocarditis or other cardiac involvement, and use **echocardiography** to assess cardiac function and structural abnormalities [^112oHayH]. Evaluate respiratory involvement with **pulmonary function tests** [^112oHayH] [^116uetMB], and obtain a chest X-ray or CT to identify pulmonary infiltrates or involvement of other organs [^112oHayH].

### Eosinophilia in a patient from South America [^116uXnnE]. JAMA (2008). Low credibility.

Asymptomatic eosinophilia is a common finding in returning travelers and immigrants from parasite-endemic areas. We present a 49-year-old man from Guyana who immigrated to the United States 4 years prior to examination. He had persistent asymptomatic eosinophilia, and multiple stool examinations were negative for ova and parasites. Although the list of parasitic diseases associated with eosinophilia is extensive, the differential diagnosis of asymptomatic eosinophilia with negative stool evaluations is rather limited.

We discuss elements of the clinical history and examination essential for evaluating eosinophilia in patients at risk of parasitic diseases and present a simple algorithm to guide diagnostic testing. Despite the importance of repeated stool examinations for the presence of ova and parasites, in practice, this test is not sensitive. Serologic testing for chronic parasitic infections is often necessary. Most cases without a definitive diagnosis can be conservatively managed with serial monitoring or empirically treated with antihelminthic therapy. However, patients with an absolute eosinophil count of more than 3000/microL or more than 1500/microL for more than 6 months are at risk of end-organ damage and should be referred for specialized parasitic and/or hematology consultation.

### Nucala [^111JJnQ7]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

The pharmacodynamic response, specifically blood eosinophil reduction, following repeated doses of mepolizumab administered subcutaneously or intravenously, was evaluated in adult subjects with asthma and blood eosinophil levels greater than 200 cells/mcL. Subjects received one of four mepolizumab treatments administered every 28 days for a total of three doses: 12.5 mg subcutaneous, 125 mg subcutaneous, 250 mg subcutaneous, or 75 mg IV. Sixty-six of the seventy randomized subjects completed the trial. Compared with baseline levels, blood eosinophils decreased in a dose-dependent manner.

A reduction in blood eosinophil levels was observed in all treatment groups by Day 3 (48 hours post-dose). On Day 84 (4 weeks post-last dose), the observed geometric mean reduction from baseline in blood eosinophils was 64%, 78%, 84%, and 90% in the 12.5-mg subcutaneous, 75-mg IV, 125-mg subcutaneous, and 250-mg subcutaneous treatment groups, respectively. The model-predicted subcutaneous doses providing 50% and 90% of maximal reduction of blood eosinophils at Day 84 were estimated to be 11 and 99 mg, respectively.

These results, along with the clinical efficacy data from the dose-ranging exacerbation trial in adult and adolescent subjects with severe asthma (Trial 1), supported the evaluation of mepolizumab 75 mg IV and 100 mg subcutaneous in the confirmatory severe asthma trials [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. Following subcutaneous administration of mepolizumab 100 mg every 4 weeks for 32 weeks in adult and adolescent subjects with severe asthma (Trial 2), blood eosinophils were reduced to a geometric mean.

### Neupogen [^112UFHhQ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2009). Low credibility.

A CBC and platelet count should be obtained prior to chemotherapy and at regular intervals (twice per week) during Neupogen® therapy. Following cytotoxic chemotherapy, the neutrophil nadir occurred earlier during cycles when Neupogen® was administered, and WBC differentials demonstrated a left shift, including the appearance of promyelocytes and myeloblasts. In addition, the duration of severe neutropenia was reduced and was followed by an accelerated recovery in the neutrophil counts.

Frequent CBCs and platelet counts are recommended (at least 3 times per week) following marrow transplantation.

During the initial 4 weeks of Neupogen® therapy and during the 2 weeks following any dose adjustment, a CBC with differential and platelet count should be performed twice weekly. Once a patient is clinically stable, a CBC with differential and platelet count should be performed monthly during the first year of treatment. Thereafter, if clinically stable, routine monitoring with regular CBCs (i.e. as clinically indicated but at least quarterly) is recommended. Additionally, for those patients with congenital neutropenia, annual bone marrow and cytogenetic evaluations should be performed throughout the duration of treatment (see WARNINGS, ADVERSE REACTIONS).

- **Observations in clinical trials**: Cyclic fluctuations in the neutrophil counts were frequently observed in patients with congenital or idiopathic neutropenia after initiation of Neupogen® therapy. Platelet counts were generally at the upper limits of normal prior to Neupogen® therapy.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for insomnia, more specifically with respect to additional testing, the EIN/ESRS 2023 guidelines recommend obtaining the following additional tests if clinically indicated:

- **Laboratory tests**: Including CBC, hemoglobin, ferritin, vitamin B12, thyroid, hepatic and renal tests, and CRP.
- **Circadian markers**: Including melatonin and core body temperature.
- **ECG, EEG**.
- **CT/MRI**.

### Predicting airway hyperresponsiveness to methacholine in patients with atopic dermatitis [^115Cw4qn]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2025). High credibility.

We conclude that some patients with atopic dermatitis (AD) without a history of asthma, particularly those with moderate-to-severe disease, high blood eosinophil levels, elevated IgE levels, or eosinophilic airway inflammation, could present with airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR). Careful clinical monitoring should be considered for these patients, as they may require treatment for asthma in the future.

- **Clinical implications**: AHR in patients with AD without asthma is associated with the severity of AD and blood eosinophil levels. These patients should be monitored for AHR.

### Eosinophilic gastroenteritis associated with multiple gastric cancer [^116kYVHq]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2012). Low credibility.

Eosinophilic gastroenteritis (EG) is an inflammation of the digestive tract characterized by eosinophilic infiltration. The symptoms vary depending on the layer affected by the infiltration. A 69-year-old Japanese man presented to our hospital with a history of general malaise, diarrhea, and dysgeusia. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy showed reddish elevated lesions that were edematous across the gastric mucosa. Additionally, three tumors were observed. Biopsies of the reddish elevated mucosa revealed eosinophilic infiltration, while those from the tumors showed tubular adenocarcinoma.

Colonoscopy revealed abnormal reddish elevated mucosa, which also presented eosinophilic infiltration upon biopsy. A computed tomography scan showed a tumor stain on the anterior wall of the gastric body, but no ascites, intestinal wall thickening, or lymph node swelling was found. Laboratory tests indicated a slight elevation in serum immunoglobulin E (IgE) at 480 IU/ml; other results were within normal limits, including peripheral eosinophil counts. No specific allergens were detected from the multiple antigen simultaneous test and skin patch test. Parasitic immunodiagnosis was negative. The patient was diagnosed with EG associated with gastric cancer and underwent total gastrectomy with regional lymph node dissection and reconstruction via a Roux-en-Y method. He was prescribed prednisolone post-operation and showed a good clinical response. There are many case reports on EG, but

### Blood eosinophils and inhaled corticosteroid/long-acting β-2 agonist efficacy in COPD [^115tqDH3]. Thorax (2016). Low credibility.

We examined blood eosinophil levels as a potential biomarker for reduction in exacerbation frequency with ICS/LABA versus LAMA or placebo using data from six randomized, controlled trials of FP/SAL in patients with COPD, including three that followed patients for at least 1 year. The 2% threshold for high versus low blood eosinophil level (at baseline) was chosen for consistency with previous studies. The results of all studies were consistent with the hypothesis that there is a greater reduction in exacerbation rate with ICS/LABA, compared with placebo or LAMA, in individuals with a pretreatment blood eosinophil level ≥ 2%.

The proportion of patients with a pretreatment eosinophil level ≥ 2% was 50–75% across all six studies. All studies recruited patients with well-defined COPD with a smoking history averaging approximately 40 pack-years, so the inadvertent inclusion of patients with asthma is unlikely to account for any variation in baseline eosinophil levels. In TRISTAN, which had the highest proportion of patients with elevated eosinophils, the majority of patients (88%) were not atopic in either subgroup. Most clinical characteristics, such as age, sex, smoking history, and baseline lung function, showed no discernible differences between those with a pretreatment eosinophil level of < 2% vs ≥ 2%; however, there was a slightly higher proportion of smokers in the < 2% vs ≥ 2% subgroup across all six studies.

### Familial aggregation and heritability of asthma-associated quantitative traits in a population-based sample of nuclear families [^112Qhrqd]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2000). Low credibility.

Asthma is a common, genetically complex human disease. Elevated serum immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels, elevated blood eosinophil counts, variably reduced spirometric measures, and increased airway responsiveness (AR) are physiological traits characteristic of asthma. We investigated the genetic and environmental components of variance of serum total and specific IgE levels, blood eosinophil counts, the forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), and forced vital capacity (FVC), and AR in an Australian population-based sample of 232 Caucasian nuclear families. With the exception of FVC levels, all traits were closely associated with clinical asthma in this population.

- **Serum total and specific IgE levels**: Loge total serum IgE levels had a narrow-sense heritability (h2N) of 47.3% (SE = 10.0%). Specific serum IgE levels against house dust mite and Timothy grass, measured as a RAST Index, had an h2N of 33.8% (SE = 7.3%).

- **Spirometric measures**: FEV1 levels had a h2N of 6.1% (SE = 11.6%), while FVC levels had a h2N of 30.6% (SE = 26.8%).

- **Airway responsiveness (AR)**: Quantified by the loge dose-response slope to methacholine (DRS), AR had a h2N of 30.3% (SE = 12.3%).

These data are consistent with the existence of important genetic determinants of the pathophysiological traits associated with asthma. Our study suggests that total and specific serum IgE levels, blood eosinophil counts, and airway responsiveness to inhaled agonists are appropriate phenotypes for molecular investigations of the genetic susceptibility to asthma.

### Burden of asthma with elevated blood eosinophil levels [^114rtyhL]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Asthma is a common chronic condition with an economic burden of almost $56 billion annually in the US. Biologic markers, like blood eosinophils that help predict the risk of exacerbation, could help guide more optimal treatment plans and reduce costs. The purpose of this study was to determine whether healthcare resource use and expenditures vary by eosinophil level among patients with asthma.

- **Methods**: Patients with asthma, defined by ICD-9-CM code 493.xx, were extracted from the EMRClaims+database (eMAX Health, White Plains, NY) between January 2004 and July 2011. These patients were classified as mild, moderate, or severe based on medication use following diagnosis, in line with the recommendations of the National Institutes of Health Expert Panel Report 3. They were further categorized into elevated eosinophils (≥ 400 cells/μL) and normal eosinophil levels (< 400 cells/μL). Resource use was defined as hospitalizations, ER visits, and outpatient visits, and associated costs were calculated to assess economic differences between eosinophil groups. Non-parametric tests were used to compare resource use and associated costs between elevated and normal eosinophil groups. Multivariate modeling was performed to assess the contribution of eosinophil level on the likelihood of study outcomes among patients with severe asthma.

- **Results**: Among the 2,164 patients meeting eligibility criteria, 1,144 had severity designations. Of these, 179 (16%) patients had severe asthma, of which 20% (n = 35) had elevated eosinophils. Seventeen percent of patients were found to have…

### ACG clinical guideline: Diagnosis and management of eosinophilic esophagitis [^113P2hkZ]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic procedures for eosinophilic esophagitis, and more specifically with respect to esophageal biopsy, the ACG 2025 guidelines recommend obtaining at least six esophageal biopsies from at least two esophageal levels (such as proximal/mid and distal). These should target EoE endoscopic findings, if possible, to assess for histologic features consistent with EoE.

### Burden of asthma with elevated blood eosinophil levels [^111RAqm5]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Methods

- **Study design and data source**: We conducted a retrospective cohort analysis of US asthma patients between January 2004 and July 2011. Patients with a primary or secondary diagnosis of asthma were followed to assess their resource use and cost. Data was extracted from EMRClaims+, an integrated health services database of patients located in the Midwest region of the United States. The database includes administrative insurance claims from a managed care plan of approximately 675,000 lives linked to an overlapping healthcare provider database of electronic medical records data (EMR), including laboratory values and provider billing files. The database also tracks commercially insured lives through provider-aligned patient panels, managed care membership files, and a Master Patient Index.

- **Study population**: All patients with at least two encounters in the inpatient, emergency room (ER), or outpatient (OP) setting with an International Classification of Diseases-9-Clinical Modification [ICD-9-CM] code 493.xx as the primary or secondary diagnosis were selected. The date of the first asthma diagnosis during the study period was defined as the index diagnosis date. Patients less than 12 years of age at the time of index diagnosis were excluded. Patients were required to be continuously enrolled for a period of at least 13 months after the index date, consisting of a 12-month 'assessment period' to establish severity classifications based on medication use and to record eosinophil test results, and a follow-up of 1 to 12 months after this assessment period.

### Relationship of inhaled corticosteroid adherence to asthma exacerbations in patients with moderate-to-severe asthma [^116yGtaZ]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2018). Low credibility.

Patients with asthma and elevated blood eosinophils are at increased risk of severe exacerbations. Management of these patients should consider nonadherence to inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) therapy as a factor for increased exacerbation risk.

- **Objective**: The objective of this study was to investigate whether poor adherence to ICS therapy explains the occurrence of asthma exacerbations in patients with elevated blood eosinophil levels.

- **Methods**: This historical cohort study identified patients within the Optimum Patient Care Research Database, aged 18 years or more, at Global Initiative for Asthma step 3 or 4, with two or more ICS prescriptions during the year before the clinical review. Patient characteristics and adherence (based on prescription refills and patient self-report) for ICS therapy were analyzed for those with elevated (> 400 cells/μL) or normal (≤ 400 cells/μL) blood eosinophils.

- **Results**: We studied 7195 patients (66% female, mean age 60 years) with a median eosinophil count of 200 cells/μL and found 81% to be not fully adherent to ICS therapy. A total of 1031 patients (14%) had elevated blood eosinophil counts (58% female, mean age 60 years), 83% of whom were not fully adherent to ICS. An increased proportion of adherent patients in the elevated blood eosinophil group had two or more exacerbations (14.0% vs. 7.2%; p = 0.003) and uncontrolled asthma (73% vs. 60.8%; p = 0.004) as compared with non-fully adherent patients.

- **Conclusions**: Approximately 1 in 7 patients had elevated eosinophils. Adherence to ICS therapy was not associated with decreased exacerbation.

### Utility of eosinophil peroxidase as a biomarker of eosinophilic inflammation in asthma [^115DdPj1]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2024). Low credibility.

The relative utility of eosinophil peroxidase (EPX) and blood and sputum eosinophil counts as disease biomarkers in asthma is uncertain. We sought to determine the utility of EPX as a biomarker of systemic and airway eosinophilic inflammation in asthma.

- **Methods**: EPX protein was measured by immunoassay in serum and sputum in 110 healthy controls to establish a normal reference range and in repeated samples of serum and sputum collected during three years of observation in 480 participants in the Severe Asthma Research Program 3.

- **Results**: Over three years, EPX levels in patients with asthma were higher than normal in 27% to 31% of serum samples and 36% to 53% of sputum samples. Eosinophils and EPX correlated better in blood than in sputum (r_s values of 0.74 and 0.43, respectively), and high sputum EPX levels occurred in 27% of participants with blood eosinophil counts less than 150 cells/μL and 42% of participants with blood eosinophil counts between 150 and 299 cells/μL. Patients with persistently high sputum EPX values for three years were characterized by severe airflow obstruction, frequent exacerbations, and high mucus plug scores. In 59 patients with asthma who started mepolizumab during observation, serum EPX levels normalized in 96%, but sputum EPX normalized in only 49%. Lung function remained abnormal even when sputum EPX normalized.

- **Conclusions**: Serum EPX is a valid protein biomarker of systemic eosinophilic inflammation in asthma, and sputum EPX levels are a more sensitive biomarker of airway eosinophilic inflammation than sputum eosinophil counts.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for acute ischemic stroke, more specifically with respect to laboratory tests, AHA/ASA 2021 guidelines recommend considering obtaining tests for the following causes as clinically indicated to identify contributors to or relevant risk factors for stroke in patients with cryptogenic stroke:

- **Markers of systemic inflammation**: Tests should be conducted to determine the presence of systemic inflammation contributing to stroke risk.

- **Inherited or acquired hypercoagulable state**: Identifying hypercoagulable conditions may help ascertain contributing factors to stroke occurrences.

- **Inherited diseases associated with stroke**: Screening for inherited diseases linked with stroke is crucial to understanding underlying risk factors.

- **Bloodstream or cerebral spinal fluid infections**: These infections can play a significant role in stroke causation and should be thoroughly investigated.

- **Infections causing CNS vasculitis (such as HIV and syphilis)**: Investigative tests for infections leading to CNS vasculitis may provide additional insight into stroke risk.

- **Drug use (such as cocaine and amphetamines)**: Evaluating drug use is essential, as substances like cocaine and amphetamines can contribute to stroke incidence.

### Asthmatic adult with marked blood eosinophilia: Is it truly asthma [^1113krS4]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

To our knowledge, there are no specific agreed diagnostic criteria for idiopathic chronic eosinophilic pneumonia (CEP). Diagnosis is usually based on the association of respiratory symptoms lasting more than two weeks; alveolar and/or blood eosinophilia (bronchoalveolar lavage differential eosinophil count > 25%, but typically ≥ 40%, blood eosinophilia ≥ 1000/μL); pulmonary infiltrates in a predominantly peripheral pattern on chest imaging, as well as exclusion of any known causes of eosinophilia. CEP typically affects patients in their 30s to 40s, and a history of atopy is found in up to 60% of these cases. The onset of disease is typically insidious, and the mean time to diagnosis from presentation can take up to five months. Common presenting symptoms include cough, dyspnoea, fever, night sweats, and weight loss. Asthma may be present in up to 50% of patients and may occur before, during, or after the diagnosis of CEP.

No laboratory studies are specific for CEP. Peripheral blood eosinophils are typically > 1000/μL, accompanied by a high erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein. Serum IgE is elevated in nearly 50% of cases, with a mean of 1214 ng/mL. Spirometry in CEP may be obstructive, restrictive, or normal. A case series of 19 patients revealed an obstructive pattern in 21%, a restrictive pattern in 47%, and a normal pattern in 32%. Diffusion studies usually reveal a reduced carbon monoxide transfer factor and carbon monoxide transfer coefficient. Radiological findings typically show bilateral peripheral, non-segmental, consolidative opacities described as the 'photographic negative' of pulmonary edema.

### Approach to eosinophilia presenting with pulmonary symptoms [^116uetMB]. Chest (2021). Low credibility.

Eosinophilia with pulmonary involvement is characterized by the presence of peripheral blood eosinophilia, typically ≥ 500 cells/mm³, pulmonary symptoms, and nonspecific findings from physical examinations. It is supported by radiographic evidence of pulmonary disease and histopathologic evidence of tissue eosinophilia in a lung or pleura biopsy specimen and/or increased eosinophils in BAL fluid, usually > 10%.

Considering the variety of underlying causes of eosinophilia with pulmonary manifestations and the overlapping clinical, laboratory, and radiologic features, it is essential to approach the evaluation systematically. This review describes a case presentation and discusses:

- **Differential diagnosis**: A directed approach to the diagnostic evaluation.
- **Supporting literature**: Treatment strategies for pulmonary eosinophilia syndromes and the levels of evidence underlying the recommendations, where available.

Overall, optimal management of eosinophilic lung disease presentations is directed at the underlying cause when identifiable. The urgency of treatment may be guided by the presence of severe end-organ involvement or life-threatening complications. When an underlying cause is not easily attributable, management largely relies on eosinophil-directed interventions, for which biologic therapies are increasingly being used.

### Asthmatic adult with marked blood eosinophilia: is it truly asthma [^114M6ZZe]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

A middle-aged woman presented with symptoms suggestive of allergic asthma but with markedly elevated peripheral eosinophilia. She did not respond to inhaled corticosteroids, prompting further investigations. Her chest radiograph was normal. A CT of the chest revealed bi-apical ground glass opacities. Bronchoalveolar lavage revealed a predominantly eosinophilic yield. An autoimmune screen was negative. Bone marrow biopsy showed a normocellular marrow with increased eosinophils.

A diagnosis of chronic eosinophilic pneumonia (CEP) was made after excluding other causes of eosinophilia. Treatment of her CEP with systemic corticosteroids (prednisolone 0.5 mg/kg/day) resulted in dramatic improvement in symptoms and peripheral eosinophilia.

### Biomarkers for severe eosinophilic asthma [^117GVqHH]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2017). Low credibility.

The last decade has seen the approval of several new biologics for the treatment of severe asthma, targeting specific endotypes and phenotypes. This review examines how evidence from the mepolizumab clinical development program showed that blood eosinophil counts, rather than sputum or tissue eosinophil counts, evolved as a pharmacodynamic and predictive biomarker for the efficacy of treatment with mepolizumab in patients with severe eosinophilic asthma. Based on the available evidence and combined with clinical judgment, a baseline blood eosinophil threshold of 150 cells/μL or greater, or a historical blood eosinophil threshold of 300 cells/μL or greater, will allow the selection of patients with severe eosinophilic asthma who are most likely to achieve clinically significant reductions in the rate of exacerbations with mepolizumab treatment.

### Value of peripheral blood eosinophil markers to predict severity of asthma [^113bHwR5]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

This study highlights the association between asthma severity, as defined by EPR guidelines, and eosinophil elevation. The probability of eosinophil elevation increases for patients with greater asthma severity. Blood eosinophil level may represent an important characteristic of disease severity, especially as new therapeutic alternatives emerge for this patient phenotype after exhausting less aggressive medication regimens.

Further research correlating blood eosinophil levels with risk-based severity and control measures (such as asthma exacerbations leading to ER visits and/or hospital admissions) is warranted to externally validate the observed association. Evidence of the association between blood eosinophil levels and asthma severity underscores the need for treatment options designed specifically for asthma patients with elevated eosinophil levels.

### Versacloz [^1152edsu]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Eosinophilia**: Eosinophilia, defined as a blood eosinophil count greater than 700/μL, has been observed with clozapine treatment. In clinical trials, approximately 1% of patients developed eosinophilia. Clozapine-related eosinophilia typically occurs during the first month of treatment. In some cases, it has been associated with myocarditis, pancreatitis, hepatitis, colitis, and nephritis. Such organ involvement could align with a drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms syndrome (DRESS), also known as drug-induced hypersensitivity syndrome (DIHS). If eosinophilia emerges during Versacloz treatment, promptly evaluate for signs and symptoms of systemic reactions, such as rash or other allergic symptoms, myocarditis, or other organ-specific diseases associated with eosinophilia. If clozapine-related systemic disease is suspected, discontinue Versacloz immediately.

If a cause of eosinophilia unrelated to clozapine is identified (e.g. asthma, allergies, collagen vascular disease, parasitic infections, and specific neoplasms), address the underlying cause and continue Versacloz.

Clozapine-related eosinophilia has also occurred without organ involvement and can resolve without intervention. There are reports of successful rechallenge after discontinuation of clozapine, without recurrence of eosinophilia. In the absence of organ involvement, continue Versacloz with careful monitoring. If the total eosinophil count continues to rise over several weeks in the absence of systemic disease, the decision to interrupt Versacloz therapy and rechallenge should be considered.

### Eosinophils-from cradle to grave: An EAACI task force paper on new molecular insights and clinical functions of eosinophils and the clinical effects of targeted eosinophil depletion [^114XaPaj]. Allergy (2023). High credibility.

Over the past years, eosinophils have become a focus of scientific interest, especially in the context of their recently uncovered functions (e.g. antiviral, anti-inflammatory, regulatory). These versatile cells display both beneficial and detrimental activities under various physiological and pathological conditions. Eosinophils are involved in the pathogenesis of many diseases, which can be classified into primary (clonal), secondary (reactive) disorders, and idiopathic (hyper)eosinophilic syndromes. Depending on the biological specimen, the eosinophil count in different body compartments may serve as a biomarker reflecting the underlying pathophysiology and/or activity of distinct diseases and acts as a therapy-driving (predictive) and monitoring tool.

Personalized selection of an appropriate therapeutic strategy, directly or indirectly targeting the increased number and/or activity of eosinophils, should be based on the understanding of eosinophil homeostasis, including their interactions with other immune and non-immune cells within different body compartments. Hence, restoring as well as maintaining homeostasis within an individual's eosinophil pool is a goal of both specific and non-specific eosinophil-targeting therapies. Despite the overall favorable safety profile of the currently available anti-eosinophil biologics, the effect of eosinophil depletion should be monitored from the perspective of possible unwanted consequences.

### Value of peripheral blood eosinophil markers to predict severity of asthma [^114ZEP9P]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Asthma represents a significant clinical and economic burden to the US healthcare system. Along with other clinical manifestations of the disease, elevated sputum and blood eosinophil levels are observed in patients experiencing asthma exacerbations. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between blood eosinophil levels and asthma severity defined using Expert Panel Report 3 guidelines.

- **Methods**: Patients with an asthma diagnosis between 2004 and 2011 were extracted from the EMRClaims+ database (eMAX Health, White Plains, NY), which contains electronic medical records linked to insurance claims for over 675,000 patients. The date of the first asthma diagnosis was defined as the 'index date'. Patients were required to have at least 1 peripheral eosinophil test (elevated defined as ≥ 400 cells/μL) in the 12-month 'assessment' period following the index date. We classified patients as those with mild asthma and moderate-to-severe asthma based on the pattern of medication use, as recommended by the 2007 National Institutes of Health Expert Panel Report. Logistic regression models were used to determine if patients with moderate-to-severe asthma had an increased likelihood of an elevated peripheral eosinophil count, after accounting for demographics and comorbidities.

- **Results**: Among 1,144 patients with an asthma diagnosis, 60% were classified as having moderate-to-severe asthma. Twenty-four percent of patients with moderate-to-severe asthma and 19% of patients with mild asthma had an elevated peripheral eosinophil count (p = 0.053). Logistic regression showed that mod

### Dupixent [^111NpxA5]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

The demographics and baseline characteristics for VOYAGE are provided in Table 23 below.

Dupixent significantly reduced the annualized rate of severe asthma exacerbation events during the 52-week treatment period compared to placebo in populations with an eosinophilic phenotype, as indicated by elevated blood eosinophils and/or the population with elevated FeNO. Subgroup analyses for results of Dupixent treatment, based on either baseline eosinophil level or baseline FeNO level, were similar to the pediatric (12 to 17 years of age) and adult trials as described for the adult and pediatric (12 to 17 years of age) asthma population above. In subjects with a baseline blood eosinophil count of fewer than 150 cells/mcL and FeNO less than 20 ppb, similar severe asthma exacerbation rates were observed between Dupixent and placebo.

Significant improvements in percent predicted pre-bronchodilator FEV1 were observed at Week 12. Significant improvements in percent predicted FEV1 were observed as early as Week 2 and were maintained through Week 52 in VOYAGE (Figure 10).

- **Mean change from baseline in percent predicted pre-bronchodilator FEV1**: Improvements over time in pediatric subjects aged 6 to 11 years in VOYAGE, with baseline blood eosinophils ≥ 300 cells/mcL.

Improvements were also observed for ACQ-7-IA and PAQLQ(S)-IA at Week 24 and were sustained at Week 52. Greater responder rates were observed for ACQ-7-IA and PAQLQ(S)-IA compared to placebo at Week 24. The responder rate was defined as an improvement in score of 0.5 or more (scale range 0–6).

The efficacy results for VOYAGE are presented in Table 24.

### Blood eosinophil count as a predictor of lung function decline in healthy individuals [^111ENwnC]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2021). Low credibility.

Little is known about the effect of blood eosinophil count (BEC) on a decline in lung function in healthy individuals. Using a well-established health screening database, we assessed the associations between BEC and a decline in lung function, measured as the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV₁).

- **Methods**: Serial BEC and FEV₁ data were analyzed using linear mixed models adjusted for gender, height, and smoking status. The association between BEC consistency and a decline in FEV₁ was evaluated in subpopulation analyses.

- **Results**: A total of 4634 individuals were enrolled. The mean number of health screenings was 7.49 over an average of 11.74 years of observation. A higher log₂-transformed BEC was significantly associated with a greater decline in FEV₁ that was stronger in nonsmokers (P = 8.56 × 10 <sup> -8 <sup>) than in smokers (P = 1.52 × 10 <sup> -3 <sup>). In subpopulation analyses of 2018 individuals with consistent BECs, those with BECs consistently ≥ 100/μL (P = 4.58 × 10 <sup> -6 <sup>), ≥ 200/μL (P = 3.53 × 10 <sup> -7 <sup>), and ≥ 300/μL (P = 1.12 × 10 <sup> -3 <sup>) had a significantly higher dose-dependent FEV₁ decline than those with BECs consistently < 100/μL. A BEC threshold of 100/μL in nonsmokers and 200/μL in smokers may predict an accelerated decline in FEV₁.

- **Conclusions**: BEC is associated with a decline in FEV₁, and a consistently high BEC is an independent risk factor for an accelerated decline in FEV₁. These results suggest the use of the BEC to identify healthy individuals at high risk for developing chronic lung disease, which in turn may enable tailored prevention strategies.

### Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis: Patient profiles from a large US allergy practice [^116tLvyV]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology Global (2025). Low credibility.

Characteristics and outcomes assessed included patient demographic characteristics at index, physician characteristics, patient comorbidities at any time, laboratory assessments, symptoms and manifestations, treatment characteristics and outcomes, and healthcare resource utilization (HCRU) postindex. Results generated for the postindex period included the index date. Laboratory tests postindex included absolute blood eosinophil count (BEC), Asthma Control Test, FEV1, and the ANCA test. Symptoms and manifestations assessed postindex included the number of distinct patient-reported symptoms by organ class.

Treatment characteristics included the proportion of patients using respiratory medications including OCSs, biologics, and immunosuppressants. OCS use was also assessed by the number of prescriptions per-patient-per-year (PPPY) and the prednisone-equivalent daily dose, categorized as ≤ 6 mg/d, > 6 to ≤ 12 mg/d, and > 12 mg/d, as defined by a previous study. Postindex clinical outcomes included the proportion and number of patients achieving a treatment response, achieving controlled status, and experiencing an EGPA relapse. The time from the index date to the first response or controlled status, and the duration of the first response or controlled status were also assessed.

Two types of response were defined:

- **Response (symptoms only)**: Defined as physician-reported improved/controlled symptoms.
- **Response (hematologic and symptoms)**: Assessed when patients had a BEC assessment within 30 days of a symptom response and classified as complete or partial. A complete response was defined as physician-reported improved/controlled symptoms with accompanying hematologic improvement.

### Value of peripheral blood eosinophil markers to predict severity of asthma [^112JwZ5a]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

In this sample of commercially insured asthma patients aged 12 years or older, we attempted to define asthma severity by adopting recommended medications described as step therapies by EPR 3 guidelines. This study found a clear association between asthma severity and peripheral blood eosinophils, with moderate-to-severe asthma associated with an increased likelihood of eosinophil elevation. The finding is consistent with previous literature showing a correlation of sputum and blood eosinophil levels in asthmatic patients.

Jatakanon and colleagues followed a group of patients with asthma for a period of 8 weeks, and baseline comparisons showed a significantly greater sputum eosinophil count for the group that developed exacerbations versus those that did not. The same study, through step-wise forward regression, reported that increased sputum eosinophil was associated with decreased airway function in terms of decreased forced expiratory volume (FEV). While the literature supports the association of blood eosinophil elevation with severity or functional impairment, identification of a clinically meaningful threshold eosinophil value seems far less clear.

Our observed association between severity and eosinophil levels at ≥ 400 cells/μL did not hold for levels ≥ 300 cells/μL or ≥ 140 cells/μL. While this does not provide evidence for the optimal threshold, it suggests that these lower cut-points may be of limited value in assessing patient risk. The observed association between blood eosinophil levels at ≥ 400 cells/μL and asthma severity underscores the complexity in identifying cut-off values.

### Applications and limitations of blood eosinophilia for the diagnosis of acute cellular rejection in liver transplantation [^116uyEQ9]. American Journal of Transplantation (2003). Low credibility.

This study evaluates the predictive value of the blood eosinophil count in diagnosing acute cellular rejection. It investigates its value as a marker of response to treatment and its diagnostic use in a subgroup of patients with normal transaminases. The study also compares blood eosinophilia in patients with and without hepatitis C virus infection.

A consecutive cohort of 101 liver transplant patients, 275 liver biopsies, and blood eosinophils recorded on the day or one day before biopsy were analyzed. An elevated eosinophil count has a positive predictive value of 82% for acute cellular rejection. A normal eosinophil count excludes moderate/severe rejection with a predictive value of 86%. The eosinophil count decreases in 69% of patients following treatment of acute cellular rejection with corticosteroids, irrespective of treatment outcome.

- **Acute cellular rejection and hepatitis C virus**: Acute cellular rejection in the presence of an elevated eosinophil count occurs significantly less often (p = 0.007) in patients with hepatitis C virus.

An elevated eosinophil count is a valuable marker of acute cellular rejection. However, blood eosinophil levels should not be used to predict acute cellular rejection following treatment with corticosteroids. Blood eosinophilia, seen less often in patients with hepatitis C virus, may reflect an over-diagnosis of acute cellular rejection in these patients.

### Prevalence and spectrum of T-cell lymphoproliferative disorders in patients with hypereosinophilia: A reference laboratory experience [^111pRCBw]. Annals of Diagnostic Pathology (2020). Low credibility.

Hypereosinophilia (HE) is defined as a persistently elevated absolute eosinophil count (AEC) ≥ 1.5 × 10^9/L, which can be due to a variety of underlying causes. In this study, we investigated the prevalence and spectrum of T-cell lymphoproliferative disorders in 124 consecutive patients with HE by flow cytometric immunophenotyping. Available medical records, pathology reports, and T-cell receptor (TCR) gene rearrangement were reviewed. Fifteen patients (12%) with HE had abnormal T-cell populations that were initially detected by flow cytometry. The presence of immunophenotypically abnormal T cells was not associated with higher AEC or higher absolute lymphocyte count levels in comparison to those without abnormal T cells.

Molecular studies concordantly identified a clonal TCR gene rearrangement in 8 of 10 cases tested. Based on the combination of clinical presentation, morphologic findings, and laboratory studies, seven patients were diagnosed with the lymphocytic variant of hypereosinophilic syndrome and five with overt T-cell lymphoma (4 peripheral T-cell lymphoma NOS, 1 primary cutaneous T-cell lymphoma). The remaining three had an unknown diagnosis due to a lack of information and additional workup would be warranted. These findings underscore the importance of flow cytometry as a screening tool to identify T-cell lymphoproliferative disorders in patients with HE.

Results of sensitivity analyses conducted for elevated eosinophil levels defined as ≥ 300 cells/μL showed that elevated blood eosinophils was not associated with moderate-to-severe asthma (OR: 1.07, 95% CI: 0.83–1.38, p = 0.587). Similarly, elevated eosinophils at ≥ 140 cells/μL also showed no significant association with moderate-to-severe asthma (OR: 0.957, 95% CI: 0.747–1.226, p = 0.728).

### Eosinophilic gastrointestinal diseases with overall gastrointestinal tract causing liver abscess in an older patient: A case report and literature review [^112MJNvo]. BMC Geriatrics (2024). Low credibility.

A plain scan and enhanced CT images showed several gastrointestinal issues: the CT plain scan revealed diffuse thickening of the lower esophagus, gastric antrum, duodenum, and jejunum walls. There was local narrowing of the lumen and a large fluid accumulation in the abdomen and pelvis. The enhanced CT scan displayed diffuse, uniform enhancement of the thickened lumen with no obvious abnormal enhancement lesions.

Enhanced CT images from the arterial and venous phases of the liver showed a circular low-density shadow with a diameter of about 20 mm in the right lobe of the liver. This was characterized by unclear boundaries and a few flocculent high-density shadows around the lesion. Enhanced scanning showed circular enhancement at the edge of the lesion in the arterial phase. In the portal and delayed phases, the enhancement filled inward. A few flocculent arterial phase enhancement shadows around the lesion were observed, exiting in the portal and delayed phases, presenting a relatively equal density shadow.

The patient underwent gastrointestinal endoscopy. Gastroscopy revealed edema in the esophagus, gastric antrum, and the descending part of the duodenum near the bulb, while colonoscopy showed scattered erythema throughout the colon. Biopsies were taken from the esophagus, gastric antrum, descending duodenum, ascending colon, transverse colon, and descending colon.

### Burden of asthma with elevated blood eosinophil levels [^116ACnPB]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Asthma is a common chronic condition with an economic burden of almost $56 billion annually in the US. Biologic markers, like blood eosinophils that help predict the risk of exacerbation, could help guide more optimal treatment plans and reduce costs. The purpose of this study was to determine whether healthcare resource use and expenditures vary by eosinophil level among patients with asthma.

- **Methods**: Patients with a diagnosis of asthma, defined by ICD-9-CM code 493.xx between January 2004 and July 2011, were extracted from the EMRClaims + database (eMAX Health, White Plains NY). Patients were classified as mild, moderate, or severe by medication use following diagnosis, based on recommendations of the National Institutes of Health Expert Panel Report 3. They were further classified based on eosinophil levels as elevated (≥ 400 cells/μL) or normal (< 400 cells/μL). Resource use, defined as hospitalizations, ER visits, and outpatient visits, and associated costs were calculated to assess whether an economic difference existed between eosinophil groups. Non-parametric tests were used to compare resource use and associated costs between elevated and normal eosinophil groups. Multivariate modeling was performed to assess the contribution of eosinophil levels on the likelihood of study outcomes among patients with severe asthma.

- **Results**: Among the 2,164 patients meeting eligibility criteria, 1,144 had severity designations. Of these, 179 (16%) of patients had severe asthma, and among them, 20% (n = 35) had elevated eosinophils. Seventeen percent of patie

### Clozaril [^115rLRda]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Eosinophilia, defined as a blood eosinophil count of greater than 700/µL, has occurred with CLOZARIL treatment. In clinical trials, approximately 1% of patients developed eosinophilia. Clozapine-related eosinophilia usually occurs during the first month of treatment. In some patients, it has been associated with myocarditis, pancreatitis, hepatitis, colitis, and nephritis, which could be consistent with a drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms syndrome (DRESS), also known as drug-induced hypersensitivity syndrome (DIHS). If eosinophilia develops during CLOZARIL treatment, evaluate promptly for signs and symptoms of systemic reactions such as rash or other allergic symptoms, myocarditis, or other organ-specific diseases associated with eosinophilia. If CLOZARIL-related systemic disease is suspected, discontinue CLOZARIL immediately.

If a cause of eosinophilia unrelated to CLOZARIL is identified (e.g. asthma, allergies, collagen vascular disease, parasitic infections, and specific neoplasms), treat the underlying cause and continue CLOZARIL.

Clozapine-related eosinophilia has also occurred in the absence of organ involvement and can resolve without intervention. There are reports of successful rechallenge after discontinuation of clozapine without recurrence of eosinophilia. In the absence of organ involvement, continue CLOZARIL under careful monitoring. If the total eosinophil count continues to increase over several weeks in the absence of systemic disease, the decision to interrupt CLOZARIL therapy and rechallenge should be considered.

### Burden of asthma with elevated blood eosinophil levels [^1147gkRN]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Our study found that patients with severe asthma and elevated eosinophils, at ≥ 400 cells/μL, had a significantly greater number of unadjusted monthly all-cause hospital admissions. Patients with elevated eosinophils were admitted to the hospital on average about once every two years, whereas patients with normal eosinophils were admitted about once every five years. Similarly, patients with severe asthma and elevated eosinophils were admitted to the hospital about once every 1.8 years, whereas patients with severe asthma and normal eosinophils were admitted only about once every 8.3 years. These findings suggest that serum eosinophil levels can be used to risk-stratify patients with asthma, both overall and in the subset with severe asthma.

We did not find significantly greater outpatient and ER visits for the elevated eosinophil group. This indicates a stronger association between eosinophil elevation and the risk of severe exacerbations needing hospitalization, but not milder exacerbations that required only an ER or clinic visit. This difference could be explained by less successful therapeutic intervention with eosinophilia once in a state of exacerbation. The more costly hospital admissions were significantly greater compared to the normal eosinophil group. More frequent hospitalization was responsible for the greater cost for the elevated eosinophil group. Adjusted analyses show that severe asthma patients with elevated eosinophils were significantly more likely to be admitted to the hospital compared to those with normal eosinophils.

### Asthmatic adult with marked blood eosinophilia: Is it truly asthma [^111Hz7tY]? BMJ Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

Peripheral blood eosinophilia is frequently encountered in general medical and respiratory clinics. Asthma is often associated with peripheral eosinophilia; however, marked levels of eosinophilia are uncommon and should warrant further investigation. The patient described in this article presented with an initial diagnosis of allergic asthma but failed to respond to inhaled corticosteroids. Marked blood eosinophilia prompted the investigation for other eosinophilic lung diseases, which eventually yielded a diagnosis of chronic eosinophilic pneumonia (CEP). This article illustrates the importance of maintaining a high index of suspicion for eosinophilic lung diseases should patients previously diagnosed with allergic asthma fail to respond to therapy, especially if this is associated with marked blood eosinophilia.

### Eosinophilia [^112ncxLi]. Primary Care (2016). High credibility.

Eosinophilia is a condition that can be associated with various medical issues, such as eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, atopy, and eosinophilic esophagitis. It may also present with symptoms like pruritus, diarrhea, and the presence of Charcot-Leyden crystals. Other potential causes include parasitic infections, allergic reactions, and conditions like skin rash, runny nose, and increased blood eosinophil count. Additionally, eosinophilia can be linked to asthma, medications, and certain types of cancer.

### The causes of a peripheral blood eosinophilia in a secondary care setting [^117P6hke]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2021). Low credibility.

A peripheral blood eosinophilia of greater than 1.0 × 10⁹/L is relatively unusual and offers a clue to the underlying diagnosis. In 2003, we established a specialist service to diagnose unexplained eosinophilia.

- **Objective**: To describe the causes of an eosinophilia in our service and the diagnostic algorithm we developed.

- **Methods**: Subjects were referred by physician colleagues across a range of specialties and undertook standard investigations following a semi-structured protocol. Data were extracted from a bespoke database.

- **Results**: Three hundred and eighty-two subjects were referred over a 17-year period. The average age was 54 years, and 183 (48%) of subjects were female, with 21 of 25 (84%) females in the idiopathic eosinophilic pneumonia group (p < 0.001), 22 of 30 (73%) females in the gastrointestinal disease group (p < 0.008), but 11 of 37 (30%) females in the eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis group (p < 0.04). A diagnosis was assigned after systematic evaluation using a pre-defined algorithm in 361 (94.5%) of cases. Fungal allergy (82 subjects: 21%), parasitic infection (61 subjects: 16%), and severe eosinophilic asthma (50 subjects: 13%) were the three most common individual diagnoses. Hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES) disease, including eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA), accounted for 85 subjects (20%), of which seven subjects (2%) had myeloproliferative disease (M-HES). A high IgE was common, and 79 (91%) of subjects with complete data who had an IgE of ≥ 1000 IU/L had fungal allergy or parasite infection. The serum tryptase was raised in some subjects as well.

### Value of an additional review for eosinophil quantification in esophageal biopsies [^111NmL2m]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2015). Low credibility.

Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) requires a peak count of 15 eosinophils per high-power field (hpf). Herein, the peak eosinophil count specified by a pathologist was compared with the second review of a research assistant. Of 477 biopsies, 106 had a peak count between 1 and 14 eosinophils/hpf cited in the pathology report, and 23 out of 106 (22%) had ≥ 15 eosinophils/hpf on second review. The pathology report detected potential EoE with 99% specificity but 80% sensitivity. As such, an additional review of esophageal biopsies yields higher eosinophil counts in approximately 5% of cases. We propose that biopsies with a count between 1 and 14 eosinophils/hpf require further investigation because around 22% may yield a potential EoE diagnosis.

### Ccl11 as a potential diagnostic marker for asthma [^117NNEXt]. The Journal of Asthma (2014). Low credibility.

Asthma is an inflammatory airway disease characterized by airway eosinophilia, in which CCL11 (eotaxin) plays a crucial role. The aim of this study is to determine the elevation of CCL11 levels in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), blood, exhaled breath condensate (EBC), and sputum in asthma patients and to identify which medium yields the most significant change in CCL11 level.

- **Methods**: The databases of PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Centre Register of Controlled Trials were systematically searched from inception to September 2013. Controlled clinical trials that focused on CCL11 concentrations in asthma patients and controls, and their correlations with other asthma indicators, were obtained. Data were analyzed using Stata 12.0.

- **Results**: Thirty studies were included in this investigation. CCL11 levels in blood, EBC, and sputum were significantly higher in asthma patients than in healthy subjects. Sputum CCL11 concentrations were significantly elevated in unstable asthma patients versus stable asthma patients and in uncontrolled asthma patients versus partially controlled asthma patients. CCL11 levels in sputum and blood were negatively correlated with lung function as measured by FEV1% predicted and were positively correlated with BALF, EBC, and sputum eosinophil counts. Similarly, CCL11 concentrations were positively correlated with eosinophil cationic protein in EBC, blood, and sputum, as well as with interleukin-5 in sputum and fractional exhaled nitric oxide in EBC. Steroid treatment had no significant effect on CCL11 levels.

- **Conclusions**: CCL11 is potentially a valuable diagnostic marker for asthma.

### Value of peripheral blood eosinophil markers to predict severity of asthma [^115GLR8w]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

The American Lung Association reported that nearly 26 million people (84.8 per 1000) in the US suffered from asthma in 2011, with children representing 27% of them. In terms of lifetime prevalence, asthma was reported in almost 40 million people in the US in 2011 (129 per 1000). Asthma attacks were recorded in 51% of diagnosed patients, resulting in an attack rate as high as 43.1 per 1000.

The first Expert Panel Report (EPR) guidelines for asthma were established in 1991, focusing on patient education, environmental control to avoid asthma triggers, and assessment of asthma severity using lung function measures. Throughout the years, the EPR has been revised to reflect new research and novel treatment options. EPR-3 (2007) is the latest update. Disease severity is central to EPR-3 guidance, with step-therapy recommended to address an escalating need for more drugs, at higher doses, with persistently uncontrolled disease. Asthma exacerbations undoubtedly increase the clinical and economic burden to patients and payers, as emergency treatment is costlier than planned therapy, and are associated with substantial morbidity and mortality.

### Eosinopenia as an early diagnostic marker of COVID-19 at the time of the epidemic [^114C5c7y]. EClinicalMedicine (2020). Low credibility.

The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has spread rapidly worldwide since its outbreak in December 2019. COVID-19 may present with varying degrees of disease severity, ranging from asymptomatic or mild upper respiratory illness to multiple organ failure with fatal outcomes. SARS-CoV-2 is more contagious than SARS-CoV or the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Consequently, isolating suspected cases is of utmost importance to prevent the epidemic from spreading. However, similar to SARS and MERS, fever and respiratory symptoms are not unique clinical manifestations of COVID-19, despite fever occurring in the majority (83% to 98%) of diagnosed COVID-19 patients. While the definitive diagnosis of COVID-19 requires a high degree of clinical understanding of its characteristics, laboratory confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and typical pulmonary computed tomography abnormality, initial screening for COVID-19 often begins in fever clinics. Thus, it is critical for fever clinics to efficiently triage suspected COVID-19 patients from others presenting with similar symptoms, using a method that is both accurate and easily applicable. In this issue of EClinicalMedicine, Li and colleagues reported that the combination of eosinopenia (defined as a reduction of circulating eosinophils < 0.02 × 10^9/L) and elevated high-sensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP, ≥ 4.0 mg/L) can effectively triage suspected COVID-19 patients from others attending the fever clinic.

### Eosinophilia associated with immune deficiency [^1112U7av]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2022). Low credibility.

The differential diagnosis of eosinophilia is broad and includes infections, malignancies, and atopy, as well as inborn errors of immunity (IEI). Certain types of IEIs are known to be associated with elevated numbers of eosinophils and frequently elevated serum IgE, whereas for others, the degree and frequency of eosinophilia are less established. The molecular defects underlying IEI are heterogeneous and affect different pathways, which highlights the complex regulations of this cell population within the immune system.

In this review, we list and discuss clinical manifestations and therapies of immune deficiency or immune dysregulation disorders associated with peripheral blood or tissue eosinophilia with or without raised IgE levels. We present illustrative case vignettes for the most common entities and propose a diagnostic algorithm aiming to help physicians systematically evaluate patients with eosinophilia and suspicion of an underlying IEI.

### Prognostic role of blood eosinophil and basophil levels in allergic fungal rhinosinusitis (AFRS) [^113rVxGc]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2019). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the prognostic role of preoperative blood eosinophil and basophil levels in allergic fungal rhinosinusitis (AFRS), which forms a subset of chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) characterized by eosinophilic nasal polyps, allergic mucin detected in the sinuses at surgery, and specific features on computerized tomography. Despite these markers, it is still unclear which biological markers can predict disease recurrence in AFRS, and the role of blood inflammatory cells in predicting recurrence after surgery has not been fully explored.

- **Materials and methods**: A consecutive series of 17 adult patients who underwent endoscopic sinus surgery for AFRS was retrospectively assessed.

- **Results**: Sinonasal polyps recurred in 7 of 17 patients. Within the whole cohort, a significant positive correlation was observed between blood eosinophil and basophil counts, though not between blood and tissue eosinophil counts. Statistical analysis revealed significantly higher blood eosinophil and basophil levels in AFRS patients who experienced recurrence compared to those who did not.

- **Conclusions**: Given the difficulty of identifying more effective, personalized approaches to postoperative disease management in AFRS, our preliminary data suggest that blood eosinophil and basophil levels warrant further testing in larger, preferably multi-institutional, prospective investigations. These tests could be part of the preoperative work-up for AFRS patients to facilitate the administration of dedicated postoperative medical treatments.

### Eosinophils and eosinophil-associated diseases: An update [^115mhs92]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2018). Low credibility.

The goal of this series is to offer a survey of the latest literature for clinicians and scientists alike, providing a list of important recent advances relevant to the broad field of allergy and immunology. This particular assignment was to cover the topic of eosinophils. In an attempt to highlight major ideas, themes, trends, and advances relevant to basic and clinical aspects of eosinophil biology, a search of articles published since 2015 in the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology and other high-impact journals was performed. Articles were then reviewed and organized, and key findings were summarized. Given space limitations, many outstanding articles could not be included, but the hope is that what follows provides a succinct overview of recently published work that has significantly added to our knowledge of eosinophils and eosinophil-associated diseases.

### Dupilumab for COPD with type 2 inflammation indicated by eosinophil counts [^113MBLWq]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2023). High credibility.

The study BOREAS, published by Surya P. Bhatt and colleagues in 2023 in the journal *The New England Journal of Medicine*, examined chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The trial addressed the role of dupilumab in patients with COPD who had type 2 inflammation indicated by eosinophil counts.

- **Study design**: The BOREAS study was a multi-center, double-blinded, randomized controlled trial (RCT).

- **Population**: The study involved 939 patients, including 319 females and 620 males.

- **Inclusion criteria**: Participants were required to have COPD with a blood eosinophil count ≥ 300 cells/mL and an elevated exacerbation risk despite the use of standard triple therapy.

- **Key exclusion criteria**: A diagnosis of asthma or a history of asthma was grounds for exclusion.

- **Interventions**:
	- 468 participants received dupilumab (subcutaneous injection of 300 mg every 2 weeks).
	- 471 participants received a placebo (matching placebo every 2 weeks).

- **Primary outcome**: There was a significant decrease in the annualized rate of moderate or severe exacerbations (0.78 vs. 1.1; RR 0.7, 95% CI 0.58 to 0.86).

- **Secondary outcomes**:
	- Significant improvement in prebronchodilator FEV1 at week 12 (160 mL vs. 77 mL; LSMD 83, 95% CI 42 to 125).
	- Significant reduction in St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire Score at week 52 (9.7 points vs. 6.4 points; LSMD 3.4, 95% CI 1.3 to 5.5).
	- Significant reduction in evaluating respiratory symptoms in the COPD score (2.7 points vs. 1.6 points; LSMD 1.1, 95% CI 0.4 to 1.8).

- **Safety outcomes**: The study reported no significant safety concerns.

### Burden of asthma with elevated blood eosinophil levels [^115cwty8]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

An elevated eosinophil level of at least 400 cells/μL was associated with greater resource use and estimated cost in overall asthma patients as well as those with severe asthma. Adjusted analysis showed that blood eosinophil elevation was significant in predicting the probability of hospitalization among severe asthma patients on average, and the smaller group of severe asthma patients with elevated eosinophils drive healthcare expenditures. Our findings demonstrate the importance of further research to establish peripheral blood eosinophil elevation as a biomarker for disease control and overall healthcare expenditures.

### Marked and persistent eosinophilia in the absence of clinical manifestations [^117B91gR]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2014). Low credibility.

Although most patients with hypereosinophilic syndromes (HES) present with clinical signs and symptoms attributable to eosinophilic tissue infiltration, some untreated patients remain asymptomatic or have signs and symptoms, such as allergic rhinitis, for which the relationship to peripheral eosinophilia is unclear (hypereosinophilia of unknown significance [HEUS]).

- **Objective**: To identify and characterize subjects with HEUS of 5 years duration or more as compared to untreated patients with symptomatic HES and healthy normal volunteers.

- **Methods**: All subjects with eosinophilia underwent yearly evaluation, including a standardized clinical evaluation, whole blood flow cytometry to assess lymphocyte subsets and eosinophil activation, and serum collection. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were cultured overnight with and without phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate/ionomycin. Cytokines and chemokines were measured in serum and cell supernatants, and mRNA expression was assessed by using quantitative real-time PCR.

- **Results**: Eight of the 210 subjects referred for the evaluation of eosinophilia (absolute eosinophil count [AEC] > 1500/μL) met the criteria for HEUS of 5 years duration or more (range, 7–29 years). Peak eosinophil count and surface expression of eosinophil activation markers were similar in subjects with HEUS and in untreated subjects with platelet-derived growth factor alpha-negative HES (n = 28). Aberrant or clonal T-cell populations were identified in 50% of the subjects with HEUS as compared to 29% of the subjects with HES (P = 0.12). Increased levels of

### Consultation for elevated blood eosinophils: Clinical presentations, high value diagnostic tests, and treatment options [^1153dfKq]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2018). Low credibility.

The workup of a patient found to have eosinophilia should follow a thorough path with a detailed history and physical examination aimed at eliciting eosinophilic organ involvement, followed by histological confirmation whenever possible. The differential diagnosis of hypereosinophilia is extensive, but a rational approach beyond the history and physical examination — including serologic, blood, and bone marrow cell analyses, genetic testing, and radiologic imaging — can distinguish many of the causes.

Often, input from specialists (e.g. hematology, dermatology, pulmonary, gastroenterology, and neurology) can help narrow down the possibilities and eventually result in a specific diagnosis. An accurate diagnosis is key to choosing the optimal treatment for a particular condition, and this is certainly true for eosinophilic disorders. Myeloid neoplasms that present with eosinophilia, for example, may respond to medicines that the allergist may be less accustomed to using, such as immunosuppressive agents and kinase inhibitors. Similarly, newly approved biologics that target IL-5 and eosinophils may provide new options for management.

What follows is a case-based approach that helps to underscore key features of diagnosis, management, and follow-up when faced with a patient with a potential eosinophil-related disorder.

### Value of peripheral blood eosinophil markers to predict severity of asthma [^115op7hR]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Much progress has been made over the years in identifying external or environmental risk factors and triggers of asthma attacks such as allergens, pollutants, and irritants. Recently, the focus has shifted to better understanding different patient phenotypes to manage risk and optimize outcomes. In order to prevent exacerbations and progression to more severe disease, it is essential to identify modifiable risk factors for asthma control specific to patient phenotypes.

The formation of an expert group by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to classify key biological outcome measures for federally sponsored asthma research highlights an emerging priority to standardize biological markers in clinical research, thereby better evaluating patient outcomes with new and available therapeutic modalities. In the NIH Asthma Outcomes report, different biomarkers are grouped as "core", "supplemental", or "emerging". Core outcome biomarkers are required to be included in NIH-funded asthma clinical trials and observational studies, whereas supplemental biomarkers are optional.

According to the NIH Asthma Outcomes report, multi-allergen screening of IgE against different allergens is considered the only core biomarker. Blood eosinophils are a type of white blood cell that plays a role in immune responses and is responsible for inflammatory effects when triggered by allergens. Blood eosinophil measurement is recommended as a supplemental biomarker by the NIH asthma report, suggesting its optional use in NIH-funded studies.

### Elevated mepolizumab levels in patients with severe asthma responsive to 1 year's mepolizumab treatment [^111DECaq]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology. Global (2025). High credibility.

Asthma is a prevalent chronic disease characterized by variable airflow limitations and bronchial hyperresponsiveness. It is associated with persistent heterogeneous chronic inflammation of the airways, influenced by various host factors, including genetic and external factors. More than 50% of patients with asthma have eosinophilic asthma, characterized by numerous eosinophils in both the peripheral blood and airways, contributing to asthma exacerbations and airflow limitation. Although a standard definition of eosinophilic asthma remains elusive, most clinical trials have used peripheral blood eosinophil counts of ≥ 150 or ≥ 300 cells/μL to characterize eosinophilic asthma, which can be easily identified in a clinical setting.

Type 2 inflammation, mediated by type 2 cytokines such as IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13, is the underlying mechanism of eosinophilic asthma. Among these cytokines and inflammatory mediators, IL-5 plays a crucial role in various eosinophil functions. The primary cellular sources of IL-5 are T helper 2 lymphocytes and group 2 innate lymphoid cells. The biological effects of IL-5 are mediated through its selective interaction with the IL-5 receptor, IL-5R. The binding of IL-5 to IL-5Rα activates the transcription of numerous genes involved in eosinophil proliferation, differentiation, maturation, activation, and degranulation. IL-5 also works synergistically with eotaxins to recruit eosinophils to asthmatic airways. Additionally, IL-5 inhibits eosinophil apoptosis.

### Questions and answers on workup diagnosis and risk stratification: A companion document of the 2020 ESC guidelines for the management of acute coronary syndromes in patients presenting without persistent ST-segment elevation [^113SsAv4]. European Heart Journal (2021). Low credibility.

- **Q14**. A 60-year-old patient with a history of CAD presents to the emergency department with chest pain and a cough lasting for 2 days. The right-sided thoracic chest pain is persistent, moderate in intensity, non-radiating, and increases in intensity during inspiration. The last episode of chest pain started 8 hours prior to admission and the patient is still mildly symptomatic in the emergency department. He is hemodynamically stable, and the physical examination is unremarkable. The 12-lead ECG shows T-wave inversion in lead I and aVL, which were already noted in the ECG performed last year. The initial hs-cTn I Architect concentration is very low/undetectable at 2 ng/L (ULN < 26 ng/L). The emergency department intern, a bright young physician who wants to become a cardiologist, challenges you by saying that 'it is obvious that the chest pain does not represent acute MI and no additional investigations or blood tests in this respect are needed'. Is she right?

Yes. NSTEMI can be reliably ruled out with a single very low level of hs-cTn T/I, based on the delay between symptom onset and blood test. In addition, unstable angina is extremely unlikely since prolonged ischemia is expected to lead to some degree of cTn elevation. An alternative diagnosis such as pneumonia or bronchitis should be considered.

- **Q15**. You are supervising the emergency department/chest pain unit (CPU) and see an 80-year-old patient with a history of CAD, prior MI, and hypertensive heart disease presenting with persistent moderate right-sided thoracic chest pain ongoing for 7 hours that increases in intensity during inspiration.

### Proposed refined diagnostic criteria and classification of eosinophil disorders and related syndromes [^113CYWfc]. Allergy (2023). Low credibility.

When there is no familial clustering, underlying pathology, related molecular (genetic) abnormalities, or hypereosinophilia (HE)-related organ damage found in a patient presenting with HE, the provisional diagnosis "HE of unknown significance" (HE US) should be considered (Table 2, Figure 1). A diagnosis of HE US requires (a) exclusion of an underlying disease or condition that can induce HE and (b) exclusion of hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES).

Close follow-up of patients with HE US is essential, since eosinophil-related organ damage may develop after several months to years, and/or an underlying disease may become apparent over time with additional diagnostic testing. Should either of these occur, the diagnosis will change to another form of HE or HES (Figure 1).

Finally, mild eosinophilia (0.5–1.5 × 10^9/L) not meeting criteria of HE may be associated with organ dysfunction or organ damage and should, therefore, prompt the physician to initiate in-depth investigations.
