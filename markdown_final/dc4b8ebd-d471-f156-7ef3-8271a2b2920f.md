## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which observation correctly describes the titration of a weak base with a strong acid, including the shape of the pH curve and the pH at the equivalence point. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the initial pH of the weak base solution. Then, I should verify how pH changes as strong acid is added before the equivalence point. Next, I will examine the behavior near the equivalence point and determine whether the pH there is 7 or below 7. After that, I need to check the post-equivalence region. Finally, I will compare this expected pattern with the answer choices and eliminate the incorrect options one by one.

> Let me first confirm the starting point. A weak base in water produces a pH above 7, but not extremely high, because it only partially dissociates. So the initial pH is alkaline but modest, typically in the 9–11 range depending on the base strength and concentration, which means options claiming the pH starts low or increases initially are off track and can be eliminated early [^notfound].

> Wait, let me verify the early titration behavior. As strong acid is added, the weak base neutralizes the added H+ and forms its conjugate acid, so the pH declines, but the decline is initially gradual because the weak base buffers the solution. This buffering region corresponds to the formation of a weak base/conjugate acid pair and explains why the slope is shallow early on, not steep, which rules out choices that say the pH "quickly decreases" at the start [^notfound].

> Hold on, I should verify the equivalence point. At equivalence, the weak base has been fully converted to its conjugate acid, so the solution contains a weak acid and no remaining weak base. The pH at equivalence for a weak base–strong acid titration is therefore acidic, below 7, not neutral. This is a key distinction from strong acid–strong base titrations where the equivalence pH is 7, and it directly eliminates options that claim pH = 7 at equivalence [^notfound].

> I will now examine the region just before and after equivalence. Near the equivalence point, the buffering capacity of the weak base is exhausted, so the pH drops more rapidly, creating an inflection. After equivalence, excess strong acid dominates and the pH falls sharply, continuing downward. This produces a sigmoidal curve with a steeper descent around equivalence, which aligns with the expectation of a rapid decrease through and beyond equivalence [^notfound].

> Let me consider the overall shape and reconcile it with the choices. The correct pattern is: start at pH > 7, decrease slowly at first due to buffering, then decrease rapidly near equivalence, and end up at pH < 7 at equivalence. This matches option H, which states: "Initially, the pH slowly decreases, then there is a rapid decrease to give a pH below 7 at the equivalence point" [^notfound].

> But wait, what if I misremembered and the equivalence pH were neutral? I should double-check that. No, for weak base–strong acid titrations the equivalence pH is indeed acidic because the conjugate acid hydrolyzes to produce H+. Only strong acid–strong base titrations yield pH 7 at equivalence, so options B, D, and F asserting pH = 7 at equivalence are incorrect for this scenario [^notfound].

> Next, I should review the clearly wrong trajectories. Options C, E, and G describe pH increasing throughout or ending above 7, which contradicts adding acid to a base. Options A and I introduce pOH equals pKb or pKa at equivalence, which is a mix-up; those relationships pertain to different analytical contexts, not the equivalence point of this titration. Option F gets the shape right but the equivalence pH wrong, so it is close but ultimately incorrect [^notfound].

> Final answer: H. Initially, the pH slowly decreases, then there is a rapid decrease to give a pH below 7 at the equivalence point [^notfound].

---

The correct answer is **H**. Initially, the pH decreases slowly as the weak base buffers the added strong acid, then drops rapidly near the equivalence point as the buffer is exhausted, and the equivalence point pH is **below 7** because the solution contains the conjugate acid of the weak base [^notfound].

---

## Step-by-step reasoning

### Initial phase: slow pH decrease

In the initial phase, the weak base (e.g. NH₃) reacts with the added strong acid (HCl) to form its conjugate acid (NH₄⁺), which buffers the solution and slows the pH decline. The pH decreases gradually as the ratio of base to conjugate acid decreases, consistent with the Henderson–Hasselbalch relationship [^notfound].

---

### Pre-equivalence phase: gradual pH decline

Before the equivalence point, the solution is a buffer containing the weak base and its conjugate acid. The pH continues to decline slowly as more strong acid is added, with the slope of the titration curve remaining relatively gentle due to buffering.

---

### Equivalence point: rapid pH drop and acidic pH

At the equivalence point, the weak base has been fully neutralized, forming its conjugate acid. Because the conjugate acid is a weak acid, the solution is acidic, so the pH is **below 7**. The pH drops rapidly near the equivalence point as the buffering capacity is exhausted, producing a sharp inflection in the titration curve [^notfound].

---

### Post-equivalence phase: continued pH decline

After the equivalence point, excess strong acid dominates the solution, and the pH continues to decline rapidly with little buffering, resulting in a steep downward slope in the titration curve.

## Summary of titration curve characteristics

| **Phase** | **Ph behavior** | **Reason** |
|-|-|-|
| Initial | Slow decrease | Buffering by weak base and conjugate acid |
| Pre-equivalence | Gradual decline | Continued buffering |
| Equivalence | Rapid drop; pH < 7 | Exhaustion of buffer; formation of conjugate acid |
| Post-equivalence | Steep decline | Excess strong acid |

## Analysis of answer choices

- **A**: Incorrect. The pH does not decrease quickly at the start; it decreases slowly due to buffering.
- **B**: Incorrect. The equivalence point pH is not 7; it is below 7 because of the conjugate acid.
- **C**: Incorrect. The pH decreases, not increases, throughout the titration.
- **D**: Incorrect. The equivalence point pH is below 7, not 7.
- **E**: Incorrect. The pH decreases throughout, and the equivalence point is below 7.
- **F**: Incorrect. The equivalence point pH is below 7, not 7.
- **G**: Incorrect. The pH decreases, not increases, throughout the titration.
- **H**: Correct. The pH decreases slowly at first, then rapidly near the equivalence point, with the equivalence point pH below 7.
- **I**: Incorrect. The pH does not increase during the titration, and pOH does not equal pKa at the equivalence point.

---

The correct answer is **H**: Initially, the pH slowly decreases, then there is a rapid decrease to give a pH below 7 at the equivalence point.

### Disorders of acid-base balance [^fc2f8510]. Critical Care Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Intensivists spend much of their time managing problems related to fluids, electrolytes, and blood pH. Recent advances in the understanding of acid-base physiology have resulted from the application of basic physical-chemical principles of aqueous solutions to blood plasma. All changes in blood pH, in health and in disease, occur through changes in three variables: carbon dioxide, relative electrolyte concentrations, and total weak acid concentrations. However, while this quantitative approach has enjoyed widespread use among researchers, clinicians are reluctant to employ it. Recent advances have brought a measure of parity between the newer and the older, descriptive approach to acid-base physiology.

Data Synthesis

Case-based review of the literature.

Conclusion

Both quantitative and traditional approaches can be easily combined to result in a powerful tool for bedside acid-base analysis.

### Bench-to-bedside review: a brief history of clinical acid-base [^7d85f840]. Critical Care (2004). Low credibility.

The history of assessing the acid-base equilibrium and associated disorders is intertwined with the evolution of the definition of an acid. In the 1950s clinical chemists combined the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation and the Bronsted-Lowry definition of an acid to produce the current bicarbonate ion-centred approach to metabolic acid-base disorders. Stewart repackaged pre-1950 ideas of acid-base in the late 1970s, including the Van Slyke definition of an acid. Stewart also used laws of physical chemistry to produce a new acid-base approach. This approach, using the strong ion difference (particularly the sodium chloride difference) and the concentration of weak acids (particularly albumin), pushes bicarbonate into a minor role as an acid-base indicator rather than as an important mechanism. The Stewart approach may offer new insights into acid-base disorders and therapies.

### Assessing acid-base status: physiologic versus physicochemical approach [^c6fa127d]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

The physiologic approach has long been used in assessing acid-base status. This approach considers acids as hydrogen ion donors and bases as hydrogen ion acceptors and the acid-base status of the organism as reflecting the interaction of net hydrogen ion balance with body buffers. In the physiologic approach, the carbonic acid/bicarbonate buffer pair is used for assessing acid-base status and blood pH is determined by carbonic acid (ie, Paco 2) and serum bicarbonate levels. More recently, the physicochemical approach was introduced, which has gained popularity, particularly among intensivists and anesthesiologists. This approach posits that the acid-base status of body fluids is determined by changes in the dissociation of water that are driven by the interplay of 3 independent variables: the sum of strong (fully dissociated) cation concentrations minus the sum of strong anion concentrations (strong ion difference); the total concentration of weak acids; and Paco 2. These 3 independent variables mechanistically determine both hydrogen ion concentration and bicarbonate concentration of body fluids, which are considered as dependent variables. Our experience indicates that the average practitioner is familiar with only one of these approaches and knows very little, if any, about the other approach. In the present Acid-Base and Electrolyte Teaching Case, we attempt to bridge this knowledge gap by contrasting the physiologic and physicochemical approaches to assessing acid-base status. We first outline the essential features, advantages, and limitations of each of the 2 approaches and then apply each approach to the same patient presentation. We conclude with our view about the optimal approach.

### Changes in acid-base balance following bolus infusion of 20% albumin solution in humans [^5e68a55d]. Intensive Care Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate changes in acid-base balance following bolus infusions of a 20% albumin solution.

Design and Setting

Randomized prospective study in a university hospital.

Patients and Participants

Two groups of eight patients each undergoing gynecological surgery.

Interventions

Patients were randomly assigned to receive either 0.9% saline or lactated Ringer's solution. At the end of surgery two boluses of 0.5 g/kg body weight of a 20% albumin solution were administered. Arterial blood gases, electrolytes, and total protein were measured. The strong ion difference and the amount of weak plasma acid were calculated. pH and titratable acidity of the 20% albumin solution were determined.

Measurements and Results

The infusion of a 20% albumin solution resulted in a significant decrease in pH from 7.284 to 7.262 in the saline group and from 7.422 to 7.394 in the Ringer's group. In both groups the 20% albumin solution caused an increase in strong ion difference and an increase in the amount of weak plasma acid. The observed changes in serum bicarbonate concentration were in good agreement with the changes in strong ion difference and the amount of weak plasma acid. The 20% albumin solution possessed a pH of 6.95 and a titratable acidity of 8.5 mEq/l.

Conclusions

According to the Stewart approach, the observed changes in acid-base balance are the net result of the two opposing effects of the strong ion difference and the amount of weak plasma acid. Alternatively, the acidifying effect of the 20% albumin solution may stem from the titratable acid content of the solution.

### Understanding base excess (BE): merits and pitfalls [^38019cbb]. Intensive Care Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

The BB considers the non-carbonic buffers and is theoretically CO 2 -independent. Unfortunately, a physiologic inter-subject variability due to different non-carbonic buffer concentrations was noticed. To overcome this limitation, Siggaard-Andersen introduced the base excess (BE), i.e. the "excess" (either positive or negative) of the actual BB as compared to the Normal BB (NBB).

The NBB is the BB experimentally obtained through equilibration and titration procedures aimed to achieve normal conditions of pH of 7.40 and PCO 2 of 40 mmHg. Consequently, BE is the amount of acid/base (mmol/L) that must be added to the blood sample to reach pH of 7.40 in standardized conditions (PCO 2 40 mmHg, 37 °C).

As direct titration is obviously impossible in a clinical scenario, nomograms and formulae were developed to estimate BE. The most common equation, which is still in use, is the following:where 24.8 and 7.40 are the reference, ideal HCO 3 − (mmol/L) and pH values, and β is the buffer power (mmol/L) of non-carbonic weak acids, which can either be a constant value (16.2 mmol/L) or computed as a function of hemoglobin concentration (assuming a constant protein concentration of 70 g/L). The β value, multiplied by the variation in pH, provides an estimate of the change in weak negative charges due to non-carbonic buffers. Of note, from a clinical point of view, the variation in β value has a minor impact on the BE computation.

### Functional regimes define soil microbiome response to environmental change [^c38447c1]. Nature (2025). Excellent credibility.

To perturb the soil pH to desired levels, we constructed each soil's pH titration curve for the 20 soils with varying native pH to know exactly how much acid or base to add to each soil sample. To do so, separate from the main pH perturbation experiment, we added 23 different levels of HCl (acid) or NaOH (base) in the slurry, final concentrations ranging from 0–100 mM HCl or NaOH. We colorimetrically measured the pH (see section below) immediately after and 4 days after adding each well's designated amount of acid/base. Owing to natural soil's buffering capacity, it takes 1–2 days to stabilize its pH level. Thus, we used the endpoint (after 4 days) pH measurements for all pH perturbations. We did a spline interpolation on the titration data points, plotting endpoint pH (y axis) against acid or base input (x axis), to compute how much HCl and NaOH needs to be added to the soil to obtain 13 different levels of pH with ~0.4 intervals ranging from pH 3 to 9, including the pH level without the addition of any acid or base. For Soil 19 and Soil 20, we had only 7 and 3 perturbed pH levels respectively, because the strong buffering capacity of these soils (native pH over 8) limited the range of pH perturbation. We additionally tested whether the anion of acid (Cl −) or the cation of base (Na +) had a distinctive effect on the nitrate reduction dynamics, which was not the case (for results, see Extended Data Fig. 2g and Supplementary Information, 'Effect of base cation on nutrient release in soils').

### Assessing acid-base disorders [^6e983f31]. Kidney International (2009). Low credibility.

Effective management of acid-base disorders depends on accurate diagnosis. Three distinct approaches are currently used in assessing acid-base disorders: the physiological approach, the base-excess approach, and the physicochemical approach. There are considerable differences among the three approaches. In this review, we first describe the conceptual framework of each approach, and comment on its attributes and drawbacks. We then highlight the application of each approach to patient care. We conclude with a brief synthesis and our recommendations for choosing an approach.

### Strong ion difference in urine: new perspectives in acid-base assessment [^04efc178]. Critical Care (2006). Low credibility.

The plasmatic strong ion difference (SID) is the difference between positively and negatively charged strong ions. At pH 7.4, temperature 37 degrees C and partial carbon dioxide tension 40 mmHg, the ideal value of SID is 42 mEq/l. The buffer base is the sum of negatively charged weak acids ([HCO3(-)], [A-], [H2PO4(-)]) and its normal value is 42 mEq/l. According to the law of electroneutrality, the amount of positive and negative charges must be equal, and therefore the SID value is equal to the buffer base value. The easiest assessment of metabolic acidosis/alkalosis relies on the base excess calculation: buffer base(actual) - buffer base(ideal) = SID(actual) - SID(ideal). The SID approach allows one to appreciate the relationship between acid-base and electrolyte equilibrium from a unique perspective, and here we describe a comprehensive model of this equilibrium. The extracellular volume is characterized by a given SID, which is a function of baseline conditions, endogenous and exogenous input (endogenous production and infusion), and urinary output. Of note, volume modifications vary the concentration of charges in the solution. An expansion of extracellular volume leads to acidosis (SID decreases), whereas a contraction of extracellular volume leads to alkalosis (SID increases). A thorough understanding of acid-base equilibrium mandates recognition of the importance of urinary SID.

### Understanding base excess (BE): merits and pitfalls [^6a8cd3fc]. Intensive Care Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Base excess (BE) was introduced by Siggaard-Andersen in 1960 as an answer to the forty-year-long quest for a reliable, stand-alone marker of metabolic acidosis/alkalosis, independent from co-existing respiratory derangements, and able to quantify the severity of the disorder. Previously, several parameters had been examined. The first was actual bicarbonate (HCO 3 −), which was quickly discarded due to its known dependency on the partial pressure of CO 2 (PCO 2). To eliminate the respiratory component, standard bicarbonate (HCO 3 − (st)) was introduced, representing the plasma bicarbonate concentration after equilibration at a PCO 2 of 40 mmHg. Although this was certainly a step forward, HCO 3 − (st) does not take into account the buffer effect of weak non-carbonic acids, i.e. proteins, which normally contribute to buffering with 14–16 negative charges (A −) per liter. Indeed, when a strong acid is added to blood, both HCO 3 − and A − concentrations will be reduced. In an open system, which is the case of a subject properly regulating PCO 2 through breathing, carbonic buffers have a predominant role (about 75–80%), however, non-carbonic buffers cannot be disregarded completely. Therefore, the difference between HCO 3 − (st) and the ideal, "normal" bicarbonate value, slightly underestimates the acid/base added to the system (e.g. the addition of 10 mmol/L of a strong acid to blood with HCO 3 − of 24 mmol/L could result in an HCO 3 − (st) of 16 mmol/L, instead of 24–10 = 14 mmol/L). To overcome this problem, Singer and Hastings introduced the buffer base (BB), the sum of all buffer anions.

### Quantitative physical chemistry analysis of acid-base disorders in critically ill patients [^ece9e19f]. Anaesthesia (2001). Low credibility.

Compared with the Henderson-Hasselbalch approach, the Stewart approach may better describe the mechanisms of acid-base physiology and disorders. We prospectively examined the acid-base disorders of 100 routine blood samples from critically ill patients using Stewart's physical chemistry analysis. The median results were pH 7.45, PaCO2 5.5 kPa, bicarbonate 27.2 mmol.l-1 and base excess 3 mmol.l-1. The median reference strong ion difference was 46.0 meq.l-1 and the measured median was 45.5 meq.l-1. The median reference total weak-acid concentration was 11.1 mmol.l-1. The measured median total weak-acid concentration was 6.8 mmol.l-1. From Stewart's approach, the most likely explanation for the overall alkalosis was decreased total weak-acid concentration resulting from decreased plasma albumin concentration.

### The end of the bicarbonate era? A therapeutic application of the stewart approach [^10d02d03]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Unfortunately, the controversy has left many of us wondering whether it is truly important to learn the physicochemical approach. After all, intensivists really have access to only two tools for rapid manipulation of plasma pH in the setting of acidosis: 1) hyperventilation to lower P 2 and 2) administration of sodium bicarbonate. Nonetheless, our understanding of these interventions may be improved with the physicochemical approach. For example, although the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation predicts that hyperventilation will lower pH, it doesn't allow us to understand that hyperventilation does this by removing carbon dioxide without changing the strong ion difference, and it doesn't predict the effect that remaining weak acids will have on the final observed pH.

Similarly, the physicochemical approach helps us understand that administration of sodium bicarbonate increases pH by increasing the concentration of plasma sodium relative to chloride, rather than simply by adding a bicarbonate buffer to the system. This is because sodium fully dissociates in solution, whereas bicarbonate exists in equilibrium with dissolved carbon dioxide (P 2) (i.e. it behaves like a weak acid). In fact, the physicochemical approach helps us understand the potential harmful effects of a rapid bolus of sodium bicarbonate, because it predicts an increase in the local P 2. This may rapidly increase intracellular P 2, worsening intracellular acidosis, because carbon dioxide rapidly diffuses across cellular membranes.

### Acid-base homeostasis [^6414a1e0]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2015). Low credibility.

Acid-base homeostasis and pH regulation are critical for both normal physiology and cell metabolism and function. The importance of this regulation is evidenced by a variety of physiologic derangements that occur when plasma pH is either high or low. The kidneys have the predominant role in regulating the systemic bicarbonate concentration and hence, the metabolic component of acid-base balance. This function of the kidneys has two components: reabsorption of virtually all of the filtered HCO3(-) and production of new bicarbonate to replace that consumed by normal or pathologic acids. This production or generation of new HCO3(-) is done by net acid excretion. Under normal conditions, approximately one-third to one-half of net acid excretion by the kidneys is in the form of titratable acid. The other one-half to two-thirds is the excretion of ammonium. The capacity to excrete ammonium under conditions of acid loads is quantitatively much greater than the capacity to increase titratable acid. Multiple, often redundant pathways and processes exist to regulate these renal functions. Derangements in acid-base homeostasis, however, are common in clinical medicine and can often be related to the systems involved in acid-base transport in the kidneys.

### Stewart and beyond: new models of acid-base balance [^863c955b]. Kidney International (2003). Low credibility.

The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation and the base excess have been used traditionally to describe the acid-base balance of the blood. In 1981, Stewart proposed a new model of acid-base balance based upon three variables, the "strong ion difference" (SID), the total weak acids (ATot), and the partial pressure of carbon dioxide (Pco2). Over 20 years later, Stewart's physiochemical model still remains largely unknown. In this review, we will present both the traditional and the Stewart models of acid-base balance and then derive each using an "ion equilibrium method". Modern theories of acid-base balance may be useful toward the understanding of complex acid-base disorders.

### The end of the bicarbonate era? A therapeutic application of the stewart approach [^573f5591]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

However, we should be cautiously enthusiastic. Modifying pH by removing chloride and manipulating the strong ion difference will not treat the underlying cause of the acid–base disorder any more than lowering P 2 or administering sodium bicarbonate does, unless of course the primary derangement is hyperchloremia, elevated P 2, or hyponatremia. Although acidosis with hyperchloremia is quite common in critical illness, preventing hyperchloremia by using the physicochemical approach to guide the choice and composition of fluids is perhaps a simpler and wiser alternative. Furthermore, hyperventilation, sodium bicarbonate administration, and chloride electrodialysis do not directly treat elevated lactate levels, the most common cause of acidosis in critical illness. However, Zanella and colleagues make no such claims. They simply use the physicochemical approach to elegantly show that increasing the strong ion difference restores pH to normal levels. It's conceivable that the same result could be more easily obtained by conventional dialysis, where the dialysate solutions are engineered to target a given strong ion difference. Either way, the manipulation of strong ion difference to achieve specific therapeutic effects is slowly gaining traction, and similar approaches have recently been shown to enhance respiratory support. Whatever the future holds for these therapies, it behooves us to start teaching the physicochemical approach to our medical students and junior colleagues sooner rather than later.

### Strong ions, weak acids and base excess: a simplified fencl-stewart approach to clinical acid-base disorders [^39eac331]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2004). Low credibility.

Background

The Fencl-Stewart approach to acid-base disorders uses five equations of varying complexity to estimate the base excess effects of the important components: the strong ion difference (sodium and chloride), the total weak acid concentration (albumin) and unmeasured ions. Although this approach is straightforward, most people would need a calculator to use the equations. We proposed four simpler equations that require only mental arithmetic and tested the hypothesis that these simpler equations would have good agreement with more complex Fencl-Stewart equations.

Methods

We reduced two complex equations for the sodium-chloride effect on base excess to one simple equation: sodium-chloride effect (meq litre(-1)) = [Na(+)]-[Cl(-)]-38. We simplified the equation of the albumin effect on base excess to an equation with two constants: albumin effect (meq litre(-1)) = 0.25x(42-[albumin]g litre(-1)). Using 300 blood samples from critically ill patients, we examined the agreement between the more complex Fencl-Stewart equations and our simplified versions with Bland-Altman analyses.

Results

The estimates of the sodium-chloride effect on base excess agreed well, with no bias and limits of agreement of -0.5 to 0.5 meq litre(-1). The albumin effect estimates required log transformation. The simplified estimate was, on average, 90% of the Fencl-Stewart estimate. The limits of agreement for this percentage were 82–98%.

Conclusions

The simplified equations agree well with the previous, more complex equations. Our findings suggest a useful, simple way to use the Fencl-Stewart approach to analyse acid-base disorders in clinical practice.

### The meaning of acid-base abnormalities in the intensive care unit: part III – effects of fluid administration [^b90b41b4]. Critical Care (2005). Low credibility.

Stewart's quantitative physical chemical approach enables us to understand the acid-base properties of intravenous fluids. In Stewart's analysis, the three independent acid-base variables are partial CO2 tension, the total concentration of nonvolatile weak acid (ATOT), and the strong ion difference (SID). Raising and lowering ATOT while holding SID constant cause metabolic acidosis and alkalosis, respectively. Lowering and raising plasma SID while clamping ATOT cause metabolic acidosis and alkalosis, respectively. Fluid infusion causes acid-base effects by forcing extracellular SID and ATOT toward the SID and ATOT of the administered fluid. Thus, fluids with vastly differing pH can have the same acid-base effects. The stimulus is strongest when large volumes are administered, as in correction of hypovolaemia, acute normovolaemic haemodilution, and cardiopulmonary bypass. Zero SID crystalloids such as saline cause a 'dilutional' acidosis by lowering extracellular SID enough to overwhelm the metabolic alkalosis of ATOT dilution. A balanced crystalloid must reduce extracellular SID at a rate that precisely counteracts the ATOT dilutional alkalosis. Experimentally, the crystalloid SID required is 24 mEq/l. When organic anions such as L-lactate are added to fluids they can be regarded as weak ions that do not contribute to fluid SID, provided they are metabolized on infusion. With colloids the presence of ATOT is an additional consideration. Albumin and gelatin preparations contain ATOT, whereas starch preparations do not. Hextend is a hetastarch preparation balanced with L-lactate. It reduces or eliminates infusion related metabolic acidosis, may improve gastric mucosal blood flow, and increases survival in experimental endotoxaemia. Stored whole blood has a very high effective SID because of the added preservative. Large volume transfusion thus causes metabolic alkalosis after metabolism of contained citrate, a tendency that is reduced but not eliminated with packed red cells. Thus, Stewart's approach not only explains fluid induced acid-base phenomena but also provides a framework for the design of fluids for specific acid-base effects.

### The end of the bicarbonate era? A therapeutic application of the stewart approach [^aa294f1f]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Critically ill patients frequently present with disorders of acid–base homeostasis, making arterial blood gas interpretation a cornerstone activity in the clinical assessment of patients by intensivists. Many of us are unaware that we've been taught to interpret acid–base homeostasis in the "bicarbonate era", where a focus on the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation for dissociation of carbon dioxide has led us to believe that bicarbonate is a major determinant of acid–base status. However, when we try to understand some of the commonly encountered acid–base abnormalities in critical illness, such as hyperchloremia, the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation leaves us yearning for a better explanation.

Forty years ago, the Canadian physiologist Peter Stewart provided a better explanation. He described an approach to understanding acid–base in which bicarbonate is not the major determinant of acid–base status. Although it is referred to as the "modern" approach, Stewart's explanation incorporated time-tested concepts of physical chemistry, such as conservation of mass, dissociation of electrolytes, and electroneutrality, some of which date back to the 18th century. Therefore, it is perhaps more accurate to refer to Stewart's work as the physicochemical approach. Stewart applied these physicochemical principles by using simple algebra to demonstrate that plasma pH (and bicarbonate concentration) is determined by the P 2, the strong ion difference, and the concentration of weak acids (primarily albumin and phosphate).

The strong ion difference in plasma is determined by the relatively higher concentration of sodium compared with chloride, and the difference is typically about 40 mEq/L. The electroneutrality of plasma is maintained because the charge gap between these two strong ions is made up by the dissociation of weak acids into their respective anions, including the dissociation of dissolved carbon dioxide into bicarbonate. By showing that plasma proteins (weak acids) and dissolved strong ions also participate in acid–base homeostasis, the physicochemical approach provides an explanation for acid–base disorders commonly encountered in critical illness, such as hypoalbuminemia and hyperchloremia. However, although this approach is mathematically accurate, it oversimplifies some of the mechanistic insights, which is perhaps why reception has been mixed, ranging from full embracement at the bedside to outright hostility.

### Understanding base excess (BE): merits and pitfalls [^f6e7ec25]. Intensive Care Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Not all that glitters is gold

We have highlighted the usefulness and strengths of SBE, but some limitations exist and should be kept in mind in our daily practice. First, while SBE is a valuable quantitative estimate of metabolic acid–base derangements, it does not provide any information about the underlying mechanisms. Indeed, to identify the underlying pathologic mechanism we have to evaluate other variables, such as electrolytes, lactate, proteins, phosphates and clinical history. Second, SBE is a composite marker, i.e. several components contribute to its final value (e.g. chloride, lactate, albumin, ketoacids). Therefore, different components could operate in opposite directions, potentially cancelling out each other and making the interpretation of the isolated SBE value very difficult. Let us provide an example. A patient could have hyperchloremia, therefore an increase in strong anions, together with hypoalbuminemia, leading to a reduction in weak negative charges. If the reduction in negative charges due to hypoalbuminemia is equal to the increase in chloride, HCO 3 − concentration will be normal. The patient could therefore have normal acid–base parameters (pH 7.40, pCO 2 40 mmHg, HCO 3 − 24 mmol/L) yielding a perfectly normal SBE of 0 mmol/L. Is the value of SBE in this context wrong? No, it is not. The SBE correctly states that we do not need to add strong acids/bases to the sample to reach a pH of 7.40 with a PCO 2 of 40 mmHg. We are already there! However, two pathologic processes (with opposite sign) are present and would be missed if SBE was assessed on its own. Gamblegrams of other examples of multiple acid–base derangements leading to normal SBE values are summarized in Fig. 1.

### Tumor pH controls the in vivo efficacy of weak acid and base chemotherapeutics [^a32ec5ea]. Molecular Cancer Therapeutics (2006). Low credibility.

The extracellular pH of tumor tissue is significantly lower than the extracellular pH of normal tissue, whereas the intracellular pH of both tissues is similar. In principle, extracellular acidity may be expected to enhance the intracellular uptake and cytotoxicity of weak acid chemotherapeutics that are membrane permeable in their uncharged state and inhibit the efficacy of weak bases. However, procedures for assessing the role of the gradient as a determinant of drug efficacy in vivo by altering the pH gradient may also alter drug availability and thus mask or exaggerate the effect of the gradient change. In the present study, we have altered the extracellular pH of tumors and compared the effect of the resultant pH gradient change on the efficacy of a weak acid versus a weak base. This experimental design gives rise to a change in the ratio of chlorambucil- to doxorubicin-induced tumor growth delay, independent of possible changes in drug availability. The extracellular pH of the 54A human tumor in NCr/Sed/nu/nu mice was altered by administration of 5 mg/g i.v. glucose. The resultant 0.2 pH unit increase in the tumor cell pH gradient gives rise to a predicted 2.3-fold increase in the ratio of chlorambucil to doxorubicin growth delay. The experimentally measured change in the growth delay ratio was 2.1. The results provide compelling evidence that the pH gradient in a determinant of the efficacy of weak electrolytes in the complex in vivo environment and may be exploited for the treatment of cancer.

### Fluid and electrolyte management for the surgical patient [^40de09bd]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

For surgical patients, appropriate selection and administration of fluids can mitigate against organ failure, whereas improper dosing can exacerbate already injured systems. Fluid and electrolyte goals and deficiencies must be defined for individual patients to provide the appropriate combination of resuscitation and maintenance fluids. Specific electrolyte abnormalities should be anticipated, identified, and corrected to optimize organ functions. Using the strong-ion approach to acid-base assessment, delivered fluids that contain calculated amounts of electrolytes will interact with the patient's plasma charge and influence the patient's pH, allowing the clinician to achieve a more precise end point.

### Dilutional acidosis: where do the protons come from? [^040bf532]. Intensive Care Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose

To investigate the mechanism of acidosis developing after saline infusion (dilutional acidosis or hyperchloremic acidosis).

Methods

We simulated normal extracellular fluid dilution by infusing distilled water, normal saline and lactated Ringer's solution. Simulations were performed either in a closed system or in a system open to alveolar gases using software based on the standard laws of mass action and mass conservation. In vitro experiments diluting human plasma were performed to validate the model.

Results

In our computerized model with constant pKs, diluting extracellular fluid modeled as a closed system with distilled water, normal saline or lactated Ringer's solution is not associated with any pH modification, since all its determinants (strong ion difference, CO(2) content and weak acid concentration) decrease at the same degree, maintaining their relative proportions unchanged. Experimental data confirmed the simulation results for normal saline and lactated Ringer's solution, whereas distilled water dilution caused pH to increase. This is due to the increase of carbonic pK induced by the dramatic decrease of ionic strength. Acidosis developed only when the system was open to gases due to the increased CO(2) content, both in its dissociated (bicarbonate) and undissociated form (dissolved CO(2)).

Conclusions

The increase in proton concentration observed after dilution of the extracellular system derives from the reaction of CO(2) hydration, which occurs only when the system is open to the gases. Both Stewart's approach and the traditional approach may account for these results.

### Hyperchloremic acidosis in the critically ill: one of the strong-ion acidoses? [^61477d94]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2006). Low credibility.

Decreases in plasma bicarbonate are associated with hyperchloremic acidosis and lactic acidosis. According to the Stewart approach to acid-base physiology, the strong-ion difference regulates plasma bicarbonate, with chloride and lactate being the only strong anions routinely measured in clinical chemistry. We hypothesized that the plasma strong-ion difference, both with and without lactate, would have a stronger association with plasma bicarbonate than plasma chloride alone would have with bicarbonate. We used plasma acid-base data from 300 critically ill patients. The correlation with bicarbonate became progressively weaker (P < 0.001): all measured strong ions, r = 0.60; measured strong ions without lactate, r = 0.42; chloride alone, r = -0.27. In a subgroup of 26 patients with traditional hyperchloremic acidosis (base excess < -2 mmol/L and anion gap < 17 mmol/L), the measured strong-ion difference (without lactate) had a stronger correlation (P < 0.001) with bicarbonate than chloride had: r = 0.85 versus r = -0.60. We conclude that hyperchloremic acidosis and lactic acidosis are strong-ion acidoses. Hyperchloremia should be viewed relative to the plasma strong cations. A practical conclusion is that both managing and preventing acid-base disorders with IV fluid therapy involves manipulating each of the plasma strong ions, particularly sodium and chloride.

### Physicochemical analysis of blood and urine in the course of acute kidney injury in critically ill patients: a prospective, observational study [^7931c33e]. BMC Anesthesiology (2013). Low credibility.

Patients demographics, associated comorbidities, severity scores (SAPS 3 and SOFA), urine output and fluid balance, use of vasopressors, bicarbonate and loop diuretics, need for mechanical ventilation and renal replacement therapy during the observation period as well as ICU and hospital mortality were recorded.

Physicochemical approach to acid–base disturbances

In the Stewart approach, modified by Figge, the difference between strong (completely dissociated) cations and anions (SID), and Atot (the total concentration of the weak acids albumin and phosphate) are the determinants of the metabolic acid–base profile. To keep electroneutrality of the solution, water molecules dissociate when there is a decrease in SID; the resulted increment in the concentration of free protons decreases pH (an acidifying effect).

In physiological conditions, the difference between strong cations and anions (SIDa) is equal to the sum of bicarbonate and the dissociated part of weak acids (SIDe). In the presence of unmeasured anions, SIDa is greater than SIDe and this difference is called strong ion gap (SIG).

The kidneys are the major regulators of plasma SID. Normally functioning kidneys are able to counteract increases in circulating acids by increasing the net acid excretion in urine. The main mechanism for urinary acid excretion is an increase in urinary ammonium (NH 4 +), the combination of ammonia (NH 3), a metabolite of glutamine, and a proton (H +). Urinary NH 4 + is usually not directly measured but inferred by the urinary strong ion difference (SIDu): NaU + KU – ClU. To keep electroneutrality, increases in urinary NH 4 + are usually accompanied by increases in urinary Cl - concentration, decreasing the SIDu.

We calculated standard base excess (SBE), SIDa, SIDe, SIG, SIDu, fractional excretion of sodium (FENa) and urea (FEUr) using standard formulas:

### Autoregulation of H / lactate efflux prevents monocarboxylate transport (MCT) inhibitors from reducing glycolytic lactic acid production [^25c5ec1e]. British Journal of Cancer (2022). Medium credibility.

Lactic acid production is relatively insensitive to [lactate] but strongly inhibited at low pH

In order for efflux to remain constant under reduced permeability, the build-up of cytoplasmic solutes cannot block production. This was tested by measuring the time course of acidification of media titrated over a range of starting pH (6.6–7.3) and lactate concentration (0–20 mM). These modified initial conditions load the intra- and extracellular compartments with H + and/or lactate ions, revealing any inhibitory actions on glycolytic metabolism. The rate of medium acidification trended to be only mildly sensitive to starting [lactate], but decreased sharply and significantly at lower pH (Fig. 4 a). Similarly, total acid output from cells was strongly sensitive to starting pH, but only weakly reduced with higher [lactate]. These findings indicate that a cytoplasmic build-up of lactate will not block glycolysis to a significant degree, at least compared to the effect of pH. In the context of MCT inhibitors, this metabolic insensitivity to lactate would permit a steeper driving force to compensate for reduced permeability, thereby enabling autoregulation to take place.

### Treating intraoperative hyperchloremic acidosis with sodium bicarbonate or tris-hydroxymethyl aminomethane: a randomized prospective study [^9cd4af4b]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2003). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

In this study, we evaluated the action of two buffer solutions on acid-base equilibrium in cases of hyperchloremic acidosis. Twenty-four patients undergoing major gynecological intraabdominal surgery received 40 mL. kg(-1). h(-1) of 0.9% saline per protocol. During surgery, in every patient, hyperchloremic acidosis occurred. At a standard base excess of -7 mmol/L, the patients were randomly assigned to receive within 20 min either a mean of 130 ± 26 mmol of sodium bicarbonate (BIC, 1 M; n = 12) or a mean of 128 ± 18 mmol of tris-hydroxymethyl aminomethane (THAM, 3 M; n = 12). PaCO(2), pH, serum bicarbonate concentration, standard base excess, and serum concentrations of sodium, potassium, chloride, lactate, phosphate, total protein, and albumin were determined before and 0, 10, and 20 min after buffering. The apparent strong ion difference was calculated as: serum sodium plus serum potassium minus serum chloride minus serum lactate. The effective strong ion difference and the amount of weak plasma acid were calculated by using a computer program. Immediately after buffering, standard base excess increased by 9.8 mmol/L in the BIC group and by 7.2 mmol/L in the THAM group. In both groups, PaCO(2) and the amount of weak plasma acid remained constant. Mainly because of hypernatremia, the apparent and effective strong ion difference increased in the BIC group by 8.5 and 7.9 mEq/L, respectively. In the THAM group, the apparent strong ion difference remained constant; however, the effective strong ion difference increased by 6.4 mEq/L and the anion gap decreased by 5.8 mmol/L because of the occurrence of an unmeasured cation. In conclusion, in case of buffering with BIC or THAM, the changes in pH were accompanied by, and probably caused by, an increase in strong ion difference.

Implications

By comparing two groups of patients with intraoperative hyperchloremic acidosis receiving equal doses of either sodium bicarbonate or tris-hydroxymethyl aminomethane, we assessed the action of both drugs on acid-base equilibrium. In case of "buffering", the changes in pH were accompanied by, and probably caused by, an increase in strong ion difference.

### Reply by zanellato swenson [^054b79da]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

From the Authors:

We thank Dr. Swenson for the interest in our experimental study, in which we employed electrodialysis to reduce the plasma chloride concentration and correct acidemia in healthy piglets with either metabolic or respiratory acidosis. By selectively removing chloride, the main extracellular negatively charged ion, we were able to increase the plasma strong ion difference (SID), thus effectively correcting the experimentally induced acidemia. Of note, removing chloride to increase the SID is exactly what healthy kidneys do during acidemia, especially acidemia of respiratory origin. This occurs, among other mechanisms, through the downregulation of pendrin, the renal Cl − /HCO 3 − exchanger. Electrodialysis, despite its complexity, has the advantage of being faster and independent from renal function. Furthermore, as correctly pointed out, chloride removal has the straightforward advantage of correcting acidemia without changing natremia or osmolarity, as opposed to what happens with the administration of sodium bicarbonate.

Acid–base balance is undoubtedly a complex topic that has also had polarized opinions in the past, with the well-known trans-Atlantic debate between the Boston and Copenhagen schools. It is therefore not surprising that this is somehow happening again, although the current clash is between enthusiasts of the physicochemical approach (i.e. the Stewart approach) and the rest of the world.

The Stewart approach has the advantage of combining the following two very important aspects of medicine: the acid–base and the hydroelectrolyte equilibrium.

It is based on the principle that the pH of a biological solution can be varied independently by three variables: 1) P 2, 2) the SID, and 3) the total amount of noncarbonic weak acids, which in the extracellular space are mainly constituted by albumin and phosphates. The claim made by Dr. Swenson that only the strong ions determine pH and bicarbonate of a biological solution is, therefore, partially incorrect because it does not take into account P 2 and total amount of noncarbonic weak acids. Furthermore, it is important to underline that these variables are not completely independent from each other. Indeed, a certain degree of interdependence is certainly present.

### Management of acute metabolic acidosis in the ICU: sodium bicarbonate and renal replacement therapy [^1db06c60]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Metabolic acidosis is a process caused by an increase in weak acids or a decrease in strong ion difference (SID). Serum proteins, albumin, and inorganic phosphate are considered as weak acids. Strong ions, such as Na +, K +, Ca 2+, Mg 2+, and Cl −, exist at a fully ionized status in body fluids. SID is the presence of an excess of strong cations over strong anions, and the normal value in plasma is 42 mEq/l. The method to quantify metabolic acidosis using SID and weak acids was introduced by Stewart in the 1980s and still creates debate in its clinical application. Plasma base excess is widely used to identify a metabolic component of acidosis in clinical practice. The base excess approach was shown to be equivalent to Stewart's SID approach in quantifying acid–base status in critically ill patients.

Metabolic acidosis is classified into acute and chronic. Although it is not clearly defined, acute metabolic acidosis occurs within a few days. Chronic acidosis is a condition that lasts for weeks or even years. In this chapter, we focus on acute metabolic acidosis in intensive care unit (ICU) patients and provide an update from recently published clinical studies.

### Quantitative acid-base: a simplified approach for the emergency physician [^a905de98]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

A deep understanding regarding acid-base physiology has been generally absent from what is considered the skill set of Emergency clinicians. The calculations needed to obtain a solid comprehension of acid-base are thought to be too complex and time consuming, making them impractical for the chaotic environment of the Emergency Department.

Objectives

Make acid-base more approachable and accessible for the Emergency Physician.

Discussion

We present a simplified approach to quantitative acid-base, allowing clinicians to gain a general understanding of even the most complex acid-base abnormalities with minimal calculations and often with only the use of a basic chemistry profile.

Conclusions

With the utilization of a simplified quantitative acid-base model Emergency Physicians can gain a better understanding of their patients' acid-base physiology.

### Secondary responses to altered acid-base status: the rules of engagement [^81b4c8bb]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2010). Low credibility.

Each of the four canonical acid-base disorders expresses as a primary change in carbon dioxide tension or plasma bicarbonate concentration followed by a secondary response in the countervailing variable. Quantified empirically, these secondary responses are directional and proportional to the primary changes, run a variable time course, and tend to minimize the impact on body acidity engendered by the primary changes. Absence of an appropriate secondary response denotes the coexistence of an additional acid-base disorder. Here we address the expected magnitude of the secondary response to each cardinal acid-base disorder in humans and offer caveats for judging the appropriateness of each secondary response.

### Ligand design strategies to increase stability of gadolinium-based magnetic resonance imaging contrast agents [^428b1b68]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

The thermodynamic stability constant can be calculated by the equilibrium concentration of each component with the assumption that the ligand is fully deprotonated. There are several methods for the determination of log K. These include pH-potentiometry, spectrophotometry and proton relaxometry, which are respectively conducted by recording changes of pH value, absorbance/emission intensity or proton relaxivity of a solution containing equimolar amounts of metal ion and ligand as a function of added acid or base. Complexation of lanthanide(III) ions, including Gd 3+, especially with macrocyclic ligands, is generally slow. Thus, the "out-of-cell" method is frequently used rather than direct titrations, i.e. a series of samples to span the pH range are prepared and allowed to equilibrate before measurements are made. For complexes with a high log K value, the competition method can be used. This requires a competing reference ligand or metal ion. The hard acid Gd 3+ favours basic donor atoms such as nitrogen and charged oxygen, which can be exploited to increase the log K of Gd 3+ complexes. However, log K formally describes the reaction between a metal ion and a fully deprotonated ligand, with the latter only existing in solution at high pH values. At lower pH ranges, protons compete with Gd 3+ to bind with the ligand. This additional consideration is taken into account by the conditional thermodynamic stability constant: log K' (also called log K' GdL, log K cond and log K eff), a value measured at pH 7.4 using 1:1 ligand-to-metal ratio. Log K ' can be calculated from log K and ligand protonation constants. Less commonly, pGd (pGd = −log [Gd 3+] at pH 7.4, freqcuently at a ligand to metal concentration ratio of 10:1 although a range have been used in the literature) has been suggested as a measure of complex conditional thermodynamic stability. Log K ' is, therefore, more useful than log K with respect to thermodynamic stability under certain conditions, i.e. physiological pH 7.4. Increased ligand basicity results in stronger proton binding and can result in a larger difference between log K and log K'.

### Complications of regional citrate anticoagulation: accumulation or overload? [^30779116]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

Citrate and acid-base balance

Acid-base consequences of RCA are often reduced to bicarbonate generation by citrate metabolism. Unfortunately, this simplification is inaccurate and correct understanding of citrate's effect on acid-base balance requires the use of Stewart's global approach. Briefly, according to this approach, blood pH is mainly determined by three variables: PaCO 2, strong ion difference (SID), and weak acids concentration. Citrate belongs to the weak acid category and its effect should be to markedly acidify a solution. Its three carboxylate radicals have respective pKa values of 5.21, 4.28, and 2.92 at 25 °C). However, in plasma, unless the calcium level is extremely low (to levels incompatible with life), citrate is only present in the form of CCC. In that form, its acidifying capacity is limited by the binding of ionized calcium to two adjacent carboxylates, leaving only one residual anionic charge (Fig. 3). Circulating CCC therefore lead to mild plasma acidification. Under normal conditions, this effect is negligible since CCC are rapidly cleared from the blood.

Fig. 3
Citrate calcium complex. The distance between calcium's two positive charges corresponds to the distance between two citrate carboxylate radicals. A carboxylate radical remains unbound, providing residual anionic charge and a mild acidic effect. This acidifying effect would be much stronger in vitro, in the absence of ionized calcium

However, the acid-base impact of RCA is not limited to the effect of citrate itself. Indeed, the composition and amount of dialysis/substitution fluid used are of major importance. Many citrate solutions have a high sodium content (three Na + for one citrate molecule). This net sodium administration tends to increase plasma SID leading to plasma alkalinization.

Overall, when citrate catabolism is normal, RCA leads to plasma alkalinization. This alkalinizing effect is maximal with trisodium citrate solutions and less marked with ACD solutions (which have a low sodium content). To some extent, this alkalinization is desirable as it buffers acute kidney injury associated-acidosis and normalizes pH. As discussed in further sections, in some clinical situations where citrate catabolism is markedly impaired, CCC tend to accumulate, generating a mild acidosis.

### Quantitative analysis of acid-base disorders in patients with chronic respiratory failure in stable or unstable respiratory condition [^c5bf8245]. Respiratory Care (2010). Low credibility.

Background

The Stewart approach theorizes that plasma pH depends on P(aCO₂), the strong ion difference, and the plasma total concentration of non-volatile weak acids (A(tot)). The conventional approach measures standardized base excess, bicarbonate (HCO₃⁻), and the anion gap.

Objective

To describe acid-base disorders with the Stewart approach and the conventional approach in patients with chronic respiratory failure.

Methods

This was an observational prospective study in a medical intensive care unit and a pneumology ward of a university hospital. There were 128 patients included in the study, of which 14 had more than one admission, resulting in 145 admissions. These were allocated to 4 groups: stable respiratory condition and elevated HCO₃⁻ (Group 1, n = 23), stable respiratory condition and non-elevated HCO₃⁻ (Group 2, n = 41), unstable respiratory condition and elevated HCO₃⁻ (Group 3, n = 44), and unstable respiratory condition and non-elevated HCO₃⁻ (Group 4, n = 37). Elevated HCO₃⁻ was defined as ≥ 3 standard deviations higher than the mean value we found in 8 healthy volunteers. Measurements were taken on admission.

Results

In groups 1, 2, 3, and 4, the respective mean ± SD values were: HCO₃⁻ 33 ± 3 mM, 26 ± 3 mM, 37 ± 4 mM, and 27 ± 3 mM (P < .001); strong ion difference 45 ± 3 mM, 38 ± 4 mM, 46 ± 4 mM, and 36 ± 4 mM (P < .001); and A(tot) 12 ± 1 mM, 12 ± 1 mM, 10 ± 1 mM, 10 ± 2 mM (P < .001). Non-respiratory disorders related to high strong ion difference were observed in 12% of patients with elevated HCO₃⁻, and in none of those with non-elevated HCO₃⁻ (P = 0.003). Non-respiratory disorders related to low strong ion difference were observed in 9% of patients with non-elevated HCO₃⁻, and in none of those with elevated HCO₃⁻ (P = 0.02). Hypoalbuminemia was common, especially in unstable patients (group 3, 66%; group 4, 65%). Normal standardized base excess (16%), HCO₃⁻ (28%), and anion gap (30%) values were common. The Stewart approach detected high effective strong ion difference in 13% of normal standardized base excess, and in 20% of normal anion gap corrected for albuminemia, and low effective strong ion difference in 22% of non-elevated HCO₃⁻.

Conclusions

In patients with chronic respiratory failure the acid-base pattern is complex, metabolic alkalosis is present in some patients with elevated HCO₃⁻, and metabolic acidosis is present in some with non-elevated HCO₃⁻. The diagnostic performance of the Stewart approach was better than that of the conventional approach, even when corrected anion gap was taken into account.

### Acid-base interpretation: a practical approach [^62f5f180]. American Family Physician (2025). Medium credibility.

Acid-base disorders are prevalent in critically ill patients, and a systematic approach is essential for evaluation. The first step is to determine the primary process based on a patient's pH, partial pressure of carbon dioxide, and bicarbonate measurements. After this is complete, the next step is to evaluate for respiratory or metabolic compensation. Deviations from expected compensation may indicate additional acid-base processes. For metabolic acidosis, anion gap calculation distinguishes between anion gap metabolic acidosis and non-anion gap metabolic acidosis. The evaluation for anion gap metabolic acidosis includes calculating the osmolal gap and conducting a gap-gap analysis. Evaluating non-anion gap metabolic acidosis involves urine anion gap calculation. These analyses identify potential etiologies and additional acid-base disturbances. Metabolic alkalosis assessment begins with measuring urine chloride levels to determine whether the process is a result of chloride depletion. Respiratory acidosis, caused by hypoventilation, often results from chronic lung disease or neuromuscular dysfunction. Respiratory alkalosis, due to hyperventilation, is common in sepsis, chronic liver disease, and acute pulmonary embolism.

### Measurements of the size and correlations between ions using an electrolytic point contact [^e1e66bd2]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

For the sub-nanopore conductance measurements, concentrated electrolytic solutions (0.5, 1, or 2 M) were prepared first and then aliquots were diluted to the specified concentration and de-gassed in vacuum prior to the measurement. The pH was measured (in triplicate) in similarly prepared solutions. The pH measurements were calibrated against standards at pH 4, 7, and 10 (Orion #910104, 910107, 910110, Thermo Scientific). Generally, a pH near 6 was measured in all the surrogate electrolytic solutions, which was in-line with the pH measured in DI water adulterated with a drop of KCl (Supplementary Table 4). On the other hand, the solutions of concentrated 100 mM HCl all showed pH 1.

Estimates of electrolytic activity

In an ideal electrolytic solution of concentration C, ionic strength I, and activity a, the entire concentration is available for reaction, i.e. C = I = a, but for a non-ideal solution (especially at high > 100 mM concentration), ion interactions cannot be neglected. To consider what fraction of the ions are unavailable due to ion-ion electrostatic shielding, the activity coefficient, γ, is determined, where the true activity is measured by a = γ C and γ < 1. Intuitively, γ depends on concentration, but it also depends on the size of the hydrated ions, a 0 their charge, z i and the relative weighting of these parameters, which is given by empirically determined values b, A, and B. Using these values, γ can be calculated by semi-empirical extended Debye-Hückel or Truesdell-Jones formuli: i.e.depending on whether the b i I -term is included or not. Empirically, the formula extended Debye-Hückel is supposed to work best at low I whereas Truesdell-Jones is supposed to fit the data better at high I, for example. For all valence group (I) electrolytes the ionic strength I = C, but for group (II) I = 3 C due to the additional charge and also because of the additional Cl − atom per molecule. Our calculations assumed values at 25 °C: i.e. A = 0.5085 M −1/2, B = 0.3281 × 10 −8 M −1/2 m −1 and a 0 and b were given in Table 1.

### Acetazolamide-mediated decrease in strong ion difference accounts for the correction of metabolic alkalosis in critically ill patients [^4a6b48e5]. Critical Care (2006). Low credibility.

Introduction

Metabolic alkalosis is a common acid–base disturbance in the intensive care unit (ICU) that is associated with increased ICU mortality and morbidity, with adverse effects on cardiovascular, pulmonary and metabolic function. Additionally, such patients are characterized by compensatory alveolar hypoventilation, which can result in delayed weaning from mechanical ventilation. Options for treatment aimed at correcting metabolic alkalosis are fluid and potassium replacement, and administration of ammonium chloride, hydrochloric acid, or acetazolamide. These therapeutic interventions potentially increase minute ventilation, allowing patients to be weaned more rapidly.

An advanced understanding of acid–base physiology is central to the practice of critical care medicine. Although it is not difficult to quantify the degree of metabolic alkalosis, it is more challenging to identify the cause of a metabolic alkalosis and determine the actions that must be taken to correct it. The method of quantifying and qualifying an acid–base disturbance, as described by Stewart, relies on the accepted physicochemical principles of conservation of mass and electroneutrality. According to Stewart, three variables independently determine the serum hydrogen concentration. These variables are the partial carbon dioxide tension (PCO 2), the total concentration of nonvolatile weak acids (primarily serum proteins and phosphate), and the strong ion difference (SID). The Stewart approach, in contrast to other approaches, allows us to quantify an acid–base derangement as well as determine its cause.

### PH effects on measurements of ionized calcium and ionized magnesium in blood [^be7b7d95]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Context

It is well known that the concentration of ionized calcium in blood is affected by the pH of the specimen, since hydrogen ions compete with calcium for binding sites on albumin and other proteins. However, the relationship between pH and ionized magnesium concentration is not as well characterized.

Objective

To determine the effects of pH on ionized magnesium concentration over a wide range of pH values in serum or plasma.

Design

Both ionized calcium and ionized magnesium concentrations were measured in 3 sets of samples. (1) Pools of serum or whole blood at different pH values (7.20–7.60) achieved by adding a constant volume of acid or base (diluted solutions of either hydrochloric acid or sodium hydroxide) plus saline. These pools consisted of 2 serum and 3 heparinized whole blood pools collected from leftover blood remaining in clinical specimens in the Clinical Chemistry and Blood Gas Laboratories, respectively, at Duke University Medical Center. (2) Five whole blood specimens obtained from apparently healthy individual donors. (3) Twenty-six whole blood specimens obtained from individual patients (leftover blood from the Blood Gas Laboratory) in which pH was varied by in vitro loss or gain of carbon dioxide.

Results

Both ionized calcium and ionized magnesium concentrations decreased as the pH in the specimen increased, indicating the stronger binding of these ions with proteins in the more alkaline environment.

Conclusion

We conclude that the rate of change of ionized magnesium concentration with pH change (0.12 mmol/L per pH unit) is significantly less than that of ionized calcium (0.36 mmol/L per pH unit). Furthermore, our findings indicate that if adjustment to pH 7.40 is necessary, the ionized magnesium test results need to be adjusted when pH is markedly abnormal, as is sometimes done for ionized calcium.

Characterization of ZA

The mass of the synthesized substance was determined by an HR-MS-spectrum using a Thermo Finnigan LTQ-FT. A MS/MS-spectrum was recorded by CID-fragmentation on a Thermo Finnigan LCQ-Fleet (Supplementary Fig. 2). 1 H and 13 C chemical shifts and coupling networks were extracted from NMR spectra of unlabelled and 13 C fully labelled ZA and its decay products in H 2 O at 14.1 T (Supplementary Fig. 1). ZA concentration-dependent 13 C NMR acid-base titrations were performed with ZA at 37 °C in 1 M phosphate buffer at 14.1 T, adjusting the pH in random order using 1 M HCl and 1 M NaOH. Electrode pH was reported as the mean of two measurements determined directly before and after the NMR experiment with a standard pH electrode. Regular acid-base titrations of 25 mM ZA in 1 M KCl in H 2 O were performed using 1 M KOH at different temperatures. Each full titration was performed within 22 ± 1 min and a model titration curve for a diprotic acid was fitted to each titration experiment separately to extract the relevant acid dissociation constant pK a2 as a function of temperature. The temperature dependence of the acid dissociation constant ΔpK a2 /ΔT was then determined from a linear fit to the extracted data points. Hyperpolarized 13 C NMR acid-base titrations were performed with a solution of 25 mM ZA in presence of 10 mM Ca 2+ at 1 T and 27 °C. The detected pH-dependent hyperpolarized 13 C chemical shifts were compared to regular 13 C NMR acid-base titrations at 37 °C in 1 M phosphate buffer at 14 T. Stability measurements were performed by acquiring 1 H spectra at 1 T and 27 °C over 20 h, each spectrum averaged over 60 scans with a repetition time of 10 s.

### Multi-color dual wavelength vat photopolymerization 3D printing via spatially controlled acidity [^e54b5c0a]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Results and discussion

Development of multi-color resins

Inspired by the vibrant color changes obtainable in acid/base titration, we envisioned a dual wavelength approach to creating multi-color objects that relied on controlling the local acidity within a part via the use of photoacid generators (PAGs). Onium salt PAGs undergo photolysis under UV light resulting in the creation of a Brønsted acid. The strength of the generated acid depends on the counter ion species and is often designated a superacid due to bulky and weakly-coordinating anions such as hexafluoroantimonate, hexafluorophosphate, or tetrafluoroborate. We wondered if the resulting acid generation could be controlled with light dosage and allow for the protonation of pH-responsive dyes. To explore this, a pH-responsive dye, bromocresol green (BG), was chosen due to its need for only moderate pH changes and its distinct color change from blue to green to yellow (See Supplementary Fig. 1 for chemical structures). UV illumination of a solution of a PAG, triarylsulfonium hexafluorophosphate salts (TAS), BG, and aqueous 1 M NaOH (added to adjust the initial solution acidity) resulted in a distinct change in solution color from blue to green to yellow indicative of a change in solution acidity (Fig. 1A). The final solution color could be dictated by the duration of the light exposure.

### A critique of stewart's approach: the chemical mechanism of dilutional acidosis [^bde0995a]. Intensive Care Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

While Stewart's acid-base approach is increasingly used in clinical practice, it has also led to new controversies. Acid-base disorders can be seen from different viewpoints: on the diagnostic/clinical, quantitative/mathematical, or the mechanistic level. In recent years, confusion in the interpretation and terminology of Stewart's approach has arisen from mixing these different levels. This will be demonstrated on the basis of a detailed analysis of the mechanism of "dilutional acidosis". In the classical dilution concept, metabolic acidosis after resuscitation with large volumes is attributed to the dilution of serum bicarbonate. However, Stewart's approach rejects this explanation and offers an alternative one that is based on a decrease in a "strong ion difference". This mechanistic explanation is questionable for principal chemical reasons. The objective of this study is to clarify the chemical mechanism of dilutional acidosis.

Methods

Experimental data and simulations of various dilution experiments, as well as theoretical and chemical considerations were used.

Results

1. The key to understanding the mechanism of dilutional acidosis lies in the open CO2/HCO3 (-)-buffer system where the buffer base (HCO3(-)) is diluted whereas the buffer acid is not diluted (constant pCO2). 2. The categorization in independent and dependent variables depends on the system regarded. 3. Neither the principle of electroneutrality, nor a change in [SID], nor increased H2O dissociation plays a mechanistic role.

Conclusion

Stewart's approach is valid at the mathematical level but does not provide any mechanistic insights. However, the quantification and categorization of acid-base disorders, using Stewart approach, may be helpful in clinical practice.

### Porous polycarbene-bearing membrane actuator for ultrasensitive weak-acid detection and real-time chemical reaction monitoring [^fd90cc52]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Smart soft actuators are capable of mechanical reconfiguration by translating the energy contained within a chemical or physical stimulus into micro-/macroscopic change of their shape and/or size –. Current actuator devices that respond to a subtle fluctuation in environmental conditions are particularly promising for the development of more sustainable, low-power-consumption actuators and electronic systems such as highly sensitive detectors and diagnostic instruments –. Among a variety of actuation mechanisms, the solvent-stimulus represents an important one, in which the solvent diffusion into a polymer entity results in heterogeneous volume change in its body, giving rise to micro-/macroscopic shape deformation and/or adaptive movements –. In some cases, solvents may not trigger actuation directly but serve purely as fluidic carrier to transport the real stimuli, e.g. protons, to reach the site of action –. In nature, biological proton actuators such as adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-driven proton pumps on the plasma membrane expel protons to create a negative transmembrane potential and an external acidic pH environment that drives the cell expansion. These biological actuators have inspired materials scientists to develop proton-active artificial systems including responsive gels, membranes, and shape memory polymers –. Similar to most other polymer actuators, they suffer from low sensitivity. Usually a high concentration of protons in aqueous solution (≥ 10 −3 mol L −1) was required in order to produce visual shape deformation or displacement. The realization of sensitive motion at a low proton concentration is challenging and desirable for real-time monitoring of proton-related chemicals. This is particularly the case with weak acids, as they are crucial components in food and chemical industries, in agriculture, and in medicine. However, how such acidity is sensed and translated into an appropriate behavioral response (e.g. actuation or electric pulse) is poorly developed. It is especially a dilemma for actuator-based proton sensing mechanism for low limit-of-detection due to inefficient and variable ionization of weak acids in aqueous media in comparison to strong acids at the same concentration. Overall, how to build smart, ultrasensitive actuators for weak acids preferentially in aqueous media is eagerly pursued.

### Foslevodopa / foscarbidopa: a new subcutaneous treatment for Parkinson's disease [^7b1c8900]. Annals of Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Methods

Solubility Methods for Prodrugs

Approximately 2g of solids was added to 5ml of aqueous solution in a 20ml scintillation vial. The suspension was kept in a 25°C water bath while stirring for 2 hours after pH stabilization. The suspension was filtered (Acrodisc 4mm syringe filter, 0.45μm polytetrafluoroethylene membrane; Pall Life Sciences, Cortland, NY, USA). The filtrate was diluted appropriately and analyzed by high‐performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The solid residue was examined by powder X‐ray diffractometry to ensure no phase change. Water, aqueous solutions with different concentrations of acid or base were used to achieve different values of pH.

Solubility Methods forand

Suspensions were prepared by adding sufficient solids to 1ml of aqueous buffer. They were tumbled end to end for 3 days in a water bath at 25°C. After equilibration, the samples were filtered (Acrodisc 4mm syringe filter, 0.45 μm polytetrafluoroethylene membrane; Pall Life Sciences), diluted, and analyzed by HPLC. The solid residue was examined by powder X‐ray diffractometry to ensure no phase change. Different aqueous buffers were used to achieve the range of pH values for the profile.

Preparation of Formulation

In the preclinical studies, fresh foslevodopa/foscarbidopa formulations were used, dissolved in water and titrated with strong base to the target pH immediately before dosing. In the clinical study, lyophilized formulations were used at foslevodopa‐to‐foscarbidopa ratios of 4:1, 10:1, and 20:1. Foslevodopa and foscarbidopa were dissolved in water and titrated with strong base to the target pH. The solution was then lyophilized in glass vials and stoppered under vacuum. To evaluate the liquid stability of foslevodopa and foscarbidopa, liquid formulations at a ratio of 20:1 were prepared at different pH values and stoppered in low‐oxygen conditions in glass vials.

Assay Method

Assay values and the identification of foslevodopa and foscarbidopa for all samples were performed using reversed‐phase HPLC equipped with an ultraviolet detector. The samples were analyzed using gradient elution. Concentrations were determined using relative areas of the peaks in the samples compared with standard solutions.

### The AE4 transporter mediates kidney acid-base sensing [^6ffa4c1c]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Measurement of intracellular buffer capacity in β-intercalated cells

Intracellular buffering capacity (β i) was measured in individual β-intercalated cells in perfused cortical collecting ducts from Ae4 −/− and their respective Ae4 +/+ littermates. Four experimental groups were studied comparing Ae4 −/− and Ae4 +/+ mice on standard chow and on a salt-depleted diet combined with an oral alkali loading (230 mM NaHCO 3 in the drinking water) for 1 day. The protocol was similar to that described by D. Good. The tubule lumen was perfused with Cl – -free HEPES buffered solution to inhibit anion-dependent base transporters. On the bath side, a Na + -free HEPES buffered solution supplemented with 10 nM bafilomycin was used to inhibit any Na + -dependent acid base transporter and the V-type H + -ATPase. Intracellular base loading was done by adding 2.5 mM trimethylamine to the bath, which rapidly increased pH i. β i was calculated as Δ[HB +]/ΔpH i, where ΔpH i is the increase in pH i resulting from weak base addition and Δ[HB +] is the change in intracellular trimethylammonium concentration, calculated from its pKa (9.8 at 37 °C) and assuming that the concentration of trimethylamine base is equal in intracellular and extracellular fluids at steady state. β i values in individual cells were plotted as function of pH i. Linear regression of the log-transformed β i values were used to compare slopes between groups.

Pendrin activity

Pendrin activity was assessed as previously described. In short, pendrin transport rate was assessed by measuring intracellular pH with fluorescence imaging of isolated perfused cortical collecting duct (CCD) loaded with BCECF-AM (Invitrogen). In between the different groups (Ae4 +/+ and Ae4 −/− mice, treated and untreated) the intracellular buffer capacity of β-IC and their resting experimental pH i values were essentially not different (Supplementary Fig. 4a). This justifies the use of pH i rate change measurement to report about pendrin function differences. After luminal Cl − was readded to the perfusion solution, which switched back the direction of pendrin-driven Cl − /HCO 3 − exchange to HCO 3 - secretion, the intracellular pH (pH i) recovered from alkalization. The initial acidification rate reflects pendrin activity.

### Comment: balanced salt solutions for critically ill patients: nonplused and back to basics [^f5a1b08b]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2023). Medium credibility.

The analysis of trial results of the intravenous fluids pharmacodynamics revealed problems common to all studies, such as varying study designs, clinical discretion for treatments, and heterogeneous patients. We believe that in the methodology of future research it is also necessary to pay due attention to the actual rather than theoretical physicochemical parameters of the solutions used, such as osmolality, pH, and potential excess of bases. Paying attention to these parameters of intravenous fluids will be useful for assessing their role in producing pharmacodynamic effects in critically ill patients.

### Cardiovascular effects of hypertonic lactate solutions: acid-base or metabolic cause, or both? [^665d9248]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

The first point concerns the confounding acid–base effects secondary to the administration of hypertonic sodium-lactate and sodium-chloride. In the current study, the sodium-lactate and sodium-chloride groups demonstrated significant and substantial differences in pH, chloride, bicarbonate, lactate, and potassium levels. Although the authors stated that there is no hyperchloremic acidosis, we calculated an average difference in the standard base excess of − 7.4 mmol/L (−2.1 versus + 5.3) between the groups. The acid–base difference between groups is virtually entirely — barring a minimal amount of unmeasured anion in the sodium-lactate group — explained by their relative changes in chloride (see supplemental material for full calculation).

As lactate is metabolized, the strong ion difference in the sodium-lactate group rises, whereas the strong ion difference in the sodium-chloride group decreases due to hyperchloremia. This is a problematic confounder because a hypochloremia with metabolic alkalosis has a positive inotropic effect, whereas a hyperchloraemia with metabolic acidosis causes myocardial depression. Thus, the different cardiovascular effects (reflected in a different stroke volume) between these groups may well be attributed to the electrolyte or acid-base properties of the respective solutions. In fact, previous experiments in hemorrhaging canines also demonstrated the superior cardiovascular effects of hypertonic fluids with either acetate or lactate, versus unbalanced hypertonic saline. The metabolization of acetate, another organic anion, also induces alkalosis in a manner similar to that of lactate. The authors found that acetate may have a superior resuscitative profile due to its strong intrinsic vasodilatory properties and capacity to persistently restore oxygen consumption. Moreover, another study in hemorrhaging dogs showed that infused acetate was rapidly metabolized, whereas equivalent lactate loads exceeded the capacity for metabolism and caused a progressive accumulation, worsening the acid–base status and potentially the hemodynamics. These effects are also replicated in clinical studies that compared infusion of saline versus non-lactate balanced crystalloids during surgery and reported similar adverse hemodynamic effects of saline. This suggests that expanding volume with fluids with a higher strong ion difference, rather than a specific energetic or signaling profile of lactate, may be the factor driving differences in cardiovascular effects.

### Deconstructing hyperlactatemia in sepsis using central venous oxygen saturation and base deficit [^42caf369]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Hyperlactatemia and Arterial pH

According to the "strong ion" theory, lactate is a strong anion and thus should be completely dissociated from hydrogen in plasma, generating an acidosis. However, some patients with sepsis and hyperlactatemia have a concurrently decreased pH (acidemia), whereas others maintain a normal pH. This suggests mechanisms that enable relatively rapid respiratory or metabolic compensation. Gattinoni and colleagues found that the ability to maintain a normal pH despite elevated lactate levels was more closely correlated with renal function than with respiratory compensation. They propose that an indirect measure of the accumulation of renally excreted fixed acids in plasma — the "alactic base excess" — could be used to assess the kidneys' ability to compensate for acid-base disturbances.

The standard base excess, defined as the amount of strong acid that must be added to each liter of oxygenated blood to return the pH to 7.40 at a Pa CO 2 of 40 mm Hg, quantifies the degree of metabolic acidosis or alkalosis independently of respiratory compensation. Contributors to base excess include lactate, strong ions such as sodium and chloride, albumin, and ions that accumulate in renal failure, such as phosphate and sulfate. By adding lactate to the standard base excess, the authors arrive at the alactic base excess, which they assert quantifies "the role of renal function in the acid – base balance in sepsis."

This suggestion is certainly interesting but requires further thought and investigation. Renal compensation for acid–base disturbances has traditionally been considered to be slower than respiratory compensation. Detailed data on urine output, stage of acute kidney injury, minute ventilation, and other physiologic measures would be required before the relative causal effects of kidney injury in compensating for acidosis could be fully understood. The alactic base excess is not necessarily an explicit measure of renal function. For example, administration of 0.9% sodium chloride decreases the base excess, even in the presence of stable renal function and lactate concentrations. The impact of concurrent liver dysfunction requires consideration, and only a few such cases were included in the ALBIOS database. Nonetheless, the concept of alactic base excess and the role of renal function in modifying acidemia warrant evaluation in future physiologic studies.

### The rule regulating pH changes during crystalloid infusion [^edaa77b0]. Intensive Care Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose

To define the rule according to which crystalloid solutions characterized by different strong ion difference (SID) modify the acid-base variables of human plasma.

Methods

With a previously validated software, we computed the effects of diluting human plasma with crystalloid solutions ([SID] 0–60, 10 mEq/l stepwise). An equation was derived to compute the diluent [SID] required to maintain the baseline pH unchanged, at constant PCO₂ and at every dilution fraction. The results were experimentally tested using fresh frozen plasma, re-warmed at 37°C, equilibrated at PCO₂ 35 and 78 mmHg, at baseline and after the infusion of crystalloid solutions with 0, 12, 24, 36, 48 mEq/l [SID].

Results

The mathematical analysis showed that the diluent [SID] required to maintain unmodified the baseline pH equals the baseline bicarbonate concentration, [HCO₃⁻], assuming constant PCO₂ throughout the process. The experimental data confirmed the theoretical analysis. In fact, at the baseline [HCO₃⁻] of 18.3 ± 0.3 mmol/l (PCO₂ 35 mmHg) the pH was 7.332 ± 0.004 and remained 7.333 ± 0.003 when the diluting [SID] was 18.5 ± 0.0 mEq/l. At baseline [HCO₃⁻] of 19.5 ± 0.3 mmol/l (PCO₂ 78 mmHg) the pH was 7.010 ± 0.003 and remained 7.004 ± 0.003 when the diluting [SID] was 19.1 ± 0.1 mEq/l. At both PCO₂ values infusion with [SID] lower or greater than baseline [HCO₃⁻] led pH to decrease or increase, respectively.

Conclusions

The baseline [HCO₃⁻] dictates the pH response to crystalloid infusion. If a crystalloid [SID] equals baseline [HCO₃⁻], pH remains unchanged at constant PCO₂, whereas it increases or decreases if the [SID] is greater or lower, respectively.

### In vivo conditioning of acid-base equilibrium by crystalloid solutions: an experimental study on pigs [^b7697be8]. Intensive Care Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose

Large infusion of crystalloids may induce acid-base alterations according to their strong ion difference ([SID]). We wanted to prove in vivo, at constant PCO(2), that if the [SID] of the infused crystalloid is equal to baseline plasma bicarbonate, the arterial pH remains unchanged, if lower it decreases, and if higher it increases.

Methods

In 12 pigs, anesthetized and mechanically ventilated at PCO(2) ≈40 mmHg, 2.2 l of crystalloids with a [SID] similar to (lactated Ringer's 28.3 mEq/l), lower than (normal saline 0 mEq/l), and greater than (rehydrating III 55 mEq/l) baseline bicarbonate (29.22 ± 2.72 mEq/l) were infused for 120 min in randomized sequence. Four hours of wash-out were allowed between the infusions. Every 30 min up to minute 120 we measured blood gases, plasma electrolytes, urinary volume, pH, and electrolytes. Albumin, hemoglobin, and phosphates were measured at time 0 and 120 min.

Results

Lactated Ringer's maintained arterial pH unchanged (from 7.47 ± 0.06 to 7.47 ± 0.03) despite a plasma dilution around 12%. Normal saline caused a reduction in pH (from 7.49 ± 0.03 to 7.42 ± 0.04) and rehydrating III induced an increase in pH (from 7.46 ± 0.05 to 7.49 ± 0.04). The kidney reacted to the infusion, minimizing the acid-base alterations, by increasing/decreasing the urinary anion gap, primarily by changing sodium and chloride concentrations. Lower urine volume after normal saline infusion was possibly due to its greater osmolarity and chloride concentration as compared to the other solutions.

Conclusions

Results support the hypothesis that at constant PCO(2), pH changes are predictable from the difference between the [SID] of the infused solution and baseline plasma bicarbonate concentration.

### Resolving subcellular pH with a quantitative fluorescent lifetime biosensor [^8f81309d]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Numerous synthetic fluorophores have been engineered to change their fluorescence intensity in response to pH –. A substantial limitation of small molecule pH sensors is controlling where they localise inside the cell. Typically, these dyes are taken up into endosomal/lysosomal vesicles, but a number of these dyes are released from the endosomal compartment when they change their protonation state. Therefore, it is challenging to ensure the pH that is measured comes from a specific organelle. To overcome this, genetically encodable pH-sensitive proteins can be used as an alternative. These protein-based pH sensors – can be fused to proteins that natively localise to specific organelles within the cell, ensuring the pH measurement comes from the desired location. They also have the benefit of exhibiting lower toxicity than their small molecule counterparts. Most pH biosensors (protein or synthetic) measure a change in fluorescence intensity based on a change in the protonation state of the fluorophore. A limitation with all intensity-based pH sensors is decoupling the pH measurement from the concentration of the sensor. To distinguish between a high concentration of sensor with a low fluorescent signal from a low concentration of sensor with a high fluorescent signal, the pH dependant signal is typically referenced to a second pH-insensitive fluorophore. However, the necessity for the second fluorophore complicates the pH measurement through a combination of increased complexity of the sensor, FRET interactions between the fluorophores, and spectral overlap in the emission channels. Furthermore, an inherent limitation with intensity-based measurements is the drop in signal-to-noise ratio when the intensity of the pH responsive fluorophore decreases. The absolute error in each fluorescence measurement remains constant across the physiological pH range, but if the fluorescence intensity decreases at lower pH, the relative error increases substantially as the intensity approaches zero. This results in a high degree of uncertainty in the subsequent pH measurement. In addition to this, these sensors rely on interpolation from a sigmoidal curve, which has greater error in the exponential and asymptotic regions than linear regression. Both of these factors limit the useful range of the sensors to a narrow pH band, which is typically smaller than relevant physiological pH values. Many of these challenges can be overcome by using fluorescent lifetime to infer pH, as it is independent of fluorophore concentration and can quantify pH without the need for a second reference fluorophore. However, pH measurements using fluorescence lifetime have previously lacked the spatial resolution necessary to ascertain the pH of individual sub-cellular compartments with high accuracy. To overcome the limitations with existing intracellular pH measurements, here we present a pH-dependent fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (pHLIM) approach to quantitatively determine intracellular pH (Fig. 1a, b). pHLIM uses the fluorescent protein mApple, which we have observed has a pH-dependent fluorescent lifetime that is linear across the physiologically relevant pH range. By expressing mApple as a fusion protein and developing an automated deep learning analysis tool, we can accurately determine the pH of different sub-cellular compartments in live cells in real time.

### Mapping in situ the assembly and dynamics in aqueous supramolecular polymers [^4404bc13]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Next, we monitored in situ the pH evolution during titration. The pH titration curves of the three PA polymerization systems reveal clear differences in their respective [NaOH]/[PA] ranges where the transformation of micelles into polymers occurs (Fig. 3e and Supplementary Figs. 26 and 27). An abrupt decrease in the slope of [OH −] curves accompanies the onset of polymerization, whereas [OH -] increases with a nearly constant rate after the completion of polymerization, as exemplified in PA-3 assemblies (Fig. 3e, f). These results suggest that a substantial fraction of titrated hydroxide ions is consumed by the deprotonation of monomers in micelles in the transformation into supramolecular polymers. Interestingly, as we switched from PA-1 to PA-2 and then PA-3, the "buffering" effect in the pH titration curves and therefore the consumption of titrated hydroxide ions becomes less pronounced even with the same amount of titrated NaOH. The complexity of these pH titration curves (Fig. 3e) prevents us from directly extracting pKa values from the plateau regions, as done in previous studies on supramolecular gel systems –. Instead, we define the apparent p K a for each polymerization as the pH value measured at = 0.5, corresponding to an equal fraction of protonated micelles and polymers consisting of deprotonated monomers. The pKa values at [PA] = 40 µM increase from 7.85 to 8.76 and 9.60 for PA-1, PA-2, and PA-3, respectively. All these values are substantially lower than that corresponding to free lysine (p K a = 10.5), implying that stronger cohesive hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic collapse of aliphatic segments can lead to more effective deprotonation of monomers. To model the deprotonation process of micelles during transformation, we introduced an allosteric binding model to fit the normalized CD titration curves (Fig. 3a, Supplementary Text 2), by analogy to the cooperative ligand-receptor binding in biological signaling processes. In this model, the micelles containing j monomers are considered as multivalent receptors with 3 j binding sites and the NaOH is regarded as a monovalent ligand. The sequential deprotonation process is assumed to undergo via the ligand-receptor binding governed by the apparent binding constant (K'). Interestingly, the resulting Hill plots, representingas a function of, display similar Hill coefficients (n H) of around 10, corresponding to the slope at the origin of axes for all the three PA systems (Fig. 3g and Supplementary Figs. 28 and 29). A Hill coefficient significantly greater than 1 indicates a cooperative deprotonation process of micelles. Such cooperativity is expected to result in extensive deprotonation of a subset of micelles to form polymers with a negligible amount of intermediate charged states, while the remaining micelles stay fully charged. This mechanism is expected to facilitate a binary assembly model rather than a multistep assembly process, consistent with our experimental observations described above. Additionally, depending on the assumed extent of final deprotonation of micelles, the Hill coefficient of 10 suggests an estimated micelle size ranging from approximately 3 to 10 monomers. Based on this model, the tendency for deprotonation decreases as the apparent binding constant (K') decreases from 5.510 −3 µM −1 in PA-1 to 4.910 −3 µM −1 in PA-2 and 4.110 −3 µM −1 in PA-3 at [PA] = 40 μM (Fig. 3h). These results suggest that despite the identical peptide sequence in the terminal charged domain of all three monomers, their differences in ability to form strongly bonded β-sheets directly affects deprotonation and polymerization propensity.

### Relationship between acid-base status and inflammation in the critically ill [^77a42f75]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Organ dysfunction during sepsis and related conditions is generally understood to arise as a consequence both of the triggering event (for example, infection) and the host response. One of the key aspects of the host response is the production and systemic release of cytokines and other inflammatory mediators. Cytokine release is induced by a variety of signals, including those derived from pathogens (for example, endotoxin), or those related to tissue damage (for example, complement activation, ischemia-reperfusion injury and oxidative stress). These mediators, in turn, drive pro-/anti-inflammatory responses and can ultimately alter the clinical trajectory toward the resolution of the illness or result in ongoing organ damage and death.

A complex interplay between acid-base abnormalities and inflammation has been suggested. Acid-base abnormalities are common in critically ill patients and may be evaluated at the bedside using the physicochemical approach, the components of which, including the strong ion gap (SIG) may have both prognostic and treatment implications. SIG is an accurate estimator of unmeasured anions. Although evidence from cell culture and intact animals show that acidosis increases inflammation, it is unknown if a specific change in acid-base status (for example, increase in SIG or decrease in weak acids such as albumin) in humans is associated with changes in inflammatory response. It has been suggested that albumin could alter the inflammatory response by a number of ways, including scavenging and modulation of cytokine production. No study hitherto has evaluated the association between acid-base abnormalities (for example high SIG, low albumin) in critically ill humans and inflammatory mediator expression.

This study aimed to evaluate the association between various acid-base parameters and plasma inflammatory mediator expression on admission to the ICU. We hypothesized that there would be an association between acid-base status and plasma cytokines, with a greater degree of inflammation being associated with higher SIG and lower albumin. We also sought to evaluate the association between cytokine values and organ dysfunction (specifically acute kidney injury (AKI) and shock) in the first 48 hours after ICU admission.

### Adding lactate to the prime solution during hypothermic cardiopulmonary bypass: a quantitative acid-base analysis [^617d3fc0]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2003). Low credibility.

Background

The effect of adding lactate to the cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) prime was investigated using Stewart's quantitative acid-base approach. According to this quantitative model, serum pH and bicarbonate are determined by three independent factors: the partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PCO(2)), the total concentration of weak acids (e.g. albumin), and the strong ion difference. The apparent strong ion difference is calculated as the sum of sodium, potassium, magnesium and calcium minus chloride concentrations. The pH decreases with a smaller strong ion difference and vice versa.

Methods

Twenty patients scheduled for coronary surgery were studied prospectively. All patients were treated identically, except for the prime, which either contained lactate or was lactate free. Just before bypass and before coming off bypass, haemoglobin, glucose, plasma osmolality and colloid osmotic pressure were determined; albumin, lactate, sodium, potassium, ionized calcium, magnesium, phosphate, arterial pH, PCO(2), bicarbonate, and base excess were measured for use in Stewart's analysis.

Results

Metabolic acidosis had resolved by the end of bypass with the lactated prime. Although the strong ion gap (apparent minus effective strong ion difference) increased significantly in both groups, its composition differed significantly between the groups. The Stewart technique detected polyanionic gelatin as a weak acid component contributing to the unidentified anion fraction. Colloid osmotic pressure was maintained in both groups.

Conclusion

Exogenous lactate attenuates acidosis related to CPB. The oncotic and weak acid deficits produced by hypoalbuminaemia may be compensated for temporarily during CPB by polyanionic synthetic colloids such as succinylated gelatin.

### Initial effect of sodium bicarbonate on intracellular pH depends on the extracellular nonbicarbonate buffering capacity [^f0d74f40]. Critical Care Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

The effect of sodium bicarbonate on intracellular pH under conditions close to those in vivo, with both bicarbonate and nonbicarbonate buffering systems, is unknown. We postulated that this effect depends on the nonbicarbonate buffering capacity because the alkali-induced back-titration of these buffers results in a concentration-dependent release of CO2 in the extracellular space, leading to a decrease in intracellular pH.

Design

The study was conducted in two stages. First, human hepatocytes were perfused with pH 7 bicarbonate-buffered medium (5 mM HCO3-, 20 torr Pco2) containing no nonbicarbonate buffer or small amounts (5 mM 4-[2-hydroxyethyl]-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid [HEPES]) or large amounts (20 mM HEPES) of nonbicarbonate buffer. Second, the changes in intracellular pH of hepatocytes placed in acidotic human blood (pH 7, 5 mM HCO3-, 20 torr Pco2) at three hematocrits (40%, 20%, and 5%) were measured.

Setting

Research laboratory at a medical university.

Subjects

Cryopreserved human hepatocytes thawed the day before the experiments.

Interventions

Sodium bicarbonate was infused for 10 mins to increase the HCO3- concentration from 5 to 30 mM. In the second part, 20 mM sodium bicarbonate was added directly to the blood bathing the cells.

Measurements and Main Results

The intracellular pH was measured with the pH-sensitive fluorescent dye bis-carboxyethyl carboxy-fluorescein in its esterified form, acetoxy-methyl ester, by using a single-cell imaging technique. Gas analyses were performed before and during the sodium bicarbonate load. Sodium bicarbonate caused a decrease in intracellular pH with all media except the artificial medium containing no HEPES. This decrease was small in media with low nonbicarbonate buffering capacity (5 mM HEPES and 5% hematocrit blood) and large in media with high nonbicarbonate buffering capacity (20 mM HEPES and 40% hematocrit blood). The change in intracellular pH was linked closely to the change in Pco2 caused by the sodium bicarbonate.

Conclusions

The effect of sodium bicarbonate on intracellular pH depends on changes in Pco2 in the medium bathing the cells. The increase in Pco2 is correlated with the extracellular nonbicarbonate buffering capacity because of the release of H+ ions coming from the back-titration of these buffers. We conclude that sodium bicarbonate may exacerbate cell acidosis under buffering conditions close to those in vivo and that the initial changes in cell pH caused by sodium bicarbonate depend on the extracellular nonbicarbonate buffering capacity.

### Strong ion and weak acid analysis in severe preeclampsia: potential clinical significance [^ace26eea]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The influence of common disturbances seen in preeclampsia, such as changes in strong ions and weak acids (particularly albumin) on acid-base status, has not been fully elucidated. The aims of this study were to provide a comprehensive acid-base analysis in severe preeclampsia and to identify potential new biological predictors of disease severity.

Methods

Fifty women with severe preeclampsia, 25 healthy non-pregnant- and 46 healthy pregnant controls (26–40 weeks' gestation), were enrolled in this prospective case-control study. Acid-base analysis was performed by applying the physicochemical approach of Stewart and Gilfix.

Results

Mean [sd] base excess was similar in preeclamptic- and healthy pregnant women (-3.3 [2.3], and -2.8 [1.5] mEq/L respectively). In preeclampsia, there were greater offsetting contributions to the base excess, in the form of hyperchloraemia (BE(Cl) -2 [2.3] vs -0.4 [2.3] mEq/L, P < 0.001) and hypoalbuminaemia (BE(Alb) 3.6 [1] vs 2.1 [0.8] mEq/L, P < 0.001). In preeclampsia, hypoalbuminaemic metabolic alkalosis was associated with a non-reassuring/abnormal fetal heart tracing (P < 0.001). Quantitative analysis in healthy pregnancy revealed respiratory and hypoalbuminaemic alkalosis that was metabolically offset by acidosis, secondary to unmeasured anions and dilution.

Conclusions

While the overall base excess in severe preeclampsia is similar to that in healthy pregnancy, preeclampsia is associated with a greater imbalance offsetting hypoalbuminaemic alkalosis and hyperchloraemic acidosis. Rather than the absolute value of base excess, the magnitude of these opposing contributors may be a better indicator of the severity of this disease. Hypoalbuminaemic alkalosis may also be a predictor of fetal compromise.

pKa measurements

For pH titration, 100 μL, 2 µg of purified YFPs were diluted in 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 in wells of 96-well glass-bottom plates containing 100 µL of titration buffer. Titration buffers contained 100 mM citric acid/sodium citrate (pH 3–5.5), 100 mM KH 2 PO 4 /Na 2 HPO 4 (pH 6–8), or 100 mM NaOH/Glycine (pH 8.5–10). The Cytation 5 plate reader was then used to determine the emission intensity of each FP at 530/10 nm using 500/10 nm excitation light. Emission intensity versus pH was then normalized to the intensity value at pH 10. The pKa, the pH at which fluorescence is half its maximum, was determined by fitting a sigmoidal curve.

Chloride sensitivity

For the chloride titration assay, 30 μL of purified FPs were diluted to 70 μL MOPS buffer with various chloride concentrations: 0, 0.1, 0.25, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.8, 0.9, or 1 M KCl. MOPS buffer was prepared by mixing MOPS (20 mM, catalog no. M1254, Sigma-Aldrich), sodium acetate (5 mM, catalog no. S8750, Sigma-Aldrich), and Na2 EDTA (1 mM catalog no. E5134, Sigma-Aldrich) in water; pH was adjusted to 7.0. To keep the ionic strength constant, appropriate amounts of potassium gluconate (catalog no. P1847, Sigma-Aldrich) were added to make the amounts of ions in these solutions the same as that in 1.0 M KCl solution. The Cytation 5 plate reader was used to measure the fluorescence of FPs. The excitation wavelength of 508/10 nm and emission wavelength of 530/10 nm were used. Blank buffers were prepared to subtract the background fluorescence. The corrected fluorescence values were normalized to that of the 0 M KCl sample. K d for Cl - was calculated as the concentration of Cl -, when fluorescence intensity reached half its initial value.

### Ultrasensitive reversible chromophore reaction of BODIPY functions as high ratio double turn on probe [^fd694e30]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

From Supplementary Table 1, we can see an average absorption decay of 0.025 (i.e. OD A(n +1) /OD A n = 0.975) for each cycle, which means the absorption at 536 nm will decay to a half initial value at cycle 27. The solution volume will notably increase as cycle number increasing, which decreases the concentration and subsequently decreases the maximum absorption. Maybe the decay was also due to the formation of MNBOD ·Na, a strong base weak acid buffer.

The DEPT-135 (distortionless enhancement by polarization transfer) experiment is an approach to identify CH n (n = 0–3) carbons where methyl (CH 3) and methine (CH) peaks are phased in the positive direction while methylene (CH 2) phased in the negative. The DEPT-135 experiments showed that the meso -C (be denoted as "g" in Fig. 2e) of 1 shifted upfield from δ + 129.83 p.p.m. to δ + 52.73 p.p.m. with no phase change after addition of hydrazine or ethanediamine. Meanwhile, the 1 H-NMR titrations showed no total integral area change but only the upfield shift of meso -H from δ 8.16 to δ 5.38 p.p.m.; in addition, the integral area at δ 5.38 p.p.m. was dynamically complementary to δ 8.16 p.p.m. as one proton and was also proportional to the base added (Fig. 2e inset, and Supplementary Figs. 2–5). The DEPT-135 together with 1 H-NMR titration experiments indicated a possible hybridization change of the meso -C from –CH = (sp 2) to > CH– (sp 3) with no protonation or deprotonation. The possible hybridization change in NMR titrations together with the reversible large spectrophotometric change indicates possible breaking and reconstruction of the chromophore's conjugation.

### Acetazolamide-mediated decrease in strong ion difference accounts for the correction of metabolic alkalosis in critically ill patients [^e980091c]. Critical Care (2006). Low credibility.

Introduction

Metabolic alkalosis is a commonly encountered acid-base derangement in the intensive care unit. Treatment with the carbonic anhydrase inhibitor acetazolamide is indicated in selected cases. According to the quantitative approach described by Stewart, correction of serum pH due to carbonic anhydrase inhibition in the proximal tubule cannot be explained by excretion of bicarbonate. Using the Stewart approach, we studied the mechanism of action of acetazolamide in critically ill patients with a metabolic alkalosis.

Methods

Fifteen consecutive intensive care unit patients with metabolic alkalosis (pH ≥ 7.48 and HCO3- ≥ 28 mmol/l) were treated with a single administration of 500 mg acetazolamide intravenously. Serum levels of strong ions, creatinine, lactate, weak acids, pH and partial carbon dioxide tension were measured at 0, 12, 24, 48 and 72 hours. The main strong ions in urine and pH were measured at 0, 3, 6, 12, 24, 48 and 72 hours. Strong ion difference (SID), strong ion gap, sodium-chloride effect, and the urinary SID were calculated. Data (mean ± standard error were analyzed by comparing baseline variables and time dependent changes by one way analysis of variance for repeated measures.

Results

After a single administration of acetazolamide, correction of serum pH (from 7.49 ± 0.01 to 7.46 ± 0.01; P = 0.001) was maximal at 24 hours and sustained during the period of observation. The parallel decrease in partial carbon dioxide tension was not significant (from 5.7 ± 0.2 to 5.3 ± 0.2 kPa; P = 0.08) and there was no significant change in total concentration of weak acids. Serum SID decreased significantly (from 41.5 ± 1.3 to 38.0 ± 1.0 mEq/l; P = 0.03) due to an increase in serum chloride (from 105 ± 1.2 to 110 ± 1.2 mmol/l; P < 0.0001). The decrease in serum SID was explained by a significant increase in the urinary excretion of sodium without chloride during the first 24 hours (increase in urinary SID: from 48.4 ± 15.1 to 85.3 ± 7.7; P = 0.02).

Conclusion

A single dose of acetazolamide effectively corrects metabolic alkalosis in critically ill patients by decreasing the serum SID. This effect is completely explained by the increased renal excretion ratio of sodium to chloride, resulting in an increase in serum chloride.

### Extremely stable graphene electrodes doped with macromolecular acid [^cd7c14f4]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

We also tested the chemical stability by dipping HNO 3 -doped or PFSA-doped graphene into a solution of strong acid (hydrochloric acid, K a > 1), weak acid (acetic acid, K a: ~1.8 × 10 −5), weak base (ammonium hydroxide, K b: ~1.8 × 10 −5), or strong base (sodium hydroxide, K b > 1) for 15 s. R sh of HNO 3 -doped graphene greatly increased after acid and base treatments (Fig. 4b and Supplementary Table 3). Especially, R sh of HNO 3 -doped graphene after sodium hydroxide treatment was unmeasurable using the 4-point probe method; this result can be attributed to tearing of the surface of HNO 3 -doped graphene by treatment with strong base chemicals (Supplementary Fig. 6a). In contrast, the surface of PFSA-doped graphene remained smooth even in strong base solution, so R sh of this graphene increased much less than it did in HNO 3 -doped graphene (Supplementary Fig. 6b). These results demonstrate that p-type doping using macromolecular acid is stable against almost every chemical environment.

Effective strong-ion difference, sodium-corrected chloride, albumin, and nonvolatile weak acid levels in severe hyperlactatemia patients. Values for (a) the effective strong-ion difference ([SID] effective), (b) sodium-corrected chloride levels ([Cl -] corrected), (c) the albumin concentration, and (d) nonvolatile weak acid ([A tot -]) levels in patients with severe hyperlactatemia, with normal or low base excess. ✱ p < 0.05 versus the other group.

Since the normal reference intervals for plasma [Cl -] corrected are 103 to 111 mmol/l in our laboratory, most of the patients in the normal [BE] group had absolute hypochloremia (65% of the patients). Conversely, most of the patients in the low [BE] group had normal [Cl -] corrected levels (90% of the patients).

The normal [BE], [HCO 3 -], and [SID] levels were almost completely explained by the alkalinizing effect of hypochloremia. A quantitative analysis shows that the differences in mean [BE], [HCO 3 -], and [SID] values between both groups were about 8 mmol/l (lower in the low [BE] group) while the difference in the [Cl -] level was 7 mmol/l.

### 7.5% sodium bicarbonate [^1c9e434a]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

In general, it is unwise to attempt full correction of a low total CO2 content during the first 24 hours of therapy, since this may be accompanied by an unrecognized alkalosis because of a delay in the readjustment of ventilation to normal. Owing to this lag, the achievement of total CO2 content of about 20 mEq/liter at the end of the first day of therapy will usually be associated with a normal blood pH. Further modification of the acidosis to completely normal values usually occurs in the presence of normal kidney function when and if the cause of the acidosis can be controlled. Values for total CO2 which are brought to normal or above normal within the first day of therapy are very likely to be associated with grossly alkaline values for blood pH, with ensuing undesired side effects.

### Understanding base excess (BE): merits and pitfalls [^be011ff9]. Intensive Care Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Generally, BE range between − 2 and + 2 mmol/L is considered normal. Clinical examples of abnormal BE values are reported in Fig. 1.

Fig. 1
Gamblegrams of different acid–base conditions. A Normal conditions. This Gamblegram, i.e. the graph summarizing the electrical charges and the concept of electrical neutrality, represents a normal situation, with standard concentrations of electrolytes and normal acid–base parameters (HCO 3 − 24 mmol/L, PCO 2 40 mmHg and pH of 7.40), leading to a SBE of 0 mmol/L. B Lactatemia. In this situation, lactate concentration is increased by 6 mmol/L and pH is 7.31. Other electrolytes and PCO 2 have normal values. HCO 3 − concentration is decreased to 20 mmol/L and BE is − 6 mmol/L. This is an example of isolated metabolic acidosis. C Hypochloremia. In this situation, chloride concentration is decreased by 5 mmol/L and pH is 7.47. Other electrolytes and PCO 2 have normal values. HCO 3 − concentration is increased to 29 mmol/L and BE is + 5 mmol/L. This is an example of isolated metabolic alkalosis, which can frequently be observed in case of persistent vomiting or after administration of loop diuretics. D Lactatemia and sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO 3). In this situation, lactate concentration is increased by 10 mmol/L and sodium concentration is increased by 10 mmol/L due to the administration of NaHCO 3. Other electrolytes and PCO 2 have normal values. As the increase in cations is equal to the increase in anions, no other change in electrolytes is required to fulfill the electroneutrality principle, i.e. HCO 3 − concentration is unaffected (24 mmol/L) and pH is 7.40. Therefore, two acid–base disorders co-exist and cancel each other out. Consequently, the calculated SBE is 0 mmol/L. Of note, the columns are higher than normal, underlining the fact that sodium-bicarbonate administration causes an increase in osmolarity. E Hyponatremia, hypochloremia and ketoacids. In this situation, sodium and chloride concentrations are reduced by 20 and 30 mmol/L, respectively. At the same time, 10 mmol/L of ketoacids are present. Also in this case, variations in strong cations and anions cancel out each other and, assuming a normal PCO 2 of 40 mmHg, normal values of pH and HCO 3 − are expected, leading to a normal SBE of 0 mmol/L. This acid–base derangement can be observed in infants with hypertrophic pyloric stenosis, where electrolyte losses due to persistent vomiting can coexist with hypovolemia and starvation ketoacidosis.

### Healthy housing reference manual [^47c2ed1b]. CDC (2006). Medium credibility.

Water testing equipment for pools and spas — essential monitoring is outlined, stating that correct equipment should be used and maintained to assess water quality and that equipment should test for chlorine, bromine, pH, alkalinity, hardness, and cyanuric acid build up. The chlorine should be measurable at a range of 0 to 10 parts per million (ppm), and water pH levels should be accurately measured with an acid or base test. A kit to check pool chemical levels usually includes DPD tablet tests for free and total chlorine and other one-step tablet tests for pH, total alkalinity, calcium hardness, and cyanuric acids. Paper test strips with multiple tests, including chlorine, bromine, and pH, are available but the reliability of these tests varies greatly, and if used they should be kept fresh, protected from heat and moisture, and checked against other test systems periodically if water quality problems persist.

### Will esophageal impedance replace pH monitoring? [^e95dae96]. Pediatrics (2007). Low credibility.

Esophageal impedance, a technique based on the fact that the passage of a bolus changes the impedance between esophageal segments, is being used more and more. Multiple esophageal impedance combined with pH monitoring is advocated to become the preferred technique to measure acid and nonacid gastroesophageal reflux. Compared with pH monitoring, impedance has the advantage of being independent of pH and, as a consequence, is better adapted to measure reflux (especially in the postprandial period when reflux is buffered) and detect symptoms associated with nonacid- or weakly acid-reflux episodes. Conversely, the analysis of an impedance tracing requires more time and knowledge than a pH tracing and is possibly subjected to higher interobserver variability. Day-to-day reproducibility and interobserver variability are considerable. Episodes detected only by pH monitoring or impedance are numerous in pediatrics; therefore, pH monitoring and impedance should be associated in analyses of multiple esophageal impedance combined with pH monitoring. Up to now, there has been a striking absence of literature showing attempts to link data from diagnostic procedures to clinical outcome in symptomatic patients. Furthermore, data suggesting that impedance does offer a clear-cut benefit in pediatric clinical routine are missing. High cost of the material and the investment in time necessary for interpretation of the recording remain a handicap. However, because pH monitoring is part of impedance technology, it is likely that the latter will soon replace pH monitoring despite the current need of scientific evidence demonstrating a relation between symptoms, esophageal damage or response to reflux treatment, and results of multiple esophageal impedance combined with pH monitoring.

### In vitro thermal profile suitability assessment of acids and bases for thermochemical ablation: underlying principles [^36f838a4]. Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose

To measure and compare temperature changes in a recently developed gel phantom for thermochemical ablation as a function of reagent strength and concentration with several acids and bases.

Materials and Methods

Aliquots (0.5–1 mL) of hydrochloric acid or acetic acid and sodium hydroxide or aqueous ammonia were injected for 5 seconds into a hydrophobic gel phantom. Stepwise increments in concentration were used to survey the temperature changes caused by these reactions. Injections were performed in triplicate, measured with a thermocouple probe, and plotted as functions of concentration and time.

Results

Maximum temperatures were reached almost immediately in all cases, reaching 75 degrees C-110 degrees C at the higher concentrations. The highest temperatures were seen with hydrochloric acid and either base. More concentrated solutions of sodium hydroxide tended to mix incompletely, such that experiments at 9 M and higher were difficult to perform consistently.

Conclusions

Higher concentrations for any reagent resulted in higher temperatures. Stronger acid and base combinations resulted in higher temperatures versus weak acid and base combinations at the same concentration. Maximum temperatures obtained are in a range known to cause tissue coagulation, and all combinations tested therefore appeared suitable for further investigation in thermochemical ablation. Because of the loss of the reaction chamber shape at higher concentrations of stronger agents, the phantom does not allow complete characterization under these circumstances. Adequate mixing of reagents to maximize heating potential and avoid systemic exposure to unreacted acid and base must be addressed if the method is to be safely employed in tissues. In addition, understanding factors that control lesion shape in a more realistic tissue model will be critical.

### Resolving subcellular pH with a quantitative fluorescent lifetime biosensor [^03b54e28]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Discussion

Intensity-based pH measurements are hampered by the inherent drop in signal when the sensors are in their low-intensity state. Measuring the intensity of sensors when the signal has dropped to < 10% of the original signal (and sometimes < 1%) results in elevated levels of uncertainty in the pH measurement. It is important to note that the uncertainty in the inferred pH comes from both the intensity/lifetime measurement, and the pH calibration. This latter source of uncertainty is often ignored, but can significantly affect the accuracy of the measurement. When modelling the sigmoidal response of intensity to pH, the exponential and asymptotic regions of the curve have substantially higher uncertainty than the linear region. This is exemplified by the interpolation of pH from the intensity of muGFP, pHluorin and mApple (Fig S3). For each of these fluorophores, the uncertainty in pH is substantially higher than if the lifetime of mApple is used for pH calibration. This uncertainly can be > 1 pH unit, which greatly limits the application of intensity measurements to determine physiologically relevant pH changes. Furthermore, the need for a reference fluorophore that is truly pH insensitive along with potential complications with FRET makes it difficult to ensure intensity-based measurements accurately reflect the true pH. mApple exhibits a large (1 ns), linear shift in its fluorescence lifetime in response to changes in environmental pH. The linear response of mApple fluorescent lifetime within the physiological pH range makes pH interpretation simpler and less prone to high levels of uncertainty compared to previously reported lifetime sensitive fluorophores. Using the fluorescent lifetime decouples the pH measurement from the concentration of the sensor, eliminating the need for a reference fluorophore and associated ratiometric analysis. Despite mApple exhibiting reduced intensity at lower pH, the lifetime measurements have the same level of certainty across the physiological pH range, resulting in < 0.1 pH uncertainty in the measurements on a per-pixel basis. The increased accuracy of the pH measurements using pHLIM means we can identify pH changes with a high degree of certainty as soon as subtle changes occur (as per treatment with BafA1 — Fig. 4) and definitively demonstrate when no changes occur (as per treatment with PEI — Fig. 5).

### Local ionic transport enables selective PGM-free bipolar membrane electrode assembly [^42884827]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Determination of the concentration of K + and carbonate ions

We determined the concentration of K + ions in the anolyte by using the dynamic equivalent point titration technique performed by Metrohm 848 Titrino Plus instrument. Specifically, 20 mL anolyte samples before and after the stability test were continuously stirred in a beaker, where a pH probe was immersed in the solution to record the pH changes while 0.1067 M HCl solution was dosed into the solution via a syringe pump. The volume of HCl dosage was recorded during the titration. The equivalent point is determined from the steepest change of pH profile as a function of the acid dosage. Because the anolyte after stability contains CO 3 2− species, there will be several equivalent points due to the CO 3 2 — HCO 3 — H 2 CO 3 equilibrium reaction. The equivalent point at pH = ~ 4 indicates that all the anions in the solution were replaced with Cl - from the acid and helped us estimate the total K + concentration in the anolyte. The total K + ion concentration can be calculated from the below equation:Whererepresents the concentration of the HCl solution, represents the acid dosage, andrepresents the volume of the sample for titration.

To determine the carbonate concentration in the used anolyte, we introduced excess 2 mL 1 M BaCl 2 solution into 30 mL anolyte after stability test to remove CO 3 2− ions from the liquid system by precipitating all the CO 3 2− ions in the form of BaCO 3. Because the pH is above 12 for the anolyte after stability test, we can safely conclude that only OH - and CO 3 2− were present in the anolyte. We separated the solid precipitate from the solution by using a centrifuge and collected the supernatant for the titration following the same steps as described above to determine the concentration of OH −. Then we can estimate the concentration of CO 3 2− from the following equations:

The proportion of current associated with K + and CO 2 crossover over total ionic current in the stability test was calculated using the following equations:

The ionic current is the same to the total current.is the number of charges for the ions: 1 for K + and 2 for carbonate ions.represents the change in the number of moles of the ions, which is a function of volume of the anolyte before and after stability test as well as concentrations of the ions before and after stability test. The concentrations of K + and carbonate ions are determined from the titration described above.

### The base excess gap is not a valid tool for the quantification of unmeasured ions in cardiac surgical patients: a retrospective observational study [^78103162]. European Journal of Anaesthesiology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

The base excess gap (BE(gap)) method is commonly used for the quantification of unmeasured ions in critically ill patients. However, it has never been validated against the standard quantitative acid-base approach.

Objective

To compare the BE(gap) as a tool for the prediction of the excess of unmeasured ions with the offset of strong ion gap (SIG) from its reference value.

Design

A retrospective observational study.

Setting

Adult ICU in a tertiary hospital.

Patients

One hundred and thirty-five cardiac surgical patients admitted for postoperative care.

Interventions

None.

Main Outcome Measures

BE(gap) was calculated as BE(gap) = SBE - BE(si) - BE(wa), where SBE is the standard base excess, BE(si) is the partition due to strong ions ([Na+]-[Cl-]-[lactate-] - 30.5) and BE(wa) is the partition due to weak acids [0.25×{42 - (albumin)}]. The deviation of the observed SIG (SIG(ob)) from its reference value was calculated as deltaSIG = 2.85 - SIG(ob). We used Bland-Altman and concordance correlation analysis to compare BE(gap) with deltaSIG. A bias of ± 1 meq l(-1) with limits of agreement of ± 2 meq l(-1) and a concordant correlation coefficient of more than 0.9 were considered to indicate a strong agreement.

Results

The concordant correlation coefficient between BE(gap) and deltaSIG was 0.702. The mean bias between the two variables was 1.8 meq l(-1), with a lower limit of agreement of -0.9 meq l(-1) and an upper limit of agreement of 4.4 meq l(-1).

Conclusion

The BE gap method cannot reliably quantify the unmeasured ion excess in cardiac surgical patients. Clinicians should use the full Stewart-Figge model for quantitative acid-base assessments.

### Stewart's physicochemical approach in neurosurgical patients with hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis during propofol anesthesia [^1d65d6a1]. Journal of Neurosurgical Anesthesiology (2008). Low credibility.

There is both in vitro and clinical evidence that high-dose propofol can inhibit mitochondrial respiration, resulting in metabolic acidosis. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of propofol anesthesia on the acid-base status in neurosurgical patients with large amount of normal saline administration. Thirty patients undergoing clipping of cerebral aneurysm were randomly assigned to receive propofol (n = 15) or isoflurane (n = 15). Propofol dose (mean ± standard error) infused for maintenance was 5.7 ± 0.2 mg/kg/h in propofol group. Acid-base parameters such as PaCO2, pH, serum bicarbonate concentration, standard base excess, serum electrolyte concentration, total protein, albumin, lactate, and phosphate were measured before and 4 hours after the induction of anesthesia, and after surgery. The apparent strong ion difference (SIDa), the effective SID (SIDe), and the amount of weak plasma acid were calculated using the Stewart equation. There were no significant differences in pH, PaCO2, bicarbonate, and lactate between 2 groups throughout the whole investigation period. After surgery, standard base excess significantly decreased in both groups without intergroup difference. SIDa and SIDe significantly decreased in both groups, and lactate and strong ion gap significantly increased after surgery in propofol group, but there were no significant differences between 2 groups. Both propofol and isoflurane were associated with hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis in neurosurgical patients with large amount of normal saline administration. The acid-base balance between the 2 anesthetics was similar using Stewart's physicochemical approach.

### British society of gastroenterology guidelines for oesophageal manometry and oesophageal reflux monitoring [^5525baf2]. Gut (2019). Medium credibility.

Technical aspects of wireless pH monitoring

3.1 Wireless pH monitoring should be undertaken for at least 48 hours, as this increases the number of patients found to have excess acid exposure and the number of symptoms available for symptom association analysis.

GRADE evidence: High

Strength recommendation: Strong

Wireless pH monitoring is better tolerated than catheter based monitoring, producing less interference with daily activities, eating, sleeping and work. Prolonged studies (> 24 hours) are therefore feasible and acceptable to patients. It is also recognised that there can be considerable day to day variability in oesophageal acid exposure and symptom reporting, and a more prolonged period of pH monitoring can potentially produce a higher diagnostic yield. Analysis of the second 24 hour period of a 48 hour wireless pH study confirms this, increasing the proportion of patients with a pathological acid exposure time by 12.4% and doubling the symptoms reported, leading to a change in symptom association in 20% of patients. Similar analyses found that the proportion of patients with a pathological acid exposure time increased by 22%, and 12.5% with the addition of a second 24 hours to the monitoring period. A 20% rate of pathological acid exposure during the second 24 hours of a wireless pH study was also reported in a group of patients with proton pump inhibitor refractory reflux symptoms, a normal upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and normal acid exposure and symptom index for the first 24 hours.

There may also be an enhanced symptom correlation with a 48 hour versus a 24 hour study, perhaps due to a decreased effect of sedation during endoscopy with a longer study. Significantly increased SAP scores for reflux symptoms have been reported during the second 24 hours compared with the first 24 hours. Wireless pH monitoring should therefore be undertaken for at least 48 hours.

3.2 Wireless pH monitoring can be undertaken for up to 96 hours, if the capsule has not detached and the results at 48 hours are indeterminate, but both 'worst day' and 'average' analyses should be undertaken to determine a diagnosis of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease.

GRADE evidence: Moderate

Strength recommendation: Conditional/weak

Given that a more prolonged period of oesophageal pH recording provides more information for analysis, it would seem logical that, if the results at the end of a standard 48 hour recording period are indeterminate, a further recording period is undertaken. Extending the recording period for wireless pH monitoring up to 96 hours has been shown to increase diagnostic yield, both in terms of abnormal oesophageal acid exposure and symptom association.

### The reproducibility of stewart parameters for acid-base diagnosis using two central laboratory analyzers [^28429704]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Acid-base derangements can be interpreted using the Stewart-Fencl approach, which includes calculation of the apparent strong ion difference (SID(app)), the effective SID (SID(eff)), and the strong ion gap (SIG). These calculations require the measurement of several variables. We hypothesized that the SID and SIG calculated by different analyzers would not be reproducible because of variability in the measured values.

Methods

In this prospective observational study conducted in a biochemistry laboratory, we analyzed 179 routine blood samples from consecutive patients over a 3-mo period using two automated blood chemistry analyzers, the LX20 (Beckman) and the Modular (Roche). Measured and calculated parameters from the two analyzers were compared.

Results

Although the correlation between measured values was satisfactory, there were large differences in the limits of agreement for calculated values (SID(app): 9.6 mEq/L, SID(eff): 6.4 mEq/L, and SIG: 11.7 mEq/L) and a weak correlation (SID(app): r(2) = 0.54 and SIG: r(2) = 0.12) between the analyzers.

Conclusions

The results of the Stewart-Fencl approach for interpretation of acid-base status can vary according to the analyzer used. These differences may have important clinical and research implications.

### Error, reproducibility and uncertainty in experiments for electrochemical energy technologies [^91857c3d]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Contemporary electrochemical instrumentation can routinely offer a current resolution and accuracy on the order of femtoamps; however, one electron looks much like another to a potentiostat. Consequently, the practical limit on measurements of current is the scientist's ability to unambiguously determine what causes the observed current. Crucially, they must exclude interfering processes such as modified/poisoned catalyst sites or competing reactions due to impurities.

As electrolytes are conventionally in enormous excess compared to the active heterogeneous interface, electrolyte purity requirements are very high. Note, for example, that a perfectly smooth 1 cm 2 polycrystalline platinum electrode has on the order of 2 nmol of atoms exposed to the electrolyte, so that irreversibly adsorbing impurities present at the part per billion level (nmol mol −1) in the electrolyte may substantially alter the surface of the electrode. Sources of impurities at such low concentration are innumerable and must be carefully considered for each experiment; impurity origins for kinetic studies in aqueous solution have been considered broadly in the historical literature, alongside a review of standard mitigation methods. Most commercial electrolytes contain impurities and the specific 'grade' chosen may have a large effect; for example, one study showed a three-fold decrease in the specific activity of oxygen reduction catalysts when preparing electrolytes with American Chemical Society (ACS) grade acid rather than a higher purity grade. Likewise, even 99.999% pure hydrogen gas, frequently used for sparging, may contain more than the 0.2 μmol mol −1 of carbon monoxide permitted for fuel cell use.

The most insidious impurities are those generated in situ. The use of reference electrodes with chloride-containing filling solutions should be avoided where chloride may poison catalystsor accelerate dissolution. Similarly, reactions at the counter electrode, including dissolution of the electrode itself, may result in impurities. This is sometimes overlooked when platinum counter electrodes are used to assess 'platinum-free' electrocatalysts, accidentally resulting in performance-enhancing contamination; a critical discussion on this topic has recently been published. Other trace impurity sources include plasticisers present in cells and gaskets, or silicates from the inappropriate use of glass when working with alkaline electrolytes. To mitigate sensitivity to impurities from the environment, cleaning protocols for cells and components must be robust. The use of piranha solution or similarly oxidising solution followed by boiling in Type 1 water is typical when performing aqueous electrochemistry. Cleaned glassware and electrodes are also routinely stored underwater to prevent recontamination from airborne impurities.

### Rapid evaluation of bioactive Ti-based surfaces using an in vitro titration method [^d2592f88]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Discussion

Although the titration using 20 mM calcium solution at a rate near 0.1 mL/min could seem to be slow, it should be noted that the nucleation event observed in the current experiments is a kinetically limited process. Due to a particularly low-solubility limit of HA, by the end of the first minute during titration, the solution is already supersaturated toward HA. In practice, the solubility limit is greatly increased for smaller HA particles due to curvature effects. Generally, the high energy barrier for HA nucleation helps to maintain stability in many metastable solutions including the standardized SBF, which is able to stay stable without precipitation of HA in detectable quantities for at least a month. If we compare with the standard SBF, we find that after 40–45 min of titration the solution has surpassed the supersaturation level in SBF (σ HA = 13.62), shown in Fig. 7. Although the two systems are rather different with different concentrations of Tris-HCl and particularly different Ca to P ratios (a starting phosphate concentration of 4 mM for titration vs. 1 mM in SBF), this time point can still be a general reference point and contrasts greatly with the very high level of supersaturation at the major nucleation events in homogeneous nucleation and in the cases where introduced materials have little effect on neither the pathway nor the rate of CaP nucleation. In fact, before reaching ~180 min where the first nucleation event is observed, if the titration is stopped, eventually the solution will precipitate CaP. By mixing 50 mL P solution with 5 mL Ca solution (corresponding to 65 min in the titration curve), short-term stability is achieved but an obvious precipitation event occurred after 10 h of mixing, as observed in the free calcium profile (Supplementary Fig. 15). Therefore, a consistent titration rate has to be used when comparing different materials. Some practical considerations for the use of the titration method is given in Supplementary Discussion. A titration experiment using commercially available hydroxyapatite particles is also presented for comparison (Supplementary Fig. 20).

### Rational design of aptamer switches with programmable pH response [^a8ccf7cb]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

We describe here a general strategy that should make it possible to convert virtually any aptamer into a pH-responsive switch that can be tuned to selectively undergo a dramatic shift in affinity under acidic, neutral, or alkaline conditions. We achieve this pH specificity by introducing two orthogonal modes of control that can be manipulated in parallel to tune sensitivity to different pH conditions without altering the core sequence of the aptamer itself. Our approach builds on the intramolecular strand displacement aptamer design, in which an aptamer is covalently linked to a partially complementary displacement strand (DS) through an inert DNA linker. We indirectly manipulate aptamer pH dependence by inserting pH-responsive DNA motifs into either the linker or the DS. In comparison to previously described motif-based approaches, this design minimizes sequence constraints and enables broader tuning of our design. Using this strategy, we have generated an array of pH-responsive strand displacement (PSD) aptamer switches, all based on the same core aptamer sequence, that have been engineered to preferentially bind or release their molecular target under various pH conditions. Our most responsive designs exhibit up to a 1000-fold change in affinity over the narrow range between pH 5.5 and pH 7, greatly exceeding the sensitivity of previously reported pH-responsive aptamer switch designs. In addition to generating switches that are broadly responsive to low or high pH, we also describe the design of a PSD switch, the affinity of which, unlike existing pH-responsive aptamers, undergoes a significant enhancement within a narrow pH "window." To our knowledge, this represents the first description of an engineering strategy for producing such constructs. Since the aptamer sequence itself is not being manipulated in these constructs, our design strategy is broadly applicable to a wide range of aptamers, allowing for the ready integration of pH response into a variety of aptamer-based molecular devices.

### Acid-base disturbances after cardiac surgery: a cohort study using the physicochemical approach [^dc38c022]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

Metabolic acidosis is a common complication following cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). Recent evidence suggests that unmeasured anions (UAs), assessed via the strong ion gap (SIG), may play a significant role. This study aimed to explore acid-base changes using the Stewart physicochemical model to better characterize the contribution of UAs in the early postoperative period.

Design

Single-center, prospective observational study.

Setting

A tertiary university hospital in Italy.

Participants

Fifty adult patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery with CPB. The inclusion criteria were: elective cardiac surgery with CPB and written informed consent. The exclusion criteria were emergency surgery, heart transplant or ventricular assist device implantation, pregnancy, and lack of informed consent.

Interventions

Blood samples were collected at predefined perioperative time points for comprehensive acid-base analysis, including traditional parameters and Stewart-derived variables: apparent and effective strong ion difference, total weak acids, SIG, and alactic base excess. Statistical comparisons were performed using paired tests and repeated-measures analysis of variance.

Measurements and Main Results

At ICU arrival, patients exhibited significant metabolic acidosis (mean pH 7.33 ± 0.05, BE -3.87 ± 3.3 mmol/L), elevated lactate (2.52 mmol/L), and a markedly increased SIG (median 9.8 mmol/L v 6.0 at baseline, p < 0.001). Despite normalization of pH by postoperative day 1, the presence of elevated SIG indicated that UAs significantly contributed to early acidosis, independent of hyperlactatemia. Alactic base excess also revealed persistent non-lactic metabolic derangements.

Conclusions

The Stewart approach reveals a substantial role for unmeasured anions in postoperative metabolic acidosis after cardiac surgery. These findings challenge the reliance on lactate and base excess alone and suggest a potential role for advanced acid-base analysis in guiding postoperative care.

### Direct assessment of the acidity of individual surface hydroxyls [^ee113ef8]. Nature (2021). Excellent credibility.

The state of deprotonation/protonation of surfaces has far-ranging implications in chemistry, from acid-base catalysis 1 and the electrocatalytic and photocatalytic splitting of water 2, to the behaviour of minerals 3 and biochemistry 4. An entity's acidity is described by its proton affinity and its acid dissociation constant pK a (the negative logarithm of the equilibrium constant of the proton transfer reaction in solution). The acidity of individual sites is difficult to assess for solids, compared with molecules. For mineral surfaces, the acidity is estimated by semi-empirical concepts, such as bond-order valence sums 5, and increasingly modelled with first-principles molecular dynamics simulations 6,7. At present, such predictions cannot be tested-experimental measures, such as the point of zero charge 8, integrate over the whole surface or, in some cases, individual crystal facets 9. Here we assess the acidity of individual hydroxyl groups on In 2 O 3 (111)-a model oxide with four different types of surface oxygen atom. We probe the strength of their hydrogen bonds with the tip of a non-contact atomic force microscope and find quantitative agreement with density functional theory calculations. By relating the results to known proton affinities of gas-phase molecules, we determine the proton affinity of the different surface sites of In 2 O 3 with atomic precision. Measurements on hydroxylated titanium dioxide and zirconium oxide extend our method to other oxides.

### Optimal perfusion targets in cardiogenic Shock [^3d1d2206]. JACC: Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

Metabolic acidosis caused by lactic acidosis from tissue hypoperfusion and anaerobic metabolism, compounded by AKI and reduced hepatic LC, is the most common acid-base abnormality seen in CS. Acidosis may further impair cardiovascular function and worsen hemodynamics through reduced vasopressor responsiveness, decreased cardiac contractility, and altered systemic vascular resistance. There are a number of ways to quantify metabolic acidosis including base deficit, anion gap, and strong ion gap. Of particular interest in the CS cohort is base deficit or the amount of base required to titrate a liter of arterial blood to a pH of 7.40. Attana et allooked at 63 patients with CS following ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction and found that a greater base deficit was seen among nonsurvivors, but there were no detectable differences in anion gap or strong ion gap. A study examining the prognostic value of serum bicarbonate on 28-day mortality in a cohort of AMI-CS found that baseline serum bicarbonate was higher, and base deficit lower, in survivors compared to nonsurvivors. Interestingly, bicarbonate levels were seen to decrease before a significant rise in lactate occurred. Furthermore, incrementally lower baseline bicarbonate levels were associated with progressively higher mortality rates. Serum bicarbonate and base deficit may be additional prognostic markers in CS. However, their utility as another potential target of resuscitation remains uncertain.

### Causes of metabolic acidosis in canine hemorrhagic shock: role of unmeasured ions [^e6464671]. Critical Care (2007). Low credibility.

Results

One animal died from myocardial failure during shock induction and two animals dropped out during resuscitation and observation due to premature death, leaving eight dogs for final statistical analysis. Measured and calculated values of the acid-base status throughout the course of the experiment are presented in Table 1. During induction of shock, arterial pH decreased significantly from 7.41 to 7.19. An additional decrease in pH to 7.13 was observed after completion of resuscitation. pH had increased at 30, 60, and 180 minutes after therapy but remained lower than the baseline value. pCO 2 increased transiently at the end of resuscitation and 30 minutes after therapy. It did not show major deviations from baseline at other times of the protocol. Directional changes in base excess were similar to changes in pH. Plasma concentrations of sodium, potassium, calcium, and magnesium did not show major deviations from the respective baseline values. The plasma concentration of chloride increased significantly 60 and 180 minutes after therapy. Serum lactate increased significantly from 1.5 mEq/L (baseline) to 5.5 mEq/L after shock induction and remained elevated until 30 minutes post-therapy. The SID a decreased significantly after completion of resuscitation and remained so post-therapy. The serum concentration of phosphate did not show major deviations from baseline. Due to hemorrhage and dilution with colloid solutions, the serum concentration of albumin decreased significantly after shock induction and remained decreased 30, 60, and 180 minutes post-therapy. The SID e decreased earlier than the SID a (after induction of shock) and remained significantly decreased until the end of the experiment.

### Whither the bicarbonate era [^e8d32d00]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

To the Editor:

For metabolic acidosis, beyond treating the underlying cause, correcting hypoxemia, and establishing good perfusion, sodium bicarbonate is often given at variable arbitrary thresholds of depressed blood pH. Recently, Zanella and colleagues employed extracorporeal removal of chloride by electrodialysis in healthy pigs made acidemic by either lactic acid infusion or hypoventilation (CO 2 retention). By physically drawing off chloride and establishing a local separation of charge, blood electroneutrality at the membrane is immediately reestablished by the hydrolysis of water to yield a hydroxyl ion that instantly combines with CO 2 to form bicarbonate. The authors show the feasibility of quantitatively increasing bicarbonate in this fashion for both forms of acidosis without the associated and unwanted hypernatremia and volume loading that can occur with intravenous sodium bicarbonate administration. The accompanying editorialists proclaim the postbicarbonate era with this study that illustrates a major tenet of the Stewart approach to acid–base chemistry and its superiority over other approaches to understanding acid–base physiology and pathophysiology. In Stewart's paradigm, H +, OH −, HCO 3 −, and CO 3 2− are relegated to the status of dependent variables; that is, they can only be formed from the differential movements and exchanges of independent strong ions (Na +, K +, and Cl −) that disturb electroneutrality, which is immediately corrected by the hydrolysis of water and reaction with CO 2. Although the heuristics of the Stewart analysis are valid, I remain unconvinced by the claim that what the mathematics of this approach reveal demands that physiology must follow these rules and conclusions. The assumption that only strong ions and their differential movement from one space to another alters H + and HCO 3 − concentrations because the math is consistent with it goes against all we know about numerous cell-membrane transporters that use H +, HCO 3 −, or CO 3 2− as coions or counterions with Na +, K +, and Cl −. There has been no identification of a Na + /Cl − antiporter or an electrogenic Na + -Cl cotransporter that will alter local electroneutrality to create or consume the supposed dependent variables. Simply because one can electrodialyze chloride by brute force, as Zanella and colleagues report, does not mean it happens in vivo at the microscopic level. Clinical adoption of the Stewart approach has shown no superiority to conventional approaches, and the measurement of all the strong ions repeatedly is wasteful and costly, risks measurement errors that beget more testing, contributes to anemia in many patients, contributes to more transfusions, and is very difficult to teach to trainees and even seasoned clinicians.

Textual explanation

The presence of liquid and/or gas reflux is measured by the oesophageal impedance technique, and intraoesophageal acid exposure time is measured by 24-hour ambulatory pH monitoring. The combination of these modalities allows us to analyse the effect of acidic, weakly acidic and non-acidic reflux on oesophageal junctional mucosal pathophysiology.

In general, intraoesophageal acid exposure time is known to be associated with the degree of oesophageal mucosal injury. Recent studies suggest that mucosal injury is caused by immunological mechanisms triggered by inflammatory mediators or cytokines that are released from oesophageal mucosal cells by stimulation with acid. There is an argument whether pH monitoring data truly reflect the acidic environment because the pH probe used for 24-hour pH monitoring is placed 5 cm above the GOJ, not at the GOJ itself. However, it is known that the acidic environment 5 cm above the GOJ reflects the true environment at the GOJ well. It is also known that intraoesophageal acid exposure time (pH < 4) results in columnar epithelialisation with increased expression of intestinal differentiation factors such as CDX1, CDX2 and BMP4 in oesophageal epithelial cells and stromal cells, respectively. Therefore, measurement of intraoesophageal acid exposure time by 24 hour pH monitoring is useful for analysing oesophageal junctional mucosal pathophysiology as a method of predicting columnar epithelialisation. In fact, it has been reported that intraoesophageal acid exposure time is an important factor determining the length of Barrett's mucosa. Regarding liquid and/or gas reflux, not only an acidic environment (pH < 4) but also a weakly acidic environment (pH > 4) is assumed to affect oesophageal junctional mucosal pathophysiology. It has been reported that a weakly acidic environment (pH > 4) enhanced mucosal permeability, which results in dilation of intraepithelial spaces (DIS). Experimentally, even a weakly acidic environment (pH > 4) is known to release inflammatory mediators such as ATP from oesophageal mucosal cells. However, the mechanisms of how a weakly acidic, as well as an acidic, environment induces mucosal permeability, mucosal impedance and metaplastic change are unknown.

### 8.4% sodium bicarbonate [^8b1e5ff6]. FDA (2021). Medium credibility.

Dosage and Administration

Sodium Bicarbonate Injection, USP is administered by the intravenous route.

In cardiac arrest, a rapid intravenous dose of one to two 50 mL vials (44.6 to 100 mEq) may be given initially and continued at a rate of 50 mL (44.6 to 50 mEq) every 5 to 10 minutes if necessary (as indicated by arterial pH and blood gas monitoring) to reverse the acidosis. Caution should be observed in emergencies where very rapid infusion of large quantities of bicarbonate is indicated. Bicarbonate solutions are hypertonic and may produce an undesirable rise in plasma sodium concentration in the process of correcting the metabolic acidosis. In cardiac arrest, however, the risks from acidosis exceed those of hypernatremia.

In infants (up to two years of age), the 4.2% solution is recommended for intravenous administration at a dose not to exceed 8 mEq/kg/day. Slow administration rates and the 4.2% solution are recommended in neonates, to guard against the possibility of producing hypernatremia, decreasing cerebrospinal fluid pressure and inducing intracranial hemorrhage.

In less urgent forms of metabolic acidosis, Sodium Bicarbonate Injection, USP may be added to other intravenous fluids. The amount of bicarbonate to be given to older children and adults over a four-to-eight-hour period is approximately 2 to 5 mEq/kg of body weight — depending upon the severity of the acidosis as judged by the lowering of total CO2 content, blood pH and clinical condition of the patient. In metabolic acidosis associated with shock, therapy should be monitored by measuring blood gases, plasma osmolarity, arterial blood lactate, hemodynamics and cardiac rhythm. Bicarbonate therapy should always be planned in a stepwise fashion since the degree of response from a given dose is not precisely predictable. Initially an infusion of 2 to 5 mEq/kg body weight over a period of 4 to 8 hours will produce a measurable improvement in the abnormal acid-base status of the blood. The next step of therapy is dependent upon the clinical response of the patient. If severe symptoms have abated, then the frequency of administration and the size of the dose may be reduced.

### Cellular conditions of weakly chelated magnesium ions strongly promote RNA stability and catalysis [^30d0f9a0]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Effects of free amino acids on RNA folding and catalysis in vitro are generally considered to be inhibitory. For instance, discoveries of amino acid-sensing RNAs including the lysine riboswitch, arginine riboswitch, and glutamine riboswitch revealed that a simple amino acid can bind tightly to the specific loops in the riboswitches and change local RNA structures –. Furthermore, self-splicing of the group I intron is inhibited by arginine;, myriad RNA secondary and tertiary structures are destabilized in proline; and arginine, lysine, and betaine — an analog of glycine — destabilize tertiary interactions in a group I intron. In contrast, general effects of amino acids on RNA function under in cellular conditions are largely unknown.

Herein, we investigate the catalysis and folding of several functional RNAs in the presence of amino acid-chelated magnesium under cellular conditions. We test activity of HDV-like, hammerhead, and glmS self-cleaving ribozymes, which are widely found in the three domains of life, with amino acid-chelated magnesium –. The HDV-like ribozyme is one of the best studied ribozymes: it folds into a pseudoknot structure through two co-axial stacks and employs general acid-base catalysis for the self-cleavage reaction utilizing metal ion and nucleobase catalysis (Supplementary Fig. 2). Binding of magnesium is essential not only for RNA catalysis in many ribozymes but also for RNA folding. An NMR study and Tb 3+ -induced cleavage assay suggests up to eight magnesium ions could bind with the CPEB3 ribozyme and several of these sites are important for folding. In addition, in the hammerhead and glmS ribozymes, Mg 2+ serves folding and catalysis roles.

To analyze the effects of metal ions on RNA folding, stability, and catalysis under cellular conditions, we focus on interactions between the most prevalent divalent ion and metabolites, magnesium ion and amino acids, respectively. Every amino acid has one carboxylate group, which is deprotonated at cellular pH and enables association with Mg 2+. Although the affinity of amino acids for magnesium is relatively weak (in the millimolar range), this interaction is still detectable by titration and NMR experiments in aqueous systems and accounts for ~15 mM of all chelated Mg 2+ (see Results) –. We asked whether such weakly chelated magnesium can affect RNA folding and catalysis. Herein, we report that weakly bound magnesium strongly promotes RNA folding, stability, and catalysis, which affect nearly every biological process involving RNA.

### Resolving subcellular pH with a quantitative fluorescent lifetime biosensor [^ac84d50d]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

mApple calibration

For the pH calibration, 5 µL of 75 µM mApple protein was combined with 120 µL of relevant pH buffer in a black 96-well clear bottom plate. For ionic strength calibration, 2x PBS (300 mM ionic strength) was used to create solutions of relevant ionic strengths by dilution with MilliQ water before combining mApple with these buffers in the ratio outlined above. The plate was then imaged on a LEICASP8X FALCON Confocal system as mentioned above. System was pre-warmed to 37 °C in the focal plane just above the surface of the plate. Fast fluorescence lifetimes (Fig. 1c) were calculated by applying a bin of 8 to the captured image then processing according to Eq. (2). In the case of the G value calibration (Fig. 1g), a bin of 8 was applied to the captured image and the phasor G coordinates were averaged according to Eq. (3).G value calibration was fit with linear regression and 95% prediction bands were plotted in Prism. For the intensity calibration (Fig. 1f), intensity values from the acquired images were normalised to the maximum value at pH 7.4, then data was fitted to a four-parameter logistic sigmoidal fit in Prism. 95% prediction bands were plotted using prism. Uncertainty in the pH measurement for the intensity and G value calibrations were determined from the 95% asymmetric confidence interval.

### Lactate versus non-lactate metabolic acidosis: a retrospective outcome evaluation of critically ill patients [^bfa4ba3c]. Critical Care (2006). Low credibility.

Measurements, calculations, and classification of metabolic acidosis

All samples were analyzed in the hospital's central laboratory (Vitros 950; Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics, Raritan, NJ, USA) or blood gas laboratory (Radiometer-ABL 725; Radiometer, Copenhagen, Denmark) for processing. Serum samples were collected in a serum separator tube and sent to the central laboratory for processing. Blood gas samples were collected in a sodium heparin syringe and sent to the blood gas laboratory. Na +, K +, and Cl - were measured in the central laboratory with the use of a direct ion-selective electrode technique. Albumin was measured with a bromocresol dye colorimetric technique, Mg 2+ by a formazan dye derivative colorimetric technique, phosphate by a phosphomolybdate complex colorimetric technique, and Ca 2+ by an Arsenazo III dye colorimetric technique. Partial arterial CO 2 tension and lactate were measured and base excess was calculated on the Radiometer-ABL 725 analyzer in the blood gas laboratory.

Quantitative acid–base calculations

Quantitative acid–base analysis was performed as described by Stewart and later modified by Figge and colleagues to account for the effects of plasma proteins. The essence of this approach revolves around the concept that there are only three independent variables of acid–base status: partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO 2), strong ion difference (SID), and the total amount of weak acids and proteins in plasma, mainly comprising albumin and phosphates. The SID is the net charge balance of all strong ions present, where a 'strong ion' is one that is completely (or almost completely) dissociated. This is also described as the apparent SID, SID a, and can be represented by the following equation (all concentrations in mEq/l):

SID a = (Na + + K + + Ca 2+ + Mg 2+) - (Cl - + lactate -)

### Sodium chloride, sodium citrate (Regiocit) [^fe5c6736]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

REGIOCIT is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment or in circulatory shock with muscle hypoperfusion (see CONTRAINDICATIONS).

Excessive infusion of citrate can lead to acute hypocalcemia and metabolic alkalosis, with neurologic and cardiac complications. Treatment consists of discontinuation of the citrate infusion and infusion of calcium.

Endocrine and Metabolism

Hypocalcemia

REGIOCIT solution contains no calcium, and may lead to systemic ionized hypocalcemia, due to loss of calcium bound to citrate in the effluent and/or in the case of systemic citrate accumulation (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION, Administration).

Electrolyte and Acid–Base Balance

REGIOCIT solution contains citrate, which can influence the patient's electrolyte and acid–base balance. Plasma electrolyte and acid–base parameters should be closely monitored during CRRT. Closely monitor sodium, magnesium, potassium, phosphate, and calcium. Infusion of electrolytes may be needed to supplement any loss.

Hypercalcemia

Medicinal products containing calcium used for maintenance of calcium homeostasis in CRRT patients can increase the risk of hypercalcemia, and can result in a reduced anticoagulation effect. Care should be taken to avoid excessive titration in administering calcium as this can lead to hypercalcemia. Frequent monitoring of pH, electrolytes, total-to-ionized calcium ratio, and systemic ionized calcium is important to avoid electrolyte and/or acid-base imbalance.

### A hydrophobic gel phantom for study of thermochemical ablation: initial results using a weak acid and weak base [^e733b1bf]. Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose

To develop a model for study of exothermic chemical reactions potentially useful for tissue ablation.

Materials and Methods

Seven gelatins ranging from 0.5% to 30% wt/vol with and without 15% or 30% caps and several commercial gels were evaluated. Baseline temperature measurements were taken. Acetic acid and ammonium hydroxide were sequentially injected over periods of 10–15 seconds in 1-mL aliquots, forming a discrete aqueous reaction chamber. Congo red pH indicator was included to assess the reaction. A thermocouple allowed data collection at completion of injection and every 15 seconds for 5 minutes. Injections were performed in triplicate, and average temperatures for each time point were reported.

Results

Gelatins fractured or refluxed even at the lowest concentrations tested. Most commercial gels proved too viscous and likewise led to reflux along the needle tract. A mineral oil-based gel was selected because of its ability to form a chamber without reflux or fracture and its clear colorless character, hydrophobic nature, chemical stability, viscosity, specific gravity, and cost. Temperatures during the first 60 seconds of the neutralization reaction showed an immediate increase that correlated well with concentration.

Conclusions

The oil gel phantom is a safe, useful, readily available, inexpensive model to study mixing behaviors and maximum heating potentials for reactions that may prove useful in thermochemical tissue ablation for oncologic interventions. Measurable temperature changes occurred even at the lowest concentrations, and higher concentrations produced a greater release of heat energy.

### Causes of metabolic acidosis in canine hemorrhagic shock: role of unmeasured ions [^8b4e70d7]. Critical Care (2007). Low credibility.

Outcome prediction based on the quantitative approach remains controversial. Some investigators have found that the pH and the standard base excess are better outcome predictors than the SIG. However, other investigators have found that the SIG is a powerful predictor of outcome in acutely ill or injured patients. In critically ill patients, SIG was a strong independent predictor of mortality when it was the major source of acidosis. Also, in patients with major vascular injury and in children following cardiopulmonary bypass surgery, an elevated SIG appeared to be superior to other conventional mortality predictors.

Growing evidence suggests that extracellular acidosis itself has profound effects on the host, particularly in the area of immune function. It is now becoming apparent that different forms of acidosis and even different types of metabolic acidosis produce different effects, and SIG generation may be one feature.

Fluid resuscitation might have affected the SIG in the present model of hemorrhagic shock, although only hydroxyethyl starch solutions were given. The colloid molecule itself may be a weak acid. Albumin and gelatin preparations contain a weak acid activity. Gelatins have been shown to increase both AG and SIG, most likely due to their negative charge and relatively long circulating half-life.

There are several limitations in this study. First, we were not able to find a strict correlation between SIG and the serum concentrations of citrate and/or acetate. This is not entirely unexpected since the generation of the SIG is most probably multifactorial. Second, we have used capillary electrophoresis for identification of potential candidates, and concentrations of still-unknown metabolites may be below the level of detection of this method. Third, using Stewart's approach to acid-base balance has some limitations. A major criticism is a possible inaccuracy of determinations of plasma electrolyte concentrations. Such inaccuracy means that the calculation of the SID a, AG, and SIG can be erroneous. If, as in our study, mean values of larger collectives are used, always with utilization of the same measurement techniques for determinations of electrolytes, these limitations should be insignificant.

5.1 Electrolyte and Volume Abnormalities

PHOXILLUM and PRISMASOL solutions can affect electrolytes and volume and may result in hyperkalemia or hyperphosphatemia. Monitor hemodynamic status and fluid inputs and outputs, potassium, phosphorous, calcium, other electrolytes and acid-base balance throughout the procedure. Abnormalities may be corrected by changing the formulation of replacement solution and/or dialysate, supplementation, or adjusting flow rates appropriately [see Dosage and Administration (2)].

PHOXILLUM replacement solutions contain hydrogen phosphate, a weak acid that may increase the risk of metabolic acidosis.

5.2 Blood Glucose Abnormalities

The use of PRISMASOL and PHOXILLUM replacement solutions can affect blood glucose levels resulting in hypo- or hyper-glycemia depending upon the dextrose content of the replacement solution. Monitor blood glucose levels regularly. Patients may require initiation of or modification of antidiabetic therapy or other corrective measures during treatment.

Combined pH and impedance monitoring — preferred characterization tool: Combined esophageal pH-impedance monitoring is considered the best tool to characterize gastroesophageal reflux because it can detect all types of reflux events (acidic, weakly acidic, weakly alkaline) and determine the proximal extent of the refluxate within the esophagus.

Background

Reflectance near-infrared spectroscopy (600–2200 nm) can noninvasively probe deep into tissues. Blood is the predominant absorber of near-infrared light in biological tissues. We investigated the feasibility of using reflectance near-infrared spectroscopy to measure blood pH in vitro.

Methods

Reflectance near-infrared spectra (600–2200 nm) were obtained with a fiberoptic probe immersed in diluted human packed red blood cells maintained at 37 degrees C. Changes in pH (6.800–7.600) were induced by: (1) varying the partial pressure of carbon dioxide by the bubbling of mixtures of humidified carbon dioxide and nitrogen gas through the blood; and (2) adding 1 N HCl/NaOH. Humidified oxygen gas was bubbled through the blood to generate variations in oxygen saturation. After each titration of pH, the spectrum was recorded and blood was sampled for the measurement of: pH, pCO(2), and pO(2) using blood gas analysis; and hemoglobin concentration and oxygen saturation using co-oximetry. Samples from three separate pH titrations were combined (120 total samples) and analyzed using partial least-squares analysis to generate a mathematical model relating spectral changes to pH (calibration set). This model was then used to predict the pH of a set of 36 pH titrations (prediction set).

Results

Quantitative and qualitiative analyses of the spectra in the calibration set found that spectral changes in the wavelength range, 650–1050 nm, were directly related to changes in pH. First-derivative-treated spectra from the calibration set, analyzed using partial least-squares analysis, generated a mathematical model with a cross-validated r(2) of 0.939 and a standard error of calibration of 0.046 pH unit. When this model was applied to the prediction set, with an offset correction, the r(2) was 0.936 with a standard error of prediction of 0.050 pH unit.

Conclusion

Blood pH can be predicted in vitro with clinical significance using reflectance near-infrared spectroscopy (650–1050 nm) within a standard error of 0.050 pH unit.
