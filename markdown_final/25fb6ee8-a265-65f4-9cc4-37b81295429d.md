## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which option correctly captures Kant's categorical imperative. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core formulation of the categorical imperative. Then, I should verify how each answer choice maps to that formulation. Next, I will check for common misinterpretations, especially the "means versus ends" language. Finally, I will confirm the best match and briefly justify why the others fail.

> Let me first confirm the canonical statement. Kant's categorical imperative, in its most cited formulation, is "Act only according to that maxim whereby you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law", which is a test of universalizability of the maxim behind an action, not a directive about community interests or a prohibition on harm per se [^152b881c].

> Now, I will examine Option A, "You must not consciously harm another person". Wait, let me verify whether this aligns with universalizability. While Kantian ethics would generally condemn harming others, this option frames morality as a negative prohibition rather than the universal-law test, so it does not capture the formal structure of the categorical imperative itself, even if it may be morally consonant with it in many cases [^notfound].

> Next, Option B, "You must always act in the best interests of the community". Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; this sounds more like a utilitarian or communitarian principle than Kant's deontological, duty-based universalizability test. Kant's imperative is about acting on maxims you could will to be universal laws, not about maximizing communal welfare, so this misstates the core concept [^notfound].

> Option C, "You must treat human beings as means rather than ends". Hmm, wait a minute, that's backwards. Kant's second formulation famously instructs us to treat humanity, whether in ourselves or others, always as an end and never merely as a means, so this option inverts the correct principle and is definitively incorrect [^notfound].

> Option D, "You must act according as if your values apply to everyone". Let me think about this carefully. This phrasing parallels the universalizability requirement: the maxim you act on should be one you could consistently will that everyone adopt, which is precisely the spirit of "act only according to that maxim whereby you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law", so this is the closest match among the choices provided [^152b881c].

> Final answer: D. You must act according as if your values apply to everyone [^152b881c].

---

The categorical imperative is Kant's foundational moral principle: **act only on maxims you could will to be universal laws** [^152b881c]. This means your actions should be guided by rules you'd accept for everyone, everywhere, always — a test of universalizability [^fc0d3e3c]. Option D best captures this, while A and B are too narrow and C reverses Kant's actual teaching to treat people as ends, not merely as means [^notfound].

## Formulations of the categorical imperative

Kant expressed the categorical imperative in several ways; the most influential are the **universal law formulation** and the **humanity formulation**.

- **Universal law formulation**: "Act only according to that maxim whereby you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law" [^152b881c].
- **Humanity formulation**: "Act in such a way that you treat humanity, whether in your own person or in the person of another, always at the same time as an end, never merely as a means" [^notfound].

## Analysis of answer choices

| **Option** | **Statement** | **Analysis** |
|-|-|-|
| A | You must not consciously harm another person. | Too narrow; Kant's ethics is not just about avoiding harm but about acting on universalizable principles [^fc0d3e3c]. |
| B | You must always act in the best interests of the community. | Misleading; Kant emphasizes duty and universalizability, not consequentialist community benefit [^fc0d3e3c]. |
| C | You must treat human beings as means rather than ends. | Incorrect; Kant explicitly says to treat humanity as an end, never merely as a means [^notfound]. |
| D | You must act according as if your values apply to everyone. | Correct; this aligns with the universal law formulation and the principle of universalizability [^152b881c]. |

---

## Conclusion

The correct answer is **D**. The categorical imperative requires acting only on maxims you could will to be universal laws, reflecting universalizability and respect for persons as ends in themselves [^152b881c].

GRADE strength of recommendation classifications — For 1 — Strong recommendation for or against, criteria are that desirable consequences CLEARLY OUTWEIGH the undesirable consequences in most settings (or vice versa); most individuals in this situation would want the recommended course of action, and only a small proportion would not; most individuals should follow the recommended course of action and formal decision aids are not likely to be needed to help individual patients make decisions consistent with their values and preferences; and the recommendation can be adopted as policy in most situations with adherence usable as a quality criterion or performance indicator. For 2 — Conditional recommendation for or against, criteria are that desirable consequences PROBABLY OUTWEIGH undesirable consequences in most settings (or vice versa); the majority of individuals would want the suggested course of action but many would not and decision aids may be useful in helping patients make decisions consistent with their individual risks, values and preferences; clinicians should recognize that different choices will be appropriate for each individual and must help each individual arrive at a management decision consistent with the individual's values and preferences; and policymaking will require substantial debate and involvement of various stakeholders with performance measures assessing whether decision-making is appropriate.

### Professional recommendations: disclosing facts and values [^b676eafb]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2001). Low credibility.

It is not unusual for patients and their families, when confronted with difficult medical choices, to ask their physicians for advice. This paper outlines the shades of meaning of two questions frequently put to physicians: "What should I do?" and "What would you do?" It is argued that these are not questions about objective matters of fact. Hence, any response to such questions requires an understanding, appreciation, and disclosure of the personal context and values that inform the recommendation. A framework for considering and articulating a response to these questions is suggested, using as a heuristic the phrasing "If I were you… /If it were me…"

### The ethical canary: narrow reflective equilibrium as a source of moral justification in healthcare priority-setting [^7c045b56]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2024). Medium credibility.

One such scheme, recently developed as a tool for articulating normative reasoning in healthcare priority-setting, classifies normative content according to four types, based on degree of specification (see figure 1). Values, the least specified normative type, describe abstract ends such as justice, liberty, dignity and happiness that a priority-setter believes are worth pursuing because they are 'good' or 'right'. Principles are more specified action-guiding claims that serve as a pledge to act in a certain way or as the basis for part of a chain of reasoning. Standards are specific ways of doing things that are accepted by authority, precedent, custom or general consent. And case-based judgements are considered conclusions reached through the evaluation of information relevant to a specific context or case. Together, these four types of normative commitment give rise to a chain of reasoning from which is derived a priority-setting decision.

Figure 1
A framework for the articulation of normative reasoning in health technology assessment.

This scheme allows coherence to be systematically evaluated by facilitating the classification of normative content, allowing the degree of alignment within and between each class to be assessed. Say, for example, that a priority-setter has promised to act in accordance with justice. 5 In practice, the value of justice must be specified if it is to act as a guide to action, and this specification can take many different forms. Our hypothetical priority-setter specifies justice through two substantive principles: a principle of fairness, which stipulates that similar cases should be treated similarly, and a principle of efficiency, which requires it to recommend new interventions only if their adoption is likely to lead to a net increase in population health. These principles are operationalised through many detailed standards describing, for example, what procedures will be followed in reaching a decision, what characteristics of a case should be taken into account, how an intervention's contribution to population health will be assessed and on what basis it will be deemed cost-effective. Ultimately, this policy — which can be shown to be coherent — is applied to an individual case, which generates a collection of further judgements that contribute to a decision about whether or not the intervention should be adopted.

### Systematic review to support the development of nutrient reference intake values: challenges and solutions [^2514e2d8]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2010). Low credibility.

Workshops sponsored by the Institute of Medicine (IOM) and the World Health Organization suggested that incorporating systematic (evidence) reviews into the process of updating nutrient reference values would provide a comprehensive and distilled evidence document to decision makers and enhance the transparency of the decision-making process the IOM used in recommending the Dietary Reference Intake values (DRIs) for US and Canadian populations. At the request of the US and Canadian government sponsors of the ongoing review of the 1997 vitamin D and calcium DRI values, the Tufts Evidence-based Practice Center performed a systematic review for the current DRI Committee to use early in its deliberations. We described the approach used to include systematic review into the IOM process for updating nutrient reference values and highlighted major challenges encountered along with the solutions used. The challenges stemmed from the need to review and synthesize a large number of primary studies covering a broad range of outcomes. We resolved these challenges by 1) working with a technical expert panel to prioritize and select outcomes of interest, 2) developing methods to use existing systematic reviews and documenting the limitations by doing so, 3) translating results from studies not designed to address issues of interest by using a transparent process, and 4) establishing tailored quality-assessment tools to assist in decision making. The experiences described in this article can serve as a basis for future improvements in systematic reviews of nutrients and to better integrate systematic review into development of future nutrient reference values.

Values clarification methods and responding to patient questions — definition and application: Values clarification methods are defined as "methods to help patients think about the desirability of options or attributes of options within a specific decision context, in order to identify which option [they] prefer," may involve identifying management options, identifying aspects of options that are most important, and making comparisons between options, and when patients ask clinicians "What would you do?" the question can be used to elicit a patient's values without necessarily disclosing personal opinions; facilitating a values-based decision will lead to improved decision satisfaction and improved long-term outcomes, including coping and grief resolution.

### The values and rules of capacity assessments [^9f73578c]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2022). Medium credibility.

This article advances two views on the role of evaluative judgment in clinical assessments of decision-making capacity. The first is that it is rationally impossible for such assessments to exclude judgments of the values a patient uses to motivate their decision-making. Predictably, and second, attempting to exclude such judgments sometimes yields outcomes that contain intractable dilemmas that harm patients. These arguments count against the prevailing model of assessment in common law countries-the four abilities model-which is often incorrectly advertised as being value-neutral in respect of patient decision-making both by its proponents and in statute. A straightforward evaluative model of capacity assessment which wears its values on its sleeves and is biased against what are called 'serious prudential mistakes' avoids these rational and practical problems.

### Ethical issues in radiation oncology during a pandemic [^152b881c]. Advances in Radiation Oncology (2020). Medium credibility.

How Should Decisions Be Made?

Decisions related to these issues are often subjective, and to the extent possible they should not be made ad hoc. Rather, one should strive to have institutional (eg, cancer hospital-based) and/or departmental policies that can be applied to most situations. However, all clinical scenarios cannot be predicted and analyzed ahead of time, so there needs to be flexibility. In addition, there will be substantial gray areas regarding patient-specific decisions.

If possible, for ambiguous situations in which standard policies may not be appropriate, it is advisable to obtain advice from other individuals in the department or the hospital. There is a risk that a physician may try to do something "special" for his/her patient, and this may not be in the overall societal, or the patient's, best interest.

In a pandemic we may need to switch from an emphasis on the respect for patient's autonomy (the first of the principles elucidated by Beauchamp and Childress) to an emphasis on social justice (the fourth principle). But, it is critically important that we follow Kant's advice to respect the patient's autonomy. The patient needs to know what is being done and for what reasons. If we are deviating from long-standing norms, this needs to be fully discussed with the patient so that the patient is fully informed. Kant emphasized the importance of the categorical imperative, "Act only according to the maxim whereby you can, at the same time, will that it should become a universal law." This "golden rule" should still hold sway.

### Framework for evaluation research on clinical ethical case interventions: the role of ethics consultants [^50a2875c]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2022). Medium credibility.

This does not imply that there are no conflicting values in ethics. First, the criterion of explicit normativity refers to the definition of ethics as 'considering all relevant interests' compared with value perspectives that do not. And again, as with the first difference, the continuum is gradual. While in medical interventions different functional perspectives can be — and often are implicitly — weighed against each other, ECC mark the other end of a continuum between a singular functional perspective and the explicit consideration of a more universal perspective. Second, this does, however, not mean that there are no considerable differences about the idea of a non-partisan standard itself. Especially in pluralistic societies, a variety of different concepts of ethics can been set into place. This reflects the considerable differences which exist regarding the question what ethics is actually about, what its basic principles are (if there are any) or what its procedures of deliberation might be, suggesting, of course, different approaches to consider what ought to be done.

### National consensus project clinical practice guidelines for quality palliative care guidelines, 4th edition [^3cb56dff]. Journal of Palliative Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Domain 8: Ethical and legal aspects of care — Guideline 8.4 treatment and ongoing decision-making states that, within the limits of applicable laws and standards, person-centered goals form the basis for the plan of care and decisions related to providing, forgoing, and discontinuing treatments. The patient's plan of care reflects ethical principles and the assessment of treatment preferences and is accurately documented to reflect the patient's previously stated goals in terms of providing, forgoing, and discontinuing care. The IDT ensures that existing treatments align with the patient's goals and the standard practices of care, and the team actively works to prevent medically non-beneficial care. When a family member or surrogate decision-maker seeks to override the patient's documented treatment decisions, the patient's preferences are reviewed, and ethics consultation is sought if needed, and failure to honor patient preferences is considered an ethical concern and is addressed by the IDT. Children receive open and honest, developmentally appropriate information about their serious illness and treatment options and are given the opportunity to participate in decision-making according to their wishes, age, and developmental capacity, and when the child's wishes differ from those of the adult decision-maker, staff is available to assist the child and family work towards a resolution, prioritizing fidelity to the patient. When parents or legal decision-makers express a strong preference for non-disclosure of a poor prognosis to a seriously ill child or adolescent, the IDT assesses family motivations and values regarding truth-telling practices and preferences; while it is sometimes ethically permissible to defer to family values regarding nondisclosure of prognosis, clinicians work collaboratively with the family to meet the child or adolescent's individual needs while respecting the parent or decision-makers' expectations and boundaries. All treatments provided are directed at the relief of suffering, in accordance with the doctrine of double effect, and the IDT educates the patient and family regarding the cost of care and financial burdens associated with treatment options. In cases where the wishes of the patient or surrogate conflict with the clinicians caring for the patient, processes are in place to honor clinician conscientious objection in a manner that ensures patients are never abandoned and continue to receive quality, safe care, and when treatments are forgone or discontinued, the IDT ensures appropriate symptom control at all times, as aligned with the ethical principle of nonmaleficence.

### Justification of principles for healthcare priority setting: the relevance and roles of empirical studies exploring public values [^d8f403a8]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2025). Medium credibility.

The notion of reflective equilibrium

Reflective equilibrium is primarily a theory about what makes moral judgements epistemically justified; however, it is often related to as a method for moral reasoning. 3 Moreover, it is sometimes used to denote the goal or endpoint of such a process, namely where moral judgements cohere (and then, supposedly, are justified). Since it is doubtful that one ever reaches such an ideal state, as also acknowledged by Rawls, it is more appropriate to think about the goal of the process of moral reasoning as arriving at 'resting points' rather than 'end-points'. In the following, we shall primarily relate to reflective equilibrium as a theory about epistemic justification of the moral judgements in a given resting point. That being said, any such theory will be closely related to the method of moral reasoning according to which one arrives at that resting point.

The process of reflective equilibrium is a working back and forth between: (a) one's considered moral judgements about particular cases, and (b) ethical principles. In the following, we shall illustrate the process by dividing it into four separate steps. We primarily structure the process in these separate steps for clarificatory reasons, in practice the steps will often interplay.

Identifying and filtering judgements — first step

The first step may be described in the words of Tersman: it '… begins with filtering one's moral views so that one is left only with those qualifying as considered judgements… ' (p. 47). 4 For a judgement to qualify as a considered, rather than a raw unreflected moral judgement, it should meet a number of requirements. It should be of the kind in which one has strong faith, that one has the relevant information about and it should not be best explained by one's self-interest or prejudices (more on such filtering below).

Formulating principles — second step

The second step is to formulate ethical principles that can account for the considered judgements. These principles may vary in their degree of specificity, they may be of the general kind such as 'euthanasia is wrong' or more specified such as 'euthanasia is wrong when offered to patients who are not terminally ill'. Note that the considered moral judgements may also vary in their degree of specificity. Accordingly, there is no clear-cut line between what qualifies as a considered moral judgement and what qualifies as an ethical principle.

### The ethical canary: narrow reflective equilibrium as a source of moral justification in healthcare priority-setting [^872b6345]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2024). Medium credibility.

The problem with substantive principles

Any decision, by definition, has content, and if a decision is to be non-arbitrary then that content must reflect substantive reasons. One approach to moral evaluation is to consider whether these reasons are morally justified. According to this rationale, if a priority-setter has made its decision for 'good' reasons, then it follows that the decision itself is 'good'.

But what constitutes a good reason? One approach is to ground claims on substantive principles of justice. One might, for example, employ the utilitarian principle of health maximisation to argue that allocation decisions should be based on whether an intervention's use will increase or decrease overall population health, once opportunity cost has been taken into account. 1 Or one might take the prioritarian view that preference should be given to the worse-off in society, even if this is somewhat inefficient. Different principles generate different conclusions and, in the absence of an agreed theory of justice, there is no way to independently adjudicate between them: the utilitarian would simply argue that the prioritarian is mistaken in their moral beliefs and vice versa. Even under pluralist theories that incorporate a range of different principles, the question of how these should be selected, specified and balanced remains thorny. Thus, any priority-setter who seeks to justify their decisions on purely substantive grounds will likely find those grounds rejected by a proportion of society, undermining their legitimacy at least in the eyes of those who take an alternative view of what justice requires.

An alternative approach is to explicitly ground substantive principles for priority-setting on public views, for example, by conducting studies exploring societal values. Doing so might enhance a priority-setter's perceived legitimacy and make its decisions less vulnerable to challenge. But the mere fact that a view is widely held does not guarantee that it is ethically permissible — a racist society may support a racially based allocation, but this would not make it morally justified. Moreover, recourse to public opinion offers no remedy for matters on which there is no public consensus. Reasonable disagreement has been demonstrated across a range of moral questions relevant to healthcare priority-setting and is the inevitable product of ethical deliberation in any free-thinking pluralist society. The problems associated with basing moral evaluation on individual substantive principles, therefore, remain unresolved.

### National consensus project clinical practice guidelines for quality palliative care guidelines, 4th edition [^5e283ae7]. Journal of Palliative Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Guideline 8.3 Screening and Assessment — patient preferences and goals for medical care are elicited using core ethical principles and documented — sets criteria stating that clinicians discuss achievable goals of care in the context of patient values and preferences; advance care planning education is provided to the patient and family, including completion of advance directives such as designation of a surrogate health care decision-maker (except for minors), living wills, and inpatient and out-of-hospital do-not-resuscitate orders and other portable medical orders; patient-expressed values, care preferences, spiritual beliefs, and cultural influences are elicited, routinely reviewed, and documented with attention to changes in health care status or transitions of care; the IDT revisits and updates decisions when clinical status changes and documents changes in the medical record, especially prior to care transitions; to ensure availability of advance care planning documents, the IDT uses electronic medical records or advance directive registries whenever possible, and clinicians ensure that the treatment plan is concordant with the patient's evolving goals across settings; patients with disabilities are assumed to have decision-making capacity unless determined otherwise according to applicable laws; when caring for pediatric patients with serious illness, the child or adolescents' views and preferences, including assent for treatment when developmentally appropriate, are assessed, documented, and given appropriate weight in decision-making; for patients who are not developmentally able or have cognitive and/or communication impairment or incapacity and have not previously expressed values, preferences, or beliefs, IDT members follow state laws to identify a default decision-maker; and clinicians consider aspects of patient care that may burden or have ill effects on family members, with the IDT responsible for identifying these difficulties when possible within its scope of practice and assisting in identifying resources to meet these needs.

### Can one do good medical ethics without principles? [^155c7b13]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2015). Low credibility.

The criteria for determining what it is to do good medical ethics are the quality of ethical analysis and ethical justifications for decisions and actions. Justifications for decisions and actions rely on ethical principles, be they the 'famous four' or subsidiary ethical principles relevant to specific contexts. Examples from clinical ethics, research ethics and public health ethics reveal that even when not stated explicitly, principles are involved in ethical justifications. Principles may come into conflict, however, and the resolution of an ethical dilemma requires providing good reasons for preferring one principle over another.

### A user guide to the American Society of Hematology clinical practice guidelines [^c30c2183]. Blood Advances (2020). High credibility.

Determinants of recommendation strength — certainty, patient values, cost, and examples emphasize that "The second determinant of the strength of a recommendation is the certainty in the effect estimates." In acutely ill medical patients, "For instance, thromboprophylaxis with LMWH has an apparent benefit in reducing symptomatic PE, symptomatic DVT, major bleeding, and heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, compared with UFH, in acutely ill medical patients," yet "The 5 randomized trials from which the evidence came were, however, judged at serious risk of bias due to an unclear randomization sequence-generation process and absence of blinding, and provided imprecise estimates," and "the body of evidence was rated down as low certainty," so "In this scenario, use of LMWH over UFH warrants a conditional recommendation." With respect to values, "The third determinant of the strength of a recommendation is uncertainty about, or variability in, the relative importance patients assign to the outcomes," such that "If significant variability in patients' values is known or assumed, it is expected that patients' preferences for 1 treatment option over another will also vary; hence a strong recommendation would be inappropriate." Regarding resources, "Cost is another determinant of the strength of a recommendation," and "ASH guidelines are generally focused on well-resourced settings; however, efforts to adapt guidelines to lower-resource settings are pursued when these considerations become more context dependent." An applied conditional example is "a conditional recommendation for a longer (6–12 week) international normalized ratio (INR) recall interval over a shorter (4-week) INR recall interval, during periods of stable INR control, for patients taking a vitamin K antagonist."

### The moral primacy of the human being [^b9463621]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2010). Low credibility.

Can the view that medical science is more important than the individual properly persuade recruitment to trials? This paper considers the nature and interests of the person and their relationships to the concepts of science and society; and analyses a conception of value used to balance the interests of science and research subjects. The implications of arguments opposing the primacy of the individual are set out to indicate their implausibility; while the primacy principle is described to show its necessity in any moral society. Finally, the importance of fully informed consent to participate is explained with the requirement that the individual human life provide the criteria of moral value for human life.

### When four principles are too many: a commentary [^64335d6a]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2012). Low credibility.

This commentary briefly argues that the four prima facie principles of beneficence, non-maleficence, respect for autonomy and justice enable a clinician (and anybody else) to make ethical sense of the author's proposed reliance on professional guidance and rules, on law, on professional integrity and on best interests, and to subject them all to ethical analysis and criticism based on widely acceptable basic prima facie moral obligations; and also to confront new situations in the light of those acceptable principles.

### Evaluation, treatment, and prevention of vitamin D deficiency: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^4a2fc217]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). Medium credibility.

Regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for vitamins, minerals, and dietary supplements, more specifically with respect to vitamin D and calcium (prevention of CVD), ES 2011 guidelines recommend to do not prescribe vitamin D supplementation beyond recommended daily needs for the purpose of preventing CVD or death or improving QoL.

### Where the ethical action is [^e0fcff95]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2021). Medium credibility.

It is common to think of medical and ethical modes of thought as different in kind. In such terms, some clinical situations are made more complicated by an additional ethical component. Against this picture, we propose that medical and ethical modes of thought are not different in kind, but merely different aspects of what it means to be human. We further propose that clinicians are uniquely positioned to synthesise these two aspects without prior knowledge of philosophical ethics.

### Expert panel on integrated guidelines for cardiovascular health and risk reduction in children and adolescents: summary report [^2044d80a]. PES (2012). Medium credibility.

Evidence grading system — guideline definitions for evidence-based statements define four statement types with clinician implications. For a strong recommendation, The Expert Panel believes that the benefits of the recommended approach clearly exceed the harms and that the quality of the supporting evidence is excellent (Grade A or B). In some clearly defined circumstances, strong recommendations may be made on the basis of lesser evidence (Grade C or D) when high-quality evidence is impossible to obtain and when the anticipated benefits clearly outweigh the harms. Clinicians should follow a strong recommendation unless a clear and compelling rationale for an alternative approach is present. For a recommendation, The Expert Panel believes that the benefits exceed the harms but that the quality of the evidence is not as strong (Grade B or C). In some clearly defined circumstances, recommendations may be made on the basis of lesser evidence (Grade D) when high-quality evidence is impossible to obtain and when the anticipated benefits clearly outweigh the harms. Clinicians should generally follow a recommendation but remain alert to new information and sensitive to patient preferences. For optional statements, Either the quality of the evidence that exists is suspect (Grade D) or well-performed studies (Grade A, B, or C) show little clear advantage to one approach versus another, and Clinicians should be flexible in their decision-making regarding appropriate practice, although they may set boundaries on alternatives; patient and family preference should have a substantial influencing role. For no recommendation, There is both a lack of pertinent evidence (Grade D) and an unclear balance between benefits and harms, and Clinicians should not be constrained in their decision-making and should be alert to newly published evidence that clarifies the balance of benefit versus harm; patient and family preferences should have a substantial influencing role.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2014). Medium credibility.

Key economic concepts — efficiency, cost-benefit, and cost-effectiveness introduce efficiency as a core concept and state that economists accept the policy objective "to maximize the well-being (sometimes referred to as utility) of the members of society collectively."

### The ethical canary: narrow reflective equilibrium as a source of moral justification in healthcare priority-setting [^6526af5e]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2024). Medium credibility.

Priority-setters also plausibly have moral obligations that are independent of legitimacy, particularly when tasked with upholding population health. Health is central to well-being, the pursuit or protection of which holds primary moral importance in many ethical theories. Health is also critically important for ensuring fair equality of opportunity, providing a prima facie reason for priority-setters to avoid acting in ways that are to its detriment. Allocating resources based on arbitrary or unjustified reasons may breach a priority-setter's institutional duty to act for the public good and, in some cases, would contravene morally grounded standards of public life for those working on a priority-setter's behalf.

Finding a normative basis from which to morally defend priority-setting decisions is, however, difficult. Individuals have different views on how resources should be allocated and any attempt to justify decisions with reference to substantive principles is, therefore, open to challenge by those who consider different principles to be more appropriate. In the absence of any single agreed theory of justice, such instances of reasonable disagreement cannot be reliably adjudicated, weakening claims to moral legitimacy. Many priority-setters have, therefore, opted to focus on procedure, reasoning that while individuals may differ in what they perceive to be just grounds for decision-making, we can all agree on what constitutes a just process. But it is questionable whether a just process by itself is sufficient to ensure a just outcome and experience has shown that even procedurally based approaches are liable to raise substantive moral questions. Thus, despite such efforts, evidence suggests that priority-setters are 'falling short' when it comes to demonstrating the legitimacy of their decisions.

### Ethical considerations: care of the critically ill and injured during pandemics and disasters: CHEST consensus statement [^594af9f9]. Chest (2014). Medium credibility.

CHEST consensus statement — use of exclusion criteria for critical care: We suggest it may be ethically permissible to use exclusion criteria for critical care resources, since the advantages of objectivity, equity, and transparency generally outweigh potential disadvantages. Exclusion criteria that are developed prospectively by a multidisciplinary group of experts, in alignment with community values, are more likely to be objective, transparent, and equitably applied. Nevertheless, prospectively defined criteria applied equitably appear a more ethically acceptable decision-making approach than clinical judgment alone, despite potential disadvantages.

### National consensus project clinical practice guidelines for quality palliative care guidelines, 4th edition [^a1dbf167]. Journal of Palliative Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Palliative care glossary — spiritual history, spiritual screening, substituted judgement, and total pain — defines key assessment and ethical concepts as follows: Spiritual history uses a broader set of questions to capture salient information about needs, hopes, and resources, permits the clinician to understand how spiritual concerns could either complement or complicate the patient's overall care, and allows the clinician to incorporate spiritual care into the patient's overall care plan; unlike spiritual screening, which requires only brief training, those doing a spiritual history should have some education and comfort with issues and knowledge of how to engage patients. Spiritual screening or triage is a quick determination of whether a person is experiencing a serious spiritual crisis and therefore needs an immediate referral to a board-certified chaplain, helps identify which patients may benefit from an in-depth spiritual assessment, and good models use a few simple questions that can be asked in the course of an overall patient and family screening, with examples including, "Are spirituality or religion important in your life?" and "How well are those resources working for you at this time?" Substituted judgement refers to the ethical duty of guardians and surrogate decision-makers to make an effort to understand the patient's beliefs and values prior to making decisions on the patient's behalf. Total pain is described as a holistic experience that extends beyond the physiological domain, recognizes the holistic nature of pain and the interplay of psychological and social well-being, spirituality, and culture, and notes that symptoms rarely occur in isolation; rather, they cluster with other symptoms and are influenced by the psychological, social, and cultural characteristics of the individual.

Considerations for treatment implementation — shared decision making defines shared decision making as when a "health care provider and patient work together to make a health care decision based on what is best for the patient" and presents the AHRQ SHARE steps: "STEP 1: Seek your patient's participation. STEP 2: Help your patient explore and compare treatment options. STEP 3: Assess your patient's values and preferences. STEP 4: Reach a decision with your patient. STEP 5: Evaluate your patient's decision." The panel encourages clinicians to refer to the AHRQ's (2016) SHARE approach and states, "There needs to be adequate time to allow shared decision making to occur between the provider and patient while respecting the patient's autonomy in treatment choice" and that "Shared decision making needs to be communicated to the patient in an understandable form." The panel "strongly supports reimbursement of services that improve functioning in individuals with chronic musculoskeletal pain."

### Priority setting and personal health responsibility: an analysis of Norwegian key policy documents [^43615133]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2022). Medium credibility.

The moral subject and object of health responsibility

Central to an analysis of health responsibility is the question of who is responsible (moral subject) for what (moral object). At the individual level, it is commonly thought that only individuals possessing the capacity to evaluate reasons for acting are suited to responsibility ascriptions. At the collective level, society can be the subject of moral health responsibility in the form of being attributed an obligation to provide access to healthcare for its citizensand to promote population health through preventive medicine, research and environmental policies. The objects of responsibility are multiple and can refer to actions, omissions or consequences.

The level of conceptual abstraction

The level of conceptual abstraction distinguishes between understandings of personal health responsibility as a principle or criterion. While principles are broad statements of objectives, such as general directives of what to do, criteria specify conditions that need to be met to adhere to a principle and are used as standards for evaluation and judgement.

The dimension of conceptual abstraction allows differentiating between general and specific attributions of personal responsibility for health. For example, appeals to personal responsibility for health could be seen as moral or spiritual duties to oneself and to society to maintain physical and mental well-being. In this case, personal responsibility is an idealised principle that does not imply specific rationing decisions. In other cases, however, the person's responsibility for past or future behaviour could be applied as a criterion for the assessment of eligibility to services. This can result in exclusion from certain types of treatment, higher copayments or lower priority in access to healthcare.

### How should morality play a role in global health? [^fc0d3e3c]. BMJ Global Health (2025). High credibility.

Immanuel Kant, one of the most influential philosophers, laid the foundation for defining morality. Kant argued that morality is rooted in the concept of duty, guided by reason, and governed by the categorical imperative, a universal principle that requires individuals to act in ways that could become a universal law. According to Kant, morality transcends subjective preferences and emotions, relying instead on rationality to determine the ethical correctness of actions.

The theme of our commentary is to reassert the centrality of morality in global health, which is often dominated by technocratic approaches, social media and distrust.

This paper highlights a feature common to many ethical guidelines — namely, the idea that the interests of the individual shall always prevail over the interests of science and society. The paper presents how some major ethical guidelines treat the balancing of research interests against those of research subjects and spells out the difficulties in interpreting the principle of the primacy of the individual in a way that can be action-guiding. It suggests various alternative interpretations of the primacy of the individual and argues that they do not hold. Finally, the implications of this analysis for ethical guidelines are discussed.

### The impossible interviews-sherlock holmes interviews David sackett:' how much can we trust the guidelines?' [^9f5d90db]. European Heart Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Guidelines and evidence-based medicine, facts, and myths

SH: I did expect your considerations. So I documented myself in every way and, theoretically, you are right but, allow me to ask you whether you are referring to facts or myths. For example, I notice that, if we consider as a whole the major cardiovascular guidelines published between 1984 and 2008 (53 official documents, totalling 7196 recommendations), only 11% of the recommendations had level evidence A (i.e. were generated by prospective randomized clinical trials) while 48% had a level C of evidence (i.e. based on non-unanimous expert opinion). If I am not mistaken, this means that almost 50% of the recommendations relied simply on expert opinion. Not very different from the past, or so it seems! Moreover, after the initial phase of enthusiastic welcome of new guidelines, criticisms often tend to emerge:

Clinical trials do not come into being spontaneously or by some divine will — in most cases, they are the fruit of a convergence of interest between a leading research group and pharmaceutical or biomedical companies. Often, the companies nominate (and pay) the so-called 'leaders', and this could bias the 'objectivity' of the research.
Hence, behind the guidelines there are economic incentives. The risk is that, by accepting such incentives, non-impartial users could act to cut healthcare costs at the expense of treatment.
There is another risk — that the choice of guidelines' authors may not be on scientific merit or appropriateness, but based on political criteria, e.g. selected by scientific societies for reasons of geographical representativeness or political expediency.

DS: I see you have done some investigation but, in my opinion, the points you make are merely details! Your 'accusations' reveal your bias and hostility towards official institutions. The fact is that the guidelines of the major national and international scientific societies provide a periodical update and summary of the available literature. This makes them an extremely useful clinical tool that it would be difficult, if not impossible, for the single physician to construct. In cardiovascular medicine, both registries and dedicated observational studies have shown a clear benefit in terms of reduced mortality and morbidity following application of the guidelines, particularly regarding the treatment of heart failure, atrial fibrillation and acute coronary syndromes. These are facts!.

### Allergy and immunology practice parameters and guidelines: the new normal [^1a4bf8e2]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2017). Medium credibility.

Revised classification (Table 2) — recommendation rating scale with clinical implications specifies: Strong recommendation means the benefits clearly exceed the harms and the quality of evidence is excellent (Grade A or B); clinicians should follow a strong recommendation unless a clear and compelling rationale for an alternative approach is present. Moderate recommendation means the benefits exceed the harms but the quality of evidence is not as strong (Grade B or C); clinicians also should generally follow a recommendation but should remain alert to new information and sensitive to patient preferences. Weak option means that the quality of evidence that exists is suspect (Grade D) or that well-done studies (Grade A, B, or C) show little clear advantage to one approach vs another; clinicians should be flexible in their decision making with patient preference having a substantial influencing role. No recommendation means there is a lack of pertinent evidence (Grade D) and an unclear balance between benefits and harms; clinicians should feel little constraint in decision making and be alert to new published evidence; patient preference should have a substantial influencing role. Strength categories in this revised schema also include LB (Laboratory based) and NR (Not rated).

### Ethics of incongruity: moral tension generators in clinical medicine [^2e2e3950]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2019). Medium credibility.

Affectively uncomfortable concern, anxiety, indecisionand disputation over 'right' action are among the expressions of moral tension associated with ethical dilemmas. Moral tension is generated and experienced by people. While ethical principles, rules and situations must be worked through in any dilemma, each occurs against a backdrop of people who enact them and stand much to gain or lose depending on how they are applied and resolved. This paper attempts to develop a taxonomy of moral tension based on its intrapersonal and interpersonal sources and expressions. The proposed 'ethics of incongruity' (EoI) outlines ways in which values, actions and needs can find themselves mismatched in morally relevant ways between patients and their clinicians, their own psychologies and their societies. Patient-clinician incongruities may manifest as discord, value misalignment and deception. Patient-patient (ie, intrapersonal) incongruities may manifest as incapacity, akrasia and self-deception. Patient-society incongruities may manifest as disenfranchisement, disaffiliation and disregard. Brief explanations of the incongruities in this scheme are provided, as are suggestions on working within them. Using concepts from moral philosophy when applicable, these suggestions may either ease direct resolution of problems arising from the incongruities, or make sense of the moral tension that arises from the human context of the ethical dilemma at hand. This presentation of content and resolution methods for the EOI is no doubt incomplete. Hopefully, refinement of this preliminary proposal will follow, particularly from clinicians, as the ones who, along with their patients, experience medical ethics in directly tension-inducing ways.

### Knowing-how to care [^a626ad29]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2016). Low credibility.

This paper advances a new moral epistemology and explores some of its normative and practical, especially bioethical, implications. In the first part, it shows that there is moral knowledge and that it is best understood in terms of knowing-how. Thus, moral knowledge cannot be analysed purely in the traditional terms of knowing-that. The fundamental idea is that one knows-how to act morally only if she is capable of following the right normative standards. In the second part, the paper discusses ways of integrating two expressions of moral knowing-how, namely caring and respecting into a coherent normative theory. It builds up the concept of respectful care as the central ingredient of such a normative theory. Finally, it illustrates how respectful care may transform some of our current clinical bioethical practices.

### American Society of Hematology 2023 guidelines for management of venous thromboembolism: thrombophilia testing [^5370d74d]. Blood Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

Some of these recommendations introduce the potential for change in clinical practice and therefore deserve some additional consideration. First, the recommendations are all conditional, based mostly on patient preferences and values attached to relevant outcomes. We do acknowledge that conditional recommendations might be less appealing than strong ones to be applied to most patients and that applying conditional recommendations will require the education of patients and physicians to effectively elicit those preferences and appropriately use them for shared decision making. However, risk stratification is necessary to accomplish individualized optimal treatment, which makes our panel stand behind the present deliberations. Second, some of the recommendations may appear counterintuitive: for example, one may feel that it is inappropriate to test young people with COC-related VTE or patients with VTE provoked by transient nonsurgical risk factors, as their risk is generally considered too low for them to be candidates for lifelong treatment if they have thrombophilia. Against this uneasiness, we invite the reader to consider how reluctant one can be to treat a young patient with unprovoked VTE for life. These patients are not the majority of people enrolled in clinical trials, so we have little direct evidence about the need to treat them for life, yet that is the recommended approach. Furthermore, one would realize that cases of VTE related to COCs or nonsurgical risk factors are relatively few compared with the many more exposed to the same risk factors, and it is likely that a fraction of them might have a relevant provoking cofactor represented by thrombophilia. Others might be worried by the cost associated with testing for thrombophilia; for them, we note that irrespective of whether thrombophilia testing results will be used to start or withhold treatment, the cost of testing is negligible compared with the cost of lifelong anticoagulation (which we considered in our process), likely even after including indirect costs stemming from the treatment of additional events in untreated patients (which we did not consider). Finally, someone might be confused by having "divergent" recommendations for the same condition (thrombosis at unusual sites) depending on the standard of care adopted in a specific setting, whereby testing for thrombophilia is recommended to prolong treatment where the standard of care is short-term treatment duration and not recommended when the standard of care is long-term treatment for everyone. Under the perspective of choosing the best management option for patients with thrombophilia, patients with thrombophilia will indeed receive indefinite treatment because of both recommendations (because of testing in 1 case and regardless of testing in the other). Again, this is the result of a robust, pragmatic, and logical process that assessed the value of testing within the context in which the results of testing will be used.

### Support for diversity and the racial status quo in lay and legal samples [^817eb1a8]. Communications Psychology (2025). Medium credibility.

Moral rationales are grounded in intrinsic values and principles, either casting a commitment to diversity as an inherent value or linking it to underlying values such as justice or fairness. A common moral rationale, for example, argues that diversity is a moral imperative to ensure equal opportunity and treatment. In this case, equal opportunity and treatment represent the underlying values. The distinguishing feature of moral rationales is that diversity is embraced regardless of any self-serving, tangible benefit it may provide to those in positions of power such as majority group members. Instead, moral diversity rationales are embraced because of their alignment with non-contingent, non-transactional values.

Though moral and instrumental diversity rationales are distinct, they are not inherently mutually exclusive and in practice they often co-occur. Conceptually, instrumental and moral diversity rationales can overlap when diversity is pursued out of a sense of collective benefit when a superordinate group or entity explicitly inclusive of both historically included and excluded groups (e.g. "society") stands to benefit from embracing diversity (e.g. embracing diversity ensures a more cohesive, secure, and prosperous society for all; though conceptions of the collective risk being implicitly dominated by majority groups –). This unique case notwithstanding, it is also common for organizations to simultaneously profess an array of both instrumental and moral rationales to at least some degree. For example, a university can pursue diversity because it cultivates a more innovative educational environment while also providing more equitable opportunities for groups that have been historically underrepresented in university settings. Thus, these two rationales in tandem present a broad set of possibilities for why people and organizations might embrace diversity out of some combination of moral obligation and instrumental interest.

### National consensus project clinical practice guidelines for quality palliative care guidelines, 4th edition [^348fb248]. Journal of Palliative Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Domain 8: Ethical and Legal Aspects of Care — IDT ethics infrastructure emphasizes that IDT protocols are developed to ensure patient and family access to ethics resources and support in all care settings. IDT members maintain professional boundaries with clear role expectations while balancing objectivity with caring compassion, and attention is paid to patient and family cultural and spiritual values that impact care preferences and potentially conflict with clinicians' values; the IDT is aware that cultural factors can influence decision-making and autonomy. Guidance is provided to surrogate decision-makers about the legal and ethical basis for surrogate decision-making including honoring the patient's known preferences, substituted judgment, and best-interest criteria, and social justice principles and costs of care are considered in the allocation of resources across all populations to improve the health outcomes of seriously ill people and address healthcare disparities. IDTs without ready access to ethics consultation identify avenues to access consultations and resources (eg, consult with specialty palliative care experts or establish a collaborative relationship with a medical center ethics program), and ensuring IDT sustainability and avoiding clinician burnout is considered an ethical obligation in all care settings to preserve team members' health and ability to remain engaged in palliative care.

### The impossible interviews-sherlock holmes interviews David sackett:' how much can we trust the guidelines?' [^9a0f6028]. European Heart Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Diagnostic component vs. therapeutic component of guidelines

SH: All right, I can agree that some of the topics you mentioned can apply to treatment, but what about guidelines for diagnosis? It is very difficult to force the diagnostic process of a disease into a series of practical behavioural recommendations. To me, the diagnostic act itself has a 'creative' and 'intuitive' component that is difficult to describe by numbers or by fixed steps. This is especially true for the first of the two moments of diagnosis, i.e. 'suspicion'. Even though my investigative method is frequently described as 'deductive' (from the general to the particular) or 'inductive' (from particular to general), in reality, it is an 'abductive' process. To use the words of the philosopher C S Peirce 'Abduction is the process of forming an explanatory hypothesis'. Actually, induction establishes a rule, whilst deduction merely develops the necessary consequences of a given hypothesis. Only 'abduction' leads to a new hypothesis (that of course has to be confirmed). Good detectives and good clinicians share the same underlying approach as scientific researchers (Karl Popper's hypothetic-deductive model).

DS: good point, I must admit! I agree that there is an initial moment of abductive reasoning required, which is closely linked to individual intuition and experience. Following on its heels, however, there must be an orderly process of selecting which instrumental and laboratory tests can best lead one to the definitive diagnosis, and this process has to be evidence-validated.

### "Has anything changed since then? ": a framework to incorporate prior goals-of-care conversations into decision-making for acutely ill patients [^0f0b4b76]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2021). Medium credibility.

When assuming care for a seriously ill hospitalized patient, we should find documentation of previous decisions about goals of care so that our conversation takes advantage of previous discussions and reduces decision-making burden on the patient, particularly when the patient is clinically declining and time is short. This article presents a framework to help clinicians incorporate prior goals of care conversations into decision-making for an acutely ill patient. When there is strong evidence that a previous decision still applies, clinicians should, after a brief check-in about the previous decision with the patient, then present a plan consistent with their previous decision as a default option, to which they can opt out. If there is less evidence of the basis for a previous decision, clinicians should explore the thinking behind the decision and, if there is clarity about patient preferences, propose a treatment plan. If there is conflict or uncertainty about the patient's preferences, clinicians should engage in a more comprehensive goals-of-care conversation, which involves exploring the patient's understanding of their illness, patient values, and reasonable treatment options, before offering a plan. By giving the patient the ability to opt out of a previous decision they made about goals of care, rather than another choice, we make it more likely that they will receive care consistent with their known wishes.

### Deciphering data: how should clinical trials change your clinical practice? [^7def0443]. Injury (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The careful consideration of how to apply findings from the scientific literature is important to every physician's clinical practice. This can pose a difficult task, particularly with the increasing speed of technological advances and complexity involved in modern clinical trials. This review introduces a new method, the WHOM criteria (Who, How, Outcomes, Minimizing bias), from which orthopedic surgeons and other physicians can efficiently evaluate novel medical literature for inclusion into their clinical practice.

Whom Criteria

The WHOM framework consists of four steps. The first step, Who, involves confirming whether a sample population studied is similar to one's patient under treatment, in order to ensure the results can be reasonably applied. Second, the How, comprises evaluating the intervention performed and ensuring that it could be reasonably replicated. The third step requires thoroughly evaluating the outcomes used in the study so as to ensure they are clinically meaningful to both the treating physician and the patient. Finally, there must be a careful evaluation of potential sources of bias and the ways in which errors and bias were minimized in all phases of the study.

Conclusion

Evidence-based practice should drive clinical decision making whenever the necessary literature is available. This requires the careful evaluation of new literature on a regular basis so that physicians can render safe and effective health care in partnership with their patients. The WHOM criteria are described in order to aid clinicians in navigating published research and change practice when appropriate.

### Elective ventilation for organ donation: law, policy and public ethics [^6386ce03]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2013). Low credibility.

Best interests and basic elective ventilation

Applied to what I am here calling basic elective ventilation, current legal requirements do not simply suggest its permissibility, but that it can be mandatory. The justification is person-centred, not utilitarian. It relies on respect for finding and applying the patient's own values. As such, the potential legality of basic elective ventilation is not in doubt. There will be clear instances where it is the indicated course of action and medical decision-makers will thus be bound, according to the patient's best interests, to continue harmless, modest measures to optimise the chances of successful donation after treatment is withdrawn. In 1996 it would have rightly been judged unlawful to support such a policy simply on the basis of reasoning such as that advanced in defence of the Exeter Protocol. Furthermore, English law's best interests standard at that time was not apt to include altruistic values. At the time of writing (2012), however, basic elective ventilation's lawfulness is clear when it does no harm and advances the patient's own interests in achieving an end that he valued.

Best interests and epistemically complex elective ventilation

Epistemically complex elective ventilation also falls within the bounds of being lawful. The General Medical Council's guidance on end-of-life care says at paragraph 31, under the heading 'Addressing uncertainty':

If there is a reasonable degree of uncertainty about whether a particular treatment will provide overall benefit for a patient who lacks capacity to make the decision, the treatment should be started in order to allow a clearer assessment to be made.

It stands to reason that as far as the patient is concerned, it could be fundamentally important that consideration go to organ donation. Necessarily this is a probabilistic question. However, people are not merely benefited by substantial outcomes, but also by being exposed to probable benefits or defended from probable harms, whether or not these finally eventuate. For the question under issue, there are clear arguments that would support epistemically complex elective ventilation. There is a good enough chance in cases of meaningful uncertainty that a patient would want measures instituted to enhance posthumous donation, that a best interests appraisal would indicate continued ventilation while the inquiry was made.

Process safeguards specify that "Institutional committees should synthesize all available evidence about unrepresented older adults' treatment preferences," and "In all cases, a second opinion independent of the treating care team… are considered," to help build consensus on likely choices. Committees "must be aware of the well-documented historical and ongoing problems related to structural racism… and other health inequities," and "must guard against perpetuating the structural forces that create and sustain healthcare disparities along the lines of race, class, gender, sexuality, and other social classifications," with this population's vulnerability calling "for heightened awareness of potential biases."

### Decision support tools in the absence of equipoise: the case for vaccination [^3927a95f]. BMJ Public Health (2025). High credibility.

Emphasising personal choice can be at odds with public health's emphasis on the overall population. Yet, vaccination coverage in a given population is the result of multiple individual choices. Because the consequences of these individual vaccination decisions also impact a wider society, it is in the public interest to support these choices with trustworthy information. This is especially true when people make choices in the face of pervasive misinformation and disinformation and the politicisation of public health topics. The decline in vaccine uptake rates and the resurgence of vaccine-preventable diseases highlight the high relevance of this topic.

In times of fear and confusion, it is not only important to clearly communicate the benefits and harms of vaccination, but also to listen and respect other people's views. Approaching vaccination as a strict medical consideration does not do justice to the relevance of social processes, institutional trust and political trends. Considering how these factors shape individual concerns about vaccination improves our understanding of how to relate to vaccine-hesitant individuals and which factors drive acceptance. An open dialogue about concerns, emotions and values, which is central to shared decision-making, is a good starting point. Logically, we need to design tools that support this process. Decision support tools about vaccination should also reflect deep community engagement, political awareness and cultural sensitivity to build trust and ensure their relevance. This is best accomplished through collaboration in multidisciplinary teams of community members, clinicians, biomedical and social scientists and public health professionals.

Our understanding of how to design decision support tools has evolved, resulting in a body of knowledge about their practical use. We should also harness this potential to ethically promote public health interventions where it is essential to balance societal interests alongside respect for individual choice.

### Ethics needs principles – four can encompass the rest – and respect for autonomy should be "first among equals" [^56e20c4d]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2003). Low credibility.

It is hypothesised and argued that "the four principles of medical ethics" can explain and justify, alone or in combination, all the substantive and universalisable claims of medical ethics and probably of ethics more generally. A request is renewed for falsification of this hypothesis showing reason to reject any one of the principles or to require any additional principle(s) that can't be explained by one or some combination of the four principles. This approach is argued to be compatible with a wide variety of moral theories that are often themselves mutually incompatible. It affords a way forward in the context of intercultural ethics, that treads the delicate path between moral relativism and moral imperialism. Reasons are given for regarding the principle of respect for autonomy as "first among equals", not least because it is a necessary component of aspects of the other three. A plea is made for bioethicists to celebrate the approach as a basis for global moral ecumenism rather than mistakenly perceiving and denigrating it as an attempt at global moral imperialism.

### American cancer society guideline for the early detection of prostate cancer: update 2010 [^0db845a5]. CA (2010). Medium credibility.

Shared and informed decision making (IDM/SDM) for prostate cancer screening involves collaboration between the patient and health care provider, and health care providers have a particularly important role in the decision for or against testing. Providers can provide men with information on the benefits, limitations, and uncertainties, help men integrate knowledge of benefits and risks with their values to make a decision, and when a man prefers a less active role the provider may use his or her discretion in deciding whether to recommend screening and should incorporate any knowledge of the patient's health preferences and values. Although there are no established criteria for all key information, core elements identified by review and expert consensus should be included in patient discussions and decision aids. Offering values‑oriented scenarios is one technique to help men integrate values with information; while there is no evidence to support superiority of this approach, randomized trial evidence shows a values‑matching decision aid can help to lower men's decisional conflict. Key obstacles to IDM/SDM cited by providers are time constraints and the complexity of the issue, and survey findings showed prostate cancer discussions often did not meet recommended criteria because they were not balanced and typically did not engage men to determine personal preferences. Patient decision aids can serve as effective adjunctive tools; the ideal decision aid should provide balanced information regarding screening options, reflect up‑to‑date information regarding benefits and risks, provide methods for clarifying values, and suggest ways to discuss the decision with health care providers. Decision aids are available in print, web‑based, and CD format, and low‑literacy versions have been developed but are not yet widely available. Criteria for selecting high‑quality decision aids are available from the International Patient Decision Aids Standards (IPDAS) Collaboration; several aids have been evaluated against these criteria and those accessible online are listed in Table 1. When selecting a tool, it is important that it reflects the latest key information or that the health care provider is able to supplement an otherwise effective tool with the latest data.

### How should morality play a role in global health? [^c04d5c50]. BMJ Global Health (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Global health is an interdisciplinary field focused on the improvement of health equity and outcomes across the world's populations, addressing transnational health challenges through cooperative international action. Differing from traditional medicine or public health, global health gives precedence to cross-frontier collaboration, strengthening of the health system and reduction of global health disparities.

In this commentary, we argue that moral clarity must be reasserted as a central pillar of global health practice. Integrating morality into decision-making is foundational to addressing inequities and ensuring inclusivity. By blending operational excellence with ethical clarity, defined here as the deliberate and consistent application of ethical reasoning, human rights and inclusiveness, global health can move beyond just addressing gaps; it can build systems rooted in fairness, compassion and shared humanity. The suggested pyramid (figure 1) delineates the hierarchical framework through which morality informs global health practices.

Figure 1
Suggested pyramid delineates the hierarchical framework through which morality informs global health practices. At the foundational level, institutional requirement represents the necessary legal, regulatory and organisational infrastructure that supports global health initiatives. Building on this base, diversity, equality and equity emerge as essential principles, underscoring the need to address health disparities and ensure that marginalised and vulnerable populations receive adequate attention and care. The next level, ethical framework, provides ethical guidelines that direct global health decisions, emphasising justice, fairness and accountability. Health and human rights illustrates the intrinsic link between access to health care and fundamental human rights. Universal health coverage follows as a core pillar of global health advocating for the provision of health services without financial barriers. Utilitarianism reflects the application of the greatest good for the greatest number. This moral philosophy is frequently used in health resource allocation, where decisions are made to maximise overall well-being, particularly in resource-constrained settings. At the apex is moral clarity and framework, which synthesises all the principles into a cohesive, overarching moral approach to global health.

### National consensus project clinical practice guidelines for quality palliative care guidelines, 4th edition [^010b9d00]. Journal of Palliative Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Ethical and legal aspects of care — global ethical principles for palliative care: The palliative care interdisciplinary team (IDT) applies ethical principles to patients with serious illness, honoring patient preferences and decisions by legal proxies or surrogate decision-makers, and in all cases surrogates' obligations are to represent the patient's preferences or best interests. Familiarity with local and state laws is needed for advance care planning, life-sustaining treatment decisions, and evolving treatments with legal ramifications (eg, medical marijuana), especially for vulnerable populations such as minors, prisoners, or those with developmental disability or psychiatric illness. The core ethical principles of autonomy, substituted judgment, beneficence, justice, and nonmaleficence underpin the provision of palliative care. Criteria state that palliative care is modeled on existing professional codes of ethics, conflicts of interest, scopes of practice, and standards of care; that all IDT members have education in fundamental ethical, legal, and regulatory principles; that clinicians aim to prevent, identify, and resolve ethical dilemmas (including forgoing or discontinuing treatments, instituting do not resuscitate orders or other state-specific portable medical orders such as POLST/MOLST, and the use of sedation of the imminently dying); that ethical issues are documented and referrals are made to ethics consultants or an ethics committee for case consultation and assistance in decision-making and conflict resolution as needed; and that ethics consultants or committees guide policy development and provide staff education in areas such as medically non-beneficial care, a patient's right to decline treatments of any kind, cessation of medically provided nutrition and hydration, foregoing or discontinuing technology (eg, ventilators, dialysis), use of high-dose medications, sedation of the imminently dying, and requests for physician-assisted death.

### Priority setting and personal health responsibility: an analysis of Norwegian key policy documents [^e51404d6]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2022). Medium credibility.

Objections to responsibility attributions

The idea that individuals are responsible for their actions and behaviour has been the subject of theoretical discussions involving the plausibility of free will, the conditionality of voluntariness and the definition of the boundaries to individual freedom. These fundamental metaphysical issues, together with empirical evidence on the social determinants of health, as well as findings from neuropsychology on the role that conscious choice plays in our actions, question whether individuals can be the subjects of responsibility attributions altogether. These questions are at the root of two main objections to personal responsibility for health. First, one of the conditions for being able to attribute responsibility to somebody for something is that the subject of responsibility has acted freely and could have done otherwise at the time of the action. The avoidability objection claims that for many health-related behaviours, the condition of voluntary and full-informed choice is not satisfied. For instance, substance addiction, the inability to understand health information and numerous socioeconomic factors set constraints on lifestyle choices. Second, the actions and behaviours of the individual must be the actual cause of ill health. Given the importance of exogenous contributing factors beyond individual control, such as genetic predispositions and biological factors, the causation objection explains why determining the extent to which the patient's healthcare needs are caused by lifestyle is difficult.

Other objections concern the practical implementation of personal health responsibility. The harshness objection states that it would be too harsh to make treatment conditional on the individual's own health responsibility because the public has a moral obligation for taking care of individuals in need even when the illness is perceived as self-inflicted. The intrusiveness objection points to the fact that the process of ascription of responsibility may be experienced as an invasion of the individual private sphere that could bring about feelings of shame and distrust. Finally, given the relationship between socioeconomic status and health-related behaviours, the inequity objection holds that the attribution of personal health responsibility could disproportionately harm the worst-off, reinforcing inequities. This objection is based on empirical studies of the distribution of unhealthy lifestyles in populations, showing socioeconomic gradients in clusters of health-related behaviours.

### CONSORT 2010 explanation and elaboration: updated guidelines for reporting parallel group randomised trials [^ca1dcdbd]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Item 7b. When applicable, explanation of any interim analyses and stopping guidelines

Examples — "Two interim analyses were performed during the trial. The levels of significance maintained an overall P value of 0.05 and were calculated according to the O'Brien-Fleming stopping boundaries. This final analysis used a Z score of 1.985 with an associated P value of 0.0471."

"An independent data and safety monitoring board periodically reviewed the efficacy and safety data. Stopping rules were based on modified Haybittle-Peto boundaries of 4 SD in the first half of the study and 3 SD in the second half for efficacy data, and 3 SD in the first half of the study and 2 SD in the second half for safety data. Two formal interim analyses of efficacy were performed when 50% and 75% of the expected number of primary events had accrued; no correction of the reported P value for these interim tests was performed."

Explanation — Many trials recruit participants over a long period. If an intervention is working particularly well or badly, the study may need to be ended early for ethical reasons. This concern can be addressed by examining results as the data accumulate, preferably by an independent data monitoring committee. However, performing multiple statistical examinations of accumulating data without appropriate correction can lead to erroneous results and interpretations. If the accumulating data from a trial are examined at five interim analyses that use a P value of 0.05, the overall false positive rate is nearer to 19% than to the nominal 5%.

Several group sequential statistical methods are available to adjust for multiple analyses, and their use should be pre-specified in the trial protocol. With these methods, data are compared at each interim analysis, and a P value less than the critical value specified by the group sequential method indicates statistical significance. Some trialists use group sequential methods as an aid to decision making, whereas others treat them as a formal stopping rule (with the intention that the trial will cease if the observed P value is smaller than the critical value).

Authors should report whether they or a data monitoring committee took multiple "looks" at the data and, if so, how many there were, what triggered them, the statistical methods used (including any formal stopping rule), and whether they were planned before the start of the trial, before the data monitoring committee saw any interim data by allocation, or some time thereafter. This information is often not included in published trial reports, even in trials that report stopping earlier than planned.

### What are frailty instruments for? [^75af601a]. Age and Ageing (2015). Low credibility.

Frailty is measured to understand its nature and biology, to aid diagnosis and care planning, to measure outcomes and to stratify risk. Such goals oblige two types of frailty measures - for screening and for assessment - and recognition that not all measures will serve all purposes. When the goal is broad identification of people at risk, a dichotomised approach (frailty is present or absent) is appropriate. If, however, the degree of risk varies, strategies to test grades of frailty will be required. Frailty measures should be implemented and evaluated in relation to the goal for their use.

### Using the recommended summary plan for emergency care and treatment (ReSPECT) in a community setting: does it facilitate best interests decision-making? [^88ef6df4]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2025). Medium credibility.

In theory, ECTPs, including ReSPECT, can facilitate best interests decision-making in an emergency by providing evidence of the patient's preferences regarding treatment and an indication of what is important to them for an acceptable life. However, the patient's preferences may have changed over time, and it is sometimes unclear whether patient preferences and values were sufficiently explored during the ReSPECT conversation and considered when writing recommendations.

This ambiguity regarding the weight to be given to ReSPECT recommendations can be challenging for clinician decision-makers and may lead to treatment decisions inconsistent with what the patient would have wanted or their overall best interests. As commentaries on POLST have noted, these risks are reduced when ECTPs are used for a person with a specific life-limiting illness and clearly defined future emergency scenarios. However, this is not the case for many people for whom ECTPs such as ReSPECT are being advocated. The importance of context and flexibility in using and interpreting tools such as ReSPECT for individual patients needs to be carefully considered. In the UK, previous experience with end-of-life care protocols, such as the Liverpool Care Pathway, underscores this message. This reflects a wider discourse on the tension between clinical guidelines and individualised patient care.

Our findings convey the importance of including information about patients' values and preferences on ReSPECT plans, beyond binary decision-making for or against certain treatments. In our earlier study of hospital-issued ReSPECT forms, we found that information on patient preferences was rarely recorded. In our recent analysis of community-issued ReSPECT forms, just over half of the forms featured information on patient preferences and/or values. Explicitly considering the person's previously expressed values and preferences is part of a best interests decision-making process and is a requirement under the Mental Capacity Act. Recording such information reflects the values of person-centred careand, in an emergency, would allow clinicians to interpret relevant recommendations contextually and make best interests decisions aligned with patients' values.

This study is the first to triangulate viewpoints from key stakeholders in the ReSPECT process within community contexts, including patients and relatives, care home staff members and primary care clinicians. Our study was limited by the under-representation of people from minority ethnic groups in the patient/relative data. Further research is needed to examine ReSPECT decision-making in emergency situations and include ambulance staff and other out-of-hours responders.

### Choice is not the issue. the misrepresentation of healthcare in bioethical discourse [^45f9a07e]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

The principle of respect for autonomy entered the realm of medicine primarily as a barrier to abuse in the name of science. The disclosure of human exploitation in medical experiments during and after World War II led to calls for the greater protection of research participants, and the Nuremberg Code of 1947 declared that the voluntary consent of the human subject is absolutely essential. The autonomy principle was carried over to clinical medicine, probably facilitated by human rights movements and a rising discontent with authoritarian and paternalistic doctors. While autonomy is a multifaceted term in philosophy, signifying authenticity and self-legislative authority, the notion still relates to informed consent in healthcare. Discussions have centred on decision making and patient choice, with movements like 'shared decision making' and 'patient centred medicine'. In perhaps the most influential book in bioethics, Principles of Biomedical Ethics, the principle of autonomy is explicitly formulated as respecting autonomous choice, which is now the most common denotation of the concept in bioethics.

Despite its influence, the status of the principle is controversial. The individualistic interpretation of autonomy is said to reflect the specific American context, while some have pointed out that relational dimensions also have moral significance. Others assert that the significant emphasis on patient autonomy has led to the underdevelopment of other important moral values, such as beneficence and justice. Moreover, autonomy is claimed to represent an ideal that fits poorly with clinical practice, since patients are, by definition, unwell and in need of help, and therefore often lack the competence and independence that the principle presupposes.

While this critique seems appropriate, a central problem is rarely mentioned: while choices in medical research are well defined, this is often not the case in healthcare practice. The Norwegian healthcare system, which serves as the basis for our reflections, is predominantly public, and patients in other countries may have greater influence. Nevertheless, patients cannot generally choose any treatment they desire, and only have a formal right to refuse treatment. These are the conditions of the healthcare system in our society, and they are often underplayed in the autonomy debate. The right to choose presupposes a kind of open choice that is, in fact, rare in healthcare, and this makes 'patient choice' a misleading way of characterising clinical practice.

### Defending the four principles approach as a good basis for good medical practice and therefore for good medical ethics [^4378db27]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2015). Low credibility.

This paper argues that the four prima facie principles-beneficence, non-maleficence, respect for autonomy and justice-afford a good and widely acceptable basis for 'doing good medical ethics'. It confronts objections that the approach is simplistic, incompatible with a virtue-based approach to medicine, that it requires respect for autonomy always to have priority when the principles clash at the expense of clinical obligations to benefit patients and global justice. It agrees that the approach does not provide universalisable methods either for resolving such moral dilemmas arising from conflict between the principles or their derivatives, or universalisable methods for resolving disagreements about the scope of these principles-long acknowledged lacunae but arguably to be found, in practice, with all other approaches to medical ethics. The value of the approach, when properly understood, is to provide a universalisable though prima facie set of moral commitments which all doctors can accept, a basic moral language and a basic moral analytic framework. These can underpin an intercultural 'moral mission statement' for the goals and practice of medicine.

### Effective use of tables and figures in abstracts, presentations, and papers [^9d553efc]. Respiratory Care (2004). Low credibility.

In some situations, tables, graphs, and figures can present certain types of information (including complicated relationships and sequences of events) more clearly and in less space than the same information would require in sentence form. However, do not use tables, graphs, and figures for small amounts of data that could be conveyed clearly and succinctly in a sentence. Also, do not reiterate in sentences the data that are shown in a table, graph, or figure: the point of creating a table or graph or figure is to eliminate that type of sentence from your manuscript. In building a data table you must balance the necessity that the table be complete with the equally important necessity that it not be too complex. Sometimes it is helpful to break a large table into several smaller ones to allow the reader to identify important information easily, but, conversely, it is a common mistake of novice authors to split up into several tables data that belong in one table. In almost all cases, only one table or graph or figure should be included in an abstract, and then only if it can convey essential information in less space and in a more easily interpretable way than the sentence form. For a poster, in almost all instances you should use only one typeface and one font in a table, graph, or figure. In general, do not use bold, italics, or color unless you are presenting a great deal of data and you need to highlight certain data values and you are certain that using bold, italics, or color will improve readability, which is rare. Do not include identical information in a table and a graph/figure. In reporting a clinical trial you will need to include a patient flow chart that identifies the number of patients initially screened for the study, the number of patients who were excluded (and why) after initial screening or in the final analysis, and how many patients entered, exited early, and completed each arm of the study. A treatment protocol should also be described with a flow chart. In preparing a graph the most common error is to include a line that suggests an unsubstantiated extrapolation between or beyond the data points. In selecting the graph's axes, avoid truncating, enlarging, or compressing the axes in ways that might make the graph confusing or misleading. To prepare clear, accurate, easily interpretable tables, graphs, and figures, rely on the rules described in authoritative guides such as the Council of Science Editors' Scientific Style and Format and the American Medical Association's Manual of Style.

### Providing quality family planning services in the United States: recommendations of the U.S. Office of Population Affairs (revised 2024) [^7c38b76a]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Quality counseling — Quality counseling is fundamental to the delivery of person-centered care, and Five key principles guide quality counseling: Establish and maintain rapport with the person; Assess the person's preferences, values, and goals; personalize discussions accordingly; Work with the person to interactively establish a plan; Provide accurate and understandable information that supports the person's desires; and Confirm understanding. Rapport is fundamental for establishing trust and open communication and has been shown to affect outcomes, including patient satisfaction, and can be fostered by simple acts such as a warm welcome, a handshake, and "taking the time to connect as human beings". Assessment should encompass not only the type of care but also the type of information a person might want or need as well as how a person prefers to receive information and make decisions, and clinicians should meet people where they are and avoid attempts to redirect their goals while setting aside personal biases that may conflict with patient preferences and working to support the patient's desired outcomes. Plan development includes setting goals, using a strengths-based approach in discussing possible difficulties, developing action plans to deal with these difficulties, and grounding plans in the individual's own goals, interests, and readiness for change. Educational materials and decision aids should be offered in a variety of formats (written, audio/visual, video, interactive) to enable patients to select the format(s) that work best for them. Test all educational materials with the intended audiences for clarity and comprehension before wide-scale use, specifically involving individuals who are representative of the populations served. To confirm understanding, asking people to repeat back what they heard ("teach-back") can be a helpful way of confirming their understanding and determining what additional information sharing may be needed.

### A practical guide for understanding confidence intervals and P values [^c0a7d4a0]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

The 95 percent confidence interval about the mean demarcates the range of values in which the mean would fall if many samples from the universal parent population were taken. In other words, if the same observation, experiment, or trial were done over and over with a different sample of subjects, but with the same characteristics as the original sample, 95 percent of the means from those repeated measures would fall within this range. This gives a measure of how confident we are in the original mean. It tells us not only whether the results are statistically significant because the CI falls totally on one side or the other of the no difference marker (0 if continuous variables; 1 if proportions), but also the actual values so that we might determine if the data seem clinically important. In contrast, the P value tells us only whether the results are statistically significant, without translating that information into values relative to the variable that was measured. Consequently, the CI is a better choice to describe the results of observations, experiments, or trials.

### Ethical considerations in xenotransplantation of thoracic organs-a call for a debate on value based decisions [^c1e94276]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2024). High credibility.

Xenotransplantation (XTx) infectious disease and public health — The page reports that "no transmission of viruses or other zoonoses to third parties has been detected in the experimental models of pig-to-human transplant" and describes that in the first porcine heart recipient "porcine cytomegalovirus (pCMV) was observed in the donor heart at time of autopsy… whether it contributed to the death of the recipient is presently still unclear." It underscores that "the infectious disease surveillance of the recipient after the transplant would be motivated not only by the best interest of the recipient, but also by the interest of the recipient's contacts and in the interest of the global society," and poses key governance questions: "What principles should guide us regarding the risk of animal-to-human transmission of porcine retroviruses or other infectious agents?", "Who carries the burden to prove that the individual and societal risk is sufficiently low… after the transplant?", "Do different risk thresholds apply for other zoonoses where the risk to close contacts and society is less clear?", and "Are the risk of infections different in pediatric XTx?".

### Proportional change: an additional method of reporting technical and functional outcomes following clinical interventions [^45763dcc]. European Journal of Neurology (2001). Low credibility.

One of the major challenges in disability management research is to express results in a manner that can be generalized to subjects with varying degrees of disability. Absolute measurements of change are often dependent on initial characteristics, in which case they can only be generalized to subjects with the same characteristics. We define proportional change as the ratio of change to the maximum possible or targeted change. It can be assessed in any situation where a maximum possible or targeted change is definable. Its estimated value will be sensitive to the choice of denominator. Subjective assessments, such as those measured with Likert scales, are naturally expressed as proportional change with the denominator being set by the subject. Denominators may also be determined objectively by physical limitations or, less desirably, by the measurement tool. Where there is no readily or objectively determinable denominator, they should be chosen for each subject in advance of the intervention according to carefully specified criteria. Proportional change is proposed, as an adjunct to the reporting of absolute measures of change following therapeutic interventions, as a means of expressing change in a manner that is both individualized and generalizable.

### Why questionnaire scores are not measures: a question-raising article [^3d475008]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2023). Medium credibility.

The Puzzle of Missing Values

Missing items are common in questionnaires, resulting from different reasons. Typical examples are made by subjects who may inadvertently skip over some questions or may not have enough time to complete the test. Subjects would prefer not to answer if higher penalties are assigned to wrong than missing answers. Sometimes, some items are reserved to some respondents, for example, those who attempted in the past a given activity or have other characteristics such as sex or language.

When missing answers are found, the easiest and most practiced solution would be to transform scores into the percentage of the total score given by the answered items. For example, if a subject misses two items and totals seven on a questionnaire of 10 dichotomous items, the subject's "total score" is 87.5% (7/8). Note that this procedure is equivalent to the common "mean substitution" procedure, assigning the missing items the average score observed in the other items. This method relies on the (strong and unlikely) assumption that questionnaires' items are all indicators of the same quantity of the latent variable of interest and thus exchangeable (i.e. they all share the same difficulty level).

Table 2 provides an example showing why this solution does not work. Suppose 10 items again, each scored 0 or 1, aligned from left to right for increasing difficulty. The "x" symbol flags a missing response. According to traditional psychometrics, subjects A and B are assigned the same score. Subject C, providing two missing answers, is assigned a lower score. However, it seems that subject A's missing response should be given a higher score estimate, given that the subject passed five more difficult items. In contrast, subject B failed three items easier than the missed one. It is doubtful that subject C deserves a lower score than subject B: he/she passed four items more difficult than the missed items.

TABLE 2
Estimation of missing values, based on average scores across answered items

Presumably, subjects A and C were careless in their answers or had not enough time to complete the test.

This example is intentionally simplistic. The treatment of missing data is a complex research field, faced by the whole field of statistics. As far as psychometric statistics is concerned, RA provides a satisfactory answer to this problem.

### 2025 AHA / ACC statement on cost / value methodology in clinical practice guidelines (update from 2014 statement): a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^6dc255dc]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

AHA/ACC cost/value methodology — cost-effectiveness metrics defines and applies the ICER as follows: The most widely used metric of cost-effectiveness is the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio or ICER, defined as the ratio of the net increase in spending of the intervention versus the comparator to the net increase or improvement in outcome. In a pairwise comparison, interventions that produce higher costs and better health outcomes should be reported as cost-effective if the ICER is less than the cost-effectiveness threshold or not cost-effective if the ICER is greater than or equal to the cost-effectiveness threshold. Economic value statements should include both the point estimate as well as the probability of being cost-effective at the accepted cost-effectiveness threshold when available. Although it is reasonable for the supporting text accompanying the economic value statement to report uncertainty intervals around the ICER when results are within 1 quadrant of the cost-effectiveness plane, the probabilistic findings may be easier to interpret. Incremental CEA methods should be used when evaluating 3 or more mutually exclusive interventions. Of note, interventions that are less effective and have lower costs relative to the comparator are considered cost-effective if the ICER is greater than the cost-effectiveness threshold, which necessitates careful interpretation. Interventions that produce lower costs and better health outcomes than the comparator should be reported in economic value statements as cost-saving (or "dominant"); interventions that produce higher costs and worse health outcomes than the comparator should be reported in economic value statements as inferior (or "dominated"). Negative ICERs should not be reported because they are not interpretable.

### APA guidelines on evidence-based psychological practice in health care [^8505dc61]. APA (2021). High credibility.

Collaborative treatment planning in psychological practice — psychologists seek to participate in collaborative treatment planning with patients and others when appropriate. Shared decision-making is the process through which the psychologist, the patient, and, when appropriate, others jointly discuss treatment options to develop a treatment plan consistent with the patient's goals and needs, and treatment planning typically includes consideration of the relative benefits and risks of each treatment option as well as the possibility of no treatment, and it is documented as part of the informed consent process. Psychologists strive to engage patients and appropriate others in collaborative discussions about treatment, typically begin treatment planning by ensuring that patients understand their rights and responsibilities related to treatment in accordance with the ethical mandate for informed consent, and seek to share information about different treatment methods, the efficacy of each method, and the associated risks and side effects; they also acknowledge when the efficacy of a particular treatment has not been adequately evaluated. When recommending a treatment, they strive to rely on the best available research, their clinical expertise, applicability of the treatment to the setting and patient characteristics, as well as patient values and preferences, and they aim to avoid treatments that have been discredited or found harmful. Psychologists actively seek patients' input during treatment planning, frequently inquire about patients' goals for treatment and work towards agreement on how they will collaborate to achieve these goals, aspire to respect their patients' autonomy and do not coerce them to participate in an unwanted or aversive treatment, and in most cases, the patient makes the final treatment decision. Exceptions include situations involving immediate risk to the patient or others, crises and threats to safety or stability, or lack of decisional capacity; at times, crisis situations and patient safety may compel psychologists to provide services in the absence of patient consent, in which instances they attempt to involve relevant others in treatment decisions as appropriate and share important information and decisions with the patient to the extent possible, and when stabilization and safety are attained, more collaborative discussions can occur. When research evidence is limited, psychologists attempt to proceed cautiously based on the best available research relevant to the clinical situation, their clinical expertise, consultation with knowledgeable colleagues, and patient input; psychologists appreciate that no treatment is universally efficacious and that different patients may respond differently to any given treatment, and if a patient has a history of non-response to a given treatment, the psychologist attempts to understand why the prior treatment was not successful, tries to assess any current treatment barriers, and recommends the most suitable treatment course based on the information learned.

### Family members, ambulance clinicians and attempting CPR in the community: the ethical and legal imperative to reach collaborative consensus at speed [^89e75fff]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2021). Medium credibility.

In all situations, the first step is to consider whether the person has capacity to make their own decision — to consent to or refuse CPR. In the scenario presented by Rob Cole, as with almost all situations where CPR is required, the patient was unconscious and there were no practicable steps that could be taken to support him within the time available: reaching the conclusion that the patient did not have capacity could therefore have been effectively instantaneous.

The paramedics had taken reasonable steps to ascertain whether the person had made an advance decision to refuse CPR (as a medical treatment), and that he had not made one.

This means that they were therefore required to decide whether it was in his best interests for them to attempt it.

'Best interests' is, deliberately, not defined in the MCA 2005. However, s.4 sets out a series of matters that must be considered whenever a person is determining what is in the person's best interests to allow them to have a reasonable belief as to they are acting in those best interests. It is extremely important to recognise that the MCA 2005 does not specify what is in the person's best interests. Rather, it sets down a process by which that conclusion should be reached, which recognises that a lack of decision-making capacity is not an 'off-switch' for their rights and freedom (Wye Valley NHS Trust v- Mr B]2015[EWCOP 60 in paragraph 11). The process aims to construct a decision on behalf of the person who cannot make that decision themselves. As the Supreme Court emphasised in Aintree University NHS Hospitals Trust v James [2014] UKSC 67 "[t]he purpose of the best interests test is to consider matters from the patient's point of view." It is critically important to understand that the purpose of the decision-making process is to try to arrive at the decision that is the right decision for the person themselves, as an individual human being, and not the decision that best fits with the outcome that the professionals desire. Any information about the patient's wishes, feelings, beliefs and values will be relevant, including, in particular, preferences and recommendations documented when the person had capacity.

### 2025 AHA / ACC statement on cost / value methodology in clinical practice guidelines (update from 2014 statement): a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^4d080661]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

AHA/ACC cost/value methodology — health outcomes and quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) use notes that "the health outcomes of an intervention relative to the comparator may be a change in the incidence of clinical events… or change in survival (ie, life years gained)," and that the QALY "is calculated by multiplying the health-related quality of life associated with a health state with the time spent in that state." Health-related quality of life is "measured on a scale from 0 to 1, where 0 represents death and 1 represents perfect health." For preference weights, those "elicited from a representative sample of fully informed members of the community are generally preferred," though "some experts have argued that economic and ethical principles support the use of quality-of-life estimates elicited from patients who are directly affected by the condition." Important limitations include that higher baseline quality-of-life gains "generate more QALYs than an equivalent gain in survival" in lower-baseline groups, which "translates to a comparatively higher valuation" and raises concerns about exacerbating health disparities, and the assumption of indifference between quality-of-life versus longevity changes yielding the same net QALYs, "which is often not the case." Alternatives "including the 'equal value of life-years gained' and the 'health years in total'" have "not been uniformly adopted by major health technology assessment agencies"; "cost-effectiveness thresholds have not been established for some of these newer metrics," and results using them are "not directly comparable to the results of studies that report incremental cost per QALYs gained." The statement adds that "economic value statements should incorporate findings from available CEAs that measure health outcomes in terms of QALYs and life years."

### Committee opinion no. 664: refusal of medically recommended treatment during pregnancy [^f4bdc536]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2016). Medium credibility.

Obstetric care — determining decisional capacity states that patients are, by law, presumed to be decisionally capable unless formally determined otherwise, and clinicians should not infer from a refusal that a patient's capacity is diminished. Disagreement with a physician's recommendations is not, per se, evidence of decisional incapacity, and although psychiatric consultation may justifiably be sought when decisionmaking capacity is in question, in no circumstance should a psychiatric consultation be used as a punitive measure or as a means to coerce a specific decision. Genuine differences in risk assessment, collective interests, and religious or cultural meanings may lead decisionally capable patients to choose options other than those strongly recommended. When a patient has been determined to lack decisional capacity, the decisions of her legally authorized surrogate generally should be honored and should reflect the patient's previously expressed values and preferences when known.

### Brief resolved unexplained events (formerly apparent life-threatening events) and evaluation of lower-risk infants [^ecd6a65a]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

Recommendation strength interpretation — language cues and definitions: Strong and moderate recommendations are associated with "should" and "should not" statements, whereas a weak recommendation may be recognized by "may" or "need not." A strong recommendation means the benefits of the recommended approach clearly exceed the harms (or, for a strong negative recommendation, the harms clearly exceed the benefits) and the supporting evidence quality is excellent; clinicians are advised to follow such guidance unless a clear and compelling rationale for acting in a contrary manner is present. A moderate recommendation means the committee believes benefits exceed harms (or harms exceed benefits for a negative recommendation) but the evidence on which the recommendation is based is not as strong, and clinicians are encouraged to follow such guidance while remaining alert to new information and sensitive to patient preferences. A weak recommendation means the existing evidence quality is suspect or well-designed, well-conducted studies have shown little clear advantage to one approach versus another, offering clinicians flexibility in decision-making, although boundaries on alternatives may be set.

### An official multi-society statement: the role of clinical research results in the practice of critical care medicine [^f77c0e47]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

Negotiating between various kinds of medical knowledge — no set hierarchy of knowledge to guide clinical decision making in all situations is possible, and a ranking based on study design or quality measures cannot be directly applied to clinical decisions; clinicians must continue to rely on sound clinical judgment to negotiate between potentially conflicting facts and reasons, and explicitness is to be greatly valued, as clinicians should be able to identify and articulate the sources and kinds of knowledge invoked; the initial step is identifying pertinent medical knowledge, including clinical research, pathophysiologic understanding, and clinical experience, and since no kind of knowledge is always superior, simply relying upon a randomized controlled trial or meta-analysis will be insufficient; clinicians are obligated to consider information and knowledge that might suggest action that would run counter to that suggested by clinical research, and a clinician ought to be able to concisely outline and justify the process of clinical reasoning for scrutiny and revision.

### Applying the four principles [^07791614]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2003). Low credibility.

Gillon is correct that the four principles provide a sound and useful way of analysing moral dilemmas. As he observes, the approach using these principles does not provide a unique solution to dilemmas. This can be illustrated by alternatives to Gillon's own analysis of the four case scenarios. In the first scenario, a different set of factual assumptions could yield a different conclusion about what is required by the principle of beneficence. In the second scenario, although Gillon's conclusion is correct, what is open to question is his claim that what society regards as the child's best interest determines what really is in the child's best interest. The third scenario shows how it may be reasonable for the principle of beneficence to take precedence over autonomy in certain circumstances, yet like the first scenario, the ethical conclusion relies on a set of empirical assumptions and predictions of what is likely to occur. The fourth scenario illustrates how one can draw different conclusions based on the importance given to the precautionary principle.

### 2025 AHA / ACC statement on cost / value methodology in clinical practice guidelines (update from 2014 statement): a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^892b2769]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Interpreting older cost-effectiveness analyses (CEAs) — update and reporting practices emphasize that when relying on results from older CEAs, incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) should be updated prior to interpretation; ideally, older CEAs should be updated with new values of key input parameters, recognizing that updated analyses are not always available when guidelines are being prepared; interim developments may affect cost-effectiveness over time; adjusting intervention and comparator costs to contemporary US costs and inflating components of cost to a contemporary year may be a reasonable starting point if there have been no major interval changes in safety or effectiveness; analysts should inflate intervention and comparator costs separately from other health care costs and report original results together with the updated value version; in some cases it may be reasonable to rely on previously reported sensitivity analyses, but this approach is unlikely to work for all CEAs and a systematic update may be the only acceptable quantitative solution; given limited resources, a qualitative assessment of interval changes and whether they would increase or decrease the ICER may be reasonable, and older CEAs can still generate useful insights but merit cautious interpretation.

### Intuitions, principles and consequences [^8f27e0b2]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2001). Low credibility.

Some approaches to the assessment of moral intuitions are discussed. The controlled ethical trial isolates a moral issue from confounding factors and thereby clarifies what a person's intuition actually is. Casuistic reasoning from situations, where intuitions are clear, suggests or modifies principles, which can then help to make decisions in situations where intuitions are unclear. When intuitions are defended by a supporting principle, that principle can be tested by finding extreme cases, in which it is counterintuitive to follow the principle. An approach to the resolution of conflict between valid moral principles, specifically the utilitarian and justice principles, is considered. It is argued that even those who justify intuitions by a priori principles are often obliged to modify or support their principles by resort to the consideration of consequences.

### Introspective access to value-based multi-attribute choice processes [^19f70ba5]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Then, critically, we asked participants to rate the extent to which they believed the heuristic accurately described how they made their choices, on a continuous scale from "Strategy A much better describes how I made my choices" to "Strategy B much better describes how I made my choices". Finally, as an exploratory question, we asked participants to rate whether Strategy A or B better described how they believed one should make their choices in Part 1; we do not analyze this question in this manuscript.

Measuring people's beliefs about their attribute weights is complicated by the fact that participants might represent different formats of attribute weights depending on which heuristics they are using. A participant using the classically rational process (i.e. none of the heuristics in Table 1) will represent graded weights (i.e. from 0 to 1); a person using the binary weights heuristic will represent binary weights (i.e. each attribute has a weight of 1 or 0); and a person using the single attribute heuristic will represent weights that equal 1 for one attribute and 0 for the others.

To elicit participants' self-reported attribute weights without assuming which heuristic(s) they were using, we asked them to report their weights in all formats: graded, binary, and single-attribute (the order of the three types was randomized). To elicit graded attribute weights, we asked participants, for each attribute, to report the extent to which they had cared about that attribute when making their choices (on a 100-point scale from "Didn't care about it at all" to "It completely determined my choices", with 9 labels to mark spots on the scale; see SI 1.2 for exact scale). To elicit binary attribute weights, we presented a list of the attributes with check boxes next to them, and asked participants to check which attributes they had cared about when making their decisions. To elicit single attribute weights, we presented the list of attributes with radio buttons next to them, and asked participants to select which single attribute they had most used to make their decisions.

### Considerations in the determination of medical necessity in children: application to contractual language [^680c3741]. Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

Pediatric medical necessity — evidence standards and core pediatric criteria — states that for "currently available, existing services and interventions," effectiveness for children "should be based on the available scientific evidence"; if evidence is insufficient, "currently accepted professional standards of care for children must be considered," and if such standards "do not exist or are outdated or contradictory," decisions "must be made in light of consensus pediatric expert opinion" based on clinical experience and published clinical evidence. "Lack of conclusive scientific evidence should not automatically result in a decision to deny coverage of new or existing services and interventions." Medically necessary health interventions are "intended to promote normal growth and development and prevent, diagnose, detect, treat, ameliorate, or palliate the effects of a physical, mental, behavioral, genetic, or congenital condition, injury, or disability," and from a pediatric perspective such services should "assist in achieving, maintaining, or restoring health and functional capabilities without discrimination," "be appropriate for the age and developmental status of the child," "consider the setting that is appropriate to the specific needs of the child and family," and "reflect current bioethical standards." In addition to evidence, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services advocates determinations "be made in large part on the basis of the concepts of reasonableness and necessity."

### Surveys: an introduction [^18c7b4f6]. Respiratory Care (2004). Low credibility.

Surveys are a valuable research tool for studying the knowledge, attitudes, and behavior of a study population. This article explores quantitative analyses of written questionnaires as instruments for survey research. Obtaining accurate and precise information from a survey requires minimizing the possibility of bias from inappropriate sampling or a flawed survey instrument, and this article describes strategies to minimize sampling bias by increasing response rates, comparing responders to nonresponders, and identifying the appropriate sampling population. It is crucial that the survey instrument be valid, meaning that it actually measures what the investigator intends it to measure. In developing a valid survey instrument, it can be useful to adapt survey instruments that were developed by other researchers and to conduct extensive pilot-testing of your survey instrument.

### A guide to utilizing implementation science for genetic counseling [^5745e6e2]. Journal of Genetic Counseling (2025). Medium credibility.

3 UTILIZING IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE FOR QUALITY IMPROVEMENT AND SERVICE DELIVERY CHANGE

There are several steps that may help improve the successful implementation and sustainability of clinical interventions, programs, or service delivery approaches (THE THING). Although these steps are ordered below, the process is usually iterative, with any step being revisited and refined as new information is gathered.

3.1 Clarify your goal(s) and/or question(s)

As already discussed, IS goals and questions differ from typical research questions. For example, instead of asking whether THE THING works, IS questions might ask why THE THING worked differently at different sites or for different people. When determining goals and research questions, we find it helpful to categorize IS questions according to where they fall in the implementation continuum (Table 1). It may be possible to ask more than one research question in a single study, but typically we recommend ensuring at least some questions from earlier in the continuum are answered before trying to address questions later in the continuum, and this categorization can help ensure your questions stay aligned with where you are in the implementation continuum. Furthermore, even though the primary focus of IS is not whether THE THING works, it is still important to measure the actual effectiveness of THE THING in context (e.g. in "the real‐world") during IS studies, as IS seeks to determine what worked, for whom, and why. It should also be clear from Table 1 that assessing and understanding contextual factors (e.g. organizational structure, leadership support, resources, access to information about the intervention, etc.) is important across the entire continuum of implementation as contributors to implementation and sustainability.

### Environmental assessment and exposure reduction of cockroaches: a practice parameter [^6534c2ff]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2013). Medium credibility.

Classification of recommendations and evidence — recommendation rating scale defines Strong recommendation (StrRec), Recommendation (Rec), Option (Opt), and No recommendation (NoRec) with corresponding implications. Strong recommendation (StrRec): A strong recommendation means the benefits of the recommended approach clearly exceed the harms (or that the harms clearly exceed the benefits in the case of a strong negative recommendation) and that the quality of the supporting evidence is excellent (grade A or B).* In some clearly identified circumstances, strong recommendations might be made based on lesser evidence when high-quality evidence is impossible to obtain and the anticipated benefits strongly outweigh the harms. Clinicians should follow a strong recommendation unless a clear and compelling rationale for an alternative approach is present. Recommendation (Rec): A recommendation means the benefits exceed the harms (or that the harms clearly exceed the benefits in the case of a negative recommendation) but the quality of evidence is not as strong (grade B or C).* In some clearly identified circumstances, recommendations might be made based on lesser evidence when high-quality evidence is impossible to obtain and the anticipated benefits outweigh the harms. Clinicians should also generally follow a recommendation but should remain alert to new information and be sensitive to patient preferences. Option (Opt): An option means that either the quality of evidence that exists is suspect (grade D)* or that well-done studies (grade A, B, or C)* show little clear advantage to one approach versus another. Clinicians should be flexible in their decision-making regarding appropriate practice, although they might set bounds on alternatives; patient preference should have a substantial influencing role. No recommendation (NoRec): No recommendation means there is both a lack of pertinent evidence (grade D)* and an unclear balance between benefits and harms. Clinicians should feel little constraint in their decision-making and be alert to new published evidence that clarifies the balance of benefit versus harm; patient preference should have a substantial influencing role.

### Integrating quality into the cycle of therapeutic development [^697f93d8]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2002). Low credibility.

The quality of healthcare, particularly as reflected in current practice versus the available evidence, has become a major focus of national health policy discussions. Key components needed to provide quality care include: 1) development of quality indicators and performance measures from specific practice guidelines, 2) better ways to disseminate such guidelines and measures, and 3) development of support tools to promote standardized practice. Although rational decision-making and development of practice guidelines have relied upon results of randomized trials and outcomes studies, not all questions can be answered by randomized trials, and many treatment decisions necessarily reflect physiology, intuition, and experience when treating individuals. Debate about the role of "evidence-based medicine" also has raised questions about the value of applying trial results in practice, and some skepticism has arisen about whether advocated measures of clinical effectiveness, the basic definition of quality, truly reflect a worthwhile approach to improving medical practice. We provide a perspective on this issue by describing a model that integrates quantitative measurements of quality and performance into the development cycle of existing and future therapeutics. Such a model would serve as a basic approach to cardiovascular medicine that is necessary, but not sufficient, to those wishing to provide the best care for their patients.

### Best (but oft-forgotten) practices: sensitivity analyses in randomized controlled trials [^a559ed7f]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2016). Low credibility.

A randomized controlled clinical trial is the best way to minimize bias in ascertaining treatment effects, but the credibility of the results of a trial depends on the validity of the methods used to analyze the data, and the conditions under which such methods produce valid answers. A sensitivity analysis is a method to determine the robustness of trial findings by examining the extent to which results are affected by changes in methods, models, values of unmeasured variables, or assumptions. The goal of a sensitivity analysis is to identify results that are most dependent on questionable or unsupported assumptions. In this article, we briefly review the current use of sensitivity analyses in a random sample of published nutrition literature and provide a guide on the use of sensitivity analyses in randomized trials as to when to consider them, what to consider when planning them, and different methods of implementing them. We propose an 8-step strategy for improving the approach to conducting and reporting sensitivity analyses in nutrition-based trials.
