## Question

If hand bite by human, which anatomical part likely to become infected?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which anatomical part of the hand is most likely to become infected after a human bite, and why that location carries the highest risk. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the epidemiology and typical injury patterns of human bites to the hand. Then, I should verify the specific anatomy that predisposes to infection, especially the dorsal metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint region. Next, I will examine the pathophysiology of the "fight bite" mechanism and how it seeds deep structures. After that, I need to review the microbiology and the evidence base for infection risk and prophylaxis. Finally, I will synthesize the answer and outline the clinical implications for management and prevention of missed injuries.

> Let me first confirm the epidemiologic signal. Human bites predominantly involve the hand, and among hand injuries, clenched-fist ("fight bite") wounds to the dorsum of the MCP joint are the classic and most concerning pattern, frequently leading to deep infection if not recognized and treated promptly [^111qxQys] [^114b3AHg].

> Wait, let me verify the anatomic location precisely. The highest-risk site is the dorsal aspect of the hand over the metacarpophalangeal joints, particularly the third and fourth MCPs, where the extensor tendon, joint capsule, and metacarpal head are vulnerable to inoculation from a tooth strike during a punch [^114b3AHg] [^1129uApQ].

> I will now examine the mechanism to ensure the pathophysiology supports this risk ranking. When the fist strikes a mouth, the extensor hood and joint capsule can be lacerated over the MCP, inoculating oral flora into a relatively avascular synovial space. With finger motion, the wound tract migrates and may seal superficially, trapping bacteria and allowing rapid proliferation and spread along tendon sheaths and joints, explaining the high propensity for septic arthritis and tenosynovitis in this location [^114b3AHg] [^116Ddiid].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions without microbiology. I should confirm the typical pathogens. Human bite infections are polymicrobial, commonly including Streptococcus species, Staphylococcus aureus, Eikenella corrodens, and anaerobes such as Fusobacterium and Prevotella; Eikenella is particularly characteristic of human bites and contributes to the need for beta-lactamase–stable regimens [^113DUAZK] [^112pV4BS] [^114aDtoo].

> Next, I should review the evidence quantifying risk and the role of prophylaxis. Let me check the data: a Cochrane analysis found that prophylactic antibiotics significantly reduce infection after human bites and after bites to the hand specifically, with an odds ratio around 0.10 for hand bites, underscoring the inherently high baseline risk at this location. Observational series of clenched-fist injuries report infection rates ranging from roughly 12–20% when managed without timely operative care, and delayed presentation beyond 24 hours is consistently associated with higher complication rates [^1145Cuy8] [^112QDH35].

> But wait, what if other hand regions are sometimes cited as "most common" for infections? I need to ensure I'm not conflating frequency of infection with risk per exposure. Fingertip infections such as paronychia and felon are indeed common, but those are typically not human-bite related; in the specific context of human bites, the dorsal MCP region remains the highest-risk site due to the combination of mechanism, inoculum, and anatomy, whereas fingertip pulp infections more often follow other puncture mechanisms rather than human bites [^117RpAtH] [^114b3AHg].

> Let me synthesize and double-check the conclusion. The anatomical part of the hand most likely to become infected after a human bite is the dorsal metacarpophalangeal joint region, particularly the third and fourth MCPs, because clenched-fist injuries in this area breach extensor tendons and joint capsules, inoculate polymicrobial oral flora into relatively avascular synovial spaces, and allow rapid spread along tendon sheaths, producing septic arthritis and pyogenic tenosynovitis if not promptly recognized and treated [^114b3AHg] [^111qxQys] [^116Ddiid].

> Finally, I should confirm the clinical implications so we don't miss actionable steps. Early recognition, copious irrigation, careful exploration for tendon or joint violation, radiographs to assess for foreign body or fracture, early hand surgery consultation when deep structures are suspected, and empiric antibiotic coverage active against oral aerobes and anaerobes (for example, amoxicillin–clavulanate or an appropriate alternative) are essential to mitigate the high risk of infection at this location. Delayed presentation beyond 24 hours markedly worsens outcomes and should prompt a lower threshold for operative management [^114b3AHg] [^114aDtoo] [^112QDH35].

---

The most likely anatomical part to become infected after a human bite to the hand is the **dorsal metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint** [^notfound], especially over the third and fourth metacarpal heads, due to frequent extensor tendon and joint capsule violation from clenched-fist injuries [^1129uApQ]. Infection risk is high because the MCP joint is a relatively avascular synovial space [^notfound] that allows rapid bacterial proliferation and spread along tendon sheaths, often causing **pyogenic flexor tenosynovitis** or **septic arthritis** [^1169wgxC]. Early recognition, irrigation, debridement, and empiric antibiotics covering Eikenella, streptococci, staphylococci, and anaerobes are essential to prevent severe complications [^114aDtoo] [^111vVwiJ].

---

## Anatomical structures involved in human hand bites

Human hand bites commonly involve the following **anatomical structures**:

- **Skin and subcutaneous tissue**: The initial barrier breached by the bite, providing entry for bacteria [^115uMrnS].

- **Tendons and tendon sheaths**: Particularly the extensor tendons over the MCP joints, which are frequently injured in clenched-fist injuries [^114kxL9v].

- **Joint capsules**: Especially the MCP joints, which are commonly violated, allowing bacteria to enter the synovial space [^1129uApQ].

- **Bone**: Occasionally involved, leading to osteomyelitis in severe cases [^114kxL9v].

---

## Pathophysiology of infection in human hand bites

The pathophysiology of infection in human hand bites is influenced by several factors:

- **Bacterial inoculation**: Human saliva contains a high bacterial load, including aerobic and anaerobic organisms such as Streptococcus species, Staphylococcus aureus, Eikenella corrodens, Fusobacterium, and Prevotella species [^112pV4BS].

- **Tissue injury**: Bite wounds often cause significant soft tissue injury, creating devitalized tissue that serves as a nidus for infection [^112mVfHi].

- **Anatomical location**: The dorsal MCP joint region is particularly susceptible due to the relatively avascular synovial spaces and the frequent violation of extensor tendons and joint capsules [^1129uApQ].

---

## Specific anatomical location most likely to become infected

The **dorsal metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint** region, particularly over the third and fourth metacarpal heads, is the anatomical location most likely to become infected after a human bite to the hand. This area is commonly involved in clenched-fist injuries, where the extensor tendon and joint capsule are frequently violated, allowing bacteria to enter the synovial space [^114kxL9v]. The synovial space is relatively avascular, impairing immune response and antibiotic penetration, thereby facilitating rapid bacterial proliferation and spread along tendon sheaths [^1169wgxC].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting the MCP joint as the most susceptible site

Several clinical studies and case reports highlight the **MCP joint** as the most susceptible site for infection:

- **Clenched-fist injuries**: These injuries frequently involve the dorsal MCP joint, leading to extensor tendon injury, joint capsule violation, and subsequent infection [^1129uApQ].

- **Pyogenic flexor tenosynovitis**: Rapidly progressing infection of the flexor tendon sheath, often resulting from puncture wounds or bites involving the MCP joint region [^114b3AHg].

- **Septic arthritis**: Infection of the MCP joint is a common complication of human bites, necessitating prompt surgical intervention and antibiotic therapy [^111h8fiB].

---

## Microbiological factors contributing to infection

The microbiology of human hand bite infections is typically **polymicrobial**, involving both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria:

| **Bacterial species** | **Frequency of isolation** |
|-|-|
| Streptococcus species | 50% |
| Staphylococcus aureus | 40% |
| Eikenella corrodens | 30% |
| Fusobacterium species | 32% |
| Prevotella melaninogenica | 22% |

---

These bacteria are commonly found in human saliva and skin flora, and their presence in bite wounds significantly increases the risk of infection and complications [^111ECh8k] [^112pV4BS].

---

## Clinical implications and management strategies

Given the high risk of infection associated with human hand bites, particularly involving the MCP joint, **prompt and aggressive management** is essential:

- **Wound irrigation and debridement**: Thorough irrigation and debridement are critical to remove bacterial inoculum and devitalized tissue [^111vVwiJ].

- **Empiric antibiotic therapy**: Amoxicillin-clavulanate is recommended as first-line therapy due to its coverage of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, including Eikenella corrodens [^114aDtoo].

- **Surgical intervention**: Surgical exploration, irrigation, and debridement are often required, particularly in cases of suspected joint or tendon involvement [^111h8fiB].

- **Immobilization and elevation**: Immobilization of the hand and elevation of the affected limb help reduce swelling and promote healing [^114b3AHg].

---

## Potential complications if infection is not promptly treated

Failure to promptly treat infections resulting from human hand bites can lead to **severe complications**, including:

- **Pyogenic flexor tenosynovitis**: Rapidly progressing infection of the flexor tendon sheath, potentially leading to tendon necrosis and permanent hand dysfunction [^114b3AHg].

- **Septic arthritis**: Infection of the joint, causing joint destruction and chronic arthritis [^notfound].

- **Osteomyelitis**: Infection of the bone, requiring prolonged antibiotic therapy and surgical intervention [^notfound].

- **Permanent hand dysfunction**: Loss of hand function, chronic pain, and deformity due to extensive tissue destruction and scarring [^111h8fiB].

---

The **dorsal metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint** region, particularly over the third and fourth metacarpal heads, is the anatomical location most likely to become infected after a human bite to the hand. This is due to the frequent violation of extensor tendons and joint capsules, the relatively avascular synovial space, and the high bacterial load in human saliva. Prompt and aggressive management, including wound irrigation, debridement, empiric antibiotic therapy, and surgical intervention, is essential to prevent severe complications and preserve hand function [^111h8fiB].

Animal and human bite wounds — preemptive antimicrobial therapy and rabies prophylaxis: Preemptive early antimicrobial therapy for 3–5 days is recommended for patients who (a) are immunocompromised, (b) are asplenic, (c) have advanced liver disease, (d) have preexisting or resultant edema of the affected area, (e) have moderate to severe injuries, especially to the hand or face, or (f) have injuries that may have penetrated the periosteum or joint capsule (strong, low). Postexposure prophylaxis for rabies may be indicated; consultation with local health officials is recommended to determine if rabies prophylaxis should be initiated (strong, low). Numerous studies have failed to definitively determine who should receive early, preemptive therapy, so the decision to give "prophylactic" antibiotics should be based on wound severity and host immune competence. Prophylactic or early preemptive therapy seems to provide marginal benefit for patients with dog bites who present within 12–24 hours after injury, particularly in low-risk wounds. A meta-analysis of 8 randomized trials of dog bite wounds found a cumulative incidence of infection of 16%, with a relative risk of infection in patients treated with antibiotics compared with controls to be 0.56. Amoxicillin-clavulanate administered in one study to patients with full-thickness animal bites presenting > 9 hours after the bite resulted in a lower infection rate. A Cochrane review supported limiting prophylactic antibiotics in mammalian bites to hand injuries and human bites, but the 8 studies had limitations including small numbers (range, 12–190), failure to perform intention-to-treat analysis (4 of 8 studies), and unspecified method of randomization (4 of 8 studies).

Human bite wound infections — pathogens and diagnostic considerations note that The human oral cavity contains many potential aerobic and anaerobic pathogens and is the primary source of pathogens that cause infections following human bites. Relevant bacteria include Eikenella, S. aureus, group A Streptococcus, Fusobacterium, Peptostreptococcus, Prevotella, and Porphyromonas spp., in addition to human skin microbiota (staphylococci, streptococci), with other less common pathogens from the HACEK group (Aggregatibacter aphrophilus and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans; Capnocytophaga, Cardiobacterium, Eikenella, and Kingella spp.). Viral pathogens of importance include hepatitis B, hepatitis C, HIV, and HSV. For patients with clinically uninfected bite wounds, cultures are not indicated due to the lack of correlation with subsequent infection, whereas It is important that a Gram stain be performed on the specimen to assess the presence of indicators of inflammation (eg, neutrophils), superficial contamination (squamous epithelial cells).

Abstract

Background

Bite injuries are a common occurrence and may result in significant morbidity. The aim of the study was to investigate bite injuries, their treatment, and consequences in the urban milieu of a European industrialized nation.

Methods

A retrospective, monocentric analysis was conducted on data of bite injuries during the study period from 2010 to 2020. Factors such as age, sex, vaccination status, injury pattern, injury location, the duration of treatment in outpatient, inpatient, or intensive care settings were investigated together with radiological, laboratory, and microbiological parameters, as well as the therapies employed.

Results

The majority of the included 442 patients were between the ages of 20 and 50, with a mean age of 37.2 ± 18.4 years (0.7–91). The female sex was more frequently affected (59%). Most bite injuries were caused by dogs (49.9%), followed by cats (36.1%) and humans (9.8%) and were often caused by domestic animals (78%). The hand was the most common site of bites (n = 251), followed by the forearms (n = 75) and lower legs (n = 43). In children under the age of 10, the head was the most common site of bites. In only 5% of patients, injuries extended to deeper structures. Wound infection was observed in 14.7% of the bite wounds. The mean number of treatment days for patients with infected bite wounds was significantly higher than that for patients with non-infected wounds, regardless of whether they were outpatients, inpatients, or intensive care patients (p = 0.001, p < 0.001, and p = 0.003, respectively).

Conclusions

In accordance with the severity of the injury, a prompt examination, imaging, laboratory diagnostics, and individualized therapy are required. The implementation of an early therapeutic regimen comprising debridement and irrigation, calculated antibiotic therapy, and immobilization can effectively mitigate the risk of developing a fulminant wound infection. Similarly, bite wounds caused by exotic species are to be treated with haste and precision.

Level of evidence

Level III study: non-experimental descriptive studies.

### Antibiotic prophylaxis for mammalian bites [^1145Cuy8]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Bites by mammals are a common problem and they account for up to 1% of all visits to hospital emergency rooms. Dog and cat bites are the most common and people are usually bitten by their own pets or by an animal known to them. School-age children make up almost a half of those bitten. Prevention of tetanus, rabies and wound infection are the priorities for staff in emergency rooms. The use of antibiotics may be useful to reduce the risk of developing a wound infection.

Objectives

To determine if the use of prophylactic antibiotics in mammalian bites is effective in preventing bite wound infection.

Search Strategy

Relevant RCTs were identified by electronic searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register databases in November 2000.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials which studied patients with bites from all mammals. Comparisons were made between antibiotics and placebo or no intervention. The outcome of interest was the number of infections at the site of bite.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers extracted the data independently. All analyses were performed according to the intention-to-treat method.

Main Results

Eight studies were included. The use of prophylactic antibiotics was associated with a statistically significant reduction in the rate of infection after bites by humans. Prophylactic antibiotics did not appear to reduce the rate of infection after bites by cats or dogs. Wound type, e.g. laceration or puncture, did not appear to influence the effectiveness of the prophylactic antibiotic. Prophylactic antibiotics were associated with a statistically significant reduction in the rate of infection in hand bites (OR 0.10, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.86; NNT = 4, 95% CI 2 to 50).

Reviewer's Conclusions

There is evidence from one trial that prophylactic antibiotics reduces the risk of infection after human bites but confirmatory research is required. There is no evidence that the use of prophylactic antibiotics is effective for cat or dog bites. There is evidence that the use of antibiotic prophylactic after bites of the hand reduces infection but confirmatory research is required.

### Human bite and clenched-fist… [^1169wgxC]. AAFP (2003). Low credibility.

The pulp of the fingertip is divided into small compartments by 15 to 20 fibrous septa that run from the periosteum to the skin. Abscess formation in these relatively noncompliant compartments causes significant pain, and the resultant swelling can lead to tissue necrosis. Because the septa attach to the periosteum of the distal phalanx, spread of infection to the underlying bone can result in osteomyelitis.
16. The thumb flexor sheath begins at the terminal phalanx and extends to the volar wrist crease, where it communicates with the radial bursa. Anatomic variations are frequent. For example, the radial bursa can communicate with the ulnar bursa at the wrist. The synovial sheaths, poorly vascularized and rich in synovial fluid, provide an optimal environment for bacterial growth. Once inoculated, infection can spread rapidly within the confines of the sheath.

2 Infection of the flexor tendon sheath, known as pyogenic flexor tenosynovitis, warrants early surgical evaluation. 2–4, 14, 24 Patients with pyogenic flexor tenosynovitis present with the four cardinal signs as described by Kanavel: uniform, symmetric digit swelling; at rest, digit is held in partial flexion; excessive tenderness along the entire course of the flexor tendon sheath; and pain along the tendon sheath with passive digit extension. If there is no improvement within 12 to 24 hours, surgical intervention is warranted. Early surgical treatment should be considered if the patient is immunocompromised or has diabetes. Puncture wounds should be extended proximally and distally while the physician is looking for extensor tendon disruption or injury. The wound should be explored, copiously irrigated, and surgically debrided.

Material for Gram stain and aerobic/anaerobic cultures should be obtained from deep within all suppurative wounds before therapy is instituted. Gram stain results should guide initial antibiotic therapy. The wound should not be sutured but allowed to heal by secondary intention. The hand should be splinted in a position of function and elevated. Occupational rehabilitation can be considered once the infection has cleared.

Infections developing in damaged skin

Infections developing in damaged skin are a heterogeneous group including bite wounds (animal and human bites), pressure ulcers and burn wounds.

Bite wounds (animal and human bites)

Human bite microbiology generally includes Streptococcus spp, S. aureus, Peptostreptococcus spp, Fusobacterium spp and Eikinella spp.

Dog bite microbiology generally includes Pasteurella canis, Pasteurella multocida, Bacteroides spp, Fusobacterium spp, Capnocytophaga canimorsus and S. aureus.

Cat bite microbiology generally includes Pasteurella spp, Capnocytophaga spp, Bartonella henselae (Cat-scratch diseases should be treated with azithromycin 500 mg day 1, 250 mg/day for the next 4 days), S. aureus, Bacteroides spp and Fusobacterium spp.

If managed incorrectly, these infections can develop into more complicated SSTIs.

Treatment
Irrigation of the wound and debridement of necrotic tissue
Antibiotic prophylaxis as principle is not recommended. It is recommended in selected patients.
Antibiotic therapy in selected patients for 5 days. You may extend therapy up to 7–10 days if lack of symptom resolution at 5 days.
Tetanus prophylaxis in bite wounds

Irrigation of the wound and debridement of necrotic tissue are the most important factors in preventing infection and can substantially decrease the incidence of invasive wound infection. Primary wound closure is not recommended for wounds, with the exception of those to the face, which should be managed with copious irrigation, cautious debridement, and pre-emptive antibiotics.

The comprehensive meta-analyses of Medeiros et al. in the Cochrane Database demonstrated no evidential basis for reducing the infection rate by prophylactic antibiotics, except for selected cases. Despite the poor state of the evidence wounds that are moderate to severe, have associated crush injury, have associated edema (either preexisting or subsequent), that are on the hands or in proximity to a bone or a joint, or that are in compromised hosts should receive 3–5 days of antibiotic therapy.

A broad-spectrum antibiotic effective against aerobic and anaerobic organisms is required, if systemic signs of infection or severe cellulitis arise.

Human bites that have broken the skin and drawn blood can theoretically transmit hepatitis B, C, and HIV. A patient who has sustained a bite should always confirm that their tetanus booster is up to date.

Tetanus prophylaxis for animal bite wounds — Recommendation 43 — states that "Tetanus toxoid should be administered to patients without toxoid vaccination within 10 years. Tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis (TdaP) is preferred over Tetanus and diptheria (Td) if the former has not been previously given (strong, low)". The evidence summary emphasizes that "Tetanus is a severe and often fatal disease preventable through routine vaccination (ie, primary series and decennial boosters)".

### Anaphylaxis following a slow loris bite occurring in an area of forest fragmentation [^112nLiSy]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

Brachial gland exudate (BGE) is secreted in a gland located in the medial part of the loris upper arm (figure 6). Before the BGE is injected by the lorises' powerful tooth comb bite, the venom is believed to be mixed with their saliva. It is postulated that lorises access the exudate from their brachial gland by raising their hands before inflicting a bite, licking the BGE before mixing it with saliva in its mouth. It is unclear when this rarely observed step is carried out; diagnosis of envenomation is based on bite and symptoms alone. The function of slow loris venom in the natural context is not well understood; different theories on this have been hypothesised including ectoparasite defence, intraspecific antagonistic behaviours and both intraspecific and extraspecific communication.

Figure 6
A slow loris in the venom pose, arms raised to access licking the brachial glands. Original illustration by coauthor Alvi Muldani.

Some of the substances in the slow loris venom system (BGE plus saliva) have been identified, but how they function together to cause the clinical symptoms seen in humans is poorly understood. The BGE secretion protein (BGEsp) molecule is similar to a cat allergen protein (Fel-d-1). It is postulated that both BGEsp and Fel-d-1 may precipitate allergic reactions by mimicking lipocalins, an essential substance in the immune system. Another protein, a complement component called C1r, has been found in slow loris saliva, which may contribute to activation of the physiological responses leading to inflammation, swelling and anaphylaxis. Slow loris bite wounds in humans can become extremely painful and develop inflammation and paraesthesia (frequent initial symptoms)with festering, infected, slow-healing wounds that can progress to cellulitis.

### 2018 WSES / SIS-E consensus conference: recommendations for the management of skin and soft-tissue infections [^111ECh8k]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

What is the appropriate treatment of infections developing in damaged skin (burn wounds, animal and human bites, and pressure ulcers)?

Irrigation of the wound and debridement of necrotic tissue are the most important factors in the prevention of infection and can substantially decrease the incidence of invasive wound infection. Antibiotic prophylaxis is not generally recommended (recommendation 1C).

For patients with systemic signs of infection, compromised immune status, severe comorbidities, associated severe cellulitis, severe and deep wounds, a broad-spectrum antibiotic effective against aerobic, and anaerobic organisms is always required (recommendation 1C).

Infections developing in damaged skin are a heterogeneous group that includes bite wounds (animal and human bites), burn wounds, and pressure ulcers. If managed incorrectly, these infections can develop into more complicated soft-tissue infections.

Soft-tissue infection is the most common complication of animal and human bites. The risk of infection depends on the type of bite, the site of injury, the time elapsed from the bite until presentation, host factors, and the management of the wound. In general, 10–20% of bite wounds become infected, including 30–50% of cat bites, 5–25% of dog bites, and 20–25% of human bites, respectively.

The predominant pathogens in these wounds are part of the normal oral flora of the biting animal, along with human skin organisms and occasional secondary invaders (e.g. S. aureus and GAS). Along with Staphylococcus ssp. (including MRSA) and Streptococcus ssp. (including S. pyogenes), the commonly isolated pathogens include Pasteurella spp. (Pasteurella multocida, Pasteurella canis, Pasteurella dagmatis), Capnocytophagia canimorsus, anaerobes (Fusobacterium spp. Prevotella spp. Bacteroides spp. Porphyromonas spp.), and others. Streptococci can be isolated from 50% of human bite wounds, S. aureus from 40%, and Eikenella corrodens (a Gram-negative facultative anaerobic bacillus) from 30%. Human bites can transmit HBV, HCV, and HIV and post-exposure prophylaxis should be considered in every case.

### A blacktip reef shark bite to the hand in the remote Solomon Islands [^1132UunT]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Solomon Islands is a country in the South Pacific Ocean with excellent scuba diving, particularly among its remote islands that can be accessed by liveaboard dive boats. Blacktip reef sharks (Carcharhinus melanopterus) are found throughout the island nation and rarely attack humans.

Case Report

We present the case of a 42-year-old man who sustained a hand laceration after being bitten by a blacktip reef shark. He underwent complex primary wound closure in an austere environment and received prophylactic antibiotics. No infection developed and he recovered fully. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? We discuss our rationale in closing the wound aboard the dive boat, the choice of antibiotics, and review marine pathogens.

### The hand and wrist: antImicrobials and infection (HAWAII) trial [^116KeFfC]. The British Journal of Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

Hand trauma, comprising injuries to both the hand and wrist, affects over five million people per year in the NHS, resulting in 250 000 operations each year. Surgical site infection (SSI) following hand trauma surgery leads to significant morbidity. Triclosan-coated sutures may reduce SSI in major abdominal surgery but have never been tested in hand trauma. Feasibility needs to be ascertained before a definitive trial can be delivered in hand trauma.

Methods

A multicentre feasibility RCT of antimicrobial sutures versus standard sutures involving adults undergoing surgery for hand trauma to evaluate feasibility for a definitive trial. Secondary objectives were incidence of SSI in both groups, hand function measured with patient-reported outcome measures, health-related quality of life and change in employment. Randomization was performed on a 1:1 basis, stratified by age of the patient and whether the injury was open or closed, using a secure, centralized, online randomization service. Participants were blinded to allocation.

Results

116 participants were recruited and randomized (60 intervention, 56 control). Of 227 screened, most were eligible (89.5 per cent), and most who were approached agreed to be included in the study (84.7 per cent). Retention was low: 57.5 per cent at 30 days, 52 per cent at 90 days and 45.1 per cent at 6 months. Incidence of SSI was > 20 per cent in both groups. Hand function deteriorated after injury but recovered to near pre-injury levels during the study period.

Conclusions

Risk of SSI after hand trauma is high. A definitive RCT of antimicrobial sutures in hand trauma surgery is feasible, if retention is improved.

### Best evidence topic report. are antibiotics indicated following human bites? [^115uMrnS]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2005). Low credibility.

A short cut review was carried out to establish whether antibiotics are indicated for human bites. Eighty nine papers were found using the reported search, of which two represent the best evidence to answer the clinical question. The author, date and country of publication, patient group studied, study type, relevant outcomes, results, and study weaknesses of these best papers are tabulated. Prophylactic antibiotics should be given to all patients with human bites to the hands, feet, and skin overlying joints or cartilaginous structures, and to all patients with bites that penetrate deeper than the epidermal layer.

A retrospective review was performed on 111 patients who suffered either a dog or cat bite to the hand. Demographic data were collected for both the patient and the animal involved.

Results

The patient population had suffered 71 dog bites and 40 cat bites. Two scenarios were identified that increased the likelihood of a bite: (1) attempting to separate fighting animals and (2) attempting to aid an injured animal. More than half of the victims (61 of 111) were bitten by an animal with which they were familiar. Bite injuries ranged from relatively minor wounds to major injuries that included open fractures, persistent deep infection including osteomyelitis, nerve laceration, tendon laceration, or tissue loss. Approximately two thirds of patients required hospital admission at least for intravenous antibiotics. Approximately one third of animal bite victims required at least 1 surgical procedure. Thirteen patients required long-term intravenous antibiotics and/or multiple surgeries and incurred medical expenses in excess of dollar 77,000.

Conclusions

Domestic animal bites to the hand are common injuries that can produce considerable morbidity. Stray animals did not account for the majority of incidents. Bite prevention strategies should focus on careful handling of animals that are fighting or injured. Animal bite wounds often require intravenous antibiotics and hospitalization and the cost of care for deep infections can be enormous. Our patient population was selected from a small geographic area over a relatively short collection period, suggesting that domestic animal bite injuries may represent a major public health issue.

### Necrotizing infections of the hand and wrist: diagnosis and treatment options [^112N4H8u]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2020). Medium credibility.

Necrotizing infections of the hand and wrist are important clinical entities because of their rapidly progressive and potentially lethal nature. These infections encompass a spectrum of diseases with overlapping signs and symptoms, which can be subtle and nonspecific. If the brief prodromal period of these infections goes unrecognized, a local area of devitalized tissue can evolve into fulminant infection, multiorgan failure, and potentially death. Early recognition and treatment including administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics and surgical débridement are paramount to improving patient outcomes.

### Dog and cat bites: rapid evidence review [^112mVfHi]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

Animal bites are a significant burden to health care systems worldwide. In the United States, dog bites account for an average of 337,000 emergency visits and generate medical costs of up to $2 billion per year. Most animal bites in adults and children are from a dog, and most bite patients are children who have been bitten by animals known to them. Dog bites may cause crush and soft-tissue avulsion, whereas cat bites usually cause deeper puncture-type wounds. Children most often present with dog bites on the head and neck, and adolescents and adults usually present with dog bites on the extremities and hands. Bite wounds should be examined, cleaned, and irrigated with warm water or normal saline solution, and any foreign bodies and devitalized tissue should be removed. Neurovascular function (e.g., pulses, sensation) and range and movement of adjacent joints should be examined and documented. Antibiotic prophylaxis, with amoxicillin/clavulanate as the first-line choice, should be considered for all bites, particularly for those at increased risk of infection. Imaging and laboratory studies are usually not required unless there is suspicion of a retained foreign body, damage to underlying structures, infection, or extensive injury. Primary closure of bite wounds may be performed if there is low risk of infection. The need for tetanus vaccination and rabies postexposure prophylaxis should be evaluated for each patient; bites that do not break the skin generally do not require rabies postexposure prophylaxis.

### Bite injuries at a level 1 trauma center in Germany [^115cnaRz]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2025). Medium credibility.

Therapy and outcome

The treatment regimen included operative wound debridement in 15% of patients (n = 66), antibiotic therapy in 74% of patients (n = 327), and immobilization in 59% of patients (n = 260).

20 out of 442 patients had an injury to the deeper tissue structures. These included 12 bone injuries, 2 nerve injuries, 4 muscle injuries, 4 tendon injuries, 2 nail and nail bed injuries, 3 severe soft tissue injuries, and 1 cleft lip. Two patients with subtotal finger end phalanx amputation were also recorded.

It is fortunate to note that there were no documented deaths or amputations among the entire patient population. According to the available documentation, only two severe restrictions of movement were reported after hand injuries, including one patient with a proximal row carpectomy. Furthermore, five patients reported regional hypesthesia during the course of the disease, although it is unclear whether this was permanent.

### Orthopedic pitfalls in the ED: fight bite [^1129uApQ]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Clenched fist injuries to the mouth ("fight bite") are notorious for being the worst human bites. These are often treated as minor injuries, without the recognition that the joint capsule, the extensor tendon, or the deep fascial spaces may have been violated and contaminated with oral bacteria. Significant morbidity can result from late presentation or inadequate initial management. The emergency physician needs to remain vigilant for complications associated with closed fist injury. This review article examines the clinical presentation, diagnostic techniques, and management options applicable to the emergency physician in the treatment of fight bite.

### Common acute hand infections [^114kxL9v]. American Family Physician (2003). Low credibility.

Hand infections can result in significant morbidity if not appropriately diagnosed and treated. Host factors, location, and circumstances of the infection are important guides to initial treatment strategies. Many hand infections improve with early splinting, elevation, appropriate antibiotics and, if an abscess is present, incision and drainage. Tetanus prophylaxis is indicated in patients who have at-risk infections. Paronychia, an infection of the epidermis bordering the nail, commonly is precipitated by localized trauma. Treatment consists of incision and drainage, warm-water soaks and, sometimes, oral antibiotics. A felon is an abscess of the distal pulp of the fingertip. An early felon may be amenable to elevation, oral antibiotics, and warm water or saline soaks. A more advanced felon requires incision and drainage. Herpetic whitlow is a painful infection caused by the herpes simplex virus. Early treatment with oral antiviral agents may hasten healing. Pyogenic flexor tenosynovitis and clenched-fist injuries are more serious infections that often require surgical intervention. Pyogenic flexor tenosynovitis is an acute synovial space infection involving a flexor tendon sheath. Treatment consists of parenteral antibiotics and sheath irrigation. A clenched-fist injury usually is the result of an altercation and often involves injury to the extensor tendon, joint capsule, and bone. Wound exploration, copious irrigation, and appropriate antibiotics can prevent undesired outcomes.

### Cat bite infections of the hand: assessment of morbidity and predictors of severe infection [^111u23cW]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose

To assess the overall morbidity of cat bites to the hand and identify risk factors for hospitalization after such an injury.

Methods

All patients recently treated at our institution for cat bite injuries to the hand were retrospectively reviewed. We identified 193 patients in a 3-year period between January 1, 2009, and December 31, 2011. Patient demographics, medical history, physical examination findings, laboratory values, and long-term follow-up data were collected. Univariate and multivariate statistical regression were used to analyze the data.

Results

Thirty percent (n = 57) of patients with cat bites to the hand were hospitalized. The average length of stay for these patients was 3.2 days. Of the hospitalized patients, 67% (n = 38) underwent irrigation and debridement, with 8 patients requiring more than 1 operation. Complications were common among these patients. Risk factors associated with hospitalization included smoking, immunocompromised state, and location of bite over a joint or tendon sheath. Physical examination findings of erythema and swelling at presentation were also associated with increased risk of hospitalization. Time from bite to presentation, white blood cell count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and C-reactive protein values at presentation were not associated with hospitalization.

Conclusions

Cat bite injuries to the hand can progress to serious infection. The treatment of such infections often requires hospitalization, intravenous antibiotic therapy, and operative treatment. Clinical findings suggestive of the need for hospitalization include location of the bite over a joint or tendon sheath, erythema, pain, and swelling. These findings should increase concern for a severe infection and warrant hospitalization and urgent consultation with a hand surgeon.

### A human bite on the scrotum: case report and review of management in the emergency department [^113k9SJe]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Human bites involving the genitalia rarely present to the emergency department (ED). They have the potential to cause life-threatening secondary infections as well as serious physical and functional damage.

Case Report

We report a case of an adult male who sustained a human bite to the scrotum, resulting in a ragged laceration on the anterior scrotum, with a devascularized flap and necrotic edges overlying the wound. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Human bites to the scrotum are rare and, hence, the experience of emergency physicians treating patients presenting with these injuries may be minimal. This puts patients at risk of underevaluation or suboptimal treatment. The rapid initiation of antibiotics in the ED and thorough wound debridement will prevent infections, aid healing, and lead to improved outcomes by preserving organ function and integrity. We therefore present a systematic approach to the management of patients with human bite to the scrotum in the ED.

### Prospective audit of 106 consecutive human bite injuries: the importance of history taking [^1169ajf4]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2005). Low credibility.

Objectives

Some patients attempt to conceal human bites with factitious mechanisms of injury. Follow up questioning allows patients to modify their histories. This practice was prospectively audited.

Methods

Patients with cutaneous wounds who did not present with a history of human bite were asked a follow up question. Those who then gave a history of human bite were noted.

Results

Certain groups of patients with human bites were significantly more likely to provide a factitious history and/or delay presentation.

Conclusion

Follow up questioning dramatically increased the case-detection rate, prompting specific management.

### Fingertip infections [^117RpAtH]. The Orthopedic Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

The fingertip is the interface between humans and the world, including the various thorns, dirty needles, and other hazards to be found there. It is unsurprising that this is the site where hand infections most frequently occur. Although commonly encountered by hand surgeons and other physicians, fingertip infections have several mimics, and diagnosis and management is not always straightforward. Early diagnosis and treatment are key to success. As with all infections, they are more common and are more aggressive in immunosuppressed patients. This article reviews fingertip anatomy, common and uncommon fingertip infections and their mimics, and recommendations for management.

### Antibiotic prophylaxis in injury: an American Association for the Surgery of Trauma critical care committee clinical consensus document [^1114uf3X]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2024). Medium credibility.

While the literature is inconclusive for low-energy wounds, there is support for prophylactic antibiotic usage when wounds are complex, are of higher energy, have anatomic location such as hands/feet, and/or have other high-risk features mentioned above. Higher energy GSWs are associated with increased infection rates, at least in part because the increased mass of devitalized tissue creates an excellent medium for bacterial growth without full host defenses. For high-energy wounds, 24–72 hours of systemic antibiotics have been recommended. However, previous studies have indicated that only in a fraction of cases could the type of weapon be accurately determined, so ultimately most of these judgments must rely on examination of the wound. This led to the axiom to treat 'the wound and not the weapon' from Lindsey. Even if the degree of tissue contamination and tissue destruction merit antibiotic prophylaxis, antibiotics alone, without adequate debridement, would be insufficient. When antibiotic prophylaxis is determined necessary for lower energy GSWs, a first-generation cephalosporin (or clindamycin in the setting of a penicillin allergy) generally is sufficient. Appropriate duration is unclear and likely needs to be determined based on the same considerations described above. Tetanus vaccination status should be addressed.

### Human bites in children… [^113bhzfd]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Three hundred twenty-two human bites in children, occurring during a six-year period, were reviewed. The majority occurred during warm-weather months between 2 pm and 11 pm. The upper extremities, face and neck, and trunk were most commonly bitten. At the time of injury, children were most often engaged in fights or play. Seventy-five percent of wounds were superficial abrasions, 13% were punctures, and 11% were lacerations. None of the 242 abrasions became infected as opposed to 38% of the punctures and 37% of the lacerations. Other factors associated with increased risk of infection were delay in initial physician assessment beyond 18 hours after injury, location of the bite on the upper extremities, and occurrence of injury during sports activities. Prophylactic use of penicillin was probably not effective in reducing infection rates in these children; however, prospective data are needed to properly address this issue.

### Watch out for wild animals: a systematic review of upper extremity injuries caused by uncommon species [^111KHtuf]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Across the world, many species of nondomesticated animals dwell among humans in metropolitan areas. Rare animal bites pose a dilemma for hand surgeons, as they often result in operative injuries and recalcitrant infections. The authors treated an 85-year-old man who experienced severe cellulitis of the index finger following an opossum bite. This case prompted a systematic review of upper extremity injuries caused by species other than dogs, cats, snakes, and insects.

Methods

The authors conducted a systematic review of PubMed and Scopus databases to identify relevant articles published between 1980 and 2016. Two reviewers critically appraised the studies that met inclusion and exclusion criteria.

Results

The hand infection in the man who sustained an opossum bite at the authors' institution was successfully treated with targeted antibiotic therapy, hand elevation, and splinting. Seventy-one articles met inclusion criteria for and were included in this systematic review. The vast majority of existing articles represent level IV and level V evidence. The relevant literature suggests that the majority of hand infections attributable to animal bites and stings are polymicrobial.

Conclusions

Injuries secondary to aquatic animals appear to be the most frequently described in the literature, and hot water immersion should be used for the majority of envenomation attributable to aquatic species. Infections can often be treated with an aminopenicillin antibiotic combined with a beta-lactamase inhibitor. Given the variability in presentation and potential for sequelae such as soft-tissue necrosis and systemic reactions, hand surgeons should approach such upper extremity injuries with a high degree of caution.

### Bite injuries at a level 1 trauma center in Germany [^114VgefK]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2025). Medium credibility.

Medical advice for first treatment

Treatment recommendations for bite wounds:

Immediate presentation and treatment of the bite wound.
Debridement and irrigation with isotonic electrolyte solution.
X-ray to exclude fractures or foreign bodies.
Preferably open wound treatment, but loose-fitting sutures for large defects.
Immobilization in a plaster cast or splint.
If the epidermis is not intact, general broad-spectrum antibiotics.
Consider tetanus vaccination.
Consider rabies vaccination if travel history or risk area is positive.
Contact the poison control center in case of venomous snakebite and obtain antidote if necessary.
Medical wound check via general practitioner.

If the bite wound is infected:

Early surgical treatment of hand or foot phlegmons.
Thorough surgical debridement.
Second-look surgery for severe findings.
Cast immobilization.
Intravenous broad-spectrum antibiotics and later adjustment to the resistogram.
Laboratory tests need not be abnormal.
Daily medical check-ups until infection-free, conducted by hospital doctors or general practitioners.
Occupational therapy and physiotherapy for hand phlegmon after the infection has subsided.

### Hand infections in the immunocompromised patient: an update [^113mUk85]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Physicians are increasingly caring for immunocompromised individuals owing, in part, to the improved treatments and the increased life expectancy in these patients. Presentation of a patient with hand infection can vary greatly depending on the patient's underlying immune status. It is important to recognize and treat the infections quickly and effectively owing to the higher morbidity and mortality that may result from ineffective or delayed treatment in this patient population. The purpose of this article is to provide an outline of the most common and some of the more exotic organisms causing hand infections in patients with human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, diabetes, and patients on immunosuppressive treatment. We discuss presentation, clinical picture, evidence-based approaches in treatment, and possible complications. It is important to inform surgeons of the atypical presentation of hand infections and systemic infections with hand manifestation in immunocompromised patients in order to shorten time to accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.

### Surgical infections of the hand and upper extremity: a county hospital experience [^117BT4T5]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2002). Low credibility.

Between January 1992 and June 1995, 443 patients underwent surgical treatment for infections of the hand and upper extremity at Cook County Hospital. Most admissions were for human bites (51%). Other causes included cellulitis (17.0%), septic arthritis (11.8%), abscess formation (9.9%), gangrene (2.7%), flexor tenosynovitis (2.5%), osteomyelitis (1.8%), dog bites (1.4%), web space infections (0.9%), paronychia (0.45%), and cat bites (0.23%). Bacterial cultures were obtained in 395 cases; sensitivities were obtained in 247 of the cultures. Cultures grew a total of 719 organisms. By far, the most common organisms isolated were Gram-positive aerobes (61.9%), including streptococcal species (29.5%), Staphylococcus aureus (15.3%), and coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (11.5%). Most of the organisms isolated were common flora of the mouth or skin. Cultures reflected an increased incidence of Gram-negative enteric and anaerobic organisms compared with similar studies in the literature. Bacterial sensitivities reflected increased organism virulence compared with similar studies in the literature. Bacteria were resistant to the first-line antibiotic therapy of penicillin G (2–4 million units every 4–6 hours) and cefazolin (1 g every 8 hours) in 16.2% of cultures. The predominant resistant organism was Staphylococcus aureus, which grew resistant strains in 19.6% of cultures tested. Enterococcus grew resistant strains to the first-line regimen in 47%. The Enterobacteriaceae grew resistant strains to the first-line regimen in 66.6%. Acinetobacter grew resistant strains to the first-line regimen in 92%. Pseudomonas grew resistant strains to the first-line regimen in 100%. The addition of gentamicin (5 mg/kg every morning) in cases of suspected intravenous drug abuse did not significantly alter the results. Sensitivity results were also analyzed to determine the effectiveness of specific antibiotics against the prevalent resistant organisms. Vancomycin (1 g every 12 hours) proved most effective against the Gram-positive organisms. Ciprofloxacin (400 mg every 12 hours) proved most effective against the Gram-negative organisms, including Pseudomonas, and was also the most effective single agent overall.

### Acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans: clinical and microbiological characteristics of a cohort of 693 Slovenian patients [^1171Gukh]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Our study shows that, as for EM, ACA is more common on the lower extremity than on the upper extremity. The fact that EM develops at the site of a tick bite, and that tick bites in adults are more common on the lower than on the upper part of the body, implies localized illness at the site of tick bite not only for EM but also for ACA.

It is not known why patients with ACA are mostly older, why women are more commonly affected than men, and why the distal parts of the limbs are mainly involved. However, female predominance is not a complete surprise; as in several European countries, including Slovenia, LB is more common in women than in men. Closer insight shows that female predominance is valid only for cutaneous manifestations of LB (EM and ACA, which are by far the most common clinical signs and account for ≥ 90% of all LB cases in Slovenia), but not for Lyme neuroborreliosis and Lyme arthritis, which are more common in males. A recent hypothesis suggests that ACA occurs in older individuals because they are likely to have age‐related anatomic/physiological skin changes in the distal extremities that may predispose to the development of ACA in those particular body parts. However, if this were the case, why do later similar lesions also appear on the distal part of some other limb and why does this happen contralaterally more often than ipsilaterally, resulting in bilateral, more or less symmetrical lesions that are more often present on hands than on feet? A possible theoretical explanation is that the initial localized infection disseminates early on, before the humoral immune response. Consequently, borreliae are present in other parts of the body as early as during the initial infection, but manifest as clinically visible primary ACA after a longer delay because the skin in these areas is less damaged than at the primary location. Alternative hypotheses are that borreliae spread slowly and continuously from the site of primary infection through the skin or along nerves to other parts of the body, or that despite a pronounced humoral immune response intermittent haematogenous dissemination of borreliae occurs in the course of ACA; in both cases, the infection becomes clinically evident on locations with the most 'favourable' conditions for ACA. A further possibility would be reinfection, that is new localized infection at the 'vulnerable' site with a long delay until clinical manifestation. However, all these hypotheses are only partial explanations and have several weaknesses.

### SARS-CoV-2 on the ocular surface: is it truly a novel transmission route? [^114u5NnB]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2021). Medium credibility.

IS SARS-COV-2 TRANSMITTED AND INFECTED THROUGH THE OCULAR SURFACE?

Respiratory viruses cause a broad spectrum of diseases in humans, including several ocular tropisms. The main reason is that infectious droplets and body ﬂuids easily contaminate the human conjunctival epithelium. Notably, hand–eye contact may increase the risk of contracting the virus from the hand. Therefore, we analysed the probability of an ocular transmission route.

Link between the ocular and respiratory systems

Several anatomical properties indicate the eye as a potential site of virus infection and a gateway for respiratory infection. The nasolacrimal system provides a significant anatomical bridge between the ocular and respiratory systems. Based on this bridge, tear fluid from the ocular surface is transported to the inferior meatus of the nose, which facilitates viral movement from the ocular surface to the respiratory tract. The ocular mucosal immune system and nasolacrimal ducts further share immunological interdependence. As previously reviewed, beyond the anatomical relationship between the ocular and respiratory systems, the structure and distribution of the cellular receptors in these systems likely contribute to the tissue tropism of respiratory viruses, such as when host epithelial cell glycoproteins bearing terminal sialic acids are distributed throughout the human respiratory tract and ocular tissue. These factors indicate that other ocular discharges containing the virus may drain to the respiratory tract through the lacrimal passage and cause the patient to become infected with pneumonia. Qing et al discussed that the virus entered the tears through droplets that may pass through the nasolacrimal ducts and into the respiratory tract. Despite intensive work focused on understanding the relationship between the ocular and respiratory systems, further research is needed to better understand the relationship between ocular and respiratory manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

### Soft tissue infection of immunocompetent man with cat-derived globicatella species [^112jowuP]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Cats are major reservoirs of zoonotic infections. Their long, sharp teeth predispose to deep-tissue bite injuries, and direct inoculation of feline saliva gives high risk for secondary infection. Infecting pathogens usually reflect colonizing oral microbiota; Pasteurella and Streptococcus species are the most common. Bacteria of the genus Globicatella are small, gram-positive cocci that resemble viridans-group streptococci. Globicatella sanguinis is the only known species to cause human infection, having been implicated in small numbers of bloodstream, heart, central nervous system and urinary tract infections. G. sulfidifaciens is the only other known Globicatella species, but human infection has not been described. We report a novel Globicatella species causing extensive soft tissue infection and tenosynovitis in an immunocompetent man after cat bite injuries.

A 48-year-old obese man came to the emergency department in 2020 because of painful bilateral hand swelling, 8 hours after sustaining several bites from a single feral cat. He had multiple puncture wounds and abrasions, without evidence of surrounding cellulitis. His wounds were bathed in povidone‒iodine solution and dressed, and a booster dose of tetanus vaccine was administered. He was discharged and given oral doxycycline, ciprofloxacin, and metronidazole treatment because of history of penicillin allergy. He returned to the emergency department 24 hours later because of evolving flexor sheath infection in his left little and right middle fingers and cellulitis of both forearms (Figure). He was given intravenous vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, and metronidazole, then underwent debridement and washout. He was given 5 days of oral doxycycline and metronidazole postoperatively and made a full recovery. The patient provided fully informed, written consent for this case to be published, with accompanying clinical photographs.

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of skin and soft tissue infections: 2014 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^111uLr8V]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Medium credibility.

Infected animal bite–related wounds — treatment recommendations and options: An antimicrobial agent or agents active against both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria such as amoxicillin-clavulanate (Table 5) should be used (strong, moderate). Purulent bite wounds and abscesses are more likely to be polymicrobial, whereas nonpurulent wounds commonly yield staphylococci and streptococci, and Pasteurella species are commonly isolated from both nonpurulent wounds with or without lymphangitis and from abscesses; nonpurulent wound infections may also be polymicrobial. Based on this bacteriology, amoxicillin-clavulanate is appropriate oral therapy that covers the most likely aerobes and anaerobes found in bite wounds. Alternative therapies could include second-generation cephalosporins (intravenously [IV] or by mouth [po]) (eg, cefuroxime), other second- or third-generation cephalosporins, plus anaerobic coverage (clindamycin or metronidazole) if required; a carbapenem, moxifloxacin, or doxycycline is also appropriate. If SMX-TMP or levofloxacin is used, anaerobic coverage with either clindamycin or metronidazole should be added. Unless no alternative agents are available, macrolides should be avoided due to variable activity against Pasteurella multocida and fusobacteria. Pregnancy is a relative contraindication for use of tetracyclines and fluoroquinolones, whereas SMX-TMP may be safely prescribed except in the third trimester of pregnancy.

### Caiman bite [^116t7nsM]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Caiman crocodilus, commonly called the spectacled caiman, is a very widely distributed resident of the western-hemisphere wetlands. Caiman bites to humans can cause trauma and infection. There are few reports of caiman bites; however, there is information about bites by other members of the same family, including Alligator mississippiensis. A case of acute caiman bite to the hand is described, including initial treatment and outcome. The bite resulted in multiple lacerations, interarticular fracture, and infection. One of the lacerations was closed, and the patient was started on moxifloxacin hydrochloride. Preventive care and treatment including wound care and antibiotics are discussed. The patient recovered with only a slight long-term functional deficit.

### "Fight-bite": not just a hand problem [^1122d6AU]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2014). Low credibility.

Human bite wounds around the knee are rarely seen, yet may require the same urgent attention as a fight bite to the hand. Two cases of polymicrobial septic arthritis of the knee secondary to a human bite wound are described. In both the cases, the diagnosis of the septic arthritis was delayed because the intra-articular wound was unrecognized. The injuries were initially deemed superficial and managed with local wound care. In each case, the knee was flexed at the time of injury and the quadriceps tendon was penetrated by a tooth which inoculated the knee joint. Septic arthritis of the knee presented, in both cases, 72 hours after the injury. These infections proved challenging to treat and required multiple surgeries and prolonged antibiotic therapy. The "fight bite" phenomenon of the hand is widely recognized and the same phenomenon can occur at the knee.

### Management of human bites in a rural Kenyan setting: a plastic surgeon's 8-year experience [^112CMkYR]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The treatment of human bites is a common issue facing healthcare practitioners in the developing countries of Sub-Saharan Africa where it has been noted as a growing public health concern. Generally, the desired outcomes from surgical management are healing, function, and aesthetics. We share our 8-year experience at Kapsowar Hospital in Kenya with the presentation, management, and outcome of human bites. We are uniquely situated to do so given the prevalence of human biting in our community and the full-time presence of a plastic surgeon at our institution. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to present human bite surgical management by a plastic surgeon certified by the American Board of Surgery working full-time on the African continent.

Methods

A retrospective chart review was conducted on all patients who presented to the operating theater at Kapsowar Hospital with a human bite between 2013–2021. After identification of eligible patients, charts were reviewed assessing parameters including age, gender, timing from injury to presentation at hospital, localization of bite, severity of facial wounds using Lackmann's classification, surgical procedure(s), postoperative complications, surgical revisions, antibiotics administered, and circumstance of incident. Data were analyzed using SPSS 29.0.0.0.

Results

Forty-four patients were identified. Seventeen (38.6%) were female and 27 (61.4%) were male. Thirty-one patients had facial bites and 13 patients had bites to other parts of the body. Of facial bites, 70.3% resulted in amputation of the affected part while 29.7% were lacerations. Using Lackmann's classification for facial bite severity, IIIA bites (complete avulsion) were most common for both males (9) and females (7). Females comprised 68.4% of total lip bite victims. Bites to the extremity were associated with late presentation and infection. We report a salvage rate of 85.7% for infected digits.

Conclusions

Compared with most other studies on human bites, our patient population presents with a higher rate of avulsive lip injuries, most commonly among women. Our postoperative infection rate is lower than many others reported in the literature. Satisfactory cosmetic outcome with low risk of infection can be achieved by following well-established principles of wound healing and tension-free closure.

### Epidemiology of adult acute hand infections at an urban medical center [^111p8Zdc]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose

To define the current epidemiology of adult acute hand infections in an urban setting, with the aim of helping to improve empiric treatment, as hand infections represent a major source of morbidity and can result in stiffness and, possibly, amputation.

Methods

We performed an electronic medical record search to identify all patients admitted to our urban academic medical center with diagnoses related to open wounds and infections in the hand and fingers over a 6-year period (2005–2010). We recorded demographic data, location of infection, medical comorbidities, and culture data.

Results

Of the 2,287 patients admitted with diagnoses related to open wounds and infections in the hand and fingers, 1,507 incision and drainage procedures were performed, which resulted in 458 patients (30%) with culture-positive infections. Wound cultures identified 39 different species of bacteria. Most of these were methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, which compromised 53% of positive cultures, followed by methicillin-sensitive S aureus in 23% of positive cultures. The cultures were polymicrobial in 19%. History of intravenous drug use or diabetes mellitus was a strong predictor of polymicrobial infection.

Conclusions

Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus was the most common bacteria cultured from these infections. Empiric antibiotic coverage should routinely cover methicillin-resistant S aureus. We noted a higher incidence of polymicrobial infections than previously reported, particularly with intravenous drug use, diabetes, and human bites. Volar hand infections had the highest percentage of positive cultures, whereas paronychia had the lowest percentage.

Facial and scalp lacerations

Are prophylactic antibiotics indicated in the setting of facial and scalp lacerations?

Recommendations: Prophylactic antibiotics should be given for through-and-through lacerations from the skin to the oral cavity and in the setting of mammalian bites to the face. Prophylactic antibiotics should not be routinely prescribed for simple facial and scalp lacerations; however, 24 hours or less should be considered in cases with higher infection risk: wounds with significant tissue destruction, large dead space, extensive contamination, or patients with underlying medical problems that increase their risk of infection (table 2).

Discussion: Caruso et al wrote a detailed review of the evidence for prophylactic antibiotic therapy in traumatic craniomaxillofacial injuries in 2022, nicely summarizing the available literature. Much of this discussion will draw from that review, as well as the Infectious Disease Society of America guidelines. There is a general lack of adequate evidence to guide decision-making for these injuries, and Caruso et al appropriately counsel that thoughtful consideration of the patient, wound, and underlying pathophysiology must be used to make decisions when there is no clear guidance from the data. Compared with injuries to the rest of the body, injuries to the head and neck tend to have the lowest rates of infectious complications. This is likely due to the excellent blood supply to this region of the body. For clinical scenarios of 'normal' risk (a simple wound in a healthy patient), prophylactic antibiotics do not confer a benefit and should not be used. However, wound characteristics (bites, farming injuries, crush injuries, gross contamination, devitalized tissue, etc) and patient characteristics (diabetes, immunosuppression, steroids, extremes of age, obesity, etc) need to be factored into an assessment of overall infection risk.

### A 4-year review of human bite injuries presenting to emergency medicine and proposed evidence-based guidelines [^1169mWXG]. Injury (2009). Low credibility.

Human bite injuries are a common injury, roughly accounting for around 0.1% of attendances to Emergency Medicine departments. Morbidities associated with such injuries are legion. Of paramount importance is the potential for infection of the wound site, both bacterial and viral. A retrospective 4-year review of 3136 case notes was conducted, identifying 421 human bites. This amounts to one every 3 days! The majority of those bitten were young males (male:female ratio = 3:1; 44% comprising the age group 16–25 years). The management of these wounds was found to be poor. 17% of patients did not receive any antibiotic cover; 21% of patients either did not have tetanus prophylaxis administered when required or had a tetanus booster when they were already covered; 34% of patients either did not receive a hepatitis B booster when one was required or received one when they were already covered. This lack of effective documentation, along with errors in addressing prophylaxis of the infective agents, may have profound medico-legal consequences. The author believes that the findings will be reproduced in other centres and in view of the inadequacies highlighted by this work, it is necessary to introduce an evidence-based protocol for the comprehensive management of the human bite. Using United Kingdom Department of Health evidence-based guidelines, the author proposes such a pathway.

### Evidence-based emergency medicine / critically appraised topic. the role of antibiotic prophylaxis for prevention of infection in patients with simple hand lacerations [^116nw7Yr]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Study Objective

The use of prophylactic antibiotics in patients with simple hand lacerations is controversial. This evidence-based emergency medicine review evaluates the existing evidence about the utility of prophylactic systemic antibiotics for prevention of infection in patients with simple hand lacerations.

Methods

MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, and other databases were searched. Studies were selected for possible inclusion in the review if the authors stated that they had randomly assigned patients to an antibiotic treatment group or a control group and if they followed them up for the occurrence of infection. They also had to describe a reasonable method of wound cleaning for all subjects, repair the wounds, and exclude hand lacerations that involved special tissues such as bone, tendons, nerves, or large vessels. Standard criteria to appraise the quality of published trials were used.

Results

Four randomized trials met the inclusion criteria, of which 3 met minimally acceptable quality standards. Relative risks of infection after antibiotic use were 1.05 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.09 to 11.38), 0.73 (95% CI 0.37 to 1.46), and 1.07 (95% CI 0.07 to 16.80) for the 3 included studies. In these trials, the differences in infection rates between antibiotic and control groups failed to reach statistical significance.

Conclusion

No convincing trend toward either benefit or harm from administration of antibiotics for uncomplicated hand lacerations is apparent. Clinical judgment based on individual cases should be used in such settings.

### Presentation and management of human lip bites at a Kenyan center: a case series [^116EmmEy]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose

To describe the pattern of presentation and management of human lip bites.

Patients and Methods

Data on patients who presented with human lip bites between 2005 and 2007 were recorded.

Results

There were 6 men and 4 women whose ages ranged from 25 to 60 years with varying degrees of lip loss that occurred in different circumstances. Reconstruction using local flaps was carried out in various stages to achieve satisfactory esthetic and functional outcomes.

Conclusions

Human lip bites can be repaired at any time of presentation using local flaps with acceptable results. Wound infection is not a major issue following these injuries.

### A skin organoid-based infection platform identifies an inhibitor specific for HFMD [^112RREmW]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Enterovirus 71 (EV-A71) is a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus belonging to the Enterovirus genus of the Picornaviridae family. EV-A71 is a major pathogen of hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) and mainly affects infants and young children mostly ≤ 5 years of age. EV-A71 is primarily transmitted via the fecal-oral route. The virus enters the human body through contact with contaminated feces or hands, and the gastrointestinal tract has been identified as the primary target of infection. The most common clinical symptoms of EV-A71 infection are low-grade fever with discomfort, macular papules or blisters on the skin of hands, feet, and buttocks, and painful ulcerative lesions in the throat, mouth, and tongue. Although the virus is easily cultured from skin vesicles and oral secretions, the replication site and pathogenesis of EV-A71 in human skin remain unknown. In addition, EV-A71 is a highly neurotropic virus, and the central nervous system (CNS) is also an important target for EV-A71 infection. Following EV-A71 infection of the CNS, inflammation can occur in different anatomical regions or simultaneously in multiple regions, causing encephalitis, meningitis, neurogenic pulmonary edema, and acute flaccid paralysis. Thus, timely identification and treatment of EV-A71 infections is important.

### Low risk of infection in selected human bites treated without antibiotics [^113zD73b]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

To assess the need for antibiotics in low-risk human bite wounds, a prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled study involving 127 patients presenting with low-risk human bite wounds over 2 years to a 40,000 visit per year major academic ED was performed. Low-risk bites penetrated only the epidermis and did not involve hands, feet, skin, overlying joints, or cartilaginous structures. Exclusion criteria included age less than 18 years, puncture wounds, immunocompromise, allergy to penicillin or related compound, or bites greater than 24 hours old. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either a cephalexin/penicillin combination or placebo. One hundred twenty-five patients completed the study. Infection developed in 1 of 62 patients receiving placebo (1.6%, 95% confidence interval CI, 0–7.3%). Infection developed in 0 of 63 patients receiving the cephalexin/penicillin combination (0%, 95% CI, 0–4.6%). Antibiotic treatment of some low-risk human bite wound could be unnecessary. Infection rates appear similar in low-risk human bite wounds whether treated with antibiotics or placebo.

### Bite injuries at a level 1 trauma center in Germany [^112uNnPP]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2025). Medium credibility.

Patients and methods

The study design of this investigation on animal and human bite injuries is retrospective and monocentric, conducted at a level 1 trauma center in Germany. The data set encompasses all patients presenting with bite wounds at the clinic during a 10-year period, from January 2010 to January 2020.

Epidemiological data were collected, including information pertaining to the demographic characteristics of the subjects. The anatomic region of the bite was examined to identify the parts of the body most vulnerable to injury. In the case of animal bites, the species was assessed, distinguishing between domestic and wild animals. It was also recorded whether the patient presenting with the injury was also the owner of the animal. Snakebites were classified as either venomous or constricting. Furthermore, it was established whether the rabies vaccination status of the animal was known. Additionally, it was documented whether the bite occurred at the site of contact or during a long-distance journey to an area with elevated risk. To ascertain whether there were any seasonal differences, the month in which the bite occurred was documented.

In the case of human bite wounds, the documented infection status regarding HIV or hepatitis infection was analyzed. The investigation also sought to ascertain whether the injuries had occurred during physical altercations, unintentional sexual incidents, or when treating psychiatric or neurological patients.

The efficacy of preclinical first aid, including that provided by the rescue service, and in-hospital care was evaluated. Furthermore, the current study sought to ascertain the infection rate associated with bite injuries. The clinical diagnosis of a superinfection of the bite wound was made, incorporating the following criteria: increasing redness, transmission of pain along the tendons, pronounced edema formation, pus, fever, chills, tachycardia, and hypotension. Indications of an infection may also be indicated by increased laboratory chemical values, for example, leukocyte count, C-reactive protein (CRP), and procalcitonin. However, in patients with acute infection of the fingers, toes, hands or feet, these values may not necessarily be elevated.

### Managing parrot bite injuries to the hand: not just another animal bite [^115hFpWJ]. Hand (2015). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Bites and scratches are common injuries, frequently sustained from humans, dogs and cats. Exotic pet-related harm however is an important and increasingly emerging class of injury. Whilst the principles of prompt and thorough medical assessment, antibiotics and potential surgical washout and debridement apply, exotic pet wounds require further consideration. Standard antibiotic prophylaxis with amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (also known as co-amoxiclav) is not sufficient for the pathogens transmitted by parrot bites. We illustrate the importance of adequate consideration of microbiological pathogens with a case report of an open finger fracture resulting from a parrot bite. We intend this to be a valuable resource for healthcare professionals in their effective management of such injuries.

### Hand infections: anatomy, types and spread of infection, imaging findings, and treatment options [^116Ddiid]. Radiographics (2014). Low credibility.

Infections of the hand are common, particularly in immunocompromised patients, and can lead to significant morbidity, including amputation, if not treated properly. Hand infection can spread far and wide from the original site of inoculation through interconnections between the synovium-lined and nonsynovial potential spaces. Because surgery is the mainstay of treatment, knowledge of the pertinent anatomy is imperative for accurately describing the presence, location, and extent of infection. The authors review the pertinent anatomy of the spaces of the hand and describe different types of infection-including cellulitis, necrotizing fasciitis, paronychia, felon, pyogenic flexor tenosynovitis, deep space infections, septic arthritis, and osteomyelitis-and common causative organisms of these infections. They also describe various modes of spread; the common radiologic appearances of hand infections, with emphasis on findings at magnetic resonance imaging and ultrasonography; and the role of radiology in the management of these infections, along with a brief overview of treatment options.

### Bites (mammalian) [^1112RfdJ]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2010). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Mammalian bites are usually caused by dogs, cats, or humans, and are more prevalent in children (especially boys) than in adults. Animal bites are usually caused by the person's pet and, in children, frequently involve the face. Human bites tend to occur in children as a result of playing or fighting, while in adults they are usually the result of physical or sexual abuse. Mixed aerobe and anaerobe infection is the most common type of infection, and can occur in up to half of human bites.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of interventions to prevent complications of mammalian bites? What are the effects of treatments for infected mammalian bites? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to October 2009 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found five systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: antibiotic prophylaxis (human bites, non-human bites), antibiotics, debridement, decontamination, irrigation, primary wound closure, and tetanus vaccination (after mammalian bites).

### Acute hand infections [^114b3AHg]. American Family Physician (2019). Medium credibility.

Acute hand infections are often caused by puncture wounds and are generally classified into superficial or deep infections. Superficial infections occur in the skin and subcutaneous tissues, whereas deep infections can involve the tendon sheaths, adjacent anatomic compartments, deep fascial planes, bursae, joint spaces, and bones. Superficial hand infections are more common than deep infections and are typically managed with elevation, warm soaks, splinting in the position of function, analgesics, and empiric antibiotics when indicated. Paronychia, which can be acute or chronic, is an infection or inflammation of the nail fold. Treatment involves warm soaks, topical antibiotics, and abscess drainage, if indicated. A felon is an infection of the distal pulp of the finger. Treatment often involves surgical drainage and empiric oral antibiotics. Herpetic whitlow is caused by herpes simplex virus and typically resolves without intervention. Deep hand infections include pyogenic flexor tenosynovitis and clenched-fist bite wounds. Pyogenic flexor tenosynovitis is a rapidly progressing bacterial infection of the flexor tendon sheaths in the hand, most commonly caused by a penetrating injury to the finger. Clenched-fist bite wounds result from direct contact of the fist on incisor teeth and are associated with polymicrobial infections. Empiric antibiotics and prompt surgical consultation are indicated to reduce long-term morbidity.

STATEMENT 5 It is desirable that in any ED is available the first administration of rabies vaccine (for at least two patients). Doses sufficient for full courses of rabies immunoglobulin treatment for two patients should be available in Poison Control Centers and in 2nd level EDs (at least 1 for every 5 million inhabitants and at least 1 in each major island).

STATEMENT 6 It is desirable a proper and timely implementation of procedures and methods for preventing infection in any traumatic wound. The identified methods of preventing infection are the following: 6A. Irrigation using appropriate security safeguards. Irrigation can be performed with saline (or tap water), with high pressure if necessary, according to the degree of contamination of the wound and the anatomic location. 6B. Search for foreign bodies. Beside an accurate visual inspection, X-rays, CT or ultrasound examination should be taken into consideration. 6C. Suture technique ✓ Avoid shaving of hair ✓ With simple stitches, always after irrigation ✓ The intradermal suture should be avoided in most cases ✓ If the risk of infection is high suture may be delayed.

STATEMENT 7 All the wounds of the hand should be carefully evaluated, considering them at high risk of error. 7A. Any traumatic injury of the hand should be considered for a possible tendon injury, especially if located on the volar or dorsal side. 7B. Any traumatic injury of the hand should be considered for a nerve injury, especially if located on the lateral side of the fingers 7C. A physical examination should be performed in any traumatic injury of the hand to check for any eventual tendon or nerve damage before performing the anaesthesia. 7D. In every traumatic injury of the hand treated in the emergency department the possibility of performing a follow-up should be considered.

STATEMENT 8 It is a priority to treat pain in traumatic wounds in all patients who attend to the ED. Several different protocols for the pain management are available, both pharmacological and non-pharmacological. Oral, local, intravenous, intra-nasal, and respiratory way (i.e. nitrous oxide) may be taken into consideration.

### Human bite of the eyelids… [^1151AnJh]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Wounds produced by human bites usually produce severe infections, which tend to spread diffusely, discharge foul pus, yield slowly to treatment and cause severe complications and deformities. 1 Human bites may be penetrating or of an avulsive type, complete or incomplete. The common organisms found in wounds produced by human bite are Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus albus, streptococci of various types, the fusiform bacillus, the spirillum of Vincent's angina and numerous spirochetes. Eighty per cent of human bites, according to reports, are bites of the hand, produced, as a rule, by the fist striking the teeth of another. No case of human bite of the eyelids was found reported in the recent literature, and it is easily understandable that this should be a rare occurrence. The treatment of human bites has been the subject of numerous surgical reports. Ordinary surgical methods were unsatisfactory. Lowry2 stated that for fresh bites undoubtedly. Sniderman HR.

### Infectious complications of bite injuries [^116TuMqa]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

Animal and human bite injuries are a public health burden. Dog bites outnumber cat bites, but cat bites pose the greatest risk for infection. Skin and soft tissue infections are the most frequent infectious manifestations resulting from bite injury, although invasive infection may occur through direct inoculation or dissemination through the bloodstream. Although contemporary, well-designed trials are needed to inform clinical practice, preemptive antibiotic therapy after a bite injury is warranted for injuries posing high risk for infection and for patients at risk of developing severe infection; antibiotics should target aerobic and anaerobic microbes that comprise the oral and skin flora.

Tales of bite injuries from what is the largest freshwater turtle in North America exist anecdotally, yet there are few descriptions of medical encounters for such. The risk of infection from reptilian bites to the hand in an aquatic environment warrants thorough antibiotic treatment in conjunction with hand surgery consultation. We present the first case report of a near total amputation of an index finger in an adolescent boy who had been bitten by a wild "gator snapper".

### Atypical hand infections [^112DUPoq]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Atypical hand infections can be caused by a wide variety of organisms. Some present as superficial or deep infections with the appearance of a common bacterial infection, whereas others follow a more indolent and atypical course. Without clinical awareness of the diversity of organisms that can cause hand infections, treatment can be delayed. Requesting appropriate laboratory testing is imperative when there is suspicion of an atypical hand infection. Often, surgical treatment paired with medical treatment is necessary to eradicate the causative organism. Here, we detailed several bacteria and fungi that may be encountered. Prior knowledge of presentation, history, and course will help guide identification and effective treatment. We also offer two case examples from our own institution.

### Meta-analysis of antibiotics for simple hand injuries requiring surgery [^115f4ZQN]. The British Journal of Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Simple hand trauma is very common, accounting for 1·8 million emergency department visits annually in the USA alone. Antibiotics are used widely as postinjury prophylaxis, but their efficacy is unclear. This meta-analysis assessed the effect of antibiotic prophylaxis versus placebo or no treatment on wound infection rates in hand injuries managed surgically.

Methods

Embase, MEDLINE, PubMed, Cochrane Central, ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Portal were searched for published and unpublished studies in any language from inception to September 2015. The primary outcome was the effect of antibiotic prophylaxis on wound infection rates. Open fractures, crush injuries and bite wounds were excluded. Study quality was assessed using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool. Data were pooled using random-effects meta-analysis, and risk ratios (RRs) and 95 per cent c.i. obtained.

Results

Thirteen studies (2578 patients) were included, comprising five double-blind randomized clinical trials, five prospective trials and three cohort studies. There was no significant difference in infection rate between the antibiotic and placebo/no antibiotic groups (RR 0·89, 95 per cent c.i. 0·65 to 1·23; P = 0·49). Subgroup analysis of the five double-blind randomized clinical trials (864 patients) again found no difference in infection rates (RR 0·66, 0·36 to 1·21; P = 0·18).

Conclusion

There was moderate-quality evidence that routine use of antibiotics does not reduce the infection rate in simple hand wounds that require surgery.

Stab wounds

Are prophylactic antibiotics indicated in the setting of stab wounds?

Recommendations: Prophylactic antibiotics are not suggested in simple stab wounds that involve only soft tissue. The exceptions to this recommendation are specific wound-related concerns or underlying patient factors that would increase the risk in which 24 hours or less of antibiotics would be appropriate (table 2).

Discussion: Stab wounds can range from small but deep lacerations to more shallow wounds akin to simple lacerations. They are caused by objects of variable cleanliness. Like all wounds, irrigation and debridement of any devitalized tissue are paramount for infection prevention. Adequate irrigation of the deepest portions of stab wounds can be challenging without extension of the skin defect, and opening the wound further may require sedation or a trip to the operating room. This added morbidity must be weighed against potential benefit. Deeper wounds are at higher risk of infection. The nature of the penetrating object, if known, as well as the extent and type of contamination, might sway a clinician's decision about antibiotics if there is a particular concern (eg, contamination with soil or aquatic microbes). Stab wounds that communicate with deeper body cavities or structures are generally managed based on the underlying injury. As mentioned above, tetanus status should be queried and addressed.

### Updated US public health service guidelines for the management of occupational exposures to human immunodeficiency virus and recommendations for postexposure prophylaxis [^112RDtAU]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2013). Medium credibility.

US PHS guidelines — occupational exposure definition and infectious fluids — An exposure that might place healthcare personnel (HCP) at risk for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is defined as a percutaneous injury or contact of mucous membrane or nonintact skin with blood, tissue, or other potentially infectious body fluids. In addition to blood and visibly bloody body fluids, semen and vaginal secretions also are considered potentially infectious, although they have not been implicated in occupational transmission from patients to HCP. The following fluids also are considered potentially infectious: cerebrospinal, synovial, pleural, peritoneal, pericardial, and amniotic fluid, but the risk for transmission from these fluids is unknown and potential risk to HCP has not been assessed by epidemiologic studies in healthcare settings. Feces, nasal secretions, saliva, sputum, sweat, tears, urine, and vomitus are not considered potentially infectious unless they are visibly bloody. Any direct contact to concentrated virus in a research laboratory or production facility requires clinical evaluation, and for human bites, clinical evaluation must include the possibility that both the person bitten and the person who inflicted the bite were exposed to bloodborne pathogens; transmission by this route has been reported rarely, but not after an occupational exposure. Factors associated with risk for occupational transmission of HIV have been described, and risks vary with the type and severity of exposure.

### The human bite injury: a clinical audit and discussion regarding the management of this alcohol fuelled phenomenon [^116Pk3Va]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Human bite injuries are both deceptive and challenging in their presentation and management. They remain a frequent presentation to our unit, most often following late night alcohol fuelled aggression.

Aims

To audit the management of these wounds, with particular focus on infective complications and outcomes.

Methods

A three year retrospective chart review was undertaken on all patients referred to the plastic surgery unit from 1 January 2003 through to 31 December 2005.

Results

A total of 92 patients with 96 human bite wounds were identified. The majority were male (92%). Alcohol consumption was documented in 86% of cases. The majority (70%) occurred over the weekend or on a public holiday. Facial injuries made up 70% of injuries with the remainder being to the upper limb. The ear was the most common target of all facial injuries (65%). Infection was documented in 18 cases (20%), with bite injuries to the upper limb and those presenting late (> 12 h) having a higher incidence of infection.

Conclusions

Human bite wounds present a challenge to any emergency department, given the many issues involved in their management. Underestimation of the complexity and potential sequelae of these wounds will result in a suboptimal outcome for the patient.

### Bite injuries at a level 1 trauma center in Germany [^116SmUvU]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2025). Medium credibility.

Localization of injuries related to age

In our study, the hand was the most common site of bite injuries, accounting for 56.8% of patients. This was followed by the forearm (17%), lower leg (11.3%), and skull (7.5%). This finding aligns with the results of most other studies, which have identified the upper extremity as the most frequent location in the context of dog bite injuries (42%), followed by the lower extremity (37%) and the head and face (14%). In a recent study on dog bites, the lower limb was the most frequently affected anatomic site (50.6%). As part of the upper extremity, the hand is described as the most frequent location, accounting for approximately 45% of all injuries. The analysis revealed age-specific injury risks for specific body regions, which may be attributed to human behavior toward animals, body size, and other factors. As is the case elsewhere, children are at an increased risk of sustaining bite injuries to the head and neck region. This finding aligns with data from international studies, such as one from New York, which reported that bite injuries in 1998 affected 41% of individuals under the age of 18. The age group most affected is that of children between 7 and 9 years of age, with male children exhibiting a higher prevalence than female children (ratio of 1.4:1). In the case of childhood dog bite injuries in the head-neck-torso region, the age group most affected is that of children under 5 years. It is postulated that the ratio of the large head to a relatively small body, the lack of defensive mechanisms, and the slow reaction time of the child, coupled with the frequency of the child approaching the animal's bowl, may be contributing factors to the high incidence of bites to the head and neck region.

### Bite injuries at a level 1 trauma center in Germany [^117T2vGB]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Bite injuries are a common occurrence and may result in significant morbidity. The aim of the study was to investigate bite injuries, their treatment, and consequences in the urban milieu of a European industrialized nation.

Methods

A retrospective, monocentric analysis was conducted on data of bite injuries during the study period from 2010 to 2020. Factors such as age, sex, vaccination status, injury pattern, injury location, the duration of treatment in outpatient, inpatient, or intensive care settings were investigated together with radiological, laboratory, and microbiological parameters, as well as the therapies employed.

Results

The majority of the included 442 patients were between the ages of 20 and 50, with a mean age of 37.2 ± 18.4 years (0.7–91). The female sex was more frequently affected (59%). Most bite injuries were caused by dogs (49.9%), followed by cats (36.1%) and humans (9.8%) and were often caused by domestic animals (78%). The hand was the most common site of bites (n = 251), followed by the forearms (n = 75) and lower legs (n = 43). In children under the age of 10, the head was the most common site of bites. In only 5% of patients, injuries extended to deeper structures. Wound infection was observed in 14.7% of the bite wounds. The mean number of treatment days for patients with infected bite wounds was significantly higher than that for patients with non-infected wounds, regardless of whether they were outpatients, inpatients, or intensive care patients (p = 0.001, p < 0.001, and p = 0.003, respectively).

Conclusions

In accordance with the severity of the injury, a prompt examination, imaging, laboratory diagnostics, and individualized therapy are required. The implementation of an early therapeutic regimen comprising debridement and irrigation, calculated antibiotic therapy, and immobilization can effectively mitigate the risk of developing a fulminant wound infection. Similarly, bite wounds caused by exotic species are to be treated with haste and precision.

### 2018 WSES / SIS-E consensus conference: recommendations for the management of skin and soft-tissue infections [^115NHrBg]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

There is clinical consensus that patients may be divided into low- and high-risk groups depending on the cause, nature, and location of the injury and on patient characteristics, but no evidence-based guidelines are currently available.

Deep irrigation of the wound serves to remove foreign bodies and pathogens. Irrigation under pressure is not recommended, as it may lead to the uncontrolled spread of bacteria into deeper tissue layers. Surgical treatment is based on the removal of necrotic tissue and mechanical reduction of the burden of pathogens. Universal prophylaxis with antibiotics is not recommended. The comprehensive meta-analyses of Medeiros et al. in the Cochrane Database demonstrated no evidential basis for a reduction of the infection rate by prophylactic antibiotics, except for bite wounds on the hands. Despite the poor state of the evidence, most experts recommend early antibiotic treatment for 3 to 5 days for fresh, deep wounds and wounds in certain critical bodily areas (hands, feet, areas near joints, face, genitals), for persons at elevated risk of infection, and for persons with implants, such as artificial heart valves. Antibiotics should not be given if the patient presents 24 h or more after the bite and there are no clinical signs of infection.

Significant burn injuries can predispose to infectious complications. Burn wound infections are one of the most important and potentially serious complications that occur in the acute period following injury. Accurate management of the wound with early excision of the eschar can substantially decrease the incidence of invasive burn wound infection. Damage to this barrier following a burn disrupts the innate immune system and increases susceptibility to bacterial infection. Although burn wound surfaces are sterile immediately following thermal injury, these wounds may be colonized with microorganisms. If the patient's host defenses and therapeutic measures (such as excision of necrotic tissue and wound medications) are inadequate, microorganisms can colonize viable tissue, and a burn wound infection may occur.

Burn wound infections usually are polymicrobial. They can be immediately colonized by Gram-positive bacteria from the patient's endogenous skin flora or the external environment. However, they can also be rapidly colonized by Gram-negative bacteria, usually within a week of the burn injury. Bacterial cultures can aid in the selection of an appropriate antibiotic, especially in cases of bacterial drug resistance, but altered pharmacokinetic parameters in burn patients must be considered and dosing should be adjusted accordingly to maximize antibiotic efficacy.

Bartonella spp. and Brucella spp. in anti-TNF therapies — background and epidemiology indicate these are potential zoonotic granulomatous infections in adults receiving anti-TNF therapies, with Bartonella spp. and Brucella spp. infection rates of < 1/100,000 patients associated with infliximab use; there have been no published cases in children with inflammatory bowel disease receiving anti-TNF therapies. Cats are a natural reservoir for Bartonella henselae; contact with kittens that are asymptomatic but more likely to have bacteremia is associated with human infection from a scratch or bite or via hands contaminated by flea feces touching an open wound or mucosal surface, and brucellosis is a zoonotic disease transmissible through contact of mucous membranes, cuts in the skin, inhalation of contaminated aerosols, or ingestion of infected foods (most commonly unpasteurized dairy products).

Wilderness Medical Society basic wound management — timing of wound closure: Infection is unlikely to occur with less than 10^5 bacteria per gram of tissue, and a bacterial count greater than 10^5 occurs in a traumatic wound within 5 hours of injury; for many years this period of 5 hours has been accepted as the "golden period". Studies report significantly more infections in hand and forearm wounds presenting after 4 hours, no difference in hand wound infections up to 18 hours, no increase in wound failure when closed before 19 hours after injury, and increased risk of infection after 10 hours (8 hours for hand wounds). Most clean wounds can be safely closed up to 6 hours after injury, up to 10 hours for face and scalp wounds. Recommendation grade: 1C.

Localization and extent of the injury

The most common site of injury was the hand, accounting for 251 patients (56.8%). Injuries to the forearm were the second most frequent, occurring in 75 patients (17.0%), whereas injuries to the lower leg and head and neck region were less common, occurring in 50 patients (11.3%) and 33 patients (7.5%), respectively. These findings are illustrated in figure 2.

In the younger age groups (up to 10 years old), the head and neck region was affected as the second most frequent site of injury, whereas in older children (aged 11–18 years), the injury pattern observed was similar to that seen in adult patients (figure 3).

Figure 3
Regions of bites within the age groups. Values are in percentage of age groups (developmental stages) up to 10 years, 11–18 years and more than 19 years.

In 4.5% of patients with bite injuries were higher-grade injuries present, in which deeper structures such as nerves, tendons, bones, vessels, or fasciae were affected.

Radiological examination revealed the presence of tooth fragments in two patients, whereas evidence of fracture was observed in 10 instances.

Infections

As a potential sign for infections, the level of CRP was markedly elevated in 14.7% (65 patients) of infected bite wounds at admission, with a mean of 2.8 mg/dL ± 4.4 mg/dL, in comparison to non-infected wounds, which exhibited a mean of 1.2 mg/dL ± 1.6 mg/dL (p = 0.015). In contrast, no significant difference was identified in the leukocyte count (mean 10.2 ± 3.6 × 10⁹/L infected vs mean 10.2 ± 2.9 × 10⁹/L non-infected; p = 0.953). Surgical intervention was necessary for 130 patients (29.4%) of the 442 patients. Of these, 51 patients (39.2%) exhibited an elevated CRP.

### A case of a pseudoneoplastic primary syphilis chancre on the neck [^116pSkaA]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This case illustrates an extremely uncommon clinical presentation of primary syphilis. Namely, the rare features of this case include the extragenital location on the neck, the fungating chancre that mimicked a cutaneous neoplasm, and the paucity of other associated clinical findings that typically accompany extragenital chancres, including hosts with HIV or other immunocompromizing conditions.

Syphilitic chancres have been reported to occur at many different extragenital locations in the literature over the last century. Fournier, in 1906, adamantly suggested that chancres have been observed from "head to toe" during times when the disease was not treatable. More recent estimates suggest that extragenital chancres do occur in the range of 5% to 10% of cases, and these predominantly involve the oral mucosa. Other rare anatomic locations have been reported to include the hands, arms, chest, breasts, abdomen, legs, and feet. Interestingly, the presence of a primary syphilitic chancre on the neck raises the question of how this could occur, as it is exceedingly rare.,

Primary syphilis inoculation occurs via a broken skin barrier or intact mucosal surface. Previous reports of extragenital chancres have occurred on a mucosal surface or as a result of a compromised skin barrier. Examples include venereal and nonvenereal transmission to traumatized skin (eg, human bites, scratches, unprotected hands of health care providers, shared syringes). This mechanism also explains the high incidence of oral chancres and anal chancres, specifically in patients who engage in anal sex. Additionally, the high rate of coinfection of syphilis and HIV can be attributed, at least in part, to the mucosal barrier disruption associated with chancre formation in addition to immunologic and behavioral factors. The patient in this case reported having sustained a cigarette burn on his neck during an evening of binge drinking 3 months prior to the presentation that progressed over time. Additional history gathered after excision of the mass revealed that the patient was a heterosexual man with a history of sexual contact with sex workers and alcohol use disorder. Therefore, in the setting of a primary chancre, there is a reason to postulate that the patient may have been infected at the site of the cigarette burn, perhaps by an oral lesion of an infected sexual partner.

Human bite wound infections — key antibiotic choices and organism considerations — include oral amoxicillin-clavulanate 875/125 mg bid and intravenous ampicillin-sulbactam 1.5–3.0 g every 6 h, with doxycycline 100 mg bid as an oral option, for which the table states "Good activity against Eikenella species, staphylococci, and anaerobes; some streptococci are resistant". The text notes involvement of "streptococci, S. aureus, and Eikenella corrodens, as well as with multiple anaerobic organisms", that "Eikenella corrodens is resistant to first-generation cephalosporins, macrolides, clindamycin, and aminoglycosides", and therefore "treatment with amoxicillin-clavulanate, ampicillin-sulbactam, or ertapenem is recommended; if there is history of hypersensitivity to β-lactams, a fluoroquinolone, such as ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin plus metronidazole, or moxifloxacin as a single agent is recommended".

Wound care — risk, cleansing, and dressings: Human and animal bite wounds or wounds contaminated with human or animal saliva are at increased risk for infection, and early administration of antibiotics appears to prevent infection from high-risk human and other mammalian bites to the hand and may be useful for other bites. Several studies have not demonstrated a benefit of wound cleansing with povidone-iodine in addition to irrigation, and similar infection rates appear to occur when wounds are irrigated with tap water, boiled water, distilled water, or sterile saline. Occlusive dressings such as film, petrolatum, hydrogel, and cellulose/collagen dressings result in better wound healing than dry dressings, and there is no indication that antibiotic or antibacterial dressings improve wound healing or decrease infection rates in clean wounds. Wound infection often requires treatment with antibiotics, which must be prescribed by a health care professional.

"The risk of infection from tick-borne illness increases with the time of tick attachment". "Although the risk of contracting a tick-borne illness appears to be more substantial if the tick is attached for > 24 to 48 hours, the tick should be removed as soon as possible to minimize the risk of infection". "The risk of damaging tick mouthparts appears to be lower when health care professionals remove ticks with tweezers compared with laypeople removing ticks by hand". "Other methods of removal, including application of gasoline, nail polish, methylated spirits, petroleum jelly, 70% isopropyl alcohol, or a hot kitchen match, appear to be less effective". "Mechanical removal is accepted by most experts". "Although squeezing the abdomen of the tick on removal has not been definitively linked to transmission of disease, some evidence links squeezing the abdomen of the tick on removal to anaphylaxis resulting from tick bites". "As with any injury, hand washing and wound cleansing should follow tick removal".

### Clinical presentation and bacteriologic analysis of infected human bites in patients presenting to emergency departments [^113DUAZK]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

Previous studies of infected human bites have been limited by small numbers of patients and suboptimal microbiologic methodology. We conducted a multicenter prospective study of 50 patients with infected human bites. Seventy percent of the patients and assailants were young adult men. Fifty-six percent of injuries were clenched-fist injuries and 44% were occlusional bites. Most injuries were to the hands. Fifty-four percent of patients were hospitalized. The median number of isolates per wound culture was 4 (3 aerobes and 1 anaerobe); aerobes and anaerobes were isolated from 54% of wounds, aerobes alone were isolated from 44%, and anaerobes alone were isolated from 2%. Isolates included Streptococcus anginosus (52%), Staphylococcus aureus (30%), Eikenella corrodens (30%), Fusobacterium nucleatum (32%), and Prevotella melaninogenica (22%). Candida species were found in 8%. Fusobacterium, Peptostreptococcus, and Candida species were isolated more frequently from occlusional bites than from clenched-fist injuries. Many strains of Prevotella and S. aureus were beta-lactamase producers. Amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and moxifloxacin demonstrated excellent in vitro activity against common isolates.

Vascular tumours

The ISSVA as well as the WHO classification of soft tissue tumours distinguishes between benign vascular tumours, locally aggressive or low metastatic risk intermediate malignant vascular tumours, and malignant vascular tumours. Some of these tumours preferentially affect the hand (Table 5).

Table 5
Characteristics of the main vascular and perivascular tumours of the hand according to the International Society for the Study of Vascular Anomalies (ISSVA) classification and the WHO classification of soft tissue tumours

Pyogenic granuloma (or lobular capillary haemangioma) is a common benign tumour, usually diagnosed on the basis of its clinical features, although skin biopsies are required to confirm its nature. Pyogenic granuloma is composed of hyperplastic clusters of capillaries arranged in a lobular architectural pattern. Pyogenic granuloma is a misnomer because the condition is not associated with pyogenic infection and it does not histologically represent a granulomatous inflammation. Therefore, the term 'lobular capillary haemangioma' should be preferred. After an initial rapid growth within a few weeks, its size stabilises and rarely exceeds 2 cm. It develops in the superficial dermis — or more rarely in the hypodermis — in the mucosal surfaces, and exceptionally in a vein. The superficial lesions take the appearance of a fleshy vascular, friable, and haemorrhagic nodule. These tumours often occur at the site of even minor trauma, a scratch, or an insect bite. They affect both children and adults. They often accompany pregnancy. The tumour is usually solitary, but disseminated forms exist. Imaging techniques show a small, exophytic, and hypervascular tumour associated with a dramatic increase in the vascular flow of the entire finger (Fig. 15; Additional file 4: Video 4).

### Bite injuries at a level 1 trauma center in Germany [^117BGLVJ]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2025). Medium credibility.

Summary

Bite injuries are a prevalent form of injury globally, with the potential to result in a range of complications at the site of the wound. It is therefore essential that they receive time-critical and individualized care. Children are a high-risk demographic, with the head and neck region being particularly susceptible to injury. In addition to the common dog, cat, and human bites, there are regional differences in the species of domestic and wild animals that may inflict bites. Infection rates also exhibit regional variation, which is likely attributable to differences in the rates of presentation or injury severity.

### Infectious complications associated with toothpick injuries of the hand [^116ur2jE]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2003). Low credibility.

Purpose

Although rare, hand injury caused by toothpicks can result in serious complications similar to hand injury produced by human biting. To emphasize its clinical significance this article describes a group of patients sustaining hand injury induced by toothpicks.

Method

Eight patients who developed cellulitis, abscess, septic arthritis, and/or pyogenic tenosynovitis of flexor tendons after toothpick injuries of the hand were treated at our hospital. Seven of them required admission for antibiotics and surgical treatment.

Results

The 7 admitted patients required multiple debridements (3 times on average) to control infection and administer intravenous antibiotics for mixed aerobic and anaerobic infections showing in wound cultures. The average hospital stay for the 7 patients was 26 days. At follow-up evaluation, 4 patients had full recovery of hand function after various cutaneous flap resurfacing of the wounds or staged tendon reconstruction, whereas the remaining 4 patients had arthritis with flexion contracture of interphalangeal joints or persistent paresthesia of the finger.

Conclusions

Patients injured by contaminated toothpicks should be treated with antibiotics that inhibit the growth of both aerobic and anaerobic organisms immediately after these organisms have been identified from cultures. Moreover early surgical treatment might avoid complications and obtain satisfactory results.

### The tooth, the whole tooth: an unusual fight bite with an unnoticed embedded Tooth in the hand [^115yjKtP]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

A 19-year-old man presented to the plastic surgeons with a wound between his fourth and fifth metacarpophalangeal joints, with associated hand swelling and pain. He admitted to accidentally striking his brother in the mouth the previous evening. His brother reportedly made a hasty exit, and the patient dismissed the wound to his hand until waking up the next morning with swelling, pain and ascending lymphangitis. Radiographs revealed the unusual extent of his 'fight bite' injury with an entire human tooth embedded in his hand. Removal of the tooth and aggressive debridement was performed in theatre. Establishing an accurate account of events in these injuries can be difficult, with the orientation of the tooth in the soft tissues being more consistent with an uppercut than the reported jab. The patient made a good recovery following elevation, intravenous antibiotics, rigorous surgical debridement and postoperative hand therapy.

Primary care physicians must be able to recognize wrist and hand injuries that require immediate attention. A complete history and physical examination, including assessment of distal limb function, are essential. Hemorrhage control is necessary in patients with vessel lacerations and amputations. Amputations require an understanding of the indications and contraindications in the management of the amputated limb. High-pressure injection injuries and compartment syndromes require a high index of suspicion for early recognition. Infectious entities include "fight bite", open fractures, purulent tenosynovitis, animal bites, and retained foreign bodies. Tendon disruptions should be recognized early to optimize management.

### Challenging dogma: optimal treatment of the "Fight bite" [^112QDH35]. Hand (2020). Medium credibility.

Background: The optimal treatment of human bites to the dorsal metacarpophalangeal region (ie, "fight bite") in the absence of gross purulence is controversial. Few studies have compared the outcomes of operative debridement with expectant wound care and oral antibiotics. Methods: We performed a retrospective chart review of all patients evaluated at a Level 1 trauma center over a 10-year period. We compared demographic and clinical characteristics of patients across treatment and outcome groups using the Fisher exact test. Logistic regression models were used to describe the relationships between the outcome and treatment variables. Results: We identified 115 patients with a mean age of 29 years. The mean follow-up was 51.8 days. Seventy-two (63%) patients were treated with antibiotics only. Thirty-two (28%) patients were treated with irrigation in the emergency department (ED) and expectant wound care. Eleven (9%) patients were treated with irrigation and debridement in the operating room. No demographic variables were found to correlate with the treatment selected. A 12% complication rate (major and minor) was observed. After adjusting for duration of follow-up and days to presentation, neither the treatment rendered nor the antibiotics selected influenced the rate of complications. Time to presentation > 24 hours was the only variable associated with higher complication rate (P = 0.003). Conclusions: Not all fight bites require operative intervention. Irrigation in the ED with expectant wound care and oral antibiotics can be sufficient for patients presenting within 24 hours of injury in the absence of gross purulence.

Special considerations

Contamination

When choosing an antibiotic regimen, one must take into account special circumstances regarding the type of contamination involved such as salt water/freshwater, clostridial species, or pet/human bites. Water contamination requires coverage for Vibrio, Aeromonas, Pseudomonas, and other species. Trauma involving salt water should be treated with doxycycline and ceftazidime, or a fluoroquinolone. Freshwater wounds should be managed with ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, or a third-generation or fourth-generation cephalosporin. Potential clostridial contamination, such as farm-related injuries, requires high-dose penicillin irrespective of the fracture type.

A full review of the treatment of bite injuries is beyond the scope of this document, but wounds caused by human, cat, and dog bites (the most common bite wounds encountered) are often treated with antibiotics due to the high load of more variable pathogens found in the oral cavity and the wound mechanism, with punctures that make both natural movement of the bacteria and adequate irrigation difficult. A course of 3–5 days of amoxicillin-clavulanate is a suggested regimen, with clindamycin plus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole two times per day as an alternative for patients with a penicillin allergy. While there is increasing question in the literature about the benefit of treating bite injuries with empiric antibiotics, there seems to be general consensus that injuries in high-risk locations (specifically hands, and over cartilage) and in high-risk patients should be treated. Rabies treatment should also be considered and addressed with any mammalian bite wounds (table 1).

### Cost per case or total cost? The potential of prevention of hand injuries in young children-retrospective and prospective studies [^116zQW89]. BMC Pediatrics (2008). Low credibility.

Details of health-care costs were retrieved from the patient's notes. In addition to this, we collected information about national background, age at the time of injury, sex, date and place of injury, aetiology and diagnosis. Data were also divided by the catchment area, i.e. Malmö municipality (all types of injuries referred to our department), county Skåne excluding Malmö municipality (at time of data collection more severe injuries referred to our department) and southern part of Sweden excluding Skåne (more severe injuries referred to our department).

Based on the diagnoses and the mechanisms of injury, and with experience from our earlier studies, we constructed seven case categories that correspond closely to alternative prevention strategies. These were; A) burn injuries caused by hot objects, B) fingertip injuries caused by jamming in doors or other pinch objects, C) fractures, dislocations and sprains caused by falls or hits, D) tendon and nerve injuries and wounds caused by sharp objects, E) complex injuries (an injury to more than one of the anatomical components of the hand or total or subtotal amputation through the middle or proximal phalanges) caused by falls with sharp objects, F) complex injuries caused by machines and rifles and G) other injuries (which include burn injuries not caused by hot objects, fingertip injuries caused by sharp objects and falls or hits, complex injuries and fractures caused by pinch or crush objects, infections and bites). The study includes all 533 children from 1996–2000 and 2002–2003.

Initial analyses of data showed a linear association between health-care cost and length of stay, but with an increasing variation around the mean trend. Separate cost functions were therefore estimated for three subsamples, following the length of hospital stay: no ward days, 1–3 ward days and 4 or more ward days.

### Treatment and outcome of human bites in the head and neck [^115UBGX3]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

Our goal was to review head and neck human bite injuries for demographic, treatment, and outcome data to identify factors influencing infection. Study design Retrospective chart review of all human bite injuries (adult and pediatric) over 10 years.

Setting

Tertiary referral medical center.

Results

We reviewed 40 human bites (average follow-up, 139 days). Young males were the most common victims, altercation was the most common etiology, and auricular avulsion was the most common injury. Six wounds closed primarily became infected (40%) versus no wound infection with delayed closure. Primary wound closure (P < .01), exposed cartilage (P < .07), and less than 48 hours of intravenous antibiotics (P < .06) were associated with postoperative infection (P < .01).

Conclusion

Human bites to the head and neck, especially those with exposed cartilage, are best treated with at least 48 hours of intravenous antibiotics and delayed surgical closure (> 24 hours postinjury) to prevent infection.

Significance

This information enables the clinician who sees these bite wounds infrequently to understand the treatment associated with avoiding infection.

### Human and other mammalian bite injuries of the hand: evaluation and management [^111qxQys]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2015). Low credibility.

The hand is the most common site for bite injuries. Because of specific characteristics of hand anatomy, bite mechanics, and organisms found in human and animal saliva, even small wounds can lead to aggressive infections. Failure to recognize and treat hand bites can result in significant morbidity. Human and animal bites most commonly lead to polymicrobial bacterial infections with a mixture of aerobic and anaerobic organisms. Pasteurella species are commonly found in dog and cat bite wounds, and Eikenella is characteristic of human wounds. Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, and anaerobic bacterial species are common to all mammals. Although public health measures in developed countries have been highly effective at reducing rabies transmission, dog bites remain the most common source of rabies infection worldwide. Human bites can transmit HIV, hepatitis B, or hepatitis C, especially when contaminated blood is exposed to an open wound. Appropriate management of any mammal bite requires recognition, early wound cleansing, evaluation of injured structures, and infection prophylaxis. Structural repair is performed as indicated by the severity and contamination of the injury, and wounds may require delayed closure. Wound infections typically require débridement, empiric antibiotics, and delayed repair or reconstruction.

### Wilderness Medical Society practice guidelines for basic wound management in the austere environment: 2014 update [^1117wTGV]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2014). Medium credibility.

Wilderness wound infection prophylaxis and prevention — whether or not prophylactic antibiotics are given, wounds should be monitored closely because complications can develop rapidly or in an indolent manner. With the exception of certain specific wound categories, there is scant evidence to support the routine use of systemic antibiotics for prophylaxis against wound infection, with a notable exception of an open fracture in which acute antibiotic administration significantly lowers the rate of infection. Virtually all open wounds are colonized with microorganisms, but this is usually without clinical consequences, and the presence of colonizing bacteria does not constitute infection. A systematic review of mammalian bites showed a statistically significant reduction in infection with prophylactic antibiotics after bites by humans but not after bites by cats or dogs, except bites of the hand; there was also a statistically significant reduction in infection after mammalian bites to the hand. Although dated, there is evidence to support the use of topical antibiotics to promote wound healing and decrease infection.

Skin and soft tissue infections — culture indications and specimen approach emphasize that for the common forms of SSTIs, cultures are not indicated for uncomplicated infections (cellulitis, subcutaneous abscesses) treated in the outpatient setting, and whether lesion or tissue cultures are beneficial in managing cellulitis in the hospitalized patient is uncertain and the sensitivity of blood cultures in this setting is low; cultures are indicated for the patient who requires operative incision and drainage because of risk for deep structure and underlying tissue involvement. In this section, cutaneous infections, involving skin and soft tissue, have been expanded and categorized as follows: trauma-associated, surgical site, burn wound, fungal, viral, human and animal bites, and device-related, and although S. aureus, especially MRSA, and S. pyogenes are the causative agents in the majority of these infections, other microorganisms, including fungi and viruses, are important and require appropriate medical and therapeutic management. At minimum, a Gram stain should be performed to assess and characterize indicators of surface contamination or infection combined with a description of morphotypes.

### Open fractures of the hand: review of pathogenesis and introduction of a new classification system [^117QsWu5]. The Orthopedic Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Open fractures of the hand are a common and varied group of injuries. Although at increased risk for infection, open fractures of the hand are more resistant to infection than other open fractures. Numerous unique factors in the hand may play a role in the altered risk of postinjury infection. Current systems for the classification of open fractures fail to address the unique qualities of the hand. This article proposes a novel classification system for open fractures of the hand, taking into account the factors unique to the hand that affect its risk for developing infection after an open fracture.

Despite the ubiquity of hand trauma, there remains insufficient published data to reliably inform these patients of surgical site infection (SSI) risk. We describe the risk of SSI in a single-centre cohort of patients with hand trauma, with an analysis of the impact of the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.

Methods

Retrospective data collection of consecutive patients who underwent surgery for hand and wrist trauma in a single plastic surgery centre over two, three-month periods. Demographic, injury and operative details, alongside prophylactic antibiotic use, were recorded. Burn injuries and wounds infected at presentation were excluded. Presence of SSI at 30 days (90 days if a surgical implant was used) was assessed.

Results

Overall, 556 patients - 'Pre-COVID-19' (n = 310) and 'During COVID-19' (n = 246) - were included. Risk of SSI was 3.6% in the aggregated cohort. Female patients were more likely to develop an SSI, even when adjusted for their greater prevalence of bite aetiologies (adj OR 2.5; 95% CI, 1.00–6.37 and p < 0.05). The absolute risk of SSI in the 'Pre-COVID-19' group was 2.3% and 5.3% in the 'During COVID-19' group. The relative risk of developing an SSI in the 'During COVID-19' group was 2.34 (95% CI, 0.95–5.78 and p = 0.06). Baseline characteristics were equivalent between the two groups.

Conclusion

The risk of SSI in hand trauma is the same as the nationally estimated risk for all surgeries; 3–5%. Changes in presentation and practice associated with the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic did not appear to alter the risk of SSI in patients undergoing surgery for hand trauma.
