## Question

Behavioral Observation During Evaluation

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to approach behavioral observation during evaluation. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about clarifying the clinical question and context for observation. Then, I should consider how patient characteristics modify the observational strategy. Next, I will optimize the environment and select appropriate tools. After that, I will focus on executing structured, multi-domain observation and documenting both quantitative scores and qualitative behaviors. Then, I must recognize bias and time constraints, and finally integrate observed data with converging sources to inform decisions, including special considerations for telehealth and acute settings where observation plays a different role.

> Let me first confirm the clinical question and context, because misalignment here can invalidate downstream observation; the aim of observation differs when screening for dementia vs assessing nonverbal pain vs monitoring response to antipsychotics in BPSD or performing a rapid ED mental status check, and each context dictates different tools, timing, and interpretations; importantly, observation supports diagnosis but is not itself diagnostic, so I need to ensure I don't overstate its standalone value [^115kPovy] [^114D7PPV] [^112LqL3G] [^112tVd9B].

> Wait, let me verify how patient characteristics reshape my approach; age, developmental level, baseline cognition, and communication capacity alter both what I observe and how I interpret it — brief observations in toddlers miss a substantial proportion of autism cases, self-report of pain becomes less valid with moderate-to-severe dementia prompting reliance on observational scales, and unstructured clinic observations of ADHD align more with parent than teacher ratings, underscoring informant effects and the risk of context-driven misclassification [^115EKvnR] [^1165ZSNy] [^114otLc9].

> I need to check the environment next; a comfortable, nonjudgmental, low-distraction setting maximizes the validity of mental status observations, yet I should balance this with judicious collateral input from family — helpful for history, but potentially biasing real-time performance — so I should ensure private time with the patient while leveraging family for corroboration afterward [^112LqL3G] [^115Rz7Ep].

> Hold on, I should verify that tool selection matches context; screeners like Mini-Cog, GPCOG, or MoCA identify who needs further evaluation but are not diagnostic, and my choice should align with suspected conditions and goals (e.g. CAM for delirium, PANSS for schizophrenia symptom monitoring, quantitative measures for tracking BPSD treatment response), recognizing sensitivity/specificity trade-offs and feasibility constraints in busy clinical settings [^113i5AUT] [^1162Dy5j] [^117UscBa] [^112tVd9B].

> Next, I will now examine the need for systematic, multi-domain observation; restricting attention to one behavioral slice risks missing diagnostic patterns, so I should structure observation across domains such as attention, executive function, language, memory, thought content/process, affect, behavior, praxis, and visuospatial skills while staying alert for novel, situationally triggered findings, especially given the heterogeneity of BPSD presentations [^112x9F6u] [^115aXpU9].

> Let me double-check my documentation strategy; I should pair quantitative scores (e.g., standardized measures for cognition or behavior) with rich qualitative descriptions that capture context, triggers, and functional impact because diagnosis and management hinge on converging evidence rather than isolated scores, and patient- and observer-reported perspectives often contribute uniquely rather than redundantly [^115qzmfT] [^113JAGm8].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I should not jump to conclusions from brief, unstructured observation; experts can miss a notable fraction of cases with short samples, behavioral marker systems often lack robust reliability and validity, and single time points may mislead — thus I need structured approaches, trained raters when feasible, and repeated observations or objective pattern metrics when behavior varies over time [^115EKvnR] [^116K2q94] [^111NY44n].

> Let me think about psychometrics and rater effects; I should confirm that tools used have acceptable inter-rater reliability, test-retest reliability, and internal consistency, recognizing that reliability ≥ 0.80 is excellent, and where reliability is limited, I must temper inferences and consider additional training, calibration, or triangulation to mitigate rater drift [^1136Q9M7] [^116K2q94].

> I should confirm integration with other data; observation must be triangulated with history, cognitive testing, affective/functional assessments, caregiver reports, and the general neurological examination, privileging patterns that converge across sources and exploring discrepancies for diagnostic insight rather than dismissing them as noise [^115qzmfT] [^112LqL3G].

> Hold on, I should verify telehealth implications; remote cognitive and behavioral assessments can be valid when instruments are acceptable and feasible, but emerging evidence suggests tele-assessment should not replace in-person evaluation if comorbidities or sensory/motor factors preclude reliable testing, so I need to document why remote observation is fit-for-purpose and plan in-person follow-up when uncertainty remains [^115qzmfT] [^112LqL3G].

> Let me reconsider communication factors that can shape observed behavior; clinician presence and nonverbal communication can alter patient engagement and performance, so I should be mindful of my posture and relational stance to avoid inadvertently biasing observations while still building rapport that facilitates authentic behavior sampling [^113peCU5] [^113iLont].

> I need to ensure the synthesis remains context-specific; for dementia-related agitation or psychosis, quantify symptoms to track treatment response; for delirium, apply CAM; for schizophrenia, anchor symptom monitoring to a validated scale; and for pediatric or advanced dementia pain, prefer context-validated observational tools while recognizing habituation in chronic pain behaviors and the limits of observer-only inference [^112tVd9B] [^1162Dy5j] [^117UscBa] [^113zDqeh] [^1165ZSNy].

> But wait, what if my initial plan leans too heavily on a favored tool; I should double-check that my chosen measure is validated for the specific population and setting (e.g., developmental stage, language/culture, inpatient vs clinic), and if not, adjust the strategy or add complementary measures to preserve validity and minimize misclassification risk [^113i5AUT] [^112x9F6u] [^115qzmfT].

> Finally, I will synthesize the observation within a broader diagnostic framework; observation is a critical data source that supports, but does not replace, clinical judgment and structured evaluation — so I will document the question, context, tools, environment, observed multi-domain behaviors, quantified scores, qualitative descriptors, reliability considerations, and cross-source convergence, stating explicitly what is suggested vs proven, and indicating next steps for confirmatory testing or longitudinal follow-up [^112LqL3G] [^115qzmfT].

Behavioral observation during evaluation is a **structured, systematic process** [^112x9F6u] that captures real-time, objective data on patient behavior, communication, and affect, providing critical context for diagnosis and treatment planning. It is especially valuable when self-report is limited or unreliable, and should be **integrated with standardized tools** [^112LqL3G] and clinical judgment to ensure accuracy and reliability [^1162syPw]. Key elements include appearance, motor activity, speech, mood/affect, thought processes, cognition, and insight/judgment, with attention to nonverbal cues [^113iLont] and environmental factors. Observations must be documented clearly and interpreted within the clinical context, using validated scales when appropriate [^113i5AUT], to guide diagnosis, risk assessment, and treatment response monitoring [^1162syPw] [^112tVd9B].

---

## Definition and purpose

Behavioral observation is the **systematic recording** of patient behaviors, communication, and affect during clinical encounters. It provides **objective data** [^112x9F6u] that complements self-report and standardized tests, supporting accurate diagnosis, risk assessment, and treatment planning [^1162syPw].

## Methods and tools for behavioral observation

Behavioral observation may be conducted using **various methods and tools**, including:

- **Structured observation**: Systematic recording of specific behaviors using predefined criteria or checklists [^116K2q94].
- **Unstructured observation**: General observation without predefined criteria, relying on clinical judgment and experience [^112x9F6u].
- **Standardized tools**: Validated instruments such as the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), and Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) [^112LqL3G] [^113i5AUT] [^117UscBa].
- **Behavioral marker systems**: Domain-specific systems for assessing teamwork, communication, and other behaviors in healthcare settings [^116K2q94].

---

## Clinical significance and applications

Behavioral observation is **clinically significant** for several reasons:

- **Diagnostic accuracy**: Enhances diagnostic accuracy by providing objective data on patient behavior and mental status [^1162syPw] [^112x9F6u].
- **Risk assessment**: Facilitates identification of suicide risk, aggression, and other safety concerns [^1162syPw].
- **Treatment planning**: Informs treatment decisions, including medication management and psychosocial interventions [^112x9F6u].
- **Monitoring treatment response**: Allows clinicians to track changes in behavior and symptom severity over time [^112tVd9B] [^117UscBa].

---

## Challenges and limitations

Despite its clinical utility, behavioral observation has **several limitations**, including observer bias [^116K2q94], cultural differences that shape behavior and its interpretation [^113peCU5], and clinical environmental factors that may not reflect typical behavior. Because of its **limited scope**, brief encounters may not capture the full range of patient behaviors.

---

## Best practices for effective behavioral observation

To ensure **accuracy and reliability**, clinicians should adhere to the following best practices:

- **Use standardized tools**: Employ validated instruments and checklists to guide observation and reduce bias [^1162syPw].
- **Document clearly**: Record observations objectively, avoiding subjective interpretations [^114D7PPV].
- **Consider context**: Interpret behaviors within the patient's cultural, social, and environmental context [^113peCU5].
- **Integrate multiple sources**: Combine behavioral observation with self-report, collateral information, and standardized tests [^1162syPw].
- **Maintain clinical judgment**: Use professional judgment to interpret observations and guide clinical decisions [^112LqL3G] [^112x9F6u].

---

## Documentation and interpretation

Effective documentation and interpretation require **clear documentation** of specific behaviors, their context, and clinical significance; use of descriptive, nonjudgmental language; and integration of observations into the broader clinical context — including history, cultural factors, and clinical judgment. These practices maintain objectivity and ensure observations are clinically meaningful [^112x9F6u].

---

## Impact on diagnosis and treatment planning

Behavioral observation **enhances diagnostic accuracy** by adding objective data to support diagnoses [^1162syPw]; informs the selection of appropriate interventions and monitoring of treatment response [^112tVd9B]; and facilitates early identification of safety concerns and risk factors. These contributions shape individualized treatment planning and ongoing risk management.

---

Behavioral observation during evaluation is a **critical component** of clinical assessment, providing objective data on patient behavior, communication, and affect. It enhances diagnostic accuracy, informs treatment planning, and supports monitoring of treatment response. Clinicians should use standardized tools, document clearly, and interpret observations within the clinical context to ensure accuracy and reliability.

### Mental status examination in primary care [^112LqL3G]. American Family Physician (2024). Low credibility.

The mental status examination relies on the physician's clinical judgment for observation and interpretation. When concerns about a patient's cognitive functioning arise in a clinical encounter, further evaluation is indicated. This can include evaluation of a targeted cognitive domain or the use of a brief cognitive screening tool that evaluates multiple domains. To avoid affecting the examination results, it is best practice to ensure that the patient has a comfortable, nonjudgmental environment without any family member input or other distractions.

An abnormal response in a domain may suggest a possible diagnosis, but neither the mental status examination nor any cognitive screening tool alone is diagnostic for any condition. Validated cognitive screening tools, such as the Mini-Mental State Examination or the St. Louis University Mental Status Examination, can be used; the tools vary in sensitivity and specificity for detecting mild cognitive impairment and dementia. There is emerging evidence for the validity of cognitive screening performed during telemedicine visits, but it should not replace in-person evaluation of patients who have comorbidities that would preclude reliable testing via telephone or video. The workup after abnormal results of a mental status examination or cognitive screening tool is based on clinical judgment and primarily focuses on ruling out reversible causes of impairment and considering the need for further neuropsychiatric evaluation.

### The mental status examination [^112x9F6u]. American Family Physician (2016). Low credibility.

The mental status examination includes general observations made during the clinical encounter, as well as specific testing based on the needs of the patient and physician. Multiple cognitive functions may be tested, including attention, executive functioning, gnosia, language, memory, orientation, praxis, prosody, thought content, thought processes, and visuospatial proficiency. Proprietary and open-source clinical examination tools are available, such as the Mini-Mental State Examination and the Mini-Cog. Physician judgment is necessary in selecting the most appropriate tool for an individual patient. These tools have varying sensitivity and specificity for neurologic and psychiatric disorders, but none are diagnostic for any mental status disorder and each must be interpreted in the context of physician observation. The mental status examination is useful in helping differentiate between a variety of systemic conditions, as well as neurologic and psychiatric disorders ranging from delirium and dementia to bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. There are no guidelines to direct further testing in the setting of an abnormal mental status examination; therefore, testing is based on clinical judgment.

### Coaching primary care clinicians in the ambulatory setting: Direct observation and deliberate practice [^114j8swo]. Family Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

Clinical coaching programs can improve clinician performance through feedback following direct observation and the promotion of reflection. This study assessed the feasibility and acceptability of a primary care coaching program applied in community-based practices.

- **Methods**: Using a 31-item behavioral checklist that was iteratively revised, four faculty observed 18 community-based primary care clinicians (15 of whom were physicians) across 36 patient encounters. Each behavior was scored as a binary variable (observed or not observed). After watching them care for patients, each clinician participated in a focused feedback session to discuss strengths and areas for improvement.

- **Results**: Behaviors observed with the highest frequency were: reflects compassion (100%), appears to enjoy caring for the patient (100%), leads and follows with open-ended questions (97%), and asks thoughtful and smart questions (95%). Areas for improvement were those behaviors done less commonly: apologizes for running behind schedule (18%), acknowledges computer and/or explains role in patient care (14%), and assesses understanding (teachback; 7%). Most clinicians agreed or strongly agreed that they would like to be coached again in the future (81%), and that the coaching feedback would help them become more effective in primary care practice (94%). Nearly all patients surveyed substantiated that it did not bother them to have another doctor in the room and that it is a good idea to offer coaching to clinicians to help them improve.

### A systematic review of behavioural marker systems in healthcare: What do we know about their attributes, validity and application [^116K2q94]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2014). Low credibility.

- **Objective**: Behavioural marker systems are advocated as a method for providing accurate assessments, directing feedback, and determining the impact of teamwork improvement initiatives. The present article reports on the state of quality surrounding their use in healthcare and discusses the implications of these findings for future research, development, and application. In doing so, this article provides a practical resource where marker systems can be selected and evaluated based on their strengths and limitations.

- **Methods**: Four research questions framed this review: what are the attributes of behavioural marker systems? What evidence of reliability and validity exists? What skills and expertise are required for their use? How have they been applied to investigate the relationship between teamwork and other constructs?

- **Results**: Behavioural marker systems are generally designed for specific work domains or tasks. They often cover similar content with inconsistent terminology, which complicates the comparison of research findings across clinical domains. Although several approaches were used to establish the reliability and validity of marker systems, the marker system literature, as a whole, requires more robust reliability and validity evidence. The impact of rater training on rater proficiency was mixed, but evidence suggests that improvements can be made over time.

- **Conclusions**: A consensus of definitions for teamwork constructs must be reached to ensure that the meaning behind behavioural measurement is understood across disciplines, work domains, and task types. Future

### Evidence-based evaluation of psychiatric patients [^11732WU9]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

There has been much discussion in the literature concerning the medical evaluation of the psychiatric patient. The medical evaluation of the psychiatric patient involves obtaining a history, performing an appropriate physical and mental status examination, and testing when indicated. This review applies the rigors of evidence-based evaluation of the medical literature that is currently available to determine when it is safe to place a patient with behavioral complaints under psychiatric care.

### The development of a self-management evaluation scale for elderly adults with hypertension based on the capability, opportunity, and motivation-behaviour (COM-B) model [^117GSF5F]. BMC Geriatrics (2023). Low credibility.

Accurate evaluation tools are a prerequisite in clinical practice and a key to discovering influencing factors and implementing interventions. A review of the existing literature revealed that most evaluation tools for self-management in elderly patients with hypertension were designed by researchers according to their research objectives, lacked a theoretical basis, and did not have broad applicability, which made it difficult for medical staff to understand the patient's condition. Consequently, the intervention measures taken might not be effective.

- **Sentence case**: Up to the time of writing, the Knowledge-Attitude-Practice (KAP) model and the Information-Motivation-Behavioral (IMB) model have been widely used in self-management of hypertension in China; however, they only focus on aspects of individual knowledge and motivation, neglecting the external environment and personal motivation. The role of an individual's ability in behavior change has not been fully explored and utilized to maximize the intervention effect. The Capability, Opportunity, and Motivation-Behaviour (COM-B) model is the only behavior change model linking influencing factors of behavior and intervention strategies, providing clear guidance for behavior analysis and intervention design. It emphasizes analyzing factors and mechanisms influencing individual behavior, focusing on capability (psychological and physical abilities, such as knowledge and skills) and opportunity (physical and social environment, such as medical and family support).

### Identifying autism in a brief observation [^115EKvnR]. Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Pediatricians, neurologists, and geneticists are important sources for autism surveillance, screening, and referrals, but practical time constraints limit the clinical utility of behavioral observations. We analyzed behaviors under favorable conditions (i.e. video of autism evaluations reviewed by experts) to determine what is optimally observable within 10-minute samples, asked for referral impressions, and compared these to formal screening and developmental testing results.

- **Methods**: Participants (n = 42, aged 15 to 33 months) were typically developing controls and children who screened positive during universal autism screening within a large community pediatric practice. Diagnostic evaluations were performed after screening to determine group status (autism, language delay, or typical). Licensed psychologists with toddler and autism expertise, unaware of diagnostic status, analyzed two 10-minute video samples of participants' autism evaluations, measuring five behaviors: responding, initiating, vocalizing, play, and response to name. Raters were asked for autism referral impressions based solely on individual 10-minute observations.

- **Results**: Children who had autism showed more typical behavior (89% of the time) than atypical behavior (11%) overall. Expert raters missed 39% of cases in the autism group as needing autism referrals based on brief but highly focused observations. Significant differences in cognitive and adaptive development existed among groups, with receptive language skills differentiating the three groups.

### Remote cognitive and behavioral assessment: Report of the Alzheimer Society of Canada Task Force on dementia care best practices for COVID-19 [^115qzmfT]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2020). Low credibility.

The same principles apply for telehealth as they do for in-person testing: instruments should be easy to administer and acceptable to both the patient and family members. Ideally, instruments should be valid and reliable, measure change over time, and not be biased by language, sensorimotor limitations, education, or culture.

A report by the American Academy of Neurology Behavioral Neurology Section Workgroup in 2015 described the neurobehavioral status exam (NBSE). The NBSE is a battery of domain‐specific cognitive tests that assess attention, executive function, language, memory, visuospatial functioning, and social cognition to be used in combination with a general neurologic examination, with the goals of facilitating diagnosis and guiding management.

The cornerstone of the NBSE is a careful history that includes the chronology, character, and progression of cognitive, affective, behavioral and constitutional symptoms, functional status, and relevant medical history. Clinical diagnosis should be guided by the pattern of clinical findings rather than relying on isolated tests. Incisive clinical judgment is required to ensure that diagnosis is based on converging evidence from the history, cognitive testing, affective, functional, and behavioral assessments, and the general neurological examination.

Adopting a 'dashboard framework' to manage complex cognitive, behavioral, and neuropsychiatric symptoms can help track the goals of care.

### Anaphylaxis: A 2020 practice parameter update, systematic review, and grading of recommendations, assessment, development and evaluation (GRADE) analysis [^112WyVvn]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). High credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for anaphylaxis, with specific respect to clinical observation, the AAAAI/ACAAI 2020 guidelines recommend considering extended clinical observation in a setting capable of managing anaphylaxis. This is advised to detect a biphasic reaction in patients with resolved severe anaphylaxis and/or those requiring more than one dose of epinephrine.

### Pain in severe dementia: Self-assessment or observational scales [^113537iz]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2006). Low credibility.

To assess the performance of self-assessment scales in severely demented hospitalized patients and compare it with observational data, a prospective clinical study was conducted in geriatric hospital and geriatric psychiatry service settings. Participants included patients diagnosed with dementia according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, with a Mini-Mental State Examination score of less than 11 and a Clinical Dementia Rating score of 3.

Three self-assessment tools — the verbal, horizontal visual, and faces pain scales — were administered in randomized order. A nursing team independently completed an observational pain rating scale. The main outcomes included comprehension (ability to explain scale use and correctly indicate positions for no pain and extreme pain on two separate occasions), inter- and intrarater reliability, and comparison of pain intensities measured by the different scales.

Sixty-one percent of 129 severely demented patients (mean age 83.7, 69% women) demonstrated comprehension of at least one scale. Comprehension rates were significantly better for the verbal and faces pain scales. For patients who demonstrated good comprehension, the inter- and intrarater reliability of the three self-assessment scales was high (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.88–0.98). Correlation between the three self-assessment scales was moderate to strong (Spearman correlation coefficient (r) = 0.45–0.94; P < .001). Observational rating correlated at least moderately with self-assessment (r = 0.25–0.63), although for patients who demonstrated comprehension, better correlations were observed.

### Influence of doctor-patient conversations on behaviours of patients presenting to primary care with new or persistent symptoms: A video observation study [^11279oKt]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2020). Low credibility.

A growing qualitative evidence base shows that doctor-patient interactions can influence patients' perceived eligibility and desire for accessing or reaccessing healthcare. However, this evidence has focused on asking patients about their experiences of accessing healthcare and has not included healthcare professional views. Patient disengagement (e.g. adherence to management plans) is one of the only patient behaviours highlighted as a potential reason for diagnostic error in primary care. There are still crucial gaps in knowledge about the unfolding dynamic nature of the diagnostic process, including the patient's role in the conversation and how this impacts patients' subsequent behaviour.

To address these gaps, we used qualitative methods, including video observation triangulated with follow-up interview data from patients and doctors, to understand doctor-patient communication about a new or persistent presenting problem as a critical point in primary care and assessed the potential impact on timely cancer diagnosis. In particular, we examined what was discussed in conversations about new or persistent presenting problems and how doctors and patients negotiated their significance. We also examined how these negotiations impacted patient attitudes and behaviours and considered the possible impact on timely cancer diagnosis.

### Effect of clinician posture on patient perceptions of communication in the inpatient setting: A systematic review [^113iLont]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

Nonverbal communication plays a pivotal role in the provision of effective patient care and has been associated with important patient health outcomes. Clinician posture, a nonverbal form of communication, may influence the patient experience and satisfaction. The relationship between clinician posture (i.e. standing or at the patient's eye level) and patient perceptions of clinician communication in the hospital — a setting with heightened power dynamics between patient and clinician — is currently unknown.

- **Methods**: We conducted searches of Ovid MEDLINE, EBSCO CINAHL Complete, EBSCO PsycInfo, Elsevier Embase/Embase Classic, Elsevier Scopus, and Web of Science Core Collection up to May 2023. English language studies were included if they compared clinician posture (eye-level or standing) during adult inpatient (including emergency department) interactions. Two authors independently abstracted data from included studies and assessed risk of bias or quality of evidence. A third author arbitrated any disagreements. Studies reported adherence to the posture intervention and/or patient perception outcomes. The latter included encounter duration, preferences for posture type, perceptions of interaction quality and clinician communication and compassion, and standardized assessments of patient satisfaction.

- **Results**: Fourteen studies (six randomized controlled trials, four quasi-experimental studies, four observational studies) assessed clinician posture at the bedside. Ten noted at least one favorable outcome for clinicians who communicated at the patient's eye level.

### Motegrity [^111yCDJ2]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Warnings and precautions**: Monitor patients for suicidal ideation and behavior as well as self-injurious ideation and new-onset or worsening of depression. Instruct patients to discontinue Motegrity immediately and contact their healthcare provider if they experience any unusual changes in mood or behavior, or if they experience emerging suicidal thoughts or behaviors.

- **Suicidal ideation and behavior**: In clinical trials, suicides, suicide attempts, and suicidal ideation have been reported. Additionally, postmarketing cases of suicidal ideation and behavior, as well as self-injurious ideation and new onset or worsening of depression, have been reported within the first few weeks of starting Motegrity [see adverse reactions (6.1, 6.2)]. A causal association between treatment with Motegrity and an increased risk of suicidal ideation and behavior has not been established.

Monitor all patients treated with Motegrity for new onset or worsening of depression, or the emergence of suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Counsel patients, their caregivers, and family members to be aware of any unusual changes in mood or behavior and to alert the healthcare provider. Instruct patients to discontinue Motegrity immediately and contact their healthcare provider if they experience any of these symptoms.

### Correlates of observer-rated active involvement in psychiatric treatment visits [^113JAGm8]. Psychiatry Research (2017). Low credibility.

Among people with serious mental illness, increased patient activation has been linked to a range of key recovery outcomes. At the time of writing, patient activation has been measured largely through self-report. The present study investigated correlates of a new tool that assesses active involvement by rating audio-recordings of treatment visits. The key domains of patient activation assessed in visits included patients asking questions, discussing with providers instances of being active in managing illness outside the session, talking about goals, bringing up concerns, making evaluative statements about treatment, setting the agenda for the visit, and making requests about the course of treatment. The new coding scheme proved to be a feasible and reliable method for identifying multifaceted behavioral indicators of patient activation.

Contrary to our hypotheses, in a sample of 166 people diagnosed with severe mental illnesses, self-reported activation and observer-rated indices of activation were often not correlated or correlated in unexpected directions with the new behavioral measure of patient activation. This suggests that the nature of patient activation may be complex, and work is needed to understand how observer-rated and self-rated activation may predict differential recovery outcomes.

### Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome [^116QgmhR]. Pediatrics (2020). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for neonatal abstinence syndrome, specifically in terms of observation, the AAP 2020 guidelines recommend observing all infants with chronic opioid exposure for at least 72 hours to monitor for the development of withdrawal syndrome. Consider the following monitoring periods for infants with opioid exposure:

- **Immediate-release opioids**: 3 days
- **Buprenorphine and sustained-release opioids**: 4–7 days
- **Methadone**: 5–7 days

### Identifying mild behavioral and neurocognitive impairment in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (MBNI-ALS) provides key prognostic insights [^114gRy9p]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Low credibility.

Following the clinical assessment, all participants underwent a comprehensive neuropsychological battery to evaluate their cognitive and behavioral profiles. The cognitive battery, administered by a neuropsychologist with ALS expertise, included standardized Italian tests assessing executive functions, language, visuospatial abilities, and memory, validated on a large Italian population. As part of this assessment, the ECAS, a widely used multi-domain screening tool for ALS patients and translated into several languages, was administered. However, since ECAS is primarily a screening tool, a more extensive neuropsychological evaluation was performed to provide a detailed assessment of key cognitive domains. The neuropsychological battery was designed to comprehensively assess cognitive functions typically affected in ALS, with a particular focus on executive functions, language, and visuospatial abilities. Multiple tests were used for executive functions to capture distinct subdomains, such as cognitive flexibility, working memory, and inhibition. To ensure robustness and avoid overestimation of impairments, a diagnosis of executive dysfunction required deficits in at least two independent tests within the same domain.

In addition, behavioral changes typically associated with ALS were evaluated through short semi-structured and structured interviews with caregivers. Furthermore, patients were assessed for their autonomy in basic daily living activities (ADL) and instrumental activities of daily living (IAD).

### Problems of video-based pain detection in patients with dementia: A road map to an interdisciplinary solution [^1122syHw]. BMC Geriatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Several studies suggest that the mere use of behavioral pain assessment tools in nursing homes and hospitals increases awareness of pain in health care professionals. In accord, they promote an improvement in the assessment and management of pain in dementia. Lukas et al, for example, showed that the use of behavioral pain assessment tools improved recognition of the presence or absence of pain by over 25% above chance. The available behavioral pain assessment tools for patients with dementia commonly focus on facial expression, body movements, and vocalizations as sources of pain-related information. However, the single items used to assess pain-indicative behavior often vary immensely between scales. This means that there is agreement on the general sources of pain-relevant information in behavior but not on the specific behavioral indicators of pain.

Recent research suggests that among pain-indicative behaviors (e.g. body movements, vocalization, etc), facial expression is one of the most suitable indicators of pain in both cognitively unimpaired individuals and older persons with dementia. We and others have demonstrated that patients with dementia display the same type of facial movements when experiencing pain as cognitively unimpaired individuals do. These facial movements include the contraction of the eyebrows, the contraction of the muscles surrounding the eyes, raising of the upper lip, and opening of the mouth, to mention only a few of the most relevant movements.

### Motivation toward physical activity and nutrition in older cancer patients: The MONAGE protocol using ecological momentary assessment and accelerometers [^113yXwrN]. BMC Geriatrics (2025). High credibility.

The results of the observational part of MONAGE will support the design of an effective and optimized behavior-change intervention for elderly cancer patients, thanks to a tailored approach to the relations between motivation and behaviors. The goal of the interventional part of MONAGE will be to improve physical activity and nutritional behaviors in a new sample of participants. This intervention will be designed in collaboration with patients, their caregivers/partners, doctors, dieticians, adapted physical activity teachers (kinesiologists), and behavior change professionals.

Intervention content will be targeted on the most relevant strategies, based on the results in the observational phase; in other words, the choice and use of behavior change techniques, which are known to significantly lead to a change in physical activity behavior and nutrition. For example, "13.2. Framing/reframing", a behavior change technique which is known to significantly influence attitudes toward the behavior, will only be proposed to participants for whom attitudes toward the behavior have emerged as a significant predictor of the behavior.

During the interventional phase of MONAGE, each patient will undergo a one-week data collection period, similar to that of the observational phase, to determine whether they belong to one of the clusters identified during the observational phase. This identification phase then allows for the delivery of the intervention tailored to the patient's profile.

### Heterogeneity in strategy use during arbitration between experiential and observational learning [^1161UrPn]. Nature Communications (2024). Low credibility.

To navigate our complex social world, it is crucial to deploy multiple learning strategies, such as learning from directly experiencing action outcomes or from observing other people's behavior. Despite the prevalence of experiential and observational learning in humans and other social animals, it remains unclear how people favor one strategy over the other depending on the environment, and how individuals vary in their strategy use. Here, we describe an arbitration mechanism in which the prediction errors associated with each learning strategy influence their weight over behavior.

We designed an online behavioral task to test our computational model and found that while a substantial proportion of participants relied on the proposed arbitration mechanism, there was some meaningful heterogeneity in how people solved this task. Four other groups were identified: those who used a fixed mixture between the two strategies, those who relied on a single strategy, and non-learners with irrelevant strategies. Furthermore, groups were found to differ on key behavioral signatures and on transdiagnostic symptom dimensions, in particular autism traits and anxiety. Together, these results demonstrate how large heterogeneous datasets and computational methods can be leveraged to better characterize individual differences.

### Problems of video-based pain detection in patients with dementia: A road map to an interdisciplinary solution [^1165ZSNy]. BMC Geriatrics (2017). Low credibility.

As mentioned above, research suggests that self-report seems to be valid in patients with mild degrees of dementia. However, self-report in persons with a score below 18 on the Mini Mental Status Examination (MMSE), indicative of moderate-to-strong dementia, may not be valid. Thus, when dementia progresses and the person becomes less verbally communicative, observational pain tools become more important.

Behavioral pain assessment tools typically focus on direct observation of pain-related behaviors, such as facial expression, body posture and movement, vocalization, etc. and may also include changes in behavior and functioning. Research on pain in persons with dementia has largely been dominated by studies on the development of pain assessment tools, with a tremendous increase in attempts during the last two decades. The impressive number of development attempts shows the urgent need for appropriate tools and the insight that most tools are still far from perfect.

But what are the promises and challenges so far?

### An interactional analysis of assessment and feedback between an occupational therapist and a patient with aphasia post stroke [^111faLZN]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2025). Low credibility.

- **Purpose**: After a stroke, patients undergo frequent multidisciplinary assessments. Little is known about patients' experiences of being assessed and the impact of assessment interactions and feedback on ongoing engagement in rehabilitation. This research aims to stimulate reflection on clinical interactions, even during routine clinical assessments, and the provision of assessment feedback.

- **Materials and methods**: This study involved a detailed analysis of an authentic kitchen assessment interaction between an occupational therapist and a patient with aphasia following a stroke. It used a speech function analysis based on systemic functional linguistics, resulting in both dynamic and synoptic data, and a consideration of interactive framing, to explore assessment explanation and feedback.

- **Results**: The analysis revealed the clinician's interactive dominance in terms of the number and type of moves, and misalignment of interactional framing at different points in the exchange. The session appeared to result in patient disengagement related both to the clinician's misjudged response to the patient's aphasia and the context of assessment itself, characterized by a reliance on question-and-answer exchanges and a tendency to highlight deficit.

- **Conclusions**: Assessment sessions may be emotionally challenging for patients following a stroke, and feedback may be interpreted as bad news. Sensitive communication is required to support psychological well-being and engagement in rehabilitation.

- **Implications for rehabilitation**: After a stroke, patients are assessed by the multidisciplinary team to inform subsequent treatment plans.

### Estimates of the validity and utility of unstructured clinical observations of children in the assessment of ADHD [^114otLc9]. Clinical Pediatrics (2005).

The purpose of this prospective study was to examine the validity and diagnostic utility of unstructured clinic observations of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) behaviors in children. Results showed observations to be related to behavioral ratings of parents but not of teachers. The relationship between observations and parent ratings was stronger for hyperactive-impulsive than inattentive behaviors. The level of agreement between observations and classification of ADHD significantly exceeded chance levels only for parent measures of hyperactivity-impulsivity. Only parent measures predicted a diagnosis of ADHD at a rate that was significantly better than chance. Clinic observations were found to have consistently higher positive predictive power than negative predictive power. Clinical implications are discussed.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for acute pain, specifically in terms of clinical examination, the EUSEM 2020 guidelines recommend reviewing observed signs of pain alongside patient self-reports. These signs include heart rate, respiratory rate, facial expressions, and patient expressions of pain, such as groaning. Utilize these observations together with the patient's own evaluation, as relying on them alone can under- or overestimate pain intensity.

### The American Psychiatric Association practice guideline for the treatment of patients with schizophrenia [^1162syPw]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2020). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for schizophrenia, more specifically with respect to initial assessment, APA 2020 guidelines recommend including the following in the initial assessment of patients with a possible psychotic disorder:

- **Reason the patient is presenting for evaluation**: Identify the main concerns prompting the evaluation.

- **Patient's goals and preferences for treatment**: Understand and document the desired outcomes and treatment preferences.

- **Review of psychiatric symptoms and trauma history**: Conduct a comprehensive review to identify relevant symptoms and past trauma.

- **Psychiatric treatment history**: Assess previous psychiatric interventions and outcomes.

- **Assessment of tobacco use and other substance use**: Examine current and past substance use.

- **Assessment of physical health**: Evaluate overall physical health, as it may impact psychiatric treatment.

- **Assessment of psychosocial and cultural factors**: Consider factors such as social support, cultural influences, and economic circumstances.

- **Mental status examination, including cognitive assessment**: Perform a thorough mental status evaluation with a focus on cognitive functioning.

### Validation of a simple tool for electronic documentation of behavioral responses to anesthesia induction [^117DuTJC]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2020). Low credibility.

Anxiety and distress behaviors during anesthesia induction are associated with negative postoperative outcomes for pediatric patients. Documenting behavioral responses to induction is useful to evaluate induction quality at hospitals and to optimize future anesthetics for returning patients, but we lack a simple tool for clinical documentation. The Induction Compliance Checklist is a tool for grading induction behaviors that is well validated for research purposes, but it is not practical for routine documentation in busy clinical practice settings. The Child Induction Behavioral Assessment tool was developed to provide a simple and easy-to-use electronic tool for clinical documentation of induction behaviors. The aim of this study was to test the Child Induction Behavioral Assessment tool's validity with the Induction Compliance Checklist and its interrater reliability.

- **Methods**: This prospective observational study included 384 pediatric patients undergoing anesthesia inhalation induction. Validity with the Induction Compliance Checklist and interrater reliability of the Child Induction Behavioral Assessment were evaluated. Two researchers alternated scoring the Induction Compliance Checklist. The two researchers independently scored the Child Induction Behavioral Assessment. The anesthesia clinician caring for the patient also independently scored the Child Induction Behavioral Assessment by completing their routine documentation in the patient's medical record. Two age groups were evaluated (ages 1–3 and 4–12 years old).

### The patient and observer scar assessment scale: a reliable and feasible tool for scar evaluation [^111rhcdN]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

At present, various scar assessment scales are available, but none have been shown to be reliable, consistent, feasible, and valid simultaneously. Furthermore, the existing scar assessment scales appear to give little weight to the opinion of the patient. The newly developed Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale consists of two numeric scales: the Patient Scar Assessment Scale (patient scale) and the Observer Scar Assessment Scale (observer scale). The patient and observer scales are to be completed by the patient and observer, respectively. The patient scale's consistency and the observer scale's consistency, reliability, and feasibility were tested.

For the Vancouver Scar Scale, which is the most frequently used scar assessment scale at present, the same statistical measurements were examined. The results of the observer scale and the Vancouver scale were compared. The validity of the observer scale was tested with a correlation to the Vancouver scale. Furthermore, the authors examined specific characteristics that significantly influence the general opinion of the patient and the observers on the scar areas.

Four independent observers each used the observer scale and the Vancouver scale to assess 49 burn scar areas, each measuring 3 x 3 cm, belonging to 20 different patients. Subsequently, the patients completed the patient scale for their scar areas. The internal consistency of both the patient and the observer scales was acceptable (Cronbach's alpha, 0.76 and 0.69, respectively), whereas the consistency of the Vancouver scale appeared not to be.

### Neural signatures of emotional intent and inference align during social consensus [^114nspTd]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Previous work correlating observer inferences to targets' self-reports found that accuracy is associated with higher activation in the inferior parietal lobule (IPL), premotor cortex, superior temporal sulcus (STS), and mPFC. Accuracy, however, is not a neural process but an outcome of social signal processing and inference formation. That is, accuracy is determined by how the signaler compresses the information they intend to convey into a recognizable social signal (e.g. a grimace or lowering of the eyes) and how that signal is perceived and interpreted by an observer. To better understand the neural mechanisms supporting accuracy in this task, it is critical to disentangle the signaler's intent from the observer's inference and to model the distributed patterns of brain activity underlying each component. Such models can then be combined to explain the factors that drive individual differences in inference accuracy.

Naturalistic stimuli are necessary for the study of social signal processing. Though static and unimodal stimuli are useful for isolating specific components of emotion perception and induction, low-dimensional stimuli forgo the complexity of the dynamic environments we live in and limit our ability to study social behavior. Naturalistic audiovisual recordings allow us to capture the subtleties of nonverbal communication, such as nuanced facial expressions, tone of voice, and body language. Moreover, naturalistic stimuli reduce demand characteristics and allow us to examine the context in which social interactions occur.

### Systematic review of observational (behavioral) measures of pain for children and adolescents aged 3 to 18 years [^113zDqeh]. Pain (2007). Low credibility.

Observational (behavioral) scales of pain for children aged 3 to 18 years were systematically reviewed to identify those recommended as outcome measures in clinical trials. This review was commissioned by the Pediatric Initiative on Methods, Measurement, and Pain Assessment in Clinical Trials (www.immpact.org).

In an extensive literature search, 20 observational pain scales were identified for review, including behavior checklists, behavior rating scales, and global rating scales. These scales varied in their reliance on time sampling and the inclusion of physiological items, facial and postural items, as well as their inclusion of multiple dimensions of assessment (e.g. pain and distress). Each measure was evaluated based on its reported psychometric properties and clinical utility.

- **Recommendation for specific contexts**: Scales were judged to be indicated for use in specific acute pain contexts rather than for general use. Two scales were recommended for assessing pain intensity associated with medical procedures and other brief painful events. Two other scales were recommended for post-operative pain assessment, one for use in hospitals and the other at home. Another scale was recommended for use in critical care. Finally, two scales were recommended for assessing pain-related distress or fear.

No observational measures were recommended for assessing chronic pain because the overt behavioral signs of chronic pain tend to habituate or dissipate as time passes, making them difficult to observe reliably. In conclusion, no single observational measure is broadly recommended for pain assessment across all contexts.

### Intricacies of human-AI interaction in dynamic decision-making for precision oncology [^117G7pWq]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

We conducted a human–AI interaction study to investigate clinicians' (physicians and residents) collaborative decision-making behavior in knowledge-based response-adaptive radiotherapy (KBR-ART). KBR-ART is an actively researched single-modality and single-intervention adaptive treatment strategy designed to improve patient outcomes. It consists of three phases: pre-treatment assessment, response evaluation, and adaptation.

- **Response evaluation phase**: Patients' treatment response is assessed by comparing pre- and during-treatment multi-omics information.
- **Adaptation phase**: A treatment plan is adapted through dose escalation/de-escalation.

In this study, the clinicians collaborated with ARCliDS — software for dynamic decision-making developed using a model-based deep reinforcement learning algorithm. For application in KBR-ART, ARCliDS uses a graphical neural network-based model of the radiotherapy environment. This model defines a patient's state via a graph of multi-omics features and is capable of assessing treatment response and predicting treatment outcomes.

Prior to this study, we had developed ARCliDS modules for two modalities that were trained on two retrospective cohorts: non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients who had received adaptive radiotherapy (RT) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients who had received adaptive stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT). In this study, we designed a two-phase human–AI interaction study for each of the two modules, in which clinicians were asked to prescribe mid-treatment dose adaptation without (Unassisted phase, Human).

### Intricacies of human-AI interaction in dynamic decision-making for precision oncology [^11659TpY]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

The remarks reported by users provided miscellaneous feedback, offering us additional insights. We found that organs at risk and the patient's treatment response were top priorities, consistent with clinical practice where toxicity is the dose-limiting factor. For NSCLC, evaluators were concerned about esophagus and lung toxicity, while for HCC, liver function and heart toxicity were paramount. Evaluators carefully inspected AI's outcome predictions, not only for the AI recommendation but also for the entire range of decisions. In particular, evaluators closely monitored the NTCP and occasionally bypassed AI's recommendation to lower the complication probability. This behavior is clinically desired, as over-reliance on AI recommendations could lead to erroneous decisions. However, we note that since we received an unequal number of remarks from a few evaluators, the summary may be biased toward those with a higher number of remarks.

To recap, human–AI interaction in dynamic decision-making exhibits high variability as it depends on the complex interrelationship between the expert's prior knowledge and preferences, the patient's state, disease site, treatment modality, and AI behavior. Collaborative decision-making for treating advanced diseases can be summarized as follows: (i) clinicians may not believe in an AI system, thus completely disregarding AI's recommendation; (ii) clinicians may believe in the AI system but will critically analyze AI recommendations on a case-by-case basis; (iii) when clinicians find AI recommendations beneficial to patients, they…

### The Alzheimer's Association clinical practice guideline for the diagnostic evaluation, testing, counseling, and disclosure of suspected Alzheimer's disease and related disorders (DETeCD-ADRD): Validated clinical assessment instruments [^117Lyxm6]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). High credibility.

In an evaluation of a patient with cognitive or behavioral symptoms, a clinician should always ask questions about sleep. Instruments useful for this purpose include the Mayo Sleep Questionnaire and the Scales for Outcomes in Parkinson's Disease (SCOPA). Sleep-related symptoms may be hallmarks of certain neurodegenerative diseases causing dementia, or sleep disorders may adversely impact overall function in any individual, particularly those with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or dementia. Addressing sleep problems through lifestyle interventions improves general health.

Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder, characterized by loss of REM-associated atonia resulting in acting out of dreams, often violently, has a strong association with Lewy body dementia (LBD). Symptoms of REM sleep behavior disorders are even more likely to be under-reported by informants and, almost never, by patients. REM sleep behavioral disturbances may precede by many years what ultimately evolves to become dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) or Parkinson's-related dementia. In cognitively unimpaired persons, reduced slow-wave sleep activity and low sleep efficiency are both associated with an accelerated rate of cortical amyloid beta plaque deposition, and hence the accumulation of Alzheimer's disease-related neuropathological change.

Sleep disorders have multiple relationships with cognitive and behavioral syndromes. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is deleterious to optimal brain function and health. It is common in MCI and can exacerbate impairments in cognition, mood, behavior, and/or function. Treatment of OSA may reverse cognitive and behavioral decline in some patients.

### Observed improvement in cognition during a personalized lifestyle intervention in people with cognitive decline [^113QmiY1]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2023). High credibility.

The primary outcome of the study was changes in cognitive scores. Feasibility was qualitatively assessed. Study visits at baseline, month 1, month 3, month 6, and month 12 included the following assessments conducted by clinical research staff:

- **Cognitive function testing**: The Cambridge Brain Sciences (CBS) assessments were used as the primary measure of cognition throughout the study. The CBS cognitive battery is a validated suite of 12 individual assessments designed to measure function in four cognitive domains — memory, reasoning, verbal ability, and concentration. Each domain is assessed with multiple tasks that the participant completes on a computer, with a composite score for the domain calculated from the individual tasks. The entire battery was completed in 35–45 minutes. The CBS assessments have been used in over 300 peer-reviewed publications and have been used to assess cognitive function in a variety of health conditions, including neurodegenerative diseases and brain structure abnormalities.

- **Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA)**: The MoCA is a brief, single-page, valid and reliable 30-point screening test widely used clinically to assess and screen cognitive status. The MoCA was used to identify participants with OCI. MoCA scores were used as an eligibility criterion and administered at each study visit to track changes in cognition, with the exception of the month 1 study visit due to concerns over test-retest effects.

- **Adverse events**: Adverse events were collected via a standardized adverse events questionnaire at each study visit.

### Behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia: A study of symptomatology [^115aXpU9]. Indian Journal of Psychiatry (2009). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD):

- **Definition**: BPSD is a heterogeneous range of psychological reactions, psychiatric symptoms, and behaviors occurring in people with dementia of any etiology.

- **Pathophysiology**: BPSD are caused due to a complex interplay of psychological, social, and biological factors, including neurochemical, neuropathological, and genetic factors.

- **Disease course**: The complex interaction of psychosocial and biological factors results in BPSD, which have clinical manifestations of agitation, aberrant motor behavior, anxiety, elation, irritability, depression, apathy, disinhibition, delusions, hallucinations, and sleep or appetite changes. Disease progression is associated with poor quality of life (QoL), distress among patients and caregivers, long-term hospitalizations, medication misuse, and increased healthcare costs.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Moderate and severe BPSD are associated with an increased risk of mortality, with hazard ratios of 1.31 (95% CI, 1.08–1.60) and 1.74 (95% CI, 1.44–2.12), respectively.

### Neural mechanisms of social interaction perception: Observing interpersonal synchrony modulates action observation network activation and is spared in autism [^117R3Ch2]. Human Brain Mapping (2024). Low credibility.

How the temporal dynamics of social interactions are perceived arguably plays an important role in how one engages in social interactions and how difficulties in establishing smooth social interactions may occur. One aspect of temporal dynamics in social interactions is the mutual coordination of individuals' behaviors during social interaction, otherwise known as behavioral interpersonal synchrony (IPS). Behavioral IPS has been studied increasingly in various contexts, such as a feature of the social interaction difficulties inherent to autism. To fully understand the temporal dynamics of social interactions, or reductions thereof in autism, the neural basis of IPS perception needs to be established.

The study's aim was twofold: to establish the basic neuro‐perceptual processing of IPS in social interactions for typical observers and to test whether it might differ for autistic individuals. In a task‐based fMRI paradigm, participants viewed short, silent video vignettes of humans during social interactions featuring a variation of behavioral IPS. The results show that observing behavioral IPS modulates the Action Observation Network (AON). Interestingly, autistic participants showed similar neural activation patterns as non‐autistic participants, which were modulated by the behavioral IPS they observed in the videos, suggesting that the perception of temporal dynamics of social interactions is spared and may not underlie reduced behavioral IPS often observed in autism. Nevertheless, a general difference in processing social interactions was found in autistic individuals.

### Combined cognitive remediation and functional skills training for schizophrenia: Effects on cognition, functional competence, and real-world behavior [^112rbG8d]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2012). Low credibility.

Cognitive remediation is an efficacious treatment for schizophrenia and, when used within broader psychosocial treatments, improves transfer to real-world behavior change. The authors examined whether cognitive remediation effectively generalizes to functional competence and real-world functioning as a standalone treatment and when combined with a functional skills treatment.

Outpatients with schizophrenia (N = 107) were randomly assigned to receive cognitive remediation, functional adaptation skills training, or combined treatment, with cognitive remediation preceding functional skills training. Clinical symptoms, neurocognition, social competence, functional competence, and case-manager-rated real-world behavior were assessed at baseline, at the end of treatment, and at a 12-week durability assessment.

Neurocognition improved, with durable effects, after cognitive remediation but not after functional skills training. Social competence improved both with functional skills training and combined treatment but not with cognitive remediation alone. Improvements in functional competence were greater and more durable with combined treatment. Cognitive remediation alone did not produce significant improvements in real-world behavior, but when combined with functional skills training, statistically significant improvements from baseline to the end of treatment and follow-up were observed in community or household activities and work skills. Number-needed-to-treat analyses suggest that as few as three cases are required for treatment to induce a meaningful impact.

### Nonverbal correlates of paranoid ideation - a systematic literature review [^1136RKDd]. Psychological Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

Ideally, auxiliary methods in the form of observations of nonverbal correlates could provide supplemental evidence for diagnosis. Opportunities for assessing these nonverbal correlates exist on multiple facets. Anxiety and negative emotions impact the development and maintenance of persecutory delusions. Negative emotional states have nonverbal correlates including posture, facial expressions, and breathing patterns. This type of additional information could potentially aid the diagnostic process compared to reliance on verbal reports alone.

Additionally, cognitive biases associated with persecutory delusions, such as jumping-to-conclusions and bias against disconfirmatory evidence, could be revealed through nonverbal tasks. One way to do this is through assessment in decision-making tasks when minimal evidence is presented. When decisions are made faster, with less information, a tendency to jump-to-conclusions could be present. Additionally, the perception of threat can trigger physiological and neurobiological reactions. Finally, deficits in social cognition and emotion perception, which impair the ability to accurately interpret and respond to others' mental states, emotions, and social cues, can be assessed nonverbally.

While studies exist that investigate nonverbal correlates, the literature is devoid of a systematic literature review of nonverbal.

### Linking the behavioral assessment screening tool to the international classification of functioning, disability, and health as a novel indicator of content validity [^1169Hm19]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2020). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to use the International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health (ICF) to classify and describe the concepts of the Behavioral Assessment Screening Tool (BAST), which measures behavioral disruptions after traumatic brain injury (TBI). The methods involved linking meaningful concepts in the BAST to the International Classification of Functioning to (1) further explore the validity of the conceptual model of behavior, (2) demonstrate ICF linking as a novel indicator of content validity, (3) identify International Classification of Functioning concepts that characterize behavior, and (4) determine the comprehensiveness of the BAST.

Results indicated that the body functions component and the activities and participation component were most frequently addressed in the BAST. The majority of the TBI Core Set categories were included in the BAST, and the manifest and latent coders agreed 85% of the time. Linking BAST concepts to the International Classification of Functioning demonstrated the BAST's content validity and comprehensiveness. This approach provides a model for how ICF coding could be used to assess content validity.

- **Implications for rehabilitation**: ICF coding can be used to assess content validity and refine rehabilitation measures. The Behavioral Assessment Screening Tool can be used for clinical and research purposes to assess behavior as it relates to a wide range of ICF TBI Core Set categories.

Additionally, the criteria for diagnosing mental illnesses are based on broad categories of symptoms that do not account for individual deviations from these criteria. The increasing availability of personal digital devices, such as smartphones equipped with sensors, offers a new opportunity to continuously and passively measure human behavior in situ. This promises to lead to more precise assessment of human behavior and ultimately individual mental health. More refined modeling of individual mental health and a consideration of individual context, assessed through continuous monitoring, opens the way for more precise and personalized digital interventions that may help increase the number of positive clinical outcomes in mental healthcare. In this paper, we provide a conceptual review of such techniques for measuring, modeling, and treating mental illness and maintaining mental health.

### Interpersonal dyadic influences on transitions between pain states: A narrative review and synthesis [^114miDxL]. Pain (2025). High credibility.

The dynamics of interactions have been neglected. Evidence at the time of writing typically relies on self-reports, usually of the frequency of behaviors. However, the correlation between behavior and self-report is low, especially in interactions where an observer's perception and interpretation may differ substantially from self-reported frequency. The dynamic nature of relationships and interactions requires multiple observers and multiple time points. We recommend more thoughtful decisions about appropriate time frames, which currently range from 7 days to 10 years.

Important gaps identified in our review include:

- **The specific effects** of parental (and partner) anxiety, distinguished from effects of family (dys)function.
- **Possible differences** between maternal and paternal anxiety and catastrophizing, in terms of expressed cognitions, perceived cognition by the person with pain, changes in behavior, and the impact on child pain transitions.
- **Understanding the context** of adaptive/maladaptive behaviors, and which situations determine whether behaviors help or not.
- **Research on fathers**; the majority of research in this review focused on mothers.
- **The role of diagnostic and prognostic uncertainty** in the context of dyads, with respect to vulnerability to anxiety, expressions of pain, worrying and fearful cognitions about pain, and subsequent behaviors of both individuals.
- **The role of in/validation** within these interactions, both in respect of in/validation from clinicians and from a parent/partner.

Careful consideration of these gaps could significantly enhance our understanding of interpersonal dyadic influences on transitions between pain states.

### The mental status examination in emergency practice [^114D7PPV]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2010). Low credibility.

A systematic approach to assessing mental status in the emergency department is key to identifying alterations in mental status and directing diagnostic testing and management. After initial stabilization of the patient, it is critical to assess a patient's alertness, attention, and cognition, and perform a brief psychiatric assessment to fully evaluate a patient with mental status changes. This article offers an approach to allow better management of a patient with altered mental status.

### Practices to foster physician presence and connection with patients in the clinical encounter [^113peCU5]. JAMA (2020). High credibility.

- **Importance**: Time constraints, technology, and administrative demands of modern medicine often impede the human connection that is central to clinical care, contributing to physician and patient dissatisfaction.

- **Objective**: To identify evidence and narrative-based practices that promote clinician presence, a state of awareness, focus, and attention with the intent to understand patients.

- **Evidence review**: Preliminary practices were derived through a systematic literature review (from January 1997 to August 2017, with a subsequent bridge search to September 2019) of effective interpersonal interventions. Observations of primary care encounters in three diverse clinics (n = 27 encounters), and qualitative interviews with physicians (n = 10), patients (n = 27), and nonmedical professionals whose occupations involve intense interpersonal interactions (e.g. firefighter, chaplain, social worker; n = 30) were also included. After evidence synthesis, promising practices were reviewed in a three-round modified Delphi process by a panel of 14 researchers, clinicians, patients, caregivers, and health system leaders. Panelists rated each practice using 9-point Likert scales (-4 to +4) that reflected the potential effect on patient and clinician experience and feasibility of implementation. After the third round, panelists selected their "top 5" practices from among those with median ratings of at least +2 for all three criteria. Final recommendations incorporate elements from all highly rated practices and emphasize the practices with the greatest number of panelist votes.

### Interacting with patients' family members during the office visit [^115Rz7Ep]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

The physician-patient relationship is part of the patient's larger social system and is influenced by the patient's family. A patient's family member can be a valuable source of health information and can collaborate in making an accurate diagnosis and planning a treatment strategy during the office visit. However, it is important for the physician to keep an appropriate balance when addressing concerns to maintain the alliance formed among the physician, the patient, and the family member.

The patient-centered medical home — a patient care concept that helps address this dynamic — often involves a robust partnership among the physician, the patient, and the patient's family. During the office visit, this partnership may be influenced by the ethnicity, cultural values, beliefs about illness, and religion of the patient and their family. Physicians should recognize abnormal family dynamics during the office visit and attempt to stay neutral by avoiding triangulation. The only time neutrality should be disrupted is if the physician suspects abuse or neglect. It is important that the patient has time to communicate privately with the physician at some point during the visit.

### Alternative approaches to outcomes assessment: Beyond psychometric tests [^116pMUoF]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2014). Low credibility.

Outcomes assessments in clinical trials involving cognition and behavior rely upon IQ and neuropsychological assessments. These procedures provide limited evaluations of everyday functions. Some participants cannot perform cognitive tasks because they are low functioning or may represent missing data because of inability to travel. Interview-based assessments of adaptive behavior yield results that reflect everyday functions and can be done by telephone regardless of level of cognitive functioning. The design of the neurobehavioral component of the follow-up study for the management of myelomeningocele fetal surgery trial serves as an example of a clinical trial that incorporates these alternatives.

### An evaluation of accelerometer-derived metrics to assess daily behavioral patterns [^113EYqeJ]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2017). Low credibility.

The way physical activity (PA) and sedentary behavior (SB) are accumulated throughout the day (i.e. patterns) may be important for health, but identifying measurable and meaningful metrics of behavioral patterns is challenging. This study evaluated accelerometer-derived metrics to determine whether they predicted PA and SB patterns and were reliably measured.

- **Methods**: We defined and measured 55 metrics that describe daily PA and SB using data collected by the activPAL monitor in four studies. The first two studies were randomized crossover designs that included recreationally active participants. Study 1 experimentally manipulated time spent in moderate-to-vigorous-intensity PA and sedentary time, while study 2 held time in exercise constant and manipulated SB. Study 3 included inactive participants who increased exercise, decreased sedentary time, or both. The study conditions induced distinct behavioral patterns; thus, we tested whether the new metrics could improve the prediction of an individual's study condition after adjusting for the overall volume of PA or SB using conditional logistic regression. In study 4, we measured the 3-month reliability for the pattern metrics by calculating intraclass correlation coefficients in a community-dwelling sample who wore the activPAL monitor twice for 7 days.

- **Results**: In each of the experimental studies, we identified new metrics that could improve the accuracy for predicting condition beyond SB and moderate-to-vigorous-intensity PA volume. In study 1, 23 metrics were predictive of a highly active condition.

### Dr. Bishop et al. reply [^113VUUdx]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2020). Low credibility.

In "The Need for a Clinically Useful Schema of Social Communication", Blank et al. present an observation and coding method (The Initiating, Responding, Expectancy Violations [IREV] schema) for identifying "expectancy violations (EVs)", which may signal clinically significant departures from normal social communication behavior (e.g. in individuals with autism spectrum disorder [ASD]). The authors point out that "historically, observation of a patient's (social communication) has not been part of the routine psychiatric mental status examination" and argue that this is an important missed opportunity for clinicians. Several direct observation methods exist for identifying and/or monitoring changes in social communication deficits associated with ASD. Despite their established diagnostic validity, it remains true that these measures used in isolation will result in a relatively high rate of "false positives", usually comprising children who are better described with other diagnoses (e.g. intellectual disability, language disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder [ADHD]). This underscores the critical importance of context when interpreting observed social communication deficits.

### Trial of a novel intervention to improve multiple food hygiene behaviors in Nepal [^112DtesR]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2017). Low credibility.

The primary outcome — the proportion of mothers practicing all five target behaviors — was measured by structured observation. The proportion of mothers: 1) cleaning child food serving utensils using soap or ash; 2) washing both hands with soap before feeding the child and washing the child's hands before eating; 3) storing cooked food with a tight lid and no visible flies, dust, or dirt in the food; 4) thoroughly reheating leftover or stored food at an adequate temperature (≥ 70°C); and 5) serving treated water to their children, was assessed by direct observation and temperature measurement.

Assessments took place 45 days before and 45 days after the completion of the 3-month intervention period. Twenty-five female food hygiene observers were recruited and trained to carry out the structured observation of food hygiene behaviors. Observations were made in all intervention households (N = 120, with no loss to follow-up) and control (non-intervention) households (N = 119, with two lost to follow-up) once at baseline and follow-up (post-intervention). Observations were carried out between 1:00 and 5:00, when the behaviors of interest were likely to be seen. Observations took place in both groups simultaneously and were completed within 12 days. Observers were kept blind to the study objectives and had no role in the intervention. A structured observation checklist was used to record all behaviors. After the follow-up observation, the reach of the intervention was assessed to ascertain exposure density and to check for contamination of the control group.

### Capturing measures that matter: The potential value of digital measures of physical behavior for Alzheimer's disease drug development [^111TpAzR]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2023). High credibility.

Beyond providing standalone insights into functional independence, digital measures of real-world physical behavior may enrich established measures of cognition in individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Evidence suggests that combining assessments of cognitive and physical function may provide richer insights into disease progression than either type of assessment alone. For instance, combining assessments of cognition and instrumental activities of daily living outperforms cognitive assessments alone for predicting conversion from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to overt dementia. Supplementing established cognitive outcomes with digital measures of real-world physical behavior could also be a means of demonstrating the meaningfulness of an identified cognitive change. In addition, this approach may help address limitations of established assessments such as ceiling effects. For example, the Cognitive-Functional Composite, which combines items from existing assessments probing memory, executive function, and activities of daily living (ADLs), has fewer range restrictions compared to established cognitive assessments and therefore offers greater sensitivity to clinical progression.

### A systematic review of self and observer assessment of pain and related functioning in youth with brain-based developmental disabilities [^1148DBhT]. Pain (2024). Low credibility.

- **Self-report vs. observer-report**: Observer-report was predominant across articles, regardless of participant age, with approximately 50% of studies including solely observer-report. Despite its limitations, the development of standardized observer-report measures represents an important step toward decreasing inequities in pain research participation. Self-report of pain relies on complex mental processes often challenging for children younger than 6 years. However, it is critical to provide opportunities for adapted self-report (e.g. augmentative and alternative communication [AAC]) to recognize pain as a subjective experience and enable participation directly from youth. Although observer-report of pain can be helpful for youth who do not verbally communicate, an over-reliance on observer-report for chronic pain, in particular, may be problematic because behavioral signs tend to habituate or dissipate over time. von Baeyer and Spagrud (2007) described the diversity of pediatric observational pain scales available, including global behaviorally anchored rating scales, which list levels of pain (i.e. 0–5) and examples of specific behaviors for individuals. These scales were developed for pain assessment of children without disabilities, which consider individual baseline global behaviorally anchored behaviors in relation to pain.
