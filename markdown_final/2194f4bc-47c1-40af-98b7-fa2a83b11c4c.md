## Question

What are Bartholin cysts?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what Bartholin cysts are. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the normal anatomy and function of the Bartholin glands. Then, I should clarify the pathophysiology of ductal obstruction leading to cyst versus abscess. Next, I will review epidemiology and typical clinical features, followed by key differentials and red flags. After that, I should define the diagnostic approach, including when to image or biopsy. Finally, I will outline evidence-based management options and summarize complications and follow-up considerations, correcting any misconceptions along the way as needed.

> Let me first confirm the anatomy and function. The Bartholin (greater vestibular) glands are paired, pea-sized glands located at about the 4 and 8 o'clock positions of the posterior vestibule at the base of the labia minora, draining via short ducts into the vestibule and contributing to lubrication during sexual activity, which remains generally preserved even if one gland is removed due to other sources of vulvovaginal lubrication [^11365H2N] [^111VKYhp].

> I need to check the mechanism of cyst formation versus abscess. A Bartholin cyst forms when the duct is obstructed, leading to retained secretions and ductal dilation; if the obstructed duct or cyst becomes secondarily infected, a Bartholin abscess results, often polymicrobial with Enteric gram-negatives, with Escherichia coli commonly isolated and anaerobes also reported, which helps explain rapid onset tenderness and purulence in abscess states [^114jnBr6] [^111XZvUs] [^111VKYhp].

> Next, epidemiology and prevalence. Hold on, I should verify the lifetime risk: most sources place Bartholin duct cysts or abscesses at around 2% of women, predominantly of reproductive age, and incidental imaging series suggest small, asymptomatic cysts may be seen in roughly 3% of adult women on MRI, reinforcing that many lesions are clinically silent and benign [^11365H2N] [^113QyUuy].

> Now clinical features and size. Typical cysts are unilateral, soft, fluctuant swellings in the posterolateral vestibule measuring roughly 1–4 cm, often asymptomatic unless large, when they can cause fullness, dyspareunia, or localized discomfort; abscesses present with acute pain, erythema, and purulence consistent with infection dynamics and the microbiology above [^111VKYhp] [^114jnBr6]. Hmm, wait a minute — some radiologic reviews note "often bilateral"; but I should double-check the clinical norm: the standard presentation is unilateral in practice, so I will correct myself and anchor on unilateral as typical while acknowledging imaging descriptions that may variably describe laterality [^117JG9vc] [^111VKYhp].

> I will now consider the differential diagnosis and potential mimics. Epidermal inclusion cysts, Skene's duct (periurethral) cysts, hidradenoma papilliferum, lipomas, and urethral diverticulum are key considerations, and paraurethral or hymenal cysts, especially in neonates, generally self-resolve but can confuse the picture; location relative to the urethral meatus and vaginal introitus is critical in distinguishing Skene's and paraurethral lesions from Bartholin lesions, and in some scenarios lower urinary tract causes of outflow obstruction like Skene's cysts or diverticula must be kept in view to avoid misclassification [^113YkcUS] [^117JG9vc] [^112eZLQc].

> Next, I should review the diagnostic approach. Diagnosis is primarily clinical by characteristic location and exam, with ultrasound or MRI reserved for atypical, deep, recurrent, or diagnostically uncertain cases; in women aged 40 or older, or when lesions are solid, fixed, irregular, or otherwise atypical, biopsy or excision should be performed to exclude rare Bartholin gland malignancies, aligning with practice recommendations and cancer society guidance regarding appropriate staging workup if carcinoma is suspected [^111VKYhp] [^112hmjNP].

> Let me think about management in a stepwise fashion. Asymptomatic cysts can be observed; symptomatic cysts or abscesses are optimally treated with fistulization techniques such as Word catheter placement or with marsupialization to establish a durable drainage tract, with evidence suggesting similar recurrence and safety profiles between these approaches in abscess management, and emergency medicine literature consistently endorsing the effectiveness of Word catheters; simple incision and drainage alone is generally discouraged due to higher recurrence than catheterization or marsupialization, although general SSTI guidance recommends I&D for abscesses broadly — wait, hold on, I should clarify — Bartholin abscesses are a specific scenario where establishing a tract with a catheter or marsupialization reduces recurrence compared with I&D alone, so Bartholin-specific guidance prevails here [^1148ZAjq] [^11365H2N] [^111VKYhp] [^11365H2N] [^114AQV9v]. I should confirm the role of antibiotics: routine antibiotics are not required unless there is associated cellulitis, systemic illness, pregnancy, immunocompromise, or concern for STI; note that gonorrhea coinfection occurs in a minority of cases in ED cohorts, so STI testing is prudent when risk is present [^113YkcUS] [^111VKYhp] [^113YJeUL].

> But wait, what about alternative modalities and recurrence mitigation. Silver nitrate ablation and CO2 laser approaches have been studied with variable quality, including a randomized trial suggesting similar outcomes between marsupialization and silver nitrate and observational series of laser vaporization reporting high cure rates, yet these data are lower quality than the established office techniques; selection should be individualized for recurrent disease or when standard devices are unavailable, with acknowledgment of the evidence limits [^112Mf9kv] [^114yeb3s] [^111m5HjG].

> I should review complications and special situations. Recurrence does occur despite appropriate drainage, with comparable rates reported between Word catheter placement and marsupialization, and pregnancy-associated abscesses are uncommon but can rarely lead to systemic complications such as bacteremia and septic arthritis, underscoring the need for close follow-up in pregnant patients following drainage and appropriate antibiotic coverage when indicated [^114iBrvB] [^112nnVtC] [^1148ZAjq].

> In summary, Bartholin cysts are benign retention cysts from ductal obstruction of the Bartholin glands, most often unilateral in the posterolateral vestibule and frequently asymptomatic; evaluation is clinical with imaging or biopsy reserved for atypical or older patients, and management hinges on creating a durable drainage tract via Word catheter or marsupialization rather than simple incision alone, with selective antibiotic use and vigilance for malignancy in women aged 40 or older or with irregular masses [^111VKYhp] [^11365H2N] [^112hmjNP].

---

Bartholin cysts are fluid-filled swellings from duct obstruction, often asymptomatic but sometimes causing discomfort or dyspareunia [^111VKYhp]. They are managed based on symptoms: **asymptomatic cysts require no treatment** and can be observed [^11365H2N], while symptomatic or recurrent cysts are best treated with **Word catheter or marsupialization** [^114iBrvB]; excision is reserved for persistent or suspicious lesions. Antibiotics are only needed if infection is present [^114AQV9v]. Recurrence is **common**, so patient education and follow-up are important [^111VKYhp].

---

## Etiology and pathophysiology

Bartholin cysts result from **duct obstruction**, which causes retention of secretions and cyst formation [^117JG9vc]. Obstruction may result from inflammation, infection, or trauma [^111VKYhp]. Common pathogens associated with infected cysts (Bartholin abscesses) include Escherichia coli [^114jnBr6], Staphylococcus aureus, and anaerobic bacteria such as Bacteroides species [^111XZvUs].

---

## Clinical presentation

Bartholin cysts typically present as painless, **unilateral swellings** at the posterior aspect of the vaginal introitus [^111VKYhp]. They are usually asymptomatic [^113QyUuy] but may cause discomfort, dyspareunia, or difficulty walking if they enlarge significantly. Infection produces a Bartholin abscess, characterized by acute pain, erythema, swelling, and sometimes systemic symptoms such as fever [^1148ZAjq].

---

## Diagnosis

Diagnosis is **primarily clinical** [^111VKYhp], based on physical examination findings of a fluctuant, non-tender mass at the posterior vaginal introitus. Imaging studies such as ultrasound or MRI may be used for atypical cases or when malignancy is suspected, particularly in women over 40 years [^117JG9vc].

---

## Differential diagnosis

The **differential diagnosis** for Bartholin cysts includes [^111VKYhp]:

- Gartner duct cysts
- Skene gland cysts
- Epidermal inclusion cysts
- Vulvar abscesses
- Vulvar malignancies

---

## Management

Management of Bartholin cysts depends on the presence of symptoms, infection, and patient preference [^111VKYhp]. Asymptomatic cysts may be managed conservatively with observation and sitz baths. Symptomatic or recurrent cysts **require surgical intervention** [^1148ZAjq].

---

### Surgical interventions

- **Word catheter placement**: A minimally invasive office procedure involving incision and insertion of a Word catheter to allow continuous drainage and epithelialization of the duct [^11365H2N]. Recurrence rates are approximately 10–15% [^114iBrvB].
- **Marsupialization**: Surgical creation of a permanent opening by suturing the cyst wall to the vaginal mucosa [^11365H2N]. Recurrence rates are approximately 5–10% [^114iBrvB].
- **Excision**: Complete removal of the gland and cyst, reserved for recurrent or persistent cysts. Recurrence rates are lower but associated with higher morbidity [^111VKYhp].

---

### Antibiotic therapy

Antibiotics are indicated **only when infection is present**, typically in the case of a Bartholin abscess [^111VKYhp]. Empiric antibiotic therapy should cover common pathogens, including anaerobes and gram-negative bacteria [^114jnBr6] [^111XZvUs].

---

## Complications

Potential **complications** of Bartholin cysts include:

- Infection leading to abscess formation
- Recurrence of cysts or abscesses
- Rarely, malignancy (Bartholin gland carcinoma), particularly in women over 40 years of age [^111VKYhp] [^112hmjNP]

---

## Recurrence and prevention

Recurrence is **common**, occurring in **approximately 10–15%** of cases [^114iBrvB] [^11365H2N]. Preventive measures include maintaining good perineal hygiene, prompt treatment of infections, and regular follow-up care [^111VKYhp].

---

## Prognosis

The prognosis for Bartholin cysts is **generally excellent**, with most cases resolving with appropriate management. Recurrence is common but can be managed effectively with repeat interventions [^111VKYhp].

---

Bartholin cysts are **common benign lesions** resulting from obstruction of the Bartholin gland duct [^117JG9vc]. They are typically asymptomatic but can cause discomfort or infection. Management depends on symptoms and patient preference, with surgical interventions such as Word catheter placement or marsupialization being effective treatment options [^111VKYhp] [^114iBrvB].

### Abscess management: An evidence-based review for emergency medicine clinicians [^1148ZAjq]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Abscesses are commonly evaluated and managed in the emergency department. Recent research has evaluated the use of ultrasonography, packing, incision and drainage (I&D), and antibiotics. There are evidence-based nuances to the management of specific types of abscesses, such as Bartholin, breast, dental, hidradenitis suppurativa, peritonsillar, and pilonidal abscesses.

- **Objective**: This review provides emergency medicine clinicians with a summary of the literature regarding abscess management in the emergency department.

- **Discussion**: Ultrasound is valuable in diagnosing abscesses that are not clinically evident and in guiding I&D procedures. Although I&D is traditionally followed by packing, this practice may be unnecessary for small abscesses. Antibiotics, needle aspiration, and loop drainage are suitable alternatives to I&D of abscesses with certain characteristics. Oral antibiotics can improve outcomes after I&D, although this improvement must be weighed against potential risks.

	- Many strategies are useful in managing Bartholin abscesses, with the Word catheter proving consistently effective. Needle aspiration is the recommended first-line therapy for small breast abscesses. Dental abscesses are often diagnosed with clinical examination alone, but ultrasound may be a useful adjunct. Acute abscess formation caused by hidradenitis suppurativa should be managed surgically by excision when possible, because I&D has a high rate of abscess recurrence. Peritonsillar abscesses can be diagnosed with either intraoral or transcervical ultrasound if clinical examination suggests their presence.

### Vulvar squamous cell carcinoma complicating hidradenitis suppurativa in a young woman [^116bXtLb]. JAAD Case Reports (2019). Low credibility.

Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a chronic and inflammatory skin follicular disease affecting the apocrine gland-bearing areas of the body. It is characterized by painful nodules, cysts, and abscesses that can rupture and lead to the formation of sinus tracts and scarring. The most common HS locations are the axillary, inguinal, and anogenital regions. Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is an uncommon complication of this disease, with fewer than 100 cases reported in the literature. We describe the case of a young woman presenting with a vulvar SCC complicating an HS.

### Management of lacrimal sac abscesses using lacrimal probe and Crawford silicon tube [^1175Say7]. BMC Ophthalmology (2016). Low credibility.

The challenges in treating lacrimal sac abscesses are well known. Surgical intervention by means of incision and drainage (I&D) has been the gold standard of treatment. However, skin incisions can cause scarring and have the potential for inducing cicatricial ectropion. These modalities may also lead to persistent lacrimal sac-cutaneous fistulas. More troublesome is that after I&D, a definitive treatment, such as dacryocystorhinostomy (DCR), is required, meaning patients undergo surgery twice. The external scars seen in I&D are absent with other approaches, making them cosmetically superior and functionally better, as the lacrimal pump remains intact since the orbicularis oculi muscle is not incised.

Basic treatment principles for lacrimal sac abscesses may include controlling infections, maintaining drainage of the lacrimal sac, and eliminating the abscess cavity. The concept of treating lacrimal sac abscesses by proceeding with lacrimal duct intubation originated from a patient suggestion. The patient insisted on avoiding an incision on the abscess. We consulted various related literatures and found that dacryocystorhinostomy can be used to achieve internal drainage under a nasal endoscope. Consequently, we designed a scheme to treat acute dacryocystitis with canalicular intubation to realize internal drainage. We probed the lacrimal system to drain the lacrimal sac abscess and performed Crawford tube insertions to maintain the drainage and eliminate the abscess cavity.

Most lesions of the Bartholin gland are cysts or abscesses. Clinicians are taught that lesions of the Bartholin gland occurring in older women should raise the differential diagnosis of malignancy, although these are uncommon. A variety of more unusual and rare lesions of the Bartholin gland have been reported. This review focuses on these less common entities, which must be considered as well when encountering pathology of the Bartholin gland.

### The management of intra-abdominal infections from a global perspective: 2017 WSES guidelines for management of intra-abdominal infections [^113AzVzP]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

On the basis of clinical conditions, patients with diverticular smaller abscesses may be treated by antibiotics alone (Recommendation 1C). Patients with abscesses having a large diameter should be treated by percutaneous drainage and intravenous antibiotics (Recommendation 1C). Whenever percutaneous drainage of the abscess is not feasible or available, based on clinical conditions, patients with large abscesses can be initially treated by antibiotic therapy alone. However, careful clinical monitoring is mandatory (Recommendation 1C).

Approximately 15–20% of patients admitted with ALCD have an abscess, and the treatment should be either antibiotics with or without percutaneous and/or surgical drainage. The use of antibiotics and percutaneous drainage in the management of diverticular abscesses facilitates a single-stage operation to perform subsequently an elective sigmoidectomy. The size of 3–6 cm has been generally accepted, despite the low level of evidence, to be a reasonable limit between antimicrobial versus percutaneous drainage in the management of diverticular abscesses.

A retrospective study assessing the effectiveness of antibiotics as sole initial therapy in patients with large diverticular abscess was published in 2015 by Elagili et al. Thirty-two patients were managed by antibiotics alone while 114 underwent percutaneous drainage. Failure of initial treatment required urgent surgery in eight patients with persistent symptoms during treatment with antibiotics alone (25%) and in 21 patients (18%) after initial percutaneous drainage (p = 0.21).

### Paraurethral cyst in female newborn: Is surgery always advocated [^116J7T1n]? Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Paraurethral cysts in females are rare, particularly in the neonatal period. Only 49 cases have been previously reported in English literature. The choice of management for this lesion remains controversial. Surgical management has been advocated, but spontaneous regression has also been reported. The aim of the study was to clarify the natural course of paraurethral cysts in female neonates and discuss the proper choice of treatment.

- **Patients and methods**: Neonates who presented to our surgical unit with paraurethral cyst over a 5-year period (January 2000 through December 2005) were studied. The "nonoperative strategy" was indicated, and their clinical course and outcomes were examined.

- **Results**: Five consecutive patients with paraurethral cysts in female neonates were treated. During the same period, there were 5192 female births, and the incidence of paraurethral cyst was 1 in 1038 female births. None was associated with other anomalies. Clinical examination revealed an interlabial cystic mass, which was spherical and yellowish in color, with dilated blood vessels on the anterior surface. It obscured both the urethral meatus and the vaginal orifice. However, there was no apparent voiding difficulty. These paraurethral cysts spontaneously disappeared at follow-up 76 to 304 days after birth.

- **Conclusion**: Our data suggest that the number of reported cases, being fewer than predicted, indicates that paraurethral cysts in female neonates are often unrecognized. Paraurethral cysts are generally characterized by a completely asymptomatic lesion and have a high rate of spontaneous resolution.

### Congenital paraurethral cysts in two newborn girls: Differential diagnosis, management strategies, and spontaneous resolution [^117YVGyP]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2012). Low credibility.

At least five types of interlabial masses of different etiologies may present in a female neonate. The more serious type of interlabial mass must be differentiated from the benign and self-resolving paraurethral or hymenal cyst. Clues include appearance and color of the mass and the location of the mass in relation to the urethral meatus and the vaginal opening. Clinicians should be able to distinguish lesions that require aggressive intervention, such as surgery, from those that self-resolve and merely require observation.

- **Case**: Two unrelated newborn girls each had a protruding faint-yellow-colored spherical interlabial cyst. The cyst was located anterior to the vaginal orifice and partially obscured the urethral meatus. Neither girl had any voiding problems. No other congenital anomalies were detected. Both cysts resolved rapidly and completely without surgical intervention.

- **Summary and conclusion**: Paraurethral cysts of the newborn and hymenal cysts rarely cause urinary obstruction or spotting, and are self-resolving. When positively identified, no evaluation of the upper urinary tract is required and neither aspiration of cyst contents nor a marsupialization procedure is necessary.

### United Kingdom national guideline for the management of pelvic inflammatory disease (2019 interim update) [^1135bHcE]. BASHH (2019). High credibility.

The BASHH 2019 guidelines recommend administering intravenous antibiotic therapy to patients with pelvic inflammatory disease who display signs of tubo-ovarian abscess or pelvic peritonitis. This is particularly emphasized in cases involving intra-abdominal abscesses, specifically with regard to patients with tubo-ovarian abscesses.

### Myxoid leiomyosarcoma of the Bartholin gland [^112axg9L]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2014). Low credibility.

Myxoid leiomyosarcomas originating from the Bartholin gland are exceedingly rare. Only one other case of a Bartholin gland myxoid leiomyosarcoma has been reported.

- **Case**: Our patient presented with a 10 cm mass on her vulva, which was presumed to be a Bartholin gland cyst. Pathology showed a high-grade myxoid leiomyosarcoma with positive margins. She was treated with left radical hemivulvectomy, laparoscopic hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, and six cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy. She is now 1 year from completion of therapy and remains disease-free.

- **Conclusion**: All solid vulvar masses should be thoroughly evaluated with a low threshold for biopsy. Treatment should consist of complete resection. Hormonal manipulation, chemotherapy, and radiation should be considered as potential adjuvant treatment options.

### Congenital megaureter presenting in an adult as a vaginal wall cyst [^116vZj9b]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2016). Low credibility.

Vaginal cysts are a common finding. The differential diagnosis includes epidermal inclusion, Bartholin gland, Gartner duct, and Skene gland cysts, as well as Müllerian anomalies. Rarely, leiomyomas, cancers, or ectopic ureters, such as megaureters, are found.

- **Case**: A 31-year-old woman, gravida 3 para 3, presented with a 12-year history of intermittent abdominal pain and involuntary loss of urine. She was diagnosed with an ectopic vaginal megaureter after evaluation and subsequently underwent a nephroureterectomy with a marsupialized distal ureter. She remains asymptomatic.

- **Conclusion**: Consideration of a rare diagnosis such as an ectopic ureter is important when patients repeatedly present with involuntary urinary incontinence in conjunction with a vaginal cyst and an otherwise negative evaluation. Using magnetic resonance imaging can be useful to assess urinary tract involvement, particularly in patients with known urinary tract malformations.

### Stage IV carcinoma of the Bartholin gland managed with primary chemoradiation [^112M55pp]. Gynecologic Oncology (2002). Low credibility.

Optimal management of carcinoma of the Bartholin gland is not yet defined. Patients with locally advanced disease have historically been managed by radical and, occasionally, exenterative surgery. Although the management of advanced vulvar cancer has shifted toward conservative management with primary chemoradiation, there is limited information on a similar approach to the management of advanced Bartholin's gland carcinoma.

- **Case**: We present a woman with stage IVA basaloid squamous carcinoma of the Bartholin gland. She was managed with primary chemoradiation to spare her the morbidity associated with exenterative surgery. We discuss a rationale for the use of chemoradiation in advanced Bartholin's gland carcinoma.

- **Conclusion**: Conservative management of advanced carcinoma of the Bartholin gland with primary chemoradiation may be appropriate while sparing patients the sequelae of exenterative surgery.

### The management of ovarian cysts in postmenopausal women [^115cLGRQ]. RCOG (2016). High credibility.

The RCOG 2016 guidelines recommend that for postmenopausal patients undergoing surgical management of ovarian cysts, the surgical specimen should be removed without intraperitoneal spillage using a laparoscopic retrieval bag via the umbilical port. If the surgeon possesses the necessary expertise, consider performing transvaginal extraction of the specimen.

### Adenoid cystic carcinoma of the Bartholin's gland: Report of two cases and review of the literature [^113t9UFz]. Gynecologic Oncology (2006). Low credibility.

Adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) of the Bartholin's gland is a rare malignancy of the female genital tract. There have been 62 cases of ACC of the Bartholin's gland reported in the literature.

- **Cases**: Two cases of ACC of the Bartholin's gland are reported.

- **Conclusion**: There is no consensus on the optimal treatment of ACC of the Bartholin's gland. Most commonly, wide local excision and radical vulvectomy, with or without lymph node dissection, are performed. More long-term follow-up is recommended to evaluate the optimal primary treatment and the roles of radiotherapy and chemotherapy because ACC of the Bartholin's gland can recur and metastasize long after primary treatment.

### Rectovaginal fistula as a complication to a Bartholin gland excision [^1172gwxs]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2011). Low credibility.

Rectovaginal fistula is a rare complication of inflammatory bowel disease, obstetric trauma, pelvic surgery, radiation, and trauma. We present a rectovaginal fistula occurring after an excision of a Bartholin gland.

- **Case**: A healthy 43-year-old woman presented with flatus per vagina immediately following a Bartholin gland excision. She had a history of Bartholin abscess and had undergone multiple incision and drainage procedures of this cyst over the past 6 years. On rectovaginal examination, the patient was found to have a rectovaginal fistula and subsequently underwent successful transvaginal repair.

- **Conclusion**: Rectovaginal fistula can occur after excision of a Bartholin gland. This case report illustrates a rare and serious complication of a commonly performed gynecologic procedure.

### CO2 laser therapy of the Bartholin's gland cyst: Surgical data and functional short- and long-term results [^113mp92h]. Journal of Minimally Invasive Gynecology (2007). Low credibility.

The Bartholin's gland cyst is a condition that occurs in approximately 2% of women, most of whom are of reproductive age. Although benign, it is associated with significant patient discomfort. Definitive treatment involves the surgical removal of the entire cyst. The objective of this study was to describe an alternative conservative surgical technique with CO2 laser adopted in our institution and to evaluate the feasibility, complication rate, and results obtained with this technique in an office setting. Our study showed that CO2 laser treatment of the Bartholin's gland cyst can be carried out safely in an outpatient setting, with minimum patient discomfort and high long-term cure rates.

### Endometriosis MR mimickers: T1-hyperintense lesions [^117JG9vc]. Insights into Imaging (2024). Low credibility.

Bartholin's glands, or greater vestibular glands, arise in the superficial perineal pouch of the urogenital triangle. When the ducts of these glands become obstructed, it leads to retention of secretions and the formation of cysts. Bartholin's gland cysts are the most common type of vulvar cysts, mostly ranging in size from 1 to 4 cm. While many patients with Bartholin's gland cysts are asymptomatic, some may experience mild dyspareunia during vaginal penetration, which needs to be differentiated from deep dyspareunia associated with endometriosis. It is important to note that the specific anatomical location of these cysts on the posterolateral surface of the vestibule, often occurring bilaterally, should not be mistaken for cystic endometriotic implants in patients with a history of vaginal delivery (with or without episiotomy) or prior transvaginal surgeries. On imaging, Bartholin's gland cysts with high proteinaceous content exhibit high signal intensity on T1-weighted imaging, along with heterogeneous and low signal intensity on T2-weighted imaging.

Skene's glands, or periurethral glands, are tubule-alveolar structures located at the 3 and 9 o'clock positions along the distal two-thirds of the urethra, providing lubrication. These are typically round and unilocular fluid-filled cysts. Homogeneous T1-hyperintensity, suggesting high proteinaceous content, can help in their detection and physical examination identification. It is essential to differentiate these cysts from urethral diverticulum.

### Management of suspected ovarian masses in premenopausal women [^116Ttdcg]. RCOG (2011). High credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for ovarian cysts, more specifically with respect to surveillance imaging, BSGE/RCOG 2011 guidelines recommend obtaining annual ultrasound surveillance in patients with simple ovarian cysts of 5–7 cm in diameter. Consider either obtaining further imaging (MRI) or offering surgical intervention in patients with larger simple cysts.

### Multimodality approach to the nipple-areolar complex: a pictorial review and diagnostic algorithm [^116yGeVS]. Insights into Imaging (2020). Low credibility.

Retroareolar cysts in adolescents are caused by the obstruction and dilation of the terminal ducts that drain the Montgomery glands. They can occur unilaterally or bilaterally, with two main clinical types: inflammatory (more common) and asymptomatic. The inflammatory type presents as a palpable nodule associated with erythema and pain, while the asymptomatic type presents as a palpable nodule without inflammatory signs or symptoms. Occasionally, these cysts are associated with serous nipple discharge.

Ultrasound is the technique of choice for both the initial assessment and follow-up. It shows one or more fine-walled oval cystic lesions measuring less than 20 mm. Inflammatory cysts can contain debris, levels or septa, and increased peripheral Doppler signal. These cysts can be difficult to distinguish from a retroareolar abscess, but time helps; whereas retroareolar cysts have a benign clinical course and respond rapidly to oral antibiotics and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, abscesses require drainage. Symptomatic retroareolar cysts should be followed up for at least 7 days after initiating treatment to confirm the resolution of the lesion or a decrease in size, while asymptomatic cysts resolve spontaneously, although ultrasound follow-up is recommended.

### Novel technique for management of Bartholin gland cysts and abscesses [^111pNKcd]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Definitive methods for the treatment of a Bartholin cyst and abscess include the placement of a Word catheter, marsupialization, application of silver nitrate, and surgical excision. Placement of a Word catheter is the most frequently employed technique for office and emergency department (ED) management. However, many institutions do not have the Word catheter available; in addition, the catheter tends to dislodge before epithelialization, leading to a recurrence of the cyst.

- **Objective**: We have developed a simple technique for the management of Bartholin gland abscess or cyst using readily available materials. This technique involves using a small loop of plastic tubing, which is secured to prevent expulsion before epithelialization of a drainage tract.

- **Case report**: A 25-year-old woman presented to the ED with a Bartholin gland abscess. After administration of local anesthetic, a loop of tubing was placed, allowing for drainage of the abscess. The patient was discharged home with a course of oral antibiotics. At a 3-week follow-up, the Bartholin gland abscess was found to be healed; the device was removed without difficulty, leaving two drainage tracts.

- **Conclusion**: This technique may be used as an alternative to the placement of a Word catheter for the management of Bartholin gland abscess or cyst.

### Surgical treatment of Bartholin's gland abscess: Is Word catheter superior to marsupialization [^114iBrvB]. Journal of Minimally Invasive Gynecology (2021). Low credibility.

Bartholin's gland abscess may occur in up to 2% of women. Surgical drainage using the Word catheter application or marsupialization is the treatment of choice in managing Bartholin's gland abscess. We aimed to compare the abscess recurrence rates between these two surgical methods.

The study was designed as a retrospective cohort database study set in a university-affiliated, high-volume teaching hospital in southern Israel. It included all women who were surgically treated for Bartholin's gland abscess. Various clinical and postoperative characteristics were retrieved from the patients' records, and a univariate analysis was conducted, with a p-value of less than .05 considered significant.

During the study period, 321 women were admitted to our center with Bartholin's gland abscess and were managed surgically. Among these, 215 (67%) were treated using the Word catheter and 106 (33%) by drainage and marsupialization. No differences were found in clinical and microbiologic features between the study groups. Additionally, recurrence rates and readmissions did not differ significantly, and postoperative complications were similar between the groups.

Our study reassures that both the Word catheter application and marsupialization are appropriate and safe when treating Bartholin's gland abscess.

- **Subareolar abscess**: Also known as "Zuska's disease", this condition is characterized by a subcutaneous abscess in the subareolar location due to aseptic inflammation caused by squamous metaplasia, which is secondary to obstruction of lactiferous ducts. Physical examination findings include mastalgia, nipple discharge, inflammatory signs, and a tender subareolar breast lump. Fistulas can be observed in chronic cases. Diagnosis typically requires clinical history and physical examination, as imaging findings may mimic malignancy or gynecomastia. Mammography is challenging due to pain associated with breast compression. When performed, imaging may reveal skin thickening, distortion, and an ill-defined subareolar mass accompanied by trabecular thickening. Sonographic imaging findings present as a "heterogeneous, irregular, hypoechoic mass" or "fluid collection with internal echoes, and irregular walls". Increased vascularity in surrounding tissues, thickening of skin due to inflammation, and fistulous tract formation may also be present.

- **Idiopathic and specific granulomatous mastitis**: These are rare chronic inflammatory male breast diseases characterized by non-caseating granulomatous lobulitis. They may clinically and radiologically mimic breast cancer. The etiology of idiopathic granulomatous mastitis is unclear, while specific granulomatous mastitis usually has identifiable causes such as tuberculosis, Wegener's granulomatosis, vasculitis, sarcoidosis, foreign body reaction, syphilis, corynebacterial infection, and fungal and parasitic infections.

### The Bartholin gland cyst: past, present, and future [^111m5HjG]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2004). Low credibility.

Bartholin gland cysts account for 2% of all gynecologic visits per year. The treatment of Bartholin gland cysts has evolved from a complicated, bloody procedure requiring general anesthesia to, most recently, a simple puncture of the cyst and placement of a drain performed in the office. Although treatments for Bartholin gland cysts seem simple on the surface, differentiating between cysts and diagnosing simple cysts versus abscesses versus malignant tumors can complicate treatment for this common problem.

This article examines the history of the treatment of Bartholin gland cysts, including traditional treatments such as excision, fistulization, and marsupialization, as well as cauterization with carbon dioxide laser and silver nitrate. Modern variations are discussed, including the use of hydrodissection for excision and the application of magnetic resonance imaging in devising treatment for recurrent cysts.

### Bartholin gland carcinoma in a young female: A rare disease in an unusual age group [^112bZtiY]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

Primary Bartholin gland carcinoma (BGC) is an extremely rare disease, typically presenting in elderly women. It can be confused with a Bartholin gland cyst, a benign condition that may lead to delays in diagnosis and treatment. We present a case report of BGC in a 35-year-old woman, which has created both a diagnostic and therapeutic dilemma.

### Stage I carcinoma of the Bartholin's gland managed with the detection of inguinal and pelvic sentinel lymph node [^1142V8vU]. Gynecologic Oncology (2009). Low credibility.

Primary carcinoma of the Bartholin's gland is rare; consequently, standard management is not clear. Although the sentinel concept has gained popularity for other malignancies of the female reproductive tract, the literature lacks reports of this approach for carcinomas of the Bartholin's gland.

- **Case**: We present a patient with stage I adenocarcinoma of the Bartholin's gland. She was managed with broad excision and inguinal and laparoscopic pelvic sentinel lymphadenectomy followed by complete pelvic lymphadenectomy. We discuss the rationale for the sentinel concept.

- **Conclusion**: As for other gynaecological malignancies, the sentinel lymphadenectomy seems to be an appropriate and feasible surgical approach for early-stage carcinomas of the Bartholin's gland.

- **Foreign body and obstruction**: Urethral foreign body, ureterocele, urolithiasis
- **Oncological causes**: Cervical cancer, uterine cancer, muscle-invasive bladder cancer
- **Other anatomical abnormalities**: Meatal stenosis, uterine fibroids
- **Prostate-related**: Benign prostatic hyperplasia

### Ranula: Current concept of pathophysiologic basis and surgical management options [^1147uvEK]. World Journal of Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

There is no consensus on the definitive management of these lesions, and significant variation in practice exists. Multiple options are available, including surveillance, needle aspiration, surgical excision of the cyst, sublingual gland excision along with the cyst, marsupialization, sclerotherapy, laser excision, or cryosurgery. Sclerotherapy involves the use of bleomycin — an antineoplastic antibiotic from *Streptomyces verticillus* — and OK-432 (Picibanil), a lyophilized mixture of a low-virulence strain of *Streptococcus pyogenes* incubated with benzyl penicillin, which has been found effective. In antenatally diagnosed lesions, where the oral mass can be life-threatening, Kolker et al. described the ex utero intrapartum treatment (the EXIT technique).

Different outcomes have been reported with each approach, each having varying complications. Recurrence is frequently mentioned as a major issue, with different scholars advocating for the excision of either the ranula alone, the ranula with the sublingual gland, or the ranula with the submandibular gland. This demonstrates that the etiopathogenesis of ranulas is not yet fully understood.

Scientific knowledge suggests that ranulas originate primarily from the sublingual salivary gland, which spontaneously secretes saliva without parasympathetic stimulation, such as during feeding. This saliva is drained by 6–20 ducts scattered in the floor of the oral cavity, known as the ducts of Rivinus. These ducts are located mostly at the posterior and superior aspects, while at the anterior part, they coalesce into a single duct.

### Open or laparoscopic treatment for hydatid disease of the liver? A 10-year single-institution experience [^114GVhg1]. Surgical Endoscopy (2013). Low credibility.

Postoperative morbidity in group 1 (laparoscopic approach)

Group 1 had two abscesses of the residual cavity and four cases of external biliary fistulas. The hydatid cysts developing the two abscesses of the remaining cavity were medium-sized and located in segments 8 and 3. Both abscesses were laparoscopically drained. Of the four hydatid cysts with postoperative development of biliary fistulas, only one was intraoperatively diagnosed as abscessed. The remaining three hepatic cysts were acephalocyst (with pure clear cyst fluid) or cysts with daughter vesicles. No biliocystic communication was detected intraoperatively in any of the cases. The flow of the four biliary fistulas significantly decreased after intestinal transit resumption, but they closed spontaneously in only two cases. The remaining two cases needed ERCP with endoscopic sphincterotomy, which accomplished closure of the biliary fistulas in 7–10 days.

- **Postoperative morbidity in group 2 (conventional approach)**: Most of the surgical complications in group 2 were wound complications (seromas, suppuration: 8.72%, 15 cases) and biliary fistulas (4.65%, 8 cases). Wound complications (seromas or suppuration of the wound) required removal of two or three cutaneous stitches and collection evacuation followed by daily antiseptic treatment, with a favorable evolution. Most of the patients (6 cases) who experienced postoperative biliary fistula were treated conservatively. The amount of bile drained through the drain tubes from the remaining cavity decreased dramatically after bowel transit resumption, with complete closure following shortly thereafter.

### Minimally invasive and inexpensive percutaneous abscess drainage using an indwelling needle cannula [^116rBnYb]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2020). Low credibility.

Abscess is still a formidable disease and requires adequate drainage. Moreover, drainage in the head and neck area needs cosmetic care, especially in the pediatric population. In this report, we introduce our method of percutaneous abscess drainage using an indwelling needle cannula.

Ten pediatric and five adult patients with cervical and/or facial abscess treated with this drainage method were retrospectively reviewed. Using an indwelling needle cannula (18–14 G Surflow®, Terumo, Tokyo, Japan), abscesses were penetrated under ultrasonic examination. Once purulent retention was identified, the inner metal needle was removed, and the outer elastic needle was left and fixed. The outer needle was connected to the tube for continuous suction drainage for large abscesses.

The primary diseases of these abscesses were cervical abscess of dental origin (5), purulent lymphadenitis (3), pyriform sinus fistula (2), subperiosteal abscess due to mastoiditis (2), circumorbital cellulitis (1), infection of Warthin's tumor (1), and unknown origin (1). The median (range) duration of drainage was 4 days (3–9 days). Abscesses were successfully treated, and no patients required an additional incision for abscess drainage. No apparent scars after drainage were observed.

This technique resembles the usual venous placement of an indwelling needle cannula and is thought to be familiar to physicians. Although simple and inexpensive, this drainage is safe, effective, and minimally invasive for the treatment of abscess.

### Chorioamnionitis and sternoclavicular septic arthritis after drainage of Bartholin gland abscess [^112nnVtC]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2014). Low credibility.

Complications after drainage of Bartholin gland abscesses in pregnancy are rare.

- **Case**: A 29-year-old primigravid at 35 weeks of gestation with dichorionic-diamniotic twins underwent Bartholin gland abscess drainage. Afterward, she reported shoulder pain and became febrile. Examination revealed maternal and fetal tachycardia with abdominal tenderness consistent with chorioamnionitis, and she underwent delivery. Blood cultures grew Escherichia coli, and antibiotics were begun. Her shoulder pain worsened, and examination demonstrated inflammation over the sternoclavicular joint. Fluid aspirate of this joint grew E. coli. She experienced improvement after aspiration and was discharged home on antibiotics.

- **Conclusion**: Although rare, severe consequences can result from Bartholin gland abscesses in pregnant patients, including sepsis and septic arthritis. Close clinical follow-up should be considered in pregnant patients undergoing abscess drainage.

### Carbon-dioxide laser vaporization of the Bartholin gland cyst: a retrospective analysis on 200 cases [^114yeb3s]. Journal of Minimally Invasive Gynecology (2008). Low credibility.

The study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of carbon-dioxide laser vaporization as a definitive treatment for Bartholin gland cysts. This retrospective analysis was classified under the Canadian Task Force classification II-3 and conducted at a university teaching hospital.

The analysis included a consecutive series of 200 patients with either unilateral or bilateral Bartholin gland cysts. The intervention involved a standardized technique of cyst vaporization using a carbon-dioxide laser performed in an outpatient setting under local anesthesia.

Records were reviewed for patient history, anatomic parameters, intraoperative and postoperative outcomes, and follow-up data. Among these, seven patients with bilateral cysts were treated in a single session, resulting in a total of 207 procedures. The average cyst size measured 6.3 ± 2.3 cm (95% CI 5.93–6.67). All treatments were completed in an outpatient setting with local anesthesia, featuring a median operative time of 17 minutes (range: 7–45). There were three instances (1.5%) of significant intraoperative bleeding. The cure rate for a single laser treatment stood at 95.7%. Nine patients who experienced recurrence during follow-up underwent subsequent carbon-dioxide laser interventions using the same therapeutic strategy, achieving a 100% cure rate after two or three treatments.

In conclusion, carbon-dioxide laser vaporization of Bartholin gland cysts is a safe and effective procedure with comprehensive healing and favorable follow-up outcomes. Further randomized trials are necessary to confirm these findings and establish the best surgical strategy.

### Placement of a Word catheter: A resident training model [^114TdGEw]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2005).

The present study developed and evaluated a practical teaching model and training protocol for Word catheter placement in the treatment of a Bartholin gland cyst.

- **Study design**: Residents were asked to treat a model of the female perineum, fashioned from harvested porcine tissue, with a simulated Bartholin cyst via Word catheter placement and drainage. Each resident was evaluated for procedural competence. They were retested after viewing a continuous 59-second video demonstrating catheter placement.

- **Results**: The model's resemblance to female genitalia was confirmed by 68% of residents. Correct diagnosis and treatment of a Bartholin gland cyst was made by 61%. The mean pretraining score was 5.5 ± 1.46, while the post-training average was 8.2 ± 1.20, indicating an approximate 58% increase in resident proficiency (P < .05).

- **Conclusion**: A model of the female perineum fashioned from harvested porcine tissue is a suitable instructional aid in the recognition and treatment of a Bartholin cyst. Proficiency in Word catheter placement is improved through the use of the model and instructional video.

### Clinical and microbiological characteristics of Bartholin gland abscesses [^114jnBr6]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2013). Low credibility.

To examine the clinical course and causative microorganisms of Bartholin gland abscesses, this retrospective study included all patients treated for these abscesses between 2006 and 2011 at the Soroka University Medical Center, a regional medical center in southern Israel. During the study period, 219 women were admitted due to a Bartholin gland abscess, with 63% being primary abscesses and 37% reoccurrences (occurrence of a second clinical event).

Pus cultures were positive in 126 cases (61.8%). Escherichia coli was the single most frequently found pathogen (43.7%), and 10 cases (7.9%) were polymicrobial. Culture-positive cases were significantly associated with fever (25% compared with 9.3%; p = 0.043), leukocytosis (50.4% compared with 33.8%; p = 0.027), and neutrophilia (17.9% compared with 5.9%; p = 0.021). The odds ratio of having any of these symptoms with a positive culture was 2.4 (95% confidence interval 1.3–4.3; p = 0.003).

In the recurrence group, 81% recurred ipsilaterally, and the mean time for recurrence was 32 ± 50 months. Infection with E. coli was significantly more common in recurrences compared with primary infections (56.8% compared with 37%; p = 0.033). Three cases showed resistance to most beta-lactam antimicrobials, involving extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing E. coli strains.

In conclusion, a substantial proportion of patients with Bartholin gland abscesses are culture-positive, with E. coli being the single most common pathogen.

### Adenoid cystic carcinoma of the Bartholin gland: An overview [^113bdaKB]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Vulvar carcinoma is the fourth most frequently encountered malignancy of the female reproductive tract. Among vulvar neoplasms, 0.1% to 5% are of Bartholin gland origin. Primary adenoid cystic carcinoma of the Bartholin gland is very rare; at the time of writing, only about 60 cases have been reported in the world literature. Microscopic examination reveals a neoplasm of cribriform pattern composed of nests and columns of cells of bland appearance arranged concentrically around gland-like spaces filled with eosinophilic periodic acid-Schiff-positive diastase-resistant material. Immunohistochemically, the tumor cells express low-molecular-weight keratins, carcinoembryonic antigen, lysozyme, alpha1-antichymotrypsin, S100, and type IV collagen.

Adenoid cystic carcinoma of the Bartholin gland is a slow-growing but locally very aggressive neoplasm with a high capacity for recurrence. Perineural and lymphatic invasion is characteristic of this tumor and may explain its propensity for causing pain and recurrence. The treatment may range from simple local excision to radical vulvectomy, with or without partial to complete regional lymphadenectomy.

### Complex cystic liver lesions: Classification, diagnosis, and management [^116pE379]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2024). Low credibility.

Pyogenic liver abscesses develop secondary to ascending cholangitis, hematogenous dissemination, or pylephlebitis following intra-abdominal infections such as acute appendicitis or diverticulitis. The incidence is higher in middle-aged or elderly patients, who present with low-grade evening fever, right upper quadrant pain, fatigue, tender hepatomegaly, and elevated white blood cell count.

Infectious abscesses on contrast-enhanced CT demonstrate a peripherally enhancing rim surrounding a central low attenuation area, with an outer low attenuation zone due to perilesional parenchymal edema, producing the characteristic "double target" sign. The presence of gas within an abscess strongly indicates gas-producing species. Treatment options for pyogenic liver abscesses include antibiotic therapy and percutaneous or open drainage.

Long-term antibiotic therapy alone (over three weeks) is applicable in patients with single small abscesses. For larger abscesses (> 10 cm in diameter), percutaneous drainage is highly successful, with a 98% success rate. One patient required open drainage, and three patients underwent secondary percutaneous drainage procedures. Complications, mostly minor, occurred in 25% of patients, with one reported death. Open surgical drainage is considered when patients fail to respond to initial treatments.

### A subcutaneous nodule on the mid back [^111nXRC3]. JAAD Case Reports (2019). Low credibility.

- **Question 1**: What is the most likely clinical diagnosis?
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Epidermal cyst
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B. Cutaneous dermoid cyst
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C. Cutaneous Müllerian cyst
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D. Apocrine hidrocystoma
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; E. Hidradenoma papilliferum

- **Answers**:
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Epidermal cyst–Incorrect. An epidermal cyst is a flesh-colored to yellowish, fluctuant cystic nodule with an overlying punctum representing the follicle from which the cyst develops. They commonly present on the trunk, but these cysts contain keratin debris rather than clear fluid as seen in this patient.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B. Cutaneous dermoid cyst–Incorrect. A cutaneous dermoid cyst is a firm, cystic nodule that generally presents in the first 5 years of life and can persist into adulthood. Dermoid cysts are the result of incomplete closure of the embryonic zones. They commonly present on the nasal root or lateral end of the eyebrow. Dermoid cysts can present on the trunk as well. These lesions contain other cutaneous appendages such as hair, sebaceous lobules, and eccrine glands.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C. Cutaneous Müllerian cyst–Correct. Cutaneous Müllerian cysts are rare, benign, solitary lesions that typically occur on the lower extremities of young women. Rarely, these cysts may present in unusual locations such as the back. They are theorized to develop from heterotopic fimbrial type Müllerian epithelium that form a cyst under the influence of ovarian hormones after puberty. Similar cysts occurring in males have been reported, but these are recognized as a distinct subtype of cutaneous ciliated cysts theorized to be of eccrine origin.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D. Apocrine hidrocystoma–Incorrect. Apocrine hidrocystomas are usually solitary lesions.

### Prospective randomized study of marsupialization versus silver nitrate application in the management of Bartholin gland cysts and abscesses [^112Mf9kv]. Journal of Minimally Invasive Gynecology (2009). Low credibility.

The study objective was to prospectively compare the efficacy of marsupialization versus silver nitrate application in the treatment of Bartholin gland cysts and abscesses, both of which are widely used as outpatient procedures.

- **Design**: Prospective randomized trial, design classification I.

- **Setting**: Teaching and research hospital, a tertiary center.

- **Patients**: A total of 212 patients admitted to our gynecology clinic with symptomatic Bartholin gland cysts or abscesses.

- **Interventions**: Marsupialization and silver nitrate application in Bartholin gland cysts or abscesses.

- **Measurements and main results**: The 212 patients were randomly allocated to either marsupialization (Group I) or silver nitrate application (Group II) from March 2005 through March 2007. A total of 159 women were eligible for reevaluation at the end of the sixth month. Of these, 83 were randomized to Group I and 76 to Group II. The patients were called for revisits on day 3, day 7, month 1, and month 6 of treatment. The two groups were compared for recurrence rates as the primary outcome and duration of procedures, complications, size of scar tissue, and presence of dyspareunia as secondary outcomes. Comparisons of the two groups were evaluated by Pearson X(2) test and Mann-Whitney U test, as appropriate. The two groups were comparable with regard to age, parity, and diameter of cyst or abscess. The recurrence rates were similar: 24.1% in Group I and 26.3% in Group II at 6 months (p = .67). No statistically significant differences were found in respect to the duration of procedures or presence of dyspareunia. Complete healing without scar formation was observed in both groups.

### Recurrence of endometrial adenocarcinoma in a prior Bartholin's cyst marsupialization incision [^111zvcUA]. Gynecologic Oncology (2006). Low credibility.

Endometrial cancer recurrences in surgical incisions are rare and are thought to be due to seeding of the area with microscopic disease at the time of the original surgery.

- **Case**: A 53-year-old woman underwent a dual procedure of marsupialization of a benign Bartholin's cyst with hysteroscopic dilation and curettage for postmenopausal bleeding and received the diagnosis of endometrial adenocarcinoma. Final pathology from a subsequent hysterectomy and staging procedure demonstrated a surgical Stage IB Grade 1 endometrial cancer. An isolated recurrence of disease in her marsupialization scar was discovered 10 months after her staging procedure.

- **Conclusion**: This case represents the only described endometrial cancer recurrence in a Bartholin's gland, which was contaminated at the time of the original hysteroscopy and dilation and curettage.

### Shrinking of a Tarlov cyst [^1167yatb]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). Low credibility.

In May 2016, the patient underwent treatment of symptomatic Tarlov cysts using two 18-gauge needles. The tip of the first needle was placed deep into the cyst, with the other being placed more superficially. About 2 mL of cerebrospinal fluid was aspirated. Subsequently, 0.5 cc of Marcaine and 2 mL of fibrin glue were injected into the cyst via the deep needle.

### Clinical characteristics and surgical outcomes of transcutaneous versus transconjunctival excision of Wolfring gland ductal cysts [^112WUQFg]. BMC Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Less invasive surgical methods, including simple aspiration, needling, and marsupialization, have been used. Cysts readily refill after simple aspiration. Similarly, needling is considered an inappropriate procedure, with only one reported case being treated this way. Six of our patients experienced recurrences of cysts following aspiration or needling before being referred to our institution.

Marsupialization, which involves deroofing of the cyst wall, offers a less invasive treatment. The procedure does not necessitate meticulous dissection of the cyst wall, which is technically more challenging and time-consuming. However, this approach may lead to recurrence with additional scarring in the future.

- **Limitations**: The retrospective nature of the study, non-randomization, and small sample size are notable limitations. Additionally, there may have been some bias regarding the transcutaneous versus transconjunctival approach selection by the surgeon. Historically, the authors utilized the transconjunctival approach for removing WGDCs but have progressively switched to the transcutaneous method in recent years. This shift was prompted by observing a significant occurrence of intraoperative cyst rupture, postoperative ptosis, and chronic eye irritation associated with conjunctival grafting in the transconjunctival route. Due to insufficient data on patients treated with the transconjunctival approach in earlier times, they were excluded from the study. This explains the relatively smaller number of patients and longer duration of follow-up among those treated.

### Imaging of lacrimal gland pathologies: A radiological pattern-based approach [^115skeQe]. Current Problems in Diagnostic Radiology (2020). Low credibility.

Despite their unassuming size, lacrimal glands can be affected by a variety of pathologies, which often pose a diagnostic challenge clinically due to their nonspecific presentation as a palpable lump in the superolateral aspect of the orbit. There are myriad pathological entities, ranging from inflammatory to neoplastic lesions, that can affect the lacrimal glands. Cross-sectional imaging is essential for the detection, characterization, and mapping of these lesions. In this pictorial review, we propose a radiological pattern-based approach for various lacrimal gland lesions, providing a working algorithm for radiologists in the evaluation of lacrimal gland pathologies.

### Atypical location of a Bartholin cyst in adolescence [^116izQ4h]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2016). Low credibility.

Cystic lesions associated with the blockage of Bartholin gland ducts are frequently observed; however, occurrence outside the normal vestibular localization is quite rare.

- **Case**: A 16-year-old patient presented with a localized cystic lump approximately 4 cm in size on one of her labia minora. After an excision, she was diagnosed with an atypically localized Bartholin cyst.

- **Summary and conclusion**: It is challenging to make an early diagnosis of an atypically localized Bartholin cystic lesion in adolescence; it can only be confirmed through pathological examination. In the differential diagnosis of a vulvar lump, consideration should be given to the possibility of an atypically localized Bartholin cyst.

### Treatment of liver abscess: prospective randomized comparison of catheter drainage and needle aspiration [^115RPdM8]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

The aim of the study was to evaluate the clinical presentation and investigate the effectiveness of continuous catheter drainage in comparison to needle aspiration in the treatment of liver abscesses.

- **Methods**: This is a prospective randomized comparative study of 60 patients, presented in the outpatient and emergency department at the hospital. They were randomized equally into two groups: percutaneous needle aspiration and pigtail catheter drainage. The effectiveness of either treatment was measured in terms of duration of hospital stay, days to achieve clinical improvement, 50% reduction in abscess cavity size, and total/near total resolution of the abscess cavity. An independent t-test was used to analyze these parameters.

- **Results**: The success rate was significantly better in the catheter drainage group (P = 0.006). Patients in the pigtail catheter drainage group showed earlier clinical improvement (P = 0.039) and a 50% decrease in abscess cavity volume (P = 0.000) compared to those who underwent percutaneous needle aspiration.

- **Conclusion**: Percutaneous catheter drainage is a better modality compared to percutaneous needle aspiration, especially in larger abscesses that are partially liquefied or contain thick pus.

### Cancer of the vulva: 2025 update: FIGO cancer report 2025 [^111aBKqu]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Low credibility.

Bartholin gland carcinomas are rare forms of vulvar malignancy, accounting for approximately 5% of vulvar cancers. It is unclear what proportion is associated with high‐risk HPV infection. Cancers of the Bartholin glands may be either transitional cell or squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) that arise from the duct, or adenocarcinomas arising from the gland itself. There are also adenoid cystic and adenosquamous variants. All SCCs showed diffuse and intense p16 expression, consistent with the presence of HPV. The diagnosis is often made after resection of a persistent or recurrent Bartholin cyst.

Bartholin gland carcinomas are effectively treated with a radical hemivulvectomy and bilateral groin dissection; however, they are more likely to have metastatic disease at presentation. Due to their location deep in the ischiorectal fossa, adequate surgical margins may be difficult to achieve, and postoperative radiation may decrease the likelihood of local recurrence.

Radical local excision alone is adequate treatment for adenoid cystic lesions, and adjuvant radiation is recommended for positive margins or perineural invasion.

### Association of Bartholin cysts and abscesses and sexually transmitted infections [^113YJeUL]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Bartholin gland cysts or abscesses account for many gynecologic visits in the emergency department (ED). Previous smaller studies have suggested a link between Bartholin cysts/abscesses and sexually transmitted infections (STIs), but few studies have involved the ED.

- **Methods**: We retrospectively identified patients aged 18 years or older seen in one ED between January 2012 and March 2017 who had urinalysis and urine culture and/or were tested for gonorrhea, chlamydia, or trichomonas by nucleic acid amplification testing. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to evaluate associations between Bartholin cysts/abscesses and demographics, laboratory findings, and ED diagnoses.

- **Results**: Data were collected for 75,000 ED patients; 64 patients had a diagnosis of Bartholin cyst or abscess, 40 of whom were also tested for Neisseria gonorrhoeae or Chlamydia trachomatis. Ten percent of patients with a Bartholin cyst/abscess were infected with N. gonorrhoeae, compared with 3% of those without a Bartholin cyst/abscess (P = 0.008). The rates of C. trachomatis and Trichomonas vaginalis infections were 13% and 26%, respectively, among patients with a Bartholin cyst/abscess, compared with 8% and 30%, respectively, among those without a Bartholin cyst/abscess (P > .05 for both). On regression analysis, only increased urobilinogen level (β, 0.31; odds ratio, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.11–1.66; p = 0.003) and infection with N. gonorrhoeae (β, 1.69; odds ratio, 5.40; 95% CI, 1.43–20.35; p = 0.01) were associated with a Bartholin cyst/abscess.

### Urinary retention as the presentation of Bartholin's duct cyst in a neonate [^114DQE1J]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2012). Low credibility.

Patients with a vaginal mass (large Bartholin's duct cyst) associated with a contralateral renal cyst and hydroureteronephrosis are unable to urinate. While occasionally seen in adults, Bartholin's duct cysts are rare in neonates. The origins of Bartholin's and Gartner's cysts can be traced to the mesonephric duct. Given the rarity of these cysts, there is significant confusion regarding their diagnosis, management, and prognosis. Here, we present the first report of an interlabial mass as a Bartholin's duct cyst in a neonate. The treatment of vaginal cysts is also discussed.

### Bartholin's gland abscess caused by in a sexually active young woman [^114LzVra]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). Low credibility.

Gynaecological infections are frequent in women, particularly in young women during their reproductive years. Anatomophysiologically, Bartholin's gland is greatly susceptible to infections and is characterised by an inherent polymicrobial population. In fact, gynaecological microbiota has a set of agents coming from the perianal region that colonise the vagina and, in particular, Bartholin's gland. Taking this into account, infections caused by agents that do not belong to the genital microbiota are less frequent. Here, we describe a case of a 23-year-old woman with an abscess in Bartholin's gland caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae.

The MAGIC study, conducted by the White Rose Surgical Collaborative and MAGIC Collaborators, explored the management of subcutaneous abscesses. This prospective cross-sectional investigation involved a collaboration of medical professionals from various hospitals including Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust, Chesterfield Royal Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, and Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, among others.

Participants examined the effectiveness of current treatment protocols for subcutaneous abscesses, providing valuable insights into surgical practices. Despite the comprehensive data gathered, the study has been assigned a low credibility rating, necessitating further validation through additional randomized controlled trials and peer-reviewed guidelines.

### Cancer of the vulva: 2021 update [^115JbH5G]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2021). Low credibility.

Bartholin gland carcinomas are rare forms of vulvar malignancy, accounting for about 5% of vulvar cancers. It is unclear what proportion is associated with high-risk HPV infection. Cancers of the Bartholin glands may be either transitional cell or squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) that arise from the duct, or adenocarcinomas arising from the gland itself. There are also adenoid cystic and adenosquamous variants. All SCCs showed diffuse and intense p16 expression consistent with the presence of HPV. The diagnosis is often made after resection of a persistent Bartholin cyst.

Bartholin gland carcinomas are effectively treated with a radical hemivulvectomy and bilateral groin dissection; however, they are more likely to have metastatic disease at presentation. Due to their location deep in the ischiorectal fossa, achieving adequate surgical margins may be difficult, and postoperative radiation may decrease the likelihood of local recurrence.

Radical wide local excision alone is adequate treatment for adenoid cystic lesions, and adjuvant radiation is recommended for positive margins or perineural invasion.

### Perineal leiomyoma mimicking complex Bartholin mass [^112DPp5z]. International Urogynecology Journal (2010). Low credibility.

Leiomyomas of the external genitalia are uncommon soft tissue tumors. We report the case of a 47-year-old woman with perineal leiomyomas mimicking Bartholin's gland mass, as indicated by preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings. Leiomyomas in the vulvar region should be differentiated from complicated Bartholin's gland cysts, and preoperative MRI findings may be misleading. Complete surgical excision should be the treatment of choice.

### CO2 laser treatment for Bartholin gland abscess: Ultrasound evaluation of risk recurrence [^113pfkwX]. Journal of Minimally Invasive Gynecology (2013). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of CO2 laser treatment and the parameters correlated with recurrence in patients with Bartholin gland abscesses treated using this approach. This prospective study, classified as II-2 by the Canadian Task Force, was conducted at a university hospital. The study involved 147 patients who met the eligibility criteria.

The intervention included a preoperative ultrasound evaluation of Bartholin gland lesions followed by CO2 laser treatment. All patients received CO2 laser therapy with a median operative time of 15 minutes (range, 12–35 minutes). The median postoperative stay was 1 hour (range, 1–4 hours). The estimated 3-year relapse-free rate was 88.56%. It was found that lesion wall thickness of 0.5–1.5 mm, multilocular lesions, and hyperechogenic lesions were correlated with recurrence.

In conclusion, CO2 laser treatment of Bartholin gland abscesses could be a valid option. Ultrasound characteristics of Bartholin gland lesions may predict the recurrence rate of the lesions.

### Pituitary abscess [^117MkQqz]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Low credibility.

The pituitary gland is an endocrine gland about the size of a pea and weighs 0.5 grams in humans. Hormones secreted from the pituitary gland control growth, blood pressure, certain functions of the sex organs, thyroid glands, and metabolism, as well as some aspects of pregnancy, childbirth, nursing, water/salt concentration, and the kidneys, temperature regulation, and pain relief. Different kinds of lesions may develop in the pituitary gland which could lead to over or under-secretion of hormone production and subsequently present as an incidental finding on imaging, symptoms of mass pressure, or hormonal disturbances.

A rare pituitary lesion is a pituitary abscess. Pituitary abscess is very rare, accounting for 0.2%–0.6% of all pituitary lesions. Only around 250 case reports have been described so far since the first case was described by Heslop in 1848. Pituitary abscess is an uncommon disease that usually presents with vague symptoms. To reach a diagnosis in such cases is usually difficult. The condition is considered life-threatening; however, fortunately, the majority of cases have a rather chronic course. Based on different reports, these abscesses are characterized by the following: they constitute less than 1% of all the pituitary diseases seen by the specialist; there is a higher female predominance; the age range is between 12 to 76 years, and the average period between the onset of symptoms and diagnosis is 8 months.

Preoperative diagnosis is a dilemma as symptoms such as pituitary abnormal function are non-specific, and radiological findings are not distinctive.

### Solitary vulvar involvement of ovarian non-Hodgkin lymphoma mimicking Bartholin's abscess on 18F-FDG PET/CT [^114S6qDM]. Clinical Nuclear Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

A 49-year-old woman was diagnosed with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma of the left ovary. Two months after the hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy operation, the patient was referred to 18F-FDG PET/CT for staging. A mass lesion measuring 2.8 × 3 cm with intense 18F-FDG uptake was observed at the right labium majus, which could be considered as a Bartholin's cyst or abscess. The lesion was excised, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma involvement of the vulva was revealed by histopathology.

### Brain metastasis from an adenoid cystic carcinoma of the Bartholin gland. Case report [^115ENJKc]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2005). Low credibility.

Adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) of the Bartholin gland is an uncommon malignant gynecological tumor. Brain metastasis from a malignant gynecological lesion is encountered rarely, and the prognosis for this type of metastasis is poor. Different treatment protocols, such as resection, stereotactic radiosurgery, whole-brain radiation therapy (WBRT), and chemotherapy, are available and should be considered on an individual basis. In this article, the authors report a case of brain metastasis from an ACC of the Bartholin gland that was treated by resection and WBRT. A review of the literature did not reveal any other such case.

### Incidental Bartholin gland cysts identified on pelvic magnetic resonance imaging [^113QyUuy]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2012). Low credibility.

To estimate the prevalence of Bartholin gland cysts in asymptomatic women serving as control participants who underwent pelvic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as part of research studies, the secondary aim was to investigate potential demographic characteristics associated with Bartholin gland cysts.

- **Methods**: Pelvic MRIs from 430 control participants enrolled in five research projects were evaluated. All images were evaluated by at least two authors. The presence, laterality, and size of Bartholin gland cysts were recorded. Demographic information for each participant was obtained at the time of enrollment in the respective parent study.

- **Results**: Approximately 3% of the participants had visible Bartholin gland cysts on MRI scans. Fifty percent of the cysts were identified on the right side, 42.9% were seen on the left side, and 7.1% were bilateral. The cysts were, on average, 1.3×1.2×1.3 cm with dimensions ranging from 0.5 to 2.7 cm. There were no demographic differences between women with and without visible Bartholin gland cysts.

- **Conclusion**: Bartholin gland cysts occur in 3% of adult women. The cysts affect women across a broad range of ages and parity. Women with visible Bartholin gland cysts are demographically similar to women without cysts on pelvic imaging.

- **Level of evidence**: II.

### Bartholin duct cyst and gland abscess: Office management [^11365H2N]. American Family Physician (2019). Low credibility.

The Bartholin glands, located in the base of the labia minora, play a role in vaginal lubrication. Due to the presence of other glands, removal of a Bartholin gland does not affect lubrication. Ductal blockage of these typically pea-sized structures can lead to enlargement of the gland, resulting in the development of Bartholin duct cysts or gland abscesses. Two percent of women will develop a cyst or an abscess in their lifetime, so physicians should be familiar with the range of treatment options.

Bartholin duct cysts and gland abscesses can be treated in the office. Healing and recurrence rates are similar among fistulization, marsupialization, and silver nitrate and alcohol sclerotherapy. However, needle aspiration and incision and drainage, the two simplest procedures, are not recommended due to the relatively increased recurrence rate.

Regarding surgical interventions for pilonidal disease, and more specifically with respect to excision and repair, ASCRS 2019 guidelines recommend considering any of the following excision procedures (with individualized drain use) based on surgeon and patient preference in patients with chronic pilonidal cysts requiring surgery:

- **Excision and primary repair**: Consideration for off-midline closure should be given.
- **Excision with healing by secondary intention**: This approach might be suitable based on the case specifics.
- **Excision with marsupialization**: This is an alternative option for treatment.

### Management of Bartholin's duct cyst and gland abscess [^113YkcUS]. American Family Physician (2003). Low credibility.

Bartholin's duct cysts and gland abscesses are common issues among women of reproductive age. Bartholin's glands are located bilaterally at the posterior introitus, draining through ducts that open into the vestibule at approximately the 4 o'clock and 8 o'clock positions. These glands, normally pea-sized, can be palpated only if a duct becomes cystic or a gland abscess develops.

The differential diagnosis includes both cystic and solid lesions of the vulva, such as epidermal inclusion cyst, Skene's duct cyst, hidradenoma papilliferum, and lipoma.

- **Management goals**: The primary aim is to preserve the gland and its function, if possible.

- **Office-based procedures**: These include the insertion of a Word catheter for a duct cyst or gland abscess, and marsupialization of a cyst. Notably, marsupialization should not be used for treating a gland abscess.

- **Antibiotic therapy**: Broad-spectrum antibiotics are warranted only when cellulitis is present.

- **Excisional biopsy**: This is reserved for menopausal or perimenopausal women with an irregular, nodular Bartholin's gland mass to rule out adenocarcinoma.

### Bartholin's gland carcinoma: a 15-year experience [^111TUfoL]. Gynecologic Oncology (2001). Low credibility.

Our objective was to review our experience with carcinoma of Bartholin's gland relative to treatment and oncologic outcome.

Patient names were collected from our vulvar cancer database for the period September 1985 to September 2000. The medical records were retrospectively reviewed, and data were abstracted relative to demographics, presenting symptoms, treatment, and oncologic outcome.

We treated 12 women with Bartholin's gland carcinoma, and 11 patients are reported. Seven women presented with a painless vulvar mass, and 8 of 11 had initially been treated for an infectious process before referral to our institution. Squamous histology was most common, and the right gland was more frequently involved. Ten patients were treated with primary surgery, followed by adjuvant radiation in 7 for inadequate resection margins or lymphatic metastases. One patient was treated with primary chemoradiation. Stage I, II, III, IVA, and IVB disease was present in 3, 1, 4, 2, and 1 patient, respectively. Recurrence was suffered by 54.5% during a mean follow-up time of 73.5 months (median, 60; range, 8–180 months). Overall survival is 58.3% at the time of writing.

Conventional therapy for Bartholin's gland carcinoma yielded a 67% 5-year survival. Seventy-one percent of women receiving adjuvant radiotherapy recurred despite this precaution. Work is needed to identify an effective systemic therapy and to better determine which patients may benefit from pelvic radiotherapy.
