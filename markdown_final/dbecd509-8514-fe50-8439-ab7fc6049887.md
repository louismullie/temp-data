## Question

What to prescribe 89 year old for uti

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what to prescribe for an 89-year-old with a urinary tract infection. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and excluding asymptomatic bacteriuria. Then, I should assess severity and whether this is uncomplicated cystitis versus complicated UTI or pyelonephritis. Next, I will check renal function and other comorbidities that constrain drug choice. After that, I should select empiric therapy based on local resistance and guideline-preferred agents, determine duration, and plan for culture-directed de-escalation. Finally, I will consider special scenarios like catheter-associated infection, delirium without localizing symptoms, and stewardship checkpoints to avoid overtreatment.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis, because in older adults, asymptomatic bacteriuria is common and should not be treated. I need to ensure there are localizing urinary symptoms such as dysuria, frequency, urgency, new incontinence, suprapubic pain, or hematuria, and I should avoid anchoring on nonspecific findings like confusion or falls alone, which are not indications for antibiotics in the absence of urinary symptoms [^117VPowJ] [^115B8tWu] [^114drgDM].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should verify whether this is uncomplicated lower UTI versus complicated UTI or pyelonephritis by assessing for fever, chills, flank pain, rigors, or hemodynamic instability, and I should check for complicating factors such as male sex, indwelling catheter, recent urologic procedures, obstruction, diabetes, immunosuppression, or recent broad-spectrum antibiotics, because these shift empiric choices and duration toward broader coverage and longer therapy [^117Smpys] [^112bPvv4].

> Next, I should review renal function because many first-line agents require dose adjustment and some are contraindicated in significant renal impairment. I need to calculate creatinine clearance; if CrCl is less than 30 mL/min, nitrofurantoin is ineffective and should be avoided, whereas if CrCl is 30–60 mL/min, nitrofurantoin may still be used with caution and monitoring, and I should remember that age alone does not mandate dose changes, so I must individualize to actual kidney function [^111xvQ1V].

> For an 89-year-old with uncomplicated lower UTI and preserved renal function, I should preferentially choose nitrofurantoin 100 mg twice daily for 5–7 days, or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole if local resistance is under 20% and there is no sulfa allergy, typically for 5–7 days. If neither is suitable, fosfomycin 3 g as a single dose is reasonable, though I should confirm local E. coli susceptibility and consider that single-dose therapy may have higher recurrence in some settings, so I will tailor to prior response and patient preference [^112ZuMBn] [^117TcBoR].

> Wait, let me verify the duration question because older adults are often overtreated. Evidence suggests that short-course therapy of 3–6 days can be sufficient in elderly women with uncomplicated cystitis, with no clear advantage to 7–14 days, so I should individualize duration to symptom burden, comorbidities, and prior response, and I will plan to reassess at 48–72 hours to ensure clinical response before extending therapy [^117TcBoR] [^114giEYo].

> If the patient has complicated UTI or pyelonephritis, I should broaden empiric therapy and consider an oral fluoroquinolone such as levofloxacin for 7 days only if local resistance is under 10% and there has been no recent fluoroquinolone exposure, or alternatively use an oral beta-lactam like amoxicillin-clavulanate or a third-generation cephalosporin for 7–10 days, with the understanding that I will narrow to culture results as soon as possible and that 7 days is often adequate if the patient is clinically improving [^117Smpys] [^1127QRf6] [^111s2fcA].

> I should double-check catheter-associated UTI management. If the patient has an indwelling catheter, I need to remove or replace the catheter when feasible, obtain a urine culture from the newly placed device, and treat for 7 days if symptoms resolve promptly, extending to 10–14 days only if there is a delayed response or persistent symptoms, and I should avoid treating asymptomatic bacteriuria except before urologic procedures with mucosal trauma [^116RiYrc] [^116EXLaV] [^1137PKjR].

> But wait, what if the presentation is delirium or a fall with bacteriuria and no urinary symptoms? I need to ensure I do not treat the bacteriuria; instead, I should evaluate for other causes of delirium or falls and observe, because treating asymptomatic bacteriuria increases harm without benefit in this population, and I should document shared decision-making with caregivers to avoid reflex antibiotics [^117VPowJ] [^115B8tWu] [^114drgDM].

> I will now examine stewardship steps I must not miss. I should obtain a urine culture before starting antibiotics when feasible, reassess at 48–72 hours, and de-escalate or stop therapy if the clinical picture does not support UTI or if the culture is negative. I should also avoid fluoroquinolones when possible due to adverse effects and resistance, and I should consider that in very old adults, delays in appropriate therapy are associated with higher risks of bloodstream infection and mortality, so I must balance stewardship with timely treatment when UTI is truly present [^112bPvv4] [^112CZxo1] [^1127QRf6].

> Let me reconsider special risks in this 89-year-old. Advanced age, male sex, and comorbidities increase the risk of severe outcomes with undertreatment, so if the patient is systemically ill or has risk factors for resistance, I should have a lower threshold to broaden empiric therapy and ensure close follow-up, while still planning to narrow promptly once cultures return to minimize collateral damage [^112CZxo1] [^111KgKpK] [^112bPvv4].

> Putting this together, my default for an 89-year-old with confirmed uncomplicated lower UTI and CrCl above 30 mL/min is nitrofurantoin 100 mg twice daily for 5–7 days, with TMP-SMX if susceptible and no allergy, or single-dose fosfomycin if neither is suitable. If complicated UTI or pyelonephritis is suspected, I will use a fluoroquinolone for 7 days only if local resistance and patient risk profile permit, or an appropriate oral beta-lactam for 7–10 days, and I will obtain cultures, reassess at 48–72 hours, and de-escalate based on results, all while avoiding treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria and documenting the rationale for therapy [^112ZuMBn] [^117Smpys] [^117VPowJ].

---

For an 89-year-old with a confirmed UTI, use **nitrofurantoin 100 mg PO BID for 5–7 days** if CrCl ≥ 30 mL/min; if CrCl < 30 mL/min or intolerance, use **trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole 160/800 mg PO BID for 5–7 days** if local resistance is ≤ 20% and there is no sulfa allergy. Avoid **fluoroquinolones** unless no alternatives exist due to toxicity and resistance. Obtain a urine culture before starting antibiotics when possible, and adjust therapy based on sensitivities. Monitor for adverse effects and clinical response within 48–72 hours.

---

## Clinical assessment and diagnosis

- **Confirm diagnosis**: Ensure the patient has symptomatic UTI (dysuria, frequency, urgency, suprapubic pain, or new incontinence) and not asymptomatic bacteriuria, which should not be treated [^117VPowJ] [^115B8tWu].

- **Obtain urine culture**: Before initiating antibiotics, obtain a urine culture to guide targeted therapy, especially in older adults with higher risks of resistant organisms [^114JpJPa].

- **Assess comorbidities**: Evaluate for renal impairment, diabetes, immunosuppression, or structural abnormalities that may influence antibiotic choice and duration [^114JpJPa].

## Recommended antibiotic therapy

| **Antibiotic** | **Dosage and duration** | **Indications and considerations** |
|-|-|-|
| Nitrofurantoin | 100 mg PO BID for 5–7 days | - First-line if CrCl ≥ 30 mL/min <br/> - Avoid if CrCl < 30 mL/min [^111xvQ1V] |
| Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole | 160/800 mg PO BID for 5–7 days | - Use if local resistance ≤ 20% <br/> - Avoid if sulfa allergy |
| Fosfomycin | 3 g PO single dose | Alternative for uncomplicated cystitis; consider if first-line agents are unsuitable |
| Fluoroquinolones (e.g. ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin) | 250–500 mg PO BID for 5–7 days | - Reserve for complicated UTIs or when first-line agents are unsuitable due to toxicity and resistance [^112ZuMBn] |

---

## Special considerations in elderly patients

- **Renal function**: Adjust antibiotic dosing based on creatinine clearance; nitrofurantoin is ineffective if CrCl < 30 mL/min [^111xvQ1V].

- **Adverse effects**: Monitor for gastrointestinal upset, CNS effects, and hypersensitivity reactions, which are more common in elderly patients.

- **Drug interactions**: Review concomitant medications for potential interactions, especially with warfarin, digoxin, and antihypertensives.

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Monitor for **clinical response** within 48–72 hours; if there is no improvement, reassess the diagnosis, consider resistant organisms, or evaluate for complications such as obstruction or abscess [^112nVoR8]. Arrange **follow-up urine culture** if symptoms persist or recur to ensure eradication and guide further therapy [^1143JJsA].

---

## Preventive strategies

Encourage **hydration** to maintain adequate fluid intake and reduce recurrence risk. Address modifiable risk factors — such as constipation, incontinence, and poor hygiene — to help prevent future infections. Reserve **prophylactic antibiotics** for recurrent UTIs after discussing risks and benefits with the patient and caregivers [^1166XZJb].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **First-line therapy**: Nitrofurantoin 100 mg PO BID for 5–7 days if CrCl ≥ 30 mL/min.

- **Alternative therapy**: Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole 160/800 mg PO BID for 5–7 days if local resistance is ≤ 20% and no sulfa allergy.

- **Reserve fluoroquinolones**: For complicated UTIs or when first-line agents are unsuitable.

- **Obtain urine culture**: Before starting antibiotics when possible.

- **Monitor closely**: For clinical response and adverse effects within 48–72 hours.

---

For an 89-year-old with a confirmed UTI, **nitrofurantoin or TMP-SMX are preferred first-line options** for 5–7 days, with dosing adjusted for renal function and local resistance patterns. Fluoroquinolones are reserved for complicated cases or when first-line agents are unsuitable. Close monitoring and culture-guided therapy are essential to ensure effective treatment and minimize adverse effects.

### Urinary tract infection and asymptomatic bacteriuria in older adults [^113kGXtE]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are a significant cause of morbidity among older adults. However, antibiotic prescriptions for clinically suspected UTIs are often inappropriate. Health care providers frequently struggle to differentiate UTI from asymptomatic bacteriuria, particularly in patients presenting with nonspecific symptoms. Patients with baseline cognitive impairments that limit history-taking can be particularly challenging. This article reviews the epidemiology and pathogenesis of UTI in older adults. It discusses an approach to diagnosis and treatment focused on recognizing patients who would likely benefit from antibiotic treatment and on identifying patients for whom empiric antibiotic therapy should not be given.

The ratio of trimethoprim to nitrofurantoin prescribing gradually decreased over the study period from 6317/1981 in 2011 to 7870/3481 in 2015 for men (28.1% decrease); and from 36,372/12,853 to 43,383/24,099 (35.7% decrease), respectively, in women (Supplementary Fig. 2). Amongst women ≥ 70 years old, the proportion of UTIs treated with trimethoprim slightly decreased over time, from 45.9% in 2011 to 43.4% in 2015. The absolute number of UTIs diagnosed in this patient group increased during the study period, from 8938 in 2011 to 10,264 in 2015. In men, this number also increased over time (from 2657 to 3314, respectively), but the proportion of episodes treated with trimethoprim remained stable during the study period (overall 40.2%).

Second-line antimicrobial agents — when first-line medications are not available or cannot be prescribed — include β-lactams and fluoroquinolones, and "Randomized trial evidence suggests that the effectiveness of 3-day cefpodoxime or TMP-SMX is comparable at 89.4% vs 100%". However, "Generally, cephalosporins have a lower cure rate than TMP-SMX and fluoroquinolones", and "β-lactams, like cephalexin, can also be used if first-line antibiotics are inappropriate for any reason". Although "3-day fluoroquinolone regimens (eg, ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin) are highly efficacious, they are not first-line agents because of increasing resistance, higher expense, and serious adverse events as described in a 2016 Food and Drug Administration warning". Fosfomycin pharmacokinetics are noted as "resulting in urine levels that persist for 30 to 40 hours", and "When there is greater than 20% local E. coli resistance to TMP-SMX, an alternative treatment should be given".

### Decisions on antibiotic prescribing for suspected urinary tract infections in frail older adults: a qualitative study in four European countries [^112CRfsJ]. Age and Ageing (2022). Medium credibility.

Key Points

Antibiotics for suspected urinary tract infections (UTIs) are the result of multiple decisions by the physician, nursing staff, patient and/or caregiver.
Knowledge of differentiating between UTIs and asymptomatic bacteriuria needs to be strengthened.
Good communication is essential for appropriate prescribing but often impeded by high workload and lack of continuity of care.
Patients report to trust health care professionals in decision-making on UTIs; however, patients are not always involved.
We recommend antibiotic stewardship interventions to be multidisciplinary, multifaceted and tailored to the specific setting.

3.2 Antibiotic Treatment

Antibiotics were prescribed on the same date of diagnosis for 85.7% of UTIs (range from 20.7% in children of < 3 years to 89% in women aged 18–64 years). Only 17% of those who received antibiotics had a recorded urine testing within 10 days of diagnosis (range from 9.1% for the < 3 year group to 30.6% for 18- to 64-year-old women). Overall, the most common antibiotics initially prescribed were trimethoprim (56.8%) and nitrofurantoin (23.9%; Fig. 2). Cephalexin was the most commonly prescribed antibiotic in pregnant women (30.4%) and the second most commonly prescribed in children aged < 4 years (24.0% in those < 3 months and 5.6% in those aged 3 months to 3 years). Multiple antibiotics were administered to 3543 (0.8%) patients. Six percent of UTI episodes diagnosed in pregnant women (n = 62) were treated with trimethoprim and the proportion of UTIs treated with co-amoxiclav varied between 4.3% in children aged 4–15 years (n = 1086) and 7.6% in men aged 18–64 years (n = 1830). Chronic kidney disease (of stage ≥ 3) was diagnosed in 9.4% of episodes treated with nitrofurantoin in women and 15.0% of those in men (in 0.6 of episodes in women and 1.9% of those in men with stage ≥ 4).

### Evaluation of local prescribing patterns and antimicrobial resistance in women with acute pyelonephritis caused by… [^117Y45Tc]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Owing to increasing local Escherichia coli resistance and current guidelines for the treatment of acute pyelonephritis (APN) over 14 years old, an evaluation of local prescribing patterns is warranted.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to evaluate local prescribing patterns and appropriateness of antibiotics in acute uncomplicated APN.

Methods

This is a retrospective cohort study of female patients aged 18 to 89 years diagnosed with APN and positive urine culture growing E. coli. Exclusion criteria included pregnancy, immunocompromised status, and complicated urinary tract infections. Outcomes included antibiotic appropriateness and its effects on hospital admission, hospital length of stay, and 30-day readmission.

Results

Between 2017 and 2022, 308 female patients were diagnosed with APN and had positive urine cultures, with 104 seen only in the emergency department (ED) and 109 admitted to the hospital. Patients seen in the ED had a significant increase in E. coli resistance to discharge antibiotics (12.5% vs 2.8%, P = 0.0070). In those patients discharged on antibiotics resistant to E. coli, significantly more patients returned to the ED in 30 days (31.3% vs 10.7%, P = 0.0155).

Conclusion and Relevance

Patients seen only in the ED were more likely to have resistant organisms to discharge antibiotics compared with those admitted to the hospital. Patients discharged on antibiotics resistant to E. coli had a 3-fold increase in returning to the ED within 30 days regardless of admitted location. Follow-up of all cultures should be performed, and patients resistant to discharge antibiotics should be contacted and antibiotic regimens changed.

### Management of bacteriuria and urinary tract infections in the older adult [^112HusbM]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is one of the most frequent bacterial infections diagnosed in older adults and the most common reason for antibiotic prescriptions in nursing homes. Distinguishing between asymptomatic bacteriuria and UTI in older adults can be challenging and implementing a systematic approach to diagnosis using standard toolkits or algorithms is recommended for patients residing in post-acute and long-term care settings. This article reviews the pathophysiology, microbiology, diagnostic approach, treatment, and approaches to prophylaxis in the older adult.

### Effect of a multifaceted antibiotic stewardship intervention to improve antibiotic prescribing for suspected urinary tract infections in frail older adults (impresU): pragmatic cluster randomised controlled trial in four European countries [^113iLnSy]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

Primary and secondary outcomes

Of 1041 participants, 799 were not prescribed antibiotics for a suspected urinary tract infection, and 242 participants received on average 1.4 (range 1–5) antibiotic prescriptions during the entire study period. In the baseline period, the number of antibiotic prescriptions for suspected urinary tract infections was 87 per 174 person years (0.50 per person year) in the intervention group and 77 per 174 person years (0.44 per person year) in the usual care group (table 2). The primary outcome in the follow-up period was 54 per 202 person years (0.27 per person year) in the intervention group and 121 per 209 person years (0.58 per person year) in the usual care group. Supplementary material S3 displays the number of antibiotic prescriptions per month in the follow-up period. The unadjusted analysis showed that participants in the intervention clusters in the follow-up period had a lower rate of receiving an antibiotic prescription for a suspected urinary tract infection compared with participants in control clusters, with a rate ratio of 0.41 (95% confidence interval 0.25 to 0.65). When adjusted for potential confounders, the rate ratio was 0.42 (0.26 to 0.68). A similar rate ratio of 0.39 (0.24 to 0.63) resulted from the multiple imputation analysis (table 2).

### Reducing treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria: what works? [^112hWfHk]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

Asymptomatic bacteriuria is common, but usually benign. Inappropriate antimicrobial treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria contributes to negative antimicrobial outcomes. Optimizing antimicrobial use for bacteriuria is a component of antimicrobial stewardship programs and includes key practices of dissemination and implementation of guidelines, laboratory practices which support stewardship, and programs to monitor and implement optimal antimicrobial treatment for urinary infection. These activities vary in their effectiveness, costs, and complexity to institute. Stewardship strategies targeting unique populations with a high prevalence of bacteriuria and for whom symptom assessment is not straightforward need to be further developed and evaluated to support optimal stewardship.

### Antibiotic management of urinary tract infection in elderly patients in primary care and its association with bloodstream infections and all cause mortality: population based cohort study [^112CZxo1]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

Abstract

Objective

To evaluate the association between antibiotic treatment for urinary tract infection (UTI) and severe adverse outcomes in elderly patients in primary care.

Design

Retrospective population based cohort study.

Setting

Clinical Practice Research Datalink (2007–15) primary care records linked to hospital episode statistics and death records in England.

Participants

157 264 adults aged 65 years or older presenting to a general practitioner with at least one diagnosis of suspected or confirmed lower UTI from November 2007 to May 2015.

Main outcome measures

Bloodstream infection, hospital admission, and all cause mortality within 60 days after the index UTI diagnosis.

Results

Among 312 896 UTI episodes (157 264 unique patients), 7.2% (n = 22 534) did not have a record of antibiotics being prescribed and 6.2% (n = 19 292) showed a delay in antibiotic prescribing. 1539 episodes of bloodstream infection (0.5%) were recorded within 60 days after the initial UTI. The rate of bloodstream infection was significantly higher among those patients not prescribed an antibiotic (2.9%; n = 647) and those recorded as revisiting the general practitioner within seven days of the initial consultation for an antibiotic prescription compared with those given a prescription for an antibiotic at the initial consultation (2.2% v 0.2%; P = 0.001). After adjustment for covariates, patients were significantly more likely to experience a bloodstream infection in the deferred antibiotics group (adjusted odds ratio 7.12, 95% confidence interval 6.22 to 8.14) and no antibiotics group (8.08, 7.12 to 9.16) compared with the immediate antibiotics group. The number needed to harm (NNH) for occurrence of bloodstream infection was lower (greater risk) for the no antibiotics group (NNH = 37) than for the deferred antibiotics group (NNH = 51) compared with the immediate antibiotics group. The rate of hospital admissions was about double among cases with no antibiotics (27.0%) and deferred antibiotics (26.8%) compared with those prescribed immediate antibiotics (14.8%; P = 0.001). The risk of all cause mortality was significantly higher with deferred antibiotics and no antibiotics than with immediate antibiotics at any time during the 60 days follow-up (adjusted hazard ratio 1.16, 95% confidence interval 1.06 to 1.27 and 2.18, 2.04 to 2.33, respectively). Men older than 85 years were particularly at risk for both bloodstream infection and 60 day all cause mortality.

Conclusions

In elderly patients with a diagnosis of UTI in primary care, no antibiotics and deferred antibiotics were associated with a significant increase in bloodstream infection and all cause mortality compared with immediate antibiotics. In the context of an increase of Escherichia coli bloodstream infections in England, early initiation of recommended first line antibiotics for UTI in the older population is advocated.

Urinary tract infection (UTI) — epidemiology and recurrence risk include that more than 8 million ambulatory visits (84% women) in the United States in 2007 were due to UTI with 21% emergency department visits; in Canadian data with urine culture confirmation, the annual UTI incidence in women aged 20 to 79 years was 3% to 5% and in those aged 80 to 89 years was 12%, and two percent of these women had at least 6 UTIs in 2 years; after a single UTI, 30% to 44% of women will have a recurrent UTI, and 50% will have a third episode if they have had 2 UTIs in 6 months.

Patient considerations for selection of antimicrobial agent — renal function and nitrofurantoin use: Normal aging is associated with decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate and creatinine clearance, which impacts renally cleared drugs, and patients with decreased glomerular filtration rate are more likely to experience treatment failure. Nitrofurantoin is ineffective in patients with a CrCl of less than 30 mL/min, though updated guidelines support its use when CrCl is < 60 mL/min but > 30 mL/min; the American Geriatrics Society 2015 Beers Criteria Update Expert Panel decreased the CrCl threshold for nitrofurantoin from 60 to 30 mL/min based on 2 retrospective studies. Although more than 25% of individuals at least 65 years old have an estimated glomerular filtration rate of less than 60 mL/min, changes in microbial agent or dose based on age alone are not recommended, and prescribers should be familiar with antibiotic clearance and renal dosing recommendations.

### Antibiotic prescribing patterns and guideline concordance for uncomplicated urinary tract infections among adult women in the US military health system [^115PjHJn]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Discussion

The overall IDSA guideline-concordance rate for uncomplicated UTIs among adult women between 18 to 50 years of age within the MHS is high at 91.0%, with higher rates observed in direct care compared with private sector care. Despite this high IDSA guideline-concordance rate, there is variability among specialties with lower IDSA guideline-concordance rates observed in urology and obstetrics and gynecology compared with other specialties. Of the 9% discordance rate, the antibiotic overtreatment rate was 5.9%, with higher rates of overtreatment in emergency medicine and family medicine.

The MHS IDSA guideline-concordance rate of 91% encompasses both direct care and private sector care and is substantially higher than what has been previously reported in the literature. Even the MHS IDSA guideline-concordance rate among private sector care was substantially higher than previous studies at 89.0%. A prior study reported IDSA guideline-concordance rates of up to 64%, but this study included women up to 75 years of age and was a retrospective observational secondary analysis of the National Disease and Therapeutic Index, which used a sample of 4800 office-based physicians to calculate national projections. Our study used health care data directly from the MDR, and we used strict exclusion criteria to best match the patient population described in the IDSA guidelines, which may have been a factor in the higher IDSA guideline-concordance rates. In addition, the IDSA clinical practice guidelines were published in 2011, a time frame that has given clinicians at least 7 years to learn and implement the IDSA guidelines. It is less clear why the IDSA guideline-concordance rate was substantially higher in direct care. One factor could be that the military health system uses 1 universal medical record system, whereas the electronic medical record may be more fragmented among various facilities in the private sector. Despite a universally insured patient population, the concordance rates were higher in direct care, suggesting that there may be underlying differences with prescribing choices between these 2 care settings. It raises the question as to whether universal health care may be associated with greater adherence to clinical practice guidelines.

### Continuous low-dose antibiotic prophylaxis for adults with repeated urinary tract infections (AnTIC): a randomised, open-label trial [^111vjJEy]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2018). Medium credibility.

Results

Between Nov 25, 2013, and Jan 29, 2016, we screened 1743 patients for inclusion in the trial. Between Nov 26, 2013, and Jan 29, 2016, 404 participants were randomly allocated to groups: 203 (50%) participants were allocated to the prophylaxis group and 201 (50%) to the no prophylaxis (control) group (figure 1). 1339 participants were excluded before randomisation. We included 361 (89%) participants in the primary analysis, comprising 181 (89%) participants from the prophylaxis group and 180 (90%) participants from the control group. 22 participants in the prophylaxis group and 21 participants in the control group were not included in the primary analysis because they were missing follow-up data before 6 months. 34 (17%) participants in the prophylaxis group stopped taking antibiotic prophylaxis during the 12-month observation period and 26 (13%) participants allocated to receive no prophylaxis started antibiotic prophylaxis during the 12-month observation period. Of the 34 who stopped prophylaxis, 23 (68%) were in the first 6 months. Of the 26 who started prophylaxis in the no prophylaxis group, 17 (65%) were in the first 6 months. Participants who were given the treatment of the other group were included in the primary analysis, if otherwise eligible, and they were evaluated by their original allocation. The most common reasons for patient withdrawal during the first 12 months were unwillingness to continue with the study, unwillingness to continue as a result of comorbidities, and study burden being too great. Participant characteristics were similar between the groups at baseline (table 1). At 12 months, 77 (78%) of 99 participants allocated to prophylaxis who expressed a preference stated that they wished to continue to receive prophylaxis; in the control group, 83 (80%) of 104 participants stated that they wished to continue without prophylaxis.

Asymptomatic bacteriuria in older adults — "Don't use antimicrobials to treat bacteriuria in older adults unless specific urinary tract symptoms are present". ASB prevalence increases with age: in community women age 65 to 90 it ranges from 6% to 16%, is highest in women age 90 and older at 22% to 43%, and in community men age 65 and older it ranges from 5% to 21%, with the highest prevalence in those age 90 and older; in institutionalized elderly, 25% to 50% of women and 15% to 35% of men have ASB. Antimicrobial therapy for ASB has no short- or long-term benefits for mortality, genitourinary symptoms, or subsequent symptomatic episodes and in acute-care settings causes adverse drug reactions and re-infection with more-resistant organisms; although in long-term-care facilities individuals with bacteriuria are at greater risk of symptomatic infection, this is not attributable to bacteriuria. Identifying symptomatic urinary tract infection (UTI) in frail or cognitively impaired elderly is often challenging, and the Society of Healthcare Epidemiology of America has published proposed criteria for initiation of antibiotics and surveillance definitions for nursing homes. For older adults with ASB undergoing traumatic genitourinary procedures with mucosal bleeding, antimicrobial treatment is supported in men undergoing transurethral resection of the prostate, and screening for and treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria is recommended before urologic procedures for which mucosal bleeding is anticipated.

Recurrent urinary tract infection (rUTI) treatment principles — treatment options "can be stratified by whether complicating features, such as known abnormal genitourinary anatomy, immunosuppression, and chronic catheterization, are present", and "Antibiotic therapy is typically used to treat active infections and prevent future infections; the treatment regimen, route, and duration will vary based on the clinical situation and should be individualized for each patient"; strategies "can be divided into treatment of an acute episode (provider prescribed or self-treatment) or prophylaxis (to prevent further episodes)"; "Whenever possible, rUTI patients should have a culture sent before treatment", although "Empiric therapy can be initiated before urine culture results if clinically indicated (such as history of UTI-related sepsis or pyelonephritis)", and "Antibiotic choice should be tailored to the individual patient and pathogens, community and patient resistance patterns, costs, drug availability, patient allergies, and patient tolerance/ability to comply"; clinicians "should be familiar with the antibiotic-resistant patterns in their communities which is generally available via antibiograms through any clinical laboratory", and "Empiric regimens should be altered if necessary based on the urine culture results".

Results

Patient characteristics

A thousand files were reviewed before inclusion (Fig. 1). Among them, 824 patients did not have antibiotics prescription. Among the 176 remaining patients, 48 were excluded: 4 because no guidelines could be used to assess the primary outcomes, 44 because no clinical or paraclinical information were available. Finally, 128 patients were included. The characteristics of the population are shown in Table 1 and Additional file 1: Table S2: 93 (73%) patients were women, median age were 87 years old, the mean Charlson's comorbidity was 2.48.

Antibiotics prescriptions characteristics

Antibiotics were prescribed for the following infectious disease: 32 (25%) for pneumonia, 37 (29%) for cystitis, 11 (9%) for upper urinary tract infection (women) and 11 (9%) for male urinary tract infection (Additional file 1: Table S2). Among the 128 patients, guidelines were respected in 59 (46%) patients, 32 (25%) patients received antibiotics for uncertain diagnosis and 96 (75%) received antibiotics for certain or probable bacterial infection. Among these 96 patients, 87 (90%) patients had an adapted molecule (Additional file 1: Table S1), 62 (71%) patients had an adapted molecule and an appropriate duration and 59 (61%) patients had molecule, duration and dose adapted.

Factors influencing antibiotic prescription according to the guidelines

In Multivariable analysis (Table 2), the following factors were significantly associated with antibiotic prescription in accordance with guidelines: prescription of 2 antibiotics or more (OR = 0.168, 95% IC = 0.037–0.758, p < 0.05); 85 years of age and more (OR = 0.375, 95% IC = 0.151–0.931, p < 0.05); Charlson comorbidity index score (OR = 0.750, 95% IC = 0.572–0.984, p < 0.05).

### Personal clinical history predicts antibiotic resistance of urinary tract infections [^114HeJV5]. Nature Medicine (2019). Excellent credibility.

Antibiotic resistance is prevalent among the bacterial pathogens causing urinary tract infections. However, antimicrobial treatment is often prescribed 'empirically', in the absence of antibiotic susceptibility testing, risking mismatched and therefore ineffective treatment. Here, linking a 10-year longitudinal data set of over 700,000 community-acquired urinary tract infections with over 5,000,000 individually resolved records of antibiotic purchases, we identify strong associations of antibiotic resistance with the demographics, records of past urine cultures and history of drug purchases of the patients. When combined together, these associations allow for machine-learning-based personalized drug-specific predictions of antibiotic resistance, thereby enabling drug-prescribing algorithms that match an antibiotic treatment recommendation to the expected resistance of each sample. Applying these algorithms retrospectively, over a 1-year test period, we find that they greatly reduce the risk of mismatched treatment compared with the current standard of care. The clinical application of such algorithms may help improve the effectiveness of antimicrobial treatments.

### Antibiotic overprescription for "Urinary tract infections" is associated with poor diagnostic stewardship and low adherence to guidelines [^111ag7A6]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

With nearly half of women experiencing a urinary tract infection (UTI) in their lifetime, these infections are one of the leading reasons for antibiotic prescriptions in the United States and worldwide. Despite their clinical ubiquity, physicians exhibit significant variation in their approaches to the workup and treatment of uncomplicated UTIs that may not always follow clinical practice guidelines. Use of unvalidated approaches to the management of UTIs may lead to inaccurate diagnoses and inappropriate antibiotic treatments; prior studies demonstrate that 50%–70% of antibiotic prescriptions for UTI may be inappropriate, which contributes to worsening global rates of antibiotic resistance.

Current treatment guidelines from the American Urological Society (AUA), Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA), and American Geriatrics Society (AGS) agree that UTI diagnosis should be based on clinical symptomology of urinary symptoms (e.g. dysuria, hematuria, urinary frequency, new incontinence in the absence of vaginal symptoms) associated with culture‐proven bacteriuria with a bacterial uropathogen. Rates of asymptomatic bacteriuria range from 1% to 5% in premenopausal women to 16% in older women in the community and as high as 50% for older women in long‐term care facilities, demonstrating why appropriate clinical symptoms are needed to diagnose a UTI.

Prior studies, however, have shown that among patients diagnosed with a UTI in the emergency room (ER), only 32% of adults and 17% of the oldest adults have urinary symptoms, demonstrating poor adherence to current clinical practice guidelines. Patients who have been inappropriately treated with antibiotics for a UTI (e.g. treating those with asymptomatic bacteriuria) have worse outcomes, which may include subsequent infections with multidrug‐resistant organisms or substantial medication side effects. Patients who have an inappropriate initial antibiotic prescription are also subjected to additional drug costs and are at risk of antibiotic switching which can cost up to $2000 more per patient.

Overdiagnosis and overtreatment of UTIs produce worse patient outcomes, increased healthcare costs, and higher societal antibiotic burden. The goals of our study were to evaluate the factors associated with inappropriate diagnosis and treatment of cystitis in the outpatient setting in a set of patients diagnosed with UTI without signs of bacteremia.

### Three days of ciprofloxacin for UTI in older women… [^1147bjwh]. AAFP (2004). Low credibility.

Clinical Question: Is three days of ciprofloxacin therapy as effective as seven to 10 days of the same drug in older women with urinary tract infection. Setting: Outpatient Study Design: Randomized controlled trial. Synopsis: In this study, women older than 65 years with a positive urine culture and at least one symptom of UTI were randomized to receive oral ciprofloxacin in a dosage of 250 mg twice daily for three days plus placebo for four days or ciprofloxacin in a dosage of 250 mg twice daily for seven days. Women with diabetes, an indwelling catheter, abnormal renal function, sepsis, recent use of antibiotics, or signs of pyelonephritis were excluded. The groups were similar at base-line, allocation was appropriately concealed, and analysis was by intention to treat. Patients were followed for a total of six weeks.

Four patients withdrew from the seven-day group because of adverse events, compared with one patient in the three-day group. Two deaths occurred in each group. Most patients had Escherichia coli, and 15. 8 percent had Klebsiella pneumoniae. No differences between groups were noted two days after completion of antibiotic therapy regarding bacterial eradication or symptom improvement. The same was true at six weeks, with similar rates of reinfection and relapse. Adverse effects — drowsiness, loss of appetite, and nausea or vomiting, in particular — were more common among patients in the seven-day group.

Bottom Line: This reasonably large study found that treatment with three days of ciprofloxacin twice daily is as effective and better tolerated than seven days of treatment in healthy older women with UTI. Although a much larger study might find a small difference in outcomes, it is unlikely to be clinically meaningful; this study was powered to detect a modest 10 percent difference in outcomes.

### Unnecessary antibiotics in older female patients with recurrent urinary tract infections [^114UGBTP]. International Urogynecology Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

✱ p < .05

The overall rate of unnecessary antibiotics was 41% and did not differ across specialties. The most common clinical scenario in which unnecessary antibiotics were prescribed was no documentation of UTI-specific symptom (60%). Asymptomatic bacteriuria accounted for 46% of the unnecessary prescriptions. Other scenarios for unnecessary prescription included antibiotics prescribed even when pyuria was absent (32%) or urine culture was negative (18%). In 11% of episodes, an antibiotic was prescribed without documentation of any UTI-specific symptom and without any urine test.

Demographic variables, SVI, and ever seeing a urology/urogynecology specialist were not associated with a patient ever having received an unnecessary antibiotic (Table 2). Patients whose primary language was English were significantly more likely to have received an unnecessary antibiotic (p = 0.04).

Table 2
Factors associated with recurrent UTI patients who ever received an unnecessary antibiotic

There were fewer documented UTI-specific symptoms in episodes of unnecessary antibiotic prescription, with no symptoms documented in 60% of episodes, compared to situations where an antibiotic was prescribed appropriately, with no symptoms documented in only 1% of episodes (Table 3). The number of documented UTI-specific symptoms was also higher when an antibiotic was prescribed appropriately.

### Management of urinary tract infections in elderly patients: strategies for improvement [^117NdFZ4]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is one of the most common infections affecting the elderly. However, UTI is overdiagnosed and overtreated in this group. This project aimed to look into strategies for improving the management of UTI in elderly medical inpatients. A retrospective audit was performed on the case notes of medical inpatients in a district general hospital from December 2012 to April 2013. The target measures for improvement include increasing adherence to SIGN guidelines in the diagnosis of UTI, increasing the frequency and timeliness of urinary culture collection in suspected UTI, and increasing use of urine culture sensitivities to tailor antimicrobial treatments. Initial baseline measurement revealed 16 patients treated for UTI. 31.3% of these fulfilled SIGN criteria for UTI. 68.5% had urine cultures performed. 60% of patients with positive urine cultures had correct antibiotic therapy after sensitivity results. The mean time from the diagnosis of UTI to urine collection for culture was 4 days. Three further cycles were performed. Following each cycle, improvement measures were implemented to raise the awareness of medical staff about the management of UTI in the elderly. These comprised presentations to junior doctors at local teaching sessions; emails to ward managers with results of the previous audit cycle broken down by ward; and prominent display of guidelines on medical wards and ensuring availability of 'Newcastle pads' for taking sterile urine cultures from incontinent patients. In the final cycle, 19 patients were diagnosed with UTI. 42.1% of these fulfilled SIGN criteria for diagnosis of UTI. 89.5% had urine cultures sent. 86.7% of patients with a positive urine culture were treated with appropriate antibiotics after sensitivities became available. Mean time from UTI diagnosis to culture collection improved to zero days. In conclusion, continuous educational measures, performance feedback, and increased availability of specialist equipment are imperative for improving management of UTIs in the elderly.

### "Urinary tract infection"-requiem for a heavyweight [^111XDEJp]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2017). Low credibility.

"Urinary tract infection" ("UTI") is an ambiguous, expansive, overused diagnosis that can lead to marked, harmful antibiotic overtreatment. "Significant bacteriuria", central to most definitions of "UTI", has little significance in identifying individuals who will benefit from treatment. "Urinary symptoms" are similarly uninformative. Neither criterion is well defined. Bacteriuria and symptoms remit and recur spontaneously. Treatment is standard for acute uncomplicated cystitis and common for asymptomatic bacteriuria, but definite benefits are few. Treatment for "UTI" in older adults with delirium and bacteriuria is widespread but no evidence supports the practice, and expert opinion opposes it. Sensitive diagnostic tests now demonstrate that healthy urinary tracts host a ubiquitous, complex microbial community. Recognition of this microbiome, largely undetectable using standard agar-based cultures, offers a new perspective on "UTI". Everyone is bacteriuric. From this perspective, most people who are treated for a "UTI" would probably be better off without treatment. Elderly adults, little studied in this regard, face particular risk. Invasive bacterial diseases such as pyelonephritis and bacteremic bacteriuria are also "UTIs". Mindful decisions about antibiotic use will require a far better understanding of how pathogenicity arises within microbial communities. It is likely that public education and meaningful informed-consent discussions about antibiotic treatment of bacteriuria, emphasizing potential harms and uncertain benefits, would reduce overtreatment. Emphasizing the microbiome's significance and using the term "urinary tract dysbiosis" instead of "UTI" might also help and might encourage mindful study of the relationships among host, aging, microbiome, disease, and antibiotic treatment.

IDSA 2019 asymptomatic bacteriuria — older, functionally or cognitively impaired patients: In older patients with functional and/or cognitive impairment with bacteriuria and delirium (acute mental status change, confusion) and without local genitourinary symptoms or other systemic signs of infection, we recommend assessment for other causes and careful observation rather than antimicrobial treatment (strong recommendation, low-quality evidence). In older patients with functional and/or cognitive impairment with bacteriuria and without local genitourinary symptoms or other systemic signs of infection who experience a fall, we recommend assessment for other causes and careful observation rather than antimicrobial treatment of bacteriuria (strong recommendation, very low-quality evidence). Values and preferences emphasize avoiding adverse outcomes of antimicrobial therapy such as CDI, increased antimicrobial resistance, or adverse drug effects when benefit is unproven. Remarks note that for a bacteriuric patient with fever and other systemic signs potentially consistent with a severe infection (sepsis) and without a localizing source, broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy directed against urinary and nonurinary sources should be initiated.

Self-treatment with antibiotics for recurrent UTI — Self-treatment can be paired with standing physician orders for urine culture before and possibly after treatment, but compared with continuous prophylaxis it is associated with a higher rate of infection (2.2 UTI per year vs 0.2 UTI per year). Self-treatment is an option for women with the ability to reliably recognize UTI symptoms and start antibiotics, those not suitable for long-term prophylaxis, or those who do not wish to take long-term therapy, and patients should contact their clinician if symptoms progress or fail to resolve within 48 hours. Fluoroquinolones are not preferred agents for self-treatment regimens, and we recommend use of other agents whenever possible.

### Antibiotic duration for treating uncomplicated, symptomatic lower urinary tract infections in elderly women [^114giEYo]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Urinary tract infections are common in elderly patients. Authors of non systematic literature reviews often recommend longer treatment durations (7–14 days) for older patients than for younger women, but the scientific evidence for such recommendations is not clear.

Objectives

To determine the optimal duration of antibiotic treatment for uncomplicated symptomatic lower urinary tract infections in elderly women.

Search Strategy

We contacted known investigators and pharmaceutical companies marketing antibiotics used to treat urinary tract infections, screened the reference list of identified articles, reviews and books, and searched the following data bases: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Healthstar, Popline, Gerolit, Bioethics Line, The Cochrane Library, Dissertation Abstracts International, Index to Scientific & Technical Proceedings.

Selection Criteria

All randomized controlled trials in which different treatment durations of oral antibiotics for uncomplicated symptomatic lower urinary tract infections in elderly women were compared. We excluded patients with fever or flank pain and those with complicating factors. Trials with treatment durations longer than 14 days or designed for prevention of urinary tract infection were also excluded. No language restriction was applied.

Data Collection and Analysis

The quality of all selected trials was assessed and data extracted by the reviewers. Main outcome measures were persistence of urinary symptoms (short-term and long-term efficacy), effect on mental and functional status and adverse drug reactions. To compare the different treatment durations, we defined the following categories of duration: single dose, short course (3–6 days) and long course (7–14 days). Relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated for each trial and outcome and were then combined using a random effects model.

Main Results

Thirteen trials were included in this review. Six trials compared single dose with short-term treatment (3–6 days), three studies single dose with long-term treatment (7–14 days) and four trials short-term with long term treatment. Eight trials also included younger patients, but provided a subgroup analysis for elderly women. The methodological quality of all trials was low. All trials reported results of bacteriological cure rate; less often clinical outcomes (e.g. improvement or cure of symptoms) were analyzed. Only five trials compared the same antibiotic given for a different length of time. We performed a separate analysis for these trials. The rate of persistent bacteriuria rate at short-term (two weeks post-treatment) was better in the longer treatment group (3–14 days) than in the single dose group (RR 1.84, 95% CI 1.18 to 2.86). However, the rate of persistent bacteria at long term and the clinical cure rate showed no statistically significant difference between the two groups. Patients showed a preference for single dose treatment (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.88), however this was based on only one trial comparing the same antibiotic. The comparison of short (3–6 days) and longer treatments (7–14 days) did not show any significant difference, but the number of included studies and sample size were low.

Reviewer's Conclusions

This review suggests that single dose antibiotic treatment is less effective but may be better accepted by the patients than longer treatment durations (3–14 days). In addition there was no significant difference between short course (3–6 days) versus longer course (7–14 days) antibiotics. The methodological quality of the identified trials was poor and the optimal treatment duration could not be determined. We therefore need more appropriately designed randomized controlled trials testing the effect, - on clinical relevant outcomes -, of different treatment durations of a given antibiotic in a strictly defined population of elderly women.

Acute urinary tract infection (UTI) with complicating factors — empiric management and pyelonephritis exclusions: When empiric therapy of an acute UTI with complicating factors is initiated, treatment should be reevaluated once urine culture and sensitivity results are available; the initial selection of empiric therapy should reflect the patient's individual uropathogen history, current treatment (eg, if currently on UTI suppression antibiotics), and response to prior therapy, and if clinically reasonable, antimicrobial therapy should be delayed pending culture results and organism susceptibility so antimicrobial treatment can be targeted based on the uropathogen profile. For pyelonephritis, several otherwise useful UTI antibiotics are not recommended for acute pyelonephritis treatment, including nitrofurantoin and fosfomycin; TMP-SMX is not recommended for empiric treatment because of high rates of TMP-SMX resistance, and empirically initiated antibiotics should be refined when the urine culture results are available.

### Lower urinary tract infections: management, outcomes and risk factors for antibiotic Re-prescription in primary care [^113fJVju]. EClinicalMedicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Summary

Background

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are major drivers of antibiotic prescribing in primary care. Inappropriate antibiotic prescribing for UTIs likely drives antibiotic resistance. We aimed to describe current investigation and antibiotic treatment to examine opportunities for improved antimicrobial stewardship.

Methods

We identified a cohort of all patients with lower UTI diagnosis between 2011 and 2015 in the 390 primary care practices contributing data to ResearchOne in England. We examined investigation, antibiotic treatment and antibiotic re-prescription within 28 days according to guideline-defined patient groups. We assessed risk factors for re-prescription using mixed-effect logistic regression.

Findings

In total, 494,675 UTIs were diagnosed in 300,354 patients. Median age was 54 years, and 83.3% were women. Same-day antibiotic was prescribed for 85.7% of UTIs; 56.8% were treated with trimethoprim, and urine sampling was undertaken in 25.0%. The antibiotic re-prescription rate was low (17,430, 4.1%) and increased slightly over time in men (from 5.2% in 2011 to 6.2% in 2015). Overall, 21.1% of pre-prescription were for the same antibiotic. The percentage of adults with recurrent UTIs ranged from 1.0% in 18–64 year-old men to 2.6% in women ≥ 65 years. The risk of antibiotic re-prescription increased with age, calendar year, recent antibiotic prescribing and treatment with antibiotic other than trimethoprim or nitrofurantoin.

Interpretation

Most patients diagnosed with lower UTI in primary care receive same-day empirical antibiotics with little diversity in choice of agent. The antibiotic re-prescription rate is low. Microbiological investigation and re-prescription of the same antibiotic given for the initial episode happened in one quarter of UTIs.

### Antibiotic duration for treating uncomplicated, symptomatic lower urinary tract infections in elderly women [^117TcBoR]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Urinary tract infections (UTI) are common in elderly patients. Authors of non systematic literature reviews often recommend longer treatment durations (7 to 14 days) for older women, but the evidence for such recommendations is unclear.

Objectives

To determine the optimal duration of antibiotic treatment for uncomplicated symptomatic lower UTI in elderly women.

Search Strategy

We contacted known investigators and pharmaceutical companies, screened reference lists of identified articles, reviews and books, and searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Healthstar, Popline, Gerolit, Bioethics Line, The Cochrane Library, Dissertation Abstracts International and Index to Scientific & Technical Proceedings without language restriction. Date of most recent search: 7 May 2008.

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing different treatment durations of oral antibiotics for uncomplicated symptomatic lower UTIs in elderly women were included. Whenever possible we obtained outcome data for older women included in studies with a broader age range. We excluded patients with fever, flank pain or complicating factors; studies with treatment durations longer than 14 days and prevention studies.

Data Collection and Analysis

The two authors independently assessed study quality and extracted data. Statistical analyses were performed using the random effects model and results expressed as risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous outcomes and mean difference (MD) for continuous outcomes with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Main Results

Fifteen studies (1644 elderly women) were included. Three studies compared single dose with short-course treatment (3 to 6 days), six compared single dose with long-course treatment (7 to 14 days) and six compared short- with long-course treatment. Methodological quality of all studies was low except for a more recent geriatric study. There was a significant difference for persistent UTI between single dose and short-course treatment (RR 2.01, 95% CI 1.05 to 3.84) and single versus long-course treatment (RR 1.93, 1.01 to 3.70 95% CI), in the short-term (< 2 weeks post-treatment) but not at long-term follow-up or on clinical outcomes. Patients preferred single dose treatment (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.88) to long-course treatments, but this was based on one study comparing different antibiotics. Short versus longer treatments showed no significant difference in efficacy. Rate of adverse drug reactions increased significantly with longer treatment durations in only one study.

Authors' Conclusions

Short-course treatment (3 to 6 days) could be sufficient for treating uncomplicated UTIs in elderly women, although more studies on specific commonly prescribed antibiotics are needed.

### Antibiotic management of urinary tract infection in elderly patients in primary care and its association with bloodstream infections and all cause mortality: population based cohort study [^111GXF2V]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is the most common bacterial infection in the older patient population, and Escherichia coli is the most common uropathogen in community dwelling people older than 65 years. The spectrum of UTI ranges from a mild self limiting illness to severe sepsis, with a mortality rate of 20–40%. The incidence of sepsis and its associated mortality increases disproportionately with age, and UTI in men is more likely to be severe. Both sexes develop UTI in old age, with a female to male ratio of 2:1 in patients older than 70 years, compared with the overwhelming UTI susceptibility of females in younger populations, with a 50:1 ratio. The diagnosis of UTI in older patients can be problematic, as these patients are less likely to present with a typical clinical history and localised urinary symptoms compared with younger patients. The rising incidence of asymptomatic bacteriuria in older adults is also contributing to further diagnostic difficulty (> 20% of women aged ≥ 65 years compared with < 5% in younger women), which results in probable over-diagnosis of UTI and unnecessary treatment.

UTI is the second most common diagnosis for which empirical antibiotics are prescribed in both primary and secondary care, with more than 50% of the antibiotics prescribed for a suspected UTI in older adults being considered unnecessary. With the spread of antibiotic resistance and its increasing threat to public health (about 30% of urinary isolates of E coli are now resistant to trimethoprim), national guidelines and antimicrobial stewardship programmes have been proposed to combat these challenges.NHS England, for example, released the Quality Premium to incentivise Clinical Commissioning Groups to reduce antibiotic use in primary care. As a result of these new initiatives, a substantial decrease in antibiotic use has been reported for the first time in England across the whole healthcare system between 2013 and 2017. A recent study has also shown a decrease in prescribing of broad spectrum antibiotics for UTI in older people in primary care between 2004 and 2014. In the meantime, however, increases in the incidence of Gram negative bloodstream infections have been reported, which has led the UK government to announce a plan to reduce healthcare associated Gram negative bloodstream infections in England by 50% by March 2021.

### Unnecessary antibiotics in older female patients with recurrent urinary tract infections [^114ycBw6]. International Urogynecology Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Our aim was to describe the rate of unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions across specialties and the frequency of clinical scenarios in which the unnecessary antibiotics were prescribed in older female patients with recurrent urinary tract infections (UTI).

Methods

This was a retrospective cohort study of female patients 65 or older with a clinical diagnosis of recurrent UTI. An unnecessary antibiotic was defined as an antibiotic prescribed (i) for asymptomatic bacteriuria (positive culture in the absence of UTI-specific symptoms), (ii) in the absence of UTI-specific symptoms, or (iii) in the presence of documented negative urine culture or negative pyuria. Data on clinical scenarios during episodes when an unnecessary antibiotic was prescribed (such as symptom documentation, urine testing) were extracted and described.

Results

The overall rate of unnecessary antibiotics across 454 episodes of antibiotic prescriptions in 175 older female patients with recurrent UTI was 41% and did not significantly differ between specialties (primary care 45%, urogynecology 41%, obstetrics-gynecology 29%, urology 28%, urgent care 27%, p = 0.06). The commonest clinical scenario during which an unnecessary antibiotic was prescribed was absence of documented UTI-specific symptoms (60%) followed by asymptomatic bacteriuria (46%). Other clinical scenarios associated with unnecessary antibiotics included antibiotics prescribed with documented negative pyuria (32%) or negative urine culture (18%). In 11% of episodes, antibiotics were prescribed without any documented UTI-specific symptom and without any testing.

Conclusion

Inadequate symptom documentation and inappropriate urine testing contribute to a high rate of unnecessary antibiotic prescribing in older female patients with recurrent UTI. Clinical decision support tools that address these gaps could promote antibiotic stewardship.

### Pragmatic randomised trial assessing the impact of peer comparison and therapeutic recommendations, including repetition, on antibiotic prescribing patterns of family physicians across British Columbia for uncomplicated lower urinary tract infections [^1112yrSy]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2025). High credibility.

Participants

FPs were included if they (1) were registered by the BC Medical Services Plan with a specialty in family medicine, (2) had a valid BC mailing address, (3) were active prescribers with ≥ 100 prescriptions in 2020 and (4) prescribed an oral antibiotic to at least one eligible patient with UTI in 2019–2020. Eligible physicians (n = 5073) were randomised into the three trial arms. Physicians who opted out of the programme were excluded from the intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis (n = 20) for ethical considerations. Physicians with an invalid mailing address were excluded from the per-protocol (PP) analysis (n = 215).

Patient data were included in the AF if they: (1) Were women, (2) had a physician visit with a diagnosis of UTI between 27 December 2018 and 31 December 2020, (3) were dispensed an oral antibiotic prescription within 5 days of the physician visit for UTI during the study period, (4) had provincial health insurance and (5) were at least 15 years old at the time of the oral antibiotic dispensing. Antibiotics were identified by Health Canada Drug Identification Numbers and are listed in online supplemental file 3.

Patient data were excluded if they met any of the following criteria on the date of their UTI physician visit (1) were pregnant in the prior 270 days, (2) had recurrent UTI, defined as a physician record of a UTI diagnosis in the prior 90 days or ≥ 4 UTI diagnoses in the prior 3 years, (3) discharged from the hospital in the previous 30 days, (4) were diagnosed with kidney infection (pyelonephritis) in the previous or following 10 days, (5) were diagnosed with chronic kidney disease in the previous 365 days, (6) had an indwelling catheter in the prior 3 months, (7) were diagnosed with impaired renal function in the previous 365 days, (8) had structural or functional abnormality of the urinary tract in the previous 365 days, (9) were diagnosed with a sexually transmissible and blood-borne infection in the previous or following 14 days, (10) were dispensed a systemic antibiotic in the prior 90 days or (11) received benefits through the provincial palliative care or long-term residential care benefit plans. Case definitions are available in online supplemental file 4.

### Consensus position statement on advancing the classification of patients and tests of cure in studies of antibiotic treatment of complicated urinary tract infections [^111ndMsp]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2025). High credibility.

Complicated urinary tract infections denote an important research field for new antibiotics against Gram-negative pathogens. There is, however, increasing concern that this disease entity is too vaguely defined, leading to heterogeneous study populations and risk of bias. We analysed researchers' adherence to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidance on complicated urinary tract infection and assessed risk of bias using a three-step procedure: literature review of full-text articles on complicated urinary tract infection; assessment of the importance of risk factors for treatment failure, including statistical evaluation of how patients with risk factors might skew treatment effects; and a Delphi consensus process in a multidisciplinary group. Our evaluation showed poor adherence to FDA guidance on complicated urinary tract infection and significant heterogeneity in the reporting of study, patient, and pathogen characteristics, leading to a high risk of bias when interpreting and comparing study findings. We therefore question the concept of complicated urinary tract infection as a meaningful entity with its own study guidance.

In this third episode of the Microbiologist in the Clinic series, clinicians and laboratory scientists share their perspectives about a 32 y/o female who has become antibiotic-dependent for her urinary symptoms. Despite escalating methods of antibiotic administration, the patient has persistent and recurrent "UTI" symptoms. Extensive testing has not provided guidance for her treating clinicians. The challenges of this clinical presentation are discussed with evidence for evaluation and treatment.

### American Urogynecologic Society best-practice statement: recurrent urinary tract infection in adult women [^1127WTBu]. Female Pelvic Medicine & Reconstructive Surgery (2018). Medium credibility.

Recurrent urinary tract infection (rUTI) in adult women — conditional treatment and acute self-treatment: Conditional treatment uses a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug or follow-up without treatment, with antibiotics started only if symptoms progress or do not resolve, and has not been studied in women older than 65 years or with rUTI; in women younger than 65 years, resolution without antibiotics occurred in 20% to 47%, but one study reported pyelonephritis in the placebo group at 2% to 2.6%. In women with rUTI, acute treatment can be initiated by a clinician or patient at symptom onset, and antibiotics are traditional first-line treatment of bacterial cystitis.

### Effect of a multifaceted antibiotic stewardship intervention to improve antibiotic prescribing for suspected urinary tract infections in frail older adults (impresU): pragmatic cluster randomised controlled trial in four European countries [^116h6Qtn]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

Abstract

Objective

To evaluate whether antibiotic prescribing for suspected urinary tract infections in frail older adults can be reduced through a multifaceted antibiotic stewardship intervention.

Design

Pragmatic, parallel, cluster randomised controlled trial, with a five month baseline period and a seven month follow-up period.

Setting

38 clusters consisting of one or more general practices (n = 43) and older adult care organisations (n = 43) in Poland, the Netherlands, Norway, and Sweden, from September 2019 to June 2021.

Participants

1041 frail older adults aged 70 or older (Poland 325, the Netherlands 233, Norway 276, Sweden 207), contributing 411 person years to the follow-up period.

Intervention

Healthcare professionals received a multifaceted antibiotic stewardship intervention consisting of a decision tool for appropriate antibiotic use, supported by a toolbox with educational materials. A participatory-action-research approach was used for implementation, with sessions for education, evaluation, and local tailoring of the intervention. The control group provided care as usual.

Main outcome measures

The primary outcome was the number of antibiotic prescriptions for suspected urinary tract infections per person year. Secondary outcomes included the incidence of complications, all cause hospital referrals, all cause hospital admissions, all cause mortality within 21 days after suspected urinary tract infections, and all cause mortality.

Results

The numbers of antibiotic prescriptions for suspected urinary tract infections in the follow-up period were 54 prescriptions in 202 person years (0.27 per person year) in the intervention group and 121 prescriptions in 209 person years (0.58 per person year) in the usual care group. Participants in the intervention group had a lower rate of receiving an antibiotic prescription for a suspected urinary tract infection compared with participants in the usual care group, with a rate ratio of 0.42 (95% confidence interval 0.26 to 0.68). No differences between intervention and control group were observed in the incidence of complications (< 0.01 v 0.05 per person year), hospital referrals (< 0.01 v 0.05), admissions to hospital (0.01 v 0.05), and mortality (0 v 0.01) within 21 days after suspected urinary tract infections, nor in all cause mortality (0.26 v 0.26).

Conclusions

Implementation of a multifaceted antibiotic stewardship intervention safely reduced antibiotic prescribing for suspected urinary tract infections in frail older adults.

### Updates to recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA / CUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^116Nr2Uk]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Recurrent urinary tract infection — episode timing and management considerations indicate that episodes do not need to be in the immediate six months preceding presentation, and that recurrence burden should guide prophylaxis; expectant management may be less appropriate than active prophylaxis in an individual who has received more than three to four therapeutic courses of antibiotics in the past year. Patients with a long culture-proven history at lower-than-definition frequency (two episodes within six months within the previous year) may also be appropriate to include under the rUTI umbrella, and patients consistently presenting with one to two symptomatic infections per year for multiple years will likely benefit from a more proactive management strategy similar to that for rUTI.

### Lower urinary tract infections: management, outcomes and risk factors for antibiotic Re-prescription in primary care [^1166ebPF]. EClinicalMedicine (2019). Medium credibility.

3.3 Antibiotic Re-prescription

Antibiotic re-prescription occurred in 17,430 (4.1%) UTI episodes treated with antibiotics, ranging from 1.9% in children aged 4–15 years and in pregnant women, to 6.3% in adults aged ≥ 65 years. These re-prescription events were unrelated to antibiotic allergy or intolerance (data not shown). Antibiotic re-prescription occurred in 9859 (6.3%) episodes diagnosed in ≥ 65-year-old adults and increased slightly over time only in men (from 5.2% in 2011 to 6.2% in 2015). When defining antibiotic re-prescription using antibiotic prescribing windows of 6–28 and 8–28 days (instead of 4–28), re-prescription was observed in 14,972 (3.5%) and 11,912 (2.8%) of UTI episodes, respectively (Supplementary Table 4). Factors associated with antibiotic re-prescription are shown in Table 3. The risk increased with age, from 2.1% of episodes in patients < 10 years to 6.9% of episodes in those aged ≥ 80 years (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 0.97, 95%CI 0.84 to 1.12 for 10–19 years and 2.62, 95%CI 2.34 to 2.94 for those ≥ 80 years, compared with UTI episodes from patients aged < 10 years; p < 0.001). Odds of infection was lower in women than in men (OR = 0.77, 95%CI 0.73 to 0.80; p < 0.001) and in non-white ethnic groups (OR = 0.61, 95%CI 0.45–0.83 for black; OR = 0.75, 95%CI 0.67–0.85 for Asian; compared to white). It was slightly higher in patients with comorbidities, including cancer (OR = 1.15, 95%CI 1.09 to 1.21; p < 0.001) and diabetes (OR = 1.12, 95%CI 1.07 to 1.18; p < 0.001). Odds of re-prescription increased with shorter time since prior antibiotic use, from 1.16 (95%CI 1.09 to 1.24) for 6–12 months to 3.35 (95%CI 3.19 to 3.53) for < 1 month, compared with non-use in the previous year (p < 0.001). Initial treatment of the UTI with antibiotics other than trimethoprim was associated with a higher odds of re-prescription (OR = 1.18, 95%CI 1.10 to 1.27 for co-amoxiclav; OR = 1.56, 95%CI 1.30 to 1.86 for pivmecillinam; OR = 8.98, 95%CI 8.18 to 9.85 for multiple concomitant antibiotics; compared with trimethoprim) except for nitrofurantoin (OR = 0.96, 95%CI 0.92 to 1.00). Furthermore, the odds of re-prescription of any antibiotic increased over time (OR = 1.20, 95%CI 1.14 to 1.27 in 2015 compared with 2011; p < 0.001).

### Importance of urinary tract infection to antibiotic use among hospitalized patients [^116CrwHV]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2009). Low credibility.

Many patients with asymptomatic bacteriuria receive extended courses of broad-spectrum antibiotics. Antibiotic use was analyzed in patients admitted to the hospital with urinary tract infection. Strategies to optimize antibiotic use for such patients are discussed and include implementing a process whereby a urine culture is automatically performed if a urinalysis result suggests infection.

### Updates to recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA / CUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^113AurP1]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infection (rUTI) antimicrobial therapy and stewardship — use of new agents and prescribing strategies: "Promising new antimicrobials such as the first oral carbapenem, sulopenem, may also provide outpatient therapies for patients with high multidrug resistance or antibiotic-intolerant individuals at high risk of infection progression", yet "these agents should still be reserved for those with high multidrug resistance". For prescribing practices, "It may be reasonable to consider collaboration with infectious disease specialists before prescribing to reduce unnecessary prescribing". Regarding prevention, "Preliminary data suggests that continuous prophylaxis with low-dose antibiotics leads to lower rates of antibiotic resistance and fewer adverse events than intermittent treatment of symptomatic episodes", while "little is understood about the short- and long-term consequences of antibiotic use, particularly intermittent, high-dose use".

### Antibiotic management of urinary tract infection in elderly patients in primary care and its association with bloodstream infections and all cause mortality: population based cohort study [^116wRgyo]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

Covariates

A set of covariates was described and used in the models to adjust for potential sources of confounding. Covariates included age (defined as a categorical variable: 65–74, 75–84, and ≥ 85 years), sex, grouped regions (defined as a categorical variable: North of England and Yorkshire, Midlands and east of England, south of England, and London), area level deprivation (index of multiple deprivation) divided into fifths (first fifth being the least deprived and last fifth the most deprived), year of consultations/diagnoses (financial years from May to April to account for changes in NHS England quality premium guidance), Charlson comorbidity score (scale from 0 to 12, with higher scores indicating increased risk of death within a year) (see supplementary table S3), immunosuppression, smoking status, medical history 30 days before the index UTI (indwelling urethral catheter, hospital admission with a discharge date within the 30 days before the index case, antibiotic exposure including short course or prophylactic treatment, presenting symptoms potentially related to UTI), and a history of recurrent UTIs.

We defined a recurrent UTI as the presence of a Read code for recurrent UTI or prophylactic treatment for UTI (trimethoprim or nitrofurantoin prescribed for ≥ 28 days) or two or more UTIs within 12 months. Although recurrent UTI is usually defined as two or more UTIs within six months or three or more within 12 months, we adapted this definition to account for the 90 day period between each index case to allow for distinct UTI episodes.

When data were missing on binary covariates, we classified these as absence of the condition.

### Frequency and predictors of suboptimal prescribing among a cohort of older male residents with urinary tract infections [^111E9UUU]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Unnecessary antibiotic treatment of suspected urinary tract infections (UTI) is common in long-term care facilities (LTCFs). However, less is known about the extent of suboptimal treatment, in terms of antibiotic choice, dose, and duration, after the decision to use antibiotics has been made.

Methods

We described the frequency of potentially suboptimal treatment among residents with an incident UTI (the first during the study with none in the year prior) in Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) community living centers (CLCs; 2013–2018). Time trends were analyzed using Joinpoint regression. Residents with UTIs receiving potentially suboptimal treatment were compared with those receiving optimal treatment, to identify resident characteristics predictive of suboptimal antibiotic treatment, using multivariable unconditional logistic regression models.

Results

We identified 21938 residents with an incident UTI treated in 120 VA CLCs, of whom 96.0% were male. Potentially suboptimal antibiotic treatment was identified in 65.0% of residents and decreased 1.8% annually (P < .05). Potentially suboptimal initial drug choice was identified in 45.6% of residents, suboptimal dose frequency in 28.6%, and longer than recommended duration in 12.7%. Predictors of suboptimal antibiotic treatment included prior fluoroquinolone exposure (adjusted odds ratio, 1.38), chronic renal disease (1.19), age ≥ 85 years (1.17), prior skin infection (1.14), recent high white blood cell count (1.08), and genitourinary disorder (1.08).

Conclusion

Similar to findings in non-VA facilities, potentially suboptimal treatment was common but improving in CLC residents with an incident UTI. Predictors of suboptimal antibiotic treatment should be targeted with antibiotic stewardship interventions to improve UTI treatment.

### Lower urinary tract infections: management, outcomes and risk factors for antibiotic Re-prescription in primary care [^115wWZLz]. EClinicalMedicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are major drivers of antibiotic prescribing in primary care. Inappropriate antibiotic prescribing for UTIs likely drives antibiotic resistance. We aimed to describe current investigation and antibiotic treatment to examine opportunities for improved antimicrobial stewardship.

Methods

We identified a cohort of all patients with lower UTI diagnosis between 2011 and 2015 in the 390 primary care practices contributing data to ResearchOne in England. We examined investigation, antibiotic treatment and antibiotic re-prescription within 28 days according to guideline-defined patient groups. We assessed risk factors for re-prescription using mixed-effect logistic regression.

Findings

In total, 494,675 UTIs were diagnosed in 300,354 patients. Median age was 54 years, and 83.3% were women. Same-day antibiotic was prescribed for 85.7% of UTIs; 56.8% were treated with trimethoprim, and urine sampling was undertaken in 25.0%. The antibiotic re-prescription rate was low (17,430, 4.1%) and increased slightly over time in men (from 5.2% in 2011 to 6.2% in 2015). Overall, 21.1% of pre-prescription were for the same antibiotic. The percentage of adults with recurrent UTIs ranged from 1.0% in 18–64 year-old men to 2.6% in women ≥ 65 years. The risk of antibiotic re-prescription increased with age, calendar year, recent antibiotic prescribing and treatment with antibiotic other than trimethoprim or nitrofurantoin.

Interpretation

Most patients diagnosed with lower UTI in primary care receive same-day empirical antibiotics with little diversity in choice of agent. The antibiotic re-prescription rate is low. Microbiological investigation and re-prescription of the same antibiotic given for the initial episode happened in one quarter of UTIs.

### Top ten myths regarding the diagnosis and treatment of urinary Tract infections [^112qavMU]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Urinary tract infections (UTI) are the most common type of infection in the United States. A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report in March 2014 regarding antibiotic use in hospitals reported "UTI" treatment was avoidable at least 39% of the time. The accurate diagnosis and treatment of UTI plays an important role in cost-effective medical care and appropriate antimicrobial utilization.

Objective

We summarize the most common misperceptions of UTI that result in extraneous testing and excessive antimicrobial treatment. We present 10 myths associated with the diagnosis and treatment of UTI and succinctly review the literature pertaining to each myth. We explore the myths associated with pyuria, asymptomatic bacteriuria, candiduria, and the elderly and catheterized patients. We attempt to give guidance for clinicians facing these clinical scenarios.

Discussion

From our ambulatory, emergency department, and hospital experiences, patients often have urine cultures ordered without an appropriate indication, or receive unnecessary antibiotic therapy due to over-interpretation of the urinalysis.

Conclusions

Asymptomatic bacteriuria is common in all age groups and is frequently over-treated. A UTI diagnosis should be based on a combination of clinical symptoms with supportive laboratory information. This review will assist providers in navigating common pitfalls in the diagnosis of UTI.

### Poor clinical outcomes associated with suboptimal antibiotic treatment among older long-term care facility residents with urinary tract infection: a retrospective cohort study [^116RN1TG]. BMC Geriatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

In this large national study of 19,701 CLC residents with an incident UTI, suboptimal antibiotic treatment was associated with increased risk of poor clinical outcomes. Our results were driven by a 94% increased risk of CDI with suboptimal use, meaning not unnecessary use, but not the use of the best drug, dose frequency, and duration. Our work expands on previous work which has found that antibiotic use and unnecessary antibiotic use are associated with a number of harms in vulnerable older long-term care residents. Beyond the decision to use antibiotics, clinicians should consider the potential harms of their antibiotic choices with regards to drug, dose, and duration, to ensure that residents are receiving the most optimal antibiotic treatment. Future research should continue to investigate the impact of suboptimal treatment UTI and other common types of infection among older vulnerable long-term care residents.

### Complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI): clinical guidelines for treatment and management [^111s2fcA]. IDSA (2025). High credibility.

Patient-specific risk factors for resistant uropathogens — recent antibiotic class exposure: In patients with complicated UTI (including acute pyelonephritis), we suggest avoiding fluoroquinolones if the patient has been exposed to that class of antibiotic in the past 12 months (conditional recommendation, very low certainty of evidence). Remarks note that more recent antibiotic exposure may be a better guide than more distant antibiotic exposure.

### Ten golden rules for optimal antibiotic use in hospital settings: the WARNING call to action [^116GPoUX]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Antibiotic therapy should be prescribed after a bacterial infection has been confirmed. Colonization by potential pathogens without associated signs of infection occurs frequently in certain patients (e.g. those with indwelling urinary catheters, endotracheal tubes for mechanical ventilation, chronic wounds). Appropriate evaluation requires obtaining a culture from these sites only when indicated, without contamination by the collection protocol itself (superficial swab cultures and cultures of drains and sinus tracts are inappropriate), and avoiding antibiotic treatment of a "positive" culture result without symptoms and signs of active infection. Asymptomatic bacteriuria is a common scenario for which antibiotics are not recommended, yet it is often treated regardless. Patients with a urinary drainage catheter may have "positive" urine culture results owing to inevitable biofilm formation on the device. Numerous studies show that antibiotic treatment of patients with asymptomatic bacteriuria is not indicated except in specific circumstances, such as pregnancy or transurethral instrumentation, because it can increase the likelihood of subsequent urinary tract infections that can become resistant to common antibiotics.

The use of antibiotics in the treatment of mild uncomplicated diverticulitis has been common, but is now being questioned. Mounting evidence suggests that mild uncomplicated diverticulitis is more likely to be an inflammatory rather than an infectious condition, questioning the appropriateness of antibiotic use. Three randomized trials each showed that antibiotic treatment neither prevents complications or recurrences nor reduces symptoms or length of hospital stay, as did two prospective cohort studies. The results of these studies have led some experts to advocate against the routine use of antibiotics.

### Urinary tract infection in women over the age of 65: is age alone a marker of complication? [^112bWJbi]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Background

We were interested to know if our older female patients with urinary tract infections (UTIs) might have differing pathogens or rates of Escherichia coli antibiotic sensitivity and if our physicians managed them in a manner similar or dissimilar to the care provided to younger patients with no complications.

Methods

This was a secondary analysis from patients excluded from a previous retrospective study regarding uncomplicated UTIs.

Results

Twenty-six percent of total patients with UTIs were older than 65 and otherwise medically uncomplicated whereas 21% were older patients who did have complicating factors. E. coli was a pathogen in 81% of uncomplicated elders' and 54% of complicated elders' cultures. E. coli sensitivity rate to sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (SMX/TMP) in both groups was 86%. Physicians were significantly less likely to prescribe SMX/TMP for complicated older patients with complications than for young patients with an uncomplicated UTI (P = 0.017); there was a significant trend of physicians to be less likely to prescribe SMX/TMP with advancing age in a patient and complications across all 3 groups (P = 0.011). Antibiotics rarely needed to be changed after cultures.

Conclusions

The presence of E. coli on culture in patients with a UTI changes based on medical complications, not age. Being medically complex did not result in reduced sensitivity of E. coli to SMX/TMP but was associated with increased rates of the presence of other pathogens. In our setting, treatment employed with SMX/TMP and without the use of culture and sensitivity may be effective for appropriately selected older women. Prospective studies are needed to determine the optimal approach to management.

### Updates to recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA / CUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^11619zp2]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Education and informed decision-making — supportive care and risk of progression note that the prevalence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria is enhanced by the unnecessary antibiotic treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria and that the diagnosis of UTI is highly imprecise. While no evidence exists to support the concept of withholding antimicrobials to patients with rUTIs, substantial effort should be made to avoid unnecessary treatment unless there is a high suspicion of UTI. For patients with episodes of acute cystitis without complicating factors, there is minimal risk of progression to tissue invasion or pyelonephritis, and additional characteristics of great concern do not reliably indicate risk or presence of bacteremic bacteriuria or pyelonephritis. In a representative study of older patients with bacteremia who had the same bacterial species cultured from the urine, only 1 of 37 participants aged 75 years and older had symptoms consistent with UTI, such as dysuria. Multiple randomized placebo-controlled trials have demonstrated that antibiotic treatment for acute cystitis offers little but mildly faster symptomatic improvement compared to placebo in patients with acute dysuria and significant bacteriuria, and the incidence of pyelonephritis in these patients is low and is not substantially different in individuals receiving antibiotics versus those treated with supportive care of analgesics and hydration; expectant management with analgesics and hydration while awaiting culture results is likely underutilized.

### American Geriatrics Society identifies five things that healthcare providers and patients should question [^1163WsEd]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2013). Medium credibility.

American Geriatrics Society — management of asymptomatic bacteriuria in older adults — recommends: "Don't use antimicrobials to treat bacteriuria in older adults unless specific urinary tract symptoms are present". The rationale notes "Cohort studies have found no adverse outcomes for older men or women associated with asymptomatic bacteriuria" and "Antimicrobial treatment studies for asymptomatic bacteriuria in older adults demonstrate no benefits and show increased adverse antimicrobial effects". It specifies an exception: "Screening for and treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria is recommended before urologic procedures for which mucosal bleeding is anticipated".

### Diagnosis and management of urinary tract infection in older adults [^1171Mf6J]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is a commonly diagnosed infection in older adults. Despite consensus guidelines developed to assist providers in diagnosing UTI, distinguishing symptomatic UTI from asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) in older adults is problematic, as many older adults do not present with localized genitourinary symptoms. This article summarizes the recent literature and guidelines on the diagnosis and management of UTI and ASB in older adults.

### Unnecessary antibiotics in older female patients with recurrent urinary tract infections [^111QATTh]. International Urogynecology Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Analysis of the 454 episodes where an antibiotic for UTI was prescribed showed the median number of UTI-specific symptoms documented was 1 (IQR 0–2). No UTI-specific symptom was documented in 111 (24%) episodes. Nonspecific symptoms such as back pain in the absence of documented flank pain (7%), mental changes (e.g. confusion, forgetfulness) (6%), and fatigue (6%) were recorded in 119 (26.2%) episodes. In 17 encounters (3.7%), only nonspecific symptoms were documented.

Urinalysis reports were available for 70% of episodes, urine microscopy for 54%, and urine culture for 81%. Pyuria ≥ 10/hpf was present in 41% (n = 186) of episodes. Urine culture was positive for 339 (75% of all episodes) and negative for 30 (7% of all episodes).

Characteristics of the antibiotics prescribed by specialty during 454 episodes of UTI are presented in Table 1. The proportion of episodes treated by specialty included primary care (61.8%), obstetrics and gynecology (9.2%), urogynecology (16%), urology (8%), and ED/urgent care (4.8%). The overall rate of empirical antibiotics with concurrent testing was 51% and differed significantly across specialties ranging from 95% in ED to 34% in obstetrics/gynecology (p < .001). The rate of empirical antibiotics without concurrent testing was also significantly different across specialties being highest in primary care (19%, p = .03).

### Linezolid bladder irrigation as adjunctive treatment for a vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium catheter-associated urinary tract infection [^115Mc1fW]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe the first reported successful use of adjunctive linezolid bladder irrigation.

Case Summary

An 89-year-old woman with 10% TBSA burns developed septic shock and anuric acute kidney insufficiency. She acquired a urinary tract infection caused by vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VREfm). Based on clinical status, a linezolid bladder irrigation was initiated in addition to high-dose intravenous linezolid and demonstrated microbiological cure with 7 days of treatment.

Discussion

Linezolid is primarily hepatically cleared and has no labeled indication for urinary tract infections. Anuria adds an additional complication of potentially reduced urinary drug concentrations. Bladder irrigation offers the benefit of achieving high local drug concentrations, but there are no data regarding such a route for linezolid. This case report is the first demonstrating the use, stability, safety, and efficacy of linezolid as a continuous bladder irrigation.

Conclusions

Linezolid use as a bladder irrigation may be a feasible route of administration in anuric, critically ill patients with VREfm and few antimicrobial options. Further studies are warranted.

### Urinary tract infections in adults… [^1143JJsA]. AAFP (1999). Low credibility.

On the basis of cost and efficacy, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole remains the antibiotic of choice in the treatment of uncomplicated UTIs in young women. The use of fluoroquinolones as first-line therapy for uncomplicated UTIs should be discouraged, except in patients who cannot tolerate sulfonamides or trimethoprim, who have a high frequency of antibiotic resistance because of recent antibiotic treatment or who reside in an area in which significant resistance to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole has been noted. Continuous daily prophylaxis with one of these regimens for a period of six months: trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, one-half tablet per day; nitrofurantoin, 50 to 100 mg per day; norfloxacin, 200 mg per day; cephalexin, 250 mg per day; or trimethoprim, 100 mg per day. Each of these regimens has been shown to decrease the morbidity of recurrent UTIs without a concomitant increase in antibiotic resistance.

Long-term studies have shown antibiotic prophylaxis to be effective for up to five years with trimethoprim, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole or nitrofurantoin, without the emergence of drug resistance. 3, 19 Unfortunately, antibiotic prophylaxis does not appear to alter the natural history of recurrences because 40 to 60 percent of these women reestablish their pattern or frequency of infections within six months of stopping prophylaxis.
19. In patients who are unable to tolerate oral medication or who require hospitalization for concomitant medical problems, appropriate initial therapy may be parenteral administration of one of the following: a third-generation cephalosporin with antipseudomonal activity such as ceftazidime or cefoperazone. Patients with complicated UTIs require at least a 10- to 14-day course of therapy. Follow-up urine cultures should be performed within 10 to 14 days after treatment to ensure that the uropathogen has been eradicated.

Recent studies have shown that patients initially placed on parenteral therapy can be switched to oral therapy within 72 hours as long as they are clinically improving and able to tolerate the oral agent, and a regimen is available that covers the identified pathogen. Symptomatic urinary tract infections complicate 1 to 2 percent of pregnancies, usually in women with persistent bacteriuria.

### Unnecessary antibiotics in older female patients with recurrent urinary tract infections [^113gyhYB]. International Urogynecology Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Results

The electronic search based on the diagnosis code of recurrent UTI identified 557 eligible patients during the study period. Following manual chart review, 382 patients were excluded for the following reasons: did not meet definition of recurrent UTI (n = 265), no visit during the study period (n = 100), renal transplant (n = 6), cancer or anatomic anomaly of urinary tract (n = 6), or indwelling catheter (n = 5). Data of 175 patients who contributed a total of 454 encounters during which an antibiotic was prescribed are described in the following analysis.

Median age at the time of recurrent UTI diagnosis was 76 (interquartile range (IQR) (72–85). Most patients identified as White (85%), 6% as Black, 3% as Hispanic, and 9% as other races. All patients had insurance with the majority having Medicare (91%). The most common comorbidities were overactive bladder (34%) and urinary incontinence (32%).

Of the 175 patients, 85 (48.5%) were in the low SVI (lowest social vulnerability), 44 (25%) in the mid-low, 25 (14%) in mid-high, and 21 (12%) in the high (greatest social vulnerability) groups. SVI was associated with race (p = .001) and primary language (p = .002) with the high SVI group having the highest proportion of non-white patients (62%) and lowest rate of patients whose primary language was English (86%). There were no significant associations of SVI with BMI, insurance, comorbidities, or ever seeing a urology/urogynecology specialist (overall rate 30%). Patients in the high SVI (most vulnerable) group had the lowest rate of UTI episodes treated by a primary care clinician (48% vs. 51% vs. 79% vs 60%, p = .001), highest rate of ever obtaining care in the emergency department (ED)/urgent care (33% vs 20% vs 5% vs 8%, p = .003), and highest rate of caregiver involvement (62% vs 36% vs 29% vs 20%, p = .002) (all rates listed as high vs mid-high vs mid-low vs low SVI).

Duration of therapy and oral step-down — guidance principles: Recommendations on durations of therapy are not provided, and durations may vary if initially inactive therapy was given; uncomplicated cystitis is typically mild and, if clinical improvement occurs despite empiric inactive therapy, it is generally not necessary to repeat urine culture, change the regimen, or extend the planned course, whereas for other infections if AST later indicates inactive empiric therapy, a change to an active regimen for a full treatment course (dated from the start of active therapy) is suggested; host factors and source control should inform duration decisions, and transitioning to oral therapy should be considered when susceptibility to an appropriate oral agent is demonstrated, the patient is hemodynamically stable, source control measures have occurred, and there are no concerns about insufficient intestinal absorption.

Communication with patients and ICGs

Diverse scenarios regarding communication between HCPs, patients and ICGs were shared in the interviews. Across all countries, HCPs reported to have felt pressured to perform urine tests or to prescribe antibiotics. Often, HCPs noted to experience pressure mostly from relatives, and to a lesser extent from patients themselves. In many older adults, they observed a compliant attitude (q101–104). Indeed, while some patients voiced the expectation to receive antibiotics in case of a UTI suspicion (' you should stick to what works', SE_P_01), many patients and ICGs reported to have trust in the HCPs, also in case of refraining from treatment (q105–107). Beyond this, several patients reported not to participate in the decision-making (' I don't discuss drugs because I don't know. I take what the nurses give me', PL_P_02). Possibly, the patient may not always be involved due to all intermediaries in the communication, or because a cystitis may be considered a triviality (q108–111). Moreover, it was pointed out that HCPs sometimes forget to inform relatives when their family member has a UTI, which may harm the relation between HCPs and the next of kin (q111, q112). Retaining a good relation was described as a factor in the decision-making (' in order not to lose good relations with the patient, it happens that I prescribe an antibiotic', PL_GP_01); however, HCPs also reported that refraining from treatment is usually accepted by patients and relatives, when there is a good relation with the family, and when the decision is well-communicated (q113–115).

The percentages represent the proportion of patients with each characteristic, relative to the total number of patients included in the category (e.g. not circumcised percentages only apply to males)

Some patients presented with more than one condition and may appear in more than one category (i.e.two patient with DCS and Sb/Nb and one patient with DCS and UPJO)

* Excludes patients with another condition (Sb/Nb, DCS or UPJO)

Patients with VUR, with or without Sb/Nb, DCS or UPJO

† The listed antibiotics include all antibiotics administered, regardless of whether they were the first or subsequent antibiotics prescribed

± VUR present in patients with Sb/Nb, DCS or UPJO

Compared with patients without the medical condition, patients with UPJO (p < 0.01) and severe VUR (p = 0.02) had more hydronephrosis while patients with Sb/Nb had more bladder dysfunction (p < 0.001), more constipation (p = 0.04) and less renal scar detected (p = 0.05). Nearly half of patients with Sb/Nb, DCS or UPJO also had VUR, including 63% of patients with DCS. Among DCS patients, 38% had a ureterocele, and 17% an ectopic ureter. 70% of Sb/Nb patients used clean intermittent catheterization (CIC), while 24% used diapers and 6% had a vesicostomy.

Most patients received prophylaxis (87%), including all those with VUR (Table 1). The median age for initiating prophylaxis was 1.2 years (IQR 0.4, 4.1), with Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) being the most prescribed (89%), followed by cephalexin (31%), nitrofurantoin (26%), and amoxicillin (17%), depending on doctor's preference or patient's tolerance to the antimicrobial. Furthermore, 53% of patients received more than one prophylactic antimicrobial, as physicians prescribed cycling of classes. This approach was used in 60% of patients with severe VUR. The median age at first infection was 0.4 years (IQR 0.2, 0.7).

### Is non-steroidal anti-inflammatory therapy non-inferior to antibiotic therapy in uncomplicated urinary tract infections: a systematic review [^113955L9]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Furthermore, even patients with "positive" urine cultures may have asymptomatic bacteriuria and thus not require treatment. Misdiagnosis of UTI is particularly common in elderly women who have other long-standing urinary tract symptoms, such as incontinence. – However, the maximum age cutoffs used in four out of five studies (50 to 70 years of age) likely avoided some challenges of diagnosing UTIs in the elderly — while also limiting generalizability to these groups. In summary, although there is a subset of individuals who clearly benefit from antibiotics, there is likely another segment that does not benefit from antibiotics and could be appropriately treated with NSAIDs or no therapy.

Another important finding from the included studies was that only 2.0–4.5% of individuals treated with NSAIDs subsequently developed pyelonephritis (based on 3 studies with 1130 patients). Thus, to avoid one case of pyelonephritis, 22 to 62 people would need to be treated with antibiotics. Notably, these reported rates of pyelonephritis in NSAID groups were higher than placebo arms of prior clinical trials (0.4%and 2.6%). While better follow-up to assess outcomes in the NSAID studies may be partially responsible, NSAIDs have also been associated with worse outcomes in other infections, such as community-acquired pneumonia, possibly due to immune suppresion. These and other potential adverse effects of NSAIDs must be better understood before these drugs can be used for uncomplicated UTI.

In summary, this review demonstrates the superiority of antibiotics over NSAIDs for the treatment of uncomplicated UTIs. However, future research should focus on better diagnosing UTI and stratifying women with uncomplicated UTIs to identify the subset that would benefit from antibiotic treatment while avoiding unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions. Other potential antibiotic-sparing strategies should be further explored as well, including delayed antibiotic prescriptions for lingering symptoms only, point-of-care testing–driven prescribing algorithms, and provider audit reports and reminders. Given the high incidence of uncomplicated UTIs (and likely misdiagnosed UTIs) as well as the number of antibiotic prescriptions written for these infections, elimination of even a quarter of antibiotic prescriptions for uncomplicated UTIs would result in tens of thousands fewer antibiotic courses per year. Such a shift in practice patterns could have significant downstream ramifications, including reducing the number of adverse drug reactions, Clostridium difficile infections, and multi-drug resistant organisms.

### Current pyuria cutoffs promote inappropriate urinary tract infection diagnosis in older women [^113tT1po]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

In conclusion, the degree of pyuria should be taken into account when evaluating older women for UTI. Current pyuria cutoffs for UTI are too low and promote inappropriate UTI diagnosis in this population, affecting patient care, antimicrobial stewardship efforts, and research. The impact of higher cutoff values on prescription behavior and UTI-related outcomes in older women deserves further study.

### Effectiveness of five different approaches in management of urinary tract infection: randomised controlled trial [^111unxWW]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Results

Most general practitioners recruited few patients, citing lack of time as the major reason. Of those patients invited, most accepted, and there was no difference in characteristics of this patient group with those in other observational studies. There were no important differences by management group for the key baseline variables of age, symptom severity, past cystitis, somatic symptom inventory, and comorbidities (table 1). Although marital status did differ slightly by group, inclusion of this factor in the models did not confound the estimates.

There were also differences in the number where dipstick results were documented (immediate antibiotics 50% (33/66), midstream urine 52% (28/54), dipstick 95% (55/58), symptom score 55% (38/69), delayed antibiotics 29% (18/62); χ² = 55; P < 0.001). Including these variables in the models (that is, whether or not a midstream urine sample was sent or a dipstick result documented) did not alter the estimates of the main outcomes.

### Antibiotic overprescription for "Urinary tract infections" is associated with poor diagnostic stewardship and low adherence to guidelines [^113AAffU]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2025). Medium credibility.

5 Conclusions

Our data continue to support evidence that UTIs are often diagnosed and treated in a manner inconsistent with guidelines meant to direct best clinical practices. Laboratory tests are frequently used in the absence of urinary symptoms demonstrating inappropriate testing. Over‐testing is contributing to the overtreatment of patients without UTI symptoms and often without microbiological evidence of infection. Given the potential harms of overtreatment such as antibiotic resistance, recurrent infections, and high healthcare costs, our study demonstrates the need for advances in adherence to and understanding of UTI diagnostic criteria and treatment guidelines as well as improved diagnostic and antimicrobial stewardship.

### Antibiotic prescribing patterns and guideline concordance for uncomplicated urinary tract infections among adult women in the US military health system [^111Fwqju]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Results

Between October 1, 2017, and September 30, 2019, there were 46 793 US women diagnosed with an uncomplicated UTI. Detailed patient demographic characteristics and clinical characteristics are presented in Table 1. Most patients were aged 18 to 34 years (67.3% [31 475 of 46 793]), of White race (38.2% [17 859 of 46 793]), and most had 1 UTI during the study period (85.9% [40 225 of 46 793]). Additional clinical characteristics associated with the first UTI during the study period are presented in Table 2. Most women received IDSA guideline-concordant treatment (91.0% [42 583 of 46 793]) and received care in the direct care setting (56.8% [26 580 of 46 793]). The IDSA guideline concordance rate was 92.5% in direct care and 89.0% in private sector care. Differences in UTI diagnosis by specialties and care settings were also examined (eTable 2 in the Supplement). The specialties with the highest diagnostic rates in direct care were clinicians with unknown specialties (34.2%), primary care (23.3%), and emergency medicine (18.9%). In private sector care, the specialties with the highest diagnostic rates were clinicians with other specialties (32.9%), family medicine (25.3%), and clinicians with unknown specialties (14.9%).

### Antibiotic management of urinary tract infection in elderly patients in primary care and its association with bloodstream infections and all cause mortality: population based cohort study [^111KgKpK]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

For 7.2% (n = 22 534) of the UTI episodes a record of an antibiotic prescription in primary care was lacking and 6.2% (n = 19 292) were related to a delay in antibiotic prescribing. For those participants prescribed antibiotics for a UTI episode, 73.8% (n = 200 078) received either trimethoprim (54.7%; n = 148 333) or nitrofurantoin (19.1%; n = 51 745); cephalosporins or amoxicillin/clavulanic acid were prescribed for 11.5% (n = 31 090) and 9.5% (n = 25 616) of these episodes, respectively, whereas quinolones were prescribed in 4.4% (n = 11 995). Pivmecillinam, which was only included among recommended first line treatments in PHE guidelines in October 2014, was prescribed for 0.4% (n = 1084) of these episodes (table 2).27

Patients older than 85 years, living in a deprived area, with a high Charlson comorbidity index score, were mainly managed using either deferred antibiotics or a no antibiotics approach, whereas patients aged between 65 and 74 years were mainly prescribed immediate antibiotics. The female:male ratio was also much higher in the immediate antibiotics group compared with the other groups. A course of antibiotics was more often prescribed at the first visit to the GP or with a delay in patients experiencing recurrent UTIs. Patients who were prescribed antibiotics or were discharged to the hospital within 30 days before the index UTI event were more often prescribed deferred antibiotics or no antibiotics (table 1).

Overall, 7.5% (n = 23 502) of the UTI episodes involved at least one of a range of specific or non-specific signs or symptoms within 30 days before the index UTI. Pain, dysuria, micturition frequency, incontinence, and haematuria were the five most frequent symptoms encountered 30 days before a UTI was diagnosed, and 90.8% (19 666/21 668) of the participants with these symptoms recorded were prescribed antibiotics. This proportion was lower for participants with non-specific signs such as confusion (77.9%; 136/1459) and malaise (86.6%; 596/688) (table 1).

### Unnecessary antibiotics in older female patients with recurrent urinary tract infections [^116B6A4m]. International Urogynecology Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Demographic, symptoms, and antibiotic data were extracted for up to three UTI episodes closest to the time of diagnosis of recurrent UTI. Demographic data included age at time of diagnosis, race, ethnicity, body mass index (BMI), primary insurance, caregiver involvement in telephone/electronic messages, and concurrent diagnoses.

Symptoms were classified as UTI-specific symptoms specifically referrable to UTI (such as dysuria, frequency, urgency, urinary odor, worsening incontinence, suprapubic/lower abdominal pain, hematuria, fever, flank pain) or as nonspecific symptoms often attributed to UTI in clinical practice (such as fatigue, mental changes, back pain not documented as flank pain, and other poorly characterized symptoms such as "patient currently having symptoms").

Data on standard urine culture performed using standard laboratory practices in the United States were extracted. Positive urine culture was defined as > 100,000 colony forming units (cfu)/ml for at least one organism. Negative cultures included growth < 100,000 cfu/ml or mixed organisms. Asymptomatic bacteriuria was defined as the presence of bacteria thought to be a pathogen > 10,000 cfu/ml in the absence of the UTI-specific symptoms listed above.

An unnecessary antibiotic was defined as an antibiotic prescribed when any one of the following were present:
(i) Asymptomatic bacteriuria,
(ii) Absence of UTI-specific symptoms (irrespective of urine test results),
(iii) Negative urine culture,
(iv) Negative pyuria defined as < 10 white blood cells per high powered field on urine micorscopy.

This definition did not include urine dipstick results which have lower negative predictive value for clinical diagnosis of UTI in older women. An empiric antibiotic was defined as an antibiotic prescribed before obtaining results of urine testing and classified as (a) empiric with concurrent urine test order or (b) empiric without concurrent urine test order. Antibiotic resistance was defined as resistance to three or more classes of antibiotics. The specialty of the clinician prescribing the antibiotic was recorded.

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of asymptomatic bacteriuria: 2019 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^115B8tWu]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). High credibility.

Asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) in older patients with functional and/or cognitive impairment — when delirium or a fall occurs without local genitourinary or systemic signs of infection, evaluate other causes and observe rather than treat bacteriuria. In older patients with functional and/or cognitive impairment with bacteriuria and delirium and without local genitourinary symptoms or other systemic signs of infection, we recommend assessment for other causes and careful observation rather than antimicrobial treatment (strong recommendation, very low-quality evidence). In similar patients who experience a fall, we recommend assessment for other causes and careful observation rather than antimicrobial treatment of bacteriuria (strong recommendation, very low-quality evidence). This recommendation places a high value on avoiding adverse outcomes of antimicrobial therapy such as Clostridioides difficile infection, increased antimicrobial resistance, or adverse drug effects. For the bacteriuric patient with fever and other systemic signs potentially consistent with a severe infection and without a localizing source, broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy directed against urinary and nonurinary sources should be initiated.

3 Results

Of 909 patients, 85% (773/909) were female, with a mean age of 57 years of age. Of all patients, 64% (579/909) were prescribed antibiotics, although only 28% of patients exhibited symptoms consistent with UTI and only 40% and 41% of patients had positive bacteria on urinalysis or positive urine cultures, respectively (Figure 1). Only 34% of prescribed antibiotics were first‐line (Appendix SC). Of all patients, 22% were seen in an ER setting, while the remaining 78% of patients presented to outpatient medical offices. A small subset of patients (3%) had chronic UTI symptoms, while 25% had acute UTI symptoms. Patients who presented to the ER had higher levels of white blood cells (WBCs), red blood cells (RBCs), urinary squamous cells, and bacteria seen on urinalysis than patients who presented to office‐based clinical settings (Table 1).

Selection of definitive antibiotic therapy for complicated UTI — In patients with confirmed complicated UTI, we suggest selecting a definitive effective antibiotic with a targeted spectrum based on the results of urine culture (identification and susceptibility) as soon as these are available, rather than continuing empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics for the complete duration of treatment (conditional recommendation, low certainty of the evidence). The comment states that this recommendation places a high value on de-escalating antibiotic therapy based on culture results and notes that de-escalation may be less practical in cases of cUTI managed in the outpatient setting.

### European Association of Urology guidelines on urological infections: summary of the 2024 guidelines [^1135gEPy]. European Urology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background and Objective

Urological infections significantly impact the wellbeing and quality of life of individuals owing to their widespread occurrence and diverse clinical manifestations. The objective of the guidelines panel was to provide evidence-based guidance on the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of urinary tract infections (UTIs) and male accessory-gland infections, while addressing crucial public health aspects related to infection control and antimicrobial stewardship.

Methods

For the 2024 guidelines on urological infections, new and relevant evidence was identified, collated, and appraised via a structured assessment of the literature. Databases searched included Medline, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Libraries. Recommendations within the guidelines were developed by the panel to prioritise clinically important care decisions. The strength of each recommendation was determined according to a balance between desirable and undesirable consequences of alternative management strategies, the quality of the evidence (including the certainty of estimates), and the nature and variability of patient values and preferences.

Key Findings and Limitations

Key recommendations emphasise the importance of a thorough medical history and physical examination for patients with urological infections. The guidelines stress the role of antimicrobial stewardship to combat the rising threat of antimicrobial resistance, providing recommendations for antibiotic selection, dosing, and duration on the basis of the latest evidence.

Conclusions and Clinical Implications

This overview of the 2024 EAU guidelines offers valuable insights into managing urological infections and are designed for effective integration into clinical practice.

Patient Summary

The European Association of Urology has issued an updated guideline on urological infections. The guidelines provide recommendations for diagnosis, treatment, and prevention, with a particular focus on minimising antibiotic use because of the increasing global threat of antimicrobial resistance.

### Complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI): clinical guidelines for treatment and management [^117Smpys]. IDSA (2025). High credibility.

Complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI) antibiotic duration — In patients presenting with complicated UTI (including acute pyelonephritis) and who are improving clinically on effective therapy, we suggest treating with a shorter course of antimicrobials, using either 5–7 days of a fluoroquinolone (conditional recommendation, moderate certainty of evidence) or 7 days of a non-fluoroquinolone antibiotic (conditional recommendation, very low certainty of evidence), rather than a longer course (10–14 days). An effective antimicrobial agent achieves therapeutic levels in the urine and relevant tissue and is active against the causative pathogen. The duration of therapy is counted from the first day of effective antibiotic therapy. Most studies supporting this recommendation excluded patients with indwelling urinary catheters, severe sepsis, immunocompromising conditions, abscesses in the urinary tract, chronic kidney disease, bacterial prostatitis, complete urinary obstruction, or undergoing urologic surgical procedures. Some patients in these subpopulations may be at higher risk for complications or treatment failure and may need an individualized duration of therapy. Men with febrile UTI in whom acute bacterial prostatitis is suspected may benefit from a longer treatment duration (i.e., 10–14 days), although evidence to guide the optimal duration in this subgroup is lacking. Consider evaluation for an ongoing nidus of infection requiring source control in patients who do not have prompt clinical improvement.

3 Results

3.1 UTI Diagnosis and Patient Characteristics

During the study period, a total of 494,675 episodes were recorded as lower UTI in 300,354 patients registered in 390 general practices (mean 1.7 infections per person). Eighty-three per cent of episodes were in women (Table 1). Median age at diagnosis was 54 years (IQR 31–73). The highest frequency of UTIs occurred in women aged 18–64 years (46.5%) and the lowest amongst children of < 3 months of age (9.1%). The overall mean annual number of UTI episodes per person was 1 (SD = 0.40). The percentage of adults with only 1 UTI episode per year ranged from 79.2% in women aged ≥ 65 years to 91.0% in men aged 18–64 years (Fig. 1). The percentage of adults with ≥ 3 episodes per year (recurrent UTI) ranged from 1.0% in men aged 18–64 years to 2.6% in women aged ≥ 65 years.

Fig. 1
Distribution of patients by the annual number of lower urinary tract infection episodes in adult women and men, Jan 2011–Dec 2015.

An antibiotic prescription for any indication in the previous year was recorded for 66.7% of patients with UTIs. The median time since last prescribed antibiotic was 3.9 months (IQR 1.3–10.4), ranging from 0.6 for children of < 3 months to 6.2 months for those aged 4–15 years. A penicillin (6% co-amoxiclav, 0.5% pivmecillinam, and 29.4% other penicillin), trimethoprim (26.2%) and nitrofurantoin (15.1%) were those most often prescribed. The most common comorbidities present at the time of UTI diagnosis were asthma (15.7%) and cardiovascular diseases (13.5%). Chronic kidney disease was also common in the eldest age group (26.1% of episodes with stage 3 renal disease). A urine sample for microscopy or culture was requested within 10 days for 25.0% of episodes (range between 9.1% in children of < 3 months and 30.6% in 18- to 64-year-old men; Table 2).

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of asymptomatic bacteriuria: 2019 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^111gDBjm]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). High credibility.

Antimicrobial stewardship considerations in asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) emphasize limiting unnecessary cultures and therapy; a positive urine culture often encourages antimicrobial use, and obtaining urine cultures when not clinically indicated promotes inappropriate antimicrobial use. Given the potential negative societal consequence of antimicrobial resistance, screening for bacteriuria and treatment of ASB should be discouraged unless there is evidence to support a benefit of treatment for a given population. Randomized studies across multiple groups found no benefit of antimicrobial treatment, while antimicrobials increased risks including antimicrobial resistance, Clostridioides difficile infection, and in some cases increased urinary tract infection shortly after therapy.

### Urinary tract infection: clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and management of the initial UTI in febrile infants and children 2 to 24 months [^112KQckX]. Pediatrics (2011). Medium credibility.

Antimicrobial therapy duration for febrile UTI — the total course of therapy should be 7 to 14 days, and there is evidence that 1- to 3-day courses for febrile UTIs are inferior to courses in the recommended range; therefore, the minimal duration selected should be 7 days. Outcomes of short courses (1–3 d) are inferior to those of 7- to 14-d courses, and there are minimal harm and minor cost effects of antimicrobial choice and duration of therapy. Aggregate quality of evidence: A/B (RCTs), intentional vagueness notes that no evidence distinguishes the benefit of treating 7 vs 10 vs 14 days, and the policy level is Strong recommendation/ recommendation.

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of asymptomatic bacteriuria: 2019 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^1137PKjR]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). High credibility.

Endourologic procedures and asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) — For endoscopic urologic procedures associated with mucosal trauma, we recommend screening for and treating ASB prior to surgery (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). We suggest obtaining a urine culture prior to the procedure and prescribing targeted antimicrobial therapy rather than empiric therapy (weak recommendation, low-quality evidence). In patients with ASB who will undergo a urologic procedure, we suggest a short course (1 or 2 doses) rather than more prolonged antimicrobial therapy (weak recommendation, low-quality evidence), and antimicrobial therapy should be initiated 30–60 minutes before the procedure.

### Procalcitonin and pyuria-based algorithm reduces antibiotic use in urinary tract infections: a randomized controlled trial [^1155AHnb]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Patients with complicated febrile UTI were older and had multiple comorbidities. Especially in this population with the highest disease burden, in whom the longest antibiotic therapy is recommended by current guidelines, our algorithm proved to be effective.

The safety subgroups were small, but no trend for difference in rates of persistent infection was shown at 7 days after end of therapy or at 30 days after enrollment. The slightly higher, but non-significant, rate of bacteriuria and asymptomatic infection in the PCT-pyuria group should not be viewed as an unsuccessful treatment. There is vast evidence that asymptomatic bacteriuria should not be treated. In fact, asymptomatic bacteriuria might be protective against future development of pyelonephritis, as elegantly shown in a prospective Italian study of young women with asymptomatic bacteriuria, who benefited from symptomatic treatment versus antibiotics. There is evidence that in older patients with isolated non-specific signs or non-infectious symptoms, such as delirium, urine testing and subsequent antibiotic therapy should not be ordered.

Furthermore, the follow-up mid-stream urine cultures in the PCT-pyuria group yielded in the majority of cases Enterococcus faecalis (Table 2), which has recently been shown to have a low positive predictive value for uropathogen growth in the bladder.

The antibiotics chosen in our algorithm, derived from international guidelines, should not deter from the necessity to adapt antibiotic choices to local epidemiology and resistance data. In Switzerland, 18.5% of Escherichia coli were resistant to fluoroquinolones in 2013, compared to 22.3% in the European Union in 2012.

A major strength was the innovative study design with antibiotic guidance based on the combination of the systemic and local response against a control group receiving antibiotic therapy according to the low end of currently recommended guidelines.

Potential limitations

Our study has the following limitations. First, the small sample size due to slow recruitment and the heterogeneity of patients within the predefined subgroups limit the power of the analysis, especially regarding safety outcomes. Second, the follow-up mode by telephone interview and by urine samples which were returned by mail harbors potential recall bias and underreporting, which we tried to counteract by contacting the primary care physician and by obtaining discharge letters of subsequent hospitalizations. Third, the analysis of the recurrence rate in the subgroup of patients with bacteremia was limited due to the small numbers. Further studies will have to clarify whether this algorithm needs to be adapted for patients with bacteremia.

### Urinary tract infection in children [^115NfmKY]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2010). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Up to 11.3% of girls and 3.6% of boys will have had a urinary tract infection (UTI) by the age of 16 years, and recurrence of infection is common. Vesicoureteric reflux is identified in up to 40% of children being investigated for a first UTI, and is a risk factor for, but weak predictor of, renal parenchymal defects.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of treatment of acute urinary tract infection in children? What are the effects of interventions to prevent recurrence? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to July 2009 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 25 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: antibiotics (short initial intravenous antibiotics, long initial intravenous antibiotics, initial oral antibiotics, single-dose or single-day courses of oral antibiotics, short courses of oral antibiotics, long courses of oral antibiotics, immediate empirical antibiotics, delayed antibiotics, prolonged delay of antibiotics, prophylactic antibiotics); immunotherapy; surgical correction of minor functional abnormalities; and surgical correction of moderate to severe vesicoureteric reflux.

### Effect of 7 vs 14 days of antibiotic therapy on resolution of symptoms among afebrile men with urinary tract infection: a randomized clinical trial [^1171F9GK]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Determination of optimal treatment durations for common infectious diseases is an important strategy to preserve antibiotic effectiveness.

Objective

To determine whether 7 days of treatment is noninferior to 14 days when using ciprofloxacin or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole to treat urinary tract infection (UTI) in afebrile men.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled noninferiority trial of afebrile men with presumed symptomatic UTI treated with ciprofloxacin or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole at 2 US Veterans Affairs medical centers (enrollment, April 2014 through December 2019; final follow-up, January 28, 2020). Of 1058 eligible men, 272 were randomized.

Interventions

Participants continued the antibiotic prescribed by their treating clinician for 7 days of treatment and were randomized to receive continued antibiotic therapy (n = 136) or placebo (n = 136) for days 8 to 14 of treatment.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The prespecified primary outcome was resolution of UTI symptoms by 14 days after completion of active antibiotic treatment. A noninferiority margin of 10% was selected. The as-treated population (participants who took ≥ 26 of 28 doses and missed no more than 2 consecutive doses) was used for the primary analysis, and a secondary analysis included all patients as randomized, regardless of treatment adherence. Secondary outcomes included recurrence of UTI symptoms and/or adverse events within 28 days of stopping study medication.

Results

Among 272 patients (median [interquartile range] age, 69 [62–73] years) who were randomized, 100% completed the trial and 254 (93.4%) were included in the primary as-treated analysis. Symptom resolution occurred in 122/131 (93.1%) participants in the 7-day group vs 111/123 (90.2%) in the 14-day group (difference, 2.9% [1-sided 97.5% CI, -5.2% to ∞]), meeting the noninferiority criterion. In the secondary as-randomized analysis, symptom resolution occurred in 125/136 (91.9%) participants in the 7-day group vs 123/136 (90.4%) in the 14-day group (difference, 1.5% [1-sided 97.5% CI, -5.8% to ∞]) Recurrence of UTI symptoms occurred in 13/131 (9.9%) participants in the 7-day group vs 15/123 (12.9%) in the 14-day group (difference, -3.0% [95% CI, -10.8% to 6.2%]; P = 0.70). Adverse events occurred in 28/136 (20.6%) participants in the 7-day group vs 33/136 (24.3%) in the 14-day group.

Conclusions and Relevance

Among afebrile men with suspected UTI, treatment with ciprofloxacin or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole for 7 days was noninferior to 14 days of treatment with regard to resolution of UTI symptoms by 14 days after antibiotic therapy. The findings support the use of a 7-day course of ciprofloxacin or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole as an alternative to a 14-day course for treatment of afebrile men with UTI.
