## Question

what is CAD blood pressure goal for a 77year old male

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the optimal blood pressure target for a 77-year-old man with coronary artery disease. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the patient's risk profile and how age modifies targets. Then, I should verify what major guidelines recommend for CAD and for older adults. Next, I will examine the J-curve evidence and SPRINT subgroup data to avoid over-aggressive lowering. After that, I should integrate frailty, comorbidities, and measurement context. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, safety-conscious target and monitoring plan with drug-class choices and shared decision-making considerations.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and risk framing. A 77-year-old with established CAD is high risk for recurrent events, and age itself shifts the balance of benefits and harms for intensive BP lowering. Importantly, meta-analytic data suggest older patients may derive relatively greater absolute benefit from lower SBP targets, but this must be weighed against hypotension, falls, and coronary hypoperfusion risks in diastole-sensitive patients [^111N6w76] [^114uhsuM].

> Next, I should review authoritative guideline targets. The 2023 AHA/ACC chronic coronary disease guideline recommends a BP target of less than 130/80 mmHg to reduce cardiovascular events and mortality in adults with CAD and hypertension, aligning with the broader ACC/AHA hypertension approach for high-risk secondary prevention populations [^115otGXW] [^114FJRAe]. Hold on, I should verify the European perspective; the 2023 ESH guidance advises treating most older adults to less than 140/80 mmHg first, then considering less than 130/80 mmHg if well tolerated, which introduces a stepwise, tolerance-based strategy rather than a single fixed target in the elderly [^111yiHyr]. I need to ensure I also recall the 2018 ESC/ESH position, which explicitly supports less than 130/80 mmHg in CAD but cautions against going below 120/80 mmHg, reinforcing a lower boundary for safety [^1134RRzq].

> I will now examine the J-curve concern, especially for diastolic pressure in CAD. Multiple large cohorts and trials show increased events when SBP drops below about 120 mmHg and when DBP falls below about 70 mmHg, likely reflecting impaired coronary perfusion during diastole. CLARIFY demonstrated higher risk with SBP less than 120 mmHg and DBP less than 70 mmHg, and TNT identified a nadir around 146/81 mmHg, underscoring that "lower is better" is not universally true in CAD [^1158mSg6] [^113dXZnm]. Wait, let me verify whether revascularization modifies this. Post hoc SPRINT analyses in CAD suggest attenuated composite outcome benefits and a possible increase in stroke with intensive SBP targets, particularly among those with prior revascularization, reinforcing caution with overly aggressive lowering in this subgroup [^112BLqK7] [^112h8X43].

> But wait, what about SPRINT in older adults without diabetes? The SPRINT subgroup aged 75 and older showed fewer cardiovascular events and lower all-cause mortality with an SBP target less than 120 mmHg, yet that population excluded diabetes and prior stroke and was not CAD-specific; benefits cannot be directly extrapolated to a 77-year-old with established CAD without considering diastolic perfusion and revascularization status, so I should not jump to an SBP less than 120 mmHg recommendation here [^114uhsuM] [^111PHE9U].

> Let me consider age-specific nuances. For adults 65–79, ESH 2023 prioritizes achieving less than 140/80 mmHg first, then, if tolerated, moving toward less than 130/80 mmHg. This staged approach balances efficacy and safety in older patients who may have wider pulse pressures and autonomic changes that increase hypotension risk [^111yiHyr]. I should double-check the very old threshold; ESC/ESH 2018 suggested higher initiation thresholds in patients 80 years and older, but for a 77-year-old, the 65–79 framework applies, allowing a pragmatic step-down if BP is already controlled and well tolerated [^111TiDc3].

> Next, I should review comorbidity modifiers. Diabetes with CAD complicates the picture. INVEST suggested that "tight" SBP control to less than 130 mmHg did not improve outcomes versus 130–139 mmHg and was associated with higher mortality on extended follow-up, so I need to be cautious about pushing below 130 mmHg in diabetic CAD unless there is a compelling, individualized rationale and close monitoring for harm [^116sDKku]. Hold on, I should verify whether frailty, CKD, or cognitive impairment are present. In older adults with limited life expectancy, institutionalization, or moderate-to-severe frailty, guidelines endorse relaxing targets to "as low as reasonably achievable", emphasizing comfort, function, and fall risk mitigation over aggressive numbers [^113a1pp9].

> I need to ensure the measurement context is correct. Unattended automated office BP, home BP monitoring, and ambulatory BP each influence target interpretation; both ACC/AHA and ESH emphasize standardized measurements and preferential use of out-of-office BP to guide therapy, which can reduce white-coat effects and better align treatment with true cardiovascular risk in older adults [^1111Jbtd] [^116qTNbx]. Let me reconsider whether variability matters; higher visit-to-visit SBP variability in INVEST was associated with increased long-term mortality in CAD, so stabilizing BP with consistent regimens and follow-up cadence is prudent in this 77-year-old [^112XXvVP] [^113iYQbb].

> Now, I will synthesize a practical target. A reasonable, evidence-aligned goal is to achieve less than 130/80 mmHg if tolerated, while avoiding SBP less than 120 mmHg and DBP less than 70 mmHg due to J-curve risks; if there are symptoms of hypotension, syncope, dizziness, or ischemia, or if DBP drifts into the 60s, I should accept a slightly higher target such as 130–139/80–85 mmHg and prioritize symptom control and safety [^115otGXW] [^1158mSg6]. Wait, I initially thought to propose a hard floor of 130/80 mmHg for everyone with CAD, but I should correct that; ESC/ESH 2018 explicitly cautions against going below 120/80 mmHg in CAD, and ESH 2023 allows a stepwise approach with less than 140/80 mmHg first, so a rigid less than 130/80 mmHg mandate is too inflexible for some older adults [^1134RRzq] [^111yiHyr].

> For drug selection, I should confirm compelling indications in CAD. Beta-blockers and renin–angiotensin system blockade are foundational post–myocardial infarction or with angina, with calcium channel blockers, thiazide-like diuretics, and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists added as needed to reach the target while monitoring for orthostasis, bradycardia, and electrolyte disturbances. This aligns with contemporary AHA/ACC and ESH guidance for secondary prevention in chronic coronary disease [^111yyMDk] [^113rpZLc]. Hold on, I should verify heart rate targets; in symptomatic CAD, ESH suggests aiming for a resting heart rate around 60–80 bpm when feasible with beta-blockers or non-dihydropyridine CCBs, which can complement BP control and reduce myocardial oxygen demand [^1147STc9].

> I should double-check the monitoring cadence and safety labs. Given the higher risk of hypotension, AKI, and electrolyte abnormalities with intensive therapy in older adults, I would reassess BP, symptoms, creatinine/eGFR, and potassium within 1–2 weeks after initiating or intensifying therapy, then every 3–6 months once stable. Home BP logs and medication reconciliation at each visit help reduce variability and adverse events [^notfound]. If the patient is on diuretics, RAAS inhibitors, or MRAs, I need to ensure labs are checked after dose changes to preempt hyperkalemia or renal dysfunction, especially in those with CKD or interacting drugs [^notfound].

> Finally, I need to ensure shared decision-making incorporates preferences and function. I will discuss the potential benefits of achieving less than 130/80 mmHg versus the risks of hypotension, falls, and coronary hypoperfusion, and I will set a stop criteria for DBP less than 70 mmHg or SBP less than 120 mmHg. If the patient values symptom avoidance and independence over marginal event reduction, a target of 130–139/80–85 mmHg may be the better clinical choice, with periodic attempts to lower further only if well tolerated [^1134RRzq] [^111yiHyr]. Let me verify alignment with revascularization status. If the patient had prior PCI or CABG, I should be particularly cautious with intensive SBP targets given the SPRINT subgroup signal for increased stroke, reinforcing a moderated, individualized approach rather than aggressive downward titration [^112BLqK7] [^112h8X43].

> Bottom line, after weighing guidelines, J-curve data, and age-specific considerations, my final recommendation is to target less than 130/80 mmHg if tolerated, avoid SBP less than 120 mmHg and DBP less than 70 mmHg, and accept 130–139/80–85 mmHg if there are symptoms, frailty, or intolerance. This balances the cardiovascular benefits of lower BP with the coronary perfusion and safety needs of a 77-year-old with CAD, and it remains consistent with contemporary ACC/AHA and ESH guidance for high-risk older adults [^115otGXW] [^111yiHyr] [^1158mSg6].

---

For a 77-year-old male with CAD, the recommended blood pressure goal is **< 130/80 mmHg** [^115otGXW] if tolerated, with a **minimum diastolic threshold of 70 mmHg** to avoid coronary hypoperfusion [^1134RRzq] [^1158mSg6]. If intensive therapy causes hypotension, syncope, or renal dysfunction, consider a **more conservative target of 130–139/80–85 mmHg** [^111yiHyr] [^1142VtCM]. Always individualize to frailty, comorbidities, and tolerance, and monitor closely for adverse effects [^113a1pp9].

---

## Recommended blood pressure targets

Current guidelines recommend a **BP target of < 130/80 mmHg** for patients with CAD, including older adults, if tolerated [^115otGXW] [^111r5kMU]. This target balances cardiovascular risk reduction with the potential risks of intensive BP lowering in older patients [^1142VtCM].

---

## Evidence supporting the < 130/80 mmHg target

Multiple randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses demonstrate that achieving **BP < 130/80 mmHg** significantly reduces cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction, stroke, and heart failure, in patients with CAD [^115otGXW] [^116LCFBb]. The SPRINT trial, which included older adults, demonstrated significant reductions in cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality with intensive BP control [^114uhsuM].

---

## Risks associated with intensive blood pressure lowering in elderly patients

While intensive BP control offers significant benefits, it also poses risks in elderly patients, including:

- **Hypotension**: Increased risk of dizziness, syncope, and falls [^1142VtCM].
- **Renal dysfunction**: Higher incidence of acute kidney injury and electrolyte abnormalities [^114uhsuM].
- **Coronary hypoperfusion**: Excessive BP lowering, particularly diastolic pressure, may compromise coronary perfusion and exacerbate ischemia [^1158mSg6].

---

## Individualized approach to blood pressure management

Given these risks, **BP management in elderly patients with CAD should be individualized**, considering:

- **Frailty and functional status**: Frail patients may not tolerate intensive BP targets and may require more conservative goals [^113a1pp9].
- **Comorbidities**: Presence of diabetes, chronic kidney disease, or peripheral vascular disease may necessitate adjusted targets [^1142VtCM].
- **Patient preferences and quality of life**: Shared decision-making is essential to align treatment goals with patient preferences and quality of life [^116vSRYY].

---

## Alternative blood pressure targets

If the patient experiences adverse effects or cannot tolerate the intensive target, a **more conservative BP target of 130–139/80–85 mmHg** is reasonable [^111yiHyr]. This range still provides cardiovascular benefit while minimizing the risks associated with intensive BP lowering [^1142VtCM].

---

## Clinical monitoring and adjustment

Regular monitoring of BP, renal function, electrolytes, and symptoms is essential. Adjust therapy based on **patient response, tolerance, and clinical judgment** [^113a1pp9].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended bp target** |
|-|-|
| General target for elderly CAD patients | < 130/80 mmHg (if tolerated) |
| Conservative target for frail or intolerant patients | 130–139/80–85 mmHg |
| Minimum diastolic threshold | ≥ 70 mmHg |

---

The recommended blood pressure goal for a 77-year-old male with CAD is **< 130/80 mmHg** if tolerated, with a **minimum diastolic threshold of 70 mmHg**. If adverse effects occur, a more conservative target of 130–139/80–85 mmHg is reasonable. Individualize treatment based on frailty, comorbidities, and patient preferences, with close monitoring for adverse effects.

### Cardiac event rate in a lifestyle modification program for patients with chronic coronary artery disease [^113xsi8U]. Clinical Cardiology (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Several clinical trials have shown that intensive lifestyle modification programs have a significant impact on cardiovascular risk factors.

Hypothesis

This paper is a retrospective analysis to determine the effect of participation in a 2-year lifestyle management program on long-term clinical outcome in patients outside the setting of a clinical trial.

Methods

Patients with angiographically confirmed coronary artery disease (CAD) enrolled in a 2-year program of exercise training, dietary counseling, stress management, and therapeutic education. They were accepted into the program from 1991 through December 2002. Follow-up after completion of the program ranged from 10 to 2 years.

Results

In all, 134 patients enrolled in the program; of these, 77 completed the program and 57 failed to do so. Those who completed the program improved their effort tolerance and reached recommended goals for serum lipid and blood pressure levels. The cumulative event rate (cardiac death, myocardial infarction, and stroke) over 10 years in the patients who completed the program was 1.5%. The corresponding event rate in patients who dropped out was 18% (p < 0.02).

Conclusions

It is suggested that patients who complete a 2-year lifestyle modification program appear to have a favorable prognosis over an extended period of time.

### The impact of left ventricular mass on diastolic blood pressure targets for patients with coronary artery disease [^115PPw1m]. American Journal of Hypertension (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Defining the optimal diastolic blood pressure (DBP) for patients with hypertension and coronary artery disease (CAD) is an ongoing challenge in part because of the concern that low DBP may have adverse cardiac effects (the J curve hypothesis).

Methods

Left ventricular mass (LV mass) was measured on the echocardiogram of individuals (N = 92) with CAD who had coronary blood flow (CBF) in the left anterior descending (LAD) artery estimated from artery diameter and DBP distal to coronary stenosis.

Results

CBF approached 0 in a small but defined proportion of persons at DBP of 70mm Hg. CBF was significantly lower in persons with higher LV mass (above the median of 83g/m(2)) when DBP was ≥ 75mm Hg. Higher electrocardiogram QRS voltage (sum of S V1 and R in V6), in the absence of LV hypertrophy (LVH), identified persons with significantly lower CBF at DBP ≥ 80mm Hg. In multivariate analysis, LV mass was a significant CBF determinant after adjusting for DBP and CAD severity. LV mass has a major impact on CBF when DBP is > 70mm Hg, while DBP is the primary determinant of CBF when DBP is ≤ 70mm Hg. Multivariate analysis confirmed a significant interaction between LV mass and DBP.

Conclusions

DBP ≤ 70mm Hg is associated with a progressively greater proportion in whom CBF in the LAD approaches 0. For DBP > 70mm Hg, persons with higher LV mass, even in the absence of LVH, have lower CBF, suggesting LV mass is an important consideration when DBP is reduced in patients with CAD.

### Hypertension pharmacological treatment in adults: a World Health Organization guideline executive summary [^1142VtCM]. Hypertension (2022). Medium credibility.

In the GDG recommended guidelines (Figure 3), the evidence base for recommendation on target BP consisted of systematic reviews as well as a review of relevant trials. – In patients with comorbidity (CAD, DM, CKD), there is consistent benefit with lower targets (variable thresholds); however, data in these subgroups were imprecise and the evidence was less certain. Therefore, the GDG cautions against applying this evidence to lower-risk patients with raised BP or hypertension. Adverse events such as dizziness in intensive control group and ischemia in patients with coronary artery disease can shift the balance of benefits and harms in older individuals (those aged 65 years or older). Concern about lower adherence due to the need for extra patient and provider effort to reach lower targets should also be balanced against intensive control. The overall certainty of the evidence was judged to be moderate, with large benefits and moderate harms. The GDG made a judgement that the desirable effects outweigh the undesirable effects at a treatment goal of < 140/90 mm Hg in all patients with hypertension without comorbidities and SBP < 130 mm Hg in high-risk patients with hypertension — those with high CVD risk, diabetes, and CKD. More evidence is required about treatment of those in the SBP 130 to 139 range who fall into one or more of the following subgroups: diabetes, CKD, heart failure, 65 years or older.

CVD risk assessment strategy for those without existing CVD can be based on age, sex, body mass index, BP, previous antihypertensive treatment, smoking, diabetes, and history of CVD.

Most patients with an average SBP ≥ 140 or DBP ≥ 90 mm Hg are at high risk for CVD and initiation of antihypertensive drug therapy is indicated. Although helpful, cardiovascular (CVD) risk assessment is not mandatory before initiating antihypertensive drug treatment. CVD risk assessment is most important for guiding decisions about initiating pharmacological treatment for hypertension in those with a lower average SBP (130–139 mm Hg). In all adults with hypertension, it is important that other risk factors for CVD be identified and treated appropriately to lower total cardiovascular risk. Many CVD risk-assessment instruments are available. In the absence of a calibrated equation for the local population, the choice should depend on the resources available, and the acceptability and feasibility of the available CVD risk predicting tools. Whenever CVD risk assessment may impede the timely initiation of hypertension treatment and/or patient follow-up, it should be postponed and included as a follow-up strategy.

### Implications of new hypertension guidelines in the United States [^111rdtVJ]. Hypertension (2012). Low credibility.

The American Heart Association released a scientific statement based on available clinical trials and expert opinion in 2007 for the treatment of hypertension to prevent coronary artery disease. These guidelines recommend more aggressive control of blood pressure (BP < 130/80 mm Hg) among those at high risk for coronary artery disease, individuals with diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, coronary artery disease or coronary artery disease risk equivalent, or a 10-year Framingham risk score ≥ 10%. Based on newer clinical trial data, the 2011 American College of Cardiology Foundation/American Heart Association (AHA) hypertension guidelines for the elderly recommend a less aggressive approach of < 145/90 mm Hg in those over the age of 80 years. We estimated the burden of uncontrolled BP among those at an increased risk of coronary artery disease using the both the 2007 AHA and the 2011 American College of Cardiology Foundation/AHA hypertension guidelines. We used a cross-sectional analysis of National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2005–2008 participants. Participants were 10198 adults aged 18 to 85 years. Using the 2011 American College of Cardiology Foundation/AHA hypertension guidelines (≥ 140/90 mm Hg), 72 million Americans (35%) have hypertension. Using the 2007 AHA guidelines, an additional 7 million American adults (5%) have elevated BP requiring treatment, for a total of 79 million adults (40%). Although individuals at a higher risk for coronary artery disease are more likely to be aware of their hypertension and to be taking antihypertension medication, they are less likely to have their BP under control. Additional efforts are needed in the treatment of elevated BP, especially among individuals with an increased risk of coronary artery disease.

Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

Blood pressure target evidence and implementation — clinical trials support intensive systolic blood pressure (SBP) goals, with attention to adverse effects and measurement standards. The evidence to support an SBP goal < 130 mm Hg is strong, and there is also evidence for an SBP goal < 120 mm Hg versus < 140 mm Hg, though based on fewer trials; overall, clinical trials provide strong support for an SBP goal < 130 mm Hg and, when feasible, SBP < 120 mm Hg. Adverse effects such as hypotension, syncope, injurious falls, electrolyte abnormalities, and reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) are usually mild and infrequent. Achievement of target blood pressure (BP) should be based on an average of ≥ 2 readings at ≥ 2 visits, not on a single measurement. For adults not at high risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD), an SBP/diastolic blood pressure (DBP) target of < 130/80 mm Hg seems reasonable, and shared decision-making should be used when life expectancy is limited or the patient is institutionalized due to frailty or comorbidity.

### Intensive blood pressure treatment in coronary artery disease: implications from the systolic blood pressure intervention trial (SPRINT) [^11319sc4]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2022). Medium credibility.

Results

Study cohort and population characteristics

Of the 9361 participants in the SPRINT study, there were 1206 participants with CAD (of whom 692 underwent coronary revascularization) and 8127 participants without CAD at baseline (Supplementary Fig. 1). There were significant differences in baseline characteristics between participants with and without CAD (Supplementary Table 1). The baseline characteristics of participants with and without coronary revascularization are shown in Supplementary Table 2.

The baseline characteristics of participants with CAD were comparable (P > 0.05) between the standard and intensive groups (Table 1). At baseline, the mean BP was 136.9 ± 16.2/73.6 ± 12.0 mm Hg in the standard group and 138.6 ± 15.5/74.7 ± 12.1 mm Hg in the intensive group. In both groups, the mean BP levels were controlled to within the target range (133.7 ± 3.0/71.0 ± 1.4 mm Hg vs. 120.9 ± 2.5/64.6 ± 1.6 mm Hg) during follow-up. The mean number of BP-lowering medications in the standard and intensive groups was 2.1 and 3.0, respectively (Fig. 1). The BP-lowering medications of different groups are summarized in Supplementary Tables 3 and 4.

### Impact of the 2014 expert panel recommendations for management of high blood pressure on contemporary cardiovascular practice: insights from the NCDR PINNACLE registry [^115EviqL]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Since 2003, the Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee (JNC-7) has been the predominant guideline for blood pressure management. A 2014 expert panel recommended increasing the blood pressure targets for patients age 60 years and older, as well as those with diabetes or chronic kidney disease.

Objectives

The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of the 2014 expert panel blood pressure management recommendations on patients managed in U.S. ambulatory cardiovascular practices.

Methods

Using the National Cardiovascular Data Registry PINNACLE Registry, we assessed the proportion of patients who met the 2003 and 2014 panel recommendations, highlighting the populations of patients for whom the blood pressure goals changed.

Results

Of 1,185,253 patients in the study cohort, 706,859 (59.6%) achieved the 2003 JNC-7 goals. Using the 2014 recommendations, 880,378 (74.3%) patients were at goal. Among the 173,519 (14.6%) for whom goal achievement changed, 40,323 (23.2%) had a prior stroke or transient ischemic attack, and 112,174 (64.6%) had coronary artery disease. In addition, the average Framingham risk score in this group was 8.5 ± 3.2%, and the 10-year ASCVD risk score was 28.0 ± 19.5%.

Conclusions

Among U.S. ambulatory cardiology patients with hypertension, nearly 1 in 7 who did not meet JNC-7 recommendations would now meet the 2014 treatment goals. If the new recommendations are implemented in clinical practice, blood pressure target achievement and cardiovascular events will need careful monitoring, because many patients for whom the target blood pressure is now more permissive are at high cardiovascular risk.

### Association of 1-year blood pressure variability with long-term mortality among adults with coronary artery disease: a post hoc analysis of a randomized clinical trial [^112XXvVP]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Until the late 1990s, variability in BP was considered a random phenomenon that needed to be overcome to determine the "true BP", especially in clinical trials. INVEST used a computer-based algorithm with an important "validation logic" built in to identify and exclude nonphysiological or highly variable BP responses. Despite the exclusion of extreme BP variability, we observed that visit-to-visit SBP variability was associated with long-term mortality up to almost 13 years after the assessment of SBP variability. These data are consistent with reports that visit-to-visit variability in BP is not a merely random phenomenon and has important prognostic implications in some other cohorts.

Prior studies document an association of higher BP variability with CVD, stroke, left ventricular remodeling, and death. However, most of these studies have focused on relatively short-term outcomes, populations without a prior history of CAD, and relatively younger populations. Those studies also had relatively fewer patients and shorter follow-up durations, and many were observational cohorts without a standardized BP measurement. Also, owing to wide heterogeneity of prior studies, the number of BP visits, the time between visits, and the cohort size, conflicting results emerged regarding the associations between BP variability and adverse outcomes. Our study attempted to address some of the limitations of the prior studies by evaluating the long-term mortality of a large, older, high-risk population (16 688 patients; mean [SD] age, 66.5 [9.9] years) with a similar representation of men and women. Our population was well characterized, with protocolized BP measurements. Furthermore, the mortality signal with SBP variability was consistent even after adjustment for multiple baseline covariates. This association, as in prior BP variability studies, was probably not associated with poor BP control because approximately 72% of INVEST patients achieved goal BP levels by the end of trial follow-up.

Regarding specific circumstances for hypertension, more specifically with respect to patients with coronary artery disease, AAPA/ABC/ACC/ACPM/AGS/AHA/APhA/ASH/ASPC/NMA/PCNA 2018 guidelines recommend to aim for a BP target of < 130/80 mmHg in adult patients with stable ischemic heart disease and HTN.

### The J-curve between blood pressure and coronary artery disease or essential hypertension: exactly how essential? [^116QBvT6]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2009). Low credibility.

The topic of the J-curve relationship between blood pressure and coronary artery disease (CAD) has been the subject of much controversy for the past decades. An inverse relationship between diastolic pressure and adverse cardiac ischemic events (i.e., the lower the diastolic pressure the greater the risk of coronary heart disease and adverse outcomes) has been observed in numerous studies. This effect is even more pronounced in patients with underlying CAD. Indeed, a J-shaped relationship between diastolic pressure and coronary events was documented in treated patients with CAD in most large trials that scrutinized this relationship. In contrast to any other vascular bed, the coronary circulation receives its perfusion mostly during diastole; hence, an excessive decrease in diastolic pressure can significantly hamper perfusion. This adverse effect of too low a diastolic pressure on coronary heart disease leaves the practicing physician with the disturbing possibility that, in patients at risk, lowering blood pressure to levels that prevent stroke or renal disease might actually precipitate myocardial ischemia. However, these concerns should not deter physicians from pursuing a more aggressive control of hypertension, because currently blood pressure is brought to recommended target levels in only approximately one-third of patients.

### Intensive blood pressure treatment in coronary artery disease: implications from the systolic blood pressure intervention trial (SPRINT) [^1112KQD8]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Our results indicate that CAD and coronary revascularization status influence the effect of BP treatment on clinical outcomes. Intensive BP treatment decreased the risk of major cardiovascular events in participants without CAD, but not in those with CAD. For CAD participants, intensive BP treatment is associated with a reduced risk for all-cause death but does not affect other clinical outcomes, compared with standard BP treatment. The cardiovascular benefits from intensive BP treatment were further attenuated and the risk of stroke might increase in patients with CAD and a history of coronary revascularization.

The results of this study add to the complex evidence for the interaction and association of BP control with CAD status and coronary revascularization. We found a lower risk of clinical outcomes with an SBP target of 120 mm Hg among hypertensive patients without CAD. Attar et al. performed a further analysis of SPRINT participants categorized based on the baseline 10-year Framingham risk, and their results indicated that intensive BP treatment is beneficial for primary prevention of CVD and mortality in patients with high risk (above 10%). In contrast, another clinical trial (ONgoing Telmisartan Alone and in combination with Ramipril Global Endpoint Trial, ONTARGET) found that reducing SBP below 130 mm Hg failed to reduce cardiovascular mortality and that the optimal SBP was 135–145 mm Hg in patients with high cardiovascular risk.

### Blood pressure targets in patients with coronary artery disease: observations from traditional and Bayesian random effects meta-analysis of randomised trials [^116LCFBb]. Heart (2013). Low credibility.

Context

Most guidelines for treatment of hypertension including the Joint National Committee-7 recommend a blood pressure (BP) goal of < 140/90 mm Hg for hypertensive patients and a more aggressive goal of < 130/80 mm Hg for patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), based largely on expert consensus.

Objective

To evaluate the BP targets in patients with CAD DATA SOURCES: PUBMED, EMBASE and CENTRAL Study Selection: Randomised clinical trials (RCTs) of antihypertensive therapy in patients with CAD, enrolling at least 100 patients, with achieved systolic pressure of ≤ 135 mm Hg in the 'intensive BP' group and ≤ 140 mm Hg in the 'standard BP' group with follow-up for at least 1 year and evaluating cardiovascular outcomes.

Data Extraction

The following efficacy outcomes were extracted- all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, myocardial infarction, stroke, angina pectoris, heart failure and revascularisation.

Results

We identified 15 RCTs enrolling 66,504 participants with 276,328 patient-years of follow-up. Intensive BP group (≤ 135 mm Hg) was associated with a 15% decrease in heart failure rate and 10% decrease in stroke rate, driven largely by trials with a more intensive BP group (≤ 130 mm Hg), with similar outcomes for death and cardiovascular death and was associated with a 105% increase in the risk of hypotension. More intensive BP group (≤ 130 mm Hg) was also associated with a reduction in myocardial infarction and angina pectoris. The results were similar in a Bayesian random effects model. In addition, lower seemed to be better (based on regression analysis) for the outcomes of myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure and perhaps angina.

Conclusions

The present body of evidence suggests that in patients with CAD, intensive systolic BP control to ≤ 135 mm Hg and possibly to ≤ 130 mm Hg is associated with a modest reduction in stroke and heart failure but at the expense of hypotension. Lower was better, although not consistently so for myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure and perhaps angina. Further trials are needed to prove these findings.

### Harmonization of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association and European Society of Cardiology / European Society of Hypertension blood pressure / hypertension guidelines [^1175p4Lu]. European Heart Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Reflections

Although differences in guidelines are invariably highlighted, it is notable that the core advice in the ACC/AHA and ESC/ESH guidelines is remarkably similar in most important areas of practice (Table 9). Even for the area of greatest difference, the definition of hypertension, there is still considerable overlap. In both guidelines, adults with an average SBP ≥ 140 mm Hg or DBP ≥ 90 mm Hg are designated as having hypertension and treatment with a combination of lifestyle counseling and antihypertensive drug therapy is recommended. Those with an average SBP 130 to 139 mm Hg are designated as having stage 1 hypertension in the ACC/AHA and high normal BP in the ESC/ESH. However, both guidelines recommend lifestyle modification for most adults in this BP category, the addition of antihypertensive drugs only being recommended for the ≈30% of US adults with CVD or a 10-year ASCVD risk ≥ 10% in the ACC/AHA guideline and only to be considered in very-high-risk patients, especially those with coronary artery disease, in the ESC/ESH CPG. For many other treatment differences, the 2 guidelines provide overall advice that is similar but sometimes discrepant in the specifics. For example, both guidelines recommend combination antihypertensive drug therapy but the specific application for this advice is somewhat different. The ESC/ESH places great emphasis on single-pill combination drug therapy, whereas the ACC/AHA encourages single-pill combinations when possible but notes that many of the combination pills available in the United States use hydrochlorothiazide rather than chlorthalidone and often use a diuretic dose that is lower than what has been used in the landmark treatment trials. Likewise, both guidelines recommend a lower BP target during treatment compared with what was advised in previous guidelines, including in older adults. Overall, the difference lies in the ESC/ESH taking a more stepped approach, first recommending achievement of an SBP/DBP < 140/90 mm Hg before targeting a lower BP, if tolerated, and identifying SBP 120 mm Hg and DBP 70 mm Hg as the lower safety boundary for BP reduction in adults 18 to 65 years of age (130 mm Hg in those with CKD). The ACC/AHA recommends a single SBP/DBP target of < 130/80 mm Hg in most adults but SBP < 130 mm Hg in older well adults, if tolerated.

### Hypertension management in emergency departments [^114v3BKG]. American Journal of Hypertension (2020). Medium credibility.

The 2017 ACC/AHA guidelines revising the diagnosis threshold for hypertension and goal BP to 130/80 mm Hg among high-risk patientsadds to the importance of identifying and addressing elevated BP in the ED, particularly for ED patients without access other sources of care. While there is considerable evidence linked to long-term outcomes that guide non-ED assessment and management of nonemergent BP elevations, evidence to inform ED care is still evolving. The 2013 ACEP clinical policy writing group articulated this noting significant gaps in evidence regarding ED hypertension screening, management of nonemergent elevated BP, antihypertensive medication initiation or titration, and timing of follow-up to improve short- and long-term outcomes while minimizing risks of adverse events.

While the ACC/AHA guidelines have traction in the United States, the 2018 European Society of Cardiology (ESC)/European Society of Hypertension (ESH) guidelines have noted differences in defining hypertension and targets for treatment. The ESC/ESH guidelines define hypertension as ≥ 140/90 mm Hg and target treatment based on age and risk. For patients with BP 130–139/85–89 mm Hg, ESC/ESH guidelines recommend lifestyle change and consideration of drug treatment, particularly if patients have high cardiovascular risk. For patients ≤ 80 years who have BP ≥ 140/90 mm Hg, drug treatment is indicated. For patients > 80 years, ESC/ESH guidelines recommend drug treatment for SBP ≥ 160 mm Hg. If patients tolerate treatment to maintain BP < 140/90 mm Hg, further lowering targets a DBP < 80 mm Hg and SBP based on age (SBP target 120–129 mm Hg if age < 65 years, 130–139 mm Hg if 65–79 years, and 130–139 mm Hg as tolerated in those > 80 years). For patients with known coronary artery disease, therapy is targeted to maintain BP < 130/80 mm Hg. Both guidelines have similar recommendations for BP measurement, lifestyle modifications, and recommended medications. Both recommend strong consideration for single-pill combination antihypertensive medications.

### Searching for optimal blood pressure targets in type 2 diabetic patients with coronary artery disease [^1126a167]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Epidemiologic studies have shown that hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are global public health issues and become the major cause of disease burden and mortality. The World Health Organization estimated that 40% of adults worldwide have hypertension (about 90% are classified with essential hypertension), and approximately 422 million adults were living with diabetes(more than 90% are T2DM). In addition, hypertension is present in more than half of type 2 diabetic patients and contributes significantly to macro- and micro-vascular complications. The development of T2DM is often asymptomatic and subclinical for a long period, and before diagnosis of T2DM, individuals can reside in the high-risk state of prediabetes, defined as impaired fasting glucose or impaired glucose tolerance. Recently, the prevalence of hypertension and T2DM is increasing in many Asian countries, with a number of countries with blood pressure (BP) and glucose above the global average. The Chinese National Report of Cardiovascular Disease 2018 pointed out that the prevalence of hypertension and diabetes reaches 23.2% and 10.9%, respectively, leading to an estimate of about 290 million of adult people suffering from cardiovascular disease in China. The major goal for cardiovascular care is to prevent morbidity and mortality by controlling glucose, normalizing BP, and reducing other cardiovascular risk factors. Data frequently suggest an existence of the relationship between BP and cardiovascular risks as low as 110–115 mmHg for systolic BP and 70–75 mmHg for diastolic BP. Every 20 mmHg systolic and 10 mmHg diastolic BP increase above the threshold has shown to double the risk of mortality from ischemic heart disease and stroke. For decades, clinical practice guidelines vary in determining the optimal BP target in patients with T2DM. Whereas several guidelines recommend a BP goal of < 140/90 mmHg, some recommend a lower target of systolic and diastolic BP in certain diabetic population. The newly released American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) Guideline for the Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Management of High BP in adults supports a more aggressive diagnostic and treatment approach, recommending hypertensive patients to maintain their BP < 130/80 mmHg. Although the adoption of new guideline is expected to increase the prevalence of hypertension, endorsing the aggressive approach including lifestyle change and medical treatment would lead to reduced risk of major adverse cardiac events and improvement in overall clinical outcome. However, controversies exist regarding the optimal level of BP attained with therapeutic interventions that is safe and provides cardiovascular protection, especially in patients with T2DM and coexistent coronary artery disease. Furthermore, the class of drugs most appropriate for the treatment of hypertensive diabetics is also unclear and different guidelines emphasize use of different classes for anti-hypertensive treatment in type 2 diabetic patients. Particularly, several new glucose-lowering agents for the treatment of diabetes have been found to lower BP as well, making the interaction between BP and T2DM even more complex. In this review, we will outline the possible optimal BP levels based upon recommendations on the management of hypertension by the current guidelines, in combination with our research findings, for type 2 diabetic patients with coronary artery disease.

### Blood pressure is insufficiently controlled in European patients with established coronary heart disease [^111P24qR]. Journal of Hypertension (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Elevated blood pressure is associated with an impaired prognosis in patients with established coronary heart disease. Adequate blood pressure control is therefore of utmost importance. We report on two successive European surveys that evaluated whether the goals given in recommendations on secondary prevention are achieved.

Methods

The first European Action on Secondary Prevention through Intervention to Reduce Events (EUROASPIRE I) survey was conducted during 1995–1996 in 21 hospitals in nine European countries. The second survey (EUROASPIRE II) was conducted during 1999–2000 in 47 hospitals (including 20 hospitals that participated in EUROASPIRE I) in 15 Europeans countries. Consecutive patients (aged < 71 years) were identified from hospital records after coronary artery bypass grafting, percutaneous coronary intervention, myocardial infarction, or myocardial ischaemia. Patients were invited for an interview and examination at least 6 months after hospitalization. During the interview, blood pressure was measured in a standardized fashion. Systolic blood pressure ≥ 140 mmHg and/or a diastolic blood pressure ≥ 90 mmHg were considered as elevated blood pressure. EUROASPIRE II provides a more comprehensive view on the actual management of patients with established coronary disease. Therefore, we decided to concentrate mainly on the EUROASPIRE II data, and to use EUROASPIRE I for the evaluation of time trends.

Results

In EUROASPIRE II, 5556 patients were interviewed, and 51% were diagnosed with elevated blood pressure. Large regional variations in the prevalence of elevated blood pressure were observed, with values ranging from 37 to 64%. Twenty-five per cent (1401) of patients were on a diet to reduce blood pressure, and among these 61% had elevated blood pressure. The prevalence of elevated blood pressure among the 4827 (87%) patients taking blood pressure-lowering medication (which was not necessarily taken as an antihypertensive treatment) was 51%. Patients with elevated blood pressure were more likely to be diabetic, hypercholesterolemic, and obese than normotensive patients. The proportion of patients who reported being aware of their hypertensive status was somewhat higher in EUROASPIRE II than in EUROASPIRE I (71 versus 67%), and the use of blood pressure-lowering medication was intensified (91 versus 85%). However, these changes were not accompanied by a decrease in the prevalence of elevated blood pressure (54 versus 55% in centres that participated in both surveys).

Conclusion

During 1995–2000 the prevalence of elevated blood pressure in patients with established coronary heart disease remained at an unacceptably high level. Throughout Europe, still about half of coronary patients require more intensive blood pressure management.

### Intensive blood pressure treatment in coronary artery disease: implications from the systolic blood pressure intervention trial (SPRINT) [^111JWPpW]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Large-scale prospective studies have demonstrated that elevated blood pressure (BP) is associated with coronary artery disease (CAD). The prevalence of hypertension ranges from 30 to 70% in individuals with pre-existing CAD, and a previous study demonstrated that a 20 mm Hg rise in systolic blood pressure (SBP) or a 10 mm Hg rise in diastolic blood pressure (DBP) results in a twofold increase in the risk of mortality among patients with ischemic heart disease aged 40–69 years. Meanwhile, a reduction in SBP of 5 mm Hg can decrease the risk of death from cardiovascular disease (CVD) by 9%. Currently, few clinical trials are primarily designed to evaluate optimal BP targets in patients with CAD. Therefore, there are no standardized BP targets for patients with CAD, and current clinical practice is largely based on expert consensus with scant clinical trial evidence. Recent practice guidelines recommend a BP target of less than 130/80 mm Hg in individuals with stable ischemic heart disease (SIHD), although it was acknowledged that this recommendation was supported by limited data. Nevertheless, evidence suggests that adopting a "lower is better" approach for BP is far from ideal and that the BP targets vary depending on patient characteristics.

In hypertensive patients with CAD, atherosclerotic lesions and arterial stiffness tend to be more severe, resulting in a lower DBP and increased pulse pressure. Patients who have undergone coronary revascularization seem to be more tolerant of lower DBP than those who had not, which may be partly explained by improved myocardial perfusion. When performed using the proper revascularization strategy for appropriate patients, coronary revascularization can offer survival benefits in CAD; however, there is a need for further research to define the optimal BP target and therapeutic benefit of intensive BP treatment in this population.

The Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT) examined the effect of intensive BP treatment (SBP target < 120 mm Hg) in hypertensive patients with high cardiovascular risk. Using data from the SPRINT trial, we conducted a post-hoc analysis to investigate the optimal BP in CAD populations and in a subset of CAD patients who had undergone revascularization.

Effects of intensive BP-lowering treatments on all-cause mortality and cardiovascular events

A meta-analysis of four RCTs evaluating intensive versus standard BP lowering in patients with hypertension aged ≥ 75 years demonstrated significant clinical benefits of intensive BP targets. Intensive BP control significantly reduced the risk of composite cardiovascular events (RR: 0.61; 95% CI: 0.40–0.94; P = 0.03), although statistical heterogeneity was substantial (I² = 63%, P = 0.04). All-cause mortality was also significantly lower in the intensive treatment group (RR: 0.72; 95% CI: 0.56–0.93; P = 0.01) with low heterogeneity (I² = 17%, P = 0.30). Similarly, cardiovascular mortality was significantly reduced (RR: 0.55; 95% CI: 0.35–0.88; P = 0.01), with no heterogeneity observed (I² = 0%, P = 0.79). In contrast, the incidence of stroke did not differ significantly between groups (RR: 0.75; 95% CI: 0.48–1.19; P = 0.22), with moderate heterogeneity (I² = 47%, P = 0.15). Importantly, there was no significant increase in serious adverse events associated with intensive BP lowering (RR: 1.00; 95% CI: 0.93–1.08; P = 0.97), and no heterogeneity was observed (I² = 0%, P = 0.54). The results are summarized in Fig. 2, and potential publication bias was assessed using funnel plots presented in Supplementary Fig. 1.

Methods

Data source and study population

Data were collected from the SPRINT study, which is a National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI)-sponsored trial. SPRINT was a randomized, controlled, multicenter open-label trial that evaluated the effects of standard (SBP target < 140 mm Hg) versus intensive (SBP target < 120 mm Hg) BP treatment among 9361 adults with hypertension (SBP of 130–180 mm Hg). Patients with diabetes mellitus, prior stroke, congestive heart failure, and advanced chronic kidney disease were excluded. In this study, patients diagnosed with CAD by a physician were randomized to either a standard or intensive group. Patients were followed up monthly for the first 3 months and every 3 months thereafter until 5 years or closeout. Coronary revascularization was defined by self-report of a history of percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary artery bypass grafting. The detailed inclusion and exclusion criteria are presented in the SPRINT study.

Interventions and measurements

BP measurements were taken with the participants in a seated position using the same automatic device in an unattended office. The mean of three measurements was included in the analysis. During a median follow-up of 3.9 years, BP-lowering medications were adjusted to an SBP target of 135–139 mm Hg in the standard group and to less than 120 mm Hg in the intensive group.

Clinical outcomes and safety events

Composite events of myocardial infarction, acute coronary syndromes, heart failure, stroke, and cardiovascular death were defined as the primary outcomes. Secondary outcomes included all-cause death and the various elements of the composite primary outcome.

In this study, the following conditions were recorded as safety events: hypotension, syncope, electrolyte abnormality, injurious fall, acute kidney injury, and bradycardia. Serious adverse events (SAEs) were defined as fatal events that first caused significant dysfunction and required medical intervention or hospitalization.

Coronary artery disease (CAD) with hypertension — blood pressure (BP) targets and drug selection are specified as follows: a target BP of approximately < 130/80 mmHg in patients with CAD appears safe and can be recommended, but achieving a BP < 120/80 mmHg is not recommended; in patients with CAD receiving BP-lowering drugs, it is recommended to target SBP to < 130 mmHg if tolerated, but not < 120 mmHg, and to target DBP to < 80 mmHg, but not < 70 mmHg; in older patients (aged ≥ 65 years), targeting an SBP range of 130–140 mmHg is recommended; renin–angiotensin system (RAS) blockers are recommended as part of treatment and, in hypertensive patients with CAD, beta-blockers and RAS blockers may improve outcomes post-myocardial infarction; in patients with symptomatic angina, beta-blockers and/or calcium channel blockers (CCBs) are recommended, and beta-blockers and calcium antagonists are the preferred components of the drug treatment strategy.

### Intensive blood pressure treatment in coronary artery disease: implications from the systolic blood pressure intervention trial (SPRINT) [^112BLqK7]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2022). Medium credibility.

To investigate the optimal blood pressure (BP) in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), we conducted subgroup analysis using SPRINT data. The study sample included 1206 participants with CAD (of whom 692 underwent coronary revascularization) and 8127 participants without CAD. Participants were randomized into two groups (systolic BP target of 140 mm Hg vs. 120 mm Hg). The primary outcome was a composite of cardiovascular events. After a median follow-up of 3.9 years, the hazard ratios (HRs) for the primary outcome were 0.65 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.53–0.79) and 1.05 (95% CI 0.76–1.46) among those in the non-CAD and CAD subgroups, respectively (P value for interaction 0.02). Intensive BP treatment was a protective factor for all-cause death (HR 0.60, 95% CI 0.37–0.96) in the CAD subgroup, compared with standard BP treatment. The HRs (95% CI) for stroke were 3.57 (1.17–10.85) and 1.03 (0.29–3.62) among those in the coronary revascularization and non-revascularization subgroups, respectively (P value for interaction 0.13). For safety events, intensive BP treatment increased the risk of hypotension (HR 2.00, 95% CI 1.06–3.79) and electrolyte abnormalities (HR 2.38, 95% CI 1.25–4.56) in the CAD subgroup, while the risk of serious adverse events did not increase (HR 1.03, 95% CI 0.88–1.20). These results suggest that positive benefits from intensive BP treatment might be attenuated in patients with CAD who are under better secondary prevention. The risk of stroke might increase at the systolic BP target of 120 mm Hg in case of coronary revascularization, although the confidence interval was wide.

### Current options in the management of coronary artery disease [^1131ki7M]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2003). Low credibility.

World Health Organization projections suggest that, for the foreseeable future, coronary artery disease (CAD) will remain the largest element of global disease burden, reflecting the aging of the population. Recent American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines estimate that 16.6 million Americans currently have stable angina. Chronic stable angina is associated with significant morbidity and mortality, thus highlighting the need for accurate and early detection and treatment. Clinical examination is the single most important step in evaluating risk. Age, sex, pain type, coexisting diabetes mellitus, hypertension, or known vascular disease are powerful predictors of prognosis and, except for special patient groups, are more reliable than ambulatory electrocardiographic recording, exercise testing, or electron-beam computed tomography. Cost-effective methods for screening the general population for "silent" risk factors predisposing them to atherosclerotic disease in later life are nevertheless required. Aspirin, beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and lipid-lowering agents are currently the backbone of pharmacologic therapy, supplemented by lifestyle changes aimed at promoting exercise, weight reduction, and increased fruit and vegetable intake. However, side effects of chronic drug treatment, especially for those taking multidrug regimens, may affect quality of life and are the principal reason for poor compliance. Coronary bypass surgery and angioplasty are frequently used interventional procedures for CAD, although they can be invasive and costly, and they often need to be repeated. Current options for the management of CAD have their limitations, thus confirming the appropriateness of continuing the search for improved therapies to reverse the disease process and reduce the global burden.

### Baseline predictors of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and systolic blood pressure goal attainment after 1 year in the ISCHEMIA trial [^114s3B8F]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Risk factor control is the cornerstone of managing stable ischemic heart disease but is often not achieved. Predictors of risk factor control in a randomized clinical trial have not been described.

Methods and Results

The ISCHEMIA trial (International Study of Comparative Health Effectiveness with Medical and Invasive Approaches) randomized individuals with at least moderate inducible ischemia and obstructive coronary artery disease to an initial invasive or conservative strategy in addition to optimal medical therapy. The primary aim of this analysis was to determine predictors of meeting trial goals for LDL-C (low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, goal < 70 mg/dL) or systolic blood pressure (SBP, goal < 140 mmHg) at 1 year post-randomization. We included all randomized participants in the ISCHEMIA trial with baseline and 1-year LDL-C and SBP values by January 28, 2019. Among the 3984 ISCHEMIA participants (78% of 5179 randomized) with available data, 35% were at goal for LDL-C, and 65% were at goal for SBP at baseline. At 1 year, the percent at goal increased to 52% for LDL-C and 75% for SBP. Adjusted odds of 1-year LDL-C goal attainment were greater with older age (odds ratio [OR], 1.11 [95% CI, 1.03–1.20] per 10 years), lower baseline LDL-C (OR, 1.19 [95% CI, 1.17–1.22] per 10 mg/dL), high-intensity statin use (OR, 1.30 [95% CI, 1.12–1.51]), nonwhite race (OR, 1.32 [95% CI, 1.07–1.63]), and North American enrollment compared with other regions (OR, 1.32 [95% CI, 1.06–1.66]). Women were less likely than men to achieve 1-year LDL-C goal (OR, 0.68 [95% CI, 0.58–0.80]). Adjusted odds of 1-year SBP goal attainment were greater with lower baseline SBP (OR, 1.27 [95% CI, 1.22–1.33] per 10 mmHg) and with North American enrollment (OR, 1.35 [95% CI, 1.04–1.76]).

Conclusions

In ISCHEMIA, older age, male sex, high-intensity statin use, lower baseline LDL-C, and North American location predicted 1-year LDL-C goal attainment, whereas lower baseline SBP and North American location predicted 1-year SBP goal attainment. Future studies should examine the effects of sex disparities, international practice patterns, and provider behavior on risk factor control.

### 2018 ESC / ESH guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension [^111fKfwn]. European Heart Journal (2018). Medium credibility.

ESC/ESH 2018 hypertension — initiation of treatment according to office blood pressure anchors therapy to hypertension grade, risk, age, and thresholds. Prompt initiation of BP-lowering drug treatment is recommended in patients with grade 2 or 3 hypertension at any level of cardiovascular (CV) risk, simultaneous with the initiation of lifestyle changes. In patients with grade 1 hypertension, lifestyle interventions are recommended to determine if this will normalize blood pressure (BP); in patients with grade 1 hypertension at low–moderate-risk and without evidence of hypertension-mediated organ damage (HMOD), BP-lowering drug treatment is recommended if the patient remains hypertensive after a period of lifestyle intervention; and in patients with grade 1 hypertension and at high risk or with evidence of HMOD, prompt initiation of drug treatment is recommended simultaneously with lifestyle interventions. In fit older patients with hypertension (even if aged > 80 years), BP-lowering drug treatment and lifestyle intervention are recommended when systolic blood pressure (SBP) is ≥ 160 mmHg, while BP-lowering drug treatment and lifestyle intervention are recommended for fit older patients (> 65 years but not > 80 years) when SBP is in the grade 1 range (140–159 mmHg), provided that treatment is well tolerated. Antihypertensive treatment may also be considered in frail older patients if tolerated, and withdrawal of BP-lowering drug treatment on the basis of age, even when patients attain an age of > 80 years, is not recommended, provided that treatment is well tolerated. In patients with high–normal BP (130–139/85–89 mmHg), lifestyle changes are recommended and drug treatment may be considered when their CV risk is very high due to established cardiovascular disease (CVD), especially coronary artery disease (CAD).

Aims

The 2017 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guideline on high blood pressure (BP) lowered the threshold defining hypertension and BP target in high-risk patients to 130/80mmHg. Patients with coronary artery disease and systolic BP 130–139mmHg or diastolic BP 80–89mmHg should now receive medication to achieve this target. We aimed to investigate the relationship between BP and cardiovascular events in 'real-life' patients with coronary artery disease considered as having normal BP until the recent guideline.

Methods and Results

Data from 5956 patients with stable coronary artery disease, no history of hypertension or heart failure, and average BP < 140/90mmHg, enrolled in the CLARIFY registry (November 2009 to June 2010), were analysed. In a multivariable-adjusted Cox proportional hazards model, after a median follow-up of 5.0years, diastolic BP 80–89mmHg, but not systolic BP 130–139mmHg, was associated with increased risk of the primary endpoint, a composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or stroke (hazard ratio 2.15, 95% confidence interval 1.22–3.81 vs. 70–79mmHg and 1.12, 0.64–1.97 vs. 120–129mmHg). No significant increase in risk for the primary endpoint was observed for systolic BP < 120mmHg or diastolic BP < 70mmHg.

Conclusion

In patients with stable coronary artery disease defined as having normal BP according to the 140/90mmHg threshold, diastolic BP 80–89mmHg was associated with increased cardiovascular risk, whereas systolic BP 130–139mmHg was not, supporting the lower diastolic but not the lower systolic BP hypertension-defining threshold and treatment target in coronary artery disease.

### What is new and different in the 2024 European Society of Cardiology guidelines for the management of elevated blood pressure and hypertension? [^113a1pp9]. Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

In 2024, the European Society of Cardiology released a new guideline for the management of elevated blood pressure (BP) and hypertension. The guideline introduced a new BP categorization: (1) nonelevated (office BP < 120/70 mmHg) for which drug treatment is not recommended, (2) elevated (120–139/70–89 mmHg) for which drug treatment is recommended based on cardiovascular disease risk and follow-up BP level, and (3) hypertension (≥ 140/90 mmHg) for which prompt confirmation and drug treatment are recommended in most individuals. The initial default systolic BP treatment target is 120 to 129 mmHg; however, relaxed targets (BP as low as reasonably achievable) are recommended in case of treatment intolerance, adults ≥ 85 years, symptomatic orthostasis, moderate-to-severe frailty, or limited life expectancy. Here, we summarize what is new and different in the 2024 European Society of Cardiology guidelines, relative to other major international hypertension guidelines in Europe and America. Our aim is to reconcile any uncertainty clinicians may have about implementing these various guidelines in patient care.

### Cardiovascular event rates and mortality according to achieved systolic and diastolic blood pressure in patients with stable coronary artery disease: an international cohort study [^1158mSg6]. Lancet (2016). Excellent credibility.

Background

The optimum blood pressure target in hypertension remains debated, especially in coronary artery disease, given concerns for reduced myocardial perfusion if diastolic blood pressure is too low. We aimed to study the association between achieved blood pressure and cardiovascular outcomes in patients with coronary artery disease and hypertension.

Methods

We analysed data from 22672 patients with stable coronary artery disease enrolled (from Nov 26, 2009, to June 30, 2010) in the CLARIFY registry (including patients from 45 countries) and treated for hypertension. Systolic and diastolic blood pressures before each event were averaged and categorised into 10 mm Hg increments. The primary outcome was the composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or stroke. Hazard ratios (HRs) were estimated with multivariable adjusted Cox proportional hazards models, using the 120–129 mm Hg systolic blood pressure and 70–79 mm Hg diastolic blood pressure subgroups as reference.

Findings

After a median follow-up of 5·0 years, increased systolic blood pressure of 140 mm Hg or more and diastolic blood pressure of 80 mm Hg or more were each associated with increased risk of cardiovascular events. Systolic blood pressure of less than 120 mm Hg was also associated with increased risk for the primary outcome (adjusted HR 1·56, 95% CI 1·36–1·81). Likewise, diastolic blood pressure of less than 70 mm Hg was associated with an increase in the primary outcome (adjusted HR 1·41 [1·24–1·61] for diastolic blood pressure of 60–69 mm Hg and 2·01 [1·50–2·70] for diastolic blood pressure of less than 60 mm Hg).

Interpretation

In patients with hypertension and coronary artery disease from routine clinical practice, systolic blood pressure of less than 120 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure of less than 70 mm Hg were each associated with adverse cardiovascular outcomes, including mortality, supporting the existence of a J-curve phenomenon. This finding suggests that caution should be taken in the use of blood pressure-lowering treatment in patients with coronary artery disease.

Subgroup analysis by CAD status

After a median follow-up of 3.9 years (interquartile range 3.4–4.4 years), primary composite events were documented in 150 participants with CAD (70 in the standard group and 80 in the intensive group) (Table 2). Intensive BP treatment was associated with a lower risk of all-cause death (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 0.60, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.37–0.96) and a trend for an increased risk of stroke (adjusted HR 2.08, 95% CI 0.94–4.58), compared with standard BP treatment (Fig. 2 A, B). The primary outcome, as well as most secondary outcomes, were similar in the two groups (Table 2, Fig. 2C). The landmark analysis showed that the HRs for the primary outcome were 1.10 (95% CI 0.79–1.54) and 0.57 (95% CI 0.18–1.79) within and after the first 3.4 years, respectively (Fig. 2D).

### Intensive blood pressure treatment in coronary artery disease: implications from the systolic blood pressure intervention trial (SPRINT) [^112h8X43]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2022). Medium credibility.

The SPRINT study showed that intensive BP treatment resulted in a low rate of major cardiovascular events, but we found no benefits on the primary outcome in participants with pre-existing CAD. Therefore, we further conducted subgroup analysis to verify whether CAD status plays a key role in the effects of BP treatment on clinical outcomes (Fig. 3). The results showed that the HRs for the primary outcome were 0.65 (95% CI 0.53–0.79) and 1.05 (95% CI 0.76–1.46) among those in the non-CAD and CAD subgroup, respectively (P value for interaction 0.02). For participants without CAD, intensive BP treatment significantly decreased the risk of myocardial infarction, heart failure, CVD death, and all-cause death, compared with standard BP treatment.

Subgroup analysis by coronary revascularization status

In addition, participants with CAD were categorized by coronary revascularization status. The HRs for primary outcome were 1.27 (95% CI 0.82–1.95) and 0.82 (95% CI 0.49–1.37) in CAD participants with and without coronary revascularization, respectively (P value for interaction 0.24). Intensive BP treatment appeared to reduce the risk of all-cause death (HR 0.47, 95% CI 0.22–1.01) in participants without coronary revascularization, and there was no increase in the risk of stroke (HR 1.03, 95% CI 0.29–3.62). However, in the subgroup of participants with coronary revascularization, intensive BP treatment had no benefit on all-cause death (HR 0.74, 95% CI 0.40–1.36) but increased the risk of stroke (HR 3.57, 95% CI 1.17–10.85) (Fig. 4).

### Intensive blood pressure treatment in coronary artery disease: implications from the systolic blood pressure intervention trial (SPRINT) [^1177Y1xE]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2022). Medium credibility.

We analyzed the baseline characteristics of participants with and without CAD or coronary revascularization. We observed that traditional cardiovascular risk factors, including heart rate, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and use of aspirin and statins, were better controlled in participants who had CAD or had undergone coronary revascularization than in those who had not. In light of this, we postulate that the benefits of further intensive BP treatment might have been diluted in this population due to existing well-executed secondary prevention. It is, however, undeniable that the relatively limited subject number reduced the power of the study.

Several limitations of the present study should be noted. First, it was based on a post-hoc analysis of data obtained from a randomized controlled trial. The number of participants with CAD was relatively small, which may reduce the power of our statistical analysis. Second, the SPRINT study population excluded patients with a history of diabetes mellitus or stroke; thus, our study conclusions may not apply to other subsets of patients. Third, BP measurements in an unattended office are not an alternative to home BP measurements, given the low correlation and wide range of differences between the two groups. Therefore, these results should be carefully interpreted and further validated through future studies.

In conclusion, the present study suggested that patients without CAD whose SBP is around 120 mm Hg have greater benefits for clinical outcomes, while this benefits might be attenuated in patients with CAD who are under better secondary prevention. The risk of stroke was increased by intensive BP treatment in patients with a history of coronary revascularization, though the confidence interval was wide. These findings may serve to inform current clinical practice and future trial design.

Summary

What is known about the topic

The prevalence of hypertension in individuals with pre-existing CAD ranges from 30 to 70%.
Uncontrolled BP increased mortality in patients with CAD.
Recent practice guidelines recommend a BP target of less than 130/80 mm Hg in individuals with SIHD.

What this study adds

The optimal SBP level in hypertensive patients without CAD and diabetes mellitus is around 120 mm Hg.
In non-diabetic hypertensive patients with CAD who are under better secondary prevention, the benefit from intensive BP treatment might be attenuated.
The risk of stroke is increased by an SBP target of 120 mm Hg in patients with a history of coronary revascularization, though the confidence interval was wide.

The optimal BP targets in hypertensive patients with CAD remain controversial as few randomized clinical trials have directly evaluated this important clinical question. There are several existing studies nested with CAD populations, but these did not examine specific SBP targets. The INternational VErapamil SR Trandolapril STudy (INVEST) conducted by Pepine et al. evaluated 22,576 hypertensive CAD patients aged 50 years or older and found the verapamil-trandolapril-based strategy was as clinically effective as the atenolol-hydrochlorothiazide-based strategy, suggesting that reducing SBP is a far more important clinical consideration than the choice of antihypertensive drug class. A post-hoc analysis of INVEST evaluated 8354 participants ≥ 60 years of age with hypertension and CAD and concluded that these patients may benefit from reducing their SBP below 140 mm Hg. Similar patterns were also observed in the PRavastatin Or atorVastatin Evaluation and Infection Therapy-Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction (PROVE IT-TIMI) 22 trial, which found that the lowest event rates were associated with an SBP range of 130–140 mm Hg in patients with acute coronary syndrome. The Comparison of Amlodipine vs Enalapril to Limit Occurrences of Thrombosis study conducted by Nissen et al. included 1991 CAD patients with an average baseline BP of 129/78 mm Hg and demonstrated that treatment with amlodipine resulted in reduced adverse cardiovascular events in normotensive patients with CAD. The above studies suggest that the optimal SBP level in patients with CAD is clearly lower than 140 mm Hg and perhaps in 120 mm Hg range. According to the recent findings of a network meta-analysis, the 2017 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association practice guideline updated its recommendation for an SBP target to < 130 mm Hg in adults with SIHD.

Conclusions

In conclusion, our study illustrates that implementation of the 2017 ACC/AHA hypertension guideline results in a substantially increased number of adults referred to cardiology practices meeting criteria for hypertension, particularly among young patients with low cardiovascular risk and without history of diabetes, CKD, and CAD. The increase in number of individuals likely to be recommended antihypertensive therapy from the outset will be smaller, as pharmacological treatment is reserved for those with higher ASCVD risk. Moreover, based on this cross‐sectional analysis predating the 2017 ACC/AHA guideline, a substantially higher proportion of adults are at risk of being short of the more intensive BP goal set by the 2017 guideline. This was most pronounced in women, underrepresented races and ethnicities, and those with higher ASCVD risk. Outreach efforts should be targeted at the practice level, given the significant practice‐level variation observed in the proportion of patients meeting BP targets.

CVD Risk Assessment

CVD risk assessment identifies individuals at increased risk for the major complications of hypertension, including target organ damage and death. Both guidelines recommend CVD risk assessment as a complement to the level of BP for antihypertensive treatment decisions, with the ESC/ESH guideline also emphasizing the importance of CVD risk prediction for consideration of concomitant interventions such as statin and antiplatelet therapies. The 2 guidelines differ in their methods for estimation of risk, and as outlined later, their use of the risk information in decision-making for antihypertensive drug treatment. The ACC/AHA prescribes a relatively simple approach in which the presence of CVD automatically indicates high risk (Table 5). In the absence of CVD, ASCVD risk in adults 40 to 79 years of age is estimated using the ACC/AHA Pooled Cohort Equations, which have been validated in White and Black US adults. The ACC/AHA ASCVD Risk Estimator Plusis based on age; levels of SBP, DBP; total, high-density, and low-density cholesterol; history of DM; current smoking; and treatment with antihypertensive drug therapy, statins, or aspirin. The ACC/AHA Guideline Writing Committee estimated a 10-year ASCVD risk of ≈10% in the landmark event–based antihypertensive drug treatment trials, leading to the choice of a higher and lower 10-year ASCVD risk of ≥ 10% and < 10%, respectively. Hypertension in adults with DM, CKD, or age of ≥ 65 years is accepted as a surrogate disease marker for higher ASCVD risk. For adults < 40 years of age, the ACC/AHA recommends estimation of lifetime CVD risk. The ESC/ESH uses 4 categories of CVD risk (Figure 1). Adults with existing CVD, including asymptomatic atheromatous disease on imaging, type 1 or 2 DM, very high levels of individual CVD risk factors, or CKD are considered to be at high or very high risk (10-year CVD mortality of 5%–10% and ≥ 10%, respectively). For all others, 10-year CVD mortality risk should be estimated using the Systematic Coronary Risk Evaluation (SCORE) risk estimator. The SCORE risk is estimated using a patient's age, sex, total cholesterol or total and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, smoking status, and level of SBP. Although not included in SCORE, the ESC/ESH guidelines recommend that heart rate should also be recorded during BP measurements (Table 1–3) and a resting heart rate > 80 beats/min should be considered as a cardiovascular risk factor. Validated SCORE risk charts are available for both high-risk and low-risk European countries and 15 national or regional SCORE risk charts are also available. The ESC/ESH places emphasis on the importance of considering HMOD in the assessment of CVD risk. Comorbidities such as CKD, left ventricular hypertrophy, and DM are included in the SCORE risk assessment tool (Table 5). The guideline also includes a table of SCORE risk calculation correction factors according to ethnicity. Last, the ESC/ESH guideline uses a classification system based on levels of BP, categories of HMOD, other CVD risk factors, and/or CVD, to illustrate the amplification of risk when risk factors aggregate. Both the ESC/ESH and ACC/AHA guidelines recognize challenges with the use and interpretation of CVD/ASCVD risk-estimating tools.

### Comparison of usefulness of secondary prevention of coronary disease in patients [^114KqGCQ]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2013). Low credibility.

The population older than 80 years is increasing but data on prevention of coronary disease in this age group are sparse. The present study compared the improvement in quality of life, lipid profile, blood pressure, weight, and physical performance after cardiac rehabilitation in patients < 80 versus ≥ 80 years of age. A total of 1,112 patients, of whom 79 were older than 80 years, entered a 36-session outpatient cardiac rehabilitation program after interventions for coronary heart disease. The program consisted of physical exercise, lifestyle modification, and pharmacotherapy. Quality of life improved by 1.3 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.6 to 2.0) in octogenarians and 1.8 (95% CI 1.5 to 2.1) in younger patients (p = 0.21), whereas weight decreased by 1.7 lbs (95% CI -2.9 to -0.4) and 3.1 lbs (95% CI -3.6 to -2.5, p = 0.04), respectively. In hypertensive patients, systolic blood pressure decreased from 155 ± 11 to 133 ± 20 mm Hg in octogenarians versus 155 ± 13 to 130 ± 20 mm Hg in younger patients, reducing the prevalence of hypertension to approximately 10% in both groups. Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol decreased by 16 mg/dl (95% CI -27 to -5) versus 19 mg/dl (95% CI -22 to -16), increasing the percentage of patients at recommended goals from 32% to 46% in the elderly (p = 0.04) and from 18% to 30% in younger patients (p < 0.001). Metabolic equivalent levels increased by 1.0 (95% CI 0.7 to 1.3) in octogenarians versus 2.4 (95% CI 2.2 to 2.5) in younger patients (p < 0.001). In conclusion, patients ≥ 80 years of age in an active secondary prevention program derive a significant benefit in well being, risk factors, and exercise capacity and should not be denied such treatment because of age.

Methods

Study design and participants

The prospective, observational, longitudinal registry of patients with stable coronary artery disease (CLARIFY; ISRCTN43070564;) enrolled 32 703 patients from 45 countries between November 2009 and June 2010. Patients were included if they had at least one of the following: documented myocardial infarction ≥ 3 months before enrolment, angiographic demonstration of > 50% coronary stenosis, chest pain with evidence of myocardial ischaemia (at least a stress electrocardiogram or preferably imaging), or coronary artery bypass graft or percutaneous coronary intervention ≥ 3 months before enrolment. Exclusion criteria were hospital admission for cardiovascular reasons in the past 3 months, planned revascularization, or conditions compromising the participation or 5-year follow-up (including severe other cardiovascular disease such as advanced heart failure, severe valve disease, or history of valve repair or replacement). At baseline and at each yearly visit for up to 5 years, symptoms, clinical examination, results of the main clinical and biological tests, treatment, and clinical outcomes were recorded; office BP was measured in seated subjects after a 5-min rest, using the same arm throughout the study, with no pre-specified device. The registry was observational, with no recommendations on clinical management, and therefore, reflects routine practice. Events were accepted as reported by physicians and were not adjudicated. However, all events were source-verified during audits and several measures were implemented to ensure data quality, including onsite monitoring visits of 100% of the data in 5% of centres selected at random; regular telephone contact with investigators to limit missing data and loss to follow-up; and centralized verification of the electronic case report forms for completeness, consistency, and accuracy. The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and local ethical approval was obtained in all countries. All patients gave written informed consent.

This analysis was restricted to patients without any history of hypertension, and with an average systolic and diastolic BP during follow-up below 140 and 90 mmHg, respectively (Supplementary material online, Figure S1). Patients with congestive heart failure (defined as previous hospitalization for heart failure, or symptoms of heart failure, or a left ventricular ejection fraction < 45%) were excluded.

### Moving toward a consensus: comparison of the 2023 ESH and 2017 ACC / AHA hypertension guidelines [^1111Jbtd]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Hypertension is a primary modifiable risk factor for coronary artery disease (CAD), heart failure, stroke, and chronic kidney disease (CKD). The 2017 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) Guidelines for the Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Management of High Blood Pressure in Adults and the recently published 2023 European Society of Hypertension (ESH) guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension are two primary sources on best practices for hypertension diagnosis and treatment. This analysis reviews major updates in the 2023 ESH BP guideline and highlights key similarities and differences with the 2017 ACC/AHA blood pressure (BP) guideline.

Compared to the 2018 European Society of Cardiology/ESH BP guideline, changes in the 2023 ESH guideline were relatively minor. Importantly, the 2023 ESH guideline is more concordant with the 2017 ACC/AHA guideline in several key respects (Figure 1). Both guidelines emphasize the use of standardized measurement protocols to ensure the accuracy of BP measurements. This includes utilizing validated, cuffed devices to obtain office BP measurements across multiple clinic visits. The ESH guideline recommends against the use of cuffless devices, expressing concerns about reliance of cuffless devices on incompletely validated predictive technologies to estimate BP, absence of standardized validation protocols to ensure accuracy of these devices, and need for periodic calibration with cuffed devices. Both guidelines agree that home blood pressure monitoring (HBPM) or ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) should be used prior to diagnosing hypertension since these methods capture the dynamic BP fluctuations that occur during daily life compared to a static snapshot that is obtained by office-based measurements. HBPM uses commercially available validated, cuffed devices to self-monitor BPs at home, while ABPM devices are automated to record BPs at specified timed intervals during a 24- to 48-hour period. Both guidelines highlight the importance of using HBPM and ABPM to detect masked and white-coat hypertension.

### Presence and severity of coronary artery disease in patients who achieved intensive blood pressure reduction at the time of coronary computed tomography angiography [^1166qZWF]. Hypertension Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Blood pressure (BP)-lowering treatment should be aimed at achieving intensive BP control. Coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) has become more widely available and enables the accurate noninvasive assessment of coronary artery stenosis for screening. The presence and severity of coronary artery disease (CAD) in patients who achieved intensive BP control at the time of CCTA were compared to those in patients without hypertension (HTN). Nine hundred eighty-five consecutive subjects who were clinically suspected of having CAD or who had at least one cardiac risk factor underwent CCTA. The patients were divided into four groups: patients without HTN (non-HTN group), hypertensive patients who underwent intensive BP lowering (intensive group, < 130/80mmHg), patients who underwent standard BP lowering (standard group, 130–139/80–89mmHg) and patients with uncontrolled BP (uncontrolled group, > 140/90mmHg). Interestingly, %CAD in the Intensive group was significantly higher than that in patients without HTN. The Intensive group was older and had a higher body mass index, more significantly stenosed coronary vessels, lower levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in the blood, and higher rates of dyslipidemia, diabetes, and anti-dyslipidemia and anti-diabetic medication use than the non-HTN group. The presence of CAD in the Intensive group was independently associated with age, male and smoking, whereas the presence of CAD in the non-HTN group was associated with age, male and family history. Finally, predictors of the number of VDs in the non-HTN and intensive BP-lowering groups were age, male, DL, and intensive BP lowering. In conclusion, these results suggest that hypertensive patients need more rigorous management of other coronary risk factors, despite receiving intensive BP-lowering treatment.

### Intensive blood pressure treatment in coronary artery disease: implications from the systolic blood pressure intervention trial (SPRINT) [^115uwyfH]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2022). Medium credibility.

Because coronary perfusion occurs mainly during diastole, DBP has gradually become the focus of attention in hypertensive patients with CAD. A secondary analysis using data obtained from the INVEST observed a J-shaped association between BP and cardiovascular events, in which the J-curve was relatively more prominent in diastole than in systole. Moreover, the authors found that patients who had coronary revascularization seemed to have the potential to tolerate the lower DBP, compared with those who had not. The current BP management guideline recommends a target DBP of < 80 mm Hg in patients with SIHD. In addition, the PROVE IT-TIMI 22 trial suggested a DBP < 70 mm Hg may be dangerous in patients with high-risk unstable angina. Furthermore, the Treating to New Targets Trial revealed that a low DBP of less than 60–70 mm Hg was accompanied by an increased risk of cardiovascular events in patients with CAD. Similar findings were observed in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study. Therefore, DBP should be considered during hypertension treatment. Unlike the secondary analysis of the previous studies, our results showed that a DBP around 65 mm Hg in patients with CAD was still safe and did not increase CVD events.

In addition, we found that participants with a history of coronary revascularization had lower DBP regardless of antihypertensive treatment, compared to those without such a history. The most probable explanation is that individuals with revascularization have worse atherosclerotic lesions and poorer arterial elasticity. The loss of arterial elasticity results in a decline in DBP and impairment of the auto-regulatory process of coronary circulation. Although revascularization opens culprit vessels and restores blood flow to ischemic areas, such a procedure per se cannot prevent atherosclerotic progression. On the one hand, it is not recommended to achieve an SBP target of 120 mm Hg in CAD patients with coronary revascularization, as our results suggest that this may increase the risk of stroke. On the other hand, excessive diastolic hypotension may have attenuated the benefits from intensive SBP treatment. Further research is required to evaluate the minimum DBP target that has no effect on myocardial perfusion while ensuring adequate reduction in SBP in CAD patients with coronary revascularization.

### Implications of new hypertension guidelines in the United States [^115htGAR]. Hypertension (2011). Low credibility.

The American Heart Association Task Force released a scientific statement in 2007 for the treatment of hypertension in the prevention of coronary artery disease (CAD). These guidelines recommend more aggressive control of blood pressure (BP) among those at high risk for CAD: individuals with diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, cardiovascular disease, congestive heart failure, or a 10-year Framingham risk score ≥ 10%. These individuals are advised to maintain a BP < 130/80 mm Hg. We estimated the burden of uncontrolled BP among those at an increased risk of CAD using the updated task force guidelines. We used a cross-sectional analysis of National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2005–2008 participants. Participants were 24 989 adults aged 18 to 85 years. Using the old definition of hypertension (> 140/90 mm Hg), 98 million (21%) Americans have hypertension. Using the updated guidelines, an additional 52 million (11%) American adults now have elevated BP requiring treatment, for a total of 150 million adults (32%). Adults with diabetes mellitus have the greatest population burden of uncontrolled BP (50.6 million), followed by adults with chronic kidney disease (43.7 million) and cardiovascular disease (43.3 million). Although individuals at a higher risk for CAD are more likely to be aware of their hypertension and to be taking antihypertension medication, they are less likely to have their BP under control. Additional efforts are needed in the treatment of elevated BP, especially among individuals with an increased risk of CAD.

### Does the benefit from treating to lower blood pressure targets vary with age? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^111N6w76]. Journal of Hypertension (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Recommendations differ regarding how blood pressure targets should vary with age. Crucial to this controversy is whether treatment benefit varies with age.

Methods

Systematic searches were conducted for trials randomizing treatment in intensive arms to the recommended SBP targets: 120–140mmHg. Head-to-head meta-analyses and meta-regression were conducted.

Results

Sixteen trials met criteria. Relative to higher targets, lower targets reduced cardiovascular events, but treatment benefit differed significantly among trials due to patient age. Treatment significantly benefited older patients (mean age 77, SD = 72–81), relative risk (RR) = 0.77 (0.61,0.97), P = 0.025, but not younger patients (mean age 61, SD = 53–70), RR = 0.90 (0.78,1.03), P = 0.121, even though the latter had much greater statistical power. The (RR in 80 year olds)/(RR in 55 year olds) = 0.68 (0.47,0.97), P = 0.036. Though statistically nonsignificant, corresponding trends for more specific outcomes favored older patients: Coronary artery disease 0.80, stroke 0.85, heart failure 0.54, and total mortality 0.76. For adverse effects this trend was 0.86 (0.33,2.26). The number needed to treat to lower targets to prevent one cardiovascular event over 10 years in eight populations declined with age by 94%+.

Conclusion

In these novel results, for both RR and absolute risk, treating to SBPs of 120–140mmHg versus higher targets benefited older patients more than younger patients without an age-related increase in the RR for adverse effects. Nonetheless, because all clinical trials excluded the most frail older patients, clinicians must consider individual patient characteristics such as frailty, autonomy, and cognitive ability when choosing blood pressure targets.

### Amlodipine and atorvastatin [^113gtj6w]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (for example, patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal.

Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g., on angina, heart failure, or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy. Amlodipine may be used alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents.

Coronary Artery Disease (CAD)

Chronic Stable Angina

Amlodipine is indicated for the symptomatic treatment of chronic stable angina. Amlodipine may be used alone or in combination with other antianginal agents.

Vasospastic Angina (Prinzmetal's or Variant Angina)

Amlodipine is indicated for the treatment of confirmed or suspected vasospastic angina. Amlodipine may be used as monotherapy or in combination with other antianginal agents.

### AHA / ACC / ASH release guideline on the treatment of hypertension… [^115xwpan]. AAFP (2015). Low credibility.

Key Points for Practice
- A blood pressure target of less than 140/90 mm Hg is recommended in most patients with CAD and hypertension.
- A target of 130/80 mm Hg is reasonable in selected patients with CAD, including those with previous MI, stroke, or CAD risk equivalents.
- Recommended medications for patients with hypertension and chronic stable angina include beta blockers, ACE inhibitors or ARBs, and thiazide or thiazide-like diuretics.
- Medications with evidence that they reduce risks in patients with ACS include beta blockers, ACE inhibitors or ARBs, and possibly aldosterone antagonists. From the AFP Editors The American Heart Association, American College of Cardiology, and American Society of Hypertension have released a guideline on the management of hypertension in patients with coronary artery disease. It updates a previous AHA guideline to reflect newer data.

There is a strong association between hypertension and CAD. This guideline uses the best available evidence to make recommendations about blood pressure reduction and the management of CAD and its varying manifestations. Recommendations BLOOD PRESSURE GOALS In patients with CAD and hypertension, a blood pressure target of less than 140/90 mm Hg is reasonable for the secondary prevention of cardiovascular events. A lower target of 130/80 mm Hg may be acceptable in some of these patients with previous myocardial infarction, stroke, or transient ischemic attack, or CAD risk equivalents. In patients who have CAD with evidence of myocardial ischemia and elevated diastolic blood pressure, blood pressure should be lowered slowly. Clinicians should be cautious when lowering diastolic blood pressure to less than 60 mm Hg in patients with diabetes mellitus or who are older than 60 years.

In older patients with hypertension and wide pulse pressures, lowering systolic blood pressure can lead to very low diastolic blood pressure. If this occurs, the clinician should be prompted to assess for troubling signs or symptoms, especially from myocardial ischemia. A blood pressure target of 140/90 mm Hg is reasonable in hemodynamically stable patients with ACS, and a target of 130/80 mm Hg is appropriate at the time of hospital discharge. Blood pressure should be lowered slowly and without decreasing the diastolic blood pressure to less than 60 mm Hg.

### Potential impact of the 2017 ACC / AHA guideline on high blood pressure in normotensive patients with stable coronary artery disease: insights from the CLARIFY registry [^1133mVhL]. European Heart Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusion

In conclusion, this large international cohort study shows that in normotensive patients with stable coronary artery disease, the cardiovascular risk associated with an average systolic BP of 130–139 mmHg is not higher than that of patients with a systolic BP of 120–129 mmHg, and therefore does not support initiation of BP-lowering therapy in this population. Conversely, patients with diastolic BP between 80 and 89 mmHg (and systolic BP < 140 mmHg) have a significantly increased risk compared with patients with a diastolic BP of 70–79 mmHg, even after multiple adjustments for potential confounders.

### Characteristics of patients with coronary artery disease and hypertension: a report from INVEST [^116QkgbL]. Clinical Cardiology (2001). Low credibility.

In all, 22,599 patients with coexisting hypertension and coronary artery disease (CAD) from around the world are enrolled in the INternational VErapamil SR/trandolapril STudy (INVEST). As a result, much will be learned regarding the use of treatment strategies using verapamil SR and atenolol with and without trandolapril and/or hydrochlororthiazide in patients with hypertension and CAD, all of whom are at high risk for adverse cardiovascular outcomes. This trial will provide meaningful data on optimal treatment strategies for hypertension, especially among patients who are elderly, have diabetes, have left ventricular hypertrophy, or who are dyslipidemic. This trial will be the first to use Joint National Committee on Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC VI) guidelines as blood pressure goals to determine the relative benefits of a calcium antagonist versus a beta-blocker strategy in reducing morbidity and mortality. In addition, women and Hispanic patients participating in INVEST will provide the largest controlled experience in the management of hypertensive patients with CAD, facilitating the development of future guidelines.

### Applying the evidence: do patients with stroke, coronary artery disease, or both achieve similar treatment goals? [^115wuCiK]. Stroke (2009). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

The importance of early and aggressive initiation of secondary prevention strategies for patients with both coronary artery disease (CAD) and cerebrovascular disease (CVD) is emphasized by multiple guidelines. However, limited information is available on cardiovascular protection and stroke prevention in an outpatient setting from community-based populations. We sought to evaluate and compare differences in treatment patterns and the attainment of current guideline-recommended targets in unselected high-risk ambulatory patients with CAD, CVD, or both.

Methods

This multicenter, prospective, cohort study was conducted from December 2001 to December 2004 among ambulatory patients in a primary care setting. The prospective Vascular Protection and Guidelines-Oriented Approach to Lipid-Lowering Registries recruited 4933 outpatients with established CAD, CVD, or both. All patients had a complete fasting lipid profile measured within 6 months before enrollment. The primary outcome measure was the achievement of blood pressure (BP) < 140/90 mm Hg (or < 130/80 mm Hg for patients with diabetes) and LDL cholesterol < 2.5 mmol/L (< 97 mg/dL) according to the Canadian guidelines in place at that time (similar to the National Cholesterol Education Program's value of 100 mg/dL). Secondary outcomes include use of antithrombotic, antihypertensive, and lipid-modifying therapies.

Results

Of the 4933 patients, 3817 (77%) had CAD only; 647 (13%) had CVD only; and 469 (10%) had both CAD and CVD. Mean ± SD age was 67 ± 10 years, and 3466 (71%) were male. Mean systolic and diastolic BPs were 130 ± 16 and 75 ± 9 mm Hg, respectively. Minor but significant differences were observed on baseline BP, total cholesterol, and LDL cholesterol measurements among the 3 groups. Overall, 83% of patients were taking a statin and 93% were receiving antithrombotic therapy (antiplatelet and/or anticoagulant agents). Compared with patients with CAD, those with CVD only were less likely to achieve the recommended BP (45.3% vs 57.3%, respectively; P < 0.001) and lipid (19.4% vs 30.5%, respectively; P < 0.001) targets. Among patients with CVD only, women were less likely to achieve the recommended BP and lipid targets compared with their male counterparts (for LDL cholesterol < 2.5 mmol/L, 18.7% vs 23.8%, respectively; P = 0.048). In multivariable analysis, patients with CVD alone were less likely to achieve treatment success (BP or lipid targets) after adjusting for age, sex, diabetes, and use of pharmacologic therapy.

Conclusions

Despite the proven benefits of available antihypertensive and lipid-lowering therapies, current management of hypertension and dyslipidemia continues to be suboptimal. A considerable proportion of patients failed to achieve guideline-recommended targets, and this apparent treatment gap was more pronounced among patients with CVD and women. Quality improvement strategies should target these patient subgroups.

### A calcium antagonist vs a non-calcium antagonist hypertension treatment strategy for patients with coronary artery disease. the international verapamil-trandolapril study (INVEST): a randomized controlled trial [^114WJmPd]. JAMA (2003). Excellent credibility.

Context

Despite evidence of efficacy of antihypertensive agents in treating hypertensive patients, safety and efficacy of antihypertensive agents for coronary artery disease (CAD) have been discerned only from subgroup analyses in large trials.

Objective

To compare mortality and morbidity outcomes in patients with hypertension and CAD treated with a calcium antagonist strategy (CAS) or a non-calcium antagonist strategy (NCAS).

Design, Setting, and Participants

Randomized, open label, blinded end point study of 22 576 hypertensive CAD patients aged 50 years or older, which was conducted September 1997 to February 2003 at 862 sites in 14 countries.

Interventions

Patients were randomly assigned to either CAS (verapamil sustained release) or NCAS (atenolol). Strategies specified dose and additional drug regimens. Trandolapril and/or hydrochlorothiazide was administered to achieve blood pressure goals according to guidelines from the sixth report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC VI) of less than 140 mm Hg (systolic) and less than 90 mm Hg (diastolic); and less than 130 mm Hg (systolic) and less than 85 mm Hg (diastolic) if diabetes or renal impairment was present. Trandolapril was also recommended for patients with heart failure, diabetes, or renal impairment.

Main Outcome Measures

Primary: first occurrence of death (all cause), nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke; other: cardiovascular death, angina, adverse experiences, hospitalizations, and blood pressure control at 24 months.

Results

At 24 months, in the CAS group, 6391 patients (81.5%) were taking verapamil sustained release; 4934 (62.9%) were taking trandolapril; and 3430 (43.7%) were taking hydrochlorothiazide. In the NCAS group, 6083 patients (77.5%) were taking atenolol; 4733 (60.3%) were taking hydrochlorothiazide; and 4113 (52.4%) were taking trandolapril. After a follow-up of 61 835 patient-years (mean, 2.7 years per patient), 2269 patients had a primary outcome event with no statistically significant difference between treatment strategies (9.93% in CAS and 10.17% in NCAS; relative risk [RR], 0.98; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.90–1.06). Two-year blood pressure control was similar between groups. The JNC VI blood pressure goals were achieved by 65.0% (systolic) and 88.5% (diastolic) of CAS and 64.0% (systolic) and 88.1% (diastolic) of NCAS patients. A total of 71.7% of CAS and 70.7% of NCAS patients achieved a systolic blood pressure of less than 140 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure of less than 90 mm Hg.

Conclusion

The verapamil-trandolapril-based strategy was as clinically effective as the atenolol-hydrochlorothiazide-based strategy in hypertensive CAD patients.

### Moving toward a consensus: comparison of the 2023 ESH and 2017 ACC / AHA hypertension guidelines [^111UNTsb]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

BP grade classifications and definitions did not change between the 2018 European Society of Cardiology/ESH guideline and updated 2023 ESH guideline. As a result, significant differences in BP classification and definition of hypertension between guidelines remain, with ACC/AHA using "stages" and ESH using "grades" for BP categorization (Figure 1). ESH defines hypertension as BP ≥ 140/90 mm Hg, while ACC/AHA uses a threshold of ≥ 130/80 mm Hg. ESH classifies systolic BP between 130 and 139 mm Hg or diastolic ranges between 85 and 89 mm Hg as "high-normal" BP, while ACC/AHA guideline defines this as "stage 1" hypertension.

Recommendations on BP treatment targets also differ. For most patients, the ACC/AHA guideline recommends treating to a BP target of < 130/80 mm Hg. The ESH, on the other hand, recommends tailoring treatment based on age, clinical comorbidities, and patient-specific tolerance. For adults between ages 18 and 64 years, the ESH guideline recommends a BP target < 130/80 mm Hg, similar to what is recommended by the ACC/AHA guideline. However, the ESH guideline recommends higher targets for older patients. For adults aged 65 to 79 years, ESH recommends targeting BP < 140/80 mm Hg, but notes that if tolerated by the patient, a target of < 130/80 mm Hg should be used. The threshold for very old patients (≥ 80 years old) is even higher, targeting SBP between 140 and 150 mmHg. For special populations including hypertensive patients with CKD, the ESH guideline recommends treatment to a higher BP target of < 140/90 mm Hg compared to the recommended ACC/AHA BP target of < 130/80 mm Hg. For other comorbidities including diabetes, CAD, cerebrovascular disease, both guidelines recommend the same BP target of < 130/80 mm Hg. While significant differences still exist between the guidelines, for high-risk patients and individuals between ages 18 and 79 years old, there is consensus to achieve BP goal < 130/80 mm Hg.

### Metabolic control achievement in a population with premature coronary artery disease: results of the genetics of atherosclerotic disease study [^1168ADpb]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

To the best of our knowledge, no studies have investigated the metabolic control of patients with premature coronary artery disease (CAD). The present study analyzes the metabolic control, defined as the simultaneous target in blood pressure, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and hemoglobin A1c, as well as the factors associated with its achievement in patients with premature CAD.

Methods

The study included 1206 patients with CAD diagnosed before the age of 55 and 65years in men and women, respectively. Sociodemographic, clinical and biochemical data were collected to know the prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors, including individual components of metabolic control plus smoking cessation and body mass index (BMI) < 25kg/m 2. Non-strict and strict targets were used to evaluate metabolic control.

Results

Participants were 54 ± 8years old, 19.7% were women and had a median CAD evolution of 2.4years. Non-strict and strict metabolic control was achieved by 18.4% and 6.2% of patients, respectively. Moreover, 79.8% and 67.6% met a composite of three or more cardiovascular risk factor goals using both criteria. BMI < 25kg/m 2 was independently associated with 1.734 (95% confidence interval: 1.207–2.492) and 2.541 (95% confidence interval: 1.608–4.014) higher probabilities to meet non-strict or strict metabolic control.

Conclusion

Our results show that 18.4% and 6.2% of subjects with premature CAD achieved non-strict and strict metabolic control, respectively. BMI < 25kg/m 2 was found to be associated with the achievement of metabolic control. Multidisciplinary strategies including healthy lifestyle changes and pharmacological therapies could decrease the socioeconomic and clinical impact of premature CAD.

Chronic coronary disease — nonpharmacologic blood pressure management details expected systolic blood pressure (SBP) reductions with specific doses. A healthy diet using the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) pattern reduces SBP by −11 mm Hg in hypertension and −3 mm Hg in normotension. Dynamic resistance exercise prescribed as 90–150 min/wk at 50%–80% of 1 repetition maximum with 6 exercises, 3 sets/exercise, 10 repetitions/set lowers SBP by −4 mm Hg in hypertension and −2 mm Hg in normotension. Isometric resistance training using 4×2 min (hand grip) with 1 min rest between exercises at 30%–40% maximum voluntary contraction, 3 sessions/wk for 8–10 wk reduces SBP by −5 mm Hg and −4 mm Hg, respectively. Moderation in alcohol intake for individuals who drink alcohol — Men: ≤ 2 drinks daily; Women: ≤ 1 drink daily — is associated with SBP reductions of −4 mm Hg in hypertension and −3 mm Hg in normotension.

### Amlodipine and atorvastatin [^1171ct9E]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Adjust dosage according to blood pressure goals. In general, wait 7 to 14 days between titration steps. Titration may proceed more rapidly, however, if clinically warranted, provided the patient is assessed frequently.

Angina The recommended dosage of amlodipine for chronic stable or vasospastic angina is 5 to 10 mg, with the lower dose suggested in the elderly and in patients with hepatic insufficiency. Most patients will require 10 mg for adequate effect.

Coronary Artery Disease The recommended dosage range of amlodipine for patients with CAD is 5 to 10 mg once daily. In clinical studies, the majority of patients required 10 mg [see Clinical Studies (14.4)].

Pediatrics The effective antihypertensive oral dose of amlodipine in pediatric patients ages 6 years to 17 years is 2.5 mg to 5 mg once daily. Doses in excess of 5 mg daily have not been studied in pediatric patients [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) and Clinical Studies (14.1)].

Atorvastatin

Assess LDL-C when clinically appropriate, as early as 4 weeks after initiating atorvastatin, and adjust the dosage if necessary.

Recommended Dosage in Adult Patients

The recommended starting dosage of atorvastatin is 10 mg or 20 mg once daily. Patients who require a large reduction in LDL-C (more than 45%) may be started at 40 mg once daily.

### Association of 1-year blood pressure variability with long-term mortality among adults with coronary artery disease: a post hoc analysis of a randomized clinical trial [^115dA3iw]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Discussion

INVEST was the largest randomized clinical trial of older patients with hypertension (approximately one-third > 70 years) with CAD. In this high-risk population, short-term (within the first year after randomization), visit-to-visit SBP variability, but not DBP variability, was associated with long-term mortality. Our findings remained consistent even after adjustment for a robust set of well-measured potential confounders. Compared with the lowest quintiles, the highest quintiles of SBP variability measures were associated with a 14% to 18% increased risk of long-term mortality. Across all 4 BP variability measurements, the signal was significantly stronger among women, a cohort often underenrolled in CVD trials. Our data add to and expand the growing evidence of the prognostic value of visit-to-visit BP variability and its association with poor outcomes for older patients with hypertension and CAD.

### Knowledge of blood pressure levels and targets in patients with coronary artery disease in the USA [^117S1Zgp]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2005). Low credibility.

Little is known about patient awareness of nationally recommended blood pressure targets, especially among patients with cardiac disease. To examine this issue, we interviewed 738 patients hospitalized with coronary artery disease to assess their knowledge of their systolic and diastolic blood pressure levels as well as corresponding national targets. We used bivariate and multivariate analyses to determine if any patient demographic or clinical characteristics were associated with blood pressure knowledge. Only 66.1% of patients could recall their own systolic and diastolic blood pressure levels. Only 48.9% of all patients could correctly name targets for these values. Knowledge of target blood pressure levels was particularly poor among patients who were female (odds ratio (OR) 0.69; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.49–0.98), aged ≥ 60 years (OR 0.70, CI 0.51–0.97), without any college education (OR 0.48, CI 0.35–0.65), without a documented history of hypertension (OR 0.57, CI 0.39–0.84), and with known diabetes (OR 0.46, CI 0.33–0.66). Patients in the highest risk group, according to Joint National Committee guidelines stratification, were no more knowledgeable about their blood pressure levels and targets than lower risk patients. A significant proportion of patients hospitalized with coronary artery disease do not know their own blood pressure levels or targets. Current blood pressure education efforts appear inadequate, particularly for certain patient subgroups in which hypertension is an important modifiable risk factor.

### 2014 eighth Joint National Committee panel recommendation for blood pressure targets revisited: results from the INVEST study [^1179JQZv]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

The 2014 Eighth Joint National Committee panel recommendations for management of high blood pressure (BP) recommend a systolic BP threshold for initiation of drug therapy and a therapeutic target of < 150 mm Hg in those ≥ 60 years of age, a departure from prior recommendations of < 140 mm Hg. However, it is not known whether this is an optimal choice, especially for the large population with coronary artery disease (CAD).

Objectives

This study sought to evaluate optimal BP in patients ≥ 60 years of age.

Methods

Patients 60 years of age or older with CAD and baseline systolic BP > 150 mm Hg randomized to a treatment strategy on the basis of either atenolol/hydrochlorothiazide or verapamil-SR (sustained release)/trandolapril in INVEST (INternational VErapamil SR Trandolapril STudy) were categorized into 3 groups on the basis of achieved on-treatment systolic BP: group 1, < 140 mm Hg; group 2, 140 to < 150 mm Hg; and group 3, ≥ 150 mm Hg. Primary outcome was first occurrence of all-cause death, nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI), or nonfatal stroke. Secondary outcomes were all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, total MI, nonfatal MI, total stroke, nonfatal stroke, heart failure, or revascularization, tabulated separately. Outcomes for each group were compared in unadjusted and multiple propensity score-adjusted models.

Results

Among 8,354 patients included in this analysis with an accumulated 22,308 patient-years of follow-up, 4,787 (57%) achieved systolic BP of < 140 mm Hg (group 1), 1,747 (21%) achieved systolic BP of 140 to < 150 mm Hg (group 2), and 1,820 (22%) achieved systolic BP of ≥ 150 mm Hg (group 3). In unadjusted models, group 1 had the lowest rates of the primary outcome (9.36% vs. 12.71% vs. 21.32%; p < 0.0001), all-cause mortality (7.92% vs. 10.07% vs. 16.81%; p < 0.0001), cardiovascular mortality (3.26% vs. 4.58% vs. 7.80%; p < 0.0001), MI (1.07% vs. 1.03% vs. 2.91%; p < 0.0001), total stroke (1.19% vs. 2.63% vs. 3.85%; p < 0.0001), and nonfatal stroke (0.86% vs 1.89% vs 2.86%; p < 0.0001) compared with groups 2 and 3, respectively. In multiple propensity score-adjusted models, compared with the reference group of < 140 mm Hg (group 1), the risk of cardiovascular mortality (adjusted hazard ratio [HR]: 1.34; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.01 to 1.77; p = 0.04), total stroke (adjusted HR: 1.89; 95% CI: 1.26 to 2.82; p = 0.002) and nonfatal stroke (adjusted HR: 1.70; 95% CI: 1.06 to 2.72; p = 0.03) was increased in the group with BP of 140 to < 150 mm Hg, whereas the risk of primary outcome, all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, total MI, nonfatal MI, total stroke, and nonfatal stroke was increased in the group with BP ≥ 150 mm Hg.

Conclusions

In hypertensive patients with CAD who are ≥ 60 years of age, achieving a BP target of 140 to < 150 mm Hg as recommended by the JNC-8 panel was associated with less benefit than the previously recommended target of < 140 mm Hg.

For 18–65 years, office SBP treatment threshold (mmHg) is ≥ 140 for Hypertension, + Diabetes, + chronic kidney disease (CKD), + coronary artery disease (CAD)†, and + Stroke/transient ischaemic attack (TIA)†, with office DBP treatment threshold (mmHg) ≥ 90. For 65–79 years, thresholds are the same: SBP ≥ 140 across these categories and DBP ≥ 90. For ≥ 80 years, office SBP treatment threshold (mmHg) is ≥ 160 across Hypertension, + Diabetes, + CKD, + CAD, and + Stroke/TIA, with office DBP treatment threshold (mmHg) ≥ 90. The dagger denotes: †Treatment may be considered in these very high-risk patients with high–normal SBP (i.e. SBP 130–140 mmHg).

### Relation between blood pressure and vascular events and mortality in patients with manifest vascular disease: J-curve revisited [^111N3DAR]. Hypertension (2012). Low credibility.

Recent studies have challenged the notion that "lower is better" for blood pressure in relation to vascular events and mortality in patients with vascular disease, whereas practice guidelines currently recommend to lower blood pressure to < 130/80 mm Hg. We reassessed this J-curved relationship between blood pressure and cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality in patients with various manifestations of vascular disease. For this purpose, 5788 patients with symptomatic vascular disease enrolled in the Secondary Manifestations of Arterial Disease Study were followed-up for the occurrence of new vascular events (ie, myocardial infarction, stroke, or vascular death) and all-cause mortality. During a median of 5.0 years (interquartile range: 2.6–8.1 years), 788 patients experienced a new vascular event, and 779 died. Overall, the covariate-adjusted relationship between mean baseline systolic, diastolic, or pulse pressure and the occurrence of vascular events followed a J-curve with increased event rates above and below the nadir blood pressure of 143/82 mm Hg. A similar nonlinear relationship was found for diastolic pressure and all-cause mortality. Elevated blood pressure was not associated with increased morbidity and mortality in patients with recently diagnosed coronary artery disease, ≥ 65 years, and having > 60 mm Hg pulse pressure. Importantly, especially in these subgroups, low blood pressure could also be a symptom rather than a cause of disease. Blood pressure level below and above 143/82 mm Hg is, thus, an independent risk factor for recurrent events in patients with manifest vascular disease. Uncertainty of whether this association is causal provides a strong rationale for trials evaluating blood pressure treatment targets.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2023). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for hypertension, more specifically with respect to patients with coronary artery disease, ACC/ACCP/AHA/ASPC/NLA/PCNA 2023 guidelines recommend to initiate guideline-directed medical therapy with ACEis, ARBs, or β-blockers as first-line therapy for compelling indications (such as recent myocardial infarction or angina) in adult patients with chronic coronary disease and HTN (SBP ≥ 130 mmHg and/or DBP ≥ 80 mmHg), in addition to nonpharmacological strategies. Initiate additional antihypertensive medications (such as dihydropyridine CCBs, long-acting thiazide diuretics, and/or mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists) as needed to optimize BP control.

Blood Pressure

High blood pressure (BP) is an important risk factor for CHD and an even stronger risk factor for stroke. It also is associated with the development of AF, heart failure (HF), left ventricular hypertrophy, renal failure, and dementia. – Results from meta‐analyses with > 61 million adults show that each 20‐mm Hg increase in SBP or 10‐mm Hg increase in diastolic BP doubles the risk of a fatal coronary event.

New BP recommendations (not sponsored by any national organization) were recently published from the group appointed to the Eighth Joint National Committee (JNC 8).

The new recommendations (Figure) are largely similar to the JNC 7 guidelines with 2 important changes. First, they liberalize the systolic treatment goal from < 140 to < 150 mm Hg for patients aged ≥ 60 years; however, the panel did not recommend reducing pharmacological treatment to allow for increased BP in older patients that are tolerant of a SBP < 150 mm Hg. Considerable controversy has followed this change, and a group of committee members on the JNC 8 panel published a dissenting review of the age‐specific SBP treatment goal, citing substantial CV benefit from SBP < 140 mm Hg based on observational data and no new evidence since publication of the JNC 7 guidelines to suggest significant harm from treating to SBP < 140 mm Hg. In addition, BP treatment guidelines from other major international organizations have recommended either a universal treatment goal of < 140 over < 90 mm Hg or a change in the target SBP target to < 150 mm Hg for patients aged ≥ 80 years. – These treatment goals represent reasonable alternatives to the JNC 8 guideline committee recommendations. Currently, a large randomized controlled trial is ongoing and is randomizing > 9000 patients to either standard or intensive BP control and assessing the first occurrence of MI, acute coronary syndrome, stroke, HF, or CVD death.

Clinical Implications and Future Direction

Despite the recommendations of the 2017 ACC/AHA BP guidelines looking at the totality of evidence including the present paper by White et al, it is hard to recommend an across‐the‐board BP goal of < 130/80 mm Hg for all patients with DM and hypertension. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 It seems evident that there is heterogeneity of the effects of intensive BP‐lowering on coronary versus cerebral events, and the effects can also vary based on the presence or absence of comorbid conditions in a given individual (such as those with recent acute coronary syndrome as described in the present study by White et al. 1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 9 The available evidence from RCTs suggest that in patients with preexisting cardiovascular disease, specifically coronary heart disease, it is prudent not to lower SBP ≤ 130 mm Hg; however, for those at higher risk of stroke (such as black and Asian patients) who do not have preexisting coronary heart disease, it may be beneficial to reduce SBP < 120 mm Hg if this can be done without any harm. Overall, it seems reasonable that a BP target of < 140/90 mm Hg as recommended in several recent guidelines will be safe and effective in reducing the risk of coronary events in patients with DM and hypertension. 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10 Lower BP targets might be appropriate in those at higher risk of stroke and other microvascular complications such as chronic kidney disease. As suggested by White et al and in view of the ongoing controversy regarding optimal BP level in high‐risk patients with DM and CAD, prospective RCTs are needed to examine and demonstrate appropriate target BP that can be safely attained and beneficial.

### Metabolic control achievement in a population with premature coronary artery disease: results of the genetics of atherosclerotic disease study [^113oQK2Z]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the leading cause of mortality and disability around the world. and the years of life lost due to premature cardiovascular death have gradually increased since the end of the last century. The American Heart Association (AHA) has established a new concept of cardiovascular health that promotes healthier lifestyles. This concept includes the control of environmental risk factors such as diet, physical activity, smoking cessation and body mass index (BMI), in addition to the control of total cholesterol, blood pressure and fasting plasma glucose, which have been considered as classical clinical risk factors. Improvement of these risk factors helps to reduce the development of incident and recurrent cardiovascular events. Likewise, and based on scientific evidence, several clinical practice guidelines have been developed for the control of cardiovascular risk factors in patients with established CAD; – these recommendations have been updating constantly in the last few years. Although the AHA and the American College of Cardiology (ACC) previously recommended blood pressure < 140/90 mmHg in patients with CAD, they have recently reduced its goal to < 130/80 mmHg. In addition, the AHA/ACC suggests that low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) should be kept less than 70 mg/dL and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C) less than 100 mg/dL to reduce the onset of new and/or recurrent cardiovascular events. On the other hand, in 2017, the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) proposed values of LDL-C < 55 mg/dL and non-HDL-C < 80 mg/dL, in patients with premature CAD considered as subjects with extreme cardiovascular risk. Concerning patients with CAD and diabetes, the American Diabetes Association recommends that hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) should be kept below 8% as a goal to reduce morbidity and mortality in patients with macrovascular complications. According to the AHA/ACC recommendations (non-strict criteria for blood pressure, LDL-C and non-HDL-C), it has been reported that less than half of patients with secondary prevention reached an adequate metabolic control. However, currently, there are no studies that: (a) have used the AACE recommendations (strict criteria for LDL-C and non-HDL-C) and the stringent blood pressure goal (< 130/80 mmHg) to analyze the metabolic control in patients with CAD; (b) have analyzed metabolic control in patients with premature CAD; and (c) have investigated the association of clinical, biochemical and environmental risk factors with metabolic control of premature CAD patients. Hence, the objective of the present study was to analyze the prevalence of non-strict and strict metabolic control (defined as blood pressure, LDL-C, non-HDL-C and HbA1c goals achieved), as well as the independent variables associated with this metabolic control, in patients with premature CAD.

### 2018 ESC / ESH guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension [^111ahHFe]. European Heart Journal (2018). Medium credibility.

ESC/ESH 2018 hypertension — high–normal blood pressure (BP) treatment initiation: The previous (2013) Guidelines recommended not to initiate antihypertensive treatment in people with high–normal BP and low–moderate CV risk, and this is supported by evidence that in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and meta-analyses any reduced outcomes were measured on a background of antihypertensive treatment and therefore do not provide evidence to support treatment initiation in patients without hypertension. The HOPE-3 trial, in which only 22% of the patients at intermediate CV risk had background antihypertensive treatment, showed that BP-lowering treatment did not reduce the risk of major CV events in patients with baseline SBP values in the high–normal range; similarly, a meta-analysis of 13 RCTs or RCT subgroups (involving 21 188 individuals) with untreated baseline high–normal/normal BP showed no effect on major CV events or total mortality. In very high-risk patients with high–normal BP and established cardiovascular disease (CVD), a meta-analysis of 10 RCTs or RCT subgroups [n = 26 883] found that BP-lowering drug treatment, achieving an SBP reduction of 4 mmHg, reduced the risk of stroke but not other CV events, and in trials including people with previous coronary artery disease (CAD) with mean baseline SBP of 138 mmHg, treatment was associated with reduced major CV events (relative risk 0.90; 95% confidence interval 0.84–0.97) without increased survival (relative risk 0.98; 95% confidence interval 0.89–1.07). We recommend that patients with high–normal BP and low–moderate CV risk should be offered lifestyle advice, because this reduces their risk of progressing to established hypertension and may further reduce their CV risk. These patients should not be offered BP-lowering drug treatment.

### Blood pressure and outcomes in very old hypertensive coronary artery disease patients: an INVEST substudy [^111dek6q]. The American Journal of Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Our understanding of the growing population of very old patients (aged ≥ 80 years) with coronary artery disease and hypertension is limited, particularly the relationship between blood pressure and adverse outcomes.

Methods

This was a secondary analysis of the INternational VErapamil SR-Trandolapril STudy (INVEST), which involved 22,576 clinically stable hypertensive coronary artery disease patients aged ≥ 50 years. The patients were grouped by age in 10-year increments (aged ≥ 80, n = 2180; 70- < 80, n = 6126; 60- < 70, n = 7602; < 60, n = 6668). Patients were randomized to either verapamil SR- or atenolol-based treatment strategies, and primary outcome was first occurrence of all-cause death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke.

Results

At baseline, increasing age was associated with higher systolic blood pressure, lower diastolic blood pressure, and wider pulse pressure (P < .001). Treatment decreased systolic, diastolic, and pulse pressure for each age group. However, the very old retained the widest pulse pressure and the highest proportion (23.6%) with primary outcome. The adjusted hazard ratio for primary outcomes showed a J-shaped relationship among each age group with on-treatment systolic and diastolic pressures. The systolic pressure at the hazard ratio nadir increased with increasing age, highest for the very old (140 mm Hg). However, diastolic pressure at the hazard ratio nadir was only somewhat lower for the very old (70 mm Hg). Results were independent of treatment strategy.

Conclusion

Optimal management of hypertension in very old coronary artery disease patients may involve targeting specific systolic and diastolic blood pressures that are higher and somewhat lower, respectively, compared with other age groups.

### Moving toward a consensus: comparison of the 2023 ESH and 2017 ACC / AHA hypertension guidelines [^116qTNbx]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Figure 1
Similarities and Differences Between the 2017 ACC/AHA and 2023 ESH Hypertension Guidelines

ACC/AHA = American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association; BP = blood pressure; CVD = cardiovascular disease; ESH = European Society of Hypertension.

The importance of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk stratification tools in guiding treatment decisions is stressed by both guidelines. The 2023 ESH update emphasizes the use of the updated Systematic Coronary Risk Evaluation 2 (SCORE2) risk prediction model that includes nonfatal ASCVD events and is more aligned with the pooled cohort equation recommended by U.S. guidelines.SCORE2 is derived from large cohort data of healthy Europeans and predicts ASCVD risk for individuals aged 40 to 69 years. The U.S. guideline recommends the use of pooled cohort equation to estimate the 10-year risk of fatal and nonfatal ASCVD events for adults between the ages of 40 and 79 years. The ESH guideline also recommends a separate risk assessment tool, SCORE2-Older Persons (SCORE2-OP) for adults ≥ 70 years, derived from a large, Norwegian cohort. Although these tools can guide treatment decisions, it is important to note that these models were created using derivation cohorts that may not be generalizable to all patients, potentially impacting risk estimates.

### Intensive vs standard blood pressure control and cardiovascular disease outcomes in adults aged ≥ 75 years: a randomized clinical trial [^114uhsuM]. JAMA (2016). Excellent credibility.

Importance

The appropriate treatment target for systolic blood pressure (SBP) in older patients with hypertension remains uncertain.

Objective

To evaluate the effects of intensive (< 120 mm Hg) compared with standard (< 140 mm Hg) SBP targets in persons aged 75 years or older with hypertension but without diabetes.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A multicenter, randomized clinical trial of patients aged 75 years or older who participated in the Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT). Recruitment began on October 20, 2010, and follow-up ended on August 20, 2015.

Interventions

Participants were randomized to an SBP target of less than 120 mm Hg (intensive treatment group, n = 1317) or an SBP target of less than 140 mm Hg (standard treatment group, n = 1319).

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary cardiovascular disease outcome was a composite of nonfatal myocardial infarction, acute coronary syndrome not resulting in a myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, nonfatal acute decompensated heart failure, and death from cardiovascular causes. All-cause mortality was a secondary outcome.

Results

Among 2636 participants (mean age, 79.9 years; 37.9% women), 2510 (95.2%) provided complete follow-up data. At a median follow-up of 3.14 years, there was a significantly lower rate of the primary composite outcome (102 events in the intensive treatment group vs 148 events in the standard treatment group; hazard ratio [HR], 0.66 [95% CI, 0.51–0.85]) and all-cause mortality (73 deaths vs 107 deaths, respectively; HR, 0.67 [95% CI, 0.49–0.91]). The overall rate of serious adverse events was not different between treatment groups (48.4% in the intensive treatment group vs 48.3% in the standard treatment group; HR, 0.99 [95% CI, 0.89–1.11]). Absolute rates of hypotension were 2.4% in the intensive treatment group vs 1.4% in the standard treatment group (HR, 1.71 [95% CI, 0.97–3.09]), 3.0% vs 2.4%, respectively, for syncope (HR, 1.23 [95% CI, 0.76–2.00]), 4.0% vs 2.7% for electrolyte abnormalities (HR, 1.51 [95% CI, 0.99–2.33]), 5.5% vs 4.0% for acute kidney injury (HR, 1.41 [95% CI, 0.98–2.04]), and 4.9% vs 5.5% for injurious falls (HR, 0.91 [95% CI, 0.65–1.29]).

Conclusions and Relevance

Among ambulatory adults aged 75 years or older, treating to an SBP target of less than 120 mm Hg compared with an SBP target of less than 140 mm Hg resulted in significantly lower rates of fatal and nonfatal major cardiovascular events and death from any cause.

### Association of 1-year blood pressure variability with long-term mortality among adults with coronary artery disease: a post hoc analysis of a randomized clinical trial [^114qJoXu]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Conclusions

Visit-to-visit BP variability remains underused in clinical settings. Although antihypertensive medications reduce SBP and DBP, higher short-term BP variability is associated with residual risk for adverse long-term mortality even among patients with controlled BP. Short-term (approximately 1 year) SBP variability measures were associated with mortality more than a decade after measurements in older patients with CAD, even when using variability measures not correlated with mean BP. This association was stronger for women. Next steps should embrace incorporating variability measures in the clinic. Further research should address this excess risk measure with novel therapies or combinations of medications to reduce mortality risk.

### J-curve revisited: an analysis of blood pressure and cardiovascular events in the treating to new targets (TNT) trial [^113dXZnm]. European Heart Journal (2010). Low credibility.

Aim

In patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), a J-curve relationship has been reported between blood pressure (BP) and future cardiovascular events. However, this is controversial. The purpose of the study was to determine the relationship between on-treatment BP and cardiovascular outcomes in patients with CAD.

Methods and Results

We evaluated 10 001 patients with CAD and a low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol level < 130 mg/dL, randomized to atorvastatin 80 vs. 10 mg, enrolled in the TNT trial. The post-baseline, time-dependent BPs [systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP)] were categorized into 10 mmHg increments. The primary outcome was a composite of death from coronary disease, non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI), resuscitated cardiac arrest, and fatal or non-fatal stroke. Among the 10 001 patients, 982 (9.82%) experienced a primary outcome at 4.9 years (median) of follow-up. The relationship between SBP or DBP and primary outcome followed a J-curve with increased event rates above and below the reference BP range, both unadjusted and adjusted (for baseline covariates, treatment effect, and LDL levels). A time-dependent, non-linear, multivariate Cox proportional hazard model identified a nadir of 146.3/81.4 mmHg where the event rate was lowest. A similar non-linear relationship with a higher risk of events at lower pressures was found for most of the secondary outcomes of all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, non-fatal MI, or angina. However, for the outcome of stroke, lower was better for SBP.

Conclusion

In patients with CAD, a low BP (< 110–120/ < 60–70 mmHg) portends an increased risk of future cardiovascular events (except stroke).

Coronary artery disease (CAD) in hypertension — evidence on risk reduction and achieved blood pressure associations shows that for every 10 mmHg reduction in systolic blood pressure (SBP), CAD was reduced by 17%. In treated hypertensive patients with stable CAD, after a median follow-up of 5 years, an SBP of ≥ 140 mmHg and a diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of ≥ 80 mmHg were each associated with increased risk of cardiovascular (CV) events, and an SBP of < 120 mmHg and a DBP of < 70 mmHg were also associated with increased risk of CV events.

### STEP to blood pressure management of elderly hypertension: evidence from Asia [^114RAK31]. Hypertension Research (2022). Medium credibility.

In summary

Finding the best antihypertensive target is quite an important task. In our opinion, lower SBP is better if adverse events can be monitored, avoided, or managed. Certainly, it would be prudent to aim for a more conservative goal in elderly patients who are frail and at risk for falls, or in patients with a DBP of 60–65 mmHg and co-existing coronary artery disease or peripheral artery stenosis. Home BP monitoring is helpful to facilitate hypertension management for older patients. For the elderly hypertensive patients with comorbidities such as prior stroke, diabetes mellitus, heart failure, and renal impairments, or aged over 80 years old, further trials could assess the cardiovascular benefits of intensive BP treatment.

The evidence, from the SPRINT trial, STEP trial, and the individual participant-level meta-analysis in BPLTTC, demonstrates that now is an time to act to return elevated blood pressure to its status as a continuous-variable risk factor, instead of treating it as a dichotomous disease. Blood pressure should be managed as an integrated part of a patient's risk profile.

### 2018 ESC / ESH guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension [^116YKkTY]. European Heart Journal (2018). Medium credibility.

Decision basis for initiating BP-lowering — earlier treatment is supported for patients with systolic blood pressure (SBP) or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) values > 140/90 mmHg when cardiovascular (CV) risk is still low–moderate to prevent the accumulation of hypertension-mediated organ damage (HMOD), and in general the decision to use BP-lowering treatment should not be based solely on CV risk because when baseline BP is below 140/90 mmHg the benefits are at best marginal and most evident in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) at the upper end of the high–normal BP range.

### Association of 1-year blood pressure variability with long-term mortality among adults with coronary artery disease: a post hoc analysis of a randomized clinical trial [^113iYQbb]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Is short-term blood pressure variability from one physician office visit to the next (hereafter referred to as visit-to-visit blood pressure variability) associated with increased long-term mortality risk?

Findings

In this cohort study, 16 688 patients with hypertension who were 50 years of age or older with coronary artery disease were followed up for a mean of 10.9 years. When comparing quintiles of systolic blood pressure variability measures, higher quintiles were associated with long-term mortality even after adjusting for baseline demographic characteristics, mean blood pressure, and comorbidities; the signal was stronger in women compared with men.

Meaning

These findings support efforts to identify and minimize visit-to-visit blood pressure variability to potentially reduce excess mortality later in life.

### Tight blood pressure control and cardiovascular outcomes among hypertensive patients with diabetes and coronary artery disease [^116sDKku]. JAMA (2010). Excellent credibility.

Context

Hypertension guidelines advocate treating systolic blood pressure (BP) to less than 130 mm Hg for patients with diabetes mellitus; however, data are lacking for the growing population who also have coronary artery disease (CAD).

Objective

To determine the association of systolic BP control achieved and adverse cardiovascular outcomes in a cohort of patients with diabetes and CAD.

Design, Setting, and Patients

Observational subgroup analysis of 6400 of the 22,576 participants in the International Verapamil SR-Trandolapril Study (INVEST). For this analysis, participants were at least 50 years old and had diabetes and CAD. Participants were recruited between September 1997 and December 2000 from 862 sites in 14 countries and were followed up through March 2003 with an extended follow-up through August 2008 through the National Death Index for US participants.

Intervention

Patients received first-line treatment of either a calcium antagonist or beta-blocker followed by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, a diuretic, or both to achieve systolic BP of less than 130 and diastolic BP of less than 85 mm Hg. Patients were categorized as having tight control if they could maintain their systolic BP at less than 130 mm Hg; usual control if it ranged from 130 mm Hg to less than 140 mm Hg; and uncontrolled if it was 140 mm Hg or higher.

Main Outcome Measures

Adverse cardiovascular outcomes, including the primary outcomes which was the first occurrence of all-cause death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke.

Results

During 16,893 patient-years of follow-up, 286 patients (12.7%) who maintained tight control, 249 (12.6%) who had usual control, and 431 (19.8%) who had uncontrolled systolic BP experienced a primary outcome event. Patients in the usual-control group had a cardiovascular event rate of 12.6% vs a 19.8% event rate for those in the uncontrolled group (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 1.46; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.25–1.71; P < .001). However, little difference existed between those with usual control and those with tight control. Their respective event rates were 12.6% vs 12.7% (adjusted HR, 1.11; 95% CI, 0.93–1.32; p = 0.24). The all-cause mortality rate was 11.0% in the tight-control group vs 10.2% in the usual-control group (adjusted HR, 1.20; 95% CI, 0.99–1.45; p = 0.06); however, when extended follow-up was included, risk of all-cause mortality was 22.8% in the tight control vs 21.8% in the usual control group (adjusted HR, 1.15; 95% CI, 1.01–1.32; p = 0.04).

Conclusion

Tight control of systolic BP among patients with diabetes and CAD was not associated with improved cardiovascular outcomes compared with usual control.

### Potential impact of the 2017 ACC / AHA guideline on high blood pressure in normotensive patients with stable coronary artery disease: insights from the CLARIFY registry [^116xq8Ld]. European Heart Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Results

A total of 5956 patients with stable coronary artery disease, without any history of hypertension, and with average BP < 140/90 mmHg, were included in the analysis. Baseline characteristics of the patients are given for total population and by average follow-up systolic BP subgroups in Table 1, and by average follow-up diastolic BP subgroups in Table 2. Baseline medications are reported in Supplementary material online, Tables S1 and S2, and the number of patients in each subgroup of systolic BP, cross-classified with subgroups of diastolic BP, is reported in Supplementary material online, Table S3. Mean age at baseline was 61.0 ± 10.8 years, 4973 (83%) were men, and 1031 (17%) had diabetes. Mean average systolic and diastolic BPs were 122.7 ± 12.4 and 74.1 ± 9.8 mmHg, respectively. Compared with patients with systolic BP 130–139 mmHg, those with a lower systolic BP tended to be younger, leaner, less likely to have diabetes, and to have lower total cholesterol and triglyceride levels. Compared with patients with diastolic BP 80–89 mmHg, those with a lower diastolic BP tended to be older, leaner, more likely to be female, to have diabetes, and tended to have lower total cholesterol and triglyceride levels.

After a median follow-up of 5.0 years (IQR 4.2–5.1), 145 patients (2.7%, 95% CI 2.3–3.2) met the primary composite outcome. Cardiovascular death occurred in 114 (2.1%, 95% CI 1.8–2.6) patients, myocardial infarction (fatal or not) in 48 patients (0.9%, 95% CI 0.7–1.2), and stroke (fatal or not) in 29 (0.5%, 95% CI 0.4–0.7) patients.

Regarding medical management for coronary artery disease, more specifically with respect to antihypertensive therapy, ACC/ACCP/AHA/ASPC/NLA/PCNA 2023 guidelines recommend to initiate guideline-directed medical therapy with ACEis, ARBs, or β-blockers as first-line therapy for compelling indications (such as recent myocardial infarction or angina) in adult patients with chronic coronary disease and hypertension (SBP ≥ 130 mmHg and/or DBP ≥ 80 mmHg), in addition to nonpharmacological strategies. Initiate additional antihypertensive medications (such as dihydropyridine CCBs, long-acting thiazide diuretics, and/or mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists) as needed to optimize BP control.
