## Question

Causes of psychogenic seizure

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the causes of psychogenic seizures, also known as psychogenic nonepileptic seizures or functional seizures, and how to frame them in a way that guides diagnosis and management. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about precise definitions and diagnostic foundations to anchor causation claims. Then, I should verify the overarching explanatory framework, especially the biopsychosocial model. Next, I will examine predisposing, precipitating, and perpetuating factors across neurobiological, psychological, and social domains. After that, I need to check for special populations and comorbidities that modify risk. Finally, I will integrate these into a coherent causal model and translate this into practical clinical implications for diagnosis and treatment, while double-checking for pitfalls and exceptions such as coexisting epilepsy and diagnostic delay.

> Let me first confirm the construct and diagnostic foundation so I don't overstate causation without anchoring it to what PNES actually is. PNES are paroxysmal events resembling epileptic seizures but without ictal epileptiform activity on EEG; they are best understood as a functional neurological disorder with genuine symptoms and disability, not feigned, and the diagnosis relies on capturing typical events on video-EEG when available, recognizing that no single semiological sign is pathognomonic and that misdiagnosis is common and costly [^111rRUa8] [^114PkbeP] [^111hNkiH] [^114pJbFL].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about a single cause. I need to ensure I apply the biopsychosocial model that has become the dominant framework for PNES. This model posits that PNES arises from the interaction of predisposing vulnerabilities, precipitating stressors, and perpetuating contextual factors, and it integrates neurobiological susceptibilities with psychological and social determinants rather than privileging any one domain in isolation [^111sHUco] [^1145fNf8] [^117Xda4E].

> I will now examine predisposing factors, but wait, I should verify which are most consistently supported. Neurobiological vulnerabilities include atypical functional connectivity involving emotion–motor–executive networks, and there is a high burden of psychiatric and neurodevelopmental comorbidity, with population data showing substantially elevated risks of prevalent and incident psychiatric disorders in children and adolescents with PNES compared with epilepsy and healthy controls, indicating both temperamental and developmental predispositions [^113cE5vX] [^113b3VnR] [^117Xda4E]. Let me consider trauma next; early life adversity, particularly sexual and physical abuse, is repeatedly associated with PNES, and in trauma-exposed populations such as veterans, PTSD is strikingly overrepresented, reinforcing the link between trauma exposure and dissociative symptom expression [^112LZpZD] [^111TmpGk] [^113jU5gD].

> Next, I should review precipitating factors and make sure I don't conflate correlation with causation. Acute and chronic psychosocial stressors commonly trigger onset, including bereavement, interpersonal conflict, school or occupational stress, and health-related crises. In some cases, the diagnosis of a serious medical illness itself can precipitate PNES, consistent with stress-exceeding-coping models and conversion dynamics under acute threat [^114PkbeP] [^111wb49W]. But wait, what if head injury is involved; I need to check that nuance — while TBI attribution is common in some cohorts, this reflects perceived causation and comorbidity rather than direct epileptogenesis in PNES, so I should frame TBI as a contextual precipitant rather than a primary organic cause of PNES [^111TmpGk] [^113jU5gD].

> I should confirm perpetuating factors because they sustain events and shape prognosis. Lack of social support, avoidance behaviors, isolation, and chronic pain syndromes are frequently reported and likely maintain symptom cycles; importantly, diagnostic delay and unnecessary antiseizure drug exposure can iatrogenically worsen outcomes and healthcare utilization, while comorbid mood, anxiety, and dissociative disorders perpetuate events unless addressed [^117Xda4E] [^114aJrhC] [^116z91qP]. Hmm, wait a minute, I almost implied antiseizure drugs directly worsen PNES physiology; let me correct that — ASDs are ineffective for PNES and may cause adverse effects that complicate presentation, but the harm is primarily iatrogenic and indirect rather than a direct pathophysiological exacerbation of PNES itself [^116z91qP] [^113SpYE2].

> Let me consider special populations and modifiers of risk, and I should double-check the strength of evidence. In pediatrics, incidence has risen over time, psychiatric comorbidity is high, and diagnostic delay is substantial, especially with earlier age of onset and psychological abuse histories; comorbid epilepsy, intellectual disability, and school supports further complicate recognition and prolong time to diagnosis [^115x9m1z] [^115BBDgA] [^113b3VnR]. In adults, female sex predominance and trauma exposure are consistently observed, and in veterans and other trauma-exposed groups, PTSD and mood/anxiety disorders are especially salient, aligning with stress–dissociation models of symptom generation [^114pJbFL] [^111TmpGk] [^113jU5gD].

> I need to ensure I integrate these strands into a coherent causal model. PNES emerges when predisposing neurobiological and psychosocial vulnerabilities intersect with overwhelming stressors that exceed coping capacity, producing dissociative, conversion-type events via dysfunctional network dynamics. Perpetuation occurs through maintained stress, psychiatric comorbidity, avoidance, and healthcare pathways that inadvertently reinforce illness behavior, which explains the heterogeneity of semiology and the frequent comorbidity across functional neurological symptoms [^111sHUco] [^111rRUa8] [^116NX1ay]. Hold on, I should verify that this model aligns with observed clinical variability. Yes, both inter- and intra-individual semiological variability are well documented, consistent with network-level dysfunction and context-dependent expression of symptoms [^113tVYv7].

> Now, translating causation into clinical implications, I should confirm the diagnostic approach. Video-EEG remains the gold standard when feasible, but I must remember that up to a minority of patients ultimately diagnosed with PNES may have coexisting epilepsy, so I should maintain diagnostic humility and, when video-EEG is unavailable, use a clinically established diagnosis based on compatible semiology and supportive features while avoiding overreliance on any single sign [^114PJCAx] [^113bkTUx] [^111hNkiH]. Wait, let me verify supportive markers; serum prolactin can help distinguish generalized tonic–clonic or complex partial seizures from PNES when measured correctly, but it is not useful for all seizure types and must be interpreted in clinical context, and ictal heart rate increases are far more characteristic of epileptic seizures than PNES, which can aid bedside differentiation in select cases [^114wELHm] [^116A5DS7].

> For treatment implications, I should double-check that psychotherapy is first-line and that engagement, not just diagnosis, drives outcomes. Cognitive behavioral therapy and related psychotherapies reduce event frequency and improve functioning, with prospective data linking psychotherapy adherence to clinically meaningful improvements; sertraline may help comorbid symptoms but monotherapy without psychotherapy has not shown robust seizure reduction in controlled trials, so combined approaches are reasonable when psychiatric comorbidity is present [^117AK9TJ] [^112PRkgo] [^117Kh9A8]. I need to ensure I address iatrogenic harm; unnecessary ASDs should be withdrawn when epilepsy is excluded, and benzodiazepines should be minimized given risks of dependence, cognitive effects, and withdrawal phenomena that can mimic or complicate PNES, especially in the absence of an epileptic indication [^112LZpZD] [^112WQrKS].

> But wait, what if the patient presents in crisis with prolonged events? I should confirm acute management principles. Prolonged PNES are common and often misdiagnosed as status epilepticus, leading to unnecessary sedation and intubation; the correct approach is behavioral strategies, reassurance, and de-escalation, reserving medical sedation only for safety or when diagnostic uncertainty persists, and educating emergency teams to obtain ictal video whenever possible to reduce misdiagnosis and harm [^114Y3Xoi] [^111DgGJJ].

> Finally, I should review systems issues that perpetuate poor outcomes and verify where to intervene. Diagnostic delay averages years and is driven by both patient and physician factors, multidisciplinary care improves linkage to mental health and acceptance, and stigma and contested ownership between neurology and psychiatry continue to impede care. Addressing these with coordinated pathways, clear communication, and early psychotherapy engagement is as critical as making the correct diagnosis [^114aJrhC] [^112v6bZB] [^112PehNA].

> In summary, psychogenic seizures arise from the convergence of predisposing vulnerabilities, precipitating stressors, and perpetuating contexts within a biopsychosocial framework. They are real, disabling functional neurological symptoms that require careful differentiation from epilepsy, early psychotherapy-centered treatment, and coordinated multidisciplinary care to alter their course and reduce iatrogenic harm [^111sHUco] [^111rRUa8] [^1118QcoE].

Psychogenic seizures, also known as psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES), are **not caused by abnormal brain electrical activity** but by psychological factors [^115u85xY]. The main causes include **trauma and stress**, psychiatric comorbidities, and maladaptive coping mechanisms [^111sHUco]. Trauma — especially sexual or physical abuse, PTSD, and major life stressors — is strongly linked to PNES [^112LZpZD] [^114PkbeP] [^111TmpGk]. Common psychiatric comorbidities include anxiety, depression, dissociative disorders, and personality disorders, particularly borderline personality disorder [^112LZpZD] [^114pJbFL]. PNES are best understood as a **functional neurological disorder** arising from the interplay of psychological distress, learned behaviors, and social context, rather than deliberate deception or malingering [^113rSTAF] [^117KcB8t].

---

## Psychological trauma and stress

Psychological trauma and stress are among the most consistently identified causes of **psychogenic seizures** [^115gFZyD]. Traumatic experiences — particularly **sexual or physical abuse** — are strongly associated with the development of PNES [^112LZpZD]. PTSD is highly prevalent among individuals with **PNES**, especially in populations exposed to trauma, such as military veterans [^111TmpGk]. Major life stressors — including bereavement, divorce, financial difficulties, or significant life changes — can precipitate or exacerbate PNES episodes [^114PkbeP].

---

## Psychiatric comorbidities

Psychiatric comorbidities are common among individuals with psychogenic seizures and are considered significant contributors to their development and maintenance [^113b3VnR]. These include:

- **Anxiety disorders**: Anxiety disorders, including generalized anxiety disorder and panic disorder, are frequently co-occurring with PNES [^114pJbFL].

- **Depression**: Major depressive disorder is commonly observed in individuals with PNES, often related to chronic stress or trauma exposure [^112LZpZD].

- **Dissociative disorders**: Dissociative disorders, characterized by disruptions in consciousness, memory, identity, or perception, are strongly associated with PNES [^112LZpZD].

- **Personality disorders**: Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is particularly prevalent among individuals with PNES, often linked to emotional dysregulation and interpersonal difficulties [^112LZpZD].

---

## Maladaptive coping mechanisms and learned behaviors

Maladaptive coping mechanisms and learned behaviors play a significant role in the development and maintenance of **psychogenic seizures** [^113cE5vX]. Individuals may develop **PNES** as a learned response to stress or emotional distress, often reinforced by environmental factors such as attention or avoidance of stressful situations [^117Xda4E]. This learned behavior can become automatic and unconscious, distinguishing PNES from deliberate **malingering or factitious disorder** [^117KcB8t].

---

## Neurobiological factors

Recent research suggests that psychogenic seizures may involve **dysfunction in brain networks** related to emotion regulation, stress response, and motor control [^111rRUa8]. Functional neuroimaging studies have identified abnormalities in brain regions such as the anterior cingulate cortex, insula, and prefrontal cortex, which are involved in emotional processing and stress response [^113cE5vX]. These findings support the conceptualization of PNES as a functional neurological disorder with genuine neurological symptoms arising from psychological factors [^113rSTAF].

---

## Social and environmental factors

Social and environmental factors significantly influence the development and maintenance of **psychogenic seizures**. Lack of social support, family dysfunction, and exposure to **chronic stressors** are common in individuals with PNES [^115d5b2r]. Cultural factors, including stigma surrounding mental health and **limited access to mental health care**, may also contribute to the development and persistence of PNES [^116z91qP].

## Summary of causes

| **Category** | **Specific causes** |
|-|-|
| Psychological trauma | - Sexual abuse <br/> - Physical abuse <br/> - PTSD <br/> - Major life stressors |
| Psychiatric comorbidities | - Anxiety disorders <br/> - Depression <br/> - Dissociative disorders <br/> - Personality disorders (e.g. BPD) |
| Maladaptive coping | - Learned behaviors <br/> - Emotional avoidance <br/> - Attention reinforcement |

Psychogenic seizures are complex, multifactorial phenomena arising from the interplay of psychological trauma, psychiatric comorbidities, maladaptive coping mechanisms, neurobiological factors, and social/environmental influences [^111sHUco]. Understanding these underlying causes is essential for effective diagnosis and treatment, emphasizing the need for a **comprehensive, multidisciplinary approach** that addresses both psychological and neurological aspects of the condition [^1118QcoE].

### Evaluation of a new body-focused group therapy versus a guided self-help group program for adults with psychogenic non-epileptic seizures (PNES): a pilot randomized controlled feasibility study [^11654YHE]. Journal of Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Psychogenic non-epileptic seizures (PNES) are paroxysmal episodes characterized by the loss of voluntary control over body functions that are usually intentional. Non-epileptic seizures resemble epileptic seizures but are not related to abnormal electrical activity in the brain. The prevalence of PNES in the general population has been estimated at 2–50/100.000. In general neurology outpatient clinics, PNES account for 2% of new referrals. In tertiary Epilepsy units, the proportion of PNES among all patients is around 30%. The aetiology of PNES is still subject to research. Theoretical psychological models assume that PNES occur in response to distressing stimuli when alternative coping mechanisms are inadequate or have been overwhelmed. The occurrence of PNES is often associated with psychological trauma and posttraumatic stress disorder. Current treatment recommendations rely on psychological interventions after a thorough workup. Antiepileptic drugs are neither indicated nor helpful in PNES. Although caring for PNES patients thus usually demands an interdisciplinary approach, they are often solely treated either in neurological or in psychiatric/psychosomatic settings, leading to disadvantages in treatment quality.

Despite the high frequency of PNES in clinical settings, there are surprisingly few studies of high methodological quality focusing on guideline-oriented treatment options for PNES. Three previous pilot treatment trials have focused on cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) programs for PNES patients. The first two monocentric studies showed that a structured CBT treatment may reduce the seizure frequency in PNES. There is one multicentric study from 2020 involving 368 patients. This study revealed that a structured CBT treatment plus standard medical care was superior to only standard medical care regarding the outcome of the burden of somatic symptoms, bothersomeness of seizures, the general quality of life, work and social life functioning, and overall psychological distress. Based on those pilot trials in the English-speaking area, we developed a body-focused group therapy program in German. Its content is presented in detail in a previous publication, including cognitive-behavioural aspects that are already established in the existing English treatment programs. A new aspect is that it also involves a body-focused psychotherapy approach with symptom-specific exercises. This body-focused approach refers to the German guidelines for the treatment of functional body symptoms. In those guidelines, the involvement of body-focused psychotherapy is recommended due to the body-focused symptomatology of the disease.

### Recognition of psychogenic non-epileptic seizures: a curable neurophobia? [^11352icz]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Diagnosing psychogenic non-epileptic seizures (PNES) remains challenging. The majority of 'PNES status' cases are likely to be seen in the emergency department or similar non-specialised units, where patients are initially assessed and managed by physicians of varying expertise in neurology.

Methods

216 participants including medical students and doctors of all grades from a wide range of medical disciplines were shown video recordings of six patients with PNES and six other patients with convulsive epileptic seizures (ES). Participants were asked to choose between PNES and ES as a diagnosis and to rate their confidence in each diagnosis, both before and after a 15-minute teaching presentation on PNES and ES.

Results

Pre-teaching sensitivity for diagnosing PNES was 0.77, specificity 0.55. The positive predictive value (PPV) of diagnosing PNES was 0.63, and was 0.7 for ES. Diagnostic accuracy increased with increasing clinical grades (p = 0.022), as did clinical confidence (p < 0.0005). Clinical accuracy and clinical confidence increased post-teaching (p < 0.0005). Sensitivity for diagnosing PNES post-teaching improved to 0.88, specificity to 0.67. The PPV of diagnosing PNES increased to 0.72, and to 0.84 for ES.

Conclusions

Diagnosing PNES can be improved by clinical experience in neurology and focussed teaching interventions.

Psychiatric Comorbidity and Traumatic Brain Injury Attribution in Patients With Psychogenic Nonepileptic or Epileptic Seizures: A Multicenter Study of US Veterans Salinsky M, Rutecki P, Parko K, Goy E, Storzbach D, O'Neil M, Binder L, Joos S. Epilepsia. 2018. Epub ahead of print. https://doi.org/10.1111/epi.14542 Objective: To determine the frequency and severity of psychiatric disorders and attribution of seizures to traumatic brain injury (TBI) in veterans with verified psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES) versus epileptic seizures (ES).

Methods

We studied 333 consecutive admissions to the monitoring units of 3 Veterans Administration epilepsy centers. All patients underwent continuous video-electroencephalographic recording to define definite PNES or ES. Evaluations included the Structured Clinical Interview for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) Checklist, Beck Depression Inventory II, and Patient Seizure Etiology Questionnaire. Interviews and questionnaires were completed prior to final seizure type diagnosis and patient debriefing. The primary outcome measure was a comparison of Axis I psychiatric diagnoses in patients diagnosed with PNES versus ES.

Results

A total of 81 patients were diagnosed with PNES and 70 with ES. Posttraumatic stress disorder was the most frequent Axis I diagnosis in veterans with PNES (64% vs 13% of those with ES; P < .001). Posttraumatic stress disorder was common regardless of deployment to a war theater or combat exposure. Mood, substance abuse, and anxiety disorders were also more common in the PNES group. Traumatic brain injury was cited as a likely cause of seizures by 47% of veterans with PNES versus 25% of those with ES (P = 0.01). Posttraumatic stress disorder and attribution of seizures to TBI were found in 30% of veterans with PNES versus 3% of those with ES (P < .001).

Significance

In veterans referred for inpatient seizure evaluation, PTSD was strongly associated with a diagnosis of PNES versus ES. The association of PNES with PTSD, attribution of seizures to TBI, or both, may prompt early consideration of PNES.

### Perceptions in PNES: a bidirectional problem [^113hxScX]. Epilepsy Currents (2019). Medium credibility.

Health Care Practitioners' Perceptions of Psychogenic Nonepileptic Seizures: A Systematic Review of Qualitative and Quantitative Studies Rawlings GH, Reuber M. Epilepsia. 2018;59(6):1109–1123. doi:10.1111/epi.14189. Epub 2018 May 11. A recent systematic synthesis of qualitative research demonstrated that patients with psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES) often experience unsatisfactory encounters with health-care practitioners (HCPs). It is important to understand such interactions from the perspective of those responsible for delivering care. This systematic review aimed to examine the attitudes and perceptions of HCPs toward PNES. A systematic search of 3 databases (Web of Science, PubMed, and CINAHL) was conducted in November 2017. Studies from around the world published after 1997 using qualitative or quantitative methodologies were reviewed. An interpretative stance was taken to analyze the data utilizing a grounded theory approach. The quality of studies included was assessed using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool. Overall, 30 separate studies capturing the views of at least 3900 professionals were included. Five concepts emerged from the analysis: (1) HCPs' responses demonstrated uncertainty about many aspects of PNES, including diagnosis and treatment; (2) HCPs understood PNES in dualistic terms, perceiving the condition as largely associated with psychological factors; (3) patients with PNES were considered challenging and frustrating; (4) HCPs held mixed or contested views about who is responsible for treating patients with PNES; and (5) PNES was viewed as less severe or disabling than epilepsy and associated with a greater degree of volition. Although some HCPs have an excellent understanding of PNES, the views of many give rise to concern. The number of qualitative studies that directly ask HCPs about their perceptions of PNES is limited. Moreover, some professional groups (ie, mental health specialists) are underrepresented in current research. This study reveals a demand for additional training. However, effort is needed also to change the attitudes of some practitioners toward PNES.

### Psychoses of epilepsy: unravelling the phenotypic and genotypic features [^114C97ZM]. Annals of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Psychosis of epilepsy is not a single disorder, but a complex entity with diverse phenotypes based on symptom presentation, duration, chronicity, and outcomes. Postictal and interictal psychoses are each underscored by distinct neurobiological mechanisms that are both epilepsy‐ and etiologically related. Recognizing the heterogeneity of POE informs understanding of the genetic basis and, in the future, will guide diagnosis and the development of targeted therapies for individuals with epilepsy who present with psychosis.

### Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of syncope (version 2009) [^114adUcD]. European Heart Journal (2009). Medium credibility.

Electroencephalography (EEG) in suspected syncope — use and limitations: Interictal EEGs are normal in syncope, and an interictal normal EEG cannot rule out epilepsy and must be interpreted in a clinical context; when uncertain it is better to postpone the diagnosis of epilepsy than falsely diagnose it. An EEG is not recommended when syncope is the most likely cause of T-LOC, but it is when epilepsy is the likely cause or when clinical data are equivocal. The EEG may be useful to establish psychogenic pseudosyncope if recorded during a provoked attack.

---

### Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of syncope (version 2009) [^116VRGie]. European Heart Journal (2009). Medium credibility.

Transient loss of consciousness (T-LOC) — classification framework — separates presentations into traumatic and non-traumatic forms. Concussion usually causes loss of consciousness and, because the presence of a trauma is usually clear, the risk of diagnostic confusion is limited. Non-traumatic T-LOC is divided into syncope, epileptic seizures, psychogenic pseudosyncope, and rare miscellaneous causes.

### Diagnostic delay in psychogenic nonepileptic seizures [^114aJrhC]. Neurology (2002). Low credibility.

Delay to diagnosis was studied in 313 consecutive patients with psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES). On average, patients with PNES were diagnosed 7.2 years after manifestation (SD 9.3 years). Younger age, interictal epileptiform potentials in the EEG, and anticonvulsant treatment were associated with longer delays. Other patient factors did not explain the great variability of the time to diagnosis, suggesting that physician factors contributed to delays.

### A disciplined approach to treatment of psychogenic nonepileptic seizures [^116n1mWu]. Epilepsy Currents (2022). Medium credibility.

Psychogenic nonepileptic seizures continue to challenge conventional wisdom, and the current medical literature has grown in terms of studies for characterization of events as well as for treatment. For any clinician straddling fields of psychiatry and neurology, the progress has been gratifying if not always enlightening in terms of evidence-based algorithmic approaches. Still, it is true that with each publication that emerges, new perspectives are appreciated, from the idea that treatment works, to the utility of creative methods of service delivery. The study by Fredwall and colleaguesis no exception, and lends new insight that extends well beyond the concrete results.

The initial appeal of the study is that it was done in pediatrics, a historically understudied population in both psychiatry and neurology. Additionally, the study offers a longitudinal perspective, which is uncommon in pediatric treatment studies in any discipline. The study itself is very concise and straightforward. Active patients who were identified as having PNES following an epilepsy monitoring unit stay were followed after referral to a specialized multidisciplinary PNES clinical program. Clinical visits routinely included both a neurologist and a psychologist at the same visit. Additional contact with nurses and social workers also occurred to arrange follow-up care or referrals. For the study, nurses contacted families at 1-, 3-, and 12-month time points and inquired about the persistence of events, functionality, and acceptance of the PNES diagnosis. Involvement in mental health services such as psychotherapy was also assessed, and although psychotherapy was not necessarily delivered by the program, assistance was provided by members of the multidisciplinary team not only to explain the diagnosis, but also to facilitate referrals and to engage support services.

### Psychological characteristics of patients with newly developed psychogenic seizures [^117WXar3]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

Objectives

To assess psychopathological symptoms and history of childhood trauma in patients with newly developed psychogenic seizures.

Methods

Using validated scales, 178 patients from the general population diagnosed with newly developed seizures were assessed, at a point in time when the nature of their seizures was yet unknown to either doctors or patients. After standardised neurological examination, 138 patients were diagnosed with non-psychogenic seizures (NPS), while 40 patients were found to have psychogenic seizures (PS). To evaluate possible differences between the genders and the diagnostic groups, univariate analyses of variance were done.

Results

PS patients reported significantly more comorbid psychopathological complaints, dissociative experiences, anxiety, and self-reported childhood trauma than NPS patients. In addition, PS patients had lower quality of life ratings than NPS patients. These effects were not modulated by gender.

Conclusions

The results of the present study indicate that patients with newly developed PS constitute a group with complex psychopathological features that warrant early detection and treatment.

### Seizures, driver licensure, and medical reporting update: an AAN position statement [^114Hzk2t]. Neurology (2025). High credibility.

Functional seizures (also known as psychogenic nonepileptic seizures) — Given limited data, we recommend that individuals with functional seizures involving alterations in responsiveness and/or involuntary movements potentially affecting their ability to control a vehicle receive driving counseling and restriction similar to that given to individuals with epileptic seizures. In parallel to individuals with epileptic seizures, we recommend that individuals with functional seizures (with a semiology likely to disrupt driving) be restricted from driving until free of functional seizures for a minimum of 3 months (or the relevant state's required seizure-free interval for epileptic seizures). We recommend that the required seizure-free interval be subject to modification based on individual review by the treating clinician and/or medical advisory board, with more stringent restrictions for individuals seeking licensure as professional drivers, and the page notes evidence on collision risk is extremely limited though such events do occur and may be more frequent than in epileptic seizures.

### Treatment works, so who's afraid of PNES? [^112PRkgo]. Epilepsy Currents (2019). Medium credibility.

Commentary

Despite the large literature based on psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES), it is still difficult to ascertain "evidence-based treatment" and to gain a comfort level in managing this condition. Psychogenic nonepileptic seizures are ubiquitous in clinical epilepsy practice and may represent up to 30% of epilepsy monitoring unit admissions. Prospective treatment studies that may guide clinical practice are emerging but still uncommon. Some reports highlight the perceived lack of access to mental health care; others critique working relationships between neurologists and psychiatrists. - The literature also shows that nomenclature has oscillated wildly over the years. Some authors prefer to use the word "events" instead of seizures, and the term psychogenic has gradually become more present in order to characterize apparent psychological etiologies from other epilepsy mimics. Although unfortunate, it is true that in medicine, deeming a condition, "psychogenic" is often a pathway for nonpsychiatrists to abdicate a treatment relationship.

Regrettably, relatively few papers in the epilepsy literature have focused upon how actually to improve the clinical state of patients with this condition. When evidence arrives from prospective treatment of PNES, it is refreshing, and Tolchin et al have provided longitudinal data that are worthy for consumption. Over 100 patients with documented PNES were followed prospectively, essentially for the purpose of determining whether they attended psychotherapy appointments. Treatment aspects varied though consultation was facilitated between study clinicians and therapists regarding possible treatment approaches and the scope of PNES. Episode frequency and quality of life were measured at baseline and after a 1- to 2-year period. The results suggested that increased attendance at psychotherapy visits was associated with reduction in episodes, reduction in emergency department (ED) utilization, and improved quality of life. The improvement occurred regardless of specific philosophical bent, for example, dynamic or cognitive behavioral, and even though complete "seizure" freedom had not typically occurred. Although causality could not be attributed, the fact that treatment was associated with a sustained improved outcome after 1 to 2 years is a legitimate cause for optimism.

### Depression and symptoms affect quality of life in psychogenic nonepileptic seizures [^116unUcB]. Neurology (2009). Low credibility.

Background

In patients with active epilepsy, adverse medication effects and severity of depression are correlated with health-related quality of life, but seizure frequency is not. We sought to examine if the same pattern exists in patients with psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES).

Methods

We administered seizure calendars, quality of life (QOL) scales, depression scales, and symptom checklists to 49 patients with video EEG-confirmed PNES. Data analysis consisted of performing Pearson correlation coefficients, scatter plots, and t tests.

Results

Depression and symptom scores significantly increased as health-related QOL scores decreased (partial correlation coefficient r = -0.73 for both comparisons), whereas seizure count was nonsignificant (partial correlation coefficient r = -0.19).

Conclusions

As is seen in epilepsy, patients with psychogenic nonepileptic seizures demonstrate that higher depressive symptoms and somatic symptoms are independently related to worsening quality of life (QOL); however, seizure frequency is not. Seizure frequency is an important focus in patient care and treatment trials. The findings underscore the importance of, along with seizure counts, also examining QOL, depression, and somatic symptoms in patients with seizures.

### Furthering the evidence of comorbid psychiatric disorders in pediatric patients with psychogenic nonepileptic seizures [^111nh3YY]. Epilepsy Currents (2021). Medium credibility.

What Happens to These Patients After the PNES diagnosis?

The present study found that 39.1% of the PNES patients developed new psychiatric disorders after being diagnosed with PNES. The range of new psychiatric diagnoses (incident psychiatric diagnoses) included emotional disorders (anxiety and mood disorders), adjustment disorders, and neurodevelopmental disorders including ADHD, ASD, OCD, and tics. Additionally, > 40% of the PNES population received their first incident psychiatric diagnosis within 2 months of the diagnosis of PNES. As authors admit, it is very likely that the diagnosis of ES or PNES could bring greater attention to psychiatric comorbidity and therefore could have made it easier to identify new psychiatric problems. In Denmark, most of these psychiatric diagnostic codes were however found from inpatient hospital admissions — hence, irrespective of whether these incident psychiatric diagnoses were highlighted due to the PNES diagnosis, they were severe enough to merit inpatient treatment. It is therefore critical to establish psychiatric follow-up of PNES patients at the time of initial PNES diagnosis. Somatic symptom–related disorders (SSRD) were also prominent in the present PNES cohort. Hence, thorough screening for prevalent SSRD is indicated.

Treatment of PNES

Who oversees treating PNES? The authors indicate that their findings are important in planning the care of PNES patients. As indicated in the service gaps identified by ILAE, most level 3 or 4 epilepsy centers in the USA diagnose patients, but do not treat after initial PNES diagnosis. In a prior publication on assessing patient perspectives about PNES, Rawlings et al highlight patient feelings of diagnostic uncertainty and abandonment. In 2018, Rawlings et al also assessed healthcare practitioners' (HCPs) attitudes toward PNES. HCPs identified PNES as a psychosocial phenomenon, and treatment responsibilities were contested among various specialists with neurologists making the diagnosis in wealthier countries and psychiatrists in poorer nations. Adopting a multidisciplinary approach to diagnosis and follow-up care using clinical care pathways has been associated with greater success in the treatment of these children.

In conclusion, PNES can no longer remain a no man's land. This study highlights the bidirectional relationship between PNES and psychiatric disorders. At a time of increasing mental health needs of children and adolescents in general and PNES patients in particular, coordinated care between epileptologists and psychiatrists/psychologists is the need of the hour.

### Epilepsy benchmarks area IV: limit or prevent adverse consequence of seizures and their treatment across the life span [^116z91qP]. Epilepsy Currents (2020). Medium credibility.

Psychogenic Nonepileptic Seizures

Psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNESs), thought to be a physiological response to psychiatric distress, require high rates of medical resources associated with elevated medical costs, including emergency department resources as well as inpatient epilepsy monitoring unit visits. Practice guidelines for the diagnosis of PNES were developed in 2013, and more recent focus has been on treatment gaps across cultures with the International League Against Epilepsy NES Task Force report. A recent study sought to provide information on prevalence, risk factors, and psychiatric comorbidity in these varied groups. Outside the United States and European countries, access to diagnostic tools, standardized methods for assessment, and communicating the diagnosis remain challenging. A multicenter study found a clear relationship between diagnostic and treatment services for PNES and a country's economic status. When standardized diagnostic procedures and a uniform approach to initial treatment of symptoms were utilized, a positive impact on quality of life was reported.

Treatment was the largest area of growth in research on PNES; however, few studies were randomized controlled trials. Specific types of treatment were explored, such as prolonged exposure therapy (evidence-based cognitive–behavioral therapy, CBT) in individuals with PNES and posttraumatic stress disorder and abbreviated CBT-based psychoeducation. A meta-analysis of 13 eligible treatment studies included CBT and other modalities with reported improvement for individuals engaging in treatment as opposed to those who did not attend treatment for PNES. Similarly, a prospective follow-up study of adults with PNES was found to have decreased emergency room utilization and improved quality of life in association with adherence with psychotherapy.

There continues to be a lack of providers engaging in treatment for PNES. Based on limited data, long-term outcomes appear to be poor, particularly in the absence of treatment. Finally, given known unique risk factors in children, future treatment trials should include diverse populations, including those with concurrent epilepsy using an interdisciplinary approach.

### Furthering the evidence of comorbid psychiatric disorders in pediatric patients with psychogenic nonepileptic seizures [^117Xda4E]. Epilepsy Currents (2021). Medium credibility.

Etiology of PNES

There is no single etiological theory to explain PNES. The biopsychosocial model of PNESidentifies predisposing factors (including genetic, temperamental (behavioral/psychiatric), neurologic comorbidities, and early life trauma), precipitating factors (stressful physical/mental events), and perpetuating factors (lack of social support, avoidance, and isolation) in PNES. Although there is an overall understanding that premorbid psychiatric disorders are common in patients with PNES, the extent of these in pediatric patients had not been well studied so far outside of small series. In the present study, forty percent of the children (153/384) had prevalent psychiatric diagnoses before the diagnosis of PNES. The risk of prevalent psychiatric disorders was almost 2 times higher than in ES and 6 times higher than in HC. Additionally, the risk of incident psychiatric disorders was 2 times higher than in ES and 8 times higher than in HC. The spectrum of the prevalent psychiatric diagnoses included emotional disorders, adjustment disorders, neurodevelopmental disorders, and intellectual disorders in the PNES population, providing strong evidence of psychiatric and intellectual predisposing factors at a population level.

Diagnosis of PNES

The authors used clinically established methods to ascertain diagnosis (clinical characteristics and witnessed semiology). Although patients were not diagnosed with a video EEG, which is considered to be the gold standard in PNES diagnosis, the ILAE recommends recognizing PNES at lower levels of diagnosis to assess epidemiology since not all countries have access to video EEG. These same authors have also validated the positive predictive value of their clinically based diagnosis of PNES, further supporting this approach.

### Psychogenic nonepileptic seizures: diagnosis, management, and Bioethics [^115tjAdW]. Pediatric Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The diagnosis and management of psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES) is often challenging and fraught with discord and disagreement between patients, parents, and physicians. Furthermore, there are ethical challenges when making the diagnosis, communicating this information, and instituting management.

Methods

We reviewed the current body of knowledge regarding the characteristic differences between epileptic seizures and PNES, and the high incidence of psychiatric comorbidities. An ethical analysis was made of diagnosis and management based on ethical principles, virtue ethics, and the social contract that health professionals have with patients.

Results

Key distinctions between PNES and epilepsy lie in both patient and seizure characteristics. Long duration, eye closure, asynchronous movements, frequent recurrence in the same context, intra-ictal awareness, and lack of post ictal state are useful in helping establish the diagnosis. Psychiatric comorbidities, history of abuse, cognitive impairment, and multiple non specific somatic complaints are some salient patient features that should increase suspicion for the diagnosis of PNES. However, definitive diagnosis rests on capturing the events on video EEG.

Conclusion

Effective diagnosis and management of PNES requires the use of video EEG and an early collaborative approach between pediatricians, neurologists, psychiatrists, nursing staff, and other professional colleagues. Ethical questions that may arise should be addressed with the virtues of competence, courage, compassion, prudence, and honesty; and the principles of respect beneficence, and the avoidance of unnecessary harm.

### Increased suicide attempt risk in people with epilepsy in the presence of concurrent psychogenic nonepileptic seizures [^117Juqrh]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study quantifying the risk of attempting suicide associated to a lifetime diagnosis of concurrent epilepsy and PNES, as compared with epilepsy alone and PNES alone. We show that in the presence of concurrent PNES, the odds of people with epilepsy to be hospitalised for a first suicide attempt are 152% higher than when epilepsy occurs in isolation. For people with PNES alone the odds of attempting suicide are 93% higher than the odds of people with epilepsy alone, while people with PNES alone and people with a concurrent diagnosis are at comparable risk. These associations are observed also after controlling for the influence of comorbid psychiatric diagnoses. The estimates represent a measure of total effect, which is a clinically intuitive measure of the overall risk associated to the presence of a diagnosis and its accompanying clinical profile, for any gender and ethnicity.

These findings have relevant and direct implication for risk assessment and management in clinical practice. When assessing and managing suicide risk in people with epilepsy, clinicians should be aware of the additional risk imposed by the concurrent presence of PNES. Given the substantial proportion (12%) of PNES in people with epilepsy, we identify this as a high-risk group that should be a target for enhanced risk monitoring and preventive psychosocial interventions.

Our study highlights the need to identify and implement effective risk prevention methods; strategies such as improving recognition and management of PNES are crucial. Confirming the diagnosis of PNES is a long process and a clinical challenge, and misdiagnosis of PNES as epilepsy is common. It is therefore essential to investigate cases where there is a suspicion for coexisting seizure typesand to acknowledge diagnostic uncertainty; failing to do so could lead to underestimation of risk in a population that is already at elevated risk of suicide, and for whom prevention of premature mortality is a top priority.

### Discovering themes in medical records of patients with psychogenic non-epileptic seizures [^112udeh8]. BMJ Neurology Open (2020). High credibility.

Conclusions

Our study shows that unsupervised machine learning can be used to objectively and efficiently evaluate large chunks of unsorted medical data. This provides a good starting point for subsequent deeper analysis by highlighting key themes. Additionally, our study also has implications for the understanding of the thinking process of healthcare workers at the time of evaluating patients presenting with seizures. The analysis of a larger sample of patients presenting with ES and PNES would be useful to detect different topics between the two seizure types in order to design a way of improving the diagnosis based on the topic modelling approach.

### Occurrence of status epilepticus in persons with epilepsy is determined by sex, epilepsy classification, and etiology: a single center cohort study [^115RXN71]. Journal of Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Psychogenic non-epileptic seizures as a comorbidity were more common in the group with a history of SE, although absolute numbers were small. The treating physician took care to differentiate psychogenic and epileptic seizures in the interview to reduce the risk of falsely including a prolonged psychogenic seizure as SE. It would be an interesting question for further studies whether psychogenic seizures are indeed associated with a more severe disease course or other complications of epilepsy.

The survey showed a lower rate of seizure-free patients in the subgroup with SE. This is in line with a meta-analysis of risk factors for drug-resistant epilepsy. Low ASM levels are commonly named as the most frequent etiology of SE in persons with epilepsy. In this study, patients rarely (in only 7%) recalled changes of ASM regime or missed doses as provocative factors. Most patients (69%) did not recall any specific catalytic circumstance. The discrepancy may be explained by patient recruitment, as most population-based studies recruit hospitalized SE patients. SE due to low ASM levels usually requires loading with ASM and may be overrepresented among hospitalized patients.

Only two-thirds of the patients expressed knowledge about prolonged seizures and SE. With SE being a potentially hazardous complication of epilepsy and rescue medication being available, patient education needs to be improved. Surprisingly, even 21% of those with a history of a prolonged seizure seemed not to be aware of the significance. A large majority voted for a discussion of SE at the initial epilepsy diagnosis. This desire has clearly not been met for most patients. Certainly, the discussion of the disease and its medical, social and emotional consequences at the initial diagnosis has to be conducted with care. Mentioning life-threatening complications like SE can be challenging and, of course, should be undertaken cautiously. On the other hand, discussing rescue medication may help the patient and family feel more confident. Knowledge about rescue medication for prolonged seizures was — unsurprisingly — more common in the group with SE. Still, 14% did not know about its availability.

### Treatment works, so who's afraid of PNES? [^117Kh9A8]. Epilepsy Currents (2019). Medium credibility.

Adherence With Psychotherapy and Treatment Outcomes for Psychogenic Nonepileptic Seizures Tolchin B, Dworetzky BA, Martino S, et al. Neurology. 2019;92(7):e675-e679. doi:10.1212/WNL.0000000000006848.

Objective

We conducted a prospective cohort study of patients with psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES) to examine the association between adherence to psychotherapy and outcomes, including significant (≥ 50%) reduction in PNES frequency, PNES freedom, improvement in quality of life, and reduction in emergency department (ED) utilization.

Methods

A total of 105 participants were referred to receive psychotherapy either at Brigham and Women's Hospital or with a local therapist. We called participants at 12 to 24 months of follow-up and obtained detailed follow-up data from 93 (89%) participants. Participants were considered adherent to psychotherapy if they attended at least 8 sessions within a 16-week period starting at the time of referral.

Results

Adherence to psychotherapy was associated with reduction in seizure frequency (84% in adherent group vs 61% in nonadherent; p = 0.021), improvement in quality of life (P = 0.044), and reduction in ED utilization (P = 0.040), with medium effect sizes; there was no difference in PNES freedom. The association between adherence and ≥ 50% reduction in PNES frequency persisted when controlling for potential confounders in a multivariate model. Psychotherapy nonadherence was associated with baseline characteristics of self-identified minority status (odds ratio: 7.47; p = 0.019) and history of childhood abuse (odds ratio: 3.30; p = 0.023).

Conclusions

Our study is limited in that it cannot establish a causal relationship between adherence to psychotherapy and outcomes, and the results may not generalize beyond the single quaternary care center study site. Among participants with documented PNES, adherence to psychotherapy was associated with reduction in PNES frequency, improvement in quality of life, and decrease in ED visits.

### Seizures, nonepileptic events, trauma, anxiety, or all of the above [^113szX5M]. Epilepsy Currents (2019). Medium credibility.

Commentary

The association of epilepsy and anxiety continues to be frequently observed and confirmed. However, oddly enough, the association of psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES) and anxiety has been less well established. It is intuitive to consider that anxiety may lead to PNES, though this is a difficult point to prove because anxiety itself is heterogeneous. It may still be inadequate to say that anxiety disorders are uniformly present in PNES, and even more speculative to claim causality, even though the intuition for such association is quite strong.

Salinsky et al have brought us much closer to answer this etiologic question. The population studied encompasses veterans, clearly a group that is forced to confront anxiety. Prospectively enrolled patients with questionable paroxysms underwent observation on an inpatient epilepsy monitoring unit in order to assess whether PNES or electrical seizures were present. Impressively, a solid psychiatric assessment was done for each patient, including a structured diagnostic interview, the gold standard for diagnosing psychiatric conditions. For corroboration, the investigators also used well-established questionnaires to verify the presence of posttraumatic stress disorder (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders [Fourth Edition]) and other anxiety symptoms. The Beck depression scale and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) scales are useful tools, and regardless of any other shortcomings of the study, the authors deserve credit for thinking to use such assessment tools prospectively.

The results show that PTSD is more common in those with PNES and that patients with PNES attribute their symptoms to a head injury more often than do those with electrical seizures. Additionally, psychiatric illness, particularly mood and anxiety disorders, were more often present in those with PNES than those with epilepsy. The investigators performed the psychiatric evaluations prior to the epilepsy monitoring, which effectively reduces bias of the findings.

The results are intriguing and may offer tangible evidence of the relationship between anxiety, and epilepsy, and PNES. Simply finding such clear relationships is notable and important. Characterization of psychiatric illness in epilepsy as well as in PNES has been challenging for many years, despite persisting clinical suspicions. Some groups have found reasonable associations of psychiatric illness with PNES, but subgroups with marked exposure to stress, such as veterans, have been infrequently studied even though they may be a higher yield population with which to find such an association.

### Psychogenic nonepileptic seizures… [^115u85xY]. JAMA Network (2014). Excellent credibility.

Trial Registration clinicaltrials. gov Identifier: NCT00835627 Psychogenic nonepileptic seizures are a somatoform conversion disorder manifesting as paroxysmal events not associated with electroencephalographic epileptiform correlates, and they have psychological underpinnings. 1 They are not responsive to treatment with, and may be worsened. by, antiepileptic drugs. 2, 3 They occur worldwide, and in the United States up to 20% of civilians and up to 25% of veterans diagnosed as having epilepsy actually have PNES, 4 making PNES as common as multiple sclerosis and Parkinson disease5 and as disabling as epilepsy. 6 The phenomenology and psychological underpinnings of PNES are well delineated, including an understanding of risk factors and prognostic features. 7 Much less is known, however, about effective treatments for PNES, resulting in many patients returning to neurology offices and emergency departments because of recurrent seizures.

Prior pilot treatment trials revealed that sertraline hydrochloride or cognitive behavioral therapy may be effective in reducing PNES. Patients receiving sertraline reported a 45% reduction in PNES, compared with an 8% increase in PNES in the placebo group. 13 An open-label psychotherapy study for PNES10 used an epilepsy therapy workbook14 modified to target dysfunctional cognitions and behaviors in patients with PNES. 15 Eleven of 17 individual therapy intervention completers reported no seizures by the end of the 12-week trial. Criteria for the diagnosis of events consisted of stereotypic motor manifestations with or without change in level of consciousness. 18 Exclusion criteria included the following: concurrent mixed epilepsy and PNES or equivocal video EEG findings in discerning between epileptic seizures and PNES; use of monoamine oxidase inhibitor or pimozide within.

30 days prior to study entry; current use of sumatriptan succinate or other serotonin 1 receptor agonist; allergy or sensitivity to sertraline; current enrollment in CBT for PNES; current or past-year self-mutilation; frank psychosis; current suicidality with intent to harm self; serious illness; active substance or alcohol use or dependence that could interfere with participation; pending litigation; and current application for long-term disability. The consistency of multiple comorbidities and stressors composes, in effect, the homogeneity of PNES. This intervention therefore treats patients with PNES, with all of their heterogeneities. 25.

### International multicenter studies on psychogenic nonepileptic seizures: a systematic review [^115fBVgB]. Psychiatry Research (2020). Medium credibility.

The aim of the current paper is to systematically review the literature on the existing international multicenter studies on various aspects of PNES and to highlight their findings and significance. I searched the electronic database PubMed for articles that included any of these search terms: Non-epileptic seizures, Nonepileptic seizures, Pseudoseizures, Non-epileptic events, Nonepileptic events, Dissociative seizures, Psychogenic, PNES, AND "international" or "multicenter" or "cross cultural", in their abstracts and titles and published before August 6, 2019. I searched PsycINFO database (keywords in the abstracts) and also included some of the references of the selected articles if they were relevant. I could identify 12 related manuscripts through the search strategy. These included seven studies on patients with PNES, two surveys, and three consensus group reports. This systematic review showed that international and cross-cultural studies on PNES to date are very limited in number and quality. However, these limited studies have resulted in intriguing observations and conclusions. International and cross-cultural studies may make important contributions to our understanding of different aspects of PNES across borders.

### Psychogenic nonepileptic seizures [^112LZpZD]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Psychogenic nonepileptic seizures are episodes of movement, sensation, or behaviors that are similar to epileptic seizures but do not have a neurologic origin; rather, they are somatic manifestations of psychologic distress. Patients with psychogenic nonepileptic seizures frequently are misdiagnosed and treated for epilepsy. Video-electroencephalography monitoring is preferred for diagnosis. From 5 to 10 percent of outpatient epilepsy patients and 20 to 40 percent of inpatient epilepsy patients have psychogenic nonepileptic seizures. These patients inevitably have comorbid psychiatric illnesses, most commonly depression, posttraumatic stress disorder, other dissociative and somatoform disorders, and personality pathology, especially borderline personality type. Many patients have a history of sexual or physical abuse. Between 75 and 85 percent of patients with psychogenic nonepileptic seizures are women. Psychogenic nonepileptic seizures typically begin in young adulthood. Treatment involves discontinuation of antiepileptic drugs in patients without concurrent epilepsy and referral for appropriate psychiatric care. More studies are needed to determine the best treatment modalities.

### Pilot pharmacologic randomized controlled trial for psychogenic nonepileptic seizures [^112eX7r4]. Neurology (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

There have been few treatment trials for psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES). Some psychotherapies have been shown to improve PNES and comorbid symptom outcomes. We evaluated a pharmacologic intervention to test the hypothesis that sertraline would reduce PNES.

Methods

We conducted a pilot, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial in an academic medical hospital with epilepsy center outpatients. Subjects aged 18 to 65 years diagnosed with video-EEG-confirmed PNES were treated with flexible-dose sertraline or placebo over 12 weeks. Seizure calendars and symptom scales were charted prospectively. Secondary outcome measures included psychiatric symptom scales and psychosocial variables.

Results

Thirty-eight subjects enrolled, and 26 (68%) completed the trial. Thirty-three subjects with nonzero nonepileptic seizure rates at baseline were included in intent-to-treat analysis of the primary outcome. Subjects assigned to the sertraline arm experienced a 45% reduction in seizure rates from baseline to final visit (p = 0.03) vs an 8% increase in placebo (p = 0.78). Secondary outcome scales revealed no significant between-group differences in change scores from baseline to final visit, after adjustment for differences at baseline.

Conclusions

PNES were reduced in patients treated with a serotonin selective reuptake inhibitor, whereas those treated with placebo slightly increased. This study provides feasibility data for a larger-scale study.

Level Of Evidence

This study provides Class II evidence that flexible-dose sertraline up to a maximum dose of 200 mg is associated with a nonsignificant reduction in PNES rate compared with a placebo control arm (risk ratio 0.51, 95% confidence interval 0.25–1.05, p = 0.29), adjusting for differences at baseline.

### Psychogenic non-epileptic seizures in early Huntington's disease [^113WFax6]. Practical Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Huntington's disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative condition characterised by motor dysfunction with involuntary movements and loss of voluntary control, cognitive deterioration and psychiatric problems. We report a 51-year-old man with early HD who experienced stereotyped episodes of repetitive, purposeless complex movements and unresponsiveness. His neurological examination was compatible with HD as were all investigations. We diagnosed psychogenic non-epileptic seizures. While seizures are common in juvenile-onset HD, they are no more prevalent in adult-onset HD than in the general population. However, neuropsychiatric symptoms are common in HD and can involve a number of different complaints. Patients may experience dissociative attacks soon after manifesting a HD diagnosis. Such episodes can be managed with patient and carer education, cognitive behavioural therapy and anxiolytic selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors.

### Evaluation after a first seizure in adults [^114PJCAx]. American Family Physician (2022). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for first seizure in adults, more specifically with respect to electroencephalography, AAFP 2022 guidelines recommend to obtain video-EEG monitoring during seizure-like activity to diagnose psychogenic nonepileptic seizures, although up to 5% of patients diagnosed with psychogenic nonepileptic seizures are eventually diagnosed with epilepsy.

### Misdiagnosis of prolonged psychogenic non-epileptic seizures as status epilepticus: epidemiology and associated risks [^111DgGJJ]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2021). Medium credibility.

Another factor underlying the 'shoot first' mentality of convulsive status treatment is the purported lack of reliability of semiological seizure diagnosis. Indeed, semiology alone can be insufficient for a firm diagnosis for many types of seizures and seizure-like events. However, suspected convulsive status epilepticus has pronounced motor symptoms, allowing for a confident diagnosis on clinical grounds in most cases. A recent study on smartphone video recordings of seizures found that convulsive PNES can be identified with 96% accuracy on video. Moreover, examination of ongoing seizures allows for quick assessment of interactive responsivity (e.g. resistance to eye-opening, preservation of pupillary and eyelash reflexes, change in seizure intensity in response to others), which can offer near-absolute specificity for PNES. Filming an ongoing seizure for later specialist evaluation should be encouraged as a critical diagnostic intervention and can be justified as such even without prior consent. Paramedics, emergency department staff, neurologists, and intensivists should be sensitised regarding the relative incidence of PNES and trained in semiological recognition of seizure types to reduce the rate of misdiagnosis and the risk of harm from overtreatment. The importance of obtaining ictal video, early EEG and postictal laboratory markers such as prolactin and creatine kinase should inform emergency work-up algorithms to reduce misdiagnosis.

The observed rates of pPNES misdiagnosis and risks of harm from non-indicated treatment should give cause to reconsider status epilepticus response protocols, especially in clinical trials. Highly specific semiological indicators of pPNES should be considered at enrolment and pPNES should be explicitly listed as exclusion criteria. Clinical reassessment, possibly operationalised through semiological checklists, should further be required at every step of treatment escalation. As misdiagnosed pPNES can be expected at a rate of 5%–10%, specific protocols for de-escalation and reallocation of treatment should ideally be provided to trialists. Lastly, study analysis plans should include separate epidemiological and safety subanalyses for patients later diagnosed with pPNES.

### An update on psychogenic nonepileptic seizures [^111rRUa8]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The understanding of psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES) has advanced steadily over recent decades. This update summarizes new insights from the last three years.

Recent Findings

The process of diagnosing PNES has shifted from the exclusion of epilepsy to one based on the recognition of typical clinical features. While the diagnosis cannot rely on any single feature in isolation, a range of semiological features characterising PNES are now recognised and a number of studies hint at the potential for machine learning and AI to improve the diagnostic process. Advances in data processing and analysis may also help to make sense of the heterogeneity of PNES populations demonstrated by recent studies focussing on aetiology and patient subgroups. It is now clear that PNES are associated with high rates of mental and physical comorbidities and premature death, highlighting that they are only one manifestation of a complex disorder extending beyond the nervous system and the seizures themselves.

Summary

PNES are now understood as a manifestation of dysfunction in interacting brain networks. This understanding provides an explanation for the psychopathological and semiological heterogeneity of PNES patient populations. New insights into medical comorbidities and increased rates of premature death call for more research into associated pathological processes outside the nervous system.

### Functional neurological disorder: practical management [^113rSTAF]. Neurotherapeutics (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Functional Neurological Disorder (FND) is one of the most common neurological disorders seen from childhood to the elderly, in almost all clinical settings, and by clinicians from different disciplines, especially neurologists. The last two decades have seen an improved understanding of this disorder that has brought a renewed clinical approach guided by increasingly available evidence. These advances allow clinicians to more comfortably diagnose and manage patients with FND in their pursuit of recovery. This article summarizes practical management highlights to guide clinicians who come across individuals with FND in their clinical practice.

FND is currently defined as a "clinical syndrome with genuinely experienced neurological symptoms which are distressing or impairing, and show dysfunction of the nervous system with variability in performance within a task or between tasks". FND is associated with high and rising healthcare utilization and costs, similar to other complex neurological disorders but with marked lag in research funding comparatively. In addition, there are a growing number of studies showing high rate of disability and distress with FND diagnosis as well as elevated morbidity and mortality especially in the seizure subtype, functional/dissociative seizures (F/DS), also known as psychogenic nonepileptic seizures. This is particularly concerning since FND is a challenging condition to recognize, diagnose, and treat. These challenges have led to the increased costs but suboptimal outcomes. In 2013, the DSM 5 update required FND (recognized within the DSM 5 manual as "conversion disorder" or "functional neurological symptom disorder") be diagnosed using positive "rule in" criteria, abandoning longstanding practice of ruling out all other possible causes, and helping to make some progress with the recognition of the disorder. There is a new dawn for FND with a rapidly growing interest in research into understanding how this disorder happens, educating clinicians and the public to how common it is, and in searching for new evidence-based treatments that can help the myriads of patients who suffer from it. This current perspective will provide a brief background and then focus on practical management of this common, distressing and debilitating disorder.

### Treating patients with psychogenic non-epileptic seizures [^112oR5yL]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2002). Low credibility.

While the diagnostic features of psychogenic non-epileptic seizures have been better characterized in recent years, comparatively little is written about management. This review provides guidance to clinicians involved in the treatment of patients with psychogenic non-epileptic seizures and generates ideas for future research. It summarizes the recent literature specifically dealing with the treatment of such seizures and draws on the wider psychiatric literature on effective treatments for patients with other medically unexplained symptoms.

### Psychogenic non-epileptic seizures in early Huntington's disease [^115gFZyD]. Practical Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Although psychogenic non-epileptic seizures are most frequent in women in their 20s and 30s, they can occur in anyone. There is a previous history of psychological trauma or psychiatric co-morbidities in approximately 70% of patients. Up to half of patients have a precipitating life event. The semiology of psychogenic non-epileptic seizures can resemble most types of epileptic seizures but some aspects may increase the clinical suspicion: triggering by psychological stress, long duration, fluctuating course, asynchronous movements, pelvic thrusting, forced eye closure, ictal crying, memory recall and signs of emotional distress.

The diagnostic gold standard is video EEG, with the absence of ictal electroencephalographic abnormalities before, during and after the attack. The use of this technique is obligatory to make a documented diagnosis based on the ILAE criteria. Nevertheless, it is possible to establish the diagnosis with a lower degree of certainty. A clinically established diagnosis should be made when a conventional ictal EEG detects no abnormalities and the semiology is compatible with psychogenic non-epileptic seizures; a normal interictal EEG and a clinically witnessed event or clinically reviewed video-recording of an event suffice to allow a probable diagnosis; and finally, at the lower end of diagnostic certainty, a possible diagnosis needs a normal interictal EEG and a witness or self-reported description of a compatible event.

These non-epileptic attacks can have adverse quality-of-life consequences and a high rate of recurrence. Thankfully, early and accurate recognition of psychogenic non-epileptic seizures improves the prognosis. The treatment plan should encompass discussing and explaining the diagnosis to the patient and carers, withdrawal of antiepileptic drugs with special attention to discontinuation syndromes, and psychiatric and/or psychological interventions.

Key points

Huntington's disease (HD) is a hereditary neurodegenerative condition caused by a cytosine–adenine–guanine repeat expansion, characterised by motor dysfunction, cognitive deterioration and psychiatric problems.
Epileptic seizures are a common feature of juvenile-onset HD.
Seizures are no more prevalent in adult-onset HD than in the general population, but anxiety phenomena are very common in HD and can produce dissociative phenomena that clinically mimic epileptic events.
Many patients experience functional neurological symptoms soon after manifesting a HD diagnosis.
Non-epileptic seizures should be managed with patient and carer education, withdrawal from antiepileptic drugs, and psychiatric and/or psychological interventions.

### Psychogenic nonepileptic "seizures" or "attacks"? It's not just semantics: attacks [^11355kgL]. Neurology (2010). Low credibility.

Since the phrase "psychogenic nonepileptic seizures" has been the term of choice, it has become clear that the word "seizure" here creates confusion. Beyond theoretical arguments, the confusion it creates is detrimental to patients' and families' understanding of the diagnosis, which in turn has a negative impact on treatment.

### Use of serum prolactin in diagnosing epileptic seizures: report of the therapeutics and technology assessment subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology [^114wELHm]. Neurology (2005). Medium credibility.

Epileptic versus psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (NES) — interpretive guidance: Using either relative or absolute PRL rise as the criterion of abnormality, the pooled data suggest that elevated serum PRL is specific for differentiating complex partial seizures (CPS) or generalized tonic–clonic (GTC) seizures from psychogenic NES. The clinical utility of serum PRL arises from the high positive predictive value of the assay for ES; in settings where GTC or CPS-like events are suspected to be psychogenic NES and "organic" imitators such as syncope have been excluded, an elevated serum PRL supports an epileptic etiology and can be clinically useful when video-EEG is not readily available.

### Incidence rates and characteristics of pediatric onset psychogenic nonepileptic seizures [^115x9m1z]. Pediatric Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Pediatric onset psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES) is a highly disabling disorder and potentially misdiagnosed as epilepsy. Still, knowledge regarding PNES in children and adolescents is limited and data on both incidence and characteristics are scarce. This study investigated the incidence rate (IR) and clinical characteristics of pediatric onset PNES, including possible differences when having comorbid epilepsy.

Methods

A population-based study of children and adolescents aged 5–17 years with an incident diagnosis of PNES in the Danish healthcare registries between 1996 and 2014. In total, 386 children and adolescents were included after assessment of diagnostic validity using medical record data.

Results

The IR increased during the study period with the maximum IR observed in 2014 (7.4 per 100,000 person-years). A history of both neurologic and psychiatric problems as well as negative life events was identified. Comorbid epilepsy was confirmed for 55 cases (14.2%) and was associated with intellectual disabilities, school support and prolonged delay in PNES diagnosis.

Conclusions

PNES are increasingly diagnosed in children and adolescents, and the clinical profile of both neurologic and psychiatric health problems underscores the need for collaborative pediatric and mental healthcare. These findings provide important information for future healthcare planning in this area.

Impact

This nationwide study is the first to report population-based incidence rates of pediatric onset PNES documenting markedly increasing incidence rates between 1996 and 2014. A history of both neurologic and psychiatric problems as well as negative life events was identified for pediatric onset PNES. Comorbid epileptic seizures were associated with intellectual disabilities, school support and prolonged delay in PNES diagnosis. The clinical profile of both neurologic and psychiatric health problems underscores the need for collaborative pediatric and mental healthcare. The increasing number of children and adolescents diagnosed with PNES is important information for future healthcare planning in this area.

Background

Psychogenic nonepileptic events (PNEE) are paroxysmal events that resemble epileptic seizures but are caused by psychological factors. Coordination of care has been recommended as one strategy to integrate care and improve outcomes. We aim to evaluate patient outcomes in a multidisciplinary pediatric psychogenic nonepileptic events clinic that includes care coordination.

Methods

All patients referred to the multidisciplinary psychogenic nonepileptic events clinic were entered into a prospective database. Follow-up calls were made by the clinic nurse at 1 and 3 months following the visit.

Results

A total of 101 unique patients were reviewed. Ninety-six appointments were scheduled, and 83 appointments were completed (86%). Social work identified barriers in 38 patients, and 76% of those assisted completed their appointment. At 1 month, two-thirds of families were reached, 50% were accepting of the diagnosis, and 70% had clinical improvement in events. By 3 months, 75% had clinical improvement, 76% were receiving mental health services, and 73% were accepting of the diagnosis; however, more had also returned to the emergency department. Families needing assistance from social work tended to have worse outcomes. Increase in acceptance was nearly statistically significant (P = 0.058) from 1 to 3 months; however, it was not so for clinical improvement in events (P = 0.623).

Conclusions

Implementation of a multidisciplinary team with care coordination allowed for follow-up for children and adolescents with psychogenic nonepileptic events and mitigation of barriers to care and can improve clinical outcomes. After being seen in our clinic, many families had accepted the diagnosis, most of the patients reached had event improvement and were successfully linked with counseling at the 1- and 3-month follow-ups.

### Functional seizures [^1145fNf8]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

Functional or psychogenic seizures have proved a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge for centuries. Functional seizures can look and feel similar to epileptic seizures but are instead a common and highly disabling form of functional neurologic disorder, or conversion disorder. Consistent with the biopsychosocial model of mental illness, functional seizures are caused by biological, psychological, and social factors unrelated to epileptic discharges. People with functional seizures do not consciously fake their symptoms. Functional seizures can be differentiated from epileptic seizures through the clinical history, features of the seizures themselves, and electroencephalography findings. Psychotherapy is effective in treating functional seizures.

### Psychogenic non-epileptic seizures in children [^114UhZ87]. Current Problems in Pediatric and Adolescent Health Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Psychogenic Non-Epileptic Seizures (PNES) are a relatively common condition in children. While their clinical presentation resembles epileptic seizures, the underlying cause for PNES involves a multitude of bio-psychosocial factors. Patients may be misdiagnosed with epilepsy and subjected to unnecessary treatments, often delaying the diagnosis for years. A strong understanding of its symptomatology is essential for diagnosis of PNES. Successful management depends on effective teamwork that involves the neurologist as well as mental health professionals. This paper reviews the various aspects of PNES in children with emphasis on the clinical presentation, diagnosis as well as the underlying psychological basis and treatment.

### Mortality in a cohort of patients with psychogenic non-epileptic seizures [^113nS2y3]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2012). Low credibility.

Some evidence suggests that psychogenic non-epileptic seizures (PNES) are associated with increased mortality. The authors obtained death certificate information in a cohort of 260 patients who presented with PNES between 1999 and 2004. The follow-up period averaged 7.92 years, during which 17 patients died, 12/17 were under the age of 75 years, giving a premature (< 75 years) mortality rate of 0.58%, compared with a Scottish mortality rate for the 40–75 years age group of 0.41% per year. The main predictor of death was the patient age at presentation of PNES. There was no correlation with withdrawal of anticonvulsant medication, and death certificate information provided no evidence to suggest that the deaths were related to the seizure disorder. The population had a high mean deprivation rank, providing a possible explanation for a modest increase in premature death rate.

### Increased suicide attempt risk in people with epilepsy in the presence of concurrent psychogenic nonepileptic seizures [^112k45Nc]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

Our study design allowed us to disentangle the individual effect of PNES and that of epileptic seizure disorder on the risk of attempting suicide in people with concurrent diagnosis. While this group was at significantly increased risk when compared with people with epilepsy alone, the risk was similar to that of people with PNES alone. This pattern suggests that for people with a concurrent diagnosis, the added risk of attempting suicide is mainly due to the presence of PNES and related clinical profile. We hypothesise that an ability to dissociate might enable engagement with suicidal behaviour, or alternatively that a suicide attempt might be a severe reaction to the burden of living with dissociative symptoms. Concurrent diagnosis should therefore not to be regarded simply as a coexistence of different seizure types; but rather that it is associated with a different risk profile, approximating to that of people with PNES alone.

No previous study has examined whether in the presence of concurrent PNES, people with epilepsy are at increased suicide attempt risk. Previous evidence, however, highlights that in epilepsy, the highest suicide risk occurs in the presence of comorbid psychiatric disease. Our study corroborates these findings and for the first time estimates the magnitude of risk specific to the concurrent presence of PNES. Given the scarcity of studies examining people with concurrent diagnosis, our findings represent a substantial advancement towards a better understanding of the psychopathology and risk profile associated to this condition.

Our observation that people with PNES alone and people with concurrent diagnosis are at comparable suicide attempt risk align with those of a small-sampled study reporting no difference in the number of suicide attempts between these two populations. Our results reinforce these findings with evidence from a large and extensive cohort. Additionally, by including a comparison with a large sample of people with epilepsy alone, we estimate the contribution of different seizure types on suicide attempt risk.

### Psychogenic non-epileptic seizures 2020: the enhanced role of the neurologist… [^114KNPvJ]. Epilepsy Currents (2020). Medium credibility.

The neurologist must oversee the discontinuation of ASD, unless the psychotropic properties of the drug is yielding a therapeutic effect for comorbid psychiatric or pain disorders or unless the patient is suspected or known to have comorbid epileptic seizures, which may be in remission with the ASDs. The neurologist is also needed for the diagnostic evaluation of other conversion disorders that may be concurrent or may develop after the diagnosis of PNES and hence avoid costly workups and hospitalizations. Furthermore, the frequent comorbid headaches and migraines and sleep disorders will require the neurologist's intervention. Finally, since many patients may continue to experience their events, it is likely that they will be taken to an ER at one time or another. Having a neurologist that the ER physician can call and that can explain the nature of the events will save unnecessary administration of ASDs and admissions to the hospital or to the ICU.

In summary, 17 years later, we have seen significant advances in our understanding of the complex and pleomorphic nature of PNES and of treatment strategies that we can offer patients. The role of the neurologist in the treatment process is fundamental so hopefully the attitude of " diagnose and adios " will become a thing of the past!

### Evaluation of a new body-focused group therapy versus a guided self-help group program for adults with psychogenic non-epileptic seizures (PNES): a pilot randomized controlled feasibility study [^114tj7bn]. Journal of Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Another difference to earlier studies is that we used an active control group. First, we believe that using an active control group is a strength of our study because it tests for the so-called nonspecific treatment factors. Several studies have shown that common (nonspecific) factors cause an average placebo response of around 40% in psychotherapy. This condition is comparable to drug RCT studies under similar conditions when primary outcome efficacy measures are patient-reported outcomes. These nonspecific effects might play a role in the very high significant effects of previously evaluated treatment programs for PNES patients.

Gold et al. describe a framework in which they offer an algorithm that helps construct clinical psychiatric studies. Considering this framework for our study condition, an active and nonspecifically effective control group, especially for patients with a high risk inherent to the condition, is recommended, no matter if there are already effective treatment options. Therefore, we chose the study design with an active control group mainly for ethical reasons, which is in line with the decision framework from Gold et al. Generally, it can be discussed whether SHGs offer a cost-effective and widely available alternative to treat PNES patients. SHGs could be most valuable in rural areas where trained therapists are less available. These findings are also consistent with those of previous studies in other areas of behavioural health, pointing towards self-help approaches as a veritable alternative to therapist-delivered treatment.

There are several limitations to our study: The small sample size, mainly due to high drop out rates, led to insufficient power for small effects to reach statistical significance.

Nevertheless, our dropout rate is comparable to the dropout rates in previous studies with the same design and disease. However, we had a remarkably high dropout rate (study withdrawal) before the intervention groups started. From initially 67 screened patients, only 42 started the intervention in one of the two study arms. This high withdrawal rate can be partly explained by the non-blinded design, which triggered a 'nocebo'-effect in patients randomized in the control group arm. Six patients did not show up to the control group intervention because of the disappointment of being randomized to the 'wrong group'. For further studies, we recommend an improved communication, for example, neutral labelling of the study groups at recruitment, starting from a position of equipoise of the two treatment arms. This might help to reduce early withdrawal.

### How many patients with psychogenic nonepileptic seizures also have epilepsy? [^113bkTUx]. Neurology (2001). Low credibility.

The proportion of patients with psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES) who also have epilepsy has been reported to vary from 10% to over 50%. The authors reviewed all 32 patients diagnosed with PNES in our EEG-video monitoring unit over a period of 1 year, and only 3 (9.4%) had interictal epileptiform discharges to support a coexisting diagnosis of epilepsy. Thus, the authors believe that only a small proportion of patients with PNES have coexisting epilepsy.

### Increased suicide attempt risk in people with epilepsy in the presence of concurrent psychogenic nonepileptic seizures [^115XoV6m]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To test the hypothesis that people with concurrent diagnosis of epilepsy and psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES) are at increased risk of attempting suicide as compared to people with epilepsy or PNES alone. To report on suicide rates.

Methods

Retrospective cohort study from the UK largest tertiary mental health care provider, with linked nationwide admission and mortality data from the Hospital Episode Statistics and Office for National Statistics. Participants were 2460 people with a primary or secondary diagnosis of epilepsy, PNES or concurrent epilepsy and PNES attending between 1 January 2007 and 18 June 2021. The primary outcome was a first hospital admission for suicide attempt (International Classification of Diseases, version 10 X60–X84).

Results

9% of participants had at least one suicide attempt-related hospital admission. For people with concurrent diagnosis of epilepsy and PNES, the odds for suicide attempt-related admissions were 2.52 times the odds of people with epilepsy alone (OR 0.40; 95% CI 0.21 to 0.79; p = 0.01). Odds were comparable between people with concurrent diagnosis and people with PNES alone (OR 0.75; 95% CI 0.41 to 1.48; p = 0.40). Post hoc analyses revealed that the odds of people with PNES alone were 1.93 times the odds of people with epilepsy alone (OR 0.52; 95% CI 0.38 to 0.70; p < 0.001).

Conclusions

People with concurrent diagnosis of epilepsy and PNES or PNES alone have significantly increased odds of hospitalisation due to suicide attempt as compared to people with epilepsy alone (152% and 93% increase, respectively). These findings have direct implications for the clinical management of suicide risk in people with epilepsy.

### Clinical classification of psychogenic non-epileptic seizures based on video-EEG analysis and automatic clustering [^117RLrBq]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Psychogenic non-epileptic seizures (PNES) or attacks consist of paroxysmal behavioural changes that resemble an epileptic seizure but are not associated with electrophysiological epileptic changes. They are caused by a psychopathological process and are primarily diagnosed on history and video-EEG. Clinical presentation comprises a wide range of symptoms and signs, which are individually neither totally specific nor sensitive, making positive diagnosis of PNES difficult. Consequently, PNES are often misdiagnosed as epilepsy. The aim of this study was to identify homogeneous groups of PNES based on specific combinations of clinical signs with a view to improving timely diagnosis.

Methods

The authors first retrospectively analysed 22 clinical signs of 145 PNES recorded by video-EEG in 52 patients and then conducted a multiple correspondence analysis and hierarchical cluster analysis.

Results

Five clusters of signs were identified and named according to their main clinical features: dystonic attack with primitive gestural activity (31.6%); pauci-kinetic attack with preserved responsiveness (23.4%); pseudosyncope (16.9%); hyperkinetic prolonged attack with hyperventilation and auras (11.7%); axial dystonic prolonged attack (16.4%). When several attacks were recorded in the same patient, they were automatically classified in the same subtype in 61.5% of patients.

Conclusion

This study proposes an objective clinical classification of PNES based on automatic clustering of clinical signs observed on video-EEG. It also suggests that PNES are stereotyped in the same patient. Application of these findings could help provide an objective diagnosis of patients with PNES.

### Mortality in patients with psychogenic non-epileptic seizures a population-based cohort study [^116Ly41N]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To compare mortality, comorbidities and causes of death in people with psychogenic non-epileptic seizures (PNES), epilepsy and the general population.

Methods

Using linkage of multiple Swedish national registers, we identified individuals with incident diagnosis of PNES, epilepsy and conversion disorder with motor symptoms or deficits, and 10 controls for each. Main outcome was all-cause mortality. Causes of death were categorised into non-natural (eg, suicide, injuries) and natural. Conditional Cox regression models were used to estimate HRs and 95% CIs for mortality. HRs were adjusted for socioeconomic factors and psychiatric comorbidities.

Results

Included were 885 individuals with PNES, 50663 with epilepsy and 1057 with conversion disorder and motor symptoms or deficits. We found 32 (3.6%) deaths among individuals with PNES, compared with 46 (0.5%) deaths in controls, giving an adjusted HR of 5.5 (95% CI 2.8 to 10.8). Patients with epilepsy had a 6.7 times higher risk of death (95%CI 6.4 to 7.0) compared with individuals without epilepsy. The association between conversion disorder with motor symptoms or deficits was non-significant after adjusting for psychiatric comorbidities. PNES carried a higher risk of natural (HR 8.1, 95%CI 4.0 to 16.4) and non-natural causes of death (HR 15.3, 95%CI 3.0 to 78.6). Suicide ranked high in patients with PNES (18.8%) and conversion disorder with motor symptoms and deficits. The association between PNES diagnosis and all-cause mortality varied with age and time since diagnosis.

Conclusion

Like epilepsy, PNES carries a higher than expected risk of both natural and non-natural causes of death. The high proportion of suicides requires further investigation.

### Increased suicide attempt risk in people with epilepsy in the presence of concurrent psychogenic nonepileptic seizures [^116XYQvr]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Suicide results in over 800 000 deaths per year globally, and it represents the second most common cause of death in people between 15 and 29 years, and the fifth in people aged 30–49 years. The WHO calls for suicide prevention to become a global and national health priority, including implementation of strategies at national level as well as identification of high-risk groups for targeted psychosocial interventions.

Epilepsy is one of the most common neurological disorders worldwide. It is estimated that in people with epilepsy, suicide is at least three times more frequent than in the general population. An accurate assessment of suicide risk in people with epilepsy is therefore a clinical and national health priority.

A recent meta-analysis reports that a substantial proportion (12%) of people with epilepsy have comorbid psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES). These are episodes of abrupt paroxysmal change in behaviour or consciousness in the absence of the neuro-electrophysiological changes that accompany epileptic seizures. A diagnosis of a dissociative disorder such as PNES is associated with higher rates of suicide attempts. A previous suicide attempt has been identified as the single most important risk factor for suicide. Recognition and management of psychiatric disorders including PNES in people with epilepsy should therefore play a crucial role in suicide prevention.

Limited data and lack of community-level studies on people with concurrent diagnosis of epilepsy and PNESpose considerable challenges towards accurate clinical risk assessment.

To our knowledge, this is the first study quantifying the risk imposed by concurrent PNES on suicide attempts in people with epilepsy. We interrogated a large and extensive patient cohort (n = 2460) to test the hypothesis that people with a concurrent diagnosis of epilepsy and PNES are at increased risk of attempting suicide as compared with people with epilepsy alone or PNES alone. Through this hypothesis testing study, we aimed to disentangle the individual effect of PNES and that of epileptic seizure disorder on the risk of attempting suicide. We provide evidence that can be directly and intuitively applied to risk assessment of patient groups in clinical practice.

### Psychogenic non-epileptic seizures in early Huntington's disease [^111xjQTo]. Practical Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

The patient consulted his general practitioner who referred him to us concerning that the attacks may be epileptic seizures. Two months after the first attack, we reviewed him; his neurological examination between attacks was compatible with HD (see online supplementary video 1b) with no unexpected focal signs. Routine and sleep-deprived electroencephalograms (EEGs) and MR neuroimaging were normal.

We diagnosed probable psychogenic non-epileptic seizures according to the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) criteriaon the basis of the presence of predisposing factors, compatible semiology assessed by an experienced neurologist in a video recording, exclusion of an explanatory medical cause and negative investigations, including interictal EEG. We informed him of the diagnosis and the risk factors that had contributed to its development, counselled on de-escalation techniques and gave citalopram for low mood and anxiety. The episodes ceased and 24 months later, he remains event-free.

Psychiatric Comorbidity and Traumatic Brain Injury Attribution in Patients With Psychogenic Nonepileptic or Epileptic Seizures: A Multicenter Study of US Veterans

Salinsky M, Rutecki P, Parko K, Goy E, Storzbach D, O'Neil M, Binder L, Joos S. Epilepsia. 2018. Epub ahead of print.

Objective: To determine the frequency and severity of psychiatric disorders and attribution of seizures to traumatic brain injury (TBI) in veterans with verified psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES) versus epileptic seizures (ES). Methods: We studied 333 consecutive admissions to the monitoring units of 3 Veterans Administration epilepsy centers. All patients underwent continuous video-electroencephalographic recording to define definite PNES or ES. Evaluations included the Structured Clinical Interview for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) Checklist, Beck Depression Inventory II, and Patient Seizure Etiology Questionnaire. Interviews and questionnaires were completed prior to final seizure type diagnosis and patient debriefing. The primary outcome measure was a comparison of Axis I psychiatric diagnoses in patients diagnosed with PNES versus ES. Results: A total of 81 patients were diagnosed with PNES and 70 with ES. Posttraumatic stress disorder was the most frequent Axis I diagnosis in veterans with PNES (64% vs 13% of those with ES; P < .001). Posttraumatic stress disorder was common regardless of deployment to a war theater or combat exposure. Mood, substance abuse, and anxiety disorders were also more common in the PNES group. Traumatic brain injury was cited as a likely cause of seizures by 47% of veterans with PNES versus 25% of those with ES (P = 0.01). Posttraumatic stress disorder and attribution of seizures to TBI were found in 30% of veterans with PNES versus 3% of those with ES (P < .001). Significance: In veterans referred for inpatient seizure evaluation, PTSD was strongly associated with a diagnosis of PNES versus ES. The association of PNES with PTSD, attribution of seizures to TBI, or both, may prompt early consideration of PNES.

### Clinical correlation advised: measuring functional connectivity in PNES [^1111jTrA]. Epilepsy Currents (2020). Medium credibility.

Commentary

Nearly a third of people with epilepsy have seizures that are refractory to medical management. Physicians and researchers working in the field of epilepsy have dedicated their entire careers to improve this statistic through advances in epilepsy surgery, developments of new therapeutics and cutting edge diagnostics, and better understanding of the long-term consequences of uncontrolled seizures. The ultimate goal is to improve the care and quality of our patients' lives but also to answer several "whys" — why does epilepsy occur, why are some patients refractory to therapy, why do comorbidities arise? Unfortunately, the level of curiosity and research efforts is not equal across all seizure types.

Psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES) are an example of a disorder that has not attracted sufficient attention from the scientific community. Psychogenic nonepileptic seizures are paroxysmal events that involve changes in consciousness, tone, or motor activity and that occur in the absence of epileptiform abnormality on electroencephalography. Psychogenic nonepileptic seizures have incidence rates between 4 and 7.4/100 000, varying by age-group and geographic location, among other variables. Although this may pale in comparison to the annual cumulative incidence of epilepsy at 68/100 000, PNES are likely vastly underdiagnosed; they have a mortality ratio 2.5 times the general population, comparable to drug resistant epilepsy, and nearly 70% of patients with PNES continue to have seizures despite therapy. Thus, while the incidence of PNES may be lower than epilepsy, the adverse impact is not. To date, we have failed to understand this condition adequately enough to improve treatment and outcomes, but why? The diagnosis and management of PNES has occupied a wasteland between the fields of psychiatry and neurology for centuries. For neurologists, the diagnosis lacks a signature biomarker; thus, we excel at describing what PNES is not on electroencephalogram (EEG) and less what it is. For psychiatrists, PNES does not fit nicely within boundaries created by criteria in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. That uncertainty leaves the diagnosis and best treatment plans in doubt. Two things are apparent. First, psychiatrists and neurologists will need to collaborate to improve the diagnosis and management of PNES and our patients will be better because of that collaboration. Second, we must understand why PNES occur to provide widespread legitimacy to the condition and a target for diagnosis and management.

### Can semiology predict psychogenic nonepileptic seizures? A prospective study [^116DdFbH]. Annals of Neurology (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

Reducing health and economic burdens from diagnostic delay of psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES) requires prompt referral for video electroencephalography (VEEG) monitoring, the diagnostic gold standard. Practitioners make VEEG referrals when semiology suggests PNES, although few semiological signs are supported by well-designed studies, and most VEEG studies neglect to concurrently measure how accurately seizure witnesses can ascertain semiology. In this study, we estimate the value of eyewitness-reported and video-documented semiology for predicting PNES, and we measure accuracy of eyewitness reports.

Methods

We prospectively interviewed eyewitnesses of seizures in patients referred for VEEG monitoring, to inquire about 48 putative PNES and ES signs. Multiple, EEG-blinded, epileptologists independently evaluated seizure videos and documented the presence/absence of signs. We used generalized estimating equations to identify reliable video-documented PNES and ES signs, and we compared eyewitness reports with video findings to assess how accurately signs are reported. We used logistic regression to determine whether eyewitness reports could predict VEEG-ascertained seizure type.

Results

We analyzed 120 seizures (36 PNES, 84 ES) from 35 consecutive subjects. Of 45 video-documented signs, only 3 PNES signs ("preserved awareness", "eye flutter", and "bystanders can intensify or alleviate") and 3 ES signs ("abrupt onset", "eye-opening/widening", and postictal "confusion/sleep") were significant and reliable indicators of seizure type. Eyewitness reports of these 6 signs were inaccurate and not statistically different from guessing. Consequentially, eyewitness reports of signs did not predict VEEG-ascertained diagnosis. We validated our findings in a second, prospective cohort of 36 consecutive subjects.

Interpretation

We identified 6 semiological signs that reliably distinguish PNES and ES, and found that eyewitness reports of these signs are unreliable. We offer suggestions to improve the accuracy of eyewitness reports.

### A disciplined approach to treatment of psychogenic nonepileptic seizures [^113b4oLJ]. Epilepsy Currents (2022). Medium credibility.

Commentary

One wonders what Jean Martin Charcot would have thought about a multidisciplinary psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES) clinic. He likely would have approved the idea of multiple people involved in clinical problem solving, but there may have been some difficulty understanding the word "multidisciplinary". Medical specialties were not so defined in the late 1800s, except for the distinction between a physician and a surgeon, the latter being more of a practical technician than an intellectual diagnostician. Of course, disciplines and specializations have exploded in the last 150 years, though whether this enhances a multidisciplinary approach or not is still up for debate. What is clear is that in Charcot's day, thinking differently and incorporating multiple viewpoints was at least implicitly "de rigueur". The very idea of PNES was the offshoot of pushing through the constraints of conventional wisdom. The novel insight was powerful enough to launch the whole new field of psychoanalysis, piloted by Sigmund Freud, and stemming from his witnessing the neurologist, Charcot, demonstrating PNES induction.

### Psychogenic nonepileptic (functional) seizures: significance of family history and model learning [^112KcPrT]. Psychiatry Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

If a positive family history of seizures plays a significant role that contributes to the risk for developing psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES) by means of model learning, one would expect that patients with PNES with a family history of seizures show a different semiology than those without such a history. We investigated whether the above hypothesis is valid.

Methods

In this retrospective study, all patients with PNES, who were diagnosed at Shiraz Comprehensive Epilepsy Center at Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Iran, from 2008 until 2019, were investigated. Demographic and clinical characteristics were compared between patients with a positive family history of seizures and those without such a history RESULTS: During the study period, 274 patients with PNES-only had the inclusion criteria. Seventy-seven (28%) patients had a positive family history of seizures and 197 (72%) patients did not have such a history. There were no significant demographic or clinical differences between the two groups.

Conclusion

It seems that a positive family history of seizures and model learning does not play a significant role in the development of PNES. Investigators should explore other potentially significant contributors and risk factors for developing PNES in future studies.

### Misdiagnosis of prolonged psychogenic non-epileptic seizures as status epilepticus: epidemiology and associated risks [^114Y3Xoi]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Status epilepticus is thought to cause irreversible harm after more than 30 min of ongoing convulsions, so early aggressive treatment is recommended by most guidelines. Within minutes, benzodiazepines should be administered as first-line medication, with high-dose antiepileptic drugs and intubation as second-line and third-line treatment in cases of refractory seizure activity. This compression of treatment timeframes has proven beneficial for the majority of patients with status epilepticus. However, this treatment imperative can come at the cost of diagnostic accuracy in emergencies.

The main differential to consider when assessing patients with suspected (convulsive) status epilepticus are dissociative seizures, also known as functional or psychogenic non-epileptic seizures (PNES). Prolonged PNES (pPNES) are reported by 78% of patients with PNES and lead to emergency admissions to the intensive care unit (ICU) in 18%–27% of patients. Acute pharmacological treatment is not indicated as pPNES are usually self-limited and do not respond to medication (beyond the occasional placebo response or deep sedation). pPNES generate no direct secondary physical harm to patients and should be treated with verbal and behavioural interventions only.

As clinical differentiation between epileptic seizures and PNES requires specific semiological expertise, and the treatment imperative for presumed status epilepticus demands almost immediate decision-making, misdiagnosis is common in emergency settings and pPNES are often treated mistakenly with non-indicated medication. Retrospective reviews suggest that patients with misdiagnosed pPNES often receive benzodiazepines (at even higher doses than patients with status epilepticus)and frequently require endotracheal intubation as a consequence. Of note, pPNES are the foremost determinant of healthcare utilisation costs in patients with PNES.

A systematic look at treatment trials for status epilepticus presenting to emergency services (table 1, online supplemental figure 1) reveals that misdiagnosis of pPNES as status epilepticus occurs in various settings and at all levels of treatment: prehospital and in the emergency department; and first-line and second-line therapy. Misdiagnosis is common in both adult and paediatric populations and in both paramedic-led and physician-led emergency services. Remarkably, none of the listed trials had specific procedures in place to recognise and exclude pPNES from study enrolment, nor did they specify protocols for treatment reallocation in cases of misdiagnosis.

### Furthering the evidence of comorbid psychiatric disorders in pediatric patients with psychogenic nonepileptic seizures [^117DUKUy]. Epilepsy Currents (2021). Medium credibility.

Commentary

Psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES) are a conversion disorder per DSM 5 and a dissociative disorder per ICD10. Whichever way one might characterize PNES, it is a disorder of paroxysmal motor, nonmotor or behavioral alteration without an EEG correlate to explain the change. As PNES is one of the most critical neuropsychiatric conditions associated with epilepsy, an International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) Taskforce on PNES was established. Between 2011 and 2017, there have been several publications spearheaded by the PNES Taskforce summarizing diagnosis of PNESand management approaches. Another ILAE publication has focused on identifying and closing the diagnosis and treatment gaps in PNES, and several opportunities for research were highlighted. One of the key gaps that was identified was the lack of epidemiologic data on the incidence and prevalence of PNES in children. Another was the lack of population-based studies on the psychiatric comorbidities of PNES in various groups: specifically, children and older adults.

In the article that is the subject of this commentary, Hansen et alperformed a nationwide register-based cohort study using the Danish Health registry. Patients of ages 5–17 years with an incident diagnosis of PNES between 1996 and 2014 were studied. 384 children with PNES were identified, and the researchers recruited thrice the number of patients with epilepsy (ES) and 5 times the number of healthy controls (HC) for comparison. The main aims were to describe the spectrum of psychiatric diagnoses before diagnosis of PNES (prevalent psychiatric diagnoses) and in the 2 years following PNES diagnosis (incident psychiatric diagnoses).

How do Findings of this Population Study Tie in into Diagnosis and Treatment Gaps as Identified by ILAE in Pediatric PNES?

Epidemiology of Childhood PNES

Although not directly mentioned in the present study, the same cohort of patients was used to determine the rising incidence of PNES between 1996 to 2014. As against published incidence rates of 1.4–4.9/100,000/ year, this group has identified an increasing incidence of PNES with maximum incidence of 7.4/100,000 person years in 2014.

### Psychogenic non-epileptic seizures 2020: the enhanced role of the neurologist… [^111wvams]. Epilepsy Currents (2020). Medium credibility.

In the last 15 years, there have been significant advances in the treatment of PNES, with the establishment of cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) with or without a selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressant. - For example, one randomized trial compared the efficacy of CBT, CBT + sertraline, sertraline alone, and treatment as usual. Cognitive behavior therapy with and without sertraline yielded a significant reduction in events, psychiatric symptoms, and improved global functioning. Yet, complete freedom from events was achieved in less than 50% of patients.

These data clearly indicate that there is more to PNES than the actual events. The complexity of the psychiatric clinical manifestations coupled with the frequent comorbid medical and neurologic disorders illustrate the challenge that clinicians face. Ideally, an integrated multidisciplinary team composed of a neurologist, a psychiatrist and a psychologist is necessary to develop a comprehensive diagnostic evaluation and treatment plan for PNES. So, neurologists who consider their role to be limited to " diagnose and adios " must accept that their role just begins with the establishment and the presentation of the diagnosis. Indeed, their first aim is to ensure that patients and family members alike have clearly understood that they do not have epileptic seizures, that these events do not cause brain damage, and therefore, that taking the patient to the ED should be avoided. Patients must know that they have a neurologist taking care of them and whom they can call when the events recur (and they will recur!). This will minimize or avoid their visits to the ER, which poses the higher morbidity and mortality risks, as they may be restarted with high doses of ASDs and worse, admitted (unnecessarily) to an intensive care unit (ICU) (reported in 30% to 50% of patients.

### Psychological and behavioural treatments for adults with non-epileptic attack disorder [^113GmM35]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Psychogenic non-epileptic seizures, also known as non-epileptic attack disorder (NEAD), have the outward appearance of epilepsy in the absence of physiological or electroencephalographic correlates. Non-epileptic seizures can occur in isolation or in combination with epileptic seizures. The development and maintenance of non-epileptic seizures has been well documented and there is a growing literature on the treatment of non-epileptic seizures which includes non-psychological (including anti-anxiety and antidepressant pharmacological treatment) and psychological therapies (including cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), hypnotherapy and paradoxical therapy). Various treatment methodologies have been tried with variable success. The purpose of this Cochrane review was to establish the evidence base for the treatment of non-epileptic seizures with behavioural and psychological therapies only.

Objectives

To assess whether behavioural or psychological treatments for non-epileptic seizures or NEAD result in a reduction in the frequency of seizures or improvement in quality of life, or both, and whether any treatment is significantly more effective than others.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Epilepsy Group's Specialised Register (4 February 2013), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2013, Issue 1) (January 2013), MEDLINE (1946 to 4 February 2013), PsycINFO (4 February 2013) and SCOPUS (4 February 2013). No language restrictions were imposed. We checked the reference lists of retrieved studies for additional reports of relevant studies

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and before and after controlled and non-controlled studies were eligible for inclusion. Studies were required to assess one or more types of behavioural or psychological interventions, or both, for the treatment of non-epileptic seizures. Studies of childhood non-epileptic seizures were excluded from our review.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors (JM, JP) independently assessed the trials for inclusion and extracted data. Outcomes included reduction in seizure frequency and improvements in quality of life.

Main Results

Twelve studies, with a total of 343 participants, met our inclusion criteria (four RCTs and eight before and after non-controlled studies). Of the four RCTs, one examined patients with non-epileptic seizures and three had a mixed diagnosis (pseudoseizures, conversion disorder and somatisation disorder). Most of the non-randomised studies used non-epileptic seizure patients exclusively. Overall, five studies examined the effectiveness of psychotherapy, three examined CBT, two investigated hypnosis, one assessed paradoxical intention and one had a mixed intervention design. We classified two included studies as low risk of bias, one as unclear and nine as high risk of bias. Meta-analysis could not be undertaken due to the heterogeneity of design and interventions. Most included studies reported improved outcomes for the intervention under investigation. One RCT investigating the effectiveness of CBT in this patient group found a significant reduction in seizure frequency compared to controls (P < 0.001).

Authors' Conclusions

There is little reliable evidence to support the use of any treatment, including CBT, in the treatment of non-epileptic seizures. Further randomised controlled trials of CBT and other interventions are needed.

### Psychogenic nonepileptic seizures [^113SpYE2]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review summarizes the recent studies assessing patients with psychogenic nonepileptic seizures and developments in treatment.

Recent Findings

The misdiagnosis of nonepileptic seizure is costly to patients, the healthcare system, and to society. Patients with nonepileptic seizures are prescribed antiepileptic drugs that do not treat nonepileptic seizures, have multiple laboratory tests performed, and may not receive the necessary mental healthcare that could benefit them. The first step in nonepileptic seizure treatment is proper diagnosis. Video electroencephalography remains the gold standard for nonepileptic seizure diagnosis. Certain seizure types, such as frontal lobe seizures, may mimic nonepileptic seizure semiology. Bedside observations may augment video electroencephalography to establish nonepileptic seizure diagnosis. The methodology in nonepileptic seizure treatment trials is examined, describing the challenges in conducting clinical trials with patients with overlapping neurologic and psychiatric disorders. Finally, realizing that nonepileptic seizures are in a spectrum of somatoform disorders, diagnostic literature is reviewed in other conversion disorders.

Summary

Nonepileptic seizure patients remain one of the most challenging populations to diagnose and treat in medical practice. Clinical findings and laboratory advances exist that more clearly establish the diagnosis of nonepileptic seizures. With the appropriate diagnosis, neurologists and mental health providers are better equipped to treat the underlying causes of nonepileptic seizures.

### Closing the major gap in PNES research: finding a home for a borderland disorder [^112NBca4]. Epilepsy Currents (2014). Low credibility.

Psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES) are events commonly encountered by primary care physicians, neurologists, pediatricians, and emergency medicine physicians in their practices, yet there continues to be significant variability in the way they are evaluated, diagnosed, and treated. Lack of understanding this condition and limited data on long-term outcome from current treatment paradigms have resulted in an environment with iatrogenic injury, morbidity, and significant costs to the patient and healthcare system. This article will review the current state of research addressing PNES treatment both in the adult and pediatric populations.

### Increased suicide attempt risk in people with epilepsy in the presence of concurrent psychogenic nonepileptic seizures [^111yy9HE]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

This study shows that people with concurrent diagnosis of epilepsy and PNES and people with PNES alone are at significantly increased risk of being admitted to hospital due to a suicide attempt as compared with patients with epilepsy alone (152% and 93% increase, respectively). These findings have direct implications for clinical management of suicide risk for people with epilepsy.

It is essential to investigate cases where there is a suspicion for coexisting seizure types, as a concurrent diagnosis of epilepsy and PNES is associated with a different risk profile and a significantly increased risk of hospitalisation due to suicide attempt. People with concurrent diagnosis of epilepsy and PNES are a high-risk category that should be target of enhanced risk monitoring and preventive psychosocial interventions.

### Benzodiazepine receipt in adults with psychogenic non-epileptic seizures in the USA [^1125dMqr]. BMJ Neurology Open (2024). High credibility.

The high prevalence of co-occurring psychiatric disorders in the PNES cohort may mean these individuals experience anxiolytic and/or antidepressant benefits from BZDs. Poor quality sleep and anxiety are common problems in people with PNES. Historically, BZDs were commonly prescribed as a front-line long-term therapy for anxiety disorders and insomnia in the general population; while recent literature has raised concerns about the long-term risks of BZD treatment outweighing short-term mental health benefits, there is limited data to guide clinical practice on the use of BZDs to treat anxiety and sleep problems specifically in people with PNES. While a study of BZD prescribing in the immediate post-PNES period showed that BZD treatment did not reliably terminate seizure activity among people misdiagnosed with status epilepticus, there remains a dearth of studies investigating the use of BZDs for prophylactic treatment or acute management of PNES. Overall the risk/benefit ratio for both short-term and long-term use of BZDs in PNES remains poorly understood.

### A disciplined approach to treatment of psychogenic nonepileptic seizures [^112NVeem]. Epilepsy Currents (2022). Medium credibility.

Patients and/or families were no more accepting of documented events than they were with "unproven" events. Furthermore, the outcomes did not depend upon having a "proven" diagnosis. This finding represents a fascinating conundrum. It implies that patients can engage in treatment despite not being confident of the diagnosis. Although in the study, acceptance of the PNES diagnosis improved through time, it did not predict reduction in the frequency of PNES events.

However, what did predict improvement, regardless of the establishment or acceptance of a PNES diagnosis, was rapid placement in psychotherapy within 30 days of the referral to the multidisciplinary program. Patients who were engaged in counseling within 30 days were more likely to have positive outcomes regardless of other factors, including acceptance of the diagnosis.

Perhaps that is the real value of a multidisciplinary program. A multidisciplinary team does not just mean multiple specialties; it means a consistent message and understanding of purpose. During the initial appointment in this program, patients and families heard a clear message from both a neurologist and a psychologist that the working diagnosis of PNES was being made and what that meant. More important than definitively establishing why or how it happens is instead, "what will be done next". Ultimately, Fredwall and colleagues have shown that a crucial part of the treatment for pediatric PNES is for multiple clinicians to have the discipline to deliver a consistent message and to just start the treatment in the first place.

### Do patients whose psychogenic non-epileptic seizures resolve', replace' them with other medically unexplained symptoms? Medically unexplained symptoms arising after a diagnosis of psychogenic non-epileptic seizures [^113ue7jp]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2011). Low credibility.

Background

In clinical practice, it is sometimes observed that patients in whom psychogenic non-epileptic seizures (PNES) cease, develop another medically unexplained symptom (MUS).

Methods

In order to determine how many patients develop new MUS post diagnosis and whether patients whose attacks cease are more likely to do so, new MUS were recorded 6–12 months after the diagnosis of PNES in 187 consecutive patients.

Results

Compared with baseline, the overall proportion of patients with MUS increased slightly, from 70.1% to 76.5%, with 44/187 patients (23.5%) developing new MUS. There were no significant differences between attack free and non-attack free patients. Binary logistic regression analysis showed that predictors of new MUS diverged between attack free and non-attack free patients. Among patients continuing to have attacks, those with previous health related psychological trauma were 18.00 times more likely to develop new MUS (p < 0.0005). In patients who became attack free, patients drawing disability benefits were 5.04 times more likely to have new MUS (p = 0.011).

Conclusions

The results suggest that almost 25% of patients develop new MUS following a diagnosis of PNES, although most of those have MUS pre-diagnosis. Patients with a history of health related psychological trauma whose attacks continue after diagnosis are at particularly high risk of developing new MUS. The data do not support the hypothesis that PNES that resolve are likely to be 'replaced' by other MUS.

### Conversion disorder as psychogenic nonepileptic seizures in suspected cancer: a case report [^111wb49W]. General Hospital Psychiatry (2014). Low credibility.

Psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES), a form of conversion disorder, are paroxysmal episodes resembling epilepsy while lacking electrographic correlation. The phenomenon has rarely been reported in elderly patients and has not been associated with a new-onset medical diagnosis. We present the case of an 81-year-old female with no past psychiatric or traumatic history who developed PNES within the context of a new, suspected cancer. To our knowledge, this is the first such reported case of a suspected cancer (or otherwise medical) diagnosis contributing directly and temporally to the development of PNES. Discussion of involved psychosocial variables follows the vignette, and a brief review of relevant literature is offered.

### Pediatric psychogenic nonepileptic seizures: a concise review [^115jQMq9]. Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Psychogenic nonepileptic seizures is a complicated biopsychosocial disorder with significant morbidity and high cost in children's social, emotional, family, and academic functioning as well as health care service utilization. Misdiagnosis and diagnostic delay, resulting from both lack of access to approved standards for diagnosing and service providers comfortable with diagnosing and treating this disorder, impact prognosis. Treatment in close proximity to symptom onset is thought to provide the best chance for remission.

### Guidelines for specialized epilepsy centers: executive summary of the report of the national association of epilepsy centers guideline panel [^113KaZEq]. Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Medication Management

ASM management is required for nearly all patients with epilepsy. Nonadherence with ASM is associated with increased morbidity, mortality, and higher health care–associated costs. Using a multidisciplinary team with pharmacologic expertise to provide medication counseling and to monitor for side effects can improve caregiver and patient adherence to ASM therapy. Centers should also provide resources to help patients navigate financial barriers to medication adherence.

Care Coordination

Children and adults with epilepsy often have additional social, educational, and/or complex medical needs. Optimal management requires cooperation among medical providers, therapy and education specialists, school personnel, and social workers. Care coordinators play an integral role in organizing and facilitating care for patients with high resource needs and improve family and care team satisfaction, clinical efficiencies, and patient outcomes.

Adolescents have unique needs in the transition period from pediatric to adult care. The American Academy of Pediatrics has advocated for the standardization of early transition education and coordinated care among patients with complex, chronic health conditions, such as epilepsy. National and international task forces have developed epilepsy-specific transition recommendations.

Psychogenic Nonepileptic Events

Psychogenic nonepileptic seizures or psychogenic nonepileptic events (PNEEs), also called functional seizures, are a relatively common psychiatric disorder that presents challenges in diagnosis and treatment and often coexists with epilepsy. VEEG monitoring is the gold standard for establishing the diagnosis of PNEE which accounts for approximately 15%–20% of patients referred to an EMU. Anxiety and depression may contribute to PNEE symptoms. Correct diagnosis and treatment requires psychological evaluation and psychotherapy and improves quality of life. Epilepsy centers play a key role in the diagnosis of PNEE, disambiguating epileptic seizures from nonepileptic events and facilitating referral to mental health providers for treatment. Centers should remain involved in the care of patients with PNEE following the initial diagnosis, to advise mental health providers who may be concerned about possible epileptic seizures and, when necessary, to re-evaluate patients where epileptic and nonepileptic events may both be present.

Patients With Special Needs

Children with developmental disabilities are at increased risk for developing epilepsy and its associated comorbidities, and constitute a special population that requires special attention. They require frequent follow-up visits and multispecialty care and may exhibit behaviors that can — if not appropriately addressed — interfere with optimal neurologic evaluation and treatment. Epilepsy centers should consider the barriers to care faced by children with disabilities and develop a systematic approach to overcoming these obstacles.

### Management of psychogenic non-epileptic seizures: a multidisciplinary approach [^1118QcoE]. European Journal of Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

The International League against Epilepsy (ILAE) proposed a diagnostic scheme for psychogenic non-epileptic seizure (PNES). The debate on ethical aspects of the diagnostic procedures is ongoing, the treatment is not standardized and management might differ according to age group. The objective was to reach an expert and stakeholder consensus on PNES management. A board comprising adult and child neurologists, neuropsychologists, psychiatrists, pharmacologists, experts in forensic medicine and bioethics as well as patients' representatives was formed. The board chose five main topics regarding PNES: diagnosis; ethical issues; psychiatric comorbidities; psychological treatment; and pharmacological treatment. After a systematic review of the literature, the board met in a consensus conference in Catanzaro (Italy). Further consultations using a model of Delphi panel were held. The global level of evidence for all topics was low. Even though most questions were formulated separately for children/adolescents and adults, no major age-related differences emerged. The board established that the approach to PNES diagnosis should comply with ILAE recommendations. Seizure induction was considered ethical, preferring the least invasive techniques. The board recommended looking carefully for mood disturbances, personality disorders and psychic trauma in persons with PNES and considering cognitive-behavioural therapy as a first-line psychological approach and pharmacological treatment to manage comorbid conditions, namely anxiety and depression. Psychogenic non-epileptic seizure management should be multidisciplinary. High-quality long-term studies are needed to standardize PNES management.

### Risk factors for diagnostic delay in psychogenic nonepileptic seizures among children and adolescents [^115BBDgA]. Pediatric Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

This study aims to analyze a series of pediatric patients with psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES) to establish the diagnostic gap and possible risk factors for the delayed diagnosis in this age group.

Methods

We evaluated all children with PNES documented by video electroencephalography. None had a previous diagnosis of PNES. In total, we included 53 children (interquartile range: seven to 17 years; mean age 12.81 years [S.D. 3.15]; 60.4% girls) who underwent a protocol consisting of neurological and psychiatric interviews.

Results

The average time between seizure onset and referral was 17.76 months (interquartile range: 0.5 to 48 months; S.D. ± 12.62). Earlier age of onset correlated with a later diagnosis (P < 0.001). The late referral group also presented with a history of psychological abuse (P = 0.018).

Conclusion

Youth with PNES represent a diagnostic challenge. Identification of children at risk might lead to earlier diagnosis of PNES.

### Evaluation of a new body-focused group therapy versus a guided self-help group program for adults with psychogenic non-epileptic seizures (PNES): a pilot randomized controlled feasibility study [^114JrqNL]. Journal of Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The present study is the first to evaluate a symptom-specific treatment program for German patients with PNES in a randomized clinical trial design. It features a new therapeutic aspect by including body-focused therapy exercises next to well-established cognitive-behavioural treatment methods. Furthermore, it is the first study that compares the effects of psychotherapeutic treatment for PNES with an active control treatment (guided SHG).

Patients who participated in the CORDIS treatment program and SHG showed improved dissociation levels and reduced seizure severity after the respective intervention (ITT sample analysis). However, there was no significant difference in the efficacy between either of the interventions, but the effect size showed a small to medium effect. After the six-month follow-up testing, the CORDIS treatment was superior to the active control intervention regarding the outcome parameter 'seizure severity' (per protocol analysis). Our study adds evidence to the currently small spectrum of treatment options for PNES patients and points toward the notion that body focussed interventions may be effective in PNES.

According to Röhricht et al. body psychotherapy is characterized by the central guiding principle that the body remains the focus of the therapeutic work. This counts especially for diseases with body-focused symptomatology, as given in PNES. PNES patients might get irritated if therapists confront them directly with explanations concerning the psychological genesis of their disease. It can be confusing that the seizures in PNES are caused by psychological reasons because patients tend to experience them clearly as a body dysfunction. Therefore, CORDIS tries not to directly address psychological theoretical explanation models unless the patient brings them up. This theoretical approach in combination with repeated exercises helping to improve body perception might play a role in the positive long-term effects of our treatment program, as shown in other studies focusing on body psychotherapy for medically unexplained symptoms.

### Benzodiazepine receipt in adults with psychogenic non-epileptic seizures in the USA [^113GgAnm]. BMJ Neurology Open (2024). High credibility.

Despite these limitations, this study is strengthened by its use of multistate population-level data to evaluate potential unmet treatment needs among patients with PNES, a highly stigmatised and understudied condition. As evidence-based psychological and multimodal interventions are lacking, future research is needed to understand prescribing decisions and patient outcomes. Estimates on the use of BZD treatment in adults with PNES may help physicians and policymakers devise targeted intervention to address treatment gaps in people with PNES.

### Ictal heart rate differentiates epileptic from non-epileptic seizures [^116A5DS7]. Neurology (2002). Low credibility.

Video-EKG-EEG recordings of 67 epileptic seizures and 38 psychogenic nonepileptic seizures were reviewed. Ictal heart rate (HR) was higher during and after epileptic seizures for both convulsive and nonconvulsive spells (p < 0.01). When analyzing quiet staring spells separately, it was possible to identify which spells were epileptic in origin with a positive predictive value of 97% by using a cutoff of a ≥ 30% increase in HR over baseline. It was concluded that documenting an increase in HR during a spell of unresponsiveness usually can distinguish between epileptic and psychogenic causes.

### Psychiatric disorders in children and adolescents with psychogenic nonepileptic seizures [^113b3VnR]. Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

Knowledge regarding psychiatric disorders in children and adolescents with psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES) is limited. This study outlines the spectrum and risk of psychiatric disorders in childhood-onset PNES.

Methods

We performed a nationwide matched cohort study of children and adolescents with PNES 5 to 17 years of age at the time of diagnosis between January 1, 1996, and December 31, 2014. Two matched comparison groups were included: children and adolescents with epilepsy (ES) and children and adolescents without PNES or epilepsy, called healthy controls (HC). Outcomes were prevalent psychiatric disorders before index (i.e., date of diagnosis or corresponding date for HC) and incident psychiatric disorders 2 years after index. Relative risks (RRs) were calculated and adjusted for potential confounders.

Results

We included 384 children and adolescents with validated PNES, 1,152 with ES, and 1,920 HC. Among the cases of PNES, 153 (39.8%) had prevalent psychiatric disorders and 150 (39.1%) had incident psychiatric disorders. Compared to the ES and HC groups, children and adolescents with PNES had elevated risks of both prevalent psychiatric disorders (adjusted RR PNES/ES 1.87, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.59–2.21, adjusted RR PNES/HC 5.54, 95% CI 4.50–6.81) and incident psychiatric disorders (adjusted RR PNES/ES 2.33, 95% CI 1.92–2.83, adjusted RR PNES/HC 8.37, 95% CI 6.31–11.11). A wide spectrum of specific psychiatric disorders displayed elevated RRs.

Conclusions

Children and adolescents with PNES are at higher risk of a wide range of psychiatric disorders compared to children and adolescents with ES and HC. A careful psychiatric evaluation is warranted to optimize and individualize treatment.

### Psychogenic non-epileptic seizures 2020: the enhanced role of the neurologist… [^114jW6NM]. Epilepsy Currents (2020). Medium credibility.

Commentary on: Kanner AM. Psychogenic Nonepileptic Seizures Are Bad for Your Health. Epilepsy Curr. 2003;3(5):181–182. doi:

In 2003, I wrote a commentary in Epilepsy Currents on a study by Reuber et al that investigated the outcome of 164 adults with psychogenic non-epileptic seizures (PNES) 4 years after diagnosis. Their findings were rather disappointing, as 72% continued to experience persistent events and more than 50% were dependent on governmental aid. At that time, we lamented the disappointing state of treatment of PNES and neurologists' attitudes toward these events of " diagnose and adios! "

Clearly, neurologists' attitudes toward PNES are out of synch with the realities of this condition today. First, PNES are relatively frequent, as they account for 11% of convulsive events evaluated in emergency departments (ED), 8% to 12% of consultations in "new seizure" clinics and 30% of patients referred to epilepsy centers with a presumed diagnosis of intractable epilepsy. Their annual incidence has been estimated to range from 1.5 to 6.17/100.000. Psychogenic non-epileptic seizures are recognized throughout the world, but their prevalence in developing countries has yet to be established because of limitations in the access to diagnostic studies. Yet, even in developed countries (eg, United Kingdom), there is a significant delay of 5 years between the onset of the disorder and diagnosis.

There seems to be a growing interest in PNES, as to date, they have been the source of 1584 PubMed citations and 338 000 Google hits. In this commentary I review, the advances in our understanding of PNES since the 2003 commentary reassess the role of neurologists in their management.

The recognition of PNES as one of the conversion disorders (after years of resistance) by the American Psychiatric Association in their Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Fifth Edition (DSM-5) appears to have been a "major accomplishment". Yet, the inclusion of PNES in the DSM-5 was more a political gesture and an unavoidable acknowledgment of a condition that had been known to neurologists and mental health professional alike since the 19th century.

### Depression in epilepsy: a critical review from a clinical perspective [^114qJprV]. Nature Reviews: Neurology (2011). Medium credibility.

Depression is a serious and frequent comorbidity of epilepsy and other neurological conditions. Here, we review recent studies on the relationship between epilepsy and depression with regard to diagnostic criteria, epidemiology, etiology and treatment. Depression in epilepsy can be described in the general framework of the diathesis-stress model: chronic stress exposure owing to the 'burden of epilepsy' and learned helplessness due to the threat of recurrent seizures as unpredictable aversive events represent psychological risk factors for the development of depression. Epilepsy-related factors (for example, focus site or side) have shown little effect on mood. Nonepileptic individuals who are adversely affected by seizures (for example, parents of pediatric patients with epilepsy, and patients with psychogenic nonepileptic seizures) show increased levels of depression, similar to patients with epilepsy. However, seizures, subclinical hypersynchronous neural discharges and some antiepileptic drugs may cause acute states of depressive mood or depression on a purely neurobiological basis. Antidepressant drugs and psychotherapy have shown moderate efficacy in the treatment of depression comorbidity, but randomized controlled trials in patients with epilepsy are lacking, especially for drugs.

### Multicenter pilot treatment trial for psychogenic nonepileptic seizures: a randomized clinical trial [^117AK9TJ]. JAMA Psychiatry (2014). Medium credibility.

Importance

There is a paucity of controlled treatment trials for the treatment of conversion disorder, seizures type, also known as psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES). Psychogenic nonepileptic seizures, the most common conversion disorder, are as disabling as epilepsy and are not adequately addressed or treated by mental health clinicians.

Objective

To evaluate different PNES treatments compared with standard medical care (treatment as usual).

Design, Setting, and Participants

Pilot randomized clinical trial at 3 academic medical centers with mental health clinicians trained to administer psychotherapy or psychopharmacology to outpatients with PNES. Thirty-eight participants were randomized in a blocked schedule among 3 sites to 1 of 4 treatment arms and were followed up for 16 weeks between September 2008 and February 2012; 34 were included in the analysis.

Interventions

Medication (flexible-dose sertraline hydrochloride) only, cognitive behavioral therapy informed psychotherapy (CBT-ip) only, CBT-ip with medication (sertraline), or treatment as usual.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Seizure frequency was the primary outcome; psychosocial and functioning measures, including psychiatric symptoms, social interactions, quality of life, and global functioning, were secondary outcomes. Data were collected prospectively, weekly, and with baseline, week 2, midpoint (week 8), and exit (week 16) batteries. Within-group analyses for each arm were performed on primary (seizure frequency) and secondary outcomes from treatment-blinded raters using an intention-to-treat analysis.

Results

The psychotherapy (CBT-ip) arm showed a 51.4% seizure reduction (P = 0.01) and significant improvement from baseline in secondary measures including depression, anxiety, quality of life, and global functioning (P < .001). The combined arm (CBT-ip with sertraline) showed 59.3% seizure reduction (P = 0.008) and significant improvements in some secondary measures, including global functioning (P = 0.007). The sertraline-only arm did not show a reduction in seizures (P = 0.08). The treatment as usual group showed no significant seizure reduction or improvement in secondary outcome measures (P = 0.19).

Conclusions and Relevance

This pilot randomized clinical trial for PNES revealed significant seizure reduction and improved comorbid symptoms and global functioning with CBT-ip for PNES without and with sertraline. There were no improvements in the sertraline-only or treatment-as-usual arms. This study supports the use of manualized psychotherapy for PNES and successful training of mental health clinicians in the treatment. Future studies could assess larger-scale intervention dissemination.

### Does the primary literature provide support for clinical signs used to distinguish psychogenic nonepileptic seizures from epileptic seizures? [^111hNkiH]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2010). Low credibility.

Psychogenic non-epileptic seizures (PNES) represent a diagnostic challenge. When trying to distinguish between PNES and epileptic seizures (ES), clinicians rely on the presence or absence of several clinical signs. The purpose of this review is to establish the extent to which these signs are supported by primary data from the literature. A Medline search was used to identify primary studies that used video-EEG to define the presence or absence of different clinical signs in PNES and ES. The methodological quality of the studies was assessed using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS) tool. 34 studies matched the inclusion criteria. A specific sign was considered well supported by the data from the primary literature if we were able to identify at least two controlled studies demonstrating its usefulness and if the data from other studies were supportive. There is good evidence from the literature that long duration, occurrence from apparent sleep with EEG-verified wakefulness, fluctuating course, asynchronous movements, pelvic thrusting, side-to-side head or body movement, closed eyes during the episode, ictal crying, memory recall and absence of postictal confusion are signs that distinguish PNES from ES. Postictal stertorous breathing proved to distinguish convulsive PNES from generalised tonic clonic seizures (GTCS) and should be added to the list of useful clinical signs. The final clinical diagnosis should encompass all available data and should not rely on any single sign alone.

### Differentiating between nonepileptic and epileptic seizures [^114PkbeP]. Nature Reviews: Neurology (2011). Medium credibility.

Psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES) resemble epileptic seizures and are often misdiagnosed and mistreated as the latter. Occasionally, epileptic seizures are misdiagnosed and mistreated as PNES. 70% of PNES cases develop between the second and fourth decades of life, but this disease can also affect children and the elderly. At least 10% of patients with PNES have concurrent epileptic seizures or have had epileptic seizures before being diagnosed with PNES. Psychological stress exceeding an individual's coping capacity often precedes PNES. Clinicians can find differentiating between PNES and epileptic seizures challenging. Some clinical features can help distinguish PNES from epileptic seizures, but other features associated with PNES are nonspecific and occur during both types of seizures. Diagnostic errors often result from an overreliance on specific clinical features. Note that no single feature is pathognomonic for PNES. When typical seizures can be recorded, video-EEG is the diagnostic gold standard for PNES, and in such cases a diagnosis can be made with high accuracy. When video-EEG reveals no epileptiform activity before, during or after the ictus, thorough neurological and psychiatric histories can be used to confirm the diagnosis of PNES. In this article, we review the clinical features that can help clinicians differentiate between PNES and epileptic seizures.

Health Care Practitioners' Perceptions of Psychogenic Nonepileptic Seizures: A Systematic Review of Qualitative and Quantitative Studies

Rawlings GH, Reuber M. Epilepsia. 2018;59(6):1109–1123. doi: Epub 2018 May 11.

A recent systematic synthesis of qualitative research demonstrated that patients with psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES) often experience unsatisfactory encounters with health-care practitioners (HCPs). It is important to understand such interactions from the perspective of those responsible for delivering care. This systematic review aimed to examine the attitudes and perceptions of HCPs toward PNES. A systematic search of 3 databases (Web of Science, PubMed, and CINAHL) was conducted in November 2017. Studies from around the world published after 1997 using qualitative or quantitative methodologies were reviewed. An interpretative stance was taken to analyze the data utilizing a grounded theory approach. The quality of studies included was assessed using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool. Overall, 30 separate studies capturing the views of at least 3900 professionals were included. Five concepts emerged from the analysis: (1) HCPs' responses demonstrated uncertainty about many aspects of PNES, including diagnosis and treatment; (2) HCPs understood PNES in dualistic terms, perceiving the condition as largely associated with psychological factors; (3) patients with PNES were considered challenging and frustrating; (4) HCPs held mixed or contested views about who is responsible for treating patients with PNES; and (5) PNES was viewed as less severe or disabling than epilepsy and associated with a greater degree of volition. Although some HCPs have an excellent understanding of PNES, the views of many give rise to concern. The number of qualitative studies that directly ask HCPs about their perceptions of PNES is limited. Moreover, some professional groups (ie, mental health specialists) are underrepresented in current research. This study reveals a demand for additional training. However, effort is needed also to change the attitudes of some practitioners toward PNES.

### Children with pseudoseizures: psychiatric aspects and… [^115d5b2r]. AAFP (1999). Low credibility.

Pseudoseizures, sometimes known as psychogenic or hysterical seizures, resemble epileptic seizures but are not associated with abnormal cortical electrical discharges. This condition affects children as young as five years of age and is the underlying problem in up to 22 percent of adults who are referred to specialists for treatment of epilepsy. During the monitoring period, each patient experienced at least one pseudoseizure that was described by the family and patients as "typical. " EEG readings obtained during seizure activity were consistently normal, except in four children who had a previous and concurrent diagnosis of true epilepsy. After the diagnosis of pseudoseizure was confirmed, a pediatric neurologist immediately presented the results to the patients and family. Anticonvulsant medications were not resumed except in the four children with true epilepsy. All patients were also examined by a pediatric psychiatrist at this time to identify any underlying problems.

Thirty-four children with pseudoseizures were included in the study. Mean patient age was 14 years, and mean duration of pseudoseizures until video diagnosis was about 11 months. All patients had a diagnosis of conversion disorder according to the. Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders criteria. However, malingering, factitious disorder and factitious disorder by proxy were ruled out in all patients. Moderate to severe psychosocial stressors, such as severe family stress, sexual or physical abuse, and school failure, were identified in 31 patients. From this larger group, two principal subgroups were identified. Eleven patients had major mood disorders and, of these, seven had a history of sexual abuse. Eight patients experienced separation anxiety/school refusal but, in this group, psychosocial stressors were less severe. Patients in the latter subgroup also benefited from family counseling and, in some cases, medical therapy.

However, in most patients, pseudo-seizures tended to occur months or even years after a specific psychosocial stressor, such as physical or sexual abuse, or in the context of chronic family dysfunction. The authors conclude that all children and adolescents with suspected pseudoseizures should undergo video EEG and a detailed psychiatric evaluation. Most patients with pseudoseizures also have major mood disorders and severe psychosocial stressors. Specific stressors include parental divorce, death of a family member and sexual and physical abuse. Although it was not proved definitively in this study, the authors suggest that some children benefit from counseling or other mental health interventions, including medical therapy.

### Psychogenic seizures… [^1179yhWq]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Desai BT, Porter RJ, Penry JK. Psychogenic Seizures: A Study of 42 Attacks in Six Patients, With Intensive Monitoring. Arch Neurol. 1982; 39: 202–209. doi:
10. 1001/archneur.
1982. 00510160008002.
- Intractable complex partial seizures and seizures of unknown type were studied in 78 patients, six of whom were found to have psychogenic seizures. Evaluation by intensive monitoring included simultaneous six-hour telemetered EEG and videotape recordings and daily determination of plasma antiepileptic drug levels. Diagnosis was determined by assessment of four major criteria: deviation of seizures from characteristics of known seizure types, absence of epileptiform activity in the ictal EEG, absence of slowing in the postictal EEG, and relation of seizure frequency to decreasing plasma concentrations of antiepileptic drugs. No single criterion is sufficient for an unequivocal diagnosis of psychogenic seizures.

### Psychogenic seizures: a review and description of pitfalls in their acute diagnosis and management in the emergency department [^111s6GHB]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Patients with psychogenic (nonepileptic) seizures (PS) are frequently encountered by clinicians in the emergency medicine setting. Despite the tendency for these patients to seek frequent medical attention, the time between onset of symptoms and diagnosis is often more than 7 years. The cause of PS is multifactorial, but most patients are thought to have an underlying dissociative condition. The diagnostic evaluation in the emergency department is challenging and relies heavily on clinical suspicion, based on historical and physical features. Laboratory testing and therapeutic maneuvers are of limited utility; prolonged video electroencephalography is the diagnostic gold standard. Once the diagnosis has been secured, the mainstay of treatment involves addressing the underlying psychological distress.

### Mortality in patients with psychogenic nonepileptic seizures [^1143EYS4]. Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

To investigate the hypothesis that patients diagnosed with psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES) on video-EEG monitoring (VEM) have increased mortality by comparison to the general population.

Methods

This retrospective cohort study included patients evaluated in VEM units of 3 tertiary hospitals in Melbourne, Australia, between January 1, 1995, and December 31, 2015. Diagnosis was based on consensus opinion of experienced epileptologists and neuropsychiatrists at each hospital. Mortality was determined in patients diagnosed with PNES, epilepsy, or both conditions by linkage to the Australian National Death Index. Lifetime history of psychiatric disorders in PNES was determined from formal neuropsychiatric reports.

Results

A total of 5,508 patients underwent VEM. A total of 674 (12.2%) were diagnosed with PNES, 3064 (55.6%) with epilepsy, 175 (3.2%) with both conditions, and 1,595 (29.0%) received other diagnoses or had no diagnosis made. The standardized mortality ratio (SMR) of patients diagnosed with PNES was 2.5 (95% confidence interval [CI] 2.0–3.3). Those younger than 30 had an 8-fold higher risk of death (95% CI 3.4–19.8). Direct comparison revealed no significant difference in mortality rate between diagnostic groups. Among deaths in patients diagnosed with PNES (n = 55), external causes contributed 18%, with 20% of deaths in those younger than 50 years attributed to suicide, and "epilepsy" was recorded as the cause of death in 24%.

Conclusions

Patients diagnosed with PNES have a SMR 2.5 times above the general population, dying at a rate comparable to those with drug-resistant epilepsy. This emphasizes the importance of prompt diagnosis, identification of risk factors, and implementation of appropriate strategies to prevent potential avoidable deaths.

### Retrospective discrimination of PNES and epileptic seizure types using blood RNA signatures [^111Q9pEc]. Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Epilepsy affects more than 3 million people worldwide and is characterized by repeated unprovoked seizures associated with many causes. The differential diagnosis of seizures is based on patient history and clinical examination, and misdiagnosis is frequent. It is often challenging to determine retrospectively whether a patient has suffered a seizure or a non-seizure event. Of patients who report a previous seizure in an emergency room setting, 10–20% may have suffered a psychogenic non-epileptic spell (PNES). Video electro-encephalogram (vEEG) is the gold standard for diagnosis; however, it is only performed in specialized epilepsy centers prospectively, and has poor retrospective diagnostic accuracy.

Psychogenic non-epileptic spells (PNES) are recognized as a conversion disorder (DSM-V). Typically, a patient with PNES displays the behavioral signs of a seizure but does not have ictal epileptiform activity or post-ictal memory loss and confusion. Although vEEG monitoring might clarify diagnosis, vEEG is costly and not easily available outside of epilepsy centers. The misdiagnosis of PNES is a concern for two key reasons. First, while PNES is responsive to therapy, therapy delays (due to diagnostic delays) lead to lower response rates. Indeed, the typical delay for confirmation of PNES is estimated to be 7 years, causing considerable costs for both the patient and the health system. Second, delayed diagnosis leads to inappropriate medication with anti-epilepsy drugs (AED). Studies of patients with a vEEG-confirmed PNES diagnosis show that 80% of patients were taking anti-seizure medication. Therefore, a retrospective diagnostic test to distinguish epileptic seizure from PNES is needed.

Here, we describe our studies of blood gene expression changes in patients undergoing long-term vEEG monitoring in an Epilepsy Monitoring Unit. Our data show that post-seizure changes in blood transcriptome profiles may enable the retrospective analysis of seizure-like events.

### Psychogenic non-epileptic seizures in early Huntington's disease [^113cE5vX]. Practical Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Discussion

HD is a hereditary neurodegenerative condition caused by a cytosine–adenine–guanine (CAG) repeat expansion in the HTT gene on the short arm of chromosome 4, with consequent production and accumulation of mutant huntingtin protein, which causes neuronal dysfunction and death. It is clinically characterised by a triad of motor dysfunction with involuntary movements and loss of voluntary control, cognitive deterioration and psychiatric problems.

Seizures are common in juvenile-onset HDbut are no more prevalent in adult-onset HD than in the general population. However, neuropsychiatric symptoms are common in early HD and can involve several different complaints, including dissociative phenomena.

In our experience, many patients experience functional neurological symptoms soon after manifesting a HD diagnosis — most likely because of increased disease-related anxiety and the inevitable severe stress that accompanies such a diagnosis. In the general population, psychogenic non-epileptic seizures and psychogenic movement disorders are among the most frequent psychologically-mediated syndromes seen by neurologists, and this is also our experience in the HD clinic. It is often difficult to distinguish between psychogenic movement disorders and psychogenic non-epileptic seizures, since both share causative factors and clinical features; some authors classify both conditions under the same spectrum. In this particular case, the altered higher mental function and the complexity of the movements made psychogenic non-epileptic seizures more likely.

Psychogenic non-epileptic seizures or dissociative seizures occur in 10–20% of people diagnosed with epilepsy. They can be clinically similar to any kind of epileptic seizure but are of psychological origin rather than being caused by hypersynchronous discharges in the brain. Attacks that resemble complex partial seizures are a relatively rare manifestation of psychogenic non-epileptic seizures but, in our experience, patients with HD can report any kind of epilepsy-like attack. It remains to be seen whether complex partial seizure-like attacks are more common in this population. Psychogenic non-epileptic seizures are considered to be an abnormal coping mechanism in the spectrum of dissociation. Indeed, patients with this condition have stronger connectivity between brain areas associated with emotion (insula), executive (inferior frontal gyrus and parietal cortex) and movement control (precentral sulcus), a pattern also observed in conversion disorders.

### Epidemiology of functional seizures among adults treated at a university hospital [^114pJbFL]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Functional seizures (previously psychogenic nonepileptic seizures) are paroxysmal episodes that often include altered awareness or convulsions with presentation similar to epileptic seizures. The term functional seizure is favored because it (1) reduces stigma, (2) does not presuppose a specific etiology, and (3) fits with existing nosology of other functional neurological movement disorders. Functional seizures can be definitively distinguished from epileptic seizures based on video electroencephalogram (vEEG) recording of typical seizures, which are usually performed in an epilepsy monitoring unit. Underlying psychological factors are likely involved in the etiology of functional seizures. Once diagnosed, patients with functional seizures may be treated with various psychiatric therapeutic modalities, including cognitive behavioral therapy, but to date no medications are specifically approved for functional seizures. Functional seizures remains understudied, yet 20% to 30% of patients referred to epilepsy monitoring units are eventually diagnosed with functional seizures. Published studies include small sample sizes and limited epidemiological data. Given the challenging diagnosis, limited treatment options, and lack of awareness, there is a need for more research on functional seizures.

The prevalence of functional seizures is estimated at 2 to 33 cases per 100 000 people (0.002%-0.033%)and approximately 17% to 22% of patients with functional seizures have concurrent epilepsy. Patients with functional seizures have a higher rate of psychiatric disorders (eg, posttraumatic stress disorder [PTSD], anxiety, depression) than both the general population and patients with epilepsy (risk ratio, 1.30; 95% CI = 1.14–1.48). Sexual assault trauma is a known risk factor for functional seizures, and it is thought that sexual assault, which also occurs more frequently among female individuals, could explain part of the female bias (ie, 73% women) in functional seizures. Epilepsy is also associated with increased psychiatric comorbidity, as well as increased risk for cerebrovascular disease. Little is known about whether similar risk for cerebrovascular disease exists in patients with functional seizures.

### Are psychogenic non-epileptic seizures just another symptom of conversion disorder? [^11224evn]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Psychogenic non-epileptic seizures (PNES) are classified with other functional neurological symptoms as 'Conversion Disorder', but there are reasons to wonder whether this symptomatology constitutes a distinct entity.

Methods

We reviewed the literature comparing PNES with other functional neurological symptoms.

Results

We find eight studies that directly examined this question. Though all but one found significant differences-notably in presenting age, trauma history, and dissociation-they were divided on whether these differences represented an important distinction.

Conclusion

We argue that the aetiological and mechanistic distinctions they support, particularly when bolstered by additional data, give reason to sustain a separation between these conditions.

### Induction of psychogenic nonepileptic seizures without placebo [^116pUXQr]. Neurology (2000). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES) can only be made with EEG-video monitoring. The authors describe a provocative technique without placebo. Patients with a clinical suspicion for PNES underwent an activation procedure using suggestion, hyperventilation, and photic stimulation. Of 19 inductions performed, 16 (84%) were successful in inducing the habitual episode. The authors' technique had a sensitivity comparable to those using placebo (e.g., saline injection), but does not have disadvantages.

### Psychogenic non-epileptic seizures 2020: the enhanced role of the neurologist… [^116NX1ay]. Epilepsy Currents (2020). Medium credibility.

Studies performed in the last 2 decades have expanded our appreciation of the pleomorphic nature of PNES not only on the complex clinical manifestations of the psychiatric profile but also in their association with comorbid neurologic, cognitive, medical and sleep disorders. For example, a patient's psychiatric picture may meet diagnostic criteria for a mood and/or anxiety disorder associated with a post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and a dissociative disorder with or without a personality disorder (particularly, clusters B and C). Furthermore, PNES may be one of several conversion disorders affecting the same patient, as other functional motor and/or sensory symptoms can be often identified, concurrently, preceding or after the remission of PNES.

Cognitive difficulties are the source of a common complaint but often they may not be demonstrated in neuropsychological testing. They may be an expression of a comorbid mood disorder or may reflect iatrogenic effects of anti-seizure drugs (ASDs) and/or frequently used pain medication (see below), and in some patients, they may represent a functional cognitive disorder.

Chronic pain is very common, reported in more than 80% of patients, including fibromyalgia, low back, and cervical pain. Furthermore, intractable migraines and/or mixed headache disorders are very common neurologic comorbidities, having been reported in up to 60% of these patients. These pain disorders have resulted in a higher risk of opiate use and abuse, with some authors reporting opiate use in 14% to 32%.

Sleep disorders are also frequent comorbidities, having been identified in 30% of PNES patients, including obstructive sleep apnea, periodic limb movement disorders, and sleep disturbances associated with other comorbid psychiatric disorders such as early night insomnia and/or middle of the night awakening or nightmares which can be part of a comorbid mood and anxiety disorder and/or PTSD. Finally, epileptic seizures can occur in 5% to 40% of patients with PNES. The higher comorbid occurrence is significantly more likely to be identified in patients with intellectual disability and in children.

### Outcome in psychogenic nonepileptic seizures: 1 to 10-year follow-up in 164 patients [^117Q68ex]. Annals of Neurology (2003). Low credibility.

Our knowledge of longer term outcome in psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNESs) patients is limited; we know less still about factors predicting prognosis. This study was intended to describe outcome in a large cohort and to identify predictive clinical and psychological factors to generate new ideas for treatment. One hundred sixty-four adult patients with PNESs (66.7%) responded to outcome, personality, and psychosymptomatology questionnaires (Dimensional Assessment of Personality Pathology-Basic Questionnaire [DAPP-BQ], Dissociative Experiences Scale, and Screening Test for Somatoform Symptoms) a mean of 11.9 years after manifestation and 4.1 years after diagnosis of PNES. Additional clinical data were retrieved from hospital records. The responses showed that 71.2% of patients continued to have seizures and 56.4% were dependent on social security. Dependence increased with follow-up. Outcome was better in patients with greater educational attainments, younger onset and diagnosis, attacks with less dramatic features, fewer additional somatoform complaints, and lower dissociation scores. Better outcome was associated with lower scores of the higher order personality dimensions "inhibitedness", "emotional dysregulation", and "compulsivity" but not "dissocial behavior" (DAPP-BQ). Outcome in PNESs is poor but variable. Clinical and personality factors can be used to provide an individualized prognosis. By generating a patient-specific profile, they show particular maladaptive traits or tendencies that can identify goals for psychological therapy.

### Benzodiazepine receipt in adults with psychogenic non-epileptic seizures in the USA [^112WQrKS]. BMJ Neurology Open (2024). High credibility.

Background

A diagnosis of psychogenic non-epileptic seizures (PNES) is a stigmatised condition that frequently co-presents in people being evaluated for epileptic seizures (ES).PNES is difficult to differentiate from ES both clinically and via electroencephalogram. As a result, nearly one-third of patients referred to epilepsy care are suspected to have PNES by neurologists, with many concurrently or previously diagnosed with ES. The challenge of accurately diagnosing and treating PNES is underscored by the International League Against Epilepsy's consensus clinical practice statements ranking PNES as among the top three neuropsychiatric problems associated with epilepsy.

Because antiseizure drugs are not known to effectively treat PNES, there is concern that treating PNES as if it were ES may result in medically unnecessary diagnostic evaluations and acute care admissions, which contribute to a reduced quality of life in people with PNES. When considering the potential for iatrogenic harm in people with PNES, benzodiazepines (BZDs) merit particular concern. One chart review study found that BZD prescriptions were initiated in > 70% of PNES episodes. While BZDs are commonly used both acutely and chronically for the treatment of ES, BZD use is associated with an increased risk of respiratory depression, addiction, cognitive impairment, drug-related poisoning and falls, accidents and injuries. Studies have also found prescription pain medications such as opioids to be prevalent among people with PNES and ES, raising concerns for the co-prescribing of opioids and BZDs, a risk factor for overdose death. Finally, although BZDs are commonly used to treat psychiatric conditions that are prevalent in adults with PNES, they can also complicate the differential diagnosis associated with ES. BZD withdrawal has clinical sequelae that may lead to seizures as well as anxiety, depersonalisation, depersonalisation and other symptoms that can mimic both PNES and ES, which may potentially lead to people being misdiagnosed with PNES that is actually BZD withdrawal.

### Characteristics of children hospitalized for psychogenic nonepileptic seizures due to conversion disorder versus epilepsy [^117FfLZc]. Hospital Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives

Psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES) are a manifestation of conversion disorder among children but can be difficult to distinguish from epilepsy. We sought to identify characteristics that differentiate children with PNES from those with epilepsy.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective cohort study of children admitted with epilepsy or PNES to 45 children's hospitals from 2004 to 2014. Children with PNES (n = 399) versus those with epilepsy (n = 13241) were compared on demographic and clinical characteristics, testing, treatment, and health care use. Hierarchical multivariable logistic regression was used to identify characteristics associated with PNES diagnosis.

Results

Children with PNES were more likely to be female (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 2.3; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.8–3.0), older (aOR 3.8; 95% CI 2.7–5.3 for 14–16 years old), African American (aOR 2.0; 95% CI 1.5–2.7), and have diagnosis codes for psychiatric disorders (aOR 7.1; 95% CI 5.6–9.1) and pain (aOR 2.6; 95% CI 1.9–3.4). They were also more likely to be admitted in the fall (aOR 2.0; 95% CI 1.4–2.8) or spring (aOR 1.9; 95% CI 1.4–2.6) versus summer. Total adjusted hospitalization costs were greater for children with epilepsy ($4724, 95% CI $4413-$5057 vs $5326, 95% CI $5259-$5393; p = 0.001); length of stay was similar.

Conclusions

Demographic and clinical characteristics differed among children with PNES versus those with epilepsy, including significantly increased odds of psychiatric and pain diagnoses among children with PNES. To better inform treatment and prognostication for children with PNES, research is needed to understand reasons for these differences, seasonal admission patterns, and the relationship between PNES and other psychiatric disorders.

### Functional (psychogenic non-epileptic / dissociative) seizures: why and how? [^111sHUco]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

Functional seizures (FS) known also as psychogenic non-epileptic seizures or dissociative seizures, present with ictal semiological manifestations, along with various comorbid neurological and psychological disorders. Terminology inconsistencies and discrepancies in nomenclatures of FS may reflect limitations in understanding the neuropsychiatric intricacies of this disorder. Psychological and neurobiological processes of FS are incompletely understood. Nevertheless, important advances have been made on underlying neuropsychopathophysiological mechanisms of FS. These advances provide valuable information about the underlying mechanisms of mind-body interactions. From this perspective, this narrative review summarises recent studies about aetiopathogenesis of FS at two levels: possible risk factors (why) and different aetiopathogenic models of FS (how). We divided possible risk factors for FS into three categories, namely neurobiological, psychological and cognitive risk factors. We also presented different models of FS based on psychological and neuroanatomical understanding, multilevel models and integrative understanding of FS. This work should help professionals to better understand current views on the multifactorial mechanisms involved in the development of FS. Shedding light on the different FS profiles in terms of aetiopathogenesis will help guide how best to direct therapy, based on these different underlying mechanisms.

### Can treating patients with PNES lower the risk of sudden unexpected death? [^1141pJ4T]. Epilepsy Currents (2021). Medium credibility.

Commentary

Psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES), functional seizures, or dissociative seizures are all names in consideration to define a presentation of functional neurologic symptom disorder (FND) with seizures or attacks. The prevalence of PNES is reported to be 2 to 33 per 100 000but they represent about a third of patients with intractable seizures seen in epilepsy clinics and epilepsy units.

Although our understanding of the physiopathology of PNES is still in an infant state, over recent years neurologists, psychiatrists, and epileptologists alike have learned to recognize its presentation, risk factors, premorbid conditions, and triggering events. We started to recognize this condition, as well as other FND, as brain network integration disorders with a biologic basis and a common presentation.

Patients with PNES share multiple similarities with patients with epilepsy (PWE). Both groups have sudden, mostly unpredictable, episodes of loss of voluntary control of their actions often with altered awareness or responsiveness which severely impair their social functioning. These episodes often come with limitations on education and employment opportunities as well as driving restrictions. Both groups live with the impending threat of a seizure or attack at almost any time in their life and both are associated with increased risk of psychiatric comorbidities such as depression and anxiety.

As an epileptologist, my goals of treatment are also similar for PWE and persons with PNES. My patients and I work together, aiming to achieve complete control of all episodic events, identify and manage comorbid conditions, minimize medication side effects, improve quality of life, and support social and emotional life goals including education, employment, and emotional functioning to the best of our abilities.

### 2017 ACC / AHA / HRS guideline for the evaluation and management of patients with syncope: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on clinical practice guidelines and the Heart Rhythm Society [^117KcB8t]. Heart Rhythm (2017). Medium credibility.

Psychogenic pseudosyncope — definition and differentiation are outlined as a syndrome of apparent loss of consciousness occurring in the absence of impaired cerebral perfusion or function and is believed to be a conversion disorder, an external somatic manifestation or response to internal psychological stresses. It is an involuntary response and should not be confused with malingering or Munchausen syndrome, and psychogenic pseudosyncope and pseudoseizures may be the same condition. The clinical distinction between the two is based on whether prominent jerky muscle movements simulating seizure activity are reported by witnesses; in the absence of associated jerky movements, the patient is likely to be referred for evaluation of syncope.

Annual Course — Controversies in the Management of Difficult Epilepsies

Lara E. Jehi, MD

Caring for patients with epilepsy is both a science and an art. This statement has never been more accurate than today. Faced with an exponential growth in diagnostic technology and novel therapeutics, the variety of choices that we have to make have become much more complex. Yet, robust data on comparative effectiveness and for evidence-based decision making are lacking. This information deficit is at the root of the significant variation in our practices, and suboptimal patient care. Considering several current controversies in the management of difficult epilepsies, some challenges stand out.

First, the frequency and indications for some tests that are considered cornerstones of our epilepsy management remain highly variable and require balancing multiple factors, including the treatment goals of the patients, risks, alternatives, and cost. The indication for a video EEG study is a perfect example. This inpatient testing is warranted to confirm the diagnosis of epilepsy and rule out psychogenic nonepileptic seizures in patients who continue to have seizures despite 2 or more adequate and appropriate antiepileptic drug trials. Conversely, holding off the initiation of seizure medications until a diagnosis of epilepsy can be positively confirmed with video EEG is clearly inappropriate in patients at high risk of seizure related injuries, nocturnal convulsions with increased risk of sudden death in epilepsy, existing medical comorbidities (eg, ischemic heart disease; severe pulmonary dysfunction), severe ictal or postictal behavioral disturbance, and in resource-limited communities. Similarly, it is important to check the blood levels of seizure medications when changes in metabolism are expected (eg, pregnancy, dialysis) or in the context of suspected toxicity, but a routine practice of blood-level monitoring is a waste of time and resources.

### How variable are psychogenic nonepileptic seizures? A retrospective semiological study [^113tVYv7]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose

To classify patients with psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES) according to a recently proposed classification system and investigate the variability of PNES semiology.

Methods

We retrospectively investigated all patients with PNES admitted at the Jefferson Comprehensive Epilepsy Center from 2012 through 2016. We classified their seizures after retrospectively reviewing their recorded videos during their video-EEG monitoring admission and investigated the seizure variability. We extracted all the clinical data from their medical records. We also studied factors potentially associated with seizure variability.

Results

Forty nine patients were studied and 220 seizures were reviewed and classified. Mean number of seizures per patient was 4.5. Twenty seven (55%) patients had subjective seizures, 26 (53%) had generalized motor, 14 (29%) had akinetic and five (10%) had focal motor seizures. Twenty eight (57%) patients had only one seizure class, while 19 (39%) patients had two different seizure classes and two (4%) patients had three seizure classes. Among 28 patients with one seizure class, 14 (50%) patients had variable semiologies from one seizure to the other. Hence, 71.5% of the patients showed either inter- or intra-class variability, whereas seizures were stereotypical in 28.5%. No demographic or clinical factors were significantly associated with variability of PNES semiology.

Conclusion

Neither the stereotypy nor the variability of PNES can or should be used as a marker of the disease and to differentiate PNES from epilepsy. The variability of the episodes of PNES does not hinder an appropriate classification of these seizures.
