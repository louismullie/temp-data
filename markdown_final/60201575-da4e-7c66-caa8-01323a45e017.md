## Question

This question refers to the following information.
"The Government of the German Reich and The Government of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics desirous of strengthening the cause of peace between Germany and the U.S.S.R., and proceeding from the fundamental provisions of the Neutrality Agreement concluded in April, 1926 between Germany and the U.S.S.R., have reached the following Agreement:
Article I. Both High Contracting Parties obligate themselves to desist from any act of violence, any aggressive action, and any attack on each other, either individually or jointly with other Powers.
Article II. Should one of the High Contracting Parties become the object of belligerent action by a third Power, the other High Contracting Party shall in no manner lend its support to this third Power.
Article III. The Governments of the two High Contracting Parties shall in the future maintain continual contact with one another for the purpose of consultation in order to exchange information on problems affecting their common interests.
Article IV. Should disputes or conflicts arise between the High Contracting Parties shall participate in any grouping of Powers whatsoever that is directly or indirectly aimed at the other party.
Article V. Should disputes or conflicts arise between the High Contracting Parties over problems of one kind or another, both parties shall settle these disputes or conflicts exclusively through friendly exchange of opinion or, if necessary, through the establishment of arbitration commissions".
Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, 1939
This agreement allowed both nations involved to freely invade which country?

A. Denmark
B. Finland
C. France
D. Poland

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which country the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact allowed Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union to freely invade. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the historical context and timing of the pact. Then, I should verify the secret protocol and what it actually permitted. Next, I will map the subsequent invasions to the timeline. After that, I need to check the other options (Denmark, Finland, France) to ensure none of them fit the pact's terms. Finally, I will confirm the answer and briefly note the historical outcome.

> Let me first confirm the context and timing. The Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact was signed on August 23, 1939, just days before World War II began, and it included a public non-aggression agreement plus a secret protocol that divided Eastern Europe into German and Soviet spheres of influence, which is the key to answering this question [^notfound].

> Wait, let me verify the secret protocol's content. The confidential addendum explicitly carved up territories, assigning parts of Eastern Europe to each signatory and outlining mutual non-interference in each other's designated sphere; this is what enabled coordinated action rather than conflict between Germany and the USSR in the region [^notfound].

> I will now examine the timeline of invasions. On September 1, 1939, Germany invaded Poland from the west; shortly thereafter, on September 17, 1939, the Soviet Union invaded Poland from the east, precisely as foreseen by the secret protocol, which had cleared the way for both powers to occupy Polish territory without interference from the other [^notfound].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about the other options. Denmark was invaded by Germany in April 1940, Finland was attacked by the USSR in the Winter War beginning November 1939, and France was invaded by Germany in May 1940; none of these operations were covered by the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact's secret protocol, so they do not match the question's premise [^notfound].

> Let me reconsider the phrasing "allowed both nations… to freely invade". The pact did not literally grant permission in a legal sense, but the secret agreement effectively greenlit partition and non-interference, which in practice meant both Germany and the USSR could invade and occupy Poland without fear of conflict with each other, which is the intended meaning here [^notfound].

> Final answer: D. Poland.

---

The Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact included a **secret protocol** that divided Eastern Europe into German and Soviet spheres of influence, explicitly placing Poland within both spheres. This arrangement enabled **Germany to invade western Poland on September 1, 1939**, and the **Soviet Union to invade eastern Poland on September 17, 1939**, without interference from the other signatory. The pact therefore directly facilitated the joint invasion and partition of Poland, making **Poland the correct answer**.

---

## Historical context of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact

Signed on August 23, 1939, the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact was a non-aggression treaty between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union. It contained a **secret protocol** that divided Eastern Europe into spheres of influence, placing Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland within these spheres. Specifically, Poland was divided along the Narew, Vistula, and San rivers, with the western portion assigned to Germany and the eastern portion to the Soviet Union.

---

## The secret protocol and its implications

The secret protocol was the critical component enabling both nations to invade Poland without conflict. It explicitly stated that in the event of territorial and political rearrangements in Poland, the interests of both Germany and the Soviet Union would be considered, effectively **sanctioning the partition of Poland** between the two powers.

---

## Timeline of the invasion of Poland

- **September 1, 1939**: Germany invaded western Poland, initiating World War II.
- **September 17, 1939**: The Soviet Union invaded eastern Poland, fulfilling the secret protocol's provisions.
- **October 6, 1939**: Poland was completely occupied and partitioned between Germany and the Soviet Union.

## Analysis of answer choices

| **Answer choice** | **Historical accuracy** | **Explanation** |
|-|-|-|
| A. Denmark | Incorrect | Denmark was invaded by Germany in April 1940, unrelated to the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact. |
| B. Finland | Incorrect | Finland was invaded by the Soviet Union in November 1939, but the pact did not explicitly facilitate this invasion. |
| C. France | Incorrect | France was invaded by Germany in May 1940, unrelated to the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact. |
| D. Poland | Correct | The pact's secret protocol directly enabled the joint invasion and partition of Poland by Germany and the Soviet Union. |

---

## Conclusion

The Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact's secret protocol explicitly divided Poland into German and Soviet spheres of influence, enabling both nations to invade and partition the country in September 1939. Therefore, the correct answer is **D. Poland**.

### Presentation and treatment of Poland anomaly [^116Aj7aE]. Hand (2016). Low credibility.

Background: Poland anomaly is a sporadic, phenotypically variable congenital condition usually characterized by unilateral pectoral muscle agenesis and ipsilateral hand deformity. Methods: A comprehensive review of the medical literature on Poland anomaly was performed using a Medline search. Results: Poland anomaly is a sporadic, phenotypically variable congenital condition usually characterized by unilateral, simple syndactyly with ipsilateral limb hypoplasia and pectoralis muscle agenesis. Operative management of syndactyly in Poland anomaly is determined by the severity of hand involvement and the resulting anatomical dysfunction. Syndactyly reconstruction is recommended in all but the mildest cases because most patients with Poland anomaly have notable brachydactyly, and digital separation can improve functional length. Conclusions: Improved understanding the etiology and presentation of Poland anomaly can improve clinician recognition and management of this rare congenital condition.

### Poland's syndrome: current thoughts in the setting of a controversy [^11489r2T]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Poland's syndrome is a rare congenital disorder that is characterized by hypoplasia of the pectoralis muscles and ipsilateral webbing of the fingers. The name of this condition pays homage to Dr. Alfred Poland of Guy's Hospital, who in 1841 described a case of these two deformities during the autopsy of a 27-year-old convict. An exploration of the historical series reveals a clear progression of knowledge about this syndrome, accumulated by scientists across Europe and America. As such, the name "Poland's syndrome" stands as a point of contention to those who oppose the injudicious use of eponyms in medicine. An analysis of the relevant literature reveals a stepwise understanding of what has come to be known as Poland's syndrome.

### Pneumococcal 13-valent conjugate vaccine (Prevnar 13) [^113vu5Kn]. FDA (2018). Low credibility.

7.3 Antipyretics

A post-marketing clinical study conducted in Poland using a non-US vaccination schedule (2, 3, 4, and 12 months of age) evaluated the impact of prophylactic oral acetaminophen on antibody responses to Prevnar 13. The data show that 3 doses of acetaminophen (the first dose administered at the time of each vaccination and the subsequent doses at 6 to 8 hour intervals) reduced the antibody response to some serotypes following the third dose of Prevnar 13, compared with responses among infants who received antipyretics only as needed for treatment. Reduced antibody responses were not observed after the fourth dose of Prevnar 13 when acetaminophen was administered prophylactically.

7.4 Prior Vaccination with PPSV23

Prior receipt of PPSV23 within 1 year results in diminished immune responses to Prevnar 13 compared to PPSV23 naïve individuals [see Clinical Studies (14.3)].

### Colorectal cancer screening: recommendations for physicians and patients from the U.S. multi-society task force on colorectal cancer [^111toA9v]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

Approaches to screening — opportunistic versus programmatic — note that in the United States colorectal cancer screening usually results from an office-based interaction and is termed opportunistic; programmatic screening is a system-wide organized approach with potential advantages including systematic offers of screening, reduction of overscreening, superior monitoring of quality, and systematic follow-up; national programs in Europe and Australia use fecal occult blood testing and include screening colonoscopy in Germany and Poland; the United States has no national program, although several large healthcare plans offer programmatic screening, typically with a fecal immunochemical test (FIT); despite the potential advantages of programmatic screening, the United States has achieved CRC screening compliance at 60% with incidence reductions of 3% to 4% per year and 30% overall in the first decade of this century; the task force anticipates growth of programmatic screening but expects at least short-term continued reliance on opportunistic screening, and achieving compliance with tests that require short-interval repetition is more challenging in opportunistic settings.

### Tobacco industry interference with tobacco control policies in Poland: legal aspects and industry practices [^111MyZ6U]. Tobacco Control (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Poland is among the countries with the highest death rate due to cigarette smoking, with 74 000 Poles dying annually from tobacco use. Additionally, millions of Poles suffer disability due to smoking-related chronic diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (with over 2 million people suffering from this disease in Poland). These premature deaths and disability cause tremendous economic costs and constrain economic development potential.

Those deaths and suffering could be largely prevented, and the socioeconomic costs avoided, by introduction of tobacco control measures. In 2006, Poland ratified the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (WHO FCTC), but since then has had only moderate success in implementing its provisions. Poland's tobacco control law underwent revision in 2010 and 2011 to extend smoke-free areas and improve point-of-purchase regulation; however, the scope of the revision has been greatly reduced during the legislative process. Despite ratifying the WHO FCTC, many tobacco control regulations still do not meet its requirements. For example, Poland still has partial smoke-free lawsand incomplete advertisement, promotionand sponsorship bans. At the European Union (EU) level, Poland actively opposed tobacco control measures proposed during revision of the Tobacco Products Directive from 2010 to 2014.

Poland's limited progress in implementing tobacco control measures has been shaped by the tobacco industry's influence on government institutions. Poland, the second-largest cigarette producer in the EU, is an important player in the industry's battle against tobacco control policies on the continent. No regulation constrains the tobacco industry's lobbying in Poland (see online supplementary appendix 1 for a more legal background).

Evidence suggests that the tobacco industry works aggressively to prevent or delay progress in tobacco control policies. The industry uses the same tactics and arguments over time and across jurisdictions, including presenting highly misleading economic arguments, using corporate social responsibility to gain governments' favour, using litigation or threat of litigationand manipulating science. It also uses countries with weaker political processes to interfere with tobacco control policies in countries with stronger public policy standards. In 2012, the issue of the tobacco industry's interference was the theme of the WHO World No Tobacco Day.

### Classifying alcohol control policies enacted between 2000 and 2020 in Poland and the baltic countries to model potential impact [^114bZkgd]. Addiction (2023). Medium credibility.

Aims

The study's aim is to identify and classify the most important alcohol control policies in the Baltic countries (Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania) and Poland between 2000 and 2020.

Methods

Policy analysis of Baltic countries and Poland, predicting potential policy impact on alcohol consumption, all-cause mortality and alcohol-attributable hospitalizations was discussed.

Results

All Baltic countries implemented stringent availability restrictions on off-premises trading hours and different degrees of taxation increases to reduce the affordability of alcoholic beverages, as well as various degrees of bans on alcohol marketing. In contrast, Poland implemented few excise taxation increases or availability restrictions and, in fact, reduced stipulations on prior marketing bans.

Conclusions

This classification of alcohol control policies in the Baltic countries and Poland provides a basis for future modeling of the impact of implementing effective alcohol control policies (Baltic countries), as well as the effects of loosening such policies (Poland).

### Tobacco industry interference with tobacco control policies in Poland: legal aspects and industry practices [^111yQi9S]. Tobacco Control (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Since 2006, when Poland ratified the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC), there have been efforts to improve tobacco control regulation in the country. At the same time, at the European Union level, Poland took part in discussions over revision of the Tobacco Tax Directive and the Tobacco Products Directive. This study aims to explore the tobacco industry's tactics to interfere with the creation of those policies.

Methods

Analysis of 257 documents obtained through freedom of information request.

Results

We identified three means that the tobacco industry used to interfere with tobacco control policies: creating a positive attitude, expressing a will to be a part of the policymaking process, and exerting pressure. We found that those tactics have often been used unethically, with the industry providing the government with ready legislation proposals, overstating its contribution to the economy and the government revenues, misrepresenting the illicit cigarette problem and misusing scientific evidence. The industry also used legal threats, including use of bilateral trade agreements, against implementation of tobacco control measures. The companies lobbied together directly and through third parties, with the cigarette excise tax structure being the only area of disagreement among the companies. The industry also pushed the Polish government to challenge tobacco control policies in countries with stronger public policy standards, including UK display bans and the Australian plain-packaging law.

Conclusions

From an object of regulation, the tobacco industry in Poland became a partner with the government in legislative work. Implementation of provisions of Article 5.3 of the WHO FCTC could prevent further industry interference.

### Changing mortality patterns in east and west Germany and poland. II: short-term trends during transition and in the 1990s [^113FdvM9]. Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health (2000). Low credibility.

Objectives

To examine trends in life expectancy at birth and age and cause specific patterns of mortality in the former German Democratic Republic (GDR) and Poland during political transition and throughout the 1990s in both parts of Germany and in Poland.

Methods

Decomposition of life expectancy by age and cause of death. Changes in life expectancy during transition by cause of death were examined using data for 1988/89 and 1990/91 for the former GDR and Poland; examination of life expectancy changes after transition were based on 1992–97 data for Germany and 1991–96 data for Poland.

Results

In both the former GDR and Poland male life expectancy at birth declined by almost one year during transition, mainly attributable to rising death rates from external causes and circulatory diseases. Female life expectancy in Poland deteriorated by 0.3 years, largely attributable to increasing circulatory mortality among the old, while in East German female rising death rates in children and young adults were nearly outbalanced by declining circulatory mortality among those over 70. Between 1991/92 and 1996/97, male life expectancy at birth increased by 2.4 years in the former GDR, 1.2 years in old Federal Republic, and 2.0 years in Poland (women: 2.3, 0.9, and 1.2 years). In East Germany and Poland, the overall improvement was largely attributable to falling mortality among men aged 40–64, while those over 65 contributed the largest proportion to life expectancy gains in women. The change in deaths among men aged 15–39 accounted for 0.4 of a year to life expectancy at birth in East Germany and Poland, attributable largely to greater decreases from external causes. Among those over 40, absolute contributions to changing life expectancy were greater in the former GDR than in the other two entities in both sexes, largely attributable to circulatory diseases. A persisting East-west life expectancy gap in Germany of 2.1 years in men in 1997 was largely attributable to external causes, diseases of the digestive system and circulatory diseases. Higher death rates from circulatory diseases among the elderly largely explain the female life expectancy gap of approximately one year.

Conclusions

This study provides further insights into the health effects of political transition. Post-transition improvements in life expectancy and mortality have been much steeper in East Germany compared with Poland. Changes in dietary pattern and, in Germany, medical care may have been important factors in shaping post-transition mortality trends.

### Tobacco industry interference with tobacco control policies in Poland: legal aspects and industry practices [^1121ZSpp]. Tobacco Control (2016). Low credibility.

Using Poland to interfere with tobacco control policies in other countries

Poland is also another case where the industry tries to use a country with weaker political processes to interfere with tobacco control policies in countries with stronger public policy standards. Many less-developed countries already appear to be under the industry's influence. For example, Ukraine, Honduras, the Dominican Republic, Cuba and Indonesia initiated formal proceedings against Australia within the World Trade Organization. In Poland, which scores lower than most developed countries on the World Bank's government effectiveness index, the industry tried to push the government to oppose UK display bansas well as the Australian plain packaging law.

The industry has been successful in at least one of these attempts. After receiving a legal opinion on the Australian Tobacco Plain Packaging Bill from the tobacco industry, the Ministry of Economy thanked the industry and promised to actively pressure Australia through the EU structures to abandon implementation of plain packaging. This commitment was made by the government even though Australia has never been a major partner in Poland's cigarette trade, receiving only 0.02% (two of every 10 000) of Poland's exported cigarettes from 2006 to 2012.

The industry also had Polish support in the fight against the EU Tobacco Products Directive, with Poland being one of only four countries that in June 2013 opposed the EU Council's consensus on the revised Directive, and the only country that sued the Directive in the European Court of Justice. Poland is also the only country that within the EU structures critically commented about both the UK's and Ireland's introduction of plain packaging.

### Anaesthesia for chest wall reconstruction in a patient with Poland syndrome: CARE-compliant case report and literature review [^1127jSH6]. BMC Anesthesiology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Poland syndrome is a rare congenital disease, characterized by agenesis/hypoplasia of the pectoralis major muscle, usually associated with variable thoracic anomalies that needed chest wall reconstruction under general anesthesia. Anaesthetic management in Poland syndrome has scarcely been described.

Case Presentation

Here, we present our anaesthetic management of Nuss procedure for chest wall correction in a 5 years old patient with Poland syndrome. We also reviewed the reports of anaesthetic management of Poland syndrome by searching Pubmed, and summarize the perioperative procedures that may warrant a safe surgery.

Conclusions

Examinations before surgery, intraoperative monitoring, choice of general anesthetics and pain management after surgery should all be contemplated.

Spirometry reference values — GLI-2012 versus NHANES III comparability show similar airflow limitation rates and small quantitative differences. In large clinical populations from Australia and Poland, rates of airflow limitation (FEV1/FVC < LLN) were similar in men (GLI 34.5 vs NHANES III 33.3%) and women (GLI 27.9 vs NHANES III 25.4%), and in simulation across a broad range of age and height, FEV1 percent predicted differences were within ± 150 mL across a wide range of heights and ages, with larger differences at extremes of height in older individuals; Canadian equations were somewhat closer to GLI-2012, but differences among the three were minor and not likely to be clinically important.

### Multienvironment genomic prediction in tetraploid potato [^116RUWLC]. G3 (2024). Medium credibility.

Tuber weight (scenario 2)

Comparing the genetic correlations and heritabilities for tuber weight, we notice that some trials were quite different. Poland 2018 showed low genetic correlation with the other trials (Table 2 and Fig. 4), while Spain 2017 had a low heritability in comparison to the other trials (Table 1). These trials may be a potential source of noise to the multienvironment prediction model. Therefore, to test the impact of these trials, we looked at the prediction abilities using all trials, and compared it to the prediction abilities after removing Poland 2018 only and Spain 2017 only (Table 3).

Table 3.
Prediction abilities in scenario 2 for tuber weight when using all trials, removing Poland 2018 only, and removing Spain 2017 only, for all multienvironment models and traits.

For all models and environments, using all 6 environments gave higher prediction abilities than models that used 5 environments. For the ME model, it is clear that the information from these environments were useful and increased prediction ability but for the G×E models these differences were mostly negligible. Similarly, removing both these environments together did not improve prediction ability (results not shown).

To reverse perspectives, we look at prediction in Poland 2018 and how it may be affected by trials used in the prediction model. Referring to the estimated genetic correlations in Table 2 and the GGE biplot in Fig. 4, the 2018 trials in Netherlands and Spain are quite distant from the Poland trial of that year. Recall that in scenario 2 we are predicting new genotypes in 1 particular trial, using a model trained by the information from all 6 trials. For predicting tuber weight in the Poland 2018 trial, there are 2 trials that both have a low genetic correlation with Poland 2018. To have a closer look at how this impacts prediction ability, a similar comparison is done as seen previously, where predictions are made in Poland 2018 using all trials vs predictions made after both Spain and Netherlands 2018 are removed (Fig. 8).

### Nontoxigenic highly pathogenic clone of Corynebacterium diphtheriae, Poland, 2004–2012 [^112AP9nf]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Corynebacterium diphtheriae is the causative agent of diphtheria. Its toxin is considered the major virulence factor. Since introduction of vaccine against the diphtheria toxin in the 1940s, infections caused by toxigenic corynebacteria have been well controlled in industrialized countries that have high coverage rates of childhood vaccination with 3 doses of diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis vaccine. Nevertheless, emergence of nontoxigenic C. diphtheriae infections has been reported in some of these countries.

In line with other European countries, Poland routinely vaccinates against diphtheria (Technical Appendix). According to data from the World Health Organization, > 95% of children in Poland are fully vaccinated against diphtheria. The last diphtheria case was recorded there in 2000.

The absence of diphtheria during the past 13 years suggests that the high vaccination coverage rates in Poland protect against diphtheria. In 2004, the first case of sepsis caused by nontoxigenic C. diphtheriae was recorded. Other cases were recorded in 2006, and since 2007, several cases of C. diphtheriae invasive infections have been recorded every year (Table 1). In addition, local infections — usually wound infections — caused by nontoxigenic C. diphtheriae were recorded (Table 2). A total of 25 nontoxigenic C. diphtheriae infections were recorded in Poland in 2004–2012, of which 18 were invasive infections.

### Nontoxigenic Corynebacterium diphtheriae infections, Europe [^114dnup4]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

To the Editor: We read with interest the article by Dangel et al. analyzing nontoxigenic Corynebacterium diphtheriae infections in northern Germany during 2016–2017. Among the cases, 2 patients originated from Poland; each experienced an invasive disease, 1 endocarditis and 1 sepsis. Poland and Germany are neighboring countries. In Poland, we also observed an accumulation of nontoxigenic C. diphtheriae infections during 2016–2017. In both countries, most infections were caused by isolates belonging to sequence type (ST) 8 biotype gravis, which we previously suspected of having increased pathogenic properties.

ST8 has been causing infection in Poland since 2004 and was isolated in Russia before that. However, the first ST8 isolate was not obtained in northern Germany until 2015, suggesting spread of pathogenic ST8 from eastern to western Europe. Comparing epidemiologic data from Poland during 2012–2017, we confirmed 48 cases of nontoxigenic C. diphtheriae, increasing from 3 cases in 2012 to 20 in 2017. As seen in northern Germany, most affected patients in Poland were male (> 80%), and ≈30% of patients were homeless, alcohol addicted, or both. We did not identify HIV as a risk factor. We saw a sharp increase in cases during the time of the Dangel et al. report as well, from 10 cases in 2016 to 20 in 2017. Nevertheless, in Poland, 40% of isolates (19/48) during 2012–2017 were obtained from invasive infections, whereas in Germany only 9 isolates (≈12%) were obtained from cases with severe invasive complications. None of the cases in Poland were related epidemiologically.

We hypothesize that pathogenic ST8 could spread to other countries in Europe in a few years and that persistence of ST8 isolates in the population might be related to increases in the number of invasive infections. The scale of the problem of nontoxigenic C. diphtheriae infections in Europe remains unknown because only toxigenic infections are registered. Lack of registration leads to lack of prevention and, thus, to outbreak development and spread.

### Poland-Möbius syndrome: a case report implicating a novel mutation of the PLXND1 gene and literature review [^1114Gnng]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Möbius (Moebius) and Poland's syndromes are two rare congenital syndromes characterized by non-progressive bilateral (and often asymmetric) dysfunction of the 6 th and 7 th cranial nerves and hypoplasia of the pectoral muscles associated with chest wall and upper limb anomalies respectively. Manifest simultaneously as Poland-Möbius (Poland-Moebius) syndrome, debate continues as to whether this is a distinct nosological entity or represents phenotypic variation as part of a spectrum of disorders of rhomboencephalic development. Etiological hypotheses implicate both genetic and environmental factors. The PLXND1 gene codes for a protein expressed in the fetal central nervous system and vascular endothelium and is thus involved in embryonic neurogenesis and vasculogenesis. It is located at chromosome region 3q21-q22, a locus of interest for Möbius syndrome.

Case presentation

We present the first report of a patient with Poland-Möbius syndrome and a mutation in the PLXND1 gene. A child with Poland-Möbius syndrome and a maternally inherited missense variant (NM_015103.2:ex14:c.2890G > Ap.V964M) in the PLXND1 gene is described. In order to contextualize these findings, the literature was examined to identify other confirmed cases of Poland-Möbius syndrome for which genetic data were available. Fourteen additional cases of Poland-Möbius syndrome with genetic studies are described in the literature. None implicated the PLXND1 gene which has previously been implicated in isolated Möbius syndrome.

Conclusions

This report provides further evidence in support of a role for PLXND1 mutations in Möbius syndrome and reasserts the nosological link between Möbius and Poland's syndromes.

### Dextrocardia in patients with Poland syndrome: phenotypic characterization provides insight into the pathogenesis [^1137dXkr]. The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

Poland syndrome is a rare congenital anomaly characterized by complete or partial agenesis of the pectoralis major muscle variably associated with other thoracic malformations, upper limb malformations, or both. More than 20 patients with dextrocardia and left-sided Poland syndrome have been previously described. The association between these 2 rare anomalies suggests a causal relationship, but the etiopathogenetic mechanism has not been clarified yet. We studied the clinical correlation between these 2 anomalies, and we tried to elucidate whether dextrocardia or Poland syndrome comes first.

Methods

This is a multicentric multidisciplinary study conducted over the last 5 years. We identified 122 patients with Poland syndrome, and we investigated heart position through different imaging techniques. Logistic regression statistical analyses were carried out.

Results

We observed dextrocardia in 14 (11.5%) patients, which was never associated with situs inversus. All of them presented with left-sided Poland syndrome and partial agenesis of 2 or more ribs. Conversely, all patients with Poland syndrome with partial agenesis of 2 or more ribs presented with dextrocardia, whereas dextrocardia was never associated with partial agenesis of a single rib. Three patients with dextrocardia presented with simple congenital heart defects.

Conclusions

These findings suggest that mechanical factors during embryonic life could explain the strong association between left-sided Poland syndrome and dextrocardia. According to this hypothesis, partial agenesis of 2 or more ribs is needed to displace the heart toward the right side. The peculiar features of dextrocardia when associated with Poland syndrome (neither associated with situs inversus nor complex intracardiac anomalies) support our hypothesis.

### Controversies in Poland syndrome: alternative diagnoses in patients with congenital pectoral muscle deficiency [^117GWJBD]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose

Poland syndrome was first described as a deficiency of the pectoral muscle with ipsilateral symbrachydactyly. Currently, numerous case reports describe variations of Poland syndrome in which pectoral muscle deficiency is often used as the only defining criterion. However, more syndromes can present with pectoral muscle deficiency. The aim of this review is to illustrate the diversity of the phenotypic spectrum of Poland syndrome and to create more awareness for alternative diagnoses in pectoral muscle deficiency.

Methods

A systematic literature search was performed. Articles containing phenotypical descriptions of Poland syndrome were included. Data extraction included number of patients, sex, familial occurrence, and the definition of Poland syndrome used. In addition, hand deformities, thoracic deformities, and other deformities in each patient were recorded. Alternative syndrome diagnoses were identified in patients with a combination of hand, thorax, and other deformities.

Results

One hundred-and-thirty-six articles were included, describing 627 patients. Ten different definitions of Poland syndrome were utilized. In 58% of the cases, an upper extremity deformity was found and 43% of the cases had an associated deformity. Classic Poland syndrome was seen in 29%. Fifty-seven percent of the patients with a pectoral malformation, a hand malformation, and another deformity had at least 1feature that matched an alternative syndrome.

Conclusions

Pectoral muscle hypoplasia is not distinctive for Poland syndrome alone but is also present in syndromes with other associated anomalies with a recognized genetic cause. Therefore, in patients with an atypical phenotype, we recommend considering other diagnoses and/or syndromes before diagnosing a patient with Poland syndrome. This can prevent diagnostic and prognostic errors.

Clinical Relevance

Differentiating Poland syndrome from the alternative diagnoses has serious consequences for the patient and their family in terms of inheritance and possible related anomalies.

### Molecular epidemiology of chronic hepatitis B virus infection in Northern Poland [^116MyWLX]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2005). Low credibility.

Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a global health problem, with more than 350 million people chronically infected worldwide. The chronic HBV infection in Poland is also an essential medical and social problem. Starting from 1993, a steady decline of the incidence of HBV has been observed, reaching the estimated rate of 4.5 per 100 000 in 2004. Nothing is known about the genetic variability of HBV in Poland, the occurrence and spreading of genetic variants and mutants of hepatitis B virus in the population of Polish patients during the course of the disease and in relation to antiviral treatment. It is very interesting to study the molecular epidemiology of the Polish population regarding hepatitis B virus infection as Poland is still ethnically a uniform country, with no more than 3–4% of ethnic minorities. The first results regarding distribution of HBV genotypes and serotypes in northern Poland have been published by our group in 2003 and 2004. This work was part of a scientific project supported by the Fifth Framework Programme initiative of the European Union, entitled "Emerging variants of hepatitis B virus: new tools for epidemiological survey, diagnosis of infection, and monitoring of drug resistance". In the course of the project more than 200 hepatitis B infected patients from the northern part of Poland have been enrolled, diagnosed and - if the viral load of HBV was suitable for analysis - genotyped by sequencing of the HBV pol/S gene fragment. This review presents the main characteristics and some interesting aspects of the studied cohort of chronically infected patients from northern Poland as well as the molecular epidemiology.

It adds that despite the increasing visibility of TGD people, access to knowledgeable and culturally-competent health professionals remain an overwhelming need around the world, and that lack of knowledgeable providers is a major barrier to gender-affirming care for transgender persons and contributes to large health disparities. It also states that the lack of adequate professional education in TGD health is a global problem that occurs at all levels of training.

Pregnancy — Patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during therapy. Fluoxetine should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].

Nursing Mothers — Patients should be advised to notify their physician if they intend to breast-feed an infant during therapy. Because fluoxetine is excreted in human milk, nursing while taking fluoxetine is not recommended [see Use in Specific Populations (8.3)].

Pediatric Use — Fluoxetine is approved for use in pediatric patients with MDD and OCD [see Box Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Limited evidence is available concerning the longer-term effects of fluoxetine on the development and maturation of children and adolescent patients. Height and weight should be monitored periodically in pediatric patients receiving fluoxetine. Safety and effectiveness of fluoxetine and olanzapine in combination in patients less than 18 years of age have not been established [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) and Use in Specific Populations (8.4)].

### Achievement of renal anemia KDIGO targets by two different clinical strategies-a European hemodialysis multicenter analysis [^1137LHDA]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The most important clinical finding of this large multicenter European cross-sectional analysis of all prevalent patients treated at 12 hemodialysis units in Portugal and Poland is that the KDIGO targets for the treatment of renal anemia in hemodialysis were achieved in both countries, but through different clinical practices and strategies. The Hb concentration was similar between countries and the proportion of patients within KDIGO target range was 69.5% in Poland and 65.8% in Portugal. The prescribed monthly doses of iron were 35–72% higher in dialysis facilities in Poland as compared to those in Portugal (p < 0.001). Consequently, the ferritin and TSAT levels and the proportion of HD patients with a TSAT > 20 and > 50% were both significantly higher in HD patients in centers in Poland (88.8 and 14.6%) than in Portugal (76.3 and 5.7%, respectively). In addition, significantly more patients in units in Poland had a ferritin concentration > 800 μg/L (35.6%) compared to those in Portugal (15.8%). By contrast, the prescribed ESA doses were 65% higher in HD patients in dialysis facilities in Portugal (5154 U) than in Poland (3133 U). Multiple and logistic regression analyses showed that with ferritin within KDIGO recommended ranges of 200–800 μg/L the odds for Hb within target range increases significantly. Taken together, both treatment traditions and socioeconomic factors seem to play a role in how anemia is managed in these facilities.

The optimal treatment algorithm for iron therapy and ESA use in anemic HD patients has so far not been established. Many would agree that in clinical practice one should avoid prescribing disproportionately high ESA or iron doses to achieve internationally recommended Hb targets, particularly in patients with significant comorbidity and/or ESA resistance. There were some differences in patient demographics and practices between patients in the clinics in Poland and Portugal in the present study. HD patients in facilities in Portugal were older and had a longer dialysis vintage, while more patients had diabetes and a high Charlson comorbidity index, all indicating a larger comorbidity burden than in patients in units in Poland. Despite this, significantly more patients in centers in Portugal had a serum albumin > 35 g/L and the use of a CVC was less frequent than in units in Poland.

14.2 Reduction in the Incidence of RVVC

A randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial (Trial 3, NCT04029116) was conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of BREXAFEMME 300 mg (two 150 mg tablets) administered approximately 12 hours apart (e.g., in the morning and in the evening) for one day, for a total daily dosage of 600 mg (four 150 mg tablets) administered once monthly for six months. Trial 3 was conducted in the United States (33%), Bulgaria (28%), Poland (12%), and Russia (28%). Non-pregnant post-menarchal females presenting with a symptomatic VVC episode and a history of recurrent VVC (at least 3 episodes of VVC in the previous 12 months) were eligible. The symptomatic episode at Screening was treated with 3 doses of fluconazole 150 mg 3 days apart.

To be randomized, patients had to have a culture-confirmed VVCepisode at Screening and had to achieve significant resolution of their vulvovaginal signs and symptoms (defined as a total composite score ≤ 2 on the VSS Scale) after fluconazole treatment. Patients were randomized at a 1:1 ratio to receive double-blind BREXAFEMME or placebo administered as a single-day treatment repeated every 4 weeks for a total of 6 single-day treatments. Study visits included the test of cure (TOC) at Week 24 (4 weeks after the last dose) and a follow-up visit at Week 36. The intent to treat (ITT) population was all randomized patients.

### Eight patients with multiple bilateral thoracic anomalies: a new syndrome or bilateral Poland's syndrome? [^112DCeHw]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Poland's syndrome is a rare congenital anomaly characterized by an absence or hypoplasia of the greater and smaller pectoral muscles, breast or nipple anomalies, hypoplasia of subcutaneous tissue, chest wall deformities, pectoral and axillary alopecia, and hand anomalies. Poland's syndrome is usually unilateral. We present 8 patients with multiple bilateral thoracic anomalies.

Methods

Eight patients were admitted to our clinic with an abnormal thoracic appearance and restriction of shoulder mobilization. Bilateral multiple muscles, including the greater pectoral muscle and some other thoracic muscles, could not be palpated during physical examination. All patients were evaluated, with a preliminary diagnosis of bilateral Poland's syndrome.

Results

All patients exhibited partial or complete absence of bilateral greater pectoral muscles, absence or hypoplasia of bilateral smaller pectoral muscles, bilateral shoulder protrusion to the front, limited abduction of both shoulders, absence or hypoplasia of other bilateral thoracic muscles (serratus anterior, latissimus dorsi, and trapezius muscles), and scapula alata.

Conclusions

All patients with Poland's syndrome have unilateral hypoplasia or absence of the greater pectoral muscle as the main feature. Poland's syndrome is routinely described as a unilateral syndrome. Cases of Poland's syndrome are typically sporadic. Our patients had different additional bilateral anomalies. In particular, the main problems our patients had were the position of the shoulders and limited abduction of both upper extremities. In contrast to patients with Poland's syndrome, half of our cases were familial. We consider our patients important examples in that they either present a new syndrome or show that Poland's syndrome can be bilateral.

### 'Socialising' primary care? The soviet union, WHO and the 1978 alma-ata conference [^113HN8YL]. BMJ Global Health (2018). Medium credibility.

During the almost decade-long period when the USSR, plus Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Mongolia, Bulgaria and Romania were 'inactive' in WHO, the socialist bloc forged its own system of health cooperation, with the Soviets drawing from their model to help their allies rebuild their health services. Additionally, as early as 1951, the Soviet Union, German Democratic Republic (GDR), Romania and other Eastern European countries began to engage in 'proletarian' health solidarity in North Korea and Vietnam, building on the 1930s medical cooperation extended by the Soviets and Eastern European health leftists to fight Franco's fascists in Spain and the Japanese occupation of China.

Starting in 1956, these cooperative arrangements became institutionalised through annual meetings of public health ministers of socialist countries. viii By the 1960s, questions of housing, sanitation, health infrastructure, pensions and social security had been addressed by most of the 'socialist camp'. Accordingly, meeting agendas turned to issues of medical research and technical developments. Two main priorities emerged: integration and sharing of knowledge and practices across member countries, and country specialisation in particular areas of medical research and production. ix For example, Hungary, and later Poland, became centres of pharmaceutical research and manufacturing, GDR and Czechoslovakia focused on medical devices, and the USSR produced the bulk of vaccines and sera.

Bilateral cooperative health relations also extended beyond the socialist bloc. India's health minister visited Moscow in 1953, and the first agreements on technical and economic assistance to India and Afghanistan were signed the following year. By 1960, the Soviet Union had similar agreements with 14 countries in Asia and Africa, by 1969 with 39, soon reaching some 70 Third World countries, including in Latin America. Activities encompassed construction of health facilities, medical equipment and drug distribution, health education, training and secondment of medical personnel. Unlike Western aid in this period, the USSR sought, where possible, to provide cooperation aimed at building national health systems along the Soviet model of free, universal, public systems organised around a system of polyclinics and secondary and tertiary care facilities.

### Predictors of long-term care use-informal home care recipients versus private and public facilities residents in Poland [^111CytLr]. BMC Geriatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

The aim of our study is to identify factors influencing the use of LTC and the selection of specific forms of residential care in relation to informal care in Poland. According to our knowledge, this is the first study of this type, presenting a quantitative approach based on data from Poland, as well as the first study involving three different types of inpatient LTC facilities, especially still poorly researched private inpatient sector.

In post-communist countries such as Poland, there is high supply of informal care and low supply of formal care. The tendency to use residential care remains low and the caring functions are mainly performed by the family, which suggests that cultural factors shape caring patterns. However, with declining caring potential of families, there is increasing pressure to develop formal forms of LTC. LTC in Poland includes cash and in-kind benefits and is provided by the health care, social assistance and private sectors. Two levels can be distinguished: formal (institutional) care provided at home or in inpatient facilities and informal care (informal caregivers, most often family members). In terms of inpatient care in Poland, as of December 31, 2020, there were 30,638 people in long term care health sector facilities 3, 18,176 people in officially registered private rest homes and 75,133 people in social residential homes. At the same time, the total population of Poland was 38.1 million, of which 7.1 million were aged 65+.

### Childhood asthma prevalence and risk factors in three Eastern European countries – the Belarus, Ukraine, Poland asthma study (BUPAS): an international prevalence study [^115yKTAA]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The prevalence of asthma and other allergic diseases among children living in Eastern is not well described. Our objective was to estimate and compare the prevalence of asthma, respiratory symptoms and allergic diseases in children in Belarus, Ukraine, and Poland as well as to identify risk factors for these conditions. We also sought to profile and compare children with asthma between locations.

Methods

Data were collected as a part of an international, multicenter, cross-sectional study of childhood asthma: The Belarus Ukraine Poland Asthma Study (BUPAS). Subjects were children aged 7–13 years attending primary and secondary schools in the urban and surrounding rural area of Grodno (Belarus), Ternopil (Ukraine) and Silesia Region (Poland). Physician-diagnosed respiratory diseases and symptoms as well as allergic diseases were ascertained using the ISAAC questionnaire completed by the parents.

Results

In total there were 4019 children from Belarus (rural: 2018, urban: 2001), 4493 from Ukraine (1972; 2521), and 4036 from Poland (2002, 2034). The overall response rate was 76.7%. Groups were similar in case of gender and age (p > 0.05). Almost all analyzed respiratory and allergic conditions differed significantly between countries including asthma [Poland (rural, urban): 3.5%, 4.1%; Ukraine: 1.4%, 2.1%; Belarus: 1.4%, 1.5%], spastic bronchitis (Poland: 2.7%, 3.2%; Ukraine: 7.5%, 6.5%; Belarus: 6.4%, 7.9%), and chest wheeze in the last year (Poland: 4.8%, 5.2%; Ukraine: 11.5%, 13.0%; Belarus: 10.7%, 10.0%). These differences remained after adjustment for potential confounders. Risk factor associations were generally similar between outcomes. Symptom characteristics of children with asthma between countries were not consistent. The ratio of current wheeze:diagnosis of asthma differed by country: (Rural areas: Belarus: 10.9:1, Ukraine: 17.3:1, Poland: 2.4:1; Urban areas: Belarus: 8.1:1, Ukraine: 7.3:1 Poland: 1.9:1).

Conclusions

The findings show large between-country differences and relatively low prevalence of asthma and allergic diseases in children of Western Belarus and Ukraine. There is evidence for underdiagnosis of asthma in these regions.

### Cross-national differences in intergenerational family relations: the influence of public policy arrangements [^114Wz8Yk]. Innovation in Aging (2018). Low credibility.

Until recently, research on intergenerational relations rarely included Eastern European countries, with the exception of scholarship inspired by,) dividing line that runs from St. Petersburg, Russia, to Trieste, Italy. Increasingly, data on intergenerational exchanges in Eastern Europe are becoming available. The European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC) report levels of intergenerational coresidence in Eastern Europe that often parallel those in southern Europe. Note, however, that the prevalence of coresidential arrangements in the Czech Republic, Hungary, and the Baltic States resembles that in continental Europe, serving as a reminder that researchers should not engage in whatdescribes as a "Western homogenising view of Eastern European family patterns" (p. 12).included the Czech Republic and Poland in their analyses of subnational variations in family structures. They classify these central and Eastern European regions in terms of "rather weak" (p. 252) family regimes: family members tend to live near one another, but levels of contact are relatively low.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2025 report) [^1149kox8]. GOLD (2025). High credibility.

Vitamin D and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations — vitamin D has an immune-modulating role and has been implicated in the pathophysiology of exacerbations; vitamin D levels are lower in people with COPD than in healthy individuals. Some, but not all studies have shown that supplementation in people with severe deficiency results in a 50% reduction in episodes and hospital admission. Therefore, it is recommended that all patients hospitalized for exacerbations should be assessed and investigated for severe deficiency (< 10 ng/ml or < 25 nM) followed by supplementation if required.

### Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 in farmed mink (neovison vison), Poland [^112UZEnb]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Figure 1
Timeline of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections in mink farms, Europe, according to the World Organisation for Animal Health. We investigated SARS-CoV-2 in mink sampled on November 24, 2020, in Pomorskie Voivodeship, northern Poland. The Polish National Veterinary Research Institute, as a national unit responsible for reporting to the World Organisation for Animal Health, detected SARS-CoV-2 infection in the same mink farm on January 30, 2021.

Poland is the second-largest producer of mink pelts in Europe. Poland has 810 fur animal farms, including those for foxes, mink, raccoons, dogs, and chinchillas. The 354 active mink farms in Poland contain ≈6.3 million mink. During 2019, mink farmers in Poland sold 8.5 million mink pelts.

As of May 5, 2021, Poland had recorded 2,838,180 COVID-19 cases and 70,336 total related deaths. Considering the recent reports of SARS-CoV-2 infections in mink in other countries in Europe and the high incidence of human SARS-CoV-2 infections in Poland, we monitored SARS-CoV-2 in mink on 1 farm in Pomorskie Voivodeship in northern Poland.

### A rare coexistence: Poland's syndrome and cardiac angiosarcoma [^111kSCKV]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Poland's syndrome is a genetic disorder of unknown origin characterized by the absence of the pectoralis major muscle. The incidence of Poland's syndrome ranges from 1 in 7,000 to 1 in 100,000 live births. Congenital anomalies including upper limb malformations have been reported; cardiac and urologic disorders may also be associated with the syndrome. Cases of Poland's syndrome associated with leukemia and carcinoma confirm the association between developmental defects and tumors and require oncologic awareness.

Primary cardiac neoplasms are rare malignant tumors. Benign myxomas constitute the majority of them. Of the remaining 25% of tumors, angiosarcomas are one of the subtypes. In this study, we would like to present a case of rapidly progressing cardiac angiosarcoma, surgical management and postoperative follow-up in a 24-year-old female patient with Poland's syndrome.

Abstract

Poland syndrome is a rare congenital anomaly characterized by unilateral aplasia of the sternoclavicular head of pectoralis major muscle with varying degree of same side upper limb anomalies. A 44-year-old man, with a case of adenocarcinoma of stomach, whose CECT chest revealed complete absence of pectoralis major and minor muscles on the left side, was diagnosed with Poland syndrome without presence of typical ipsilateral limb anomalies. Follow-up PET/CT revealed metabolically active recurrent disease with typical findings of Poland syndrome. It is important to be aware of oncologic association in a patient of Poland syndrome as highlighted in the present case.

### Radiation oncology in a humanitarian emergency: experience with Ukrainian refugees at 2 cancer centers in Poland and Italy [^112Eqwd3]. Advances in Radiation Oncology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

War has a major effect on health care systems, not only due to combat-related trauma, but also to the major indirect effects on civilian infrastructure such as hospitals, which are often obliged to redirect care to trauma victims, thus leaving fewer resources available to manage other patients. This can negatively affect the frailest patients, such as those with cancer. This situation is even more serious when health care infrastructure and services are directly involved in the conflict, as in Ukraine. War can negatively affect mental health in the general population, including those with medical conditions, and may have long-term consequences.

In the current war in Ukraine, large numbers of refugees, mostly women and children, have migrated to nearby countries, including Poland, Hungary, Romania, Slovakia, and Moldova. Ukraine has a population of 44 million, with cancer epidemiology rates that are similar to other European countries. Many refugees have moved on from those countries to other European countries. Some of these refugees have medical conditions, including cancer, that require treatment.

Since late February of this year (2022), more than 2 million people have crossed the border between the Ukraine and Poland. Presently, the daily inflow is approximately 10,000. In addition, there is a large population of Ukrainians — close to 2 million people — residing legally in Poland, most of whom have migrated in search of work. Some experts predict that the total number of Ukrainian refugees in Poland may eventually reach up to 5 million, mostly women and children and men over age 60. A new law was recently passed in Poland allowing eligible Ukrainians — defined as those entering Poland from Ukraine after February 24th — to receive the government-issued PESEL, a personal identification number necessary to access the National Health System. After passage of this new law, cancer hospitals in Poland have agreed with the National Health System to establish a central hotline in the Ukrainian language and to develop a network of coordinators to refer patients in need of oncological care to hospitals in the various provinces. In the Greater Poland region, the Greater Poland Cancer Center (GPCC) in Poznan (the regional capital) has assumed the role of provincial coordinator.

### A comparative analysis of methods of preinduction cervical ripening and induction of labor in Poland and in Germany (part II): maternal and neonatal outcomes [^11468fUR]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Results

The study included a total of 304 women who had indications for preinduction cervical ripening or induction of labor. In the Republic of Poland and the Federal Republic of Germany, 154 and 150 women were examined, respectively. The average age of patients who underwent preinduction cervical ripening or induction of labor in both Poland and Germany was 28. The average gestational age in Poland was 277 days (39 weeks + 4 days), and in Germany, it was 278 days (39 weeks + 5 days). In Poland, the highest percentage concerned women (63.64%) in their first pregnancy. In Germany, in the third pregnancy or more, there were 38.00% of women. Whereas, 62.67% (p < 0.001) of women gave birth at least once or more. The most common complication among the examined patients was gestational diabetes (18.18% in Poland and 14.67% in Germany). Significantly more Polish women (p = 0.033) had a history of struggling with hypertension 9.09% and hypothyroidism 17.53% than from Germany (p < 0.001) – Table 1.

The efficacy results are presented in Table 2. There were no statistically significant differences (p = 0.089) between postpartum hemoglobin values in both Polish and German patients, they were similar. The number of days of preinduction cervical ripening and induction of labor was similar in Poland and Germany. The median, mean and minimum represent the same values. The maximum number of days on which patients in Poland underwent pre-induction and labor induction was 5 days, while in Germany it was 6 days. The average change on the Bishop scale in Poland was significantly lower (p = 0.001) and amounted to 1.6 ± 2.6 points, whereas in Germany it was 2.7 ± 2.5 points. In Poland, the duration of hospitalization was shorter than in Germany and averaged 3.8 ± 1.9 days.

Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline — evidence for diabetes prevention in adults with prediabetes: The commissioned systematic review included 11 RCTs on new-onset diabetes in adults with prediabetes (total of 5316 participants), conducted in India (n = 4), Iran (n = 1), Greece (n = 1), Norway (n = 1), Japan (n = 1), and the United States (n = 3). In pooled analyses, vitamin D reduced the risk of developing diabetes (RR 0.90 [95% CI, 0.81–1.00]), and including the DPVD trial produced similar results (RR 0.90 [95% CI, 0.81–0.99]). An individual participant data meta-analysis of the 3 vitamin D trials (total of 4190 participants) showed a 15% reduction in new-onset diabetes in adults with prediabetes randomized to vitamin D compared to placebo (HR 0.85 [95% CI, 0.75–0.96]). The beneficial effect of vitamin D on diabetes risk was described as consistent across subgroups by risk of bias or vitamin D dosage.

### Risk of psychosis among migrants to the Netherlands by time since arrival [^114FXMFv]. Psychological Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Interpretation of findings

How should we interpret the high relative risks in an early stage for migrants from non-Western countries, especially sub-Saharan Africa, and Eastern Europe? Migrants from Eastern Europe, mostly from Poland, the former Soviet Union and Bulgaria, usually perform low-skilled work in the agricultural sector, while those from Western Europe are often highly educated knowledge workers (de Boom, Weltevrede, Rezai, & Engbersen). Since migrants from Eastern Europe and non-Western countries share a low income and status, our findings are compatible with the social defeat hypothesis of psychosis, which posits that the chronic experience of a subordinate or outsider position increases the risk, possibly by sensitising a dopamine pathway (Egerton et al; McCutcheon, Abi-Dargham, & Howes; Selten & Cantor-Graae). Other related stressors proposed to contribute to the increased risk among migrants include the stress of acculturation, linguistic distance and discrimination (Dykxhoorn & Kirkbride; Jongsma et al; Stilo et al.). However, since the effect of social stressors is supposed to become more serious with lapse of time, it is uncertain whether they fully explain the high relative risks already in the early years following arrival. It is also possible that stressors present in the country of origin or during the process of migration contribute to these relative risks. Furthermore, our findings do not exclude an important role of social stressors in the host country at time intervals beyond those of the present study.

### Molecular epidemiology and genetic diversity of orthohantaviruses in small mammals in Western Poland [^112dCc9g]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Medium credibility.

Orthohantaviruses are negative-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses harbored by multiple small mammals. Dobrava-Belgrade virus (DOBV) and Puumala virus (PUUV) cause hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) in Europe. In Poland, serological surveys have demonstrated antibodies against DOBV and PUUV in patients with HFRS. Molecular evidence of DOBV and PUUV has been found in Apodemus flavicollis and Myodes glareolus, respectively, in southeastern Poland, and Seewis virus (SWSV) has been reported in Sorex araneus in central Poland. However, data on the geographic distribution and phylogeny of orthohantaviruses are unavailable for other regions in Poland. To ascertain the prevalence and genetic diversity of orthohantaviruses in western and northern Poland, lung tissues from 106 small mammals were analyzed for the presence of orthohantavirus RNA. DOBV and SWSV were detected in two of 42 (4.8%) Apodemus agrarius and in three of 10 (30%) S. araneus, respectively. Phylogenetic analyses of partial L- and S-segment sequences of DOBV indicated a shared genetic lineage with the Kurkino genotype from Slovakia, Russia, and Hungary, whereas the partial M segment of DOBV clustered with the Kurkino genotype from Germany. Phylogenetic relationships of the SWSV L and S segments showed a geographic lineage with SWSV strains from central Poland, Czech Republic, and Germany. In conclusion, the study provides insights into the molecular prevalence, phylogenetic diversity, and evolutionary relationship of DOBV in A. agrarius and SWSV in S. araneus. This report increases awareness among physicians for HFRS outbreaks in western Poland.

### Aleutian mink disease virus in the breeding environment in Poland and its place in the global epidemiology of AMDV [^113PnPxY]. Virus Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Aleutian mink disease (AMD) leads to an increase in mortality of animals and causes losses in mink farming. The study investigated the presence of AMDV in tissue and environmental samples from farmed mink in Poland, and selected samples were genetically characterized. Blood, spleens and swabs from the breeding environment were collected on 27 farms in seven voivodeships in Poland (n = 250). DNA was isolated, amplified by PCR and subsequently subjected to sequencing to reveal information on the molecular epidemiology of the samples. A qPCR method was used to determine the viral load in test samples. The presence of AMDV was confirmed in tissues and the farm environment on 26 of the 27 farms. The average viral load in spleens was 10⁸ copies. The virus was also present in the blood (average − 10⁵ copies) and the farm environment (average − 10³ copies). Isolates from the West Pomeranian Voivodeship showed high similarity within the voivodeship (over 99%). Variants from the Lublin and Podlaskie Voivodeships differed 5% from any of the AMDV isolates present in the NCBI database. Isolates from the Greater Poland, Pomeranian, Podkarpackie and Lesser Poland Voivodeships formed heterogeneous clades, showing over 97% similarity to variants previously isolated in Poland, the Netherlands and Lithuania. A high degree of genetic variation was identified among the majority of the samples, which indicates that AMDV has been introduced to Poland multiple times. However, the results within one area showed high identity between isolates, suggesting that one common ancestor was the source of these outbreaks.

Bendamustine is a bifunctional molecule with both alkylating and antimetabolite properties, synthesized in 1963 by Ozegowski and Krebs in East Germany (German Democratic Republic). Widely used in Eastern Europe for lymphoma and myeloma therapy during the 1970s and 1980s, bendamustine was not studied in well-designed clinical trials until the 2000s. Unique among other recently developed antineoplastic drugs, bendamustine shows high activity and is now approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA), being part of the therapeutic armamentarium in indolent and aggressive B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHLs), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) and multiple myeloma (MM). "Bendamustine: role and clinical evidence in lymphoma therapy" is the title of a workshop which took place in Bologna, Italy, on 28 January 2013. This meeting focused on the development, mechanisms of action and evidence supporting the use of bendamustine in lymphoma therapy. This report summarizes the drug development steps, mechanisms of action, clinical results and rationale of use of bendamustine in different lymphoma subtypes, as discussed during the meeting, with the aim of helping the clinician regarding optimal use of this compound in a wide spectrum of lymphoproliferative disorders.

Phylogeny of SARS-CoV-2 in Russia, lineage B.1.1.

Notation is the same as in Fig. 2. The inset summarizes the distribution of Russian singletons, stem clusters and transmission lineages across major SARS-CoV-2 clades.

We aimed to identify distinct introductions of SARS-CoV-2 into Russia. Phylogenetically, each of the 211 Russian sequences belongs to one of the three categories (Fig. 4). Firstly, 77 (36%) of these sequences form the 9 distinct Russian transmission lineages (Figs. 2–4), defined as monophyletic groups (clades) carrying more than one sequence all of which are Russian. These lineages indicate within-Russia transmission of introduced variants. Three of these lineages had no Russian sequences at their ancestral nodes, indicating that they originated from at least three distinct introduction events (Fig. 5c, d; Supplementary Note).

Each 10 mL vial contains 12.0 mg of sodium pyrophosphate, 2.8 mg minimum stannous tin as stannous chloride dihydrate and 4.9 mg maximum total tin as stannous chloride dihydrate; pH is adjusted to 5.3–5.7 with hydrochloric acid prior to lyophilization. No bacteriostatic preservative is present. Sealed under nitrogen.

The chemical names are: (1) Diphosphoric acid, Ditin (2+) salt; (2) Ditin (2+) pyrophosphate (4-). The structural formula is:

When a solution of sterile, non-pyrogenic, oxidant-free isotonic Sodium Pertechnetate Tc 99m Injection U.S.P. is added to the vial, Technetium Tc 99m Pyrophosphate Injection is formed for intravenous injection.

When a solution of sterile, non-pyrogenic, isotonic saline is added to the vial, it forms

a blood pool imaging agent when Sodium Pertechnetate Tc 99m Injection is injected intravenously 30 minutes after the intravenous administration of the non-radioactive reconstituted Kit for the Preparation of Technetium Tc 99m Pyrophosphate Injection. The precise structure of Technetium Tc 99m Pyrophosphate Injection is not known at this time.

Physical Characteristics

Technetium Tc 99m decays by isomeric transition with a physical half-life of 6.02 hours.¹ The principal photon that is useful for detection and imaging studies is listed in Table 1.

¹Kocher DC: Radioactive decay data tables. DOE/TIC-11026: 108, 1981

External Radiation

The specific gamma ray constant for Tc 99m is 0.78 R/hr-millicurie at 1 cm. The first half-value layer is 0.017 cm of lead (Pb). A range of values for the relative attenuation of the radiation emitted by this radionuclide that results from interposition of various thicknesses of Pb is shown in Table 2. For example, the use of a 0.25 cm thickness of Pb will attenuate the radiation emitted by a factor of about 1,000.

To correct for physical decay of this radionuclide, the fractions that remain at selected intervals after the time of calibration are shown in Table 3.

- travel history to a mpox endemic country in the 21 days before symptom onset

- multiple or anonymous sexual partners in the 21 days before symptom onset

- positive orthopoxvirus serology, in the absence of smallpox vaccination or other known exposure to orthopoxviruses

- hospitalized due to the illness.

### The influence of SARS-CoV-2 variants B.1.1.7 and B.1.617.2 on a different clinical course and severity of COVID-19 in children hospitalized in 2021 compared with 2020 [^115uSzQh]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

This study aimed to analyze the differences in the epidemiologic and clinical characteristics of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in children hospitalized in 2021, when the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 variants B.1.1.7 (alpha) and B.1.617.2 (delta) dominated, compared with 2020.

Methods

In this multicenter study based on the pediatric part of the national SARSTer register (SARSTer-PED), we included 2771 children (0–18 years) with COVID-19 diagnosed between March 1, 2020, and December 31, 2021, from 14 Polish inpatient centers. An electronic questionnaire, which addressed epidemiologic and clinical data, was used.

Results

Children hospitalized in 2021 were younger compared with those reported in 2020 (mean 4.1 vs. 6.8 years, P = 0.01). Underlying comorbidities were reported in 22% of the patients. The clinical course was usually mild (70%). A significant difference in the clinical course assessment between 2020 and 2021 was found, with more asymptomatic patients in 2020 and more severely ill children in 2021. In total, 5% of patients were severely or critically ill, including < 3% of the participants in 2020 and 7% in 2021. The calculated mortality rate was 0.1% in general and 0.2% in 2021.

Conclusion

Infections with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 variants alpha and delta lead to a more severe course of COVID-19 with more pronounced clinical presentation and higher fatality rates than infection with an original strain. Most of the children requiring hospitalization due to COVID-19 do not have underlying comorbidities.

### Triazolam [^113JPZFd]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

WARNING: RISKS FROM CONCOMITANT USE WITH OPIOIDS; ABUSE, MISUSE, AND ADDICTION; and DEPENDENCE AND WITHDRAWAL REACTIONS

Concomitant use of benzodiazepines and opioids may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. Reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. Limit dosages and durations to the minimum required. Follow patients for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Drug Interactions (7.1)].
The use of benzodiazepines, including triazolam, exposes users to risks of abuse, misuse, and addiction, which can lead to overdose or death. Abuse and misuse of benzodiazepines commonly involve concomitant use of other medications, alcohol, and/or illicit substances, which is associated with an increased frequency of serious adverse outcomes. Before prescribing triazolam and throughout treatment, assess each patient's risk for abuse, misuse, and addiction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].
The continued use of benzodiazepines, including triazolam, may lead to clinically significant physical dependence. The risks of dependence and withdrawal increase with longer treatment duration and higher daily dose. Abrupt discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction of triazolam after continued use may precipitate acute withdrawal reactions, which can be life-threatening. To reduce the risk of withdrawal reactions, use a gradual taper to discontinue triazolam or reduce the dosage [see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

### Spatial disparities in the mortality burden of the COVID-19 pandemic across 569 European regions (2020–2021) [^115ixJ9K]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Since its emergence in December 2019, the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a significant increase in deaths worldwide. This article presents a detailed analysis of the mortality burden of the COVID-19 pandemic across 569 regions in 25 European countries. We produce age and sex-specific excess mortality and present our results using Age-Standardised Years of Life Lost in 2020 and 2021, as well as the cumulative impact over the two pandemic years. Employing a forecasting approach based on CP-splines that considers regional diversity and provides confidence intervals, we find notable losses in 362 regions in 2020 (440 regions in 2021). Conversely, only seven regions experienced gains in 2020 (four regions in 2021). We also estimate that eight regions suffered losses exceeding 20 years of life per 1000 population in 2020, whereas this number increased to 75 regions in 2021. The contiguity of the regions investigated in our study also reveals the changing geographical patterns of the pandemic. While the highest excess mortality values were concentrated in the early COVID-19 outbreak areas during the initial pandemic year, a clear East-West gradient appeared in 2021, with regions of Slovakia, Hungary, and Latvia experiencing the highest losses. This research underscores the importance of regional analyses for a nuanced comprehension of the pandemic's impact.

### Radiation oncology in the developing economies of central and Eastern Europe [^1154gXMg]. Seminars in Radiation Oncology (2017). Low credibility.

Eastern Europe is represented by 22 countries of significant variability in population density and degree of economic development. They have been affected by past geopolitical isolation due to their association with the "Soviet Block". Currently, all Eastern European countries except Slovenia are low- or middle-income level and 10 of them are part of European Union. Health care systems in Central and Eastern Europe have been influenced by the legacy of centralized soviet-era governance; however, most countries, particularly in European Union zone, have gone through health care reforms directed toward modernizing infrastructure and staffing. The level of health financing available through health insurance has increased in the region, although still lags behind the Western European levels. After adjusting for differing population age structures, overall incidence rates in both sexes are lower in Eastern and Central Europe compared with the Northern and Western European countries; however, mortality remains higher. There is an ongoing shortage of oncology services in Eastern Europe, including radiotherapy equipment and personnel. Eastern European radiotherapy field is highly diverse with large differences among countries regarding staffing structure, training, accreditation, and defined roles and responsibilities. The rapid diffusion of technological innovations has been identified as one of the most important factors driving the escalating health care expenses, and the need for better cost-effective solutions applicable to the local health care systems and levels of economic development.

### Prevention in COVID-19 time: from failure to future [^111gojLJ]. Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health (2020). Medium credibility.

The COVID-19 pandemic has developed as a consequence of sheer prevention failures, leading in many countries to a sizeable number of deaths and over-saturation of intensive care units. This triggered the imposition of generalisd quarantine ('lockdown') of variable stringency in different countries: with the decrease of the epidemic, the lockdown is now gradually relaxed and replaced by tight tracing and isolation of new cases and their contacts. Prevention, however, remains not a constant priority, as the objective may be avoidance of saturation of intensive care beds or more generally of healthcare facilities rather than the minimisation of the disease incidence. This combined with the fact that notwithstanding repeated warnings in past years the epidemic occurred as a surprise denotes a way of thinking in which prevention is an important option but not a guiding principle of choice and action within the health system. To modify this way of thinking and place prevention at the core of the system, non-negligible changes are required: they may become possible in light of emerging hazards like new viruses and climate change, huge economic costs of failed prevention and initial changes in the health system already induced by the COVID-19 epidemic.

Results

From over 100.7 million people (51.5% male, 68.0% with ≥ 70 years) reported as deceased from 2012 to 2021 across 32 countries, 20.4% died from cancer (range per country: 10.8%–29.8%, Mexico and Slovenia, respectively) and 5.8% died from dementia (0.1%–18.0%, Bulgaria and Finland) (Table 1; values per country in Supplementary File 5). Women died at more advanced age (75.6% with ≥ 70 years vs. 59.7% in men). In 2020–2021, 12.4% of deaths were caused by COVID-19 (1.3%–20.5%, Finland and Mexico), and this percentage was lower in women (8.5% in included countries). During the study period, the number of cancer deaths increased in 17 out of 28 countries (0.2%–29.5%, Sweden and Cyprus) (Supplementary File 6). The percentage of deaths caused by dementia increased in 22/28 countries (0.1%–6.6%, Romania and Finland).

### The genetic prehistory of the baltic sea region [^114XJJTM]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

While the series of events that shaped the transition between foraging societies and food producers are well described for Central and Southern Europe, genetic evidence from Northern Europe surrounding the Baltic Sea is still sparse. Here, we report genome-wide DNA data from 38 ancient North Europeans ranging from ~9500 to 2200 years before present. Our analysis provides genetic evidence that hunter-gatherers settled Scandinavia via two routes. We reveal that the first Scandinavian farmers derive their ancestry from Anatolia 1000 years earlier than previously demonstrated. The range of Mesolithic Western hunter-gatherers extended to the east of the Baltic Sea, where these populations persisted without gene-flow from Central European farmers during the Early and Middle Neolithic. The arrival of steppe pastoralists in the Late Neolithic introduced a major shift in economy and mediated the spread of a new ancestry associated with the Corded Ware Complex in Northern Europe.

### It is time for consensus on' consensus statements' [^112FNwW4]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Do consensus statements deserve the prestige they are afforded?

Expert opinion sits at the base of the evidence pyramid but when those experts gather, and take recent systematic reviews into account, their output — consensus statements — are given great weight. Consensus statements are some of the most downloaded and cited publications. They can inform state and sporting policy, which opens up the potential to impact individual behaviour and eventually patient outcomes. Judging how much to trust consensus statement recommendations can be difficult (see figure 1). How can the research community (consensus creators, Journal editors, media channels) ensure the great weight given to consensus statements is supported by a scientific, rigorous, transparent, replicable and equitable process?
