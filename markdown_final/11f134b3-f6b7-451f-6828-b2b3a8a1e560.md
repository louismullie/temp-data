## Question

As entropy in a system increases, energy in the system

Answer Choices:
A. becomes more ordered
B. becomes less ordered
C. reaches equilibrium
D. moves toward destruction

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how energy in a system behaves as entropy increases, with options including becoming more ordered, less ordered, reaching equilibrium, or moving toward destruction. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the thermodynamic definition of entropy and its relationship to disorder. Then, I should verify how energy is distributed as entropy rises. Next, I will examine whether equilibrium is a consequence of increasing entropy or a separate state. After that, I need to check whether "destruction" is a scientifically precise term in this context. Finally, I will align the best answer with the second law of thermodynamics and supported examples from the literature.

> Let me first confirm the core concept: entropy is a measure of disorder or the number of accessible microstates, and the second law states that isolated systems tend toward higher entropy over time, which corresponds to greater dispersal of energy and less ability to do useful work.

> Wait, let me verify the energy–disorder link. As entropy increases, energy becomes more dispersed and less concentrated, which is precisely what we mean by "less ordered" energy; conversely, lower entropy corresponds to more ordered, usable energy distributions, so option B ("becomes less ordered") aligns with this principle.

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about equilibrium. I initially thought "reaches equilibrium" might be correct because systems often evolve toward equilibrium as entropy rises, but that conflates a consequence with the direct answer to what happens to energy; equilibrium is a state the system may reach, not a description of how the energy itself is arranged, so C is not the best choice for the question asked.

> I need to check the wording of option D. "Moves toward destruction" is imprecise; thermodynamics doesn't describe energy as being "destroyed", it describes energy becoming less available to do work as entropy increases, so D is misleading and not the correct scientific framing.

> Let me consider concrete examples to ensure consistency. In synthetic out-of-equilibrium replicators, continuous fuel input maintains a far-from-equilibrium, lower-entropy state; when fuel is withdrawn, the system degrades toward equilibrium with higher entropy and less ordered energy distributions, illustrating that rising entropy tracks with energy becoming less ordered [^eae2f9f4] [^3634d4db]. Similarly, in materials science, rejuvenation processes that destroy short-range order increase entropy and push the system to a higher-energy, less ordered configuration, again linking higher entropy with less ordered energy states [^91730366].

> Putting this together, the thermodynamically sound answer is B: as entropy increases, energy in the system becomes less ordered, reflecting greater dispersal and reduced capacity for useful work.

---

The correct answer is **B. becomes less ordered**. As entropy increases, energy becomes more dispersed and less available to do useful work, which corresponds to less order. Options A and D are incorrect because energy does not become more ordered or "move toward destruction" as entropy rises. Option C is misleading because while systems may approach equilibrium as entropy increases, the question is about the **order of energy**, not the system's state.

---

## Thermodynamic definition of entropy

Entropy is a measure of **disorder or randomness** in a system; higher entropy means greater disorder and less organization. The second law of thermodynamics states that in isolated systems, entropy tends to increase over time, driving systems toward equilibrium.

---

## Relationship between entropy and energy order

As entropy increases, energy becomes more dispersed and less concentrated, making it **less ordered**. This means energy is less available to perform useful work because it is spread out over more microstates.

---

## Analysis of answer choices

- **A. becomes more ordered**: Incorrect. Higher entropy corresponds to less order, not more.
- **B. becomes less ordered**: Correct. Energy disperses as entropy rises, reducing order.
- **C. reaches equilibrium**: Misleading. While systems may approach equilibrium as entropy increases, the question is about energy order, not the system's state.
- **D. moves toward destruction**: Incorrect. "Destruction" is vague and not a thermodynamic term; energy is conserved but becomes less ordered.

---

## Examples illustrating the concept

- **Gas expansion**: Gas molecules spread out, increasing entropy and making their kinetic energy less ordered.
- **Heat transfer**: Energy disperses from hot to cold regions, increasing entropy and reducing local order.
- **Chemical reactions**: Reactants form products with higher entropy, dispersing energy and decreasing order.

---

## Conclusion

As entropy increases, energy in the system **becomes less ordered** because it disperses over more microstates, reducing its capacity to do useful work.

### Exponential self-replication enabled through a fibre elongation / breakage mechanism [^2b22748e]. Nature Communications (2015). Medium credibility.

where F is a food molecule, R is a replicator, D is a destroying agent and W a waste molecule. The rate of replicator formation is given in by equation 3, in which k R and k D are the rate constants for the replication and destruction reaction, respectively. The order of the replication process in food and replicator are given by f and r, and the order of the destruction process in replicator and destroying agent are given by d and x, respectively. In order for competition to result in destruction of the weakest replicator (a necessary but not sufficient requirement for Darwinian evolution), the order in replicator in the replication process has to be higher than or equal to the order in replicator in its destruction reaction (that is, r ≥ d). In most plausible replicator destruction scenarios d equals 1, for example, by a bimolecular reaction with a destroying agent shown in equation 2 or by removal of products through flowing part of the solution out of the system. Therefore, for most common competition/destruction scenarios, an order in replicator of at least 1 (that is, exponential replication) is required to achieve Darwinian evolution. Although systems have been reported that move from parabolic towards exponential replication, few systems have been reported which achieve r ≥ 1 non-autonomouslyor autonomously, but even in these examples no general mechanism for exponential growth was reported. The lack of design criteria for self-replicators capable of exponential growth constitutes a major problem that needs to be solved before approaches to Darwinian evolution of synthetic molecules can become mainstream.

We now report a new mechanism by which exponential replication can be achieved based on a fibre growth/breakage mechanism acting on self-assembling replicators. In principle, replication through this mechanism could give rise to exponential growth, as each time a fibre breaks this doubles the number of fibre ends. We now demonstrate experimentally that the replication process in our system is consistent with exponential growth. We then offer experimental insights into the mechanism of replication: a key role for fibre breakage is evident from the fact that the stirring rate influences both the rate of replication and the concentration of fibre ends. We demonstrate a direct correlation between average fibre length and replication rate. Furthermore, we show that fibre length distributions remain constant during replication, which is necessary in order to achieve exponential replication. Finally, we also confirm computationally that our hypothesized fibre elongation/breakage mechanism results in exponential replication and that the fibre breakage step is required for exponential growth.

### A chemically fuelled self-replicator [^eae2f9f4]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Fig. 5
Self-replication maintained out-of-equilibrium by addition of a chemical fuel: a Chemical structures and reactions involved in the out-of-equilibrium system. b Continuous supply of an oxidising fuel to the aqueous phase (by syringe pump) completes the substrate cycle and allows 4 to reach a steady state. By the chemically fuelled continuous regeneration of 2 the rates of formation and destruction of surfactant 4 can be balanced so that while individual molecules are continuously formed and destroyed the overall concentration remains steady. Once fuel supply is halted, the entire system degrades towards equilibrium with the destruction of 4 by excess 1 and the formation of waste products 3 and 5. c Initial rate of oxidant supplied was 10 μL h −1 for 8 h, then 5 μL h −1 for 21 h. Lowering the rate of fuel supply causes the system to adapt to a new steady state with a lower concentration. Less fuel effectively limits the starting materials for the autocatalytic reactions; less 2 is available and 4 can no longer maintain as high a concentration. Once the fuel supply is halted, the entire system degrades towards equilibrium. d After an initial rate of fuel supply of 5 μL h −1 for 9 h, the rate was raised to 10 μL h −1 for a further 20 h. Increasing fuel supply allows the system to support higher replicator concentrations and maintain a position further removed from equilibrium. The concentration of reaction components was monitored by UPLC. Each plotted point in b, c is the average of three reactions and in d of two reactions. Error bars represent the standard deviation

Upon stopping the fuel supply the entire system decays toward equilibrium so that 4 is completely consumed, demonstrating that the observed steady state concentrations of 2, 3, and 4 are not equilibrium nor kinetically trapped positions. Chemical fuel energy consumed by the system is therefore used to drive the metabolic cycle, via the production of components that are thermodynamically and/or kinetically unstable; halting the fuel supply stops regenerating 2 and results in movement towards the equilibrium state.

The current system does not regenerate octanethiol 1 and one equivalent is consumed in each course of the substrate cycle. The system therefore requires an excess of nucleophile 1, which also, importantly, provides the necessary phase separation, although as further reaction cycles are completed phase separation should be maintained by generation of 5. We point out that if 1 were completely consumed then the reaction mixture, after halting of fuel supply and final equilibration, would be expected to contain some 4.

### Moving beyond cytotoxicity in cancer immunotherapy: embracing tumor microenvironment remodeling for durable control [^00966f49]. British Journal of Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

Transforming cancer immunotherapy: moving beyond destruction to tissue-remodeling approaches

Clinical trials in cancer immunotherapy have revealed that while destructive approaches - such as CAR T cells, ICIs, bispecific T cell engagers (BiTEs), passive antibody therapies, allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, and cancer vaccines - can initially shrink tumors, however they often lead to relapse as the TME adapts to evade immune detection (Table 4). For instance, therapies targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway can induce significant initial tumor shrinkage but frequently fail to maintain long-term control as tumors develop immune evasion mechanisms. Similarly, CAR T-cell therapy has demonstrated initial effectiveness in hematologic cancers, yet yields inconsistent results in solid tumors, where the immunosuppressive TME actively resists immune attacks, creating barriers to sustained tumor control and risking off-target effects in normal tissues. Given these challenges, a shift toward tissue-remodeling immunotherapies is gaining traction. Instead of solely aiming for tumor destruction, this approach seeks to reprogram the TME and restore tissue integrity, leveraging the immune system's inherent roles in tissue repair, regeneration, and immune surveillance. In such modulated TME, tumors are expected to shrink. Evidence of natural tumor dormancy in healthy individuals, as highlighted in recent reviews, suggests that maintaining tissue integrity may prevent cancer development from latent malignant cells. Chronic tissue injury, on the other hand, disrupts this balance, creating conditions conducive to cancer progression - a phenomenon often likened to a "non-healing wound". For example, aging, UV radiation, and chronic irritants can impair skin homeostasis, promoting malignancy. Thus, restoring tissue integrity through immunotherapy could remodel the TME, making it hostile to tumor growth.

### Rare and highly destructive wildfires drive human migration in the U.S [^4f8148f6]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Our analysis presents results for the full decile of most destructive wildfires (N = 519), as well as for three subsets of these events stratified by destruction severity: the less destructive portion of the decile (N = 463), the more destructive portion of the decile (N = 55), and the most destructive event, the Camp Fire (N = 1). Each subset of wildfires is presented in its own row in Table 1. To address the potential for spatial spillover and ensure the robustness of our findings, we report regression coefficients derived from comparison to three distinct sets of control groups. Each set of controls was selected from a different distance away from the burned tracts (0–5 miles, 5–25 miles, and 25–50 miles, shown in Fig. 2c) to reflect both heterogeneity in and uncertainty about the extent of spatial spillover.

When analyzing the full top decile of destructive wildfires (between 14 and 18,804 structures destroyed per event), we observed significant and positive out-migration effects during the event quarter when using the 5-mile and 50-mile control sets (Table 1, columns A and C). This migratory effect became larger in magnitude during the first year after the event, with estimates ranging from 0.0048 when using the 5-mile control set and 0.0044 when using the 50-mile control set (Table 1, columns A-C). Put differently, burned tracts experienced 4–5 additional movers per thousand residents, on average, in the year after the fire compared to unburned tracts.

We subsequently analyzed different components of the full decile and observed that wildfires in the less destructive portion of the decile (between 14 and 257 structures destroyed) caused almost no significant changes to out-migration probability. There was only a slight decrease in out-migration probability in the event quarter when using the 25-mile control set (Table 1, column B), however this effect was not evident when using either alternative control set. The lack of migratory effects among events with lower levels of structure loss and during any disaster or post-disaster time period means that, absent high levels of structure loss, we did not observe population-level migration changes that would indicate wildfires spurred changing residential preferences or capabilities and, subsequently, migration decisions.

### Rare and highly destructive wildfires drive human migration in the U.S [^da07baea]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

In recent decades, wildfire destruction of the built environment has grown dramatically, posing a growing threat to human settlements across the U.S. This trend is driven in part by changes in wildfire patterns, with records showing increases in total acres burned, number of large fires, and length of fire weather season –. Models project that, under climate change, the potential for very large fires will increase in the coming decades. Concurrent to the rise in wildfire frequency and severity, the number of people living in high fire risk regions has increased, with substantial population and housing growth in areas in close proximity to or intermixed with wildlands. Consequently, an increasing number of dwellings and their residents are exposed to wildfires.

The growing scale of wildfire destruction to buildings has the potential to impact human mobility patterns, yet little is known about the relationship between wildfire destruction and human migration. Wildfire-related mobility is notably absent in systematic reviews of environmental migration literature –, a gap highlighted by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.

Previous studies of other environmental hazards indicate that climate-migration relationships vary widely in their direction and magnitude, differing between hazard types, as well as by the geographic, social, and economic contexts of affected populations. While in some studies, weather and climate extremes are associated with heightened out-migration, in others, hazards cause minimal impact and relative immobility –. Given this heterogeneity of hazard-mobility relationships, researchers working in this field do not expect consistent or simple "push" effects, in which residents necessarily move away from hazardous places. Instead, environmental migration scholarship investigates a range of different migration and non-migration responses to environmental change, with special attention to distinct hazards and the thresholds at which migratory effects occur.

The null hypothesis to the direct and indirect hypotheses of wildfire-induced mobility is, conversely, immobility: migration flows into and out of fire-affected areas will not change in response to wildfire events. Immobility is informed by residents' desires to remain in place or to move, their capabilities to realize those aspirations, and protections, such as home hardening or firefighting resources, that allow people to remain in place. As such, immobility in the face of wildfire destruction could reflect voluntary immobility of residents' desire to remain living in fire-prone places, but also may reflect certain populations being involuntarily "trapped", or, without sufficient capability or resources to move away. Observing immobility would be in line with prior studies of comparable sudden-onset hazards, and would correspond with the expectation of housing affordability constraints on out-migrationas well as environmental amenity pulls to remain in fire-affected places. The null hypothesis, therefore, is that no change in out- or in-migration will be observed in wildfire-affected areas relative to neighboring, unaffected areas.

In this work, we analyze the migration effects of the top 10% most destructive wildfires in the contiguous U.S. (N = 519) between 1999 and 2020. We construct a temporally and spatially harmonized dataset that combines data on wildfire-related structure loss with data on migration at the census tract scale, which are the most comparable spatial unit to neighborhoods. The structure loss data are from the U.S. National Incident Command System/Incident Status Summary Forms (hereafter "ICS"), linked to two sets of wildfire spatial burn footprints. Together, these data offer one of the most comprehensive and detailed data sources of wildfires and their impacts within the U.S. The migration data are based on the Federal Reserve Bank of New York/Equifax Consumer Credit Panel (CCP) and estimate the number of credit-visible residents whose address changes tracts between two adjacent quarters. The CCP is an anonymous random sample from the Equifax credit files which can be used to calculate quarterly estimates of the probability of in-migration to and out-migration from census tracts. These data allow us to investigate the effects of wildfire destruction on human migration, stratified by level of fire severity.

### Rare and highly destructive wildfires drive human migration in the U.S [^676ff9c4]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Our findings support our first hypothesis, that wildfires affect migration patterns non-linearly at high levels of structure loss, as housing and other infrastructure are destroyed, and residents subsequently relocate. We found that only a small portion of destructive wildfires caused a migratory response, and such rare events influenced mobility primarily through destruction to the built environment. Even among the top ten percent of the most destructive wildfires in the contiguous U.S. it was only the most extreme among these events that caused an increase in out-migration. This was reflected in significant wildfire effects on out-migration among wildfires in the most destructive portion of the top decile (258–7010 structures destroyed), and the largest magnitude of out-migration effects observed after the single most destructive event, the 2018 Camp Fire. Migration following highly destructive events is in keeping with prior research that has documented direct displacement following extreme sudden-onset disasters – and non-linear relationships between migration and hazard severity. It is also in line with emerging literature on wildfire-related mobility, which has documented temporary population displacement following two highly destructive events, the Mendocino Complex and Woolsey Fires in California. However, our research design ultimately does not allow us to distinguish between residents moving away because their own dwellings were destroyed, because their local environment experienced high levels of destruction, or a combination of both. These possible pathways should be investigated in future research with qualitative methods focused on migration decision-making.

### A transient self-assembling self-replicator [^f157aed3]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

While phase separation is a requirement for physical autocatalysis, why biphasic conditions are necessary for replicator destruction is less obvious, and both kinetic and thermodynamic factors may be at play. First, from the perspective of 3a, higher local concentrations of ruthenocarbenes in micelles of 3a would be expected than under homogeneous conditions, and this would facilitate the destruction of 3a. The effective equilibrium position may be altered between phase separated and homogenous conditions. For example, on destruction of 3a to form 4 and 2a, via 5, the phase separation of the extruded products might push the equilibrium towards increased consumption of 3a (Fig. 4). What is clear is that the phase separation both allows for micelle-mediated autocatalysis to occur and for the productive consumption of the self-replicator.

In conclusion, we have designed and operated a small molecule self-replicator whose formation is triggered by a physical autocatalytic reaction across a phase separation. In closed systems the maximum population of the self-assembled replicator is formed following a non-linear, far-from-equilibrium regime. The metastable self-assembled replicator is concurrently consumed, becomes depleted and moves towards thermodynamic equilibrium with the formation of a waste product. Addition of chemical fuel allows high replicator populations to be restored before the inevitable move toward equilibrium. Because formation and destruction of the self-replicator occur concurrently, the system is dynamic and allows temporal control of the self-replicator population. These studies demonstrate that for a small molecule self-replicator, a far-from-equilibrium population of replicators can be controlled in a fully synthetic system designed on first principles of chemical reactivity. Overall, the thermodynamic instability of the replicator enables the system to mimic two fundamental properties of living systems — the ability to self-replicate and persist far-from-equilibrium. Many living systems grosso modo are replicators working far-from-equilibrium, which are inevitably destroyed unless they are sustained. Study of dynamic metastable replicators may help to understand how to create minimal life in the laboratory, and provide physical models to study these fundamental properties outside of living systems.

### A chemically fuelled self-replicator [^3634d4db]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

The structures and functions of even the simplest living organisms seemingly operate counter to the maximisation of entropy and rely on the consumption of chemical energy to maintain dissipative states –. The behaviour of out-of-equilibrium biological systems has inspired many synthetic supramolecular materials and networks – and enabled function such as self-healing and adaptation in materials, controlled directional motion –, catalysis, primitive selection, and oscillatory behaviour –. However, although self-replication, under out-of-equilibrium regimes is indispensable to life, it is not well developed in synthetic systems.

Many synthetic small molecule template and supramolecular replicators have been developed with analogy to biological systems, demonstrating emergent traits such as heritabilityand selection. However, these replicators still invariably form thermodynamic (Fig. 1a) or kinetically trapped products (Fig. 1b) –.

Fig. 1
The dynamics of some known self-replicators. a Autocatalyst C, or self-replicator C, is a catalyst for its own formation and is thermodynamically stable. b Self-replicator C promotes its own formation from a dynamic library of building blocks and products via supramolecular interactions, forming a kinetically trapped set of replicators. c Self-replicator C is a catalyst for its own formation and is the kinetic product of the reaction. It is eventually destroyed to give thermodynamic, non-replicating, product D. d This work: A replicator C that is both formed and destroyed can be maintained, out-of-equilibrium, by a chemical fuel. The quantity of replicator (y) and survival time (x) are determined by the addition of fuel

Stable replicators (Fig. 1a), which are not subject to a destruction reaction, will move to equilibrium after the consumption of starting materials. Whilst kinetically trapped replicators are not at the thermodynamic minimum, they are also not in an energy-consuming, dissipative, out-of-equilibrium state (Fig. 1b). For example, macrocyclic disulfides within a dynamic combinatorial library, as developed by Otto, are formed autocatalytically via fibrous stacks, whose breakage and exposure of fibre ends leads to an increase in the macrocyclic building blocks (Fig. 1b). The final distribution of macrocycle replicators is static and explicitly shown to be a kinetically trapped state under the conditions of growth. No source of energy is required to maintain this distribution and it is not a dissipative out-of-equilibrium state.

Our study has several limitations that we anticipate can be addressed as future research continues to expand knowledge on wildfire-mobility dynamics. First, our study design did not identify residential moves within tracts. As a result, it is possible that wildfire destruction may cause changes to population mobility at a finer spatial scale than we were able to observe. Such a pattern would be in keeping with findings from a Colorado-based survey, in which residents in a fire-affected region who desired to move preferred nearby destinations. However, even if such within-tract residential mobility were taking place, it would still affirm our study's broader conclusion: residents by and large did not migrate out of fire-prone areas after less destructive events. Additionally, our aggregated census tract-level approach is not able to distinguish between individual residents whose dwellings were located within a burned tract but not within the burn footprint, and those whose dwellings were located directly within the burn footprint. Because some wildfires fall within a census tract but do not burn that tract's entire area, our approach necessarily included some unexposed residents in the treated condition. This may mean that our results underestimate the magnitude of migratory effects.

### A geometrical approach to control and controllability of nonlinear dynamical networks [^486189fe]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

What if the system is at an attractor that is deep in its basin and not close to the boundary? As our approach is based on parameter adjustment, such a case can still be effectively controlled in the sense that the system can be brought out of the attractor. For example, consider the attractor C for a 1 = 1.5 in the two-node GRN system, which is deep inside its own basin, as shown in Fig. 6c. When parameter perturbation is applied to the system, its energy landscape and basin structure are changed (from top to bottom). Under control, the attractor 'moves' towards the basin boundary and is destroyed when it reaches the boundary, thereby bringing the system out of this attractor. Another example is attractor A in Fig. 6c, where it can be seen that, when the control parameter a 1 increases its value from 0.9 to 1.5, its basin changes and the attractor moves towards the boundary as well. Similar plots but for fixed a 1 = 1.3 and different values of σ are shown in Fig. 6d. For a 1 = 1.3, the pseudo energy for A (the original valley at the lower-left corner) becomes higher, and the path for the transition from A to B becomes more pronounced. Further increasing a 1 towards the critical value (about 1.35) raises the energy of A to the level of the potential barrier, effectively eliminating the corresponding valley and the attractor itself. Note that, for a fixed value of a 1, increasing noise amplitude can lead to a mixture of cold colours, meaning that the valley range becomes wider and the ridge between two adjacent valleys becomes shallower, resulting in a higher transition probability for each attractor.

### Rare and highly destructive wildfires drive human migration in the U.S [^506a26f5]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

The scale of wildfire impacts to the built environment is growing and will likely continue under rising average global temperatures. We investigate whether and at what destruction threshold wildfires have influenced human mobility patterns by examining the migration effects of the most destructive wildfires in the contiguous U.S. between 1999 and 2020. We find that only the most extreme wildfires (258+ structures destroyed) influenced migration patterns. In contrast, the majority of wildfires examined were less destructive and did not cause significant changes to out- or in-migration. These findings suggest that, for the past two decades, the influence of wildfire on population mobility was rare and operated primarily through destruction of the built environment.

### The glucose measurement industry and hemoglobin A1c: an opportunity for creative destruction [^73cb5e3b]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2015). Low credibility.

The MyStar Extra self-monitoring blood glucose (SMBG) system provides moving estimates of the patient's hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c). There is a treasure trove of highly accurate glucose data available from highly accurate SMBG, CGM and FGM along with highly accurate HPLC HbA1c. If Nathan's criteria are used to select subjects whose glucoses can be correlated to the HbA1c, then algorithms can be developed for robustly transforming glucose into HbA1c. These algorithms can then be implemented in any SMBG or with the CGM and FGM software. This calculated HbA1c would even be accurate with Nathan's excluded population thus reducing the use of fructosamine and glycated protein. Finally, the developer of these new algorithms is advised to use a specific approach for testing her algorithm.

### Immune cell infiltration in the pancreas of type 1, type 2 and type 3c diabetes [^7d8d745d]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Immune infiltration in diabetes

Type 1 diabetes

With T1D having an autoimmune component, immune cell infiltration in islets, called insulitis, has been studied in rodent and human pancreata. Research in the non-obese diabetic (NOD) mouse, a well-characterized model of T1D presenting with immune cell infiltration, allows the investigation of cell infiltration over the development of the disease. Studies highlighted the recruitment of different immune cells in the pancreas starting with dendritic-like cell and macrophage infiltration in vessels adjacent to islets moving towards para- and peri-insular infiltration with increasing age of the mice. In a later stage, lymphocytes could be observed in the combination, the infiltration moved into islets and during these phases, β-cell destruction was observed. Additional studies showed that plasmacytoid dendritic cells are potent negative regulators of insulitis. Although differences between rodent models and man exist, many similarities provide the possibility to investigate disease development, longitudinal studies or intervention experiments.–

### Rare and highly destructive wildfires drive human migration in the U.S [^0f078e96]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

When we next examined wildfires in the more destructive portion of the decile (between 258 and 7010 structures destroyed), a migratory effect associated with structure loss was clearly evident. Among the more destructive portion of the top decile, there were four additional out-migrants per thousand residents, on average, during the event quarter, however this effect was only observed when using the 50-mile control set (Table 1, column C). The effect was more pronounced in the first year following the event, where we observed five and four additional out-migrants per thousand residents when using the 5-mile and 50-mile control sets respectively (Table 1, columns A and C). We did not observe any significant differences in out-migration the second year following the event, indicating that, during this period, migration trends returned to a similar trajectory as their neighboring control tracts.

### Updating visual space during motion in depth [^a44c9ac4]. Neuron (2005). Low credibility.

Whether we are riding in a car or walking, our internal map of the environment must be continuously updated to maintain spatial constancy. Using a memory eye movement task, we examined whether nonhuman primates can keep track of changes in the distance of nearby objects when moved toward or away from them. We report that memory-guided eye movements take into account the change in distance traveled, illustrating that monkeys can update retinal disparity information in order to reconstruct three-dimensional visual space during motion in depth. This ability was compromised after destruction of the vestibular labyrinths, suggesting that the extraretinal signals needed for updating can arise from vestibular information signaling self-motion through space.

Stratification of wildfires by severity

Given the right skew of the wildfire destruction distribution, we chose to analyze only the most destructive decile of wildfires that destroyed structures (hereafter, "top decile"). The top decile encompasses events ranging from fourteen structures destroyed at the least destructive to 18,804 structures destroyed at the most destructive. However, even this most destructive top decile itself is right skewed, with the majority of events causing a lower level of destruction. For this reason, we subsequently stratified the top decile into four sets for analysis: (1) the full decile distribution (n = 519), (2) the less destructive portion of the decile distribution (n = 463), (3) the more destructive portion of the decile distribution excluding the Camp Fire (n = 55), and (4) the most destructive event in the decile distribution, the Camp Fire (n = 1) (shown in Fig. 1b). We subdivided the top decile into these groups with the aid of Jenks natural breaks classification, which is a data classification method that minimizes variation within groups.

### Aging: the wound that never starts healing [^dfe10aec]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Briefly, an injury breaks structures such as blood vessels, nerves, skeletal elements, etc. which need to be "trimmed" beyond the immediate range of an injury by processes of histolysis and debridement. This is primarily done by secretion of molecules that break down tissue structures (histolysis) and a concomitant removal of damaged tissue elements and debris (debridement) by immune cells. Consequently, cells and tissue structures that are even moderately damaged are degraded in order to be rebuilt at the later stages of healing. As part of histolysis, but also throughout later phases, ECM is remodeled to make tissue more suitable for angiogenesis and cell migration. This process involves a complex interplay between enzymes that degrade ECM (e.g. proteases), their inhibitors, and the deposition of ECM components like collagen. The initial damage to the tissue followed by death of cells and lysis of the ECM, as well as invasion of microbes, results in the release of damage- and pathogen-associated molecular patterns, DAMPs and PAMPs, respectively. These molecules attract and activate immune cells that release pro-inflammatory molecules such as cytokines and eicosanoids. Cellular senescence, a cell cycle arrest-mediated hypersecretory phenotype, contributes to inflammation and ECM remodeling –. Changes in nutrient and oxygen availability, combined with the general shift of cellular phenotypes towards proliferation, secretion, and inflammation, result in metabolic remodeling and deposition of LDs. While mechanistically it is not yet clear which signaling pathways are causal to the induction of these phenotypes, the cell cycle inhibitor p21 dramatically alters the transcriptional landscape (via RB hypophosphorylation), affecting essentially all the aforementioned processes. After the clearance of damaged elements, DAMPs and PAMPs, the tissue proceeds towards the proliferation and remodeling phases. Below, several examples of tissue damage responses are discussed.

### Reply to polverino: clearing the air: innovations in imaging for early detection and management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^3e4bb7b2]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

From the Authors:

In the letter "Clearing the Air: Innovations in Imaging for Early Detection and Management of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease", Polverino postulates the existence of two different spans in the pathophysiology of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD): one going from pre-COPD to Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) II and a second leading to the final phases of COPD. Although the pathophysiology of pre-COPD remains elusive at the moment, we indeed demonstrated in our paper in the recent issue of the Journal that small airway loss and alveolar destruction were equally present in patients with pre-COPD and early-stage COPD, whereas an additional decline was seen in patients with GOLD III/IV only, corroborating this hypothesis. However, three different spans seems more realistic, in which the initial step is emphysema development and small airway loss moving from "healthy smoker" to pre-COPD. A second step is the development of an obstructive pulmonary function defect moving from pre-COPD to COPD GOLD I/II. A final progression to GOLD III/IV is then associated with more alveolar and small airway destruction. Further investigation of the immune responses in pre-COPD in relation to established COPD GOLD I/II forms another crucial aspect next to this parenchymal and small airway destruction. This is crucial to unravel whether (lymphoid) inflammation is equally present in pre-COPD compared with patients with established COPD and to assess which stepwise pattern can be observed in the underlying immune responses. Based on existing data, the stepwise pattern to GOLD I/II and to GOLDIII/IV seems a plausible hypothesis, as only small differences in inflammatory and remodeling markers are found on histology in COPD GOLD I and II and much more pronounced differences in GOLD III and IV compared with never-smokers and smoking control subjects, although no data currently exist on pre-COPD.

### Matrix metalloproteinases and their tissue inhibitors direct cell fate during cancer development [^0eed0f46]. British Journal of Cancer (2003). Low credibility.

While it is established that MMPs degrade ECM proteins and therefore allow for cell migration, MMPs can also affect cell regulatory signals, directly or indirectly, within the extracellular microenvironment that impact intracellular signalling. In this review, we discuss how the proteolytic axis constituted by MMPs/TIMPs/ADAMs influences the basic cellular processes that underlie cancer development, namely cell dissociation, death, and division – the three D's of tumorigenesis.

### On the decline of biodiversity due to area loss [^b00034f7]. Nature Communications (2015). Medium credibility.

Extinction curves: species richness (E)

We explored three scenarios of habitable area loss: inward, outward and scattered random. We adopted a strictly nested sampling designto explore the effects of inward and outward scenario (Fig. 1). We considered sampling windows of sides l and area A in = A cell × l 2, whereand 1 ≤ l ≤ 20. We started with the smallest sampling window (l = 1) and with the largest area outside of the sampling window (A out = A tot − A in). We moved the sampling window continually across the 20 × 20 regional grid, and for each position, we recorded number of species with ranges exclusively within (E in) and number of species with ranges exclusively outside of (E out) the sampling window. We calculated meanandby averaging E in and E out values across all of the possible positions of the sampling window. We then enlarged the side of the sampling window to l = 2 and we repeated the procedure described above. We continued enlarging the window until l reached 20 and A in = A tot, calculating meanandfor each of the window areas. We then plotted the proportionsagainst A in / A tot (these are the red EAR in curves in Figs 1 and 4 representing the outward destruction) andagainst A out / A tot (these are the blue EAR out curves in Figs 1 and 4 that represent the inward destruction).

In the scattered random destruction scenario, we selected the grid cells for the sampling one by one. The area within the set of selected cells was A in, and the richness of species endemic to that area was E in. In each step, each grid cell within the remaining area (A tot − A in) had the same probability of being selected for the destruction. We repeated this procedure 400 times and averaged the resulting extinction curves to get EAR in and EAR out.

### Caspase activation-stepping on the gas or releasing the brakes? Lessons from humans and flies [^d96605b8]. Oncogene (2004). Low credibility.

The central components of the execution phase of apoptosis in worms, flies, and humans are members of the caspase protease family. Work in Drosophila and mammalian systems has revealed a web of interactions that govern the activity of these proteases, and two fundamental control points have been identified. These are zymogen activation - the process that converts a latent caspase into its active form, and inhibition of the resulting active protease. In humans, the driving force for caspase activity is activation of the zymogens, but in Drosophila, a major thrust is derepression of caspase inhibitors. In this review, we consider evidence for these two distinct events in terms of the regulation of caspase activity. This sets the scene for therapy to reinstate the normal death mechanisms that have been overcome in a cancer cell's quest for immortality.

### A multifunctional therapy approach for cancer: targeting raf1-mediated inhibition of cell motility, growth, and interaction with the microenvironment [^aeba31e8]. Molecular Cancer Therapeutics (2020). Medium credibility.

Prostate cancer cells move from their primary site of origin, interact with a distant microenvironment, grow, and thereby cause death. It had heretofore not been possible to selectively inhibit cancer cell motility. Our group has recently shown that inhibition of intracellular activation of Raf1 with the small-molecule therapeutic KBU2046 permits, for the first time, selective inhibition of cell motility. We hypothesized that simultaneous disruption of multiple distinct functions that drive progression of prostate cancer to induce death would result in advanced disease control. Using a murine orthotopic implantation model of human prostate cancer metastasis, we demonstrate that combined treatment with KBU2046 and docetaxel retains docetaxel's antitumor action, but provides improved inhibition of metastasis, compared with monotherapy. KBU2046 does not interfere with hormone therapy, inclusive of enzalutamide-mediated inhibition of androgen receptor (AR) function and cell growth inhibition, and inclusive of the ability of castration to inhibit LNCaP-AR cell outgrowth in mice. Cell movement is necessary for osteoclast-mediated bone degradation. KBU2046 inhibits Raf1 and its downstream activation of MEK1/2 and ERK1/2 in osteoclasts, inhibiting cytoskeleton rearrangement, resorptive cavity formation, and bone destruction in vitro, with improved effects observed when the bone microenvironment is chemically modified by pretreatment with zoledronic acid. Using a murine cardiac injection model of human prostate cancer bone destruction quantified by CT, KBU2046 plus zoledronic exhibit improved inhibitory efficacy, compared with monotherapy. The combined disruption of pathways that drive cell movement, interaction with bone, and growth constitutes a multifunctional targeting strategy that provides advanced disease control.

### Rare and highly destructive wildfires drive human migration in the U.S [^6818ec8f]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Prior environmental migration scholarship conducted across hazard types finds broad variability in the direction and magnitude of migration response. We showed that, further, the migration response to the same hazard can vary widely across severity levels, increasing non-linearly at the highest level of impact. Our findings speak to the outsized effects of the most extreme environmental events on human migration. Fires are a common environmental phenomenon occurring across many parts of the U.S. (Fig. 1); it is only a much smaller subset of rare, but extremely destructive wildfires that have directly impacted migration through structure loss. This finding is important for situating a general understanding of wildfire-related mobility in the contiguous U.S. – namely, that immobility is the most common response to destructive wildfires. Climate mobility scholars have recently begun emphasizing such findings that have historically been treated as null results of lesser interest, arguing for the importance of studying immobility, especially in the context of intensifying environmental hazards. Future research should investigate how both individual aspirations and macro-level structural conditions collectively inform the mobility of residents living in fire-prone places.

While we observed immobility as the most common response to destructive wildfires, we also know that the rate of wildfire-driven structure loss in the U.S. has been increasing over time, with a substantial number of outlying extreme events occurring in recent years (Fig. 1). Absent major adaptation efforts, if the recent intensification of wildfire destructiveness continues, our findings suggest that we may expect to observe more direct displacement caused by extreme wildfires in the future. Although we did not observe substantial evidence of indirect wildfire-mobility effects, in which residents began leaving or avoided moving into fire-affected regions absent major structure loss, these effects may yet emerge in the future as the wildfire regime continues to change. Future research should examine how these pathways of wildfire-related migration evolve. Additionally, research in this area could examine whether more recent extreme events and events outside of the contiguous U.S. such as the 2023 Maui Fire in Hawaii, have similar migration effects as those found in this analysis.

### Development of an emergency plan for in vitro fertilization programs: a committee opinion [^e6df8fb7]. Fertility and Sterility (2021). High credibility.

In vitro fertilization (IVF) emergency planning — management of cryopreserved oocytes, sperm, and embryos states that "Reasonable efforts should be made to maintain a stable cryoenvironment for cryopreserved oocytes, embryos, sperm, and other human specimens". Duplicate ownership records "should be kept at a site separate" and "attempts should be made to keep duplicate records at a remote location or on a secure web server". With prior warning, "liquid nitrogen tanks containing the reproductive specimens should be topped-off and moved to an alternative location, if necessary". If specimens are moved, "an attempt should be made to notify appropriate personnel", and "the new location should be secured and the tanks marked appropriately so that they can be easily identified by nonmedical personnel (e.g., fire, police)". Authorities "should be notified that human specimens are stored at the clinic site" and destinations for different disasters determined, with signage in the storage area "specifying the location to which tanks are to be moved, the persons who are to be notified about the move, and the location of the duplicate identification records". After the emergency, "efforts should be made to replenish the liquid nitrogen", recognizing that obtaining liquid nitrogen "may not be possible". If off-site for a prolonged period, "reasonable and timely efforts should be made to notify patients", communicate and document any compromise or destruction, and document contact attempts. Informed consent "should include a statement" that the clinic will make efforts but "cannot be held responsible for the loss of viability due to natural disasters or other emergencies beyond the control of the clinic", and it "should indicate that the patient will be informed if their specimen is moved to an alternate location long-term because of an emergency situation".

### Alarmin (g) the innate immune system to invasive fungal infections [^f62e014f]. Current Opinion in Microbiology (2016). Low credibility.

Fungi encounter numerous stresses in a mammalian host, including the immune system, which they must adapt to in order to grow and cause disease. The host immune system tunes its response to the threat level posed by the invading pathogen. We discuss recent findings on how interleukin (IL)-1 signaling is central to tuning the immune response to the virulence potential of invasive fungi, as well as other pathogens. Moreover, we discuss fungal factors that may drive tissue invasion and destruction that regulate IL-1 cytokine release. Moving forward understanding the mechanisms of fungal adaption to the host, together with understanding how the host innate immune system recognizes invading fungal pathogens will increase our therapeutic options for treatment of invasive fungal infections.

### Programmed cell removal: a new obstacle in the road to developing cancer [^b8cc07b1]. Nature Reviews: Cancer (2011). Medium credibility.

The development of cancer involves mechanisms by which aberrant cells overcome normal regulatory pathways that limit their numbers and their migration. The evasion of programmed cell death is one of several key early events that need to be overcome in the progression from normal cellular homeostasis to malignant transformation. Recently, we provided evidence in mouse and human cancers that successful cancer clones must also overcome programmed cell removal. In this Opinion article, we explore the role of programmed cell removal in both normal and neoplastic cells, and we place this pathway in the context of the initiation of programmed cell death.

### Gasdermin E dictates inflammatory responses by controlling the mode of neutrophil death [^a7e8e410]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Neutrophils - terminally differentiated cells with a very short life-span (7–20 h) - are continuously generated in the bone marrow (BM) through tightly regulated granulopoiesis. About 10 11 neutrophils are produced every day and a similar number undergo programmed cell death (PCD), keeping their number constant under normal conditions –. Neutrophil PCD is also critical for modulating neutrophil number and accumulation at sites of infection and inflammation. Neutrophils die even in the absence of extracellular stimuli and independent of pathogen invasion, which is therefore known as constitutive or spontaneous neutrophil death –. It is well documented that neutrophil death is a key component in innate immune regulation (and references therein).

PCD, which can be lytic or non-lytic, describes a tightly regulated form of cellular suicide essential in many pathophysiological processes. Apoptosis is a non-lytic and anti-inflammatory PCD, as cellular components are sequestered into apoptotic bodies that prevent the release of proinflammatory constituents. Necroptosis, pyroptosis and PANoptosis are lytic forms of PCD that release pro-inflammatory substrates such as damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), ultimately amplifying inflammation –. Neutrophils die by both anti-inflammatory apoptosis and pro-inflammatory lytic cell death. During inflammation, apoptotic neutrophils are quickly recognized, engulfed, and cleared by macrophages via a highly regulated process known as efferocytosis, which triggers anti-inflammatory cytokine production that facilitates the resolution of inflammation –. While this timely clearance of apoptotic neutrophils prevents a cascade of further inflammation, it also helps to clear pathogens that have been engulfed but not cleared by these neutrophils. Neutrophil PCD is therefore heterogeneous, but the underlying mechanisms dictating the type of cell death remain uncertain, even though understanding these mechanisms is important for resolving or controlling inflammation in inflammatory diseases.

Intravenous (IV) contrast artifacts and corrections — For apex–endocardial border "swirling", use "real-time very low MI imaging" and "increase contrast infusion rate", noting that a "lower frame rate prevents apical destruction" and the focus can be moved "to near field". For apex–myocardium "reduced contrast", "increase near-field TGC under resting conditions; move focus temporarily to near field", and if "resting wall motion is normal", a defect "is an artifact". For left ventricular (LV) cavity contrast that is "inadequate using a continuous infusion", "check IV site to ensure not obstructed; increase infusion rate; ensure contrast is not too dilute and is staying adequately mixed", or "could switch to a small bolus". For LV cavity "shadowing of basal/mid segments", "slow down infusion or reduce bolus size and flush rate", and "infusion (compared with bolus) reduces shadowing problems and allows more rapid correction of the problem".

### How dying cells alert the immune system to danger [^359b9808]. Nature Reviews: Immunology (2008). Medium credibility.

When a cell dies in vivo, the event does not go unnoticed. The host has evolved mechanisms to detect the death of cells and rapidly investigate the nature of their demise. If cell death is a result of natural causes - that is, it is part of normal physiological processes - then there is little threat to the organism. In this situation, little else is done other than to remove the corpse. However, if cells have died as the consequence of some violence or disease, then both defence and repair mechanisms are mobilized in the host. The importance of these processes to host defence and disease pathogenesis has only been appreciated relatively recently. This article reviews our current knowledge of these processes.

### Invisible steps for a global endemy: molecular strategies adopted by… [^2cf287fa]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Intracellular effects of Tcds

After binding to the cell membrane, the Tcds stimulate their internalization by an endocytic vacuole in which pH decrease favours a conformational change of the Tcds itself. This allows the Tcds to insert the catalytic domain outside the membrane for cleavage, and thus activate the glycosylation process of the catalytic site of Rho-GTPase to inhibit its activity. – This inhibition causes several biological consequences such as cytoskeleton disruption,– cell cycle arrest,– and cell death, which occurs after cycle arrest.– These phenomena are strictly dependent on the dose of Tcds, wherein at high concentration, cell death occurs by necrosis.

It is essential to understand what the molecular strategy underlying cytoskeleton alterations and cell cycle arrest is. All immune cells that reach the replication area of the C. difficile vegetative form possess intrinsic motility; therefore, their immobilisation drastically decreases their functional effectiveness. – Moreover, the intracellular action of Tcds in these immune cells modifies the cytokine secretion pattern, which is shifted toward a greater production of proinflammatory cytokines such as IFN-γ and TNF-α,– and anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-10. Cytoskeletal alterations are an early event (appearing in some cells after 30 min) that cause cell rounding in most cell types in vitro with cell detachment; whereas, in vivo there is retraction of colonocytes and cells of the basal membrane, which allows the more in-depth penetration of C. difficile and contributes to the making of a highly inflammatory setting that stimulates expulsion in the external environment by diarrhoea.

### Guidelines for performance, interpretation, and application of stress echocardiography in ischemic heart disease: from the American Society of Echocardiography [^cd820107]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2020). High credibility.

Stress echocardiography — left ventricular opacification (LVO) ultrasound enhancing agent (UEA) setup specifies harmonic B‑mode with MI < 0.3, < 70% gain and frame rate 20–30 Hz, using UEA boluses 0.1 mL IV Definity, 0.2–0.4 mL IV Optison, or 0.5–1.0 mL IV Lumason, or infusions 3–5% Definity and 10% Optison/Lumason; lower frame rate prevents apical destruction and focus can be moved to near field. Very low MI imaging uses MI < 0.2 with pulse sequence schemes and MI 0.8–1.0 flashes to clear myocardial contrast and improve border delineation with focus at the mitral valve plane; use < 70% gain and frame rate 20–25 Hz with the same UEA dosing, and with very low MI pulse sequence schemes myocardial contrast can be cleared with high 0.8–1.0 MI "flash" impulses (5–10 frames) with lower doses and overall gain settings at peak stress. Each bolus should be followed by a 5–10 mL IV saline flush administered over 20 seconds.

### A blast from the past: clearance of apoptotic cells regulates immune responses [^b14cd9c7]. Nature Reviews: Immunology (2002). Medium credibility.

Apoptosis, which is a programmed and physiological form of cell death, is known to shape the immune system by regulating populations of effector lymphocytes. However, the binding and ingestion of dying cells by monocytes/macrophages and dendritic cells can also influence immune responses markedly by enhancing or suppressing inflammation. Therefore, dead cells, which are a reflection of an organism's immediate past, can control its immunological future.

### Stem cell-based treatments for type 1 diabetes mellitus: bone marrow, embryonic, hepatic, pancreatic and induced pluripotent stem cells [^e274e49f]. Diabetic Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Type 1 diabetes mellitus — characterized by the permanent destruction of insulin-secreting β-cells — is responsive to cell-based treatments that replace lost β-cell populations. The current gold standard of pancreas transplantation provides only temporary independence from exogenous insulin and is fraught with complications, including increased mortality. Stem cells offer a number of theoretical advantages over current therapies. Our review will focus on the development of treatments involving tissue stem cells from bone marrow, liver and pancreatic cells, as well as the potential use of embryonic and induced pluripotent stem cells for Type 1 diabetes therapy. While the body of research involving stem cells is at once promising and inconsistent, bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cell transplantation seems to offer the most compelling evidence of efficacy. These cells have been demonstrated to increase endogenous insulin production, while partially mitigating the autoimmune destruction of newly formed β-cells. However, recently successful experiments involving induced pluripotent stem cells could quickly move them into the foreground of therapeutic research. We address the limitations encountered by present research and look toward the future of stem cell treatments for Type 1 diabetes.

### B cells in multiple sclerosis: connecting the dots [^b1c66e2d]. Current Opinion in Immunology (2011). Low credibility.

Over the past two decades B cells have increasingly moved into the spotlight in multiple sclerosis (MS) research. This interest was fuelled by growing understanding and acceptance of pathological involvement of B cells and antibodies in MS. Data derived from animal models of MS, human histopathological studies, and analyses of B cells in the peripheral blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) have permitted the integration of B cells in our overall picture of MS immunopathogenesis. The as yet strongest direct evidence for a central role of B cells in MS autoimmunity was the demonstration that peripheral B cell depletion leads to a rapid decline of disease-activity in MS. While lending formidable impact to peripheral blood B cells as mediators of disease activity, the effects of anti-CD20 treatment also seemingly challenged the paradigm of a role of antibodies in targeted central nervous system (CNS) myelin destruction. This review shall attempt to provide an overview of our current understanding of B cell and antibody mediated mechanisms relevant to MS. We will include findings from, both, human studies, and animal models to highlight the complexity of B cell function as it pertains to MS. B cells appear to be effective drivers of inflammatory activity in MS by way of a diverse toolset of cellular functions. These functions appear to be closely linked to B cells that can be found in the periphery. However, by serving as the source of antibodies, B cells offer a direct humoral response that may target the CNS and lead to tissue specific destruction. Therefore, B cells participate in MS pathogenesis on both sides of the blood-brain barrier.

### Apoptosis: a basic biological phenomenon with wide-ranging implications in human disease [^2f7a7e50]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Apoptosis is a highly regulated process of cell deletion and plays a fundamental role in the maintenance of tissue homeostasis in the adult organism. Numerous studies in recent years have revealed that apoptosis is a constitutive suicide programme expressed in most, if not all cells, and can be triggered by a variety of extrinsic and intrinsic signals. Many human diseases can be attributed directly or indirectly to a derangement of apoptosis, resulting in either cell accumulation, in which cell eradication or cell turnover is impaired, or cell loss, in which the apoptotic programme is inadvertently triggered. In addition, defective macrophage engulfment and degradation of cell corpses may also contribute to a dysregulation of tissue homeostasis. An increased understanding of the signalling pathways that govern the execution of apoptosis and the subsequent clearance of dying cells may thus yield novel targets for therapeutic intervention in a wide range of human maladies.

### Apoptotic cell clearance: basic biology and therapeutic potential [^ded16da3]. Nature Reviews: Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

The prompt removal of apoptotic cells by phagocytes is important for maintaining tissue homeostasis. The molecular and cellular events that underpin apoptotic cell recognition and uptake, and the subsequent biological responses, are increasingly better defined. The detection and disposal of apoptotic cells generally promote an anti-inflammatory response at the tissue level, as well as immunological tolerance. Consequently, defects in apoptotic cell clearance have been linked with various inflammatory diseases and autoimmunity. Conversely, under certain conditions, such as the killing of tumour cells by specific cell-death inducers, the recognition of apoptotic tumour cells can promote an immunogenic response and antitumour immunity. Here, we review the current understanding of the complex process of apoptotic cell clearance in physiology and pathology, and discuss how this knowledge could be harnessed for new therapeutic strategies.

As adolescents, girls show more hostility and boys are less hostile when they moved as children with the custodial father.

### Floods and cause-specific mortality in the UK: a nested case-control study [^d0b7891e]. BMC Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

The limitations merit consideration. Our participants were residents in the UK who were more likely to live in less socioeconomically deprived areas, therefore, our results may not be generalizable to a whole population, especially people in low- and middle-income countries. Like most of cohort studies, covariates were collected at enrolment in the biobank. Due to the limited information on behavioural changes after the baseline examinations, we are unable to exclude the effect of behavioural changes on the risk estimates. However, most of the covariates (e.g. socio-economic status) were considered as effect modifiers rather than confounders, therefore, any changes in these factors should not have a substantial impact on our estimates. While the flood index accounts for cumulative exposure, it does not yet capture the potential differential impacts of distinct flood phases (warning, event, post-event) on mortality. Further research with a short-term design would be helpful to investigate the impacts of distinct flood phases. The destructive power of floods can differ based on factors like terrain, altitude, water management, drainage, urbanization, and building design. Therefore, a single severity label for an entire flood event may not fully capture the nuances of varying local experiences. Further research is needed to refine our exposure assessment as more detailed data becomes available. Lastly, it is likely for people to move after flooding exposure, with or without moving back into their homes. We assumed that participants did not move, which may have underestimated the effect of floods if an individual moved from an area with a high risk of flooding to an area with a lower risk of flooding. However, exposure to flooding can still have a long-term impact on them due to potential property damage and financial loss, even if people relocate to areas with a low risk of flooding in the aftermath of the event.

### Tumour immunity: effector response to tumour and role of the microenvironment [^304fc294]. Lancet (2008). Excellent credibility.

Substantial evidence shows that inflammation promotes oncogenesis and, occasionally, participates in cancer rejection. This paradox can be accounted for by a dynamic switch from chronic smouldering inflammation promoting cancer-cell survival to florid, tissue-disruptive inflammatory reactions that trigger cancer-cell destruction. Clinical and experimental observations suggest that the mechanism of this switch recapitulates the events associated with pathogen infection, which stimulate immune cells to recognise danger signals and activate immune effector functions. Generally, cancers do not have danger signals and, therefore, they cannot elicit strong immune reactions. Synthetic molecules have been developed that mimic pathogen invasion at the tumour site. These compounds activate dendritic cells to produce proinflammatory cytokines, which in turn trigger cytotoxic mechanisms leading to cancer death. Simultaneously, dendritic cells capture antigen shed by dying cancer cells, undergo activation, and stimulate antigen-specific T and B cells. This process results in massive amplification of the antineoplastic inflammatory process. Thus, although anti-inflammatory drugs can prevent onset of some malignant diseases, induction of T cells specific for tumour antigen by active immunisation, combined with powerful activation signals within the cancer microenvironment, might yield the best strategy for treatment of established cancers.

### Atherosclerotic plaque destabilization: mechanisms, models, and therapeutic strategies [^02df00b7]. Circulation Research (2014). Low credibility.

Understanding the pathophysiology of atherogenesis and the progression of atherosclerosis have been major goals of cardiovascular research during the previous decades. However, the complex molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying plaque destabilization remain largely obscure. Here, we review how lesional cells undergo cell death and how failed clearance exacerbates necrotic core formation. Advanced atherosclerotic lesions are further weakened by the pronounced local activity of matrix-degrading proteases as well as immature neovessels sprouting into the lesion. To stimulate translation of the current knowledge of molecular mechanisms of plaque destabilization into clinical studies, we further summarize available animal models of plaque destabilization. Based on the molecular mechanisms leading to plaque instability, we outline the current status of clinical and preclinical trials to induce plaque stability with a focus on induction of dead cell clearance, inhibition of protease activity, and dampening of inflammatory cell recruitment.

### Unraveling the intricacies of osteoclast differentiation and maturation: insight into novel therapeutic strategies for bone-destructive diseases [^8e1abdb5]. Experimental & Molecular Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Skeletal bone is maintained by bone remodeling, in which old and damaged bone is replaced with new bone through continuous cellular processes that are mainly controlled by bone-resorbing osteoclasts and bone-forming osteoblasts. During bone remodeling, osteoclast formation is initiated, and a tiny amount of bone is removed, which is then replaced by new bone formed by osteoblasts; after that, the new bone is mineralized. Bone remodeling takes place at sites known as basic multicellular units, which contain all bone cells, including osteoclasts and osteoblasts, and are asynchronously distributed throughout the skeleton. Osteoblast-osteoclast interactions are necessary and must be coordinated in time and space to maintain the balance of focal bone remodeling. The communication mechanism by which bone formation follows bone resorption is known as coupling. Researchers have discovered several coupling mechanisms, such as (1) the release of osteoblast precursor recruitment factors and growth-promoting factors, which are stored in large amounts in the bone matrix through osteoclastic bone resorption –; (2) the secretion of coupling factors by osteoclasts –; (3) the expression of coupling factors on the osteoclast cell membrane –; and (4) the production of extracellular vesicles, which contain coupling factors synthesized by osteoclasts. Through these mechanisms, osteoclasts signal osteoblast precursors to prepare for bone formation. A functional imbalance in osteoclasts and osteoblasts unbalances coupling, causing abnormal bone homeostasis.

### Do as I say or die: compliance in adolescents with cancer [^6f6501d3]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2008). Low credibility.

Adolescence is a time of great physical change and maturing brain function. This leads to adolescents establishing independence and coming to terms with the implications of their own actions. Not surprisingly, this phase is characterized by experimentation with both constructive and destructive behavior. Studies in many areas of chronic illness have shown that adolescents frequently neglect their care and revolt against the rules established during their childhood. It is therefore to be expected that teenagers diagnosed with a life threatening illness, such as cancer, may on occasion not fully comply with their therapy. The way forward includes improving communication and fully involving these young persons in their treatment planning, thereby moving from compliance to concordance. Additional improvements should be sought in medication, early recognition and support of familial or social problems, and using a specific adolescent multidisciplinary team. Research should not be limited to clinical trials.

### Synchronization in collectively moving inanimate and living active matter [^c5da4aab]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Collective motion is sensitive to uncooperative individuals

We next investigated mechanisms to destabilize the ordered state or to prevent it from arising. We probed this by continuously increasing the number of balls collectively moving within a confinement (D = 0.9 m). After reaching a critical number of agents (N = 82) in the confinement, the ordered motion of the now densely packed population became unstable, transitioned to the disordered state and the ordered state did not re-emerge. The transition to disorder corresponded to a sudden drop in the angular order parameter (Fig. 5a, Supplementary Movie 5). This would suggest that the destabilization is caused by the increased density of balls in the system. However, when the population of balls was preselected to have matching natural frequencies to avoid variability within the collective, the ordered state still emerged in close to fully packed confinements (Supplementary Movie 5). This indicated that the stability of the ordered state depended on the distribution of frequencies rather than the density of the population.

Fig. 5
Destabilizing the order in both systems.

a We approached the critical number of agents at n = 82 by incrementally increasing the number of balls in a circular confinement (D = 0.9 m). Top: Representative trajectories are displayed for both states over an equal time interval of 2 s. They show the transition from a collectively moving state to a Brownian-like motion. Bottom: The steady states' angular order parameter fluctuates close to unity for a representative time interval of Δt = 25 s. The transition to disorder is evident by the sudden decrease in the angular order parameter when reaching a critical number of agents within the confinement. b Consecutively rendering 4% of the population of balls inactive leads to the breakdown of the order (3 inactive balls within a collective of 73 balls). c Partially inactivating actin polymerization in a subpopulation of cells prevents order from arising (n = 12) (Mean ± SD).

### ACR-ASNR-SIR practice parameter for the performance of non-breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) guided procedures [^1290d67f]. SIR/ACR/ASNR (2025). High credibility.

Minimally invasive percutaneous procedures — whenever feasible, minimally invasive approaches are preferred over other surgical procedures because of advantages that include decreased morbidity and mortality, decreased length of hospitalization and expense, and the potential for treatment or cure for patients who are not open surgical candidates. Thermal tumor ablation under MRI provides ablation monitoring over and above precise targeting as MRI temperature mapping provides real-time guidance for deposition of thermal energy (MR thermometry), and precise millimeter visualization of the cryoablation ice edge is especially important near critical structures. Through MRI monitoring, ablation zone size/volume and configuration can be directly controlled by the operator and adjusted during the procedure to compensate for deviations from preoperative predictions and to define the treatment endpoint without moving the patient from the operative or MRI suite. This capability not only permits accurate tumor destruction, including the margins, but also extends the application of radiofrequency (RF), cryoablation, focused US, and other ablation techniques to safe destruction of tumor within visceral organs and adjacent to vital neurovascular structures; interactive MRI can be used to guide and monitor tumor ablation with various sources of thermal energy.

### Neutrophil trafficking to lymphoid tissues: physiological and pathological implications [^f2197859]. The Journal of Pathology (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Neutrophils are short‐lived immune cells that are commonly accepted as being the first leucocyte sub‐type to be recruited in large numbers from the blood circulation into inflamed tissues. Their migration through the cellular and matrix components of blood vessel walls is a tightly regulated process involving intricate cellular and molecular interactions, as summarised in recent articles 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. This phenomenon is fundamental for an effective innate immune response against infections or acute injury, providing a host defence mechanism that clears tissues of invading pathogens, dead cells and potentially harmful debris. Neutrophil diapedesis also plays an important role in regulating the phenotype and activation state of emigrated neutrophils at sites of inflammation 7. Key effector functions of neutrophils include phagocytosis and killing of intracellular or extracellular pathogens, tissue remodelling and secretion of chemotactic and immunomodulatory molecules that can further regulate the recruitment and activation of other pro‐inflammatory leucocytes 8, 9, 10, 11. To facilitate these functions, activated neutrophils can also release a wide range of granular proteases and cytotoxic factors, as well as generate a host of reactive oxygen species. Whilst such capabilities are essential armoury for destroying microorganisms, they can also cause collateral damage to host tissues, rendering clearance of apoptotic neutrophils an essential component of resolving an inflammatory response 12, 13. Another form of cell death program for neutrophils is via NETosis, a dynamic process associated with the generation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) 14, 15, 16. NETs are generated through the release of decondensed chromatin and granular enzymes into the extracellular space surrounding leucocytes as means of controlling the dissemination of infectious microorganisms 14, 17, 18. Whilst the role of NETs in the direct killing of pathogens remains contentious 14, 19, 20, there is strong evidence to indicate that the formation of NETs in vivo can be detrimental to the host. Pathological induction of NETs, such as that induced under conditions of sterile injury (e.g. ischemia/reperfusion injury) can also cause tissue damage and indeed NETosis has been implicated to the pathogenesis of a wide range of non‐infectious inflammatory disorders 21, 22, 23, 24. Collectively, excessive recruitment, activation and/or inefficient clearance of infiltrated neutrophils is now categorically associated with the development of numerous acute pathological conditions such as myocardial infarction, stroke and tissue damage caused by ischemic insults 22, 25, 26 and there is now a growing interest in the pathogenic potential of neutrophils in chronic conditions such as cancer 27, 28, 29. Furthermore, the association of neutrophils with multiple autoimmune disorders (e.g. RA, lupus, multiple sclerosis, Crohn's disease and vasculitis) 21, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34 has invigorated the interest in neutrophils as potential players in regulation of adaptive immunity.

### Cochaperones convey the energy of ATP hydrolysis for directional action of hsp90 [^e969fab9]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

If that holds true for all edges, the populations of all states involved remain constant and are unchanged over time (stationary).

If there are more than two states, another possibility for stationary (constant) state populations is possible: steady state. In this case, e.g. more transitions occur from state 0 to state 1 than vice versa in a certain time. Those unequal forwards and backwards amounts are countered by transitions to other states of the cyclic system, allowing the population sizes of the states to stay the same. In our example (Fig. 1), we observe the binding and unbinding of three proteins X, Y, and Z. Initially, all proteins are unbound (state 0). When proteins X and Y bind, their subassembly corresponds to state 1. The resulting final complex XYZ of all three proteins corresponds to state 2. It eventually falls apart again, causing the system to return to state 0. If the system was in detailed balance (Fig. 1a), equal amounts of complexes would form and disassemble in each step. The system would be in thermodynamic equilibrium. However, with an energy source like ATP present, a succession of states could occur. In this scenario (Fig. 1b), the complex formation would be directed and a net flux through the cycle could be observed, with all forward amounts being larger than their backwards amounts. The state populations would still remain stationary (constant) but the system would be in a steady state. In a cellular environment, all states are populated, and a directed cycle allows for the recycling of proteins. Steady-state and detailed balance can only be clearly distinguished with single-molecule experiments because, from an ensemble view, all state populations stay constant in both cases. Another possibility to introduce directionality would be the successive binding of proteins by utilizing the energy of binding. However, this can never lead to a cycle as for every forward transition, a new protein would have to be synthesized to be pristine for binding. In the end, the very stable complex would have to be degraded because it constitutes the energy minimum of the binding process. This single-use of proteins would result in a huge energy cost and is therefore very unlikely.

### APA guidelines for psychological practice with military service members, veterans, and their families [^3311ee53]. APA (2021). High credibility.

Guideline 4.2 — understanding effects of military status and deployment on SMVF states that psychologists strive to understand the effects of military status and of deployment on SMVF. Rationale describes that even during peacetime, military families contend with stressors that differ from those of civilian families, including more frequent geographic moves (including possible international moves), interruption of children's peer relationships, and living with the threat of injury or death of the military service member because of dangerous duty; the average child of a military service member moves six to nine times between kindergarten and the end of high school, and children may also have to deal with multiple separations from and reunions with their loved one. Recent geographic moves in military families have been associated with increased mental health visits in children and adolescents, and stressors include periods of separation from the military spouse, moving to a foreign country linked to poorer physical and psychological well-being, and fear for the service member's risk for injury or death. The document also notes beneficial effects, including increased capacity for flexibility, resiliency, and a sense of meaning and purpose, and that psychologists are encouraged to consider and understand both the potential positive and negative outcomes of the military lifestyle; deployment can create additional stress on families.

### Rejuvenation as the origin of planar defects in the CrCoNi medium entropy alloy [^91730366]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Paradoxically, as the degree of SRO reduces, the system will reach a higher energy state. This state has a lower SF energy which is intrinsically more ductile. In this vein, the destruction of SRO in HEAs/MEAs can be considered a form of rejuvenation (see Supplementary Fig. 1), which has been widely discussed as a beneficial structural transition in disordered materials such as bulk-metallic glasses (BMGs). When BMG is rejuvenated, the structure exhibits a lower degree of ordering and a higher energy state than its relaxed counterparts, resulting in enhanced ductility and toughness. In the CrCoNi MEA system, Li et al. predicted that it only takes three Burgers vectors of dislocation glide to destroy the SRO completely using MD simulations. Therefore, it is expected that the collective movements of dislocations can randomize the atomic arrangement and rejuvenate the system, increasing the propensity of long and stable SFs in HEAs/MEAs due to a lower SF energy. Despite the extensive efforts. in understanding SRO in HEAs/MEAs by advanced characterization techniques, there is still a lack of experimental evidence showing how rejuvenation in HEAs/MEAs is tied to the sequence of deformation mechanisms that generate the long, thin planar defects characteristic of HEAs/MEAs.

### Nemolizumab-ilto (Nemluvio) [^73e51fd7]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Step 4: Check the NEMLUVIO pen for the following:

a. Expiration date has not passed.

b. The lyophilized powder is white and not dissolved (see Figure D).

c. The pen has not been dropped and is not damaged or cracked.

 Do not use the pen, unless all conditions above are met.

If any condition is not met, call: 1-866-735-4137.

Throw away (dispose of) the pen and use a new one (see Section C: Throwing away (Disposing of) NEMLUVIO).

Step 5: Activate the NEMLUVIO pen

Hold the pen upright and unlock the pen by turning the activation knob to the right until it stops (see Figure E).

This starts the process of transferring water to the powder chamber.

Only turn the activation knob to the right once.

Step 6: Wait until the gray rod stops moving

Watch inspection window until gray rod has stopped moving (see Figure F).

 Do not shake the pen. Shaking the pen before the gray rod has completely stopped can affect the medicine dose.

Step 7: Dissolve the medicine When the gray rod has completely stopped, hold the pen upright and shake the pen up and down for 30 seconds (see Figure G).

### Familial amyloid polyneuropathy: a clinico-pathologic study [^ae5ef119]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2009). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

In familial amyloid polyneuropathy (FAP), destruction of nerve fibres is related to accumulation of mutated transthyretin (mTTR) derived amyloid deposits (AD) in the endoneurium. Liver transplantation (LT), which removes the main source of mTTR, does not prevent deterioration of the clinical condition in all recipients.

Material and Methods

We evaluated the distribution of AD in the central and peripheral nervous system in order to better understand the pathophysiology of FAP and the potential role of lesions of nerve blood vessels and of mTTR released by choroid plexuses (CP). Forty nerve biopsy specimens and 3 autopsy cases, including 7 patients who underwent liver transplantation, all from patients with symptomatic FAP and DNA mutation of the TTR gene, were included.

Results

Patients were ranged into three categories: MORPHOLOGICAL CHANGES: Amyloid predominated around endoneurial capillaries in 37 patients, with occlusion/destruction of endoneurial capillaries in 15 nerves at late stages of the disease. Post-mortem examination showed amyloid in choroid plexuses and perivascular spaces in the brain and around blood vessels penetrating the endoneurium, following arachnoid and connective tissue septae. Destruction of endoneurial blood vessels is a late event in the natural course of FAP. Morphological findings were similar in patients who underwent liver transplantation and in those who did not. The distribution of amyloid in areas communicating with the subarachnoid space suggests that mutated TTR released in the CSF may move to the endoneurial fluid and accumulate in peripheral nerves, accounting for lack of efficacy of liver transplantation in some individuals.

### Evacuation of the ICU: care of the critically ill and injured during pandemics and disasters: CHEST consensus statement [^29e65da2]. Chest (2014). Medium credibility.

Evacuation of the ICU — prioritizing critical care patient movement and receiving-facility selection: We suggest evacuation order and identification of appropriate facility should be based on the following factors. In a time-limited evacuation, less critical patients can be evacuated faster and with fewer resources per patient and, thus, may be moved first in order to evacuate the most patients in the fastest time. When there is adequate time for evacuation, then more critically ill patients may be moved first and in parallel with less ill patients. In some situations, moving groups of similar-type patients to a single hospital entity may enable the sending hospital to provide staff to a single location to facilitate continuity of care and allow receiving hospitals to preplan to surge for specific types of patients and cluster disaster resources. The most critically ill patients dependent on mechanical devices for life support may, in some conditions, be safely cared for with a shelter-in-place strategy if it is deemed the risk of evacuation is too high. Priorities for evacuating patients are situation dependent, and the receiving facility should be capable of providing care for the specific problems of patients; selection may be by one-to-one matching, but in some situations, patients may be grouped for transport to a receiving facility. Factors to consider are infrastructure damage, medical supplies and staff resources, anticipated additional patients and their needs, and provider capability, and based on this assessment the EOC leadership must work closely with transportation experts and available regional critical care units to match patient care needs to resources and services while minimizing transport distances and using all existing modes of transportation. In general, it is more common to move critically ill patients first, and consideration should be given to moving groups of patients of a specific specialty type together in certain situations. If the disaster-affected hospital is able to deliver care, it should provide medical supplies and assistance to rapidly stabilize and prepare patients for evacuation while EOC personnel are identifying transfer locations.

### After cell death: the molecular machinery of efferocytosis [^369331a7]. Experimental & Molecular Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Apoptosis is an essential process that occurs in multicellular organisms to eliminate unwanted cells, such as superfluous cells produced during development, aged cells that have lost their function, cells that can develop into cancer, damaged cells, and cells infected with viruses or bacteria, throughout life. Through apoptosis, multicellular organisms can achieve developmental integrity, maintain tissue homeostasis, and protect themselves from the spread of infection. However, inducing cell death of unwanted cells alone cannot accomplish these tasks. The dead cells must eventually be removed, as they can induce inflammation themselves. Removal of apoptotic cells, known as efferocytosis, is the final step of apoptosis. It is known that hundreds of billions of cells undergo apoptosis in a healthy human body daily. However, apoptotic cells are rarely observed, even in tissues with a high cellular turnover rate. For example, although most developing thymocytes in the thymus undergo apoptosis, apoptotic thymocytes are seldom seen in the thymus because they are swiftly and continuously removed.

Efferocytosis is generally referred to as the phagocytosis of apoptotic cells because it involves the ingestion of extracellular substances. Phagocytosis is the process of taking in extracellular particles larger than 0.5 µm in diameter by cells called phagocytes. In immunology, the term specifically refers to the ingestion and removal of bacteria and other pathogens within membrane-bound vesicles called phagosomes. The common usage of the term phagocytosis for both pathogens and apoptotic cells may be confusing to individuals outside the field, as the immune response induced after phagocytosis of pathogens differs completely from the response after the engulfment of apoptotic cells. Pathogen phagocytosis often triggers proinflammatory responses, while engulfment of apoptotic cells generally induces anti-inflammatory responses or is immunologically silent. Therefore, to avoid confusion, the term efferocytosis, which means "taking to the grave" or "burying", was proposed instead of phagocytosis of apoptotic cells and is now used in the field. Efferocytosis can be divided into four steps: recruitment of phagocytes to apoptotic cells, recognition of apoptotic cells by phagocytes, internalization of apoptotic cells into phagocytes, and degradation of apoptotic cells in phagocytes. In this review, we will discuss the molecular mechanisms underlying each of these steps in efferocytosis. In addition, calcium signaling holds considerable importance in a wide range of cellular processes, and efferocytosis is no different. In the later part of this review, our focus will be on calcium signaling during efferocytosis and elucidating its molecular-level influence on each individual step of efferocytosis, which has not been previously reviewed.

### How neutrophils meet their end [^36278894]. Trends in Immunology (2020). Medium credibility.

Neutrophil death can transpire via diverse pathways and is regulated by interactions with commensal and pathogenic microorganisms, environmental exposures, and cell age. At steady state, neutrophil turnover and replenishment are continually maintained via a delicate balance between host-mediated responses and microbial forces. Disruptions in this equilibrium directly impact neutrophil numbers in circulation, cell trafficking, antimicrobial defenses, and host well-being. How neutrophils meet their end is physiologically important and can result in different immunologic consequences. Whereas nonlytic forms of neutrophil death typically elicit anti-inflammatory responses and promote healing, pathways ending with cell membrane rupture may incite deleterious proinflammatory responses, which can exacerbate local tissue injury, lead to chronic inflammation, or precipitate autoimmunity. This review seeks to provide a contemporary analysis of mechanisms of neutrophil death.

### Don't mess with the matrix [^0a125e2a]. Nature Genetics (2001). Medium credibility.

Extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling is critical to morphogenesis and homeostasis. The identification of inactivating mutations in a gene encoding one of its modifying enzymes, matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP-2), in people with a hereditary disorder in which the bones disintegrate, represents the first genetic evidence that the proteolysis of the ECM mediates human growth and development. It also underscores the need for an intricate balance between breakdown and deposition of the ECM.

### Matrix metalloproteinases and their tissue inhibitors direct cell fate during cancer development [^117f5be0]. British Journal of Cancer (2003). Low credibility.

PERSPECTIVE

From their initial discovery in tadpole tail resorption, MMPs have catapulted into the spotlight. Initially known to be important in metastatic dissemination, MMPs have emerged as regulators of fundamental cellular processes. Their historic characterisation as ECM remodelling enzymes is perhaps simply the edge of their complex biological function and recent discoveries make it necessary to reflect and reassess current strategies for MMP inhibition in cancer. Along with the discovery of ADAMs that are also inhibited by MMP inhibitors, the discovery of new MMP substrates and mechanisms of action point to the adverse interference of normal biological processes by broad-spectrum inhibitors. Matrix metalloproteinases are no longer just mediators of metastasis during late-stage malignancy, but affect tumour initiation and growth through the loss of cell adhesion, evasion of apoptosis, and deregulation of cell division. Even more perplexing are the opposing roles of TIMPs on tumour growth and apoptosis that may depend on their relative levels, the cellular context, and the developmental programme. The challenge is to design inhibitors that are highly targeted to specific proteolytic mechanisms that stifle different stages of tumour progression, while preserving the normal tissue function. Continued research into these mechanisms will prove both challenging and exciting.

### Extracellular DNA: a bridge to cancer [^f038a497]. Cancer Research (2015). Low credibility.

DNase I is a secreted enzyme whose function has been presumed to control "waste management" in the human system, by degrading DNA that leaks from dead and dying cells. Emerging studies have instead yielded evidence that DNase I plays a central role in newly defined dynamics of immune and autoimmune diseases, as well as cancer and vascular disorders, including thrombosis. Cancer cells have been reported to be associated with distinctive extracellular structures that facilitate aggregation and implantation. The fact that DNA is a component of such structures and that it plays a role in cancer development is illustrated by direct evidence: DNase I added to tumor cells eliminates the structures and inhibits tumorigenicity of some cancer cell lines. DNase I injected into experimental animals, moreover, results in significant inhibition of metastasis. Despite independent observations of such phenomena in diverse cancers for over 50 years, the potential for using DNase I as a clinical tool to prevent or treat cancer remains unexplored. The discovery of neutrophil extracellular traps has yielded a conceptual framework for interpreting how extracellular DNA may function in cancer development and why it may prove to be an important clinical target in stopping cancer outside the cell.

### Cancer to bone: a fatal attraction [^33c2ac03]. Nature Reviews: Cancer (2011). Medium credibility.

When cancer metastasizes to bone, considerable pain and deregulated bone remodelling occurs, greatly diminishing the possibility of cure. Metastasizing tumour cells mobilize and sculpt the bone microenvironment to enhance tumour growth and to promote bone invasion. Understanding the crucial components of the bone microenvironment that influence tumour localization, along with the tumour-derived factors that modulate cellular and protein matrix components of bone to favour tumour expansion and invasion, is central to the pathophysiology of bone metastases. Basic findings of tumour-bone interactions have uncovered numerous therapeutic opportunities that focus on the bone microenvironment to prevent and treat bone metastases.

### Dishonorable discharge: the oncogenic roles of cleaved E-cadherin fragments [^614cc6c2]. Cancer Research (2012). Low credibility.

Strong cell-cell interactions represent a major barrier against cancer cell mobility, and loss of intercellular adhesion by E-cadherin is a fundamental change that occurs during the progression of cancer to invasive disease. However, some aggressive carcinomas retain characteristics of differentiated epithelial cells, including E-cadherin expression. Emerging evidence indicates that proteolysis of E-cadherin generates fragments that promote tumor growth, survival, and motility, suggesting that E-cadherin cleavage converts this tumor suppressor into an oncogenic factor. In this review we discuss the emerging roles of cleaved E-cadherin fragments as modulators of cancer progression, and explore the translational and clinical implications of this research.

### Trigeminal microvascular decompression for short-lasting unilateral neuralgiform headache attacks [^12df24fd]. Brain (2022). Medium credibility.

The surgical management of SUNHA has progressively moved away from destructive procedures targeting the trigeminal pathway, to non-destructive invasive neuromodulation modalities, namely occipital nerve stimulation (ONS) and ventral tegmental area-deep brain stimulation (VTA-DBS). However, neuromodulation treatments may take several weeks to months to exert their full benefits and may not lead to pain freedom. Furthermore hardware-related adverse events that occur in a variable proportion of cases may lead to multiple surgical reinterventions. This, along with the cost of the devices and the necessity of regular outpatient appointments, increase the overall treatment costs, restricting their use to a few highly specialized centres.

In view of the clinical similarities between SUNHA and TN as well as radiological evidence showing a high prevalence of trigeminal neurovascular conflict (NVC) in SUNHA, a few case reports and a small case series submitted SUNCT and SUNA patients to trigeminal MVD and reported positive outcomes. Here, we analyse the safety and long-term efficacy of trigeminal MVD in a large group of patients with chronic SUNHA refractory to medical management and with MRI evidence of trigeminal NVC.

### Kinetic asymmetry allows macromolecular catalysts to drive an information ratchet [^4a8aaedd]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Fig. 5
Catalysis-driven information ratchet can undergo non-equilibrium adaptation. Kinetic mechanism for transitions between the states of the molecule, where the rate constants for the catalytic reactions are shown explicitly. The direct transition between states p b and d b is blocked — both forward and backward rate constants are very small — but the equilibrium constant must nonetheless reflect the relative energies of the two states

The non-equilibrium distribution for the rotaxane in Fig. 5 persists only so long as Δ μ is maintained. If the chemical potential difference between substrate and product would relax to zero the state distribution would relax to equilibrium within several lifetimes, generally a very short time, so storing molecules in strongly non-equilibrium states would seem to be impossible. Cheng et al.solved this problem brilliantly in constructing a synthetic molecular pump that uses chemical energy to pump a molecular structure into a strongly non-equilibrium state, combined with an ingenious incorporation of a steric speedbump to kinetically maintain the structure in a non-equilibrium form for months or years after the energy supply is turned off. The approach of Cheng et al. used external manipulation of the redox potential of the system and is based not on an information ratchet but on an energy ratchet. The design, however, is amenable to being driven autonomously by catalysis, and comparisonbetween the two approaches offers important insight into the essential feature of information ratchets by which all catalytically driven mechanisms for molecular machines must work.

Box 2 Trajectory thermodynamics and microscopic reversibility

At thermodynamic equilibrium, the concentration distribution among different states of a macromolecule is determined by the free energies of the states and the chemical potentials of ligands without depending on detailed kinetics. A simple example is the elementary reactionin Fig. 5. When the chemical potentials of the ligands are chemo-stated to the same value, the concentration ratio between the two states is given by the equilibrium constant, irrespective of all other reactions in the system. As both p b and d b are bound states, this constant involves only the free energies of states p b and d b, evaluated at the reference pressure and temperature.

Away from equilibrium, where, the simple expression for the ratio between the two states does not hold. Over the last several decades the concept of an equilibrium constant has been generalized to the possibly non-equilibrium steady state (ss) using the principle of microscopic reversibility

### Cell clustering promotes a metabolic switch that supports metastatic colonization [^ffda6aba]. Cell Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The metastatic spread of tumors to distant sites is responsible for most cancer-related deaths. While this invasive process remains poorly understood, it is clear that the metastasizing cell must overcome numerous hurdles associated with movement out of the primary tumor, entry into the circulation, and re-establishment within a distant organ. These barriers make metastasis a highly inefficient process. One key limitation to successful metastasis is the caspase-dependent and caspase-independent death of cells that lose stromal interactions as they become detached from the extracellular matrix (ECM). Clearly, cells that successfully metastasize have acquired mechanisms to survive loss of attachment, and dependence on these changes may provide effective therapeutic targets. One factor that can enhance the metastatic capacity of cancers is the ability of detached cells to form clusters or aggregates, although the underlying mechanism by which aggregation supports metastatic capacity is not well understood.

Osteochondritis dissecans — evaluation of patients remaining symptomatic after treatment: In the absence of reliable evidence, it is the opinion of the work group that patients who remain symptomatic after treatment for OCD have a history and physical examination, x- rays and/or MRI to assess healing. Strength of Recommendation: Consensus, with the clarification that the supporting evidence is lacking and that a Consensus recommendation means that expert opinion supports the guideline recommendation even though there is no available empirical evidence that meets the inclusion criteria of the guideline's systematic review. In patients with OCD that remain symptomatic despite previous treatment, ongoing evaluation with a goal to preserve the patient's knee function and native cartilage is a priority, and the evaluation is based upon the patient's symptoms, signs, and imaging to detect possible deterioration; although lesion stability may not be assessed with a high level of confidence on imaging studies, the progression or worsening of the condition can be evaluated by comparing sequential imaging studies. The work group acknowledges that radiographic studies expose the patient to radiation and is aware of the increased costs of imaging studies, and notes that the practice of ongoing history, physical, and imaging studies is consistent with the current practice of most orthopaedic surgeons. Supporting evidence is stated as: There is no evidence to address this recommendation.

### Microtubule disassembly by caspases is an important rate-limiting step of cell extrusion [^5906bd65]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

How epithelia maintain their physical and chemical barrier functions despite their inherent dynamics due to cell proliferation and cell death is a central question of epithelial biology. Cell extrusion, a sequence of coordinated remodelling steps leading to cell expulsion, is an essential process to conciliate high rates of apoptosis and cell elimination while preserving tissue sealing. This process is essential for tissue homoeostasis and its perturbation can lead to chronic inflammation or contribute to tumoural cell dissemination. Yet much remains unknown about extrusion regulation and orchestration.

Studies in the last decade have demonstrated that the remodelling steps of extrusions are mainly dependent on actomyosin contraction and mechanical coupling through E-cadherin (E-cad) adhesion. First, an actomyosin ring forms in the extruding cell driving cell-autonomous constriction –. This ring pulls on neighbouring cells through E-cad anchorage, resulting in force transmission which promotes the recruitment of actomyosin in the neighbouring cells and the formation of a supracellular actomyosin cable. Eventually, the constriction of the cable combined with E-cad disassembly, leads to cell expulsion either on the apical or the basal side of the tissue. Meanwhile, neighbouring basal protrusions also contribute to cell detachment. Alternatively, pulses of contractile medio-apical actomyosin can also contribute to cell expulsion. Interestingly, while a lot of emphases has been given to actomyosin and E-cad regulation, we only have a limited understanding of the contribution of other cellular factors and cytoskeleton components to cell extrusion (see ref.for one exception). Apoptosis is one of the main mode of programmed cell death which is essential for tissue homoeostasis and morphogenesis. It is driven by the activation of caspases which through the cleavage of thousands of proteins orchestrate cell deconstruction. While caspase activation is an important mode of epithelial cell elimination, how caspases orchestrate the key steps of extrusion remain poorly understood. Accordingly, only a handful of caspase targets relevant for cell extrusion have been identified so far.

### The role of necroptosis in atherosclerotic disease [^86f14e09]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2016). Low credibility.

It has been estimated that the human body turns over billions of cells per day. Most of these cells die via a noninflammatory process known as programmed cell death, or apoptosis. Under physiological conditions, these cells are recognized and cleared via a highly efficient process known as programmed cell removal, or efferocytosis. This process occurs in what has been described as an immunologically-silent manner, with the vast majority of apoptotic cells being phagocytosed before they have a chance to undergo secondary necrosis. For these reasons, investigators have long wondered why necrotic debris accumulates during atherogenesis, and studies have investigated whether efferocytosis may be defective as plaques develop.

It is now known, however, that apoptosis is not the only way in which a cell can commit suicide. A process known as programmed cell necrosis, or "necroptosis", has recently been described. Unlike apoptosis, necroptosis appears to result in an inflammatory form of cell death, which may have evolved as a host defense against viral infection or other forms of cellular injury. This process occurs when proapoptotic caspase enzymes are exhausted or inhibited, and leads to the breakdown of plasma membranes, which causes the release of previously sequestered proinflammatory intracellular contents. Emerging studies have suggested that necroptosis may play a role in a number of inflammatory conditions and human diseases. In a study recently published by Karunakaran et al.in Science Advances, the authors asked whether this process may also be active in human atherosclerotic disease, and if it might serve as a novel translational target (Figure 1).

### Evacuation of the ICU: care of the critically ill and injured during pandemics and disasters: CHEST consensus statement [^fd8c2bd5]. Chest (2014). Medium credibility.

Prioritizing critical care patients for evacuation — ordering by time and acuity, grouping, and shelter-in-place: We suggest evacuation order and identification of appropriate facility should be based on specified factors, including that in a time-limited evacuation, less critical patients can be evacuated faster and with fewer resources per patient and may be moved first to evacuate the most patients in the fastest time; when there is adequate time for evacuation, more critically ill patients may be moved first and in parallel with less ill patients, and moving both the less critical and more critical patients simultaneously in parallel, as compared with sequentially in series, may decrease the overall time to evacuation; in some situations, moving groups of similar-type patients to a single hospital entity may enable the sending hospital to provide staff to a single location to facilitate continuity of care and allow receiving hospitals to preplan to surge for specific types of patients and cluster disaster resources; and the most critically ill patients dependent on mechanical devices for life support may, in some conditions, be safely cared for with a shelter-in-place strategy if the risk of evacuation is deemed too high.

### Correlation as a determinant of configurational entropy in… [^d7adb1fc]. stacks.cdc.gov (2014). Low credibility.

Correlation as a determinant of configurational entropy in supramolecular and protein systems 2014/06/19 By Fedorowicz A; Fenley AT; Gilson MK;. File Language: Details Personal Author: Description: For biomolecules in solution, changes in configurational entropy are thought to contribute substantially to the free energies of processes like binding and conformational change. In principle, the configurational entropy can be strongly affected by pairwise and higher-order correlations among conformational degrees of freedom. However, the literature offers mixed perspectives regarding the contributions that changes in correlations make to changes in configurational entropy for such processes. Here we take advantage of powerful techniques for simulation and entropy analysis to carry out rigorous in silico studies of correlation in binding and conformational changes.

In particular, we apply information-theoretic expansions of the configurational entropy to well-sampled molecular dynamics simulations of a model host-guest system and the protein bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor. The results bear on the interpretation of NMR data, as they indicate that changes in correlation are important determinants of entropy changes for biologically relevant processes and that changes in correlation may either balance or reinforce changes in first-order entropy. The results also highlight the importance of main-chain torsions as contributors to changes in protein configurational entropy. As simulation techniques grow in power, the mathematical techniques used here will offer new opportunities to answer challenging questions about complex molecular systems.

In contrast, OCT angiography (OCTA) without a contrast agent uses light with a wavelength of 840–1050 nm, to amplify and calculate the differences in the signals emitted from moving and non-moving tissues, and detect the flow of erythrocytes within the blood vessels, thereby producing reconstructed images of the retinal and choroidal vascular structure. The data obtained from the retinal volume scan are reconstructed as en face images, and they also provide information about the capillary morphology and FAZ area. Therefore, in the present study, we used SS-OCTA to analyze changes in the macular capillary structure following treatment for BRVO-induced ME and investigated the factors associated with ME recurrence.

### 25th RCOphth congress, president's session paper: 25 years of progress in medical retina [^6a5f7605]. Eye (2014). Low credibility.

The quarter century since the foundation of the Royal College of Ophthalmologists has coincided with immense change in the subspecialty of medical retina, which has moved from being the province of a few dedicated enthusiasts to being an integral, core part of ophthalmology in every eye department. In age-related macular degeneration, there has been a move away from targeted, destructive laser therapy, dependent on fluorescein angiography to intravitreal injection therapy of anti-growth factor agents, largely guided by optical coherence tomography. As a result of these changes, ophthalmologists have witnessed a marked improvement in visual outcomes for their patients with wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD), while at the same time developing and enacting entirely novel ways of delivering care. In the field of diabetic retinopathy, this period also saw advances in laser technology and a move away from highly destructive laser photocoagulation treatment to gentler retinal laser treatments. The introduction of intravitreal therapies, both steroids and anti-growth factor agents, has further advanced the treatment of diabetic macular oedema. This era has also seen in the United Kingdom the introduction of a coordinated national diabetic retinopathy screening programme, which offers an increasing hope that the burden of blindness from diabetic eye disease can be lessened. Exciting future advances in retinal imaging, genetics, and pharmacology will allow us to further improve outcomes for our patients and for ophthalmologists specialising in medical retina, the future looks very exciting but increasingly busy.

### Diagnosis and treatment of osteochondritis dissecans [^b3339daa]. AAOS (2023). High credibility.

Osteochondritis dissecans (OCD) recommendation — symptomatic skeletally immature patients with unstable or displaced lesions be offered the option of surgery, with Strength of Recommendation: Limited. The rationale explains that skeletally immature children with progressing symptoms and signs of loosening (usually detected by magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) are unlikely to heal without treatment, and that skeletally immature and mature patients may be at higher risk of developing severe osteoarthritis at an early age. The work group acknowledges a paucity of evidence regarding fixation of unstable OCD lesions and details surgical risks (bleeding, infection, damage to nerves and blood vessels, venous thromboembolic events, anesthesia complications, surgical failure), while noting that not performing surgery also carries a risk of irreversible osteoarthritis/osteoarthrosis. The panel states that symptomatic patients with salvageable unstable or displaced OCD lesions be given the option of balancing the risks and benefits, with potential benefits including prevention or delay of severe osteoarthritis and relief of existing symptoms, and stresses shared decision making between the patient, family, and physician.

### Spatial adiabatic passage of massive quantum particles in an optical lieb lattice [^e7c68ddc]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Quantum interference lies at the heart of quantum mechanics. By utilizing destructive interference, it is possible to transfer a physical object between two states without populating an intermediate state which is necessary to connect the initial and final states. A famous application is a technique of stimulated Raman adiabatic passage, where atomic internal states can be transfered with high efficiency regardless of lossy intermediate states. One interesting situation is a case where the initial and final states are spatially well separated. Quantum mechanics allows a particle to move without practical possibility of being found at the intermediate area. Here we demonstrate this spatial adiabatic passage with ultracold atoms in an optical lattice. Key to this is the existence of dark eigenstates forming a flat energy band, with effective transfer between two sublattices being observed. This work sheds light on a study of coherent control of trapped cold atoms.

### Remission in rheumatoid arthritis: working toward incorporation of the patient perspective at OMERACT 12 [^5de9eb2d]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

The treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) should target patient-relevant outcomes, making patient perspective on remission essential. In 2010, patients, physicians, health professionals, and researchers at the Outcome Measures in Rheumatology (OMERACT) conference developed an ambitious research agenda to study the concept of remission. Qualitative research has since helped us understand the concept of remission from the patient perspective.

Methods

During OMERACT 12, the OMERACT working group on patient perspective on remission in RA elaborated on data generated to date and discussed the methodological challenges ahead. Challenges included (1) selection of domains, (2) choice of a patient remission definition or a single domain to add to the current remission definition, and (3) the importance of pain in defining remission from a patient perspective.

Results

Focus in the coming years will be on increasing our understanding by identifying the most important domains from the patient perspective regarding remission and investigating how these domains can be measured. Investigation into the Rheumatoid Arthritis Impact of Disease questionnaire, disease flare, as well as the concordance of domains from our ongoing remission survey is appropriate. More data and further discussions are needed to decide on the next steps.

Conclusion

Progress summarized over 4 years highlights the main methodological challenges discussed within the working group on patient perspective on remission in RA during OMERACT 12.

Diagnosis and treatment of osteochondritis dissecans — opinion-based recommendation process and voting checklist emphasize considering current practice, transparent cost rationale, and defined voting steps. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) notes clinicians "justifiably fear that not doing something that is done on a widespread basis will lead to litigation", and "The consequences of not providing a service that is neither widely available nor widely used are less serious than the consequences of not providing a treatment accepted by the medical profession and thus expected by patients". The page highlights that discussions rely on mutual communication and that the patient's "expectation of treatment" must be tempered by physician guidance, and directs to "Justify, why a more costly device, drug, or procedure is being recommended over a less costly one whenever such an opinion-based recommendation is made". Process-wise, "Work group members write the rationales for opinion based recommendations on the first day of the final work group meeting" and vote on the second day; "If the work group cannot adopt a rationale after three votes, the rationale and the opinion-based recommendation will be withdrawn", with a statement that the group "can neither recommend for or against" included in the guideline. Members may reconsider during discussion, and "any member of the work group can make a motion to withdraw that recommendation". The "CHECKLIST FOR VOTING ON OPINION-BASED RECOMMENDATIONS" asks, "Does the recommendation affect a substantial number of patients or address treatment (or diagnosis) of a condition that causes death and/or considerable suffering?" and whether serious harms are addressed and "why the potential benefits outweigh the potential harms".

### Universality in volume-law entanglement of scrambled pure quantum States [^50fa17ac]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Introduction

As a measure of the quantum correlations in many-body systems, the entanglement entropy (EE) has become an indispensable tool in modern physics. The EE quantifies the amount of non-local correlation between a subsystem and its compliment. The ability of the EE to expose the non-local features of a system offers a way to characterize topological orders, solve the black hole information paradox, and quantify information scrambling in a thermalization process under unitary time evolution –.

Recently, the EE was measured in quantum many-body systems for the first time. Specifically, the second Rényi EE (2REE), one of the variants of the EE, of a pure quantum state was measured in quantum quench experiments using ultra-cold atoms. For such pure quantum states, it is believed that the EE of any small subsystem increases in proportion to the size of the subsystem just like the thermodynamic entropy. This is called the volume law of the EE. However, when the size of a subsystem becomes comparable to that of its complement, it is observed experimentally that the EE starts deviating from the volume law, and eventually decreases (Fig. 1). The curved structure of the size dependence of the EE, which first increases linearly and then decreases, universally appears in various excited pure states, for example, energy eigenstatesand states after quantum quenches. We call this curved structure a Page curve, after D. Page, and it is of fundamental importance in explaining these examples to reveal a universal behavior of the Page curve.

### Diagnosis and treatment of osteochondritis dissecans [^b3bb7ff8]. AAOS (2023). High credibility.

Osteochondritis dissecans (OCD) — symptomatic skeletally mature patients with unstable or displaced lesions be offered the option of surgery (Strength of Recommendation: Limited). Skeletally mature patients with OCD lesions who have a history of not healing and/or signs of loosening are unlikely to heal without treatment and may be at a higher risk of developing severe osteoarthritis at an early age. The guideline notes that surgery entails risks including bleeding, infection, damage to nerves and blood vessels, venous thromboembolic events, anesthesia complications, and surgical failure, while not performing surgery also carries a risk of irreversible osteoarthritis/osteoarthrosis. For symptomatic patients with "salvageable, unstable or displaced OCD lesions", either unstable but in situ or displaced, restoration using the patient's native tissue may be possible, and patients should be given the option of balancing risks and benefits of performing or not performing surgery. The choice to proceed with surgery is part of a shared decision making process, and offering the option is not a mandate; patients can decline surgery.

### Screw placement and osteoplasty under computed tomographic-fluoroscopic guidance in a case of advanced metastatic destruction of the iliosacral joint [^3319c851]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2011). Low credibility.

We present a case of combined surgical screw placement and osteoplasty guided by computed tomography-fluoroscopy (CTF) in a 68-year-old man with unilateral osteolytic destruction and a pathological fracture of the iliosacral joint due to a metastasis from renal cell carcinoma. The patient experienced intractable lower back pain that was refractory to analgesia. After transarterial particle and coil embolization of the tumor-feeding vessels in the angiography unit, the procedure was performed under general anesthesia by an interdisciplinary team of interventional radiologists and trauma surgeons. Under intermittent single-shot CTF, two K wires were inserted into the left iliosacral joint from a lateral transiliac approach at the S1 level followed by two self-tapping surgical screws. Continuous CTF was used for monitoring of the subsequent polymethylmethacrylate injection through two vertebroplasty cannulas for further stabilization of the screw threads within the osteolytic sacral ala. Both the screw placement and cement injection were successful, with no complications occurring during or after the procedure. With additional nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory and opioid medication, the patient reported a marked decrease in his lower back pain and was able to move independently again at the 3-month follow-up assessment. In our patient with intolerable back pain due to tumor destruction and consequent pathological fracture of the iliosacral joint, CTF-guided iliosacral screw placement combined with osteoplasty was successful with respect to joint stabilization and a reduction in the need for analgesic therapy.

### Stepwise control of host-guest interaction using a coordination polymer gel [^3c5b9997]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Ever since the postulation of the lock and key concept by Emil Fischer in 1894, a myriad of studies have been reported in the area of host–guest interactions, aiming at understanding the mechanism behind enzymatic action in biological systems. Most of the enzymatic processes such as synthesis of peptides, degradation of various metabolites, synthesis and hydrolysis of adenosine triphosphate, etc. proceed in a stepwise fashion and with absolute control. Several of these natural systems are precisely controlled by external or internal stimuli; however, designing such artificial stimuli-responsive systems remains a challenging task. Owing to its instant delivery at a specific location and control via different wavelengths and intensities, light is arguably the most attractive physical stimulus for artificial systems –. However, although heat is not considered as a stimulus with precisional control, natural host–guest processes are mainly controlled by heat. Since equilibrium constants of host–guest interactions are constant at a particular temperature, change of temperature of a system at chemical equilibrium may change the equilibrium constant, followed by the shifting of the equilibrium towards a direction to undo the change according to Le Châtelier's principle. Temperature can therefore take advantage of the thermodynamic benefits of host–guest equilibrium, and be exploited to demonstrate the formation (capture) or dissociation (release) of a host–guest complex in a stepwise manner. An ideal host system with multiple guests that facilitates temperature-controlled stepwise release–capture process is shown in Fig. 1 –. This strategy may further help us in developing thermoresponsive smart materials, for example, a drug delivery system similar to the concept of magic bullet propounded by Ehrlich, which can be programmed for drug delivery as well as drug re-uptake or clearance from the blood stream essential for tackling issues like drug resistance and side-effects.

Guideline definitions for key action statements (Table 4) — a strong recommendation is defined as "A particular action is favored because anticipated benefits clearly exceed harms (or vice versa) and quality of evidence is excellent or unobtainable", with the implication "Clinicians should follow a strong recommendation unless a clear and compelling rationale for an alternative approach is present". A moderate recommendation is defined as "A particular action is favored because anticipated benefits clearly exceed harms (or vice versa) and the quality of evidence is good but not excellent (or is unobtainable)", implying "Clinicians would be prudent to follow a moderate recommendation but should remain alert to new information and sensitive to patient preferences". A weak recommendation (based on low-quality evidence) is defined as "A particular action is favored because anticipated benefits clearly exceed harms (or vice versa), but the quality of evidence is weak", with the implication "Clinicians would be prudent to follow a weak recommendation but should remain alert to new information and very sensitive to patient preferences". A weak recommendation (based on balance of benefits and harms) is defined as "Weak recommendation is provided when the aggregate database shows evidence of both benefit and harm that appear to be similar in magnitude for any available courses of action", implying "Clinicians should consider the options in their decision-making, but patient preference may have a substantial role".
