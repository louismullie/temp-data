## Question

Treatment For elbow bursitis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about treatment for elbow (olecranon) bursitis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about distinguishing septic from aseptic bursitis because that drives everything. Then, I should verify the diagnostic approach, including when to aspirate and what tests to order. Next, I will review evidence-based treatment for aseptic cases, followed by management of septic cases. After that, I need to consider special populations and complications. Finally, I will synthesize a practical algorithm and highlight key takeaways with appropriate citations.

> Let me first confirm the critical distinction: septic versus aseptic olecranon bursitis, because treatment diverges substantially. Septic bursitis is more likely with erythema, warmth, marked tenderness, fever, and systemic symptoms, whereas aseptic bursitis is typically painless or mildly tender and associated with repetitive microtrauma or inflammatory arthritis; however, overlap is common, so I should not rely on exam alone to exclude infection [^113XnmfY] [^112EJvpa].

> Wait, let me verify the diagnostic approach before committing to treatment. If infection is suspected, aspiration with synovial fluid analysis is indicated to obtain Gram stain, cell count, glucose, crystals, and culture; holding cultures for an adequate duration is essential, especially for slow-growing organisms like Propionibacterium acnes, which may require 9–14 days and anaerobic media to detect [^112EJvpa] [^112UhT6x]. I should also confirm that ultrasound can help distinguish bursal effusion from cellulitis and guide aspiration, which is a useful adjunct in the right hands [^112EJvpa].

> For aseptic olecranon bursitis, I need to ensure I anchor on conservative care first. The cornerstone is activity modification to avoid direct pressure on the olecranon, soft padding, and compression with a sleeve or ace wrap, often combined with NSAIDs for pain and inflammation; most cases resolve with these measures over weeks to months, and I should counsel patients accordingly [^116mKaCA] [^1116PzVn] [^112EJvpa]. Hold on, I should verify the role of aspiration here; routine aspiration of aseptic bursitis increases iatrogenic infection risk and is generally not recommended unless for diagnostic uncertainty or symptomatic relief in select cases, so I should avoid reflexive drainage [^112EJvpa].

> Next, I should review the evidence for corticosteroid injection in aseptic cases. A randomized trial suggests aspiration plus steroid can hasten symptom resolution by about one week compared with aspiration alone or compression plus NSAIDs, but there was no significant difference in overall resolution rates by 4 weeks; importantly, injections carry risks such as chronic drainage, infection, and skin atrophy, so I need to weigh marginal benefit against potential harm and patient preferences [^116LWq3d]. Let me reconsider guideline positions: ACOEM advises against routine steroid injection for aseptic olecranon bursitis, whereas multisociety pain guidelines allow that aspiration with steroid may be offered with low certainty of benefit; reconciling this, I should reserve injections for refractory cases after a trial of conservative care and discuss risks explicitly [^1116PzVn] [^114ZfAdJ].

> For septic olecranon bursitis, I should confirm that antibiotics are mandatory. Empiric therapy should target Staphylococcus aureus, the most common pathogen, with adjustment based on culture results; typical courses range from 1–2 weeks, extending if osteomyelitis is present or if response is slow [^112EJvpa] [^113XnmfY]. But wait, what about aspiration itself? Traditional teaching favors aspiration for diagnosis and to reduce bursal pressure, yet emerging retrospective data suggest that carefully selected, immunocompetent patients with uncomplicated presentations may do well with empiric antibiotics alone without aspiration, with lower rates of chronic drainage and bursectomy; however, this remains lower-level evidence, so I should individualize and ensure close follow-up if I consider this path [^112qd9GH] [^1154jqqf] [^111B9w6a].

> I will now examine indications for surgical intervention. Surgery is reserved for refractory cases: failure of antibiotics in septic bursitis, recurrent or chronic bursitis with persistent drainage despite conservative care, or concern for osteomyelitis. Bursectomy can be curative but carries risks such as delayed healing, infection, and the need for flap coverage in some patients, with revision surgery in roughly 11–12% in series, particularly in those with diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, or prior ipsilateral/contralateral bursitis [^1116PzVn] [^114yTadv]. Hold on, I should verify that newer minimally invasive options like hydrothermal ablation are being explored for recurrent aseptic cases; early prospective data show promising short-term outcomes, but this remains investigational and should not replace standard care yet [^116gLLd4].

> Let me consider special populations and complications so I do not miss nuances. Immunocompromised patients have higher risks of infection and atypical pathogens, so I should maintain a lower threshold to aspirate, broaden culture techniques, and extend antibiotic durations as needed. Rare organisms like Prototheca have been reported in immunocompromised hosts, underscoring the need to reassess if there is treatment failure [^113QJJBD]. I should double-check for osteomyelitis when symptoms persist or when MRI suggests bone involvement, as this changes antibiotic selection and duration, and may necessitate surgical debridement [^1121WXML].

> Next, I should review a practical, stepwise algorithm and make sure it aligns with evidence. First, confirm diagnosis and screen for infection with history, exam, and selective labs. Second, if infection is suspected, aspirate and start empiric antibiotics covering S. aureus, then tailor to cultures. Third, if aseptic, initiate conservative management with pressure avoidance, padding, compression, and NSAIDs, reassessing at 2–4 weeks. Fourth, if persistent symptoms after 4–6 weeks, consider a single aspiration with or without steroid after discussing risks, or refer for surgical evaluation. Fifth, if septic and failing antibiotics, or if chronic/recurrent bursitis with drainage, proceed to bursectomy with awareness of wound complications and possible flap needs [^1116PzVn] [^112EJvpa] [^116LWq3d] [^114yTadv].

> Key takeaway, and I should confirm this is consistent with the highest-quality guidance: for aseptic olecranon bursitis, conservative management with activity modification, padding, compression, and NSAIDs is first-line and effective for most patients. Steroid injection offers only modest and earlier symptom relief at the expense of iatrogenic risks, so it should be reserved for select refractory cases. For septic bursitis, timely antibiotics are essential, aspiration remains standard for diagnosis and decompression in many settings, and surgery is reserved for failures or complications, with emerging evidence that carefully selected patients may do well with empiric antibiotics alone under close supervision [^116mKaCA] [^1116PzVn] [^116LWq3d] [^112qd9GH].

Elbow bursitis (olecranon bursitis) is managed based on whether it is **septic or aseptic**. For **aseptic bursitis**, use **conservative care** (rest, ice, NSAIDs, padding, activity modification) [^116mKaCA]; consider aspiration or corticosteroid injection only if symptoms persist or swelling is large [^116LWq3d] [^114ZfAdJ]. For **septic bursitis**, **aspirate for diagnosis** [^112EJvpa], start empiric antibiotics targeting Staphylococcus aureus [^112EJvpa], and escalate to IV therapy or surgical drainage if there is no improvement or if osteomyelitis is suspected [^112EJvpa]. Most cases resolve with conservative care, but recurrence is common without pressure avoidance [^116mKaCA].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

Accurate diagnosis is essential to guide therapy; distinguish **septic from aseptic bursitis** using clinical features and, when indicated, aspiration [^112EJvpa].

- **Clinical features**: Septic bursitis typically presents with erythema, warmth, tenderness, and systemic symptoms (fever, malaise) [^113XnmfY]. Aseptic bursitis is usually painless or mildly tender, with minimal erythema or warmth [^notfound].

- **Aspiration**: Indicated when infection is suspected or to differentiate septic from aseptic bursitis. Analyze fluid for Gram stain, culture, cell count, glucose, and crystals [^112EJvpa].

- **Imaging**: Ultrasound can help distinguish bursitis from cellulitis and guide aspiration [^112EJvpa]. MRI is reserved for suspected osteomyelitis or deep infection [^notfound].

---

## Conservative management (aseptic bursitis)

Most cases of aseptic olecranon bursitis resolve with **conservative measures**:

- **Rest and activity modification**: Avoid prolonged pressure on the elbow (e.g. elbow pads, activity changes) [^1116PzVn].

- **Ice and elevation**: Reduce swelling and inflammation [^112EJvpa].

- **NSAIDs**: Ibuprofen or naproxen for pain and inflammation [^116mKaCA].

- **Compression**: Gentle compression sleeves or bandages to reduce swelling [^1116PzVn].

- **Observation**: Many cases resolve spontaneously over weeks to months [^116mKaCA].

---

## Aspiration and corticosteroid injection

Aspiration alone or with corticosteroid injection is considered for persistent **aseptic bursitis** or large effusions causing discomfort or functional impairment [^116LWq3d]. Aspiration alone can relieve pressure and discomfort, but recurrence is common [^112EJvpa]. Aspiration with corticosteroid may hasten symptom resolution, but carries risks of infection, skin atrophy, and chronic drainage; use selectively after discussing risks and benefits [^116LWq3d] [^114ZfAdJ].

---

## Management of septic bursitis

Septic bursitis requires **prompt intervention** to prevent complications:

- **Aspiration**: Perform diagnostic aspiration to confirm infection and guide antibiotic therapy [^112EJvpa].

- **Antibiotics**: Initiate empiric oral antibiotics targeting Staphylococcus aureus (e.g. cephalexin, dicloxacillin, clindamycin) [^112EJvpa]. Adjust based on culture results and clinical response [^112EJvpa].

- **Intravenous antibiotics**: Indicated for severe infection, immunocompromised patients, or failure of oral therapy [^112EJvpa].

- **Surgical drainage**: Reserved for refractory cases, chronic infection, or suspected osteomyelitis [^1116PzVn].

---

## Surgical interventions

Surgery is rarely indicated and reserved for **refractory or complicated cases**:

- **Bursectomy**: Indicated for chronic, recurrent bursitis unresponsive to conservative care, or persistent infection [^1116PzVn].

- **Complications**: Delayed wound healing, infection, and recurrence are potential risks [^114yTadv].

---

## Prognosis and recurrence

Aseptic bursitis generally has a good prognosis, with most cases resolving with conservative care, though recurrence is common without ongoing pressure avoidance [^116mKaCA]. Septic bursitis also has a favorable prognosis with appropriate treatment, but complications such as chronic infection or osteomyelitis can occur if inadequately managed [^112EJvpa].

---

## Summary of treatment algorithm

| **Condition** | **Initial management** | **Escalation if refractory** |
|-|-|-|
| Aseptic bursitis | - Rest <br/> - Ice <br/> - NSAIDs <br/> - Compression <br/> - Activity modification | - Aspiration <br/> - Corticosteroid injection |
| Septic bursitis | - Aspiration <br/> - Oral antibiotics | - IV antibiotics <br/> - Surgical drainage |

---

Elbow bursitis treatment is **tailored to etiology**: prioritize conservative care for aseptic cases and prompt antibiotics with aspiration for septic cases, reserving surgery for refractory or complicated disease.

### Diagnostic and therapeutic injection of the elbow region [^112RqGQX]. American Family Physician (2002). Low credibility.

Joint injection of the elbow is a useful diagnostic and therapeutic tool for the family physician. In this article, the injection procedures for the elbow joint, medial and lateral epicondylitis, and olecranon bursitis are reviewed. Persistent pain related to inflammatory conditions responds well to injection in the region. Indications for elbow joint injection include osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. Corticosteroid injection is an accepted treatment option for medial and lateral epicondylitis. Olecranon bursa aspiration and injection are useful when that bursa is inflamed. The proper techniques, choice and quantity of pharmaceuticals, and appropriate follow-up essential for effective outcomes are discussed.

### A randomized trial among compression plus nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, aspiration, and aspiration with steroid injection for nonseptic olecranon bursitis [^116LWq3d]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Olecranon bursitis might be a minor problem in the outpatient clinic but relatively be common to occur. However, there are few well-designed studies comparing approaches to treatment.

Questions/Purposes

(1) Which treatment (compression bandaging with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs [NSAIDs], aspiration, or aspiration with steroid injections) is associated with the highest likelihood of resolution of nonseptic olecranon bursitis? (2) Which treatment is associated with earliest resolution of symptoms? (3) What factors are associated with treatment failure by 4 weeks?

Methods

We enrolled 133 patients from two centers; after applying prespecified exclusions (septic bursitis or concomitant inflammatory arthritis, intraarticular elbow pathology, recent aspiration or steroid injection done elsewhere, and refusal to participate), 90 patients were randomly allocated to receive compression bandaging with NSAIDs (C), aspiration (A), or aspiration with steroid injection (AS) groups (30 patients in each). The groups were similar at baseline in terms of age and gender. Seven patients (four from Group A and three from Group AS) were lost to followup. All patients were followed up weekly for 4 weeks, and the same treatment procedure was repeated if the bursitis recurred with any substantial fluid collection. At 4 weeks, the state of resolution and pain visual analog scale (VAS) were evaluated. Failed resolution was defined as presence of persistent olecranon bursal fluid collection at Week 4 after the initiation of the treatment; on the contrary, if bursal fluid collection was clinically reduced or completely disappeared by the end of Week 4, the treatment was considered successful. We compared the proportion of resolution by Week 4 and the median times to resolution among the treatment groups. In addition, we evaluated whether the resolution affected pain VAS and what factors were associated with the resolution.

Results

There were no differences in the proportion of patients whose bursitis resolved by Week 4 among the three treatment groups (Group C: 25 of 30 [83%], relative risk of resolution failure: 0.68 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 0.27–1.72], p = 0.580; Group A: 17 of 26 [65%], relative risk of resolution failure: 2.19 [95% CI, 0.98–4.87], p = 0.083; Group AS: 23 of 27 [85%], relative risk of resolution failure: 0.59 [95% CI, 0.22–1.63], p = 0.398) (p = 0.073). Steroid injection after aspiration (Group AS) was associated with the earliest resolution (2.3 weeks [range, 1–4 weeks]) when compared with aspiration alone (Group A; 3.1 weeks [range, 2–4 weeks]) and compression bandaging with NSAIDs (Group C; 3.2 weeks [range, 2–4 weeks]), p = 0.015). Longer duration of symptoms before treatment was the only factor associated with treatment failure by 4 weeks (failed resolution: 6 weeks [range, 2–9 weeks]; successful resolution: 4 weeks [range, 0.4–6 weeks]; p = 0.008).

Conclusions

With the numbers available, there were no differences in efficacy when compression bandaging with NSAIDs, aspiration, and aspiration with steroid injection were compared. However, we were powered only to detect a 30% difference, meaning that if there were a smaller difference in efficacy among the groups, we might not have detected it in a study of this size. Our data can be used as pilot data to power future prospective (and likely multicenter) trials. Because olecranon bursitis can recur, and because treatments like aspiration and aspiration with steroid injection can cause complications, unless future trials demonstrate clear efficacy advantages of aspiration and/or injection both at short and longer terms, we suggest that compression bandaging and a short course of NSAIDs may offer the most appropriate balance of safety and efficacy.

### ACOEM practice guidelines: elbow disorders [^117LGch2]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

The American College of Occupational and Environmental Medicine has updated the treatment guidelines in its Elbow Disorders chapter through revision processes begun in 2006. This abbreviated version of that chapter highlights some of the evidence and recommendations developed.

Methods

Comprehensive systematic literature reviews were accomplished with article abstraction, critiquing, grading, evidence table compilation, and guideline finalization by a multidisciplinary expert panel and extensive peer-review to develop evidence-based guidance. Consensus recommendations were formulated when evidence was lacking and often relied on analogy to other disorders for which evidence exists. A total of 108 high- or moderate-quality trials were identified for elbow disorders.

Results

Guidance has been developed for 13 major diagnoses and includes 270 specific recommendations.

Conclusion

Quality evidence is now available to guide treatment for elbow disorders, particularly for lateral epicondylalgia.

### Evaluation of elbow pain in adults [^115Pp1rg]. American Family Physician (2014). Low credibility.

The elbow is a complex joint designed to withstand a wide range of dynamic exertional forces. The location and quality of elbow pain can generally localize the injury to one of the four anatomic regions: anterior, medial, lateral, or posterior. The history should include questions about the onset of pain, what the patient was doing when the pain started, and the type and frequency of athletic and occupational activities. Lateral and medial epicondylitis are two of the more common diagnoses and often occur as a result of occupational activities. Patients have pain and tenderness over the affected tendinous insertion that are accentuated with specific movements. If lateral and medial epicondylitis treatments are unsuccessful, ulnar neuropathy and radial tunnel syndrome should be considered. Ulnar collateral ligament injuries occur in athletes participating in sports that involve overhead throwing. Biceps tendinopathy is a relatively common source of pain in the anterior elbow; history often includes repeated elbow flexion with forearm supination and pronation. Olecranon bursitis is a common cause of posterior elbow pain and swelling. It can be septic or aseptic, and is diagnosed based on history, physical examination, and bursal fluid analysis if necessary. Plain radiography is the initial choice for the evaluation of acute injuries and is best for showing bony injuries, soft tissue swelling, and joint effusions. Magnetic resonance imaging is the preferred imaging modality for chronic elbow pain. Musculoskeletal ultrasonography allows for an inexpensive dynamic evaluation of commonly injured structures.

### Olecranon bursitis [^113XnmfY]. Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Bursitis is a common medical condition, and of all the bursae in the body, the olecranon bursa is one of the most frequently affected. Bursitis at this location can be acute or chronic in timing and septic or aseptic. Distinguishing between septic and aseptic bursitis can be difficult, and the current literature is not clear on the optimum length or route of antibiotic treatment for septic cases. The current literature was reviewed to clarify these points.

Methods

The reported data for olecranon bursitis were compiled from the current literature.

Results

The most common physical examination findings were tenderness (88% septic, 36% aseptic), erythema/cellulitis (83% septic, 27% aseptic), warmth (84% septic, 56% aseptic), report of trauma or evidence of a skin lesion (50% septic, 25% aseptic), and fever (38% septic, 0% aseptic). General laboratory data ranges were also summarized.

Conclusions

Distinguishing between septic and aseptic olecranon bursitis can be difficult because the physical and laboratory data overlap. Evidence for the optimum length and route of antibiotic treatment for septic cases also differs. In this review we have presented the current data of offending bacteria, frequency of key physical examination findings, ranges of reported laboratory data, and treatment practices so that clinicians might have a better guide for treatment.

### Clinical management of olecranon bursitis: a review [^116mKaCA]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Olecranon bursitis is a disease characterized by inflammation of the olecranon bursa, most often due to microtrauma. Although it is a common condition, there is a lack of evidence-based recommendations for the management of nonseptic olecranon bursitis. The condition is often self-limited and resolves with conservative methods such as rest, ice, compression, orthosis wear, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications. Older studies have shown resolution of symptoms with intrabursal corticosteroid injections and surgical bursectomy. More recent literature has demonstrated adverse effects of intrabursal injections and surgery compared with noninvasive management for initial treatment of nonseptic olecranon bursitis. In order to better tailor decision-making, it is important that hand surgeons understand the comparative efficacies of each option for management of nonseptic olecranon bursitis.

### Is it time to reconsider the indications for surgery in patients with tennis elbow? [^116V4mPH]. The Bone & Joint Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Tennis elbow (lateral epicondylitis or lateral elbow tendinopathy) is a self-limiting condition in most patients. Surgery is often offered to patients who fail to improve with conservative treatment. However, there is no evidence to support the superiority of surgery over continued nonoperative care or no treatment. New evidence also suggests that the prognosis of tennis elbow is not influenced by the duration of symptoms, and that there is a 50% probability of recovery every three to four months. This finding challenges the belief that failed nonoperative care is an indication for surgery. In this annotation, we discuss the clinical and research implications of the benign clinical course of tennis elbow. Cite this article: Bone Joint J 2023;105-B(2):109–111.

### Septic bursitis: a case report and primer for the emergency clinician [^114WErpg]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

We describe the case of a 44-year-old man who presented to the Emergency Department (ED) complaining of pain and swelling over the left elbow of 1-week duration. After olecranon bursal aspiration, synovial fluid analysis yielded an increased white blood cell count (3040 cells/mm(3)) and the presence of bacteria. Culture of the fluid later grew Staphylococcus aureus. The patient was initially treated with oral antibiotics for septic bursitis and returned to the orthopedics clinic for follow-up 2 days later with interval worsening of symptoms. He was subsequently admitted for parenteral antibiotics and surgical wash-out of the affected bursa. This report briefly discusses the clinical history and appropriate diagnostic evaluation for septic olecranon bursitis, as well as the shortcomings of existing treatment guidelines.

### Elbow arthritis: current concepts [^111WJeH9]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

The purpose of this article is to provide an update and analyze current management, treatment options, and outcomes of elbow arthritis. This article focuses on studies that have been published in the past 5 years. Nonoperative management may provide symptomatic relief in the early stages of the disease process for most patients. Surgical treatment is guided by disease etiology and severity, patient age, and functional demands. Arthroscopic or open synovectomy, debridement arthroplasty, and interposition arthroplasty are generally recommended for the young and active patient population, whereas for low-demand and elderly patients with end-stage painful arthritis, total elbow arthroplasty is considered a more suitable surgical option. Advances in arthroscopic techniques and implant design have led to substantial improvements in treatment of elbow arthritis.

### Elbow arthritis [^11445oaX]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Elbow arthritis is an uncommon condition that can cause debilitating pain, stiffness, or instability. The most common etiologies include rheumatoid arthritis, posttraumatic arthritis, and primary osteoarthritis. Treatment begins with nonsurgical modalities, including activity modification, anti-inflammatories, hand therapy, and corticosteroids. Operative intervention may be considered once nonsurgical management has failed. Surgical treatment depends on the underlying etiology, chief complaint, patient age, and functional demand. Advances in technology, especially arthroscopic techniques, have expanded the treatment options available to surgeons. The goals of treatment include pain relief and restoration of functional range of motion. The purpose of this article is to review the pertinent soft tissue and osseous anatomy, discuss the etiologies, review the principles of diagnosis and evaluation, and finally, study the treatment options for elbow arthritis.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® acute elbow and forearm pain [^117KmBAm]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Acute elbow pain can be the result of traumatic and atraumatic processes. Pathologic processes include osseous, ligamentous, and tendinous etiologies. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process support the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer reviewed journals. Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where peer reviewed literature is lacking or equivocal, experts may be the primary evidentiary source available to formulate a recommendation.

### Management of lateral epicondylitis: current concepts [^1148Vsxa]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2008). Low credibility.

Lateral epicondylitis, or tennis elbow, is a common cause of elbow pain in the general population. Traditionally, lateral epicondylitis has been attributed to degeneration of the extensor carpi radialis brevis origin, although the underlying collateral ligamentous complex and joint capsule also have been implicated. Nonsurgical treatment, the mainstay of management, involves a myriad of options, including rest, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, physical therapy, cortisone, blood and botulinum toxin injections, supportive forearm bracing, and local modalities. For patients with recalcitrant disease, the traditional open débridement technique has been modified by multiple surgeons, with others relying on arthroscopic or even percutaneous procedures. Without a standard protocol (nonsurgical or surgical), surgeons need to keep abreast of established and evolving treatment options to effectively treat patients with lateral epicondylitis.

### Guidelines to becoming an expert elbow arthroscopist [^116KxPkm]. Arthroscopy (2007). Low credibility.

This report presents my guidelines for surgeon training and development of skills in the art of elbow arthroscopy. As elbow arthroscopy becomes more common, it is important to achieve greater levels of experience that will minimize the risk of complications because indications and techniques are growing in number and complexity. Indications for elbow arthroscopy that require diagnosis before open surgery include evaluation of instability; removal of loose bodies, spurs, and plica; irrigation and debridement of infection or open joints; evaluation for arthrofibrosis (with open nerve protection), lateral epicondylitis, arthritis, osteochondritis dissecans, fracture, bursectomy, synovectomy, stabilization, tendon repair, and nerve release or decompression.

### Is it time to reconsider the indications for surgery in patients with tennis elbow? [^116FvxTA]. The Bone & Joint Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

On an individual level, a steady half-life means that the duration of symptoms or length of follow-up could be largely irrelevant and provides little prognostic value. It also means that the future course is completely unpredictable. Recovery seems to be a random process akin to the biological half-life of drugs. A molecule lasting several half-lives is no different from a molecule that is eliminated first. This does not mean that a patient should expect their symptoms to halve every four months, but rather that the probability of recovery in future persists irrespective of the time passed.

While the underlying mechanisms for the half-life pattern are unclear, these findings have relevance for everyday clinical practice and future research. In this annotation we discuss what the findings mean for the usual practice of operating on patients whose symptoms fail to settle with nonoperative treatment. Second, we consider how the findings influence the interpretation of other studies. Finally, we discuss what our advice should be to patients who are frustrated by long-standing symptoms and seek advice about whether surgery should be undertaken.

### Fifty most-cited articles on lateral epicondylitis of the elbow [^116136bG]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusion

This study identifies the 50 most-cited articles on lateral epicondylitis or "tennis elbow" and includes foundational investigations that have provided knowledge and understanding of the underlying etiology, pathophysiology, and treatment. This list may be used to aid in the education of orthopaedic residency and fellowship trainees because it serves as a source for establishing a reading curriculum on lateral epicondylitis. Many of the articles included were randomized controlled trials showing the modern-day emphasis on evidence-based medicine to evaluate outcomes for a condition for which the optimal management remains controversial.

### Elbow arthroscopy: indications, techniques, outcomes, and complications [^111z9Ugw]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2014). Low credibility.

Elbow arthroscopy is a tool useful for the treatment of a variety of pathologies about the elbow. The major indications for elbow arthroscopy include débridement for septic elbow arthritis, synovectomy for inflammatory arthritis, débridement for osteoarthritis, loose body extraction, contracture release, treatment of osteochondral defects and selected fractures or instability, and tennis elbow release. Contraindications, technical considerations, and favorable outcomes following treatment with elbow arthroscopy require careful patient evaluation, a thorough understanding of anatomic principles, and proper patient positioning and portal selection to guide preoperative planning and overall patient care. Elbow arthroscopy is an effective procedure for the treatment of inflammatory arthritis, osteoarthritis, and lateral epicondylitis.

### Is it time to reconsider the indications for surgery in patients with tennis elbow? [^112bsjWR]. The Bone & Joint Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Tennis elbow (or lateral epicondylitis or lateral elbow tendinopathy) is a common condition causing lateral elbow pain and disability in middle-aged adults. Its prevalence is strongly associated with age, rising sharply after the age of 30 years, peaking between the ages of 45 and 65 years, and being rare after the age of 65 years.

Indirect evidence suggests that tennis elbow has a benign clinical course. A screening study found that between 1% and 2% of people between the ages of 35 and 55 years have typical clinical findings of tennis elbow, but the reported incidence in the same age group is less than half of that. - ⁠ This suggests that many patients with tennis elbow never see a doctor. Furthermore, about half of those who are diagnosed with tennis elbow only visit a doctor once or twice, and three-quarters are no longer seeking care three months after their initial visit. Another indicator of its excellent long-term prognosis is that despite the lack of a specific cure, the condition is rare in people aged > 65 years.

### Hydrothermal ablation in recurrent or chronic olecranon bursitis: a prospective study [^116gLLd4]. Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Olecranon bursitis can be difficult to treat, resulting in persistent or recurrent symptoms. Bursectomy is a frequently applied treatment option for refractory cases but has high complication rates. This is the first in vivo study to investigate the safety and efficacy of hydrothermal ablation, a new treatment modality for recurrent or chronic olecranon bursitis that aims to cause thermal obliteration of the bursal lining by irrigation with heated saline.

Methods

First, a pilot animal trial was set up to determine a safe irrigation temperature window. Second, in a human trial the bursae of patients with chronic, recurrent, or refractory olecranon bursitis were irrigated with a 3-mL/s flow of physiological saline for a duration of 180 seconds at temperatures between 50°C and 52°C. Patients were followed up for 6 months, allowing for assessment of the surgical site to screen for adverse events, volumetric ultrasonographic assessment of the bursae, and collection of the Quick Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand questionnaire (QuickDASH), Patient Global Impression Score, and Clinical Global Impression Score, as well as data on return to activities or work.

Results

Twenty-four elbows were prospectively included and underwent a full cycle of hydrothermal ablation. The mean age was 58.4 years (range 40.5–81.5), including 20 male and 4 female patients. None had clinical signs of septic bursitis. Bursal fluid cultures were positive in only 1 case. The average preoperative bursal volume was 11.18 mL (range 4.13–30.75). Eighteen of 24 elbows (75%) were successfully treated, showing a complete remission of symptoms or decided improvement within 6 weeks and without any signs of recurrence during the entire follow-up period of 6 months. The average reduction of ultrasonography-measured bursal volume was 91.9% in the group of patients who responded to treatment. In patients without recurrence, the mean QuickDASH scores before and after treatment were 13.6 (range 0–50) and 3.1 (range 0–27.5), respectively, showing a statistically significant improvement. All patients were able to fully return to work within 6 weeks after the index procedure. No serious adverse events were encountered. Moderate local adverse events were found in 2 patients. Increasing temperatures of irrigation did not result in a higher treatment efficacy.

Conclusion

Hydrothermal ablation at temperatures between 50°C and 52°C is a safe treatment option for recurrent or chronic olecranon bursitis with fewer complications than open bursectomy and a comparable efficacy.

### The predictive value of diagnostic sonography for the effectiveness of conservative treatment of tennis elbow [^115vHp2R]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

Tennis elbow is a common complaint. Several treatment strategies have been described, but an optimal strategy has not been identified. Sonographic imaging as a predictive factor has never been studied. The aim of our study was to determine the value of sonographic findings in predicting response to conservative therapy for tennis elbow. This was done in a randomized controlled trial in which the effectiveness of a brace only, physical therapy only, and a combination of both were compared.

Subjects and Methods

Patients with tennis elbow complaints were randomized. Sonography was performed before randomization in 57 patients. Outcome measures at 6 weeks' follow-up were success rate and decrease in pain (scale, 0–100). Data were analyzed using an intention-to-treat analysis.

Results

In only 75% of the imaged patients, sonographic abnormalities were identified and the clinical diagnosis could thus be confirmed. The following entities were identified: hypo- and hyperechogenicity, swelling, calcification, bursitis, enthesopathy, and tendinosis. The positive predictive value of sonography for the different entities varied between 0.78 and 0.82, and the negative predictive value ranged between 0.23 and 0.71. Predictive value was studied by subgroups of sonographic findings: hypoechoic, swelling present, enthesopathy, any entity present, and no entity present. We found no significant differences among the subgroups for either success rate (range, 40–54%) or mean decrease in pain (range, 16–28 percentage points).

Conclusion

No predictive value of sonography for the detection of abnormalities was identified in this study. Its diagnostic capability showed limited value. However, limitations in this study necessitate drawing definitive conclusions with care.

### Arthroscopic scapulothoracic bursectomy with and without superomedial angle scapuloplasty: a comparison of patient-reported outcomes [^112P2ZcM]. Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Operative treatment of scapulothoracic bursitis most commonly comprises arthroscopic scapulothoracic bursectomy with or without partial superomedial angle scapuloplasty. There is currently no consensus regarding whether or when scapuloplasty should be performed. Prior studies are limited to small case series, and optimal surgical indications are not yet established. The purposes of this study were (1) to retrospectively review patient-reported outcomes of arthroscopic treatment of scapulothoracic bursitis and (2) to compare outcomes between scapulothoracic bursectomy alone and bursectomy with scapuloplasty. We hypothesized that bursectomy with scapuloplasty would provide superior pain relief and functional improvement.

Materials and Methods

All cases of scapulothoracic débridement with or without scapuloplasty completed at a single academic center from 2007 through August 2020 were reviewed. Patient demographic characteristics, symptomatology data, physical examination findings, and corticosteroid injection response data were collected from the electronic medical record. Visual analog scale pain, American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons, Simple Shoulder Test, and Single Assessment Numeric Evaluation scores were collected. Comparisons between the group undergoing bursectomy alone and the group undergoing bursectomy with scapuloplasty were made using the Student t test for continuous variables and the Fisher exact test for categorical variables.

Results

Thirty patients underwent scapulothoracic bursectomy alone, and 38 patients underwent bursectomy with scapuloplasty. Final follow-up data were available for 56 of 68 cases (82%). Final postoperative visual analog scale pain scores (3.4 ± 2.2 and 2.8 ± 2.2, respectively; P = 0.351), American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons scores (75.8 ± 17.7 and 76.5 ± 22.5, respectively; P = 0.895), and Simple Shoulder Test scores (8.8 ± 2.3 and 9.5 ± 2.8, respectively; P = 0.340) were similar between the bursectomy-alone and bursectomy-with-scapuloplasty groups.

Conclusion

Both arthroscopic scapulothoracic bursectomy alone and bursectomy with scapuloplasty are effective treatments for scapulothoracic bursitis. Operative time is shorter without scapuloplasty. In this retrospective series, these procedures showed similar outcomes regarding shoulder function, pain, surgical complications, and rates of subsequent shoulder surgery. Further studies with a focus on 3-dimensional scapular morphology may help optimize patient selection for each of these procedures.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® chronic elbow pain [^113V6wwL]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Chronic elbow pain can be osseous, soft tissue, cartilaginous, and nerve related in etiology. Imaging plays an important role in differentiating between these causes of chronic elbow pain. This document provides recommendations for imaging of chronic elbow pain in adult patients. The ACR Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process support the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer-reviewed journals. Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances in which peer-reviewed literature is lacking or equivocal, experts may be the primary evidentiary source available to formulate a recommendation.

### Methylprednisolone acetate [^111YddGZ]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Suitable sites for intra-articular injection are the knee, ankle, wrist, elbow, shoulder, phalangeal, and hip joints. Since difficulty is not infrequently encountered in entering the hip joint, precautions should be taken to avoid any large blood vessels in the area. Joints not suitable for injection are those that are anatomically inaccessible such as the spinal joints and those like the sacroiliac joints that are devoid of synovial space. Treatment failures are most frequently the result of failure to enter the joint space. Little or no benefit follows injection into surrounding tissue. If failures occur when injections into the synovial spaces are certain, as determined by aspiration of fluid, repeated injections are usually futile.

If a local anesthetic is used prior to injection of methylprednisolone acetate injectable suspension, the anesthetic package insert should be read carefully and all the precautions observed.

2. Bursitis. The area around the injection site is prepared in a sterile way and a wheal at the site made with 1 percent procaine hydrochloride solution. A 20 to 24 gauge needle attached to a dry syringe is inserted into the bursa and the fluid aspirated. The needle is left in place and the aspirating syringe changed for a small syringe containing the desired dose. After injection, the needle is withdrawn and a small dressing applied.

### Local perforator flap for reconstruction of deep tissue defects in the elbow area [^111iVZfP]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2003). Low credibility.

Limited deep tissue defects in the elbow area can occur after burns, advanced bursitis, and inflammatory processes, to name a few. Reconstruction is complicated because sufficient tissue with adequate elasticity and strength has to be transferred. Often major surgical procedures such as free tissue transfer are considered. A novel method for reconstruction of deep tissue defects in the elbow area, based on a single perforator artery and vein, is described. Perforator vessels are identified preoperatively using color Doppler ultrasonography, and a flap from the upper arm is rotated 180 degrees. The authors describe the successful treatment of two patients. The surgical technique is comparatively simple and can be performed with regional anesthesia. Postoperative recovery is short and skin sensibility is retained. The authors suggest that local, single perforator flaps can be considered as a first alternative in treatment of limited, deep tissue defects in the elbow area, especially for elderly or severely ill patients.

### Persistent tennis elbow symptoms have little prognostic value: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112qYj8j]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Tennis elbow is a common painful enthesopathy of the lateral elbow that limits upper limb function and frequently results in lost time at work. Surgeons often recommend surgery if symptoms persist despite nonsurgical management, but operations for tennis elbow are inconsistent in their efficacy, and what we know about those operations often derives from observational studies that assume the condition does not continue to improve over time. This assumption is largely untested, and it may not be true; meta-analyzing results from the control arms of tennis elbow studies can help us to evaluate this premise, but to our knowledge, this has not been done.

Questions/Purposes

The aims of this systematic review were to describe the course of (1) global improvement, (2) pain, and (3) disability in participants who received no active treatment (placebo or no treatment) in published randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on tennis elbow. We also assessed (4) whether the duration of symptoms or placebo effect is associated with differences in symptom trajectories.

Methods

We searched MEDLINE, Embase, and CENTRAL from database inception to August 12, 2019, for trials including participants with tennis elbow and a placebo or a no-treatment arm and a minimum follow-up duration of 6 months. There were no language restrictions or exclusion criteria. We extracted global improvement, pain, and disability outcomes. We used the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool to assess the risk of bias of included trials. To estimate the typical course of tennis elbow without active treatment, we pooled global improvement (the proportion of participants who reported feeling much better or completely recovered), mean pain, and mean disability using baseline, 1-month, 3-month, 6-month, and 12-month follow-up data. We transformed pain and disability data from the original papers so that at each timepoint the relevant outcome was expressed as change relative to baseline to account for different baseline values. We used meta-regression to assess whether the placebo effect or duration of symptoms before enrollment was associated with differences in symptom trajectories. We included 24 trials with 1085 participants who received no active treatment.

Results

The number of patients who were not improved decreased exponentially over time. The half-life of global improvement was between 2.5 and 3 months (that is, every 2.5 to 3 months, 50% of the remaining symptomatic patients reported complete recovery or greatly improved symptoms). At 1 year, 89% (189 of 213; 95% CI 80% to 97%) of patients experienced global improvement. The mean pain and disability followed a similar pattern, halving every 3 to 4 months. Eighty-eight percent of pain (95% CI 70% to 100%) and 85% of disability (95% CI 60% to 100%) had resolved by 1 year. The mean duration of symptoms before trial enrollment was not associated with differences in symptom trajectories. The trajectories of the no-treatment and placebo arms were similar, indicating that the placebo effect of the studied active treatments likely is negligible.

Conclusion

Based on the placebo or no-treatment control arms of randomized trials, about 90% of people with untreated tennis elbow achieve symptom resolution at 1 year. The probability of resolution appears to remain constant throughout the first year of follow-up and does not depend on previous symptom duration, undermining the rationale that surgery is appropriate if symptoms persist beyond a certain point of time. We recommend that clinicians inform people who are frustrated with persisting symptoms that this is not a cause for apprehension, given that spontaneous improvement is about as likely during the subsequent few months as it was early after the symptoms first appeared. Because of the high likelihood of spontaneous recovery, any active intervention needs to be justified by high levels of early efficacy and little or no risk to outperform watchful waiting.

### Efficacy of empiric antibiotic management of septic olecranon bursitis without bursal aspiration in emergency department patients [^111B9w6a]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Patients with symptomatic olecranon bursitis commonly present to the emergency department (ED) for evaluation. Up to 50% of all olecranon bursitis cases in the ED are septic in nature. It is important to recognize and appropriately treat these cases to prevent complications including septic arthritis and sepsis.

The ED evaluation and diagnosis of septic bursitis is widely variable and often based on anecdotal evidence. Diagnostic aspiration of the olecranon bursa to assess for septic bursitis is commonly recommended and performed, despite the paucity of evidence to support this practice. Aspiration may increase the risk for complications including chronic fistula formation, infection, and need for a future bursectomy.

There are only limited studies focused on ED evaluation and management of septic bursitis. Additionally, the efficacy of conservative management of suspected septic olecranon bursitis with empiric antibiotic therapy is unknown. The objective of our study was to describe outcomes associated with empiric antibiotic therapy without bursal aspiration among ED patients with suspected septic olecranon bursitis.

### Common superficial bursitis [^112EJvpa]. American Family Physician (2017). Low credibility.

Superficial bursitis most often occurs in the olecranon and prepatellar bursae. Less common locations are the superficial infrapatellar and subcutaneous (superficial) calcaneal bursae. Chronic microtrauma (e.g., kneeling on the prepatellar bursa) is the most common cause of superficial bursitis. Other causes include acute trauma/hemorrhage, inflammatory disorders such as gout or rheumatoid arthritis, and infection (septic bursitis). Diagnosis is usually based on clinical presentation, with a particular focus on signs of septic bursitis. Ultrasonography can help distinguish bursitis from cellulitis. Blood testing (white blood cell count, inflammatory markers) and magnetic resonance imaging can help distinguish infectious from noninfectious causes. If infection is suspected, bursal aspiration should be performed and fluid examined using Gram stain, crystal analysis, glucose measurement, blood cell count, and culture. Management depends on the type of bursitis. Acute traumatic/hemorrhagic bursitis is treated conservatively with ice, elevation, rest, and analgesics; aspiration may shorten the duration of symptoms. Chronic microtraumatic bursitis should be treated conservatively, and the underlying cause addressed. Bursal aspiration of microtraumatic bursitis is generally not recommended because of the risk of iatrogenic septic bursitis. Although intrabursal corticosteroid injections are sometimes used to treat microtraumatic bursitis, high-quality evidence demonstrating any benefit is unavailable. Chronic inflammatory bursitis (e.g., gout, rheumatoid arthritis) is treated by addressing the underlying condition, and intrabursal corticosteroid injections are often used. For septic bursitis, antibiotics effective against Staphylococcus aureus are generally the initial treatment, with surgery reserved for bursitis not responsive to antibiotics or for recurrent cases. Outpatient antibiotics may be considered in those who are not acutely ill; patients who are acutely ill should be hospitalized and treated with intravenous antibiotics.

### Comparison of treatments for frozen shoulder: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115FN7ZV]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Adhesive capsulitis, also known as frozen shoulder, is a common shoulder concern manifesting in progressive loss of glenohumeral movements coupled with pain. It is a fibroproliferative tissue fibrosis, and although the immunobiological advances in other diseases have helped dissect the pathophysiology of this condition, overall, the molecular mechanisms underpinning it remain poorly understood.,

Frozen shoulder manifests clinically as shoulder pain with progressive restricted movement, both active and passive, along with normal radiographic scans of the glenohumeral joint. It classically progresses prognostically through 3 overlapping stages of pain (stage 1, lasting 2–9 months), stiffness (stage 2, lasting 4–12 months), and recovery (stage 3, lasting 5–24 months). However, this is an estimated time frame, and many patients can still experience symptoms at 6 years. A primary care–based observational study estimated its incidence as 2.4 per 100 000 individuals per year, with prevalence varying from less than 1% to 2% of the population.

A true evidence-based model for its medical management has not been defined, with a wide spectrum of operative and nonoperative treatments available. From the international to departmental level, management strategies vary widely, reflecting the lack of good-quality evidence. The British Elbow and Shoulder Society/British Orthopaedic Association (BESS/BOA) has published recommendations in a patient care pathway for frozen shoulder, with a step-up approach in terms of invasiveness advised. The UK Frozen Shoulder Trial, a randomized parallel trial comparing the clinical and cost-effectiveness of early structured physiotherapy, manipulation under anesthetic (MUA), and arthroscopic capsular release (ACR) is currently under way. The aim of this systematic review is to present the available evidence relevant to treatment and outcomes for frozen shoulder with the ultimate objective of guiding clinical practice, both in primary and secondary care.

### Four common types of bursitis: diagnosis and management [^114WQg7M]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2011). Low credibility.

Bursitis is a common cause of musculoskeletal pain and often prompts orthopaedic consultation. Bursitis must be distinguished from arthritis, fracture, tendinitis, and nerve pathology. Common types of bursitis include prepatellar, olecranon, trochanteric, and retrocalcaneal. Most patients respond to nonsurgical management, including ice, activity modification, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. In cases of septic bursitis, oral antibiotics may be administered. Local corticosteroid injection may be used in the management of prepatellar and olecranon bursitis; however, steroid injection into the retrocalcaneal bursa may adversely affect the biomechanical properties of the Achilles tendon. Surgical intervention may be required for recalcitrant bursitis, such as refractory trochanteric bursitis.

### Evidence-based indications for elbow arthroscopy [^117AS7c5]. Arthroscopy (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose

The purpose was to review the literature on the outcomes of elbow arthroscopy and to make evidence-based recommendations for or against elbow arthroscopy for the treatment of various conditions. Our hypothesis was that the evidence would support the use of elbow arthroscopy in the management of common elbow conditions.

Methods

A literature search was performed by use of the PubMed database in October 2010. All therapeutic studies investigating the results of treatment with elbow arthroscopy were analyzed for outcomes and complications. The literature specific to common elbow arthroscopy indications was summarized and was assigned a grade of recommendation based on the available evidence.

Results

There is fair-quality evidence for elbow arthroscopy in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis of the elbow and lateral epicondylitis (grade B recommendation). There is poor-quality evidence for, rather than against, the arthroscopic treatment of degenerative arthritis, osteochondritis dissecans, radial head resection, loose bodies, post-traumatic arthrofibrosis, posteromedial impingement, excision of a plica, and fractures of the capitellum, coronoid process, and radial head (grade C(f) recommendation). There is insufficient evidence to give a recommendation for or against the arthroscopic treatment of posterolateral rotatory instability and septic arthritis (grade I recommendation).

Conclusions

The available evidence supports the use of elbow arthroscopy in the management of the majority of conditions where it is currently used. The quality of the evidence, however, is generally fair to poor.

### Andolecranon bursitis / osteomyelitis: a case involving surgical and antibiotic treatment [^115Ps7x1]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

Discussion

To our knowledge this is the first reported case of infected olecranon bursitis with the causal organisms being S. epidermidis and P. acnes, as shown in cultures from a tissue specimen. The association with P. acnes is the most unusual aspect of this case. Despite the shortcomings of the initial aspects of treatment for this case, including the initial courses of inadequate antibiotic treatments (eg, the primary care physician's use of low dose ceftriaxone and the surgeon's use of vancomycin instead of a beta-lactam antibiotic for P. acnes), this case is reported in order to help other medical doctors and surgeons avoid these pitfalls. Additionally, at the time when these decisions were made our literature searches (PubMed and Google) of 'P. acnes' and 'olecranon' and 'olecranon bursitis' failed to reveal any cases.

P. acnes is found in hair follicles (pilosebaceous glands) especially around the shoulder area, and is more commonly found in men than women. P. acnes are small-to-medium Gram-positive rod-shaped bacteria that exhibit facultative anaerobic metabolism. This organism is primarily known for being involved in the pathogenesis of chronic inflammatory acne and other chronic conditions or infections such as prosthetic shoulder and hip infections, silicone breast prosthetic infections, endocarditis of prosthetic and native aortic valves, corneal infections, postoperative endophthalmitis, focal intracranial infections, cerebrospinal fluid shunt infections and sarcoidosis.

In orthopaedics, P. acnes has become notorious as an indolent and often difficult to diagnose opportunistic pathogen in spine and shoulder infections. This likely reflects the proximity of these sites to areas where there are relatively high concentrations of pilosebaceous glands. For example, Propionibacterium have become the most common bacteria to be recovered at surgical revision of a failed shoulder arthroplasty. P. acnes are a much less common cause of infection in elbow prosthetic arthroplasty, likely reflecting the very low prevalence of this organism in the cutaneous tissues of the elbow. Somerson et al reviewed 20 studies that reported deep infection rates after total elbow replacement. Of the six studies that reported organisms grown on culture (1667 cases), P. acnes only represented 0.7% of the infected cases (11 of 1667 cases).

### Prevention and treatment of elbow stiffness [^1112E6Y1]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

The elbow is as prone to stiffness as it is essential for upper-extremity function. The elbow is a highly constrained synovial hinge joint that frequently becomes stiff after injury. Elbow contracture is challenging to treat, and therefore prevention is of paramount importance. When this approach fails, nonoperative followed by operative treatment modalities can be pursued. In the future, efforts to prevent and treat elbow stiffness may target the basic science mechanisms involved.

### Andolecranon bursitis / osteomyelitis: a case involving surgical and antibiotic treatment [^114ATsBC]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

In February 2015, a 63-year-old man (height: 178 cm; weight: 82 kg; body mass index: 26) sustained a punctate laceration on the posterior aspect of his left elbow. At that time he was otherwise healthy and was not taking any medications. He had a medical history of poliomyelitis as an adolescent with mild residual elbow contractures as a result. He was an avid swimmer and swam for exercise three to four times each week at a public pool. He noticed the left elbow laceration after striking the posterior aspect of his left elbow on a metal railing while swimming in a public pool. Two days later erythema and oedema developed around the wound. Five days later he saw his primary care physician who diagnosed this as cellulitis with infected olecranon bursitis. The bursa was lanced to allow it to drain and one culture was obtained from the scant fluid.

### Andolecranon bursitis / osteomyelitis: a case involving surgical and antibiotic treatment [^1121WXML]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

Background

The olecranon bursa is thought to be at increased risk for infection due to its superficial location. Septic olecranon bursitis is most commonly caused by bacterial infection with Staphylococcus aureus. Ho et al found S. aureus to be the predominant cause of infection in 72%–92% of cases that they studied.

Here we report a unique case of a 63-year-old man who sustained a punctate laceration on the posterior aspect of his left elbow and acquired a rare polymicrobial infection (Propionibacterium acnes and Staphylococcus epidermidis) in his olecranon bursa. There was also the possibility of concurrent olecranon osteomyelitis as seen on MRI. The infection was treated successfully with intravenous antibiotics and soft-tissue debridements.

### Efficacy of nonoperative treatments for lateral epicondylitis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113WjNJg]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Lateral epicondylitis is a common overuse injury affecting approximately 1 to 3 percent of the population. Although symptoms may disappear spontaneously within 1 year, the clinical guidelines for conservative treatment are not clear. The authors' objective was to examine the outcomes of nonsurgical treatments for lateral epicondylitis through a meta-analysis and provide a treatment recommendation using the available evidence.

Methods

The authors searched the PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, and Web of Science databases to identify primary research articles studying conservative treatments (electrophysiotherapy, physical therapy, and injections) for lateral epicondylitis. The authors included randomized controlled trials published in peer-reviewed journals. Data related to outcomes (pain, grip strength, Patient-Rated Tennis Elbow Evaluation score, and Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand score) and complications were extracted.

Results

Fifty-eight randomized controlled trials were included in the meta-analysis. Electrophysiotherapy was effective in improving pain [mean difference, -10.0 (95 percent CI, -13.8 to -6.1)], Patient-Rated Tennis Elbow Evaluation score [mean difference, -10.7 (95 percent CI, -16.3 to -5.0)], and Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand score [mean difference, -11.9 (95 percent CI, -15.8 to -7.9)]; and physical therapy improved pain [mean difference, -6.0 (95 percent CI, -9.7 to -2.3)] and Patient-Rated Tennis Elbow Evaluation scores [mean difference, -7.5 (95 percent CI, -11.8 to -3.2)] compared to placebo. Injections did not improve any outcome measures. Patients who received electrophysiotherapy and injections reported higher adverse effects than physical therapy patients.

Conclusions

Patients who received electrophysiotherapy and physical therapy reported statistically and clinically improved scores in pain and function compared to placebo. Injections may put patients at higher risk for adverse effects compared to other conservative treatments. When managing lateral epicondylitis conservatively, electrophysiotherapy and physical therapy should be prioritized before other interventions.

### Management of lateral elbow tendinopathy: one size does not fit all [^117HgU3V]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2015). Low credibility.

Synopsis Clear guidelines for the clinical management of individuals with lateral elbow tendinopathy (LET) are hampered by many proposed interventions and the condition's prognosis, ranging from immediate resolution of symptoms following simple advice in some patients to long-lasting problems, regardless of treatment, in others. This is compounded by our lack of understanding of the complexity of the underlying pathophysiology of LET. In this article, we collate evidence and expert opinion on the pathophysiology, clinical presentation, and differential diagnosis of LET. Factors that might provide prognostic value or direction for physical rehabilitation, such as the presence of neck pain, tendon tears, or central sensitization, are canvassed. Clinical recommendations for physical rehabilitation are provided, including the prescription of exercise and adjunctive physical therapy and pharmacotherapy. A preliminary algorithm, including targeted interventions, for the management of subgroups of patients with LET based on identified prognostic factors is proposed. Further research is needed to evaluate whether such an approach may lead to improved outcomes and more efficient resource allocation. J Orthop Sports Phys Ther 2015;45(11):938–949.

### Andolecranon bursitis / osteomyelitis: a case involving surgical and antibiotic treatment [^116rJkpV]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

Predisposing factors that increase the risk of acquired septic olecranon bursitis are persistent pressure on the bursa (eg, due to work demands), corticosteroid therapy, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, gout and other conditions that reduce immunity. As a child our patient had poliomyelitis, which could increase the potential for opportunistic infections due to an 'immunocompromised cutaneous district' because the virus has been shown to result in regional impairments in nerve conduction that could lead to decreased peptidergic stimulation of immunocompetent cells. Although poliomyelitis primarily affects motor neurons, there is evidence that sensory neurons are also impaired. The novel concept of a selectively diminished cutaneous and subcutaneous inflammatory response due to regional poliomyelitis-related nerve damage is further supported by case reports that detail the sparing of a poliomyelitis affected limb from psoriasis, joint sparing in a patient with unilateral psoriatic arthritis with a history of hemiplegia, and sparing of limbs affected by past infection with poliomyelitis in patients with systemic sclerosis. However, although our patient's poliomyelitis infection did permanently affect the joints of his upper extremities (primarily with mild elbow contractures), there is no clear evidence that his chronologically remote polio infection contributed to his P. acnes olecranon bursitis. A link between his P. acnes olecranon bursitis/osteomyelitis also seems unlikely because he did not have any prior history of atypical or unusual infections.

Patient's perspective

I am pleased with the final outcome, but in the first 3–4 weeks it was clear that the antibiotics choices were not working. I am grateful to return to swimming and all work-related activities.

Learning points

Propionibacterium acnes and Staphylococcus epidermidis can be rare pathogenic causes of olecranon bursitis and osteomyelitis due to their ubiquitous presence on the skin.
Wound cultures taken in these conditions must be held for adequate time to detect growth of these organisms and guide appropriate treatment decisions.
Penicillin-based antibiotics with a beta-lactamase inhibitor provide coverage for P. acnes and is a viable treatment option for bone and soft tissue infections with this pathogen.

After obtaining the tissue culture, but prior to receiving the culture results 9 days later, intravenous vancomycin (1.5 g two times per day) had been started by the surgeon. This treatment was continued for 2 weeks. No addition cultures were obtained. Because of continuing drainage and the lack of the expected robust erythematous granulation tissue, ertapenem (1 g once daily) was then added and this two antibiotic treatment was continued for an additional 2 weeks. However, the clinical response to this double antibiotic treatment continued to be poor. Because of this an infectious disease specialist (MRO) was consulted. The consultant stopped ertapenem and started piperacillin/tazobactam 4.5 g intravenously every 8 hours. This change was based on data showing that this penicillin-based antibiotic with a beta-lactamase inhibitor would provide coverage for P. acnes in addition to: (1) continuing broad-spectrum coverage primarily for the possibility that another pathogen (in addition to S. epidermidis) was present but did not grow in subsequent cultures and (2) more aggressively treating the olecranon osteomyelitis.

During the intravenous antibiotic treatments, consecutive weekly irrigation and debridement procedures of the soft tissues were performed in our clinic. These procedures included superficial curettage of the wound base and margins. Two additional soft-tissue irrigation and debridements were done in the operating room. The first of these operating room irrigation and debridements was intended for wound closure. However, the wound was not ready for closure because the granulation tissue was inadequate (figure 1). As described above, this was when piperacillin/tazobactam was added. During the entire course of treatment the bone was never exposed; it was always covered with periosteum/granulation tissue.

### Factors associated with revision surgery for olecranon bursitis after bursectomy [^114yTadv]. Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The primary aim of our study was to identify the factors associated with revision surgery after bursal excision in patients with olecranon bursitis. The secondary aims were to describe the revision rate after bursectomy and to assess which factors are associated with flap surgery after bursectomy and describe the most common complications after bursectomy of the olecranon bursa.

Methods

We included 191 adult patients with olecranon bursitis who underwent olecranon bursa excision between January 2002 and October 2018. Patients who were pregnant, patients with incomplete records of the primary surgical procedure, and patients who underwent bursectomy during elbow arthroplasty were excluded. After manual chart review, we found that 22 patients had undergone revision surgery. Bivariate analysis was performed to assess the association between revision surgery and patient characteristics, comorbidities, and clinical characteristics. Additionally, we collected data regarding postoperative complications and intraoperative variables such as the use of drains, vacuum assisted closure therapy, and flap surgery.

Results

The overall revision rate in our cohort was 11.5% (22 of 191 patients). Bivariate analysis showed that patients who underwent revision surgery were more frequently women (P = 0.004), more often had a history of ipsilateral (P = 0.020) or contralateral (P = 0.012) olecranon bursitis, and more often received a diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis (P = 0.001) or diabetes mellitus (P = 0.019). The most common complications were delayed wound healing (n = 8, 4.2%) and osteomyelitis (n = 8, 4.2%). Flap surgery was performed in 5 patients (2.6%). Bivariate analysis showed that patients with rheumatoid arthritis underwent flap surgery more frequently (P = 0.011).

Conclusion

The revision rate after bursectomy for olecranon bursitis was 11.5% (22 of 191 patients). Patients with rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes mellitus, or a history of ipsilateral and contralateral olecranon bursitis and female patients underwent revision surgery after bursectomy for olecranon bursitis more frequently. In addition, patients with rheumatoid arthritis underwent flap surgery after bursectomy more frequently.

Question 4: What is the Evidence for Treatment of Tendinopathies Using Injectable Biologics?

In the current and subsequent sections of the guideline, we summarize evidence for injectable biologics for specific painful indications. Study data are also summarized in–.

Lateral Epicondylitis

Lateral epicondylitis (LE), or tennis elbow, describes an overuse injury of the extensor tendons attaching to the lateral humerus. While typically self-limited, injuries failing the initial healing response can lead to chronic, degenerative tendinopathy. Consequently, the focus of treatment may shift from anti-inflammatory medication to regenerative approaches. Corticosteroid injections (CSI) have traditionally been used in LE refractory to conservative management. While they can provide short-term symptomatic relief, their use is increasingly discouraged due to questionable efficacy, high rates of recurrence, and risk of further tissue damage. Dextrose prolotherapy has yielded outcomes comparable or superior to CSI and placebo. A meta-analysis of nine trials demonstrated positive outcomes with dextrose prolotherapy, although there was a moderate risk of bias.

The use of autologous blood products has gained interest as an alternative intervention for recalcitrant LE. RCTs comparing either leukocyte-rich PRP (LR-PRP) or leukocyte-poor PRP (LP-PRP) to placebo demonstrated significant improvements in pain and function with both types over a year of follow-up.RCTs also reported superiority of PRP injections to CSI at 3 months to 2 years. Some trials reported that CSI may be equivalent or more effective for pain relief in the short-term, but this effect declined over time. Meta-analyses have reiterated this association: CSI demonstrates efficacy for 2 to 8 weeks, while PRP remains superior in the longer term (3 months to 2 years).PRP injections also yielded similar benefits to surgical intervention in multiple studies. However, they have not demonstrated efficacy as an adjuvant to surgery or tenotomy. Unlike PRP, autologous conditioned plasma (ACP) injections failed to show significant improvements versus placebo over 6 months in small RCTs. However, they were superior to CSI in a larger RCT with 1-year follow-up.

This report describes a 63-year-old generally healthy male with septic olecranon bursitis caused by Propionibacterium acnes The patient sustained a small laceration after striking the posterior aspect of his left elbow on a metal railing when he was at a public swimming pool. We concluded that P. acnes was not initially detected because cultures were only kept for 5days. Consequently, initial antibiotic treatment failed. P. acnes and Staphylococcus epidermidis grew in a subsequent tissue culture. The infection did not respond to intravenous vancomycin although soft-tissue debridements were done. This likely reflected the presence of olecranon osteomyelitis (seen on MRI scans) in addition to inadequate treatment with this antibiotic in the setting of a polymicrobial infection. Eventually, the infection was eradicated with multiple soft-tissue debridements in addition to the continuation of vancomycin with daily intravenous piperacillin/tazobactam that was added for the final 4weeks of antibiotic treatment.

Figure 1
PRISMA flow diagram of included studies. PRISMA, Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses.

Eligibility

Included studies had a randomised design and compared surgery to any mode of non-surgical management for any type of tendinopathy in terms of at least one of the following outcomes: 'pain', 'function', 'ROM', 'force/strength', 'patient satisfaction', 'treatment success', 'QoL', 'complications'. Non-randomised observational studies, case reports, case series and literature reviews were excluded. Participants had to be over 18 years of age with a clinical diagnosis of tendinopathy with or without radiological signs. Studies including patients with full tendon tears were excluded. Duration of symptoms/signs was not a criterion, neither was length of conservative treatment and follow-up. Language criterion was not applied.

Search strategy

A thorough literature search was conducted by two of the authors (DC and CC) independently via Medline, EMBASE, Scopus and CINAHL in March 2018, with the following Boolean operators: '(tendinopathy OR tendinosis OR tendinitis OR tendonitis OR tennis elbow OR jumper's knee OR lateral elbow tendinopathy OR lateral epicondylitis OR rotator cuff disease OR shoulder impingement OR patellar OR Achilles) AND (surgery OR surgical management OR surgical treatment OR tenotomy OR open surgery OR arthroscopic surgery) AND (conservative management OR conservative treatment OR physiotherapy OR eccentric exercises OR eccentric strengthening OR stretching OR shock-wave therapy OR ESWT OR extracorporeal shock wave therapy OR ultrasound OR iontophoresis OR laser OR LLLT OR polidocanol OR sclerotherapy OR botox OR botulinum toxin OR GTN OR glyceryl trinitrate OR nitroglycerin OR corticosteroid injections OR platelet rich plasma OR PRP OR autologous blood OR sham surgery)'.

Medical Subject Heading terms were not used to minimise the risk of missing relevant articles. Review articles were used to identify eligible articles that were missed at the initial search.

### Case report: olecranon bursitis due toin an immunocompromised patient [^113QJJBD]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2019). Medium credibility.

Human protothecosis is a rare algal infection caused by Prototheca; it is a ubiquitous achlorophyllic alga, which rarely causes human disease. Currently, the pathogenesis remains unclear and no treatment options have been elucidated. We present a case of olecranon bursitis caused by Prototheca wickerhamii in an immunocompromised patient. A 45-year-old man presented with left elbow pain after scraping his elbow on a tree. He reported significant pain and swelling of the elbow after injury, which resolved without intervention. He was diagnosed with HIV/AIDS infection and started on antiretroviral therapy. Afterward, he experienced recurrent elbow swelling and pain; an incision and drainage was performed and cultures demonstrated P. wickerhamii. Unsuccessful treatment with oral voriconazole led to an attempt at therapy with parental amphotericin and oral doxycycline; however the patient left against medical advice. He presented to our facility and both parental amphotericin and doxycycline were initiated with planned outpatient bursectomy. He clinically improved on that regimen but left against medical advice before completing his recommended course of IV amphotericin and oral doxycycline. Patients diagnosed with disseminated protothecosis can have a mortality rate upward of 67%. Given the rarity of this pathogen, no official treatment guidelines exist and there are few studies analyzing the antimicrobial susceptibility of Prototheca. Management is challenging because of slow-growing nature of the algae, paucity of research studies, and limited susceptibility of this pathogen. This case adds to the limited body of literature by demonstrating the clinical presentation of protothecosis and highlighting the pathology and current treatment options.

### Conservative treatment of work-related upper limb disorders: a review [^114fVEqP]. Occupational Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Aim

The literature review was carried out to identify and summarize the evidence-base for conservative clinical management of upper limb disorders (ULDs) including specific disorders and non-specific ULDs.

Method

Keywords were identified through a scoping study and guidance from the project sponsor. A number of databases were searched including Web of Knowledge, Pub Med, Medline, Ergonomics Online, the Cochrane Library and BMJ Clinical Evidence for the years 1993–2004. Abstracts were obtained for papers identified in the search and full papers were obtained for literature, which included diagnostic methods, conservative treatments, new data or results or systematic reviews.

Results

The review identified that there is evidence for the efficacy of conservative treatments for the management of carpal tunnel syndrome, epicondylitis, rotator cuff tendonitis and bicipital tendonitis and tension neck syndrome. There was no evidence found to support or refute conservative treatment of tenosynovitis, tendonitis, de Quervain's disease or diffuse non-specific ULDs.

Conclusion

The evidence reviewed was not always of good quality and data gaps including methodological design issues need to be addressed by future research.

You do not have to play tennis to get tennis elbow-a very common problem for people who do lots of repetitive movements of the wrist, forearm and elbow, such as carpentry, painting or racquet sports. Most people with tennis elbow feel pain on the outside of their elbow and upper forearm. Experts in managing elbow pain developed a guideline for rehabilitation clinicians to use to help you understand more about tennis elbow. Here, we explain what the guidelines say about how to diagnose tennis elbow (sometimes called lateral elbow pain or lateral elbow tendinopathy), the specific treatments your physical therapist might offer you to help manage pain and improve the mobility of your elbow, and the types of exercises you could do to strengthen the muscles in your wrist and forearm.

### Empirical treatment of uncomplicated septic olecranon bursitis without aspiration [^112qd9GH]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Although aspiration of septic olecranon bursitis is recommended in the literature, no high-level evidence exists to support this practice. The purpose of this study was to retrospectively compare the results of traditional bursal aspiration (TBA) with empirical management without aspiration (EM). We hypothesized that EM of uncomplicated septic olecranon bursitis results in resolution, with fewer chronic draining sinuses and less progression to bursectomy.

Methods

We performed a retrospective review of all cases of septic olecranon bursitis seen by the orthopedic surgery department at a single tertiary referral center over a 5-year period. Cases were manually reviewed to determine patient demographics, management, and treatment results. The primary outcome was success of nonsurgical management versus requirement for surgical bursectomy.

Results

Thirty cases of uncomplicated septic olecranon bursitis were identified within the study period. Eleven patients were initially managed with TBA (performed by an emergency or primary care physician prior to orthopedic consultation), resulting in 11 positive cultures. Only 1 of these prompted a change of antibiotic management, and despite this information, 5 patients required a second course of antibiotics for incomplete resolution. Eight of the TBA cases went on to bursectomy. Nineteen patients underwent EM. Sixteen of these cases resolved with a single course of empirical antibiotics, and 3 (16%) cases required a second antibiotic course. One patient had a recurrence of symptoms 2 months after resolution with a single course of empirical antibiotics. This resolved with a second course of oral antibiotics. No patients who underwent EM went on to require bursectomy. The number needed to harm when aspiration was performed was 1.46.

Conclusions

We found EM of uncomplicated septic olecranon bursitis to be effective. Although 1 recurrence did occur in the EM group, no other complications occurred. Empirical management without aspiration may be considered in cases of uncomplicated septic olecranon bursitis.

### Methylprednisolone acetate, bupivacaine hydrochloride, povidone-iodine (physicians EZ use M-pred) [^113gyoBD]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Suitable sites for intra-articular injection are the knee, ankle, wrist, elbow, shoulder, phalangeal, and hip joints. Since difficulty is not infrequently encountered in entering the hip joint, precautions should be taken to avoid any large blood vessels in the area. Joints not suitable for injection are those that are anatomically inaccessible such as the spinal joints and those like the sacroiliac joints that are devoid of synovial space. Treatment failures are most frequently the result of failure to enter the joint space. Little or no benefit follows injection into surrounding tissue. If failures occur when injections into the synovial spaces are certain, as determined by aspiration of fluid, repeated injections are usually futile.

If a local anesthetic is used prior to injection of Methylprednisolone acetate injectable suspension, the anesthetic package insert should be read carefully and all the precautions observed.

Although lateral elbow pain and medial ulnar collateral ligament injury are common musculoskeletal pathologies in overhead athletes, the evidence supporting specific interventions for managing these conditions is scarce. Management of these conditions has been guided mostly by expert opinion rather than empirical evidence, yet the lack of comparative data in the literature has not negatively affected return-to-play rates following surgery. However, an understanding of what is known regarding unimodal and multimodal treatments for lateral elbow pain and medial ulnar collateral ligament injury is needed for clinicians to select evidence-based treatment pathways and highlight what is not known to develop future high-quality investigations.

### Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for treating lateral elbow pain in adults [^116r53QE]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Lateral elbow pain, or tennis elbow, is a common condition causing pain in the elbow and forearm and lack of strength and function of the elbow and wrist. It is often treated with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), either orally or by topical application.

Objectives

To assess effectiveness of NSAIDs (oral or topical) in the treatment of adults with lateral elbow pain with respect to symptom (pain) reduction, improvement in function, grip strength and adverse effects.

Search Strategy

We searched the Musculoskeletal Review Group's trials register database, the Cochrane Clinical Trials Register (Cochrane Library issue 2, 2001), MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE and SCISEARCH up to June 2001.

Selection Criteria

Randomised and pseudo randomised trials in all languages of NSAIDs (oral or topical) compared to placebo or another intervention, or comparing two NSAIDs (oral or topical) to each other, in adults with lateral elbow pain (tennis elbow). Outcomes of interest were pain, function, disability and quality of life, strength, participant satisfaction with treatment and adverse effect.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers independently applied selection criteria and assessed study quality.

Main Results

Fourteen trials were included in the review. Few trials used intention to treat analysis, and the sample size of most was small. The median follow up was 2 weeks (range 1–12 weeks). There is evidence that topical NSAIDs are significantly more effective than placebo with respect to pain [weighted main difference = -1.88, (95% confidence intervals -2.54 to -1.21)] and participant satisfaction [relative risk 0.39, (95% confidence intervals 0.23 to 0.66)] in the short term, and this finding is robust against the possible bias introduced by the inclusion of unblinded trials and publication bias. The adverse effects reported were minor. Only two included trials assessed the effect of oral NSAID and these were not able to be pooled. There is some evidence for short term benefit with respect to pain and function from oral NSAIDs, but this benefit was not sustained. Significantly more gastrointestinal adverse effects were reported by those taking oral NSAIDs [relative risk = 3.17, (95% confidence intervals 1.35 to 7.41)]. In the short term there may be some advantage in steroid injection over oral NSAID [patient's perception of benefit relative risk = 3.06, (95% confidence intervals 1.55 to 6.06)], but this was not sustained in the longer term.

Reviewer's Conclusions

There is some support for the use of topical NSAIDs to relieve lateral elbow pain at least in the short term. There remains insufficient evidence to recommend or discourage the use of oral NSAID, although it appears injection may be more effective than oral NSAID in the short term. A direct comparison between topical and oral NSAID has not been made and so no conclusions can be drawn regarding the best method of administration.

Suitable sites for intra-articular injection are the knee, ankle, wrist, elbow, shoulder, phalangeal, and hip joints. Since difficulty is not infrequently encountered in entering the hip joint, precautions should be taken to avoid any large blood vessels in the area. Joints not suitable for injection are those that are anatomically inaccessible such as the spinal joints and those like the sacroiliac joints that are devoid of synovial space. Treatment failures are most frequently the result of failure to enter the joint space. Little or no benefit follows injection into surrounding tissue. If failures occur when injections into the synovial spaces are certain, as determined by aspiration of fluid, repeated injections are usually futile.

If a local anesthetic is used prior to injection of methylprednisolone acetate injectable suspension, the anesthetic package insert should be read carefully and all the precautions observed.

2. Bursitis. The area around the injection site is prepared in a sterile way and a wheal at the site made with 1 percent procaine hydrochloride solution. A 20 to 24 gauge needle attached to a dry syringe is inserted into the bursa and the fluid aspirated. The needle is left in place and the aspirating syringe changed for a small syringe containing the desired dose. After injection, the needle is withdrawn and a small dressing applied.

### Implementing the 27 PRISMA 2020 statement items for systematic reviews in the sport and exercise medicine, musculoskeletal rehabilitation and sports science fields: the PERSiST (implementing prisma in exercise, rehabilitation, sport medicine and sporTs science) guidance [^112JeXTm]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Item 4: objectives

Provide an explicit statement of the objective(s) or question(s) the review addresses.

Note for systematic reviewers. Frame the objectives of systematic reviews of interventions according to the population, intervention, comparison, outcomes (PICO) framework. For a guide on framing other types of systematic reviews (eg, prognosis, diagnostic test accuracy) we recommend Munn et al.

Example: 'The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised trials was to provide a comprehensive overview of the effectiveness of all relevant non-surgical interventions for adults with shoulder impingements and outcomes on impairment (pain and active range of motion), activity limitation or participation restriction (shoulder function questionnaires) based on an a priori stated hierarchy'.
Example: 'This review intended to evaluate the effectiveness of exercise compared with other conservative interventions in the management of LET (lateral elbow tendinopathy). We also tried to synthesise the evidence regarding exercise type, mode and dosage aiming to inform clinical practice'.
Methods

Item 5: eligibility criteria

Specify the inclusion and exclusion criteria for the review and how studies were grouped for the syntheses.

Note for systematic reviewers. Structure the eligibility criteria according to the framework used to define the review objective(s) or question(s) (eg, PICO) to help readers understand the scope of the systematic review.

Example:

'Types of studies

Eligible RCTs were identified from systematic reviews investigating the effects of exercise therapy and published in the Cochrane database of Systematic Reviews. RCTs, cluster-randomised trials and randomised crossover studies were included if they compared an exercise therapy intervention with a non-exercising control treatment.

Types of participants

Studies that included participants with or without a medical condition were eligible, except for participants receiving chemotherapy, as all or nearly all these participants are anticipated to experience adverse events. Otherwise, no studies were excluded based on specific characteristics of the participants.

### CONSORT 2025 explanation and elaboration: updated guideline for reporting randomised trials [^116ef7HL]. BMJ (2025). Excellent credibility.

Example

"Patients aged 18 years or older were recruited from 20 UK National Health Service (NHS) trusts. Patients were eligible if they had a diagnosis of shoulder pain attributable to a rotator cuff disorder (eg, cuff tendonitis, impingement syndrome, tendinopathy, or rotator cuff tear) that had started within the past 6 months. We used the diagnostic criteria set out in the British Elbow and Shoulder Society (BESS) guidelines. Patients were excluded if they had a history of significant shoulder trauma (eg, dislocation, fracture, or full-thickness tear requiring surgery), neurological disease affecting the shoulder, other shoulder conditions (eg, inflammatory arthritis, frozen shoulder, or glenohumeral joint instability), received corticosteroid injection or physiotherapy for shoulder pain in the past 6 months, or were being considered for surgery. Detailed criteria are in the protocol".

### Diagnostic and therapeutic injection of the shoulder region [^111aE5vE]. American Family Physician (2003). Low credibility.

The shoulder is the site of multiple injuries and inflammatory conditions that lend themselves to diagnostic and therapeutic injection. Joint injection should be considered after other therapeutic interventions such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, physical therapy, and activity-modification have been tried. Indications for glenohumeral joint injection include osteoarthritis, adhesive capsulitis, and rheumatoid arthritis. For the acromioclavicular joint, injection may be used for diagnosis and treatment of osteoarthritis and distal clavicular osteolysis. Subacromial injections are useful for a range of conditions including adhesive capsulitis, subdeltoid bursitis, impingement syndrome, and rotator cuff tendinosis. Scapulothoracic injections are reserved for inflammation of the involved bursa. Persistent pain related to inflammatory conditions of the long head of the biceps responds well to injection in the region. The proper technique, choice and quantity of pharmaceuticals, and appropriate follow-up are essential for effective outcomes.

### Andolecranon bursitis / osteomyelitis: a case involving surgical and antibiotic treatment [^112CsSoB]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

Similar to our patient's case, the onset of infection with P. acnes is usually insidious and of low virulence, and once established it persists due to the tendency of these organisms to form a biofilm. For this reason, antibiofilm antibiotics, such as rifampicin (rifampin), are often necessary for successful treatment. However, rifampicin-resistant P. acnes have been known to appear as a result of this treatment. High dose intravenous penicillin is usually the drug of choice for treating P. acnes infections and rifampin is often used in combination with this antibiotic or others (eg, vancomycin or daptomycin). A main reason that we did not use penicillin and rifampin is that during the final phase of our patient's treatment we were primarily concerned for Gram-positive coverage and a polymicrobial infection. It is for this reason that we used piperacillin/tazobactam and vancomycin.

Improvements in isolating P. acnes can be achieved when employing the advanced methods. For example, in a prospective multicentre study of prosthetic joint infections, Bémer et al showed that P. acnes infections were most reliably detected using Schaedler broth (up to 14 days incubation time). ESR and CRP levels are also known to have poor sensitivity for the diagnosis and monitoring of the progress of the treatment for infected shoulder prosthetic arthroplasties. This is consistent with the variable ESR and CRP levels in our patient throughout the course of his illness and the failure of these markers to completely normalise by the end of his treatment.

P. acnes can remain viable on inanimate object surfaces for at least 17 days. While it might be conceivable that the organism was present on the metal rail at the time the patient struck it with his left elbow, it is more likely that this organism was present on his skin, especially given the presence of S. epidermidis in the same culture. Nevertheless, P. acnes are rarely the cause, or detected as a contaminant, in cases of infected olecranon bursitis. This is supported by our failure to find any reported cases of these associations in our literature searches.

### Andolecranon bursitis / osteomyelitis: a case involving surgical and antibiotic treatment [^112UhT6x]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

The initial culture showed no growth on anaerobic media but it was held for only 5 days, which is not sufficient for detecting P. acnes; growth of this organism usually requires 9–14 days. The patient's primary care physician prescribed a 5-day course of intramuscular injections of ceftriaxone 1.0 g daily and a 10-day course of doxycycline 100 mg orally two times per day. The rationale given for its combination was 'for broad antibacterial coverage'.

The patient was referred to our clinic to take over the management of his septic left olecranon bursitis because of the clear failure of his initial treatment regimen. At that time, he was applying small gauze dressings two times per day to cover and collect the drainage from the 1-centimetre diameter open wound over the olecranon. MR images of the left elbow suggested mild acute osteomyelitis of the olecranon. At this clinic visit, one culture of the tissue that was cut with a scalpel from the open wound of the left olecranon bursa was obtained. The methodology for the anaerobic culture included cooked meat glucose liquid broth, plating on anaerobic blood agar and anaerobic blood agar containing phenyl ethyl alcohol which selects for Gram-positive organisms. P. acnes grew only in cooked meat glucose liquid broth under anaerobic conditions with no colonies observed on solid medium. Cultures were kept for 14 days. P. acnes was identified by MALDI TOF mass spectrometry. Analysis for P. acnes phylotypes was not done although this information can be clinically important in some situations. S. epidermidis was also detected from the same culture when plated on aerobic blood agar. Antibiotic sensitivities were not done on either organism, which was an error because the laboratory failed to recognise that the sample was bursa tissue.

### Efficacy of empiric antibiotic management of septic olecranon bursitis without bursal aspiration in emergency department patients [^1154jqqf]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

Eighty‐eight percent of ED patients with suspected septic olecranon bursitis treated with empiric outpatient antibiotics without aspiration had resolution without need for subsequent bursal aspiration, hospitalization, or surgery. Eighty‐nine percent of patients admitted to the hospital for empiric antibiotic management for whom follow‐up was available did not undergo bursal aspiration in the ED or after admission and 100% of these patients had an uncomplicated resolution. Our findings suggest that empiric antibiotics without bursal aspiration is a reasonable initial approach to ED management of select patients with suspected septic olecranon bursitis who have adequate access to follow‐up care, are immunocompetent, are able to tolerate oral antibiotics, and are at low risk for antibiotic complications.

After piperacillin/tazobactam was started, the wound started to granulate well and was closed after 18 days of treatment with this antibiotic. Closure included a Z-plasty and retention stitches with bolsters which enabled closure of the retracted skin margins (figure 2). After closure, the patient's left upper extremity was placed in long-arm cylinder cast at 30° of elbow flexion. The cast was changed every 2 weeks and the elbow flexion angle was increased 30° each time. This regimen was done to allow wound healing without excessive skin tension. The wound healed uneventfully (figure 3).

Figure 2
Photograph of the patient's left elbow showing the lesion closed with retention stitches. The stitches are passed through 0.5 cm segments that were cut from a narrow rubber tube, which are bolsters that serve to distribute stress so that the stitches do not cut through the skin.

Figure 3
Photograph taken 4 months after the elbow wound was closed. The wound had healed well and without any problems at final follow-up, which was 14 months after this photograph was taken.

The patient's C reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) results are shown in figure 4. These values were never within normal limits during the course of treatment, which we attributed to inflammation associated with osteoarthritis of his elbows.

### What's changed in the management of the frozen shoulder? [^11578tTi]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2015). Low credibility.

Frozen shoulder is a painful condition in which movement of the shoulder becomes restricted. It can interfere with domestic and social activities and affect the ability to work. The condition can vary from mild to severe in terms of pain and/or restricted movement. We last reviewed the management of frozen shoulder 15 years ago. We concluded then that there was no clear evidence that any treatment could shorten the natural history of the condition and found little evidence as to the best management option. Here, we review the evidence on treatment approaches published in the meantime.

### Prevention and treatment of elbow stiffness: a 5-year update [^113cw9Z9]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Elbow stiffness is a challenging and common problem faced by upper extremity surgeons. Although functional improvements can be made with both nonsurgical and surgical management strategies, physicians must remain vigilant with efforts to prevent stiffness before it starts. Recent advancements in the biology and pathology of elbow contracture have led to improved understanding of this difficult problem, and they may lead to future breakthroughs in the prevention and treatment of elbow stiffness. This article serves as an update to our previous review of elbow stiffness, focusing on recent advancements in the past 5 years, as well as updating our current algorithm for treatment.
