## Question

Hemiplegia what is

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what hemiplegia is. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core definition and whether it is paralysis versus severe weakness. Then, I should verify the anatomic pattern and laterality. Next, I will consider the major etiologies across ages, including stroke, cerebral palsy, and alternating hemiplegia. After that, I need to examine the pathophysiology, including corticospinal involvement and spasticity. Then, I should review clinical manifestations, including motor patterns, sensory and cognitive associations, and complications like hemiplegic shoulder pain. Finally, I will synthesize a concise, clinically useful definition and note key differentials and implications for management, making sure I double-check any numerical claims against the cited sources as I go.

> Let me first confirm the core definition. Hemiplegia is paralysis of one side of the body, typically involving the face, arm, and leg on the same side, and it reflects damage to the corticospinal motor pathways from the contralateral cerebral hemisphere or brainstem, with classic descriptions emphasizing pure motor hemiplegia without sensory, visual field, or language deficits in some cases [^820310a2].

> Wait, let me verify the anatomic pattern and laterality. The motor deficit is contralateral to the lesion because the corticospinal tracts decussate in the medulla; thus, a left hemisphere lesion causes right hemiplegia and vice versa, and the distribution commonly includes the lower face and ipsilateral upper and lower extremities, consistent with the somatotopic organization of the motor homunculus [^820310a2].

> I need to check the major etiologies across ages. In adults, acute hemiplegia most often results from ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke, where thrombolysis may still be appropriate despite severe deficits and should not be withheld solely due to hemiplegia at presentation, though prognosis varies with age and early imaging findings [^5d9217d9]. In children, congenital hemiplegia frequently arises from perinatal arterial ischemic stroke, producing hemiplegic cerebral palsy, while acquired childhood hemiplegia can follow arterial ischemic stroke or other focal brain injuries, and alternating hemiplegia of childhood represents a rare, genetically mediated paroxysmal disorder with recurrent hemiplegic episodes and autonomic features [^8d4c31b4] [^83e6262f] [^2e6c4da3].

> Hold on, I should verify the pathophysiology. The proximate cause is disruption of the corticospinal tract at some point from the motor cortex through the internal capsule, corona radiata, basis pontis, or corticospinal fibers in the brainstem, with small vessel lacunar infarcts classically producing pure motor hemiplegia when they involve the internal capsule or basis pontis [^820310a2]. Clinically, upper motor neuron injury leads to spasticity, increased tone, and characteristic synergistic movement patterns, though definitions and measurement of spasticity vary across studies and can complicate interpretation of trials and clinical assessments [^601cd4bc].

> Let me consider the clinical manifestations carefully. Initially, the affected limbs may be flaccid, but over days to weeks spasticity emerges with a flexor synergy pattern in the upper extremity and extensor synergy in the lower extremity, producing the classic hemiparetic gait with circumduction and equinovarus foot posture. Hemiplegic shoulder pain is common in stroke survivors and can impede rehabilitation, reflecting multifactorial mechanisms including subluxation, soft tissue injury, and central pain phenomena [^d0d7e391] [^84b35d9a] [^ea10cfd8]. I should double-check the prevalence figures: reports commonly cite 22–23% in community cohorts and 54–55% in rehabilitation settings, which aligns with the literature, though estimates vary by ascertainment and timing [^84b35d9a].

> But wait, what about associated deficits beyond pure motor loss. Depending on lesion location and size, hemiplegia may coexist with hemisensory loss, hemianopia, aphasia with left hemisphere lesions, or neglect and anosognosia with right hemisphere lesions; anosognosia for hemiplegia is most frequent in the hyperacute phase and tends to improve over time, with lesion correlates including insula and right parietofrontal networks, and its incidence is lower when conservative diagnostic criteria are applied [^61dffbaa] [^9a40871a] [^9d6cfaec]. I should confirm that these associations are more typical of larger cortical or subcortical lesions rather than small lacunar infarcts, which aligns with classic neuroanatomy and stroke syndromes [^820310a2] [^08a21efc].

> Next, I should review complications and functional impact. Hemiplegic shoulder pain can limit participation and worsen outcomes, necessitating early prevention and targeted management including positioning, range-of-motion strategies, and selective interventions. Spasticity and contractures can develop without early rehabilitation, and respiratory muscle weakness may accompany severe hemiplegia, affecting balance and activities of daily living, which argues for integrating trunk and respiratory training into rehabilitation planning [^84b35d9a] [^e4e3bfc2]. Let me reconsider whether to quantify functional prognosis; while many stroke survivors regain walking, upper limb recovery is often incomplete, and this asymmetry shapes rehabilitation priorities and expectations [^notfound].

> I will now examine special entities to avoid overgeneralization. Alternating hemiplegia of childhood presents with recurrent, often prolonged hemiplegic episodes that may switch sides, associated with dystonia, oculomotor abnormalities, seizures, and autonomic dysfunction; most cases are due to ATP1A3 mutations, and cardiac conduction abnormalities are common, warranting ECG screening and caution with drugs that affect repolarization [^2e6c4da3] [^161584a0]. Hemiconvulsion-hemiplegia-epilepsy syndrome follows prolonged unilateral convulsive status epilepticus in infancy, with acute hemispheric edema and chronic hemiatrophy, and a risk of intractable epilepsy; early recognition and seizure control are critical to prognosis [^9501492c] [^0a9af252].

> Let me synthesize a clinically useful definition. Hemiplegia is complete or severe loss of voluntary motor control on one side of the body, typically involving the face, arm, and leg, due to contralateral corticospinal pathway injury. It is most often caused by stroke in adults and by perinatal arterial ischemic stroke in children, with other causes including hemorrhage, tumors, trauma, and genetic or inflammatory conditions. The clinical course evolves from flaccidity to spasticity with synergistic movement patterns, and common complications include hemiplegic shoulder pain, contractures, and respiratory muscle involvement, all of which require early, multidisciplinary rehabilitation and etiology-specific management [^820310a2] [^8d4c31b4] [^84b35d9a] [^e4e3bfc2].

> Hold on, I should verify key differentials and implications. Hemiparesis denotes partial weakness rather than complete paralysis and shares the same lateralizing logic. Todd paralysis after seizures is transient. Migraine with hemiplegic aura produces transient hemiplegia with headache and aura. And functional or psychogenic hemiplegia lacks organic motor pathway injury on appropriate evaluation, so distinguishing these entities guides urgency, workup, and treatment decisions, particularly in acute presentations where stroke must be rapidly excluded or confirmed [^8aee3d62] [^7ae7a11b].

---

Hemiplegia is **paralysis of one side** of the body, most often due to stroke or other brain injury affecting the corticospinal tract [^820310a2]. It presents with **sudden weakness or loss of movement** on one side, often with spasticity, altered tone, and impaired coordination [^d0d7e391]. Diagnosis relies on clinical assessment and neuroimaging (MRI or CT) to identify the cause and guide acute management, including thrombolysis for ischemic stroke when indicated [^5d9217d9]. Rehabilitation is essential to restore function, manage complications such as hemiplegic shoulder pain [^84b35d9a], and improve independence [^2f2aa9ad]. Prognosis varies with cause, severity, and timing of intervention, with many patients achieving partial recovery and some full recovery with intensive therapy [^5d9217d9].

---

## Clinical features

Hemiplegia is characterized by the following **clinical features**:

- **Motor impairment**: Paralysis or severe weakness of the face, arm, and leg on one side of the body [^820310a2].

- **Spasticity**: Increased muscle tone, hyperreflexia, and clonus are common due to upper motor neuron involvement [^notfound].

- **Coordination and balance**: Difficulty with coordination, balance, and fine motor skills on the affected side [^d16be299].

- **Sensory involvement**: Sensory loss or altered sensation may accompany motor deficits, depending on the underlying cause [^notfound].

- **Speech and language**: Left hemispheric lesions may cause aphasia, while right hemispheric lesions may cause neglect or spatial awareness deficits [^d550935b].

---

## Common causes

Hemiplegia can result from **various underlying conditions**, including:

| **Category** | **Common causes** |
|-|-|
| Vascular | - Ischemic stroke [^820310a2] <br/> - Hemorrhagic stroke [^notfound] <br/> - Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis [^notfound] |
| Traumatic | - Traumatic brain injury [^08a21efc] <br/> - Subdural hematoma [^6bed168b] |
| Infectious | - Encephalitis [^notfound] <br/> - Meningitis [^notfound] <br/> - Brain abscess [^notfound] |
| Neoplastic | - Brain tumors [^6bed168b] <br/> - Metastatic lesions [^notfound] |
| Congenital/developmental | - Cerebral palsy [^aba8618c] <br/> - Perinatal stroke [^8d4c31b4] <br/> - Alternating hemiplegia of childhood [^2e6c4da3] |
| Other | - Multiple sclerosis [^notfound] <br/> - Conversion disorder [^notfound] |

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

Diagnosis of hemiplegia involves a **combination of clinical assessment and diagnostic tests**:

- **Clinical assessment**: Detailed neurological examination to assess motor strength, tone, reflexes, coordination, and sensory function [^notfound].

- **Neuroimaging**: MRI is the gold standard for identifying acute ischemic stroke, hemorrhage, tumors, or other structural lesions. CT scan is useful for rapid detection of hemorrhage [^notfound].

- **Laboratory tests**: Blood tests to identify underlying metabolic, infectious, or inflammatory causes [^notfound].

- **Electrophysiological studies**: EEG may be used to evaluate seizure activity in cases of alternating hemiplegia or epilepsy-related hemiplegia [^notfound].

---

## Management strategies

Management of hemiplegia requires a **multidisciplinary approach** that includes:

- **Acute management**: Thrombolysis for ischemic stroke, surgical intervention for hemorrhage or mass lesions, and anticoagulation for venous thrombosis [^5d9217d9].

- **Rehabilitation**: Physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech therapy are essential for functional recovery, improving mobility, strength, and independence [^2f2aa9ad].

- **Pharmacological management**: Antispastic agents (e.g. baclofen, botulinum toxin) for spasticity, antiepileptic drugs for seizures, and analgesics for pain management [^0fd5020a].

- **Supportive care**: Psychological support, caregiver education, and social services to address emotional and social impacts [^c9786a3b].

---

## Prognosis and recovery

Prognosis of hemiplegia **varies widely** depending on the underlying cause, severity, and timeliness of intervention. Stroke patients may show significant recovery within weeks to months, with ongoing rehabilitation yielding continued gains [^5d9217d9]. In children with hemiplegic cerebral palsy, early intervention and intensive therapy can lead to substantial functional improvement [^a6af87ea]. Persistent deficits may remain, particularly in severe cases or when rehabilitation is delayed [^0f564940].

---

## Complications

Hemiplegia can lead to several **complications**, including:

- **Hemiplegic shoulder pain**: Common due to subluxation, spasticity, or soft tissue injury [^84b35d9a].

- **Contractures**: Permanent shortening of muscles and tendons due to prolonged immobility or spasticity [^0f564940].

- **Pressure ulcers**: Resulting from immobility and poor positioning [^notfound].

- **Depression and anxiety**: Due to functional limitations and lifestyle changes [^notfound].

---

Hemiplegia is **paralysis of one side** of the body, most often from stroke or brain injury, with sudden weakness, spasticity, and coordination loss. Diagnosis relies on clinical assessment and neuroimaging, and management includes acute treatment, rehabilitation, and supportive care. Prognosis varies with cause and severity, but many patients improve with therapy, though complications like shoulder pain and contractures can occur [^820310a2].

### The treatment and management of alternating hemiplegia of childhood [^40bf1fe6]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2007). Low credibility.

Alternating hemiplegia of childhood has many factors that make it difficult to manage. These include its rarity of about one case per million, the variability of the manifestations, with seven characteristic features, and the potential for disabilities and acute, often severe, episodes in a disease that is of uncertain cause and for which treatment evidence is sparse. An integrated multidisciplinary team and emergency availability are key medical requirements, as well as an educational setting that understands the variations in performance that occur. The mainstays of treatment have been flunarizine, antiepilepsy drugs for the 50% of patients with epilepsy, attempts to avoid trigger situations, and the rapid encouragement of sleep when attacks begin. The diagnostic and management predicament of child, parent, and paediatrician in complex rare disorders are well illustrated by this condition.

### Managing painful shoulder after neurological injury [^cc0819ee]. Practical Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Shoulder pain is a common symptom following neurological injury, particularly in the presence of hemiparesis. It can be disabling, lead to poor functional outcomes, and increase care costs. Its aetiology is multifactorial, and several pathologies typically contribute to a clinical presentation. Astute diagnostic skills and a multi-disciplinary approach are required to recognise accurately those which are clinically relevant, and to implement appropriate stepwise management.

In the absence of large clinical trial data, we aim to provide a comprehensive, practical and pragmatic overview of shoulder pain in patients with neurological conditions. We use available evidence as the basis of producing a management guideline, and take into account interdisciplinary opinions of Neurology, Rehabilitation Medicine, Orthopaedics and Physiotherapy.

### Hemiplegic shoulder pain: an approach to diagnosis and management [^bea53f46]. Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Stroke is a significant source of mortality and long-term disability in the United States. Of persons who survive a stroke, approximately 50% will have hemiplegia, half of whom will live with a nonfunctional arm. Hemiplegic shoulder pain (HSP), which occurs in most patients with hemiplegia, reduces participation and worsens outcomes in rehabilitation. Management of HSP is challenging because its causes are multifactorial and there is limited, conflicting, or nonspecific evidence in support of most treatments. This article develops an effective approach for diagnosis and treatment using the best available evidence to aid practitioners in obtaining optimal results.

### Comorbidities in amputation: a systematic review of hemiplegia and lower limb amputation [^ba0f7782]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose

The purpose of this review of the scientific literature was to investigate the incidence and prevalence of hemiplegia with lower limb amputation, and to identify outcomes following the dual disability of hemiplegia and amputation.

Methods

Electronic searching of the literature identified major studies examining the effects of hemiplegia on rehabilitation following amputation. Data were extracted and levels of evidence assigned for each subtopic area.

Results

The summary conclusions are Level 4 evidence. The prevalence of amputation and hemiplegia is 8–18% and amputation and hemiplegia occur most often in the same leg. Once individuals with hemiplegia and lower limb amputation are selected for prosthetic rehabilitation, rate of successful functional ambulation is greater than 58%. In general there is a lower rate of prosthetic success and independence with hemiplegia than without. Predictive factors associated with success include less severe hemiplegia, laterality of hemiplegia (ipsilateral and right side), transtibial level of amputation and absence of impaired mental function. There is wide variation in length of hospital stay, but a specialty multidisciplinary team reduces length of stay.

Conclusions

Patients with dual disability of hemiplegia and amputation generally benefit from a prosthetic rehabilitation program. Further study on predictive factors for outcome would be beneficial.

Implications For Rehabilitation

- The prevalence of hemiplegia with lower limb amputation ranges from 8 to 18%, most frequently affecting the same leg.
- The majority of patients attain successful functional levels of ambulation with prosthetic rehabilitation, although lower rates than nonhemiplegic patients.
- Predictive factors associated with greater success include less severe hemiplegia, ipsilateral hemiplegia, transtibial level of amputation and absence of impaired mental function.

### A practical approach to acute hemiparesis in children [^25dc995c]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

Acute hemiparesis in children is a common clinical syndrome presenting to a variety of care settings. The recognition and the differential diagnosis is challenging, particularly in young children. Arterial ischaemic stroke (AIS) is the primary diagnosis to be considered as this requires emergency investigations and management; however, there are several conditions collectively described as 'stroke mimics' that need consideration. Accurate diagnosis is essential for appropriate management. Clinical data combined with neuroimaging are important for accurate diagnosis and management. This review and the accompanying illustrative case vignettes suggest a practical approach to differential diagnosis and management of children presenting with acute hemiparesis.

### Comparing functional profiles of children with hemiplegic and diplegic cerebral palsy in GMFCS levels I and II: are separate classifications needed? [^602207e0]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2006). Low credibility.

The goal was to compare children with hemiplegia with those with diplegia within Gross Motor Functional Classification System (GMFCS) levels using multiple validated outcome tools. Specifically, we proposed that children with hemiplegia would have better gait and gross motor function within levels while upper extremity function would be poorer. Data were collected on 422 ambulatory children with cerebral palsy: 261 with diplegia and 161 with hemiplegia, across seven centers. Those with hemiplegia in each level performed significantly and consistently better on gait or lower extremity function and poorer on upper extremity and school function than those with diplegia. In GMFCS Level II, the group with hemiplegia walked faster (p = 0.017), scored 6.6 points higher on Dimension E of the Gross Motor Function Measure (p = 0.017), 6.7 points lower on Upper Extremity subscale of the Pediatric Outcomes Data Collection Instrument, and 9.1 points lower on WeeFIM self-care (p = 0.002). Basing motor prognosis on GMFCS level alone may underestimate lower extremity skills of children with hemiplegia, and overestimate those of children with diplegia.

### Predictors of prognosis for elderly patients with poststroke hemiplegia experiencing hip fractures [^d5513bee]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2009). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Hip fracture is an important cause of mortality and disability in elderly patients, particularly in those with poststroke hemiplegia, but little information is available regarding differences of general characteristics between patients with and without hemiplegia who experience hip fractures, factors predicting recovery of prefracture ambulatory status, and mortality of patients with poststroke hemiplegia with hip fractures. We retrospectively reviewed 1379 consecutive prospectively followed patients with hip fractures treated from January 2000 to May 2006. Of the 1379 patients, 101 (7.3%) had poststroke hemiplegia. All patients were followed a minimum of 1 year if they survived more than a year or until death if they died within a year after surgery (mean, 19.5 months; range, 4–49 months). According to the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) rating, the patients with hemiplegia were sicker than patients without hemiplegia, more likely to have three or more comorbidities, lower cognitive ability, weaker prefracture ambulatory status, more days of hospitalization, and higher mortality rate. Gender, ASA rating, number of comorbidities, and prefracture ambulatory status predicted mortality of hip fractures in elderly patients with poststroke hemiplegia, and the ASA rating, number of comorbidities, and cognitive ability predicted recovery of prefracture ambulatory status for these patients.

### Hemiplegia and thrombolysis [^5d9217d9]. European Journal of Neurology (2012). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Hemiplegia at stroke onset may be considered a contraindication for thrombolytic therapy. We describe the outcome of patients with ischaemic stroke presenting with hemiplegia and treated with intravenous alteplase (tPA).

Methods

All patients treated with tPA for acute ischaemic stroke between 1995 and 2010 were prospectively recorded in the Helsinki Stroke Thrombolysis Registry. Patients with basilar artery occlusion (BAO) were excluded. Hemiplegia was defined as no visible voluntary movement on ipsilateral arm and leg.

Results

Of all treated patients (n = 1579), we excluded those with BAO (n = 152). Of remaining 1427 patients, 81 (6%) had hemiplegia at baseline. By 24 h, three had died and 20 retained their total hemiplegia. At day 7, a further nine had died, and 10 had persistent hemiplegia. A good 3-month outcome, modified Rankin Scale (mRS, 0–2), was observed in 23%, independence in ambulatory function (mRS 3) in further 16%, while 9% were bedridden and 20% dead. A wide clinical spectrum of neurological deficits coexisted with hemiplegia. With advanced age, more neurological functions lost, and with early radiological signs, the prognosis of patients with hemiplegia deteriorated. With combined fixed eye deviation (n = 23), half were either bedridden (n = 3) or dead (n = 9) by 3 months, and fatal intracerebral haemorrhage were common (n = 5).

Conclusions

Hemiplegia at presentation should not prevent thrombolytic therapy by itself, as limb movements are likely to return, and two of five thrombolysis-treated patients will walk independently by 3 months. With combined fixed eye deviation, the outcome is poorer and haemorrhagic complications are common.

### Prevalence of rare diseases: bibliographic data [^6ec984fa]. Orphanet Report Series (2024). Medium credibility.

### Anosognosia for hemiplegia after stroke is a multifaceted phenomenon: a systematic review of the literature [^61dffbaa]. Brain (2007). Low credibility.

Anosognosia is the lack of awareness or the underestimation of a specific deficit in sensory, perceptual, motor, affective or cognitive functioning due to a brain lesion. This self-awareness deficit has been studied mainly in stroke hemiplegic patients, who may report no deficit, overestimate their abilities or deny that they are unable to move a paretic limb. In this review, a detailed search of the literature was conducted to illustrate clinical manifestations, pathogenetic models, diagnostic procedures and unresolved issues in anosognosia for motor impairment after stroke. English and French language papers spanning the period January 1990-January 2007 were selected using PubMed Services and utilizing research words stroke, anosognosia, awareness, denial, unawareness, hemiplegia. Papers reporting sign-based definitions, neurological and neuropsychological data and the results of clinical trials or historical trends in diagnosis were chosen. As a result, a very complex and multifaceted phenomenon emerges, whose variable behavioural manifestations often produce uncertainties in conceptual definitions and diagnostic procedures. Although a number of questionnaires and diagnostic methods have been developed to assess anosognosia following stroke in the last 30 years, they are often limited by insufficient discriminative power or a narrow focus on specific deficits. As a consequence, epidemiological estimates are variable and incidence rates have ranged from 7 to 77% in stroke. In addition, the pathogenesis of anosognosia is widely debated. The most recent neuropsychological models have suggested a defect in the feedforward system, while neuro-anatomical studies have consistently reported on the involvement of the right cerebral hemisphere, particularly the prefrontal and parieto-temporal cortex, as well as insula and thalamus. We highlight the need for a multidimensional assessment procedure and suggest some potentially productive directions for future research about unawareness of illness.

### Child neurology: hemiconvulsion-hemiplegia-epilepsy syndrome [^9501492c]. Neurology (2012). Low credibility.

Hemiconvulsion-hemiplegia-epilepsy (HHE) syndrome is an uncommon outcome of prolonged focal status epilepticus in childhood. The prolonged focal motor seizure usually occurs during the course of a febrile illness and is followed by hemiplegia ipsilateral to the side of convulsions. This is accompanied by radiologic evidence of acute cytotoxic edema in the affected hemisphere followed by chronic atrophy. Intractable epilepsy may develop at a time remote from the initial presentation. The clinical features of HHE syndrome were first described more than 5 decades ago but its pathophysiology remains poorly understood and the long-term cognitive outcomes are unclear. Early recognition of the syndrome may help provide patients and families with an accurate prognosis regarding the subsequent development of epilepsy.

### Underlying pathology and associated factors of hemiplegic shoulder pain [^84b35d9a]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2011). Low credibility.

The prevalence of hemiplegic shoulder pain is approximately 22%-23% in the general population of stroke survivors and approximately 54%-55% among stroke patients in rehabilitation settings. Hemiplegic shoulder pain causes a reduced quality-of-life, poor functional recovery, depression, disturbed sleep, and prolonged hospitalization. Herein, we attempted to understand, based on a literature review and experts' opinion, the pathologic processes underlying hemiplegic shoulder pain and the major associated factors contributing to its development. The systematization of underlying pathologies was proposed, which might eventually enable a more constructive clinical approach in evaluating and treating patients with hemiplegic shoulder pain.

### Effects of motor imagery training for lower limb dysfunction in patients with stroke: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^e86d2c77]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2023). Medium credibility.

What Is Known

Motor imagery training can improve lower limb motor function in poststroke patients. However, controversy regarding its efficacy on hemiplegic lower limb function remains.

What Is New

Motor imagery training combined with conventional rehabilitation therapies (CRTs) has more benefits than CRTs alone in stroke patients with lower limb motor dysfunction. This combined therapy can make a more positive impact on Fugl-Meyer Lower Extremity Assessment and the modified or original Barthel index in acute phase stroke (1–7 days), walking ability, stride length, and cadence in subacute stage (7 days to 6 mos), as well as walking speed in chronic stage patients (more than 6 mos after stroke).

The lower limbs of approximately 88% of stroke patients exhibit residual dysfunction. Motor dysfunction caused by hemiparesis and fear associated with falling after stroke prevents survivors from practicing walking by themselves, contributing to a further decline in their walking capacity and perhaps overall physical deterioration. Innumerable conventional rehabilitation therapies (CRTs) are used to remodel motor function (MF) in poststroke patients who have lower limb dyskinesia by repeatedly stimulating or performing movements, – improving the biomechanical performance of paralyzed limbs, enhancing neuroplasticity, and supporting the production of normal movement sequences. Nevertheless, limited by patients' muscle strength, fear of falling, training environment, and professional supervision, some CRTs cannot be immediately included in stroke patients' rehabilitation practice. As a complement to CRTs, various emerging therapies or technologies (such as virtual reality technology, noninvasive brain stimulation, brain-computer interfaces, and motor imagery training [MIT])are based on neuroplasticity, and their potential for MF improvements has been explored. Among these therapies, MIT is a process of repetitive cognitive rehearsal, during which patients imagine performing movements from the first- or third-person perspective without actual physical movements. Motor imagery training is a low-cost and easy-to-apply technique that is unrestricted by the severity of hemiplegia or training grounds. These positive benefits of MIT have attracted the attention of many stroke physiotherapists and rehabilitation practitioners.

### Pure motor hemiplegia… [^820310a2]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Delineation of the stroke-syndrome, pure motor hemiplegia, aids in the bedside differentiation and therapy of cerebrovascular disease. The term applies to complete or incomplete paralysis of the face, arm, and leg on one side, unaccompanied by sensory signs, visual field defect, or dysphasia. The July issue of the Archives of Neurology1 presents an investigation of 50 cases observed clinically. In eight of the cases examined pathologically, the responsible lesion was a lacune or small infarct deep in the brain, situated somewhere along the motor pathways — internal capsule, basis pontis, or corona radiata. The infarct is presumably the result of occlusion of a small penetrating artery of a size not visualized by arteriography. Thrombosis rather than embolism is almost always the vascular process. Only four of the patients in this investigation were not hypertensive.

The investigators conclude that neither hypertensive hemorrhage into the brain nor occlusion of the larger arteries: 300–301. doi: 10.1001/jama.1965.03090040044013 ©

### Anosognosia for hemiplegia: a clinical-anatomical prospective study [^9a40871a]. Brain (2010). Low credibility.

Anosognosia for hemiplegia is a common and striking disorder following stroke. Because it is typically transient and variable, it remains poorly understood and has rarely been investigated at different times in a systematic manner. Our study evaluated a prospective cohort of 58 patients with right-hemisphere stroke and significant motor deficit of the left hemibody, who were examined using a comprehensive neuropsychological battery at 3 days (hyperacute), 1 week (subacute) and 6 months (chronic) after stroke onset. Anosognosia for hemiplegia was frequent in the hyperacute phase (32%), but reduced by almost half 1 week later (18%) and only rarely seen at 6 months (5%). Anosognosia for hemiplegia was correlated with the severity of several other deficits, most notably losses in proprioception, extrapersonal spatial neglect and disorientation. While multiple regression analyses highlighted proprioceptive loss as the most determinant factor for the hyperacute period, and visuospatial neglect and disorientation as more determinant for the subacute phase, patients with both proprioceptive loss and neglect had significantly higher incidence of anosognosia for hemiplegia than those with only one deficit or no deficits (although a few double dissociations were observed). Personal neglect and frontal lobe tests showed no significant relation with anosognosia for hemiplegia, nor did psychological traits such as optimism and mood. Moreover, anosognosia for neglect and prediction of performance in non-motor tasks were unrelated to anosognosia for hemiplegia, suggesting distinct monitoring mechanisms for each of these domains. Finally, by using a voxel-based statistical mapping method to identify lesions associated with a greater severity of anosognosia, we found that damage to the insula (particularly its anterior part) and adjacent subcortical structures was determinant for anosognosia for hemiplegia in the hyperacute period, while additional lesions in the premotor cortex, cingulate gyrus, parietotemporal junction and medial temporal structures (hippocampus and amygdala) were associated with the persistence of anosognosia for hemiplegia in the subacute phase. Taken together, these results suggest that anosognosia for hemiplegia is likely to reflect a multi-component disorder due to lesions affecting a distributed set of brain regions, which can lead to several co-existing deficits in sensation, attention, interoceptive bodily representations, motor programming, error monitoring, memory and even affective processing, possibly with different combinations in different patients.

### Benign nocturnal alternating hemiplegia of childhood: six patients and long-term follow-up [^e362281a]. Neurology (2001). Low credibility.

Benign familial nocturnal alternating hemiplegia of childhood refers to recurrent attacks of hemiplegia arising from sleep, described in young children without neurologic or mental impairment. It is probably migraine related. The authors report two unrelated patients with nocturnal attacks starting at 22 and 31 months, followed by daytime episodes in one. The authors confirm the benign course of this disorder. It is distinct from the classic malignant form of alternating hemiplegia of childhood.

### Hemiconvulsion-hemiplegia-epilepsy syndrome: clinical course and neuroradiological features in a 20-month-old girl [^0a9af252]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

Hemiconvulsion-hemiplegia-epilepsy (HHE) syndrome involves initial sudden and prolonged unilateral convulsive seizures, followed by transient or permanent hemiplegia and epilepsy during infancy or early childhood. Seizures are prolonged, difficult to control and sometimes may require surgery. Hemiplegia varies in intensity, differs from Todd paralysis and disappears in about 20% of cases. Neuroimaging characteristically shows brain atrophy more pronounced on the hemisphere contralateral to the side of hemiplegia with dilation of the ventricular system. A 20-month-old girl presented with left hemiconvulsions and left hemiplegia lasting for a prolonged period. Seizures failed to resolve with various anticonvulsants even after many physician contacts. Characteristic neuroimaging findings, seizure control with carbamazepine and valproate, subsequent recovery of hemiplegia and attainment of developmental milestones observed on follow-up confirmed HHE syndrome. The case highlights the need for good seizure control in this syndrome.

### Hemiplegic shoulder pain: a common clinical consequence of stroke [^ea10cfd8]. Practical Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

Hemiplegic shoulder pain is common in stroke survivors, developing in up to 54% of patients. The underlying mechanisms include soft tissue lesions, impaired motor function and central nervous system-related phenomena. Hemiplegic shoulder pain has many underlying causes and is challenging to manage, requiring a team approach, including physicians, therapists and caregivers. The management strategy must target the underlying causes. Preventative measures, such as positioning and handling, can reduce the risk of developing hemiplegic shoulder pain. We have reviewed the literature on hemiplegic shoulder pain, and used this to categorise the underlying mechanisms, and to explore the best management strategies.

### The impact of physical therapy on functional outcomes after stroke: what's the evidence? [^2f2aa9ad]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the evidence for physical therapy interventions aimed at improving functional outcome after stroke.

Methods

MEDLINE, CINAHL, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, DARE, PEDro, EMBASE and DocOnline were searched for controlled studies. Physical therapy was divided into 10 intervention categories, which were analysed separately. If statistical pooling (weighted summary effect sizes) was not possible due to lack of comparability between interventions, patient characteristics and measures of outcome, a best-research synthesis was performed. This best-research synthesis was based on methodological quality (PEDro score).

Results

In total, 151 studies were included in this systematic review; 123 were randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and 28 controlled clinical trials (CCTs). Methodological quality of all RCTs had a median of 5 points on the 10-point PEDro scale (range 2–8 points). Based on high-quality RCTs strong evidence was found in favour of task-oriented exercise training to restore balance and gait, and for strengthening the lower paretic limb. Summary effect sizes (SES) for functional outcomes ranged from 0.13 (95% Cl 0.03–0.23) for effects of high intensity of exercise training to 0.92 (95% Cl 0.54–1.29) for improving symmetry when moving from sitting to standing. Strong evidence was also found for therapies that were focused on functional training of the upper limb such as constraint-induced movement therapy (SES 0.46; 95% Cl 0.07–0.91), treadmill training with or without body weight support, respectively 0.70 (95% Cl 0.29–1.10) and 1.09 (95% Cl 0.56–1.61), aerobics (SES 0.39; 95% Cl 0.05–0.74), external auditory rhythms during gait (SES 0.91; 95% Cl 0.40–1.42) and neuromuscular stimulation for glenohumeral subluxation (SES 1.41; 95% Cl 0.76–2.06). No or insufficient evidence in terms of functional outcome was found for: traditional neurological treatment approaches; exercises for the upper limb; biofeedback; functional and neuromuscular electrical stimulation aimed at improving dexterity or gait performance; orthotics and assistive devices; and physical therapy interventions for reducing hemiplegic shoulder pain and hand oedema.

Conclusions

This review showed small to large effect sizes for task-oriented exercise training, in particular when applied intensively and early after stroke onset. In almost all high-quality RCTs, effects were mainly restricted to tasks directly trained in the exercise programme.

### Perinatal ischemic stroke [^8d4c31b4]. Stroke (2007). Low credibility.

Perinatal ischemic stroke is not rare in term and near-term infants and is an important antecedent of long-term neurological disability, including congenital hemiplegia (hemiplegic cerebral palsy) and seizure and cognitive disorders. Changes in maternal hemostasis occur in pregnancy and are amplified in the period immediately surrounding birth; stroke and other thromboembolic events are more frequent in both mother and infant in this period. The vasculature and hemostatic mechanisms of placenta as well as brain are likely to be important in the pathobiology of perinatal stroke. Maternal and infant thrombophilias, genetic and acquired, play a role. Rarely is > 1 child in a sibship affected, and environmental factors-substantially less studied, to date — are likely to be key determinants of risk.

### Hemiparetic gait [^d0d7e391]. Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

The most common pattern of walking impairment poststroke is hemiparetic gait, which is characterized by asymmetry associated with an extensor synergy pattern of hip extension and adduction, knee extension, and ankle plantar flexion and inversion. There are characteristic changes in the spatiotemporal, kinematic and kinetic parameters, and dynamic electromyography patterns in hemiparesis, which may be assessed most accurately in a motion studies laboratory. An understanding of normal human gait is necessary to assess the complex interplay of motor, sensory, and proprioceptive loss; spasticity; and/or ataxia on hemiparetic gait.

### Child neurology: migraine with aura in children [^8aee3d62]. Neurology (2010). Low credibility.

The differential diagnosis for an acute hemiparesis in a child includes stroke, Todd paralysis, and hemiplegic migraine. In the context of an illustrative case, this review highlights the differences in clinical presentation among these entities and an approach to the diagnostic workup. Migraine with aura in children is reviewed, including migraine equivalents such as abdominal migraine and the particular presentation of hemiplegic migraine. An approach to the prophylactic and acute treatment for children with migraine with aura is offered.

### Relationship between motor dysfunction, the respiratory muscles and pulmonary function in stroke patients with hemiplegia: a retrospective study [^e4e3bfc2]. BMC Geriatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

This research found that patients with hemiplegia exhibited suboptimal respiratory muscle strength and pulmonary function in the presence of more severe motor dysfunction. Impaired inspiratory muscle strength was found to be associated with a reduced balance ability and limitations in activities necessary for daily living, while trunk control remained unaffected. The functions of the inspiratory muscles, particularly the diaphragm, were crucial for both respiratory and motor functions. Routine rehabilitation enhanced exercise capacity and improved the activity of the expiratory muscles more than the inspiratory muscles. Therefore, in clinical settings, enhancing motor function may improve respiratory function. However, it is imperative for therapists to prioritize the activation of diaphragm function in critically ill patients.

### Spasticity, an impairment that is poorly defined and poorly measured [^601cd4bc]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

To explore, following a literature review, whether there is a consistent definition and a unified assessment framework for the term 'spasticity'. The congruence between the definitions of spasticity and the corresponding methods of measurement were also explored.

Data Sources

The search was performed on the electronic databases Web of Science, Science Direct and MEDLINE.

Review Methods

A systematic literature search of publications written in English between the years 1980 and 2006 was performed with the following keywords: spasticity and tone. The search was limited to the following keywords: stroke, hemiplegia, upper, hand and arm.

Results

Two hundred and fifty references contributed to this review (190 clinical trials, 46 literature reviews, and 14 case reports). Seventy-eight used the Lance definition; 88 equated spasticity with increased muscle tone; 78 provided no definition; and six others used their own definitions for spasticity. Most papers used a single measure and some used more than one. Forty-seven papers used neurophysiological methods of testing, 228 used biomechanical methods of measurement or assessment, 25 used miscellaneous clinical measures (e.g. spasm frequency scales) and 19 did not explicitly describe a measure.

Conclusion

The term spasticity is inconsistently defined and this inconsistency will need to be resolved. Often, the measures used did not correspond to the clinical features of spasticity that were defined within a paper (i.e. internal validity was compromised). There is need to ensure that this lack of congruence is addressed in future research.

### Neuromuscular electrical stimulation for motor restoration in hemiplegia [^8513ddcb]. Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

This article reviews the most common therapeutic and neuroprosthetic applications of neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) for upper and lower extremity stroke rehabilitation. Fundamental NMES principles and purposes in stroke rehabilitation are explained. NMES modalities used for upper and lower limb rehabilitation are described, and efficacy studies are summarized. The evidence for peripheral and central mechanisms of action is also summarized.

### Fatal outcome in hemiconvulsion-hemiplegia syndrome [^6b437d80]. Journal of Child Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

Hemiplegia-hemiconvulsion-epilepsy syndrome is characterized by prolonged unilateral clonic seizures in a child followed by the development of hemiplegia. Focal status epilepticus results in unilateral cerebral edema of the epileptic hemisphere in the acute phase followed by cerebral hemiatrophy. Literature in the last 5 years does not describe malignant cerebral edema or resultant death. We report a case of a 3-year-old girl with hemiplegia-hemiconvulsion-epilepsy syndrome who died due to malignant cerebral edema and temporal lobe herniation. The first indication of worsening of clinical status after being seizure free was voltage suppression on continuous electroencephalography (EEG). We describe neuroimaging, EEG findings, and neuropathologic findings at autopsy and review pertinent literature. We also evaluate the evolving role of continuous EEG monitoring in the pediatric intensive care unit.

### Relationship between motor dysfunction, the respiratory muscles and pulmonary function in stroke patients with hemiplegia: a retrospective study [^f9fba0e1]. BMC Geriatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Respiratory and motor function training are both important treatments for post-stroke rehabilitation. However, the relationships between trunk capacity, balance, and activities of daily living to the inspiratory, and expiratory muscles, as well as lung volume at different levels of impairment after stroke, remain unclear. Expiratory muscle rehabilitation for stroke patients has not received much attention that it deserves until relatively recently. Indeed, the profession of respiratory therapists was not established in China until 2019, and still at present problems remain, such as insufficient attention to respiratory training and inconsistent operating standards. It is imperative to investigate the impact of routine rehabilitation training on the respiratory function of patients with hemiplegia, as it may contribute to the optimization of post-stroke rehabilitation programs. Therefore, a retrospective study was conducted to explore these aspects in patients with post-stroke hemiplegia. The findings of this study may have significant implications for enhancing the motor performance and respiratory capacity of post-stroke patients.

### Incidence and diagnosis of anosognosia for hemiparesis revisited [^9d6cfaec]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2005). Low credibility.

Background

In previous studies, the incidence of anosognosia for hemiparesis has varied between 17% and 58% in samples of brain damaged patients with hemiparesis.

Objective

To determine whether this wide variation might be explained by the different criteria used for diagnosing anosognosia.

Methods

128 acute stroke patients with hemiparesis or hemiplegia were tested for anosognosia for hemiparesis using the anosognosia scale of Bisiach et al.

Results

94% of the patients who were rated as having "mild anosognosia"-that is, they did not acknowledge their hemiparesis spontaneously following a general question about their complaints-suffered from, and mentioned, other neurological deficits such as dysarthria, ptosis, or headache. However, they immediately acknowledged their paresis when they were asked about the strength of their limbs. Their other deficits clearly had a greater impact. These patients had significantly milder paresis than those who denied their disorder even when asked directly about their limbs.

Conclusions

Patients who do not mention their paresis spontaneously but do so when questioned about it directly should not be diagnosed having "anosognosia". If this more conservative cut off criterion is applied to the data of the present as well as previous studies, a frequency of between 10% and 18% for anosognosia for hemiparesis is obtained in unselected samples of acute hemiparetic stroke patients. The incidence thus seems smaller than previously assumed.

### 16p13.11 microdeletion in a patient with hemiconvulsion-hemiplegia-epilepsy syndrome: a case report [^8cd48795]. Journal of Child Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

We describe a patient with hemiconvulsion-hemiplegia-epilepsy syndrome. The pathophysiology of hemiconvulsion-hemiplegia-epilepsy syndrome remains uncertain and there are probably multiple potential contributing factors. Our patient had a chromosomal 16p13.11 microdeletion that confers susceptibility to various types of epilepsy. This is the first report detailing an association of hemiconvulsion-hemiplegia-epilepsy syndrome with a 16p13.11 deletion and identifies another potential causal factor for hemiconvulsion-hemiplegia-epilepsy syndrome.

### Recurrent de novo mutations in CLDN5 induce an anion-selective blood-brain barrier and alternating hemiplegia [^2e6c4da3]. Brain (2022). Medium credibility.

Alternating hemiplegia of childhood is a rare early-onset condition affecting ∼1 in 1 million people globally. It is characterized by repeated episodes of transient hemiplegia (lack of motor control on one side of the body), tonic or dystonic attacks (muscle spasms), nystagmus (involuntary eye movement) and choreoathetotic movement (involuntary twitching/writhing). Episodes of quadriplegia can also occur either when a hemiplegia shifts from one side to the other or as an isolated manifestation. Acute episodes are frequently severe and can be followed by cognitive deterioration. Although patients also present with epileptic seizures, the condition is traditionally regarded as being distinct from epilepsy.

Alternating hemiplegia has been occasionally ascribed to pathogenic variants in several ion channel genes including SCN1A, CACNA1A, ATP1A3 and ATP1A2. In the case of mutations in ATP1A3 or ATP1A2, the mutations lead to reduced activity of Na + /K + ATPase, and affect its ability to efficiently transport ions. While alternating hemiplegia is classified as an autosomal dominant condition, almost all cases are as a result of de novo mutations.

Here we show that a single, recurrent de novo pathogenic variant (c.178G > A) in the CLDN5 gene converts the tight junction into an anion-selective channel, causing an alternating hemiplegia in two unrelated patients. The concept of the BBB being converted into an anion-selective channel has implications for how we understand hemiplegia. Additionally, considering CLDN5 associated hemiplegia as a channelopathy opens avenues to therapeutic intervention of this debilitating condition. Notwithstanding the importance of this observation to hemiplegia, its relevance to tight junction and BBB biology also has major implications for our understanding of barrier function and transport mechanisms in the brain in general.

### Mental practice for treating upper extremity deficits in individuals with hemiparesis after stroke [^d7f60fdf]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Stroke is caused by the interruption of blood flow to the brain (ischemic stroke) or the rupture of blood vessels within the brain (hemorrhagic stroke) and may lead to changes in perception, cognition, mood, speech, health-related quality of life, and function, such as difficulty walking and using the arm. Activity limitations (decreased function) of the upper extremity are a common finding for individuals living with stroke. Mental practice (MP) is a training method that uses cognitive rehearsal of activities to improve performance of those activities.

Objectives

To determine whether MP improves outcomes of upper extremity rehabilitation for individuals living with the effects of stroke. In particular, we sought to (1) determine the effects of MP on upper extremity activity, upper extremity impairment, activities of daily living, health-related quality of life, economic costs, and adverse effects; and (2) explore whether effects differed according to (a) the time post stroke at which MP was delivered, (b) the dose of MP provided, or (c) the type of comparison performed.

Search Methods

We last searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register on September 17, 2019. On September 3, 2019, we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (the Cochrane Library), MEDLINE, Embase, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), PsycINFO, Scopus, Web of Science, the Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro), and REHABDATA. On October 2, 2019, we searched ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. We reviewed the reference lists of included studies.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of adult participants with stroke who had deficits in upper extremity function (called upper extremity activity).

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors screened titles and abstracts of the citations produced by the literature search and excluded obviously irrelevant studies. We obtained the full text of all remaining studies, and both review authors then independently selected trials for inclusion. We combined studies when the review produced a minimum of two trials employing a particular intervention strategy and a common outcome. We considered the primary outcome to be the ability of the arm to be used for appropriate tasks, called upper extremity activity. Secondary outcomes included upper extremity impairment (such as quality of movement, range of motion, tone, presence of synergistic movement), activities of daily living (ADLs), health-related quality of life (HRQL), economic costs, and adverse events. We assessed risk of bias in the included studies and applied GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence. We completed subgroup analyses for time since stroke, dosage of MP, type of comparison, and type of arm activity outcome measure.

Main Results

We included 25 studies involving 676 participants from nine countries. For the comparison of MP in addition to other treatment versus the other treatment, MP in combination with other treatment appears more effective in improving upper extremity activity than the other treatment without MP (standardized mean difference [SMD] 0.66, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.39 to 0.94; I² = 39%; 15 studies; 397 participants); the GRADE certainty of evidence score was moderate based on risk of bias for the upper extremity activity outcome. For upper extremity impairment, results were as follows: SMD 0.59, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.87; I² = 43%; 15 studies; 397 participants, with a GRADE score of moderate, based on risk of bias. For ADLs, results were as follows: SMD 0.08, 95% CI -0.24 to 0.39; I² = 0%; 4 studies; 157 participants; the GRADE score was low due to risk of bias and small sample size. For the comparison of MP versus conventional treatment, the only outcome with available data to combine (3 studies; 50 participants) was upper extremity impairment (SMD 0.34, 95% CI -0.33 to 1.00; I² = 21%); GRADE for the impairment outcome in this comparison was low due to risk of bias and small sample size. Subgroup analyses of time post stroke, dosage of MP, or comparison type for the MP in combination with other rehabilitation treatment versus the other treatment comparison showed no differences. The secondary outcome of health-related quality of life was reported in only one study, and no study noted the outcomes of economic costs and adverse events.

Authors' Conclusions

Moderate-certainty evidence shows that MP in addition to other treatment versus the other treatment appears to be beneficial in improving upper extremity activity. Moderate-certainty evidence also shows that MP in addition to other treatment versus the other treatment appears to be beneficial in improving upper extremity impairment after stroke. Low-certainty evidence suggests that ADLs may not be improved with MP in addition to other treatment versus the other treatment. Low-certainty evidence also suggests that MP versus conventional treatment may not improve upper extremity impairment. Further study is required to evaluate effects of MP on time post stroke, the volume of MP required to affect outcomes, and whether improvement is maintained over the long term.

### Guidelines for adult stroke rehabilitation and recovery: a guideline for healthcare professionals from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^c9786a3b]. Stroke (2016). Medium credibility.

American Heart Association/American Stroke Association hemiplegic shoulder pain after stroke — interventions to prevent the onset of and to treat shoulder pain in patients with stroke-related hemiplegia include proper positioning, maintenance of shoulder range of motion, and motor retraining. For people in wheelchairs, lap trays and arm troughs might be useful positioning devices to reduce shoulder pain and subluxation. Some suggest that consistent performance of aggressive passive range-of-motion exercises may reduce or prevent later shoulder problems, but the evidence in support of or against this suggestion is missing, and aggressive range of motion of the complex shoulder joint, if done improperly, could do more harm than good. The use of slings, especially during ambulation training to protect the shoulder from traction injury, may be considered, and the use of overhead pulley exercises should be avoided. There are a few RCTs with mixed results on shoulder strapping for the prevention of shoulder pain after acute stroke; in the largest, investigators randomized 162 patients with acute stroke to either shoulder taping or sham taping, and there was a trend toward a difference in visual analog pain scale and pain-related disability scores over 30 days, but these differences were not statistically or clinically significant. Currently, there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the efficacy of shoulder strapping (taping) for the prevention of hemiplegic shoulder pain. Acupuncture in combination with standard therapeutic exercise may be a safe and effective adjuvant for the treatment of hemiplegic shoulder pain; a review found 7 RCTs, all showing positive effects, although the authors could not recommend concrete conclusions because of the limited number of available trials. Various types of skin surface electrical stimulation, including transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) and NMES, have been evaluated, but these modalities have not been evaluated sufficiently.

### Cerebral palsy in children: a clinical practice review [^aba8618c]. Current Problems in Pediatric and Adolescent Health Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Cerebral palsy is a disorder characterized by abnormal tone, posture, and movement. In clinical practice, it is often useful to approach cerebral palsy based on the predominant motor system findings - spastic hemiplegia, spastic diplegia, spastic quadriplegia, extrapyramidal or dyskinetic, and ataxic. The prevalence of cerebral palsy is between 1.5 and 3 per 1,000 live births with higher percentage of cases in low to middle income countries and geographic regions. Pre-term birth and low birthweight are recognized as the most frequent risk factors for cerebral palsy; other risk factors include hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, maternal infections, and multiple gestation. In most cases of cerebral palsy, the initial injury to the brain occurs during early fetal brain development. Intracerebral hemorrhage and periventricular leukomalacia are the main pathologic findings found in preterm infants who develop spastic cerebral palsy. The diagnosis of cerebral palsy is primarily based on clinical findings. Early recognition of infants at risk for cerebral palsy as well as those with cerebral palsy is possible based on a combination of clinical history, use of standardized neuromotor assessment and findings on magnetic resonance imaging; however, in clinical practice, cerebral palsy is more reliably diagnosed by 2 years of age. Magnetic resonance imaging scan is indicated to delineate the extent of brain lesions and to identify congenital brain malformations. Genetic testing and tests for inborn errors of metabolism are indicated to identify specific disorders, especially treatable disorders. Because cerebral palsy is associated with multiple associated and secondary medical conditions, its management requires a sustained and consistent collaboration among multiple disciplines and specialties. With appropriate support, most children with cerebral palsy grow up to be adults with good functional abilities.

### Problems in rehabilitation of the hemiplegic patient… [^789b455c]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

The new philosophy of the treatment of hemiplegia emphasizes attention to the portions of the body that remain functional. But it must be recognized that brain damage limits the goals of rehabilitation. Among the 122 patients here studied, there were 23 judged to be physically able to return to work, but of the 11 with right-sided hemiplegia, 6 are now employed, while of the 12 with left-sided hemiplegia, only 2 are now employed. Vocational rehabilitation was thus more likely in patients with involvement of the dominant hemisphere. Much can be done for the patient during the first 7 to 10 days of flaccidity, during the ensuing period of spasticity, and finally during the period of retraining in ambulation and self-care By early and persistent use of what is available, especially in the choice of assistive devices, many hemiplegic patients can be made self-sufficient, thus relieving their families and friends of much of the burden of their care.

### Unusual form of proprioceptive facilitation during recovery from hemiplegia [^45e2a806]. Movement Disorders (2006). Low credibility.

Proprioceptive facilitation (PF) is a phenomenon occasionally seen during motor restoration following acute hemiplegia. At an early stage of recovery, a number of brief passive muscle stretches can facilitate voluntary contraction in the stretched muscles. Here we present a patient who during early recovery from a left hemispheric stroke causing right hemiplegia was able to develop maximum isometric arm force if, during this effort, large-amplitude passive stretches of the elbow were applied as conditioning stimuli. Based on clinical and positron emission tomography findings, possible physiological mechanisms of PF and the role of proprioception in stroke recovery are discussed.

### Physical rehabilitation approaches for the recovery of function and mobility following stroke [^846c6a46]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Data extraction and management

One review author extracted study characteristics from study reports into a pre‐piloted standardised form and a second author checked the extracted study characteristics (involving CS, JC, PC, ATB). Outcome data were extracted independently by two review authors (CS, ATB); one extracted data into a pre‐piloted standardised form and the other extracted data directly into RevMan 2024, and data were compared to identify any discrepancies. The review authors resolved disagreements by discussion, involving a third review author if necessary.

Data extracted included the following (when possible): study aim; trial setting (e.g. hospital, community); geographical location; details of participants (side of hemiplegia, type of stroke, time since stroke); health equity (using PROGRESS domains, O'Neill 2014); inclusion and exclusion criteria; all assessed outcomes; intervention details; funding and conflicts of interest. The review authors resolved disagreements by discussion and contacted study authors for clarification when necessary. For papers published in the Chinese language, one review author (PLC) verbally translated relevant sections of text, during an audio‐recorded meeting with a second author (PC), who documented relevant data extraction items. For papers published in languages other than English or Chinese, we sought a relevant translation of the paper.

Extracted data were managed in Excel. We categorised all studies according to whether they had data suitable for inclusion within quantitative analysis, or were included in qualitative synthesis only; and the nature of the study comparison. We categorised each study comparison with consideration of the dose of delivered interventions, as follows:

Physical rehabilitation versus no physical rehabilitation or versus limited physical rehabilitation (dose differs). Limited physical rehabilitation was defined as being a dose of < 50% of the treatment group.
Physical rehabilitation versus attention control (dose of physical rehabilitation differs between groups; dose of intervention equivalent in both groups).
Additional physical rehabilitation plus usual therapy versus usual therapy.
Comparison of different physical rehabilitation approaches (dose equivalent). This was further subcategorised according to whether the treatment groups were receiving any other physical rehabilitation (i.e. both groups may have received some 'standard' intervention).

These categories informed the analyses in which studies were included (for studies included in quantitative analyses).

### Reply: De novo mutations in CLDN5: alternating hemiplegia of childhood or not? [^565315d7]. Brain (2023). Medium credibility.

We thank our colleagues Panagiotakaki et al.for their interest in our recent work elucidating the functional relevance of the G60R mutation in the CLDN5 gene in two unrelated cases of children presenting with alternating hemiplegia. Our study represents the first report of a dominant acting mutation in the coding sequence of the CLDN5 gene and has, we believe, major implications for our understanding of blood–brain barrier (BBB) function and tight junction biology in general.

In reference to queries from patients and patient groups, we would posit that mutations in CLDN5 are most certainly not going to be a leading cause of alternating hemiplegia of childhood (AHC). However, while further research on BBB disruption and indeed the possibility of CLDN5 variants being causative of hemiplegia is warranted, it would not be an arduous exercise to include CLDN5 screening in any case of suspected hemiplegia or AHC in our opinion.

We appreciate that the on-going search for the genetic cause of AHC will present differential diagnoses that deviate from that of the 80% of cases attributed to the ATP1A3 gene. In that regard, we would also stress that we certainly do not believe, nor have we stated in our study, that a large proportion of genetically undiagnosed patients will harbour the G60R mutation. We have no doubt that the remaining 20% of genetically undiagnosed cases likely represent multiple rare variants in a large cohort of genes similar to the two cases we described in our report.

In relation to the specific questions posed with regard to the clinical details of the patients reported in our study, both patients had recurrent episodes of alternating hemiplegia (different sides) over a period of years. These episodes had a duration over 24 h without seizures prior to the episodes. Resolution with sleep was not easily determined due to the different use of medications. We did conduct EEG analysis, and EEG tracing during the hemiplegic episodes did not show evidence of seizures with slow waves only.

Brain imaging in both patients excluded stroke like episodes (SLE), which are frequently associated with mitochondrial disorders. After admission, patients eventually recovered their previous neurological status with ataxia and mild cognitive impairment. Based on our clinical evaluation, we do support the idea that the clinical presentation is compatible with the AHC criteria of Aicardi.

We are always willing to share our experience and expertise and would be delighted to expand this discussion along with our future plans exploring the role of the BBB in hemiplegia and AHC. We look forward to continued engagement with our colleagues.

### Faulty cardiac repolarization reserve in alternating hemiplegia of childhood broadens the phenotype [^7d36c01b]. Brain (2015). Low credibility.

Our findings suggest that alternating hemiplegia can be considered another cardiocerebral disorder, and that cardiac evaluation, with at least ECG, should be considered in alternating hemiplegia, especially in older (≥ 16 years) patients. Our data do not permit more specific recommendations, but we note that in some cases, dynamic ECG changes of importance were only seen briefly during prolonged recording. The dynamic nature of ECG changes is reflected in the dynamic nature of many neurological symptoms that is typical of alternating hemiplegia, and may share a mechanistic explanation, though we note that there is obviously no link between the actual timing of ECG and neurological changes. The absence of ECG changes during a seizure or plegic episode does not preclude the existence of ECG changes at other times in the same individual.

We note that the general concept of 'cardiocerebral channelopathy' is further underpinned by several recent reports of cardiac arrhythmia, such as long QT syndrome or Brugada syndrome, in single individuals or kindreds with epilepsy due to mutations in ion channel genes such as KCNH2 and KCNQ1.

### Familial hemiplegic migraine in a child with seizure disorder: clinical history is the key to diagnosis [^7ae7a11b]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

Headache is a common presenting complaint in the paediatric population, with often migraine being a clinical diagnosis. Hemiplegic migraine is characterised by aura, sudden onset weakness of one side of the body which usually recovers without any residual neurological deficit. We report a child with a history of seizure disorder, well controlled and off medication for 3years, who presented with a headache, aura and transient hemiplegia. Similar history in the patient's mother suggests the diagnosis of familial hemiplegic migraine. We would like to emphasise the importance of detailed history as an important aid in the diagnosis of neurological disorders in children.

### Efficacy of upper extremity robotic therapy in subacute poststroke hemiplegia: an exploratory randomized trial [^837f9a59]. Stroke (2016). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Our aim was to study the efficacy of robotic therapy as an adjuvant to standard therapy during poststroke rehabilitation.

Methods

Prospective, open, blinded end point, randomized, multicenter exploratory clinical trial in Japan of 60 individuals with mild to moderate hemiplegia 4 to 8 weeks post stroke randomized to receive standard therapy plus 40 minutes of either robotic or self-guided therapy for 6 weeks (7 days/week). Upper extremity impairment before and after intervention was measured using the Fugl-Meyer assessment, Wolf Motor Function Test, and Motor Activity Log.

Results

Robotic therapy significantly improved Fugl-Meyer assessment flexor synergy (2.1 ± 2.7 versus -0.1 ± 2.4; P < 0.01) and proximal upper extremity (4.8 ± 5.0 versus 1.9 ± 5.5; P < 0.05) compared with self-guided therapy. No significant changes in Wolf Motor Function Test or Motor Activity Log were observed. Robotic therapy also significantly improved Fugl-Meyer assessment proximal upper extremity among low-functioning patients (baseline Fugl-Meyer assessment score < 30) and among patients with Wolf Motor Function Test ≥ 120 at baseline compared with self-guided therapy (P < 0.05 for both).

Conclusions

Robotic therapy as an adjuvant to standard rehabilitation may improve upper extremity recovery in moderately impaired poststroke patients. Results of this exploratory study should be interpreted with caution.

### Rapid on-line control to reaching is preserved in children with congenital spastic hemiplegia: evidence from double-step reaching performance [^68686c98]. Journal of Child Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

This study aimed to investigate the integrity of on-line control of reaching in congenital spastic hemiplegia in light of disparate evidence. Twelve children with and without spastic hemiplegia (11–17 years old) completed a double-step reaching task requiring them to reach and touch a target that remained stationary for most trials (viz nonjump trial) but unexpectedly displaced laterally at movement onset for a minority of trials (20%: known as jump trials). Although children with spastic hemiplegia were generally slower than age-matched controls, they could account for target perturbation at age-appropriate levels shown by a lack of interaction effect on movement time and nonsignificant group difference for time to reach trajectory correction on jump trials. Our data suggest that at a group level, on-line control of reaching may be age-appropriate in spastic hemiplegia. However, our data also highlight the need to experimentally acknowledge the considerable heterogeneity of the spastic hemiplegia population when investigating motor cognition.

### Guidelines for adult stroke rehabilitation and recovery: a guideline for healthcare professionals from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^d42ca4f5]. Stroke (2016). Medium credibility.

Hemiplegic shoulder pain — assessment, prevention, and treatment recommendations include the following: patient and family education is recommended for shoulder pain and shoulder care after stroke, particularly before discharge or transitions in care; botulinum toxin injection can be useful to reduce severe hypertonicity in hemiplegic shoulder muscles; a trial of neuropathic pain medications is reasonable for patients with clinical signs and symptoms of neuropathic pain manifested as sensory change in the shoulder region, allodynia, or hyperpathia; it is reasonable to consider positioning and use of supportive devices and slings for shoulder subluxation; a clinical assessment can be useful, including musculoskeletal evaluation, evaluation of spasticity, identification of any subluxation, and testing for regional sensory changes; neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) may be considered (surface or intramuscular) for shoulder pain; ultrasound may be considered as a diagnostic tool for shoulder soft tissue injury; usefulness of acupuncture as an adjuvant treatment for hemiplegic shoulder pain is of uncertain value; usefulness of subacromial or glenohumeral corticosteroid injection for patients with inflammation in these locations is not well established; suprascapular nerve block may be considered as an adjunctive treatment for hemiplegic shoulder pain; surgical tenotomy of pectoralis major, latissimus dorsi, teres major, or subscapularis may be considered for patients with severe hemiplegia and restrictions in shoulder range of motion; and the use of overhead pulley exercises is not recommended.

### Motor-improvement following intensive training in low-functioning chronic hemiparesis [^ebcb8923]. Neurology (2003). Low credibility.

Constraint-induced movement therapy can improve chronic hemiparesis, but this technique has proven difficult to transfer into clinical practice. The authors studied the benefits of a modified regimen designed to be applicable in the clinical environment. Affected arm movements were trained for 90 min/d for 3 weeks using the learning principle "shaping". The outcome measures indicated a significant increase in performance after the intervention compared with the performance during the 3-week baseline interval.

### Distal radius fracture treatment outcomes in patients with ipsilateral hemiplegia or hemiparesis [^29dc04a5]. Hand (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Little information exists to guide decision-making with regard to distal radius fractures in the setting of ipsilateral hemiparesis or hemiplegia.

Methods

Patients who sustained a distal radius fracture in the setting of ipsilateral hemiparesis or hemiplegia secondary to brain injury were evaluated. Investigated variables included perioperative pain, preinjury House functional classification score, length of immobilization, radiographic outcome measurements, and time to union.

Results

There were 15 patients with distal radius fractures with a mean age of 65.9 years. The mean clinical and radiographic follow-up was 2.8 and 2.9 years, respectively. Wrists were placed into the nonoperative group (NOG, n = 10) and operative group (OG, n = 5). Pain significantly decreased at final follow-up for both groups. Baseline House functional classification scores averaged 1.3 and 1.6 for the NOG and OG, respectively, and were maintained at final follow-up. Length of immobilization for the NOG was 46 days and OG was 37 days, P = 0.15. Radiographic outcomes at final follow-up in the NOG and OG, respectively, were a mean radial height of 9.3 versus. 11.6 mm, radial inclination of 18.3° versus 22.3°, 4.2° dorsal tilt versus 5.3° volar tilt, and tear drop angle of 45.6° versus 44.5°. There were no significant differences in these measurements. Time to radiographic union averaged 58 days for the NOG and 67 days for the OG, P = 0.42. There were no revision surgeries.

Conclusions

Based on this small case series, patients with distal radius fracture and ipsilateral hemiparesis or hemiplegia may have similar clinical, functional, and radiographic outcomes, regardless of nonoperative or operative treatment.

### Nonoperative management of humerus fractures in patients with ispilateral hemiparesis or hemiplegia [^7641a0e3]. Hand (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Patients with upper limb dysfunction from a brain injury often have different goals of treatment and expectations following a fracture of the upper extremity. This study retrospectively reviewed outcomes of nonoperative management of acute humerus fractures in patients with severe ipsilateral hemiparesis or hemiplegia.

Methods

Patients who had sustained an acute humerus fracture managed nonoperatively, greater than 1 year following an upper motor neuron (UMN) injury resulting in ipsilateral severe hemiparesis or hemiplegia at a single tertiary care center from 1988 to 2019, were reviewed. Fractures were classified using the AO-Müller/Orthopaedic Trauma Association and/or Neer classifications. Primary outcome measures included House classification level of function, pain, achievement of and time to radiographic union, and the need for subsequent surgical procedures.

Results

Ten distinct nonoperatively managed humerus fractures-3 proximal (11A23), 5 mid-shaft (12A2b = 1, 12A2c = 2, 12A3a = 1, 12A2b = 1), and 2 distal (13A2 = 1, 13 C1 = 1)-were identified in 8 patients (6 women and 2 men) with ipsilateral hemiparesis or hemiplegia. The median radiographic follow-up was 20 months (range: 78 days to 12 years). The median clinical follow-up was 33.5 months (range: 100 days to 12 years). All patients presented with severe pain that was absent at final follow-up. Radiographic union was achieved in all patients with a mean time to union of 90.9 ± 39.3 days (range: 35–185 days). No patients required operative management.

Conclusions

Nonoperative management of humerus fractures in patients with an ipsilateral UMN injury might result in reliable pain relief and union without the need for further surgical intervention. Management of humerus fractures in this patient population should be individualized toward their goals of care.

### Comparative effectiveness of botulinum toxin injections and extracorporeal shockwave therapy for post-stroke spasticity: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^0fd5020a]. EClinicalMedicine (2022). Medium credibility.

2 Methods

The present network meta-analysis was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) extension guidelines for network meta-analysis (PRISMA-NMA), and was prospectively registered on inplasy.com (INPLASY202170018). The data used to support the findings of this research are available within the main article and its online supplementary files.

2.1 Search strategy

We searched four electronic databases (PubMed, EMBASE, MEDLINE and Cochrane CENTRAL) for relevant articles published from the earliest records up to September 2021. Other data sources such as the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and ClinicalTrials.gov were also searched for eligible articles. Moreover, we manually screened the reference lists of the included articles for pertinent trials. The following PICO (i.e. Population/Patient, Intervention, Comparison, and Outcome) question guided the search strategy: "In patients with post-stroke spasticity, which kind of intervention among BoNT injections, RSW, and FSW, has a better effect in spasticity reduction when compared with others?" The following keywords were used: "stroke", "cerebrovascular disease", "cerebral infarction", "intracerebral hemorrhage", "hemiplegia", "hemiparesis", "spasticity", "hypertonia", "shock wave", "shockwave therapy", and "botulinum toxin" during the literature search without language limitations. The databases were investigated based on the following algorithm: [[(stroke OR cerebrovascular disease OR cerebral infarction OR intracerebral hemorrhage OR hemiplegia OR hemiparesis) and (spasticity OR hypertonia) and (shock wave OR shockwave therapy)] OR [(stroke OR cerebrovascular disease OR cerebral infarction OR intracerebral hemorrhage OR hemiplegia OR hemiparesis) and (spasticity OR hypertonia) and botulinum toxin]]. The complete search strategy is presented in the Supplementary Method.

### Ipsilateral hemiparesis: the forgotten history of this paradoxical neurological sign [^6bed168b]. Neurosurgical Focus (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

Establishing the neurological localization doctrine for the contralateral hemispheric control of motor functions in the second half of the 19th century, researchers faced the challenge of recognizing false localizing signs, in particular paradoxical or ipsilateral hemiparesis (IH). Despite tremendous progress in current methods of neuroradiological and electrophysiological exploration, a complete understanding of this phenomenon has yet to be attained.

Methods

The authors researched the well-described cases of hemiparesis/hemiplegia ipsilateral to an intracranial lesion published in the scientific literature in the pre-MRI era (before 1980). A comprehensive review of the physiopathological mechanisms proposed for paradoxical hemiparesis throughout this period, as well as the pathological evidence substantiating them, is provided.

Results

A collection of 75 patients with hemiparesis/hemiplegia ipsilateral to the primary intracranial lesion reported between 1858 and 1979 were eligible for analysis. Most cases occurred in adults with supratentorial, slowly developing, extraparenchymatous mass lesions, such as neoplasms (38%) or chronic subdural hematomas (36%). Physiopathological theories proposed by the neurologists who investigated IH can be grouped into 4 major concepts: 1) lack of anatomical decussation of the corticospinal tract; 2) impaired functional activation of the contralateral hemisphere by the lesioned dominant hemisphere through the callosal connections; 3) Kernohan's notch phenomenon, or mechanical injury of the contralateral cerebral peduncle against the free edge of the tentorium; and 4) cerebrovascular dysfunction involving the contralateral hemisphere owing to kinking and mechanical flattening of the carotid artery contralateral to the primary intracranial lesion.

Conclusions

IH represents a still underdiagnosed paradoxical neurological phenomenon. With the aid of modern neuroradiological and neurophysiological methods, Kernohan's peduncle notch mechanism has been confirmed to cause IH in many of the cases reported in recent decades. Nevertheless, alternative functional and/or vascular mechanisms must be investigated further for unexplained IH cases, in particular for transitory IH without evidence of peduncle injury. The historical theories reviewed in this paper represent a conceptual framework that may be helpful for this purpose.

### Faulty cardiac repolarization reserve in alternating hemiplegia of childhood broadens the phenotype [^161584a0]. Brain (2015). Low credibility.

Alternating hemiplegia of childhood is rare and usually results from mutations in cardiac- and brain-expressed ATP1A3. In an ECG study of 52 cases, Jaffer et al. reveal dynamic cardiac repolarisation or conduction abnormalities in over 50%. Abnormalities are more common in those ≥ 16 years, and suggest impaired cardiac repolarisation reserve.

### Guidelines for adult stroke rehabilitation and recovery: a guideline for healthcare professionals from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^d550935b]. Stroke (2016). Medium credibility.

Limb apraxia — evidence overview: Limb apraxia is "a decrease or difficulty in performing purposeful, skilled movements" that cannot be attributed to hemiplegia or lack of effort and is more common after left hemispheric than right hemispheric stroke. Several systematic reviews have been conducted since 2005, reviewing 5 small RCTs across the 4 reviews; since these reviews, no additional RCTs and only 1 case study have been published. Two reviews concluded that there was not enough information to determine whether interventions for apraxia were efficacious, and although some studies have found immediate postintervention improvements on apraxia tests or in daily life activities, few have found lasting advantages for the trained groups.

### Faulty cardiac repolarization reserve in alternating hemiplegia of childhood broadens the phenotype [^ad94bab7]. Brain (2015). Low credibility.

Alternating hemiplegia of childhood is a rare disorder caused by de novo mutations in the ATP1A3 gene, expressed in neurons and cardiomyocytes. As affected individuals may survive into adulthood, we use the term 'alternating hemiplegia'. The disorder is characterized by early-onset, recurrent, often alternating, hemiplegic episodes; seizures and non-paroxysmal neurological features also occur. Dysautonomia may occur during hemiplegia or in isolation. Premature mortality can occur in this patient group and is not fully explained. Preventable cardiorespiratory arrest from underlying cardiac dysrhythmia may be a cause. We analysed ECG recordings of 52 patients with alternating hemiplegia from nine countries: all had whole-exome, whole-genome, or direct Sanger sequencing of ATP1A3. Data on autonomic dysfunction, cardiac symptoms, medication, and family history of cardiac disease or sudden death were collected. All had 12-lead electrocardiogram recordings available for cardiac axis, cardiac interval, repolarization pattern, and J-point analysis. Where available, historical and prolonged single-lead electrocardiogram recordings during electrocardiogram-videotelemetry were analysed. Half the cohort (26/52) had resting 12-lead electrocardiogram abnormalities: 25/26 had repolarization (T wave) abnormalities. These abnormalities were significantly more common in people with alternating hemiplegia than in an age-matched disease control group of 52 people with epilepsy. The average corrected QT interval was significantly shorter in people with alternating hemiplegia than in the disease control group. J wave or J-point changes were seen in six people with alternating hemiplegia. Over half the affected cohort (28/52) had intraventricular conduction delay, or incomplete right bundle branch block, a much higher proportion than in the normal population or disease control cohort (P = 0.0164). Abnormalities in alternating hemiplegia were more common in those ≥ 16 years old, compared with those < 16 (P = 0.0095), even with a specific mutation (p.D801N; P = 0.045). Dynamic, beat-to-beat or electrocardiogram-to-electrocardiogram, changes were noted, suggesting the prevalence of abnormalities was underestimated. Electrocardiogram changes occurred independently of seizures or plegic episodes. Electrocardiogram abnormalities are common in alternating hemiplegia, have characteristics reflecting those of inherited cardiac channelopathies and most likely amount to impaired repolarization reserve. The dynamic electrocardiogram and neurological features point to periodic systemic decompensation in ATP1A3-expressing organs. Cardiac dysfunction may account for some of the unexplained premature mortality of alternating hemiplegia. Systematic cardiac investigation is warranted in alternating hemiplegia of childhood, as cardiac arrhythmic morbidity and mortality are potentially preventable.

### International consensus definitions for infection-triggered encephalopathy syndromes [^f18db5ff]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

What this paper adds
Infection‐triggered encephalopathy syndrome (ITES) is defined following international expert opinion.
Five specific ITESs were defined.
Each syndrome is characterized by specific clinical and radiological phenotypes.
Core ITES criteria include the presence of a febrile illness followed by neurological symptoms including encephalopathy.
The diagnosis of ITES requires the exclusion of encephalitis and other causes of encephalopathy.

Acute encephalopathy is generally defined as a pathobiological brain process that develops acutely and is characterized by impaired consciousness and/or altered mental status. This term refers to a clinical state rather than a disease, and includes a variety of causes, including metabolic, hypoxic–ischaemic, and autoimmune/immune‐mediated encephalopathies, and drug intoxication. In paediatrics, acute encephalopathy is often secondary to infection.

An important acute neurological syndrome associated with viral infections is primary encephalitis, which is caused by the invasion of a neurotropic virus into the brain. Various viral infections can also induce autoimmune/immune‐mediated reactions against the central nervous system (CNS). The most common is acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, and in children autoimmune encephalitis is often triggered by infection. Typically, the mode of onset of autoimmune neurological diseases is 'postinfectious' and the infection is resolved at the time of neurological onset. In contrast, some patients can present with infection and fever which is rapidly followed by encephalopathy; that is, the temporal association is para‐infectious (the infection is still present) rather than postinfectious. When features of encephalitis are absent these can be termed 'infection‐triggered encephalopathy syndromes (ITES)'. ITES frequently presents with encephalopathy and seizures reflecting widespread brain dysfunction, and less frequently with focal symptoms such as hemiplegia, although there may be clinical overlap of neurological symptoms with infectious and autoimmune encephalitis.

### Faulty cardiac repolarization reserve in alternating hemiplegia of childhood broadens the phenotype [^d64b59b5]. Brain (2015). Low credibility.

Three-quarters of our cases had had seizures or had a diagnosis of epilepsy (Table 1 and). ECG abnormalities are recognized, and probably under-reported, in epilepsy. Our findings might be considered to reflect the seizure disorders in our patients with epilepsy, but we show that the prevalence both of any abnormality and of repolarization abnormalities is significantly higher in the alternating hemiplegia cases than in an age-matched disease control cohort of people with epilepsy. Moreover, not all patients with ECG abnormalities had epilepsy, and our findings illustrate that in alternating hemiplegia, somatic (cardiac) co-morbidity is not temporally related to plegic episodes or seizures, but probably due to shared expression in heart and brain of mutated protein. In a knock-in mouse model of alternating hemiplegia, with the D801N mutation, there is a higher incidence of sudden death than expected: some mice had witnessed seizure-related death, considered to be SUDEP, but there were also mice 'found dead' and others who died 'spontaneously'. Sudden premature death in alternating hemiplegia is not always explained. It has been ascribed to cardiorespiratory dysfunction, for which our findings provide a further basis. Our findings may have broader application to the concept of independent cardiac dysfunction as a mechanism for some cases of sudden death in epilepsy, especially with increasing numbers of channels and channel-related pathways being causally implicated in epilepsy. Systematic evaluation of function in organs sharing expression of mutated genes needs consideration with any newly-discovered genetic cause of a condition. In alternating hemiplegia, study of other systems that express ATP1A3 should also be considered. Systematic longitudinal cardiac studies are also now necessary in alternating hemiplegia, as cardiac arrhythmic death is potentially preventable.

### Stroke in newborn infants [^83e6262f]. The Lancet: Neurology (2004). Medium credibility.

The few days before and after birth are a time of special risk for stroke in both mother and infant, probably related to activation of coagulation mechanisms in this critical period. Arterial ischaemic stroke around the time of birth is recognised in about one in 4000 full-term infants, and may present with neurological and systemic signs in the newborn. Neonatal seizures are most commonly the clinical finding that triggers assessment. In other children, perinatal stroke is recognised only retrospectively, with emerging hemiparesis or seizures after the early months of life. Risk factors for perinatal stroke include hereditary or acquired thrombophilias and environmental factors. Perinatal stroke underlies an important share of congenital hemiplegic cerebral palsy, and probably some spastic quadriplegic cerebral palsy and seizure disorders. There is much to be learned about the natural history of perinatal stroke, and there are as yet no evidence-based strategies for prevention or treatment.

### Effects of home-based telesupervising rehabilitation on physical function for stroke survivors with hemiplegia: a randomized controlled trial [^fce182d1]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

The aims of this work were to evaluate the effects of home-based telesupervising rehabilitation on physical function for stroke survivors with hemiplegia and to determine if the rehabilitation therapy can relieve the burden on caregivers.

Design

This study is a randomized, controlled, assessor-blinded trial. Stroke survivors were randomly assigned to either home-based telesupervising rehabilitation group or conventional rehabilitation group to receive physical exercise and electromyography-triggered neuromuscular stimulation. Modified Barthel Index, Berg Balance Scale, modified Rankin Scale, Caregiver Strain Index, root mean square of extensor carpi radialis longus and tibialis anterior muscle were measured at 3 time points: baseline, postintervention (12 weeks), and 12-week follow-up (24 weeks).

Results

Both the home-based telerehabilitation and conventional rehabilitation groups demonstrated significant effects within groups over the 3 time points in increasing Modified Barthel Index, Berg Balance Scale, and root mean square value of extensor carpi radialis longus and tibialis anterior, as well as decreasing Caregiver Strain Index (P < 0.001), but none of the between-group differences was significant. For modified Rankin Scale, the percentage of participants of grades 0 and 1 in 2 groups increased over time without significant difference between the groups.

Conclusions

Home-based telesupervising rehabilitation is most likely as effective as the conventional outpatient rehabilitation for improving functional recovery in stroke survivors and could ease the burden of caregivers as conventional rehabilitation.

### Recurrent de novo mutations in CLDN5 induce an anion-selective blood-brain barrier and alternating hemiplegia [^e7c64057]. Brain (2022). Medium credibility.

The brainstem calcification we observed in the two patients is reminiscent of and closely similar to that observed in patients carrying biallelic mutations in occludinor junctional adhesion molecule 2 (JAM2), another tight junction protein of the BBB. Both occludin and JAM2 are mainly expressed in endothelial cells in the CNS. The contribution of JAM2 to the integrity of the tight junction in the BBB may be minorbut occludin is known to enhance the complexity of tight junction strands and the knockdown of occludin attenuated TEER of a brain endothelial cell line. Indeed, levels of occludin are also frequently perturbed in a range of neurological conditions and it is likely that decreases in its levels at the BBB tight junction contribute to selective ion flux from blood to brain in a manner that will drive pathology. On the other hand, the transient contralateral increase of CBF observed in patients with variant CLDN5 during the acute episodes of hemiplegia is reminiscent of cases of alternating hemiplegia ascribed to pathogenic variants in another ion channel gene, ATP1A3. However, the ASL pattern reported here could not be ascribed to pre- or post-ictal events as no seizure concomitant with the transient episodes of hemiplegia were noted. One can hypothesize that the conversion of the wild-type tight junction protein into a channel-forming mutant claudin-5 protein lowered seizure threshold by disturbing brain microenvironment and transiently triggered neuronal injury similar to the stroke-like episodes observed in Leigh syndrome. It is plausible that when one hemisphere requires vasodilation of contiguous vessels to supply oxygen and ATP, it can compromise the contralateral hemisphere. Indeed, to our knowledge this is also the first ASL evidence of a major contralateral increase of CBF observed in alternating hemiplegia. Beyond its relevance to hemiplegia, the concept of the BBB converting to an anion-selective channel via changes to the extracellular domain of claudin-5 represents a paradigm shift in how we view the BBB.

### Virtual reality in stroke rehabilitation: still more virtual than real [^4f46238c]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose

To assess the utility of virtual reality (VR) in stroke rehabilitation.

Method

The Medline, Proquest, AMED, CINAHL, EMBASE and PsychInfo databases were electronically searched from inception/1980 to February 2005, using the keywords: Virtual reality, rehabilitation, stroke, physiotherapy/physical therapy and hemiplegia. Articles that met the study's inclusion criteria were required to: (i) be published in an English language peer reviewed journal, (ii) involve the use of VR in a stroke rehabilitation setting; and (iii) report impairment and/or activity oriented outcome measures. Two assessors independently assessed each study's quality using the American Academy for Cerebral Palsy and Developmental Medicine (AACPDM) grading system.

Results

Eleven papers met the inclusion criteria: Five addressed upper limb rehabilitation, three gait and balance, two cognitive interventions, and one both upper and lower limb rehabilitation. Three were judged to be AACPDM Level I/Weak, two Level III/Weak, three Level IV/Weak and three Level V quality of evidence. All articles involved before and after interventions; three randomized controlled trials obtained statistical significance, the remaining eight studies found VR-based therapy to be beneficial. None of the studies reported any significant adverse effects.

Conclusion

VR is a potentially exciting and safe tool for stroke rehabilitation but its evidence base is too limited by design and power issues to permit a definitive assessment of its value. Thus, while the findings of this review are generally positive, the level of evidence is still weak to moderate, in terms of research quality. Further study in the form of rigorous controlled studies is warranted.

### Lack of SLC2A1 (glucose transporter 1) mutations in 30 Italian patients with alternating hemiplegia of childhood [^c609884a]. Journal of Child Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

Alternating hemiplegia of childhood is a rare, predominantly sporadic disorder. Diagnosis is clinical, and little is known about genetics. Glucose transporter 1 deficiency syndrome shares with alternating hemiplegia of childhood paroxysmal and nonparoxysmal symptoms. The aim of the study was to investigate glucose transporter 1 mutations in 30 Italian patients. Genetic material was analyzed by DNA amplification and glucose transporter 1 region sequencing. Mutational analysis findings of the SLC2A1 gene were negative in all patients. The pattern of movement disorders was reviewed. Interictal dystonia and multiple paroxysmal events were typical of alternating hemiplegia of childhood. In conclusion, alternating hemiplegia of childhood is a heterogeneous clinical condition, and although glucose transporter 1 deficiency can represent an undiagnosed cause of this disorder, mutational analysis is not routinely recommended. Alternatively, a careful clinical analysis and the 3-O-methyl-D-glucose uptake test can allow prompt identification of a subgroup of patients with alternating hemiplegia of childhood treatable with a ketogenic diet.

### Movement changes due to hemiplegia in stroke survivors: a hermeneutic phenomenological study [^db0d0855]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose

Meanings of movement for stroke survivors could give therapists significant insights, especially during maintenance phase. The purpose of this study was to examine how post-stroke users of a long-term elderly care facility had experienced changes in movement resulting from hemiplegia.

Method

The participants of this study were 18 stroke survivors using a long-term elderly care facility. Based on phenomenology, between two and three interviews were conducted with each participant about their experiences with hemiplegia. Data analysis consisted of the following phases: 'data immersion', 'data transformation' and 'thematic analysis'. This study was approved by the ethics committee of the authors' institution.

Results

Participants experienced seven themes resulting from hemiplegia, perceiving themselves differently from the way they did before the stroke. The themes were as follows: 'inescapable dependence', 'sense of incompetence', 'lack of autonomy', 'symbol of deviation from normal', 'licence for amae', 'security of self-worth' and 'proof of effort'.

Conclusions

The first four themes attempt to express participants' pain and difficulty in living with their present body; the last three attempt to express methods for coping with the present body in the company of others. Results will assist therapists to understand the significant needs of their clients in the maintenance phase. Implications for Rehabilitation Hemiplegia is paralysis of half of the body; it represents one kind of physical disability caused by stroke. Re-interpretation of how patients had experienced the changes of their movements after they had hemiplegia is helpful for the therapists to understand the significant needs for their clients. It may be especially relevant for therapists working with stroke survivors in the maintenance phase, whose functional recovery of physical movements is not expected to occur to a greater extent.

### International consensus definitions for infection-triggered encephalopathy syndromes [^ab01789e]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Aim

To develop standardized diagnostic criteria for 'infection‐triggered encephalopathy syndrome (ITES)' and five specific clinical syndromes of ITES.

Method

The draft definitions were based on existing criteria, standardized, and discussed by a panel of international experts using nominal group technique over 18 months to achieve consensus. All criteria use the same format: (1) presence of infection/fever; (2) clinical features including encephalopathy; (3) neuroradiological features on magnetic resonance imaging; (4) exclusion of other causes.

Results

We first highlighted differences between ITES and infectious and autoimmune encephalitis, which is the most important differential diagnosis. Consensus was achieved to define five specific ITESs: acute encephalopathy with biphasic seizures and late reduced diffusion; acute necrotizing encephalopathy; mild encephalopathy with a reversible splenial lesion; acute fulminant cerebral oedema; and acute shock with encephalopathy and multiorgan failure. Two further conditions that are currently classified as epilepsy syndromes but have similar features to ITES, namely febrile infection‐related epilepsy syndrome and hemiconvulsion–hemiplegia–epilepsy syndrome, are also discussed.

Interpretation

The consensus definition is expected to improve awareness of this disease concept, provide diagnostic framework, and facilitate future international research and clinical trials.

### Hemiplegic migraine with prolonged symptoms: case report [^b321983f]. Journal of Child Neurology (2002). Low credibility.

Hemiplegic migraine is defined by the occurrence of migraine during attacks of unilateral weakness. Neurologic symptoms last for 15 to 60 minutes in most cases. Attacks usually start in childhood, adolescence, or early adulthood. Diagnosis may be delayed if there is no relevant family history. A 16-year-old girl who was diagnosed with hemiplegic migraine presenting with prolonged left hemiparesis is reported. The importance of this case is that the pediatrician will also consider migraine in the differential diagnosis of a child presenting with hemiparesis even if there is no previous headache and family history.

### Reconstruction of paralyzed arm function in patients with hemiplegia through contralateral seventh cervical nerve cross transfer: a multicenter study and real-world practice guidance [^08a21efc]. EClinicalMedicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Cerebral injuries such as stroke, cerebral palsy or traumatic brain injuries, lead to long-term disability in the chronic stage. While two-thirds of patients succeed in walking independently after an injury, less than half regain basic upper limb functions 6 months or longer after the injury, typically suffering unilateral spastic limb paralysis. Strategies to regain function of the paralyzed hand predominantly focus on repairing the injured hemisphere and reducing spasticity of the upper limb, but substantial improvement is rare.

In 1872, Brown-Sequard announced his conjecture "one side of the brain is sufficient for the functional integrity of both sides of the body" in The New England Journal of Medicine (Boston Medical and Surgical Journal at that time). This conjecture is supported by the evidence that infants and children who receive hemispherectomy for intractable epilepsy can gradually rebuild the motion and sensation of the contralateral limb, and the fact that involvement of the contralesional hemisphere during recovery of hand dexterity movement after stroke. These findings indicate that to exploit the potential of the contralesional hemisphere is a potential direction to treat unilateral spastic arm paralysis.

In 2018, we reported the results of treating spastic arm paralysis after chronic brain injury using a new surgical procedure, contralateral seventh cervical nerve (CC7) cross transfer surgery. In this surgery, the seventh cervical nerve of the intact side is mobilized to the paralyzed side and coapted with the ipsilesional seventh cervical nerve; therefore, the paralyzed hand is connected to the contralesional hemisphere. Through a randomized, controlled clinical trial (abbreviated to CONCENT), we showed that CC7 is safe and effective for the treatment of spastic arm paralysis, consist with previous reports. In the CONCENT study, patients were aged 12–45 years and had a disease duration of at least 5 years. Although sex and functional state at baseline were not restricted, patients included were male and mostly had a baseline score in the upper extremity of the Fugl–Meyer (UEFM) scale between 20–40 points. Whether this surgery could be effective in a more inclusive population needs to be explored.

In clinical practice, hemiplegia could be caused by different etiologies, and the extent of functional loss varies according to the lesion area. Moreover, the expected functional improvements need to be approximately anticipated. In this study, we provided this information based on follow-up data from five centers and subgroup analysis, which could be used as a clinical guidance for the usage of CC7 transfer for unilateral spastic arm paralysis.

### Faulty cardiac repolarization reserve in alternating hemiplegia of childhood broadens the phenotype [^82cecc53]. Brain (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Alternating hemiplegia of childhood (OMIM #104290) is a rare neurodevelopmental disorder with onset before the age of 18 months and prevalence estimated at 1:1 000 000 to 1:100 000. Affected children typically survive to adulthood, and we use the label 'alternating hemiplegia'. Pathogenic mutations, almost always de novo, in the ATP1A3 gene, encoding the catalytic alpha-3 subunit of the Na + /K + -ATPase transporter protein, are the cause in ∼80% of cases. No other cause is known.

Alternating hemiplegia is characterized by recurrent transient plegic or paretic attacks, affecting alternate or both sides of the body, dystonic posturing, and oculomotor dysfunction. Seizures are common, as are non-paroxysmal features including: dystonia, choreoathetosis, ataxia, pyramidal signs, developmental delay and varying degrees of intellectual disability. Dysautonomia, manifesting as dyspnoea, stridor, apnoea, pallor, fever, and altered heart rate, is frequently described during plegic episodes. Occasionally, autonomic dysfunction can occur in isolation. Recently, asystole associated with new-onset episodes of collapse with loss of consciousness, cyanosis and respiratory arrest was reported in a patient with genetically-confirmed alternating hemiplegia, benefitting from implantation of a permanent pacemaker.

### Considerations for developing complex post-stroke upper limb behavioural interventions: an international qualitative study [^69abce82]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2024). Medium credibility.

Theme 3. Stroke demands personalised solutions

Participants in all groups considered personalisation of behavioural interventions to be essential due to the heterogeneity of post-stroke phenotypes. Participants in the preclinical group identified that variability is seen in preclinical models of stroke with similar stroke lesions (i.e. volume, size, location). They noted that such variability is likely to be more prominent in clinical populations, with more advanced brain structures and distributed neural networks.

It always has impressed me when we started making even these little focal strokes… we see a wide disparity in the way that animals react, whether it's rats, monkeys, or humans. Preclinical Research #9

Participants in the preclinical and clinical research groups suggested that those developing behavioural interventions need to consider the heterogeneity of post-stroke presentations while maintaining a firm foundation in neuroscience and human biomechanics. Supporting quotes can be found in Figure 3; additional quotes in.

Figure 3.
Theme 3: 'Stroke demands personalised solutions' overview and embedded subthemes.

Subtheme 3A. Condition-specific considerations

All groups identified that a stroke survivor's presentation may include multiple impairments that together define a behavioural phenotype (e.g. contributions from hemiparesis, abnormal muscle synergies, loss of dexterity). Participants in the preclinical research, clinical research and clinical experience groups described the need for diagnostic tools to provide deep insights into a stroke survivor's phenotype and go beyond what is possible to capture with a bedside clinical assessment. Phenotypes were discussed to be characterised by behavioural presentation (e.g. weakness) and biomarkers of neurological structures and function (e.g. residual corticospinal tract integrity). Integrating both behavioural presentation and biomarkers to define a stroke phenotype would be considered an advancement that would subsequently inform intervention decisions.

There could be no doubt that correlates of better outcome in the mild patients are not the same as the correlates in the more severe patients. There's no one solution. Clinical Research #2

Participants in the preclinical research, clinical research and clinical experience groups discussed the need to personalise interventions to consider the potential consequences of non-motor impairments to upper limb motor recovery.

### Multilevel surgery improves gait in spastic hemiplegia but does not resolve hip dysplasia [^f69dea3d]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Multilevel orthopaedic surgery may improve gait in Type IV hemiplegia, but it is not known if proximal femoral osteotomy combined with adductor release as part of multilevel surgery in patients with hip dysplasia improves hip development.

Questions/Purposes

We asked whether varus derotational osteotomy of the proximal femur, combined with adductor release, influenced hip development in patients with Type IV hemiplegia having multilevel surgery.

Patients and Methods

We retrospectively reviewed 11 children and adolescents with Type IV hemiplegia who had a proximal femoral osteotomy due to unilateral hip displacement to correct gait dysfunction between 1999 and 2006. The mean age at the time of surgery was 11.1 years (range, 7 to 16 years). We obtained the Movement Analysis Profile and Gait Profile Score before and after surgery. We also measured the Migration Percentage of Reimers and applied the Melbourne Cerebral Palsy Hip Classification System (MCPHCS). The minimum followup was 2 years 3 months (mean, 6 years 6 months; range, 2 years 3 months to 10 years 8 months).

Results

The majority of gait parameters improved but hip development was not normalized. According to the MCPHCS at last followup, no hips were classified as Grade I, two hips were classified as Grade II, and the remainder were Grade III and IV.

Conclusions

Unilateral surgery including a proximal femoral osteotomy improved gait and walking ability in individuals with spastic hemiplegic cerebral palsy. However, hip dysplasia persists.

### Faulty cardiac repolarization reserve in alternating hemiplegia of childhood broadens the phenotype [^17e88004]. Brain (2015). Low credibility.

Discussion

Alternating hemiplegia is a rare neurological disorder with significant phenotypic diversity. Known outcomes range from life into adulthood, with comparatively little disability, to premature mortality from sudden death. The broad range of presentations has typically been ascribed to neurological abnormalities, including epilepsy-related sudden death (SUDEP). Discovery of the underlying cause of most cases, de novo mutation in ATP1A3, is accelerating understanding of alternating hemiplegia. ATP1A3 expression extends beyond the brain, and includes the heart. In keeping with this expression pattern and both paroxysmal and interictal neurological dysfunction in ATP1A3 -related disease, we show common and dynamic abnormalities of cardiac physiology in alternating hemiplegia, as manifest in electrocardiographic data. Our findings have implications for the more complete understanding and management of alternating hemiplegia, and other cardiocerebral disorders, which include many epilepsies. The data also indicate the need for caution with drugs used for other symptoms or problems in people with alternating hemiplegia, as is the case, for example, with Brugada syndrome.

Overall, we show some type of ECG abnormality in just over half the cases (28/52). These abnormalities fall into three main categories: abnormal repolarization, with or without IVCD or incomplete right bundle branch block; J-wave or J-point changes; and the previously-reported single case of asystole. Repolarization abnormalities were present in 25 patients (48.1%), whereas they are seen in only 2% of healthy adults. While isolated IVCD and incomplete right bundle branch block changes can be normal findings, the prevalence in our cohort (21.2%) is much higher than published normal data [2.3% in females; 4.7% in males], particularly in children [∼1%], and much higher than the prevalence in disease controls with epilepsy. In addition, corrected QT intervals were significantly shorter in the alternating hemiplegia cohort compared to epilepsy disease controls. Short QT syndrome is a relatively recently-described cardiac channelopathy associated with a high risk of ventricular arrhythmia and sudden death, and mutations in KCNJ2 have recently been reported in patients with short QT syndrome and an autism–epilepsy phenotype. In contrast, QT prolongation (rather than shortening) has been reported in individuals with epilepsy, suggesting that if alternating hemiplegia has an effect on the QT interval, it is the opposite of that seen in people with epilepsy. These findings are intriguing, but will require more data, possibly including longitudinal data, to interpret.

### Effects of the robot-assisted gait training device plus physiotherapy in improving ambulatory functions in patients with subacute stroke with hemiplegia: an assessor-blinded, randomized controlled trial [^cfe0d2e6]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

To investigate the effects of the robot-assisted gait training (RAGT) device plus physiotherapy vs physiotherapy alone in improving ambulatory functions in patients with subacute stroke with hemiplegia.

Design

A prospective, assessor-blinded, randomized controlled trial.

Setting

Patients with subacute stroke with hemiplegia admitted at the Rehabilitation Center.

Participants

Twenty-six patients with subacute stroke with hemiplegia (N = 26).

Intervention

All patients received 30 training sessions (5 d/wk for 6 wk), which included conventional physiotherapy training (60 minutes) and ambulation training (60 minutes). In the ambulation training session, the RAGT device group received robotic training (40 minutes) and ground ambulation training (20 minutes). The control group received only ground ambulation training (60 minutes). The outcomes were assessed at the initial session and at the end of the 15 th and 30 th sessions. Comparisons within groups and between groups were conducted.

Main Outcome Measures

Primary outcome variables were the FIM-walk score and the efficacy of FIM-walk.

Results

The RAGT device group showed greater improvements from baseline than control in (1) the FIM-walk score at the end of the 15 th session (P = 0.012), (2) the efficacy of FIM-walk at the end of the 15 th session (P = 0.008), (3) walking distance in the 6-minute walk test at the end of the 15 th session (P = 0.018), (4) the Barthel Index for Activities of Daily Living (ADL) at the end of the 30 th session (P < .001), and (5) gait symmetry ratio at the end of the 30 th session (P = 0.044). Other gait parameters showed tendencies of improvement in the RAGT device group, but there were no significant differences.

Conclusions

RAGT devices plus physiotherapy showed early improvements in walking ability and Barthel ADL index compared with the ground level training plus physiotherapy in patients with subacute stroke with hemiplegia.

### The effect of an arm sling on energy consumption while walking in hemiplegic patients: a randomized comparison [^5fbcb8ec]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

In patients with hemiplegia, gait problems such as poor gait performance, reduced walking endurance and decreased functional mobility are some of the more serious disabilities. Some authors also reported that at a given speed, hemiplegic patients spend more energy per unit of distance travelled than healthy individuals do. In addition, Bohannon et al. reported that most stroke patients rank the restoration of walking in the community as one of the most important goals of rehabilitation.

Hemiplegic shoulder pain is also common after a stroke. It adversely affects the recovery of arm function and independence in the activities of daily living. Although the relationship between subluxation and hemiplegic shoulder pain remains unclear, various techniques are commonly used to correct this subluxation, including slings, and neuromuscular electric stimulation. Arm slings have various purposes, including realigning scapular symmetry, supporting the forearm in a flexed arm position, improving anatomic alignment with an auxiliary support and supporting the shoulder with a cuff. Despite some uncertainty about their efficacy and timing of use, arm slings are still the most preferred treatment modality for shoulder subluxation in patients with hemiplegia with stroke.

To our knowledge, there has been only one report about the effect of arm sling on gait of hemiplegic patients. Yavuzer and Erginreported that an arm sling improved gait pattern using kinematic and kinetic parameters, especially during gait training sessions of patients with hemiplegia who have impaired body image and excessive motion of the centre of gravity. However, no study on the impact of arm sling on energy efficiency in hemiplegia has yet been reported. On the basis of previous study, it is hypothesized that shoulder support by an arm sling improves not only gait pattern but also the energy efficiency of patients with hemiplegia. This study was designed to investigate the effect of shoulder support by an arm sling on gait speed and energy efficiency of patients with hemiplegia.

### Prescribing physical, occupational, and speech therapy services for children with disabilities [^a6af87ea]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

Pediatric rehabilitation dosing and intensity — evidence and example schedules are outlined: there is "not yet a strong evidence base to support any particular dosing strategy" except in unilateral hemiplegic cerebral palsy where high-intensity, activity-based upper extremity therapy "has been shown to improve outcomes… than standard therapy administration (such as once a week)". Therapies "can be dosed in an intense fashion, such as 45 to 60 minutes 2 or more times a week", while "a commonly delivered dose of therapy is for 30 to 60 minutes per week for an episode of care". Young children "do well with shorter duration of therapy per session" and may need more total sessions or breaks, and children with new-onset disabilities after injury may need early intense services followed by a less intense schedule. The commonly delivered weekly schedule "is often used when a child exhibits continued progress toward goals and is at risk for a lack of progress or regression if therapy services were halted".

### Development of hand-arm bimanual intensive training (HABIT) for improving bimanual coordination in children with hemiplegic cerebral palsy [^3b466db2]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2006). Low credibility.

Constraint-induced (CI) movement therapy is a physical intervention that has been receiving increasing attention in pediatric rehabilitation. So far, the evidence suggests that practice associated with CI therapy may improve impaired unimanual hand function in some children with hemiplegic cerebral palsy (CP). However, CI therapy has several important limitations. Most importantly, children with hemiplegia have impairments in bimanual coordination beyond their unilateral impairments. Thus, an intervention approach to increase functional independence during activities of daily living by using both hands in cooperation is needed. Here we briefly review the etiology of hemiplegic CP, describe studies of pediatric CI therapy efficacy in relation to the etiology, discuss the conceptual and practical limitations of CI therapy for this population, and describe bimanual coordination impairments in children with hemiplegia. Finally, we introduce a new intervention for children with hemiplegia, hand-arm bimanual intensive training (HABIT), to address the limitations of CI therapy and to improve bimanual coordination. HABIT retains the two major elements of pediatric CI therapy (intensive structured practice and child-friendliness). The proposed methodology demonstrates that extensive targeted practice can be provided in a child-friendly manner without using a physical restraint, although the efficacy of such an approach remains to be determined.

### Proof-of-concept randomized trial of the monoclonal antibody GSK249320 versus placebo in stroke patients [^bd8d4364]. Stroke (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

The current study hypothesized that GSK249320, administered as 2 IV infusions beginning 24 to 72 hours poststroke and spaced 5 ± 2 days apart, would improve gait recovery over 90 days in subjects with ischemic stroke and leg weakness with impaired walking ability. The data do not support this, and the study was stopped at interim analysis because observed difference between treatment groups met the predefined futility threshold.

The primary outcome measure was gait velocity, a choice that in retrospect had both advantages and disadvantages. Gait velocity has an established record as a valid, reliable assessment sensitive to treatment effects. Another advantage is that it measures function (ie, disability and activities limitations), rather than impairment, and can be directly linked with participation level (ie, handicap). As a modality-specific outcome measure, gait velocity has potential advantages compared with global outcomes for understanding recovery such as granularity of assessment. Furthermore, reduced gait velocity is common after stroke, gait improvements after stroke are linked to better quality of life, and in some studies gait recovery is ranked as the top priority by patients with hemiplegia after stroke. The value of gait velocity as primary end point was also based in part on its direct link with entry criteria (Table 1), which required slow gait for study entry. However, at baseline, > 80% of subjects were entirely unable to ambulate at all (gait velocity = 0 m/s), masking accurate understanding of within-subject gait recovery. This produced a floor effect such that several different degrees of neural abnormality were scored identically, although the study did make the key distinction between patients with gait velocity = 0 m/s and patients in whom gait velocity could not be assessed. Another potential disadvantage of gait as the primary end point is that it is a complex behavior influenced by activity at multiple nervous system levels. Many patients with severe hemiparesis learn to walk on their spasticity, further complicating interpretation of changes in gait velocity after stroke. Putting it in perspective, the current placebo group mean gait velocity change from baseline to day 90 (0.56 m/s) was > 3-fold greater compared with placebo group of the previous phase II GSK249320 trial (0.18 m/s), a difference possibly because of play of chance but that reduced ability of the current study to detect a treatment group difference. Level of impairment also differed between studies, with median placebo group baseline total NIHSS score of 7 in the previous trial compared with 9.5 herein.

### Bilateral effect of acupuncture on cerebrum and cerebellum in ischaemic stroke patients with hemiparesis: a randomised clinical and neuroimaging trial [^fbe94b1b]. Stroke and Vascular Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

The main objectives of the codesigned study were to assess the specific effects of acupuncture involving the bilateral limbs compared with non-acupoint (NA) acupuncture for unilateral-lesion ischaemic stroke (IS) patients and increase the relevance of clinical and neuroimaging outcomes. We hypothesised there would be pathological characteristics for unilateral-lesion IS, on which acupuncture could take effect to improve motor function and modify the static and dynamic functional connectivities bilaterally.

### Classification of spastic hemiplegic cerebral palsy in children [^69d77362]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2007). Low credibility.

Background

The Winter classification of spastic hemiplegic cerebral palsy (CP) is based on sagittal kinematic data from 3-dimensional gait analysis used in preoperative decision making and postoperative evaluation. Our goal was to investigate how well children with spastic hemiplegic CP can be classified using Winter criteria. Second, we assessed if patients move between groups over time and/or with surgical intervention.

Methods

One hundred twelve patients with spastic hemiplegic CP with a mean age of 8.1 years were included. Medical records and the full gait analysis data were reviewed. Patients were classified using Winter criteria, and an independent sample t test was used to compare groups.

Results

We found 26 patients (23%) that could not be classified according to Winter criteria. We defined these patients as group 0. This group showed the least deviation from normal values. Each of the 5 groups in our study showed a higher mean velocity of gait and were younger than any of the groups from the Winter study. In regard to rotational alignment, kinetic variables, and, to a certain extent, muscle tone, group 0 showed the least deviation from normal values; however, most differences were subtle. When reclassifying patients after a mean of 3 years, 8 of 15 had deteriorated in the nonsurgical group, moving to a higher numbered group, whereas 19 of 31 surgically treated patients had improved.

Conclusions

The Winter classification failed to classify 23% (26/112) of our spastic hemiplegic CP children. We suggest that the classification be complemented with the less involved group 0. In this way, all patients can be classified, and thus, treatment plans can be established for all patients. The classification can be divided into ankle, knee, and hip joint involvement. The ankle involvement can be further divided into 3 separate groups. Treating physicians should be aware of the possibility that patients may move into another classification group over time.

### Providing a primary care medical home for children and youth with cerebral palsy [^5b073612]. Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

Topography terminology in CP — topography refers to the parts of the body affected and may be unilateral or bilateral, yielding hemiplegic, quadriplegia, diplegia, or triplegia patterns. "Hemiplegic" CP indicates predominantly unilateral involvement; bilateral symptoms may be described as quadriplegia if all 4 limbs are affected, diplegia if the legs are predominantly affected, or triplegia if there is relative sparing of 1 arm. Topography alone does not predict function; some children with quadriplegia may be able to ambulate and some with diplegia may not.

### Bone age in children with hemiplegic cerebral palsy [^8abae542]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2003). Low credibility.

Children with hemiplegic cerebral palsy may develop differences in limb length; when severe, limb length equalization may be recommended. Serial bone ages are necessary to predict when to perform equalization procedures. By convention, the left hand is always used to determine bone age. There is little information regarding the effect of hemiplegia on bone age. It was postulated that children with left hemiplegia will show a delay in bone age compared with those with right hemiplegia, and it was the purpose of this study to review this question. A retrospective review of 38 children (27 boys, 11 girls) with hemiplegic cerebral palsy between 1980 and 2000 was performed. The hemiplegia involved the right side in 21 and the left side in 17. The hand-wrist bone age was determined by one observer using the Greulich and Pyle atlas. The paired t test was used to analyze for differences between bone age and chronologic age. There was no difference between the average chronologic age (12.0 ± 3.5 years) and average bone age (12.0 ± 3.7 years) (P = 0.83). There was no difference between the chronologic and bone age for either those with right hemiplegia (P = 0.65) or left hemiplegia (P = 0.87). It is not necessary to obtain radiographs of both hands in children with hemiplegia during routine monitoring of limb length discrepancies.

### Arm use after left or right hemiparesis is influenced by hand preference [^57acaf8e]. Stroke (2009). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Despite strong evidence for hand preference and its impact on motor performance, its influence on stroke rehabilitation has not been routinely considered. Previous research demonstrates that patients with hemiparetic stroke use their ipsilesional, nonparetic arm 5 to 6 times more frequently than their paretic arm, but it is unknown if such use varies with laterality of hemiparesis. The purpose of our study was to determine if the right arm is used more frequently in right-handed patients with stroke.

Methods

We assessed relative use of the right, left, and both arms with wrist accelerometers on patients with unilateral, paretic stroke matched for degree of paresis (12 with right hemisphere damage, 17 with left hemisphere damage) and 25 neurologically intact control participants as they performed the Arm Motor Ability Test.

Results

We showed: (1) ipsilesional arm use was greater after right hemisphere damage than left hemisphere damage; (2) the left hemisphere damage group used both arms together more often than the right hemisphere damage group but less often than the control group; and (3) both stroke groups used their contralesional, paretic arm to the same degree.

Conclusions

These findings emphasize the influence of hand preference on arm use after stroke for the ipsilesional but not the contralesional arm. Although both stroke groups used their ipsilesional more than their contralesional arm, the difference was greater for the right hemisphere damage group who used their ipsilesional arm 4 times more frequently than their contralesional arm, whereas the left hemisphere damage group used their ipsilesional arm 2 times more frequently than their contralesional arm.

### Mirror therapy in children with hemiplegia… [^b16c4f33]. isrctn.com (2025). Medium credibility.

Background and study aims Spastic hemiplegia, a neuromuscular condition of spasticity that results in the muscles on one side of the body being in a constant state of contraction, in childhood is a disabling motor condition occurring during prenatal, perinatal or infant brain development. or acquired cerebral damage during later childhood. It is one of the most frequent motor disorders of childhood with a prevalence estimated at 1 in 1000 children. Upper limb difficulties often predominate, affecting function and skill and grace in physical movement especially of hands, limiting motor independence in activities of daily life. Mirror therapy is a new approach aiming to improve upper limb motor function in hemiplegia. In MT patients train by looking into a mirror placed along their midline and hiding their defective limb.

The observed reflection of the normally functioning limb superimposes itself on the defective one, thus generating the visual illusion of a limb that functions normally. Hemiparesis following adult stroke was confirmed to be improved by mirror therapy in four recent clinical trials. MT is easy to apply, inexpensive, non invasive and as such may be considered an interesting additional treatment to the rehabilitation of children with hemiplegia. The aim of this study is to determine the efficacy of MT in children. with hemiplegia and provide further evidence regarding this approach, by conducting a study in 100 children with hemiplegia. Who can participate. Children and teenagers with hemiplegia aged 7 to 16 years old. What does the study involve. The 100 participants will be randomly assigned to one of two groups. All of the. systematic sequence of activities.

They will be instructed to focus their visual attention on the side of the paretic hand during the training. The first group will perform this training using a mirror box which will be placed at a 70 to 80° angle to the child hiding the paretic limb, therefore providing the mirror feedback of a normally functioning affected hand. The second group will perform the same bimanual training without a mirror, under direct visual control of both hands.

### Comparisons of right and left hemiparetic cerebral palsy [^18734658]. Pediatric Neurology (2004). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to compare right and left hemiparetic cerebral palsy. Sixty children (34 males, 26 females) with hemiparetic cerebral palsy were recruited. Thirty-two children manifested left hemiparetic cerebral palsy and 28 right hemiparetic cerebral palsy. Low birth weight, seizures, a family history of epilepsy, severity of cerebral palsy, and computed tomographic findings were analyzed. No significant differences were found between the clinical patterns of hemiparesis in both groups. Gestational history, low birth weight, and perinatal pathologies were present in similar percentages in the left and the right hemiparetic cerebral palsy children. Significantly greater numbers of pregnancies (P = 0.003) and deliveries (P = 0.01) were observed in the left hemiparetic cerebral palsy group as compared with the right hemiparetic cerebral palsy group. Similarly, significantly (P = 0.03) lower values of the Apgar score were recorded in the left hemiparetic cerebral palsy group than the right hemiparetic cerebral palsy group. A similar percentage of neuroradiologic abnormalities was detected in both groups. Twenty-six (43.3%) children with hemiparetic cerebral palsy had epilepsy. The incidence of intractable epilepsy was similar in both groups. The results of this study are comparable with earlier reports on hemiparetic cerebral palsy.

### Electrophysiological study of hemiplegia… [^afa80c42]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

- Motor nerve conduction velocities of the ulnar and common peroneal but not the median nerves were substantially reduced in the affected limbs in a series of hemiplegic patients. Slowing of conduction velocity of the common peroneal nerve was related to the reduction of skin temperature in the hemiplegic limbs. Brachial plexus latencies to biceps and deltoid muscles were longer in the affected than in the unaffected sides in five of 12 hemiplegic patients. Electromyograms of limb muscles showed absence of spontaneous activity in 83% of patients. Spontaneous EMG activities in 12 of the 13 patients were related to an associated subclinical neuropathy or plexopathy in the involved limbs.

### Is the early diagnosis of pediatric stroke possible in the emergency department? [^27a13a70]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Background and Purpose

Pediatric stroke is a neurological emergency. Knowing the predictive clinical markers for childhood stroke will help in early diagnosis and patient management. This study aims to (1) evaluate patients admitted to the pediatric emergency department (PED) with acute neurological signs and/or symptoms who underwent neuroimaging and (2) determine the clinical warning signs for the early recognition of stroke.

Methods

One hundred one patients aged 1 month to 18 years who were admitted with stroke-related neurological signs and symptoms and underwent neuroimaging in the PED were retrospectively analyzed using the file record system. As a result of these imaging tests, the characteristics of patients with stroke and nonstroke were compared.

Results

The mean age of the 92 included patients was 10.7 (SD, 4.5) years. Among the admission symptoms of the patients, a significant difference was observed only in terms of speech disorder, whereas a significant difference was found in the examination results for altered consciousness and dysarthria. The incidences of hemiplegia and hemiparesis were higher in the stroke group, but they were not statistically significant. The median duration of time from symptom onset to PED admission was 240 minutes (interquartile range, 30–1440 minutes). The mean time from PED admission to magnetic resonance imaging in the stroke group was 2.3 (SD, 0.7) hours, which was significantly shorter than for the nonstroke group (4.9 [SD, 1.2] hours, P = 0.002).

Conclusions

Childhood stroke is a neurological emergency that requires a multidisciplinary approach. Early stroke diagnosis is vital for treatment and prognosis. With respect to sudden neurological deficits, particularly dysarthria, altered consciousness, hemiplegia, and hemiparesis, should alert clinicians to stroke. In addition, interdepartmental cooperation is essential both in the rapid recognition of stroke and the treatment and follow-up processes.

### Abusive head trauma in infants and children: technical report [^daadfe0b]. Pediatrics (2025). High credibility.

Abusive head trauma (AHT) — motor outcomes: AHT may cause persistent motor complications including hemiplegia, quadriplegia, and/or fine motor deficits, with long-term motor outcomes measured at 5 or more years and fine and gross motor difficulties reported in between 25% and 60% of patients; gross motor impairments are primarily spastic hemi- or quadriplegia and these children require ongoing care with pediatric rehabilitation specialists. Factors that predict higher likelihood of long-term disability include severity of the initial presentation, extent of injury, and lower socioeconomic status, and multiple studies have found disability incidence or severity was worse at longer follow-up; therefore, long-term longitudinal care of all children after AHT is important, even for patients with initial good recovery.

### Mentalizing the body: spatial and social cognition in anosognosia for hemiplegia [^27c3e91c]. Brain (2016). Low credibility.

Individual patient analyses

However, there were also statistically significant differences between the two control groups (i.e. the hemiplegia group may also show a deficit in third person perspective taking based on the same definition) and it was not possible to determine at the above group level whether patients with AHP show a 'differential deficit', or otherwise known, 'classical dissociation' (seefor definitions) between the first person and third person perspective taking conditions, in relation to the hemiplegia group. Thus, we also conducted analysis at the individual level.

Specifically, using the Revised Standardized Difference Test (RSDT), we examined whether each patient with AHP, or with hemiplegia showed a deficit in third but not in first person conditions as compared with the performance of the healthy controls on these respective tasks, and whether this patient's scores in the two tasks differed between them at statistically significant levels (the three criteria of a classical dissociation). These comparisons would allow us to establish how many patients in AHP and separately in the hemiplegia group showed a deficit and a differential deficit, or classical dissociation in third person perspective taking in relation to healthy controls. However, to further establish the specificity of this deficit in relation to AHP, we also needed to examine the severity (not just the incidence; see 'Materials and methods' section for definitions) of these deficits and differential deficits in the AHP group in relation to the hemiplegia group. To this end, we applied the same method on the comparison between each AHP patient with the performance of the hemiplegia controls on the two perspective conditions (Supplementary Tables 1 and Supplementary Data).

### International consensus definitions for infection-triggered encephalopathy syndromes [^b2efb13d]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Aim

To develop standardized diagnostic criteria for 'infection-triggered encephalopathy syndrome (ITES)' and five specific clinical syndromes of ITES.

Method

The draft definitions were based on existing criteria, standardized, and discussed by a panel of international experts using nominal group technique over 18months to achieve consensus. All criteria use the same format: (1) presence of infection/fever; (2) clinical features including encephalopathy; (3) neuroradiological features on magnetic resonance imaging; (4) exclusion of other causes.

Results

We first highlighted differences between ITES and infectious and autoimmune encephalitis, which is the most important differential diagnosis. Consensus was achieved to define five specific ITESs: acute encephalopathy with biphasic seizures and late reduced diffusion; acute necrotizing encephalopathy; mild encephalopathy with a reversible splenial lesion; acute fulminant cerebral oedema; and acute shock with encephalopathy and multiorgan failure. Two further conditions that are currently classified as epilepsy syndromes but have similar features to ITES, namely febrile infection-related epilepsy syndrome and hemiconvulsion-hemiplegia-epilepsy syndrome, are also discussed.

Interpretation

The consensus definition is expected to improve awareness of this disease concept, provide diagnostic framework, and facilitate future international research and clinical trials.

### Deficits in upper-limb task performance in children with hemiplegic cerebral palsy as defined by 3-dimensional kinematics [^d16be299]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To define upper-limb movement deficits in children with hemiplegia using 3-dimensional (3-D) kinematic analysis of functional tasks.

Design

Cohort study.

Setting

University gait laboratory.

Participants

Ten children with hemiplegic cerebral palsy (mean age, 13.3y; range, 10-17y) and 10 control children (mean age, 9.8y; range, 6-12y).

Interventions

Not applicable.

Main Outcome Measure

3-D upper-limb movement analysis.

Results

3-D kinematics detected clinically significant between-group differences. Children with hemiplegia were significantly slower than control children in time taken to complete tasks (P < .05) and achieved slower movement velocities (P < .05). Group differences in range of motion (ROM) occurred in all 3 tasks examined (hand to mouth, hand to head, reach). Children with hemiplegia had significantly less supination (P < .03) and shoulder flexion (P < .03) and increased compensatory trunk flexion (P < .01) compared with control data (hand-to-mouth task). The reach task highlighted restriction of elbow extension in children with hemiplegia (minimum elbow extension: hemiplegia, 24 ± 18 degrees; control, 3 ± 7 degrees). Completing tasks bilaterally did not alter performance of the tasks in children with hemiplegia.

Conclusions

3-D kinematics detected deficits in timing, ROM, and proximal compensatory strategies during upper-limb functional task performance in children with hemiplegia.

### Development of hand function during the first year of life in children with unilateral cerebral palsy [^259c5fc4]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Aim

To identify developmental trajectories of hand function in infants aged 3 months to 12 months with unilateral cerebral palsy (CP).

Method

Infants at high risk of unilateral CP were recruited from 3 months of age from follow-up programmes and clinics in Sweden, the Netherlands, Italy, and Australia. Measurements on the Hand Assessment for Infants (HAI) were completed until 12 months of age. Group-based trajectory modelling was used to identify subgroups of infants with similar trajectories of development. Multinomial logistic regression determined associations between demographic variables and trajectory membership.

Results

Ninety-seven infants (52 males, 45 females; median gestational age 38wks [interquartile range 30-40wks]) were included. Infants were assessed between two and seven times (mean 4, SD 1.2) with a total of 387 observations. A three-group trajectory model identified a 'low-functioning group' (n = 45: 46%), 'moderate-functioning group' (n = 30: 31%), and 'high-functioning group' (n = 22: 23%). Mean posterior probabilities (0.91–0.96) and odds of correct classification (26.3–33.2) indicated good model fit. Type of brain lesion, sex, side of hemiplegia, country, gestational age, and access to intensive intervention were not associated with group membership.

Interpretation

Three trajectories of hand function development for infants with unilateral CP were identified and indicate some greater distinctions between groups with increasing age. The HAI is a valuable measure, capturing development of hand function of infants with unilateral CP over time.

What This Paper Adds

Three distinct developmental trajectories of hand function in infants with unilateral cerebral palsy were identified. A low-functioning group made little progress in development of hand function in the first year of life. The degree of impairment on the impaired hand at 6 months of age is highly associated with trajectory membership. Infants with all types of brain lesion were represented across each trajectory group.

### Corrective brace for the upper extremity in hemiplegia… [^0f564940]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

This article is only available in the PDF format. Download the PDF to view the article, as well as its associated figures and tables. In the first few days after the occurrence of hemiplegia, the affected upper extremity is limp and appears flaccid, but actually, the muscles are spastic. After a variable short time a typical position is assumed. The upper extremity is adducted, the elbow flexed, the forearm pronated, and the wrist, fingers, and thumb flexed. If physical therapy and rehabilitation measures are not begun early, permanent contractures of muscles develop, and the upper extremity becomes fixed in the position described. There is a slow improvement in the brain tissue because of a partial resolution of the lesion. This results in improvement in the potential motor ability of the cortex.

Unfortunately, this organic improvement of brain tissue cannot be translated into purposeful volitional movements, because the muscles and joints of the upper extremity have been fixed by contractures. Many patients with hemiplegia of long duration have an increased potential ability to execute volitional Rudin LN, Cronin DJ, Croucher JS. CORRECTIVE BRACE FOR THE UPPER EXTREMITY IN HEMIPLEGIA.

### Nerve stimulation enhances task-oriented training in chronic, severe motor deficit after stroke: a randomized trial [^e8ae381a]. Stroke (2016). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

A sensory-based intervention called peripheral nerve stimulation can enhance outcomes of motor training for stroke survivors with mild-to-moderate hemiparesis. Further research is needed to establish whether this paired intervention can have benefit in cases of severe impairment (almost no active movement).

Methods

Subjects with chronic, severe poststroke hemiparesis (n = 36) were randomized to receive 10 daily sessions of either active or sham stimulation (2 hours) immediately preceding intensive task-oriented training (4 hours). Upper extremity movement function was assessed using Fugl-Meyer Assessment (primary outcome measure), Wolf Motor Function Test, and Action Research Arm Test at baseline, immediately post intervention and at 1-month follow-up.

Results

Statistically significant difference between groups favored the active stimulation group on Fugl-Meyer at postintervention (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.1–6.9; P = 0.008) and 1-month follow-up (95% CI, 0.6–8.3; P = 0.025), Wolf Motor Function Test at postintervention (95% CI, -0.21 to -0.02; P = 0.020), and Action Research Arm Test at postintervention (95% CI, 0.8–7.3; P = 0.015) and 1-month follow-up (95% CI, 0.6–8.4; P = 0.025). Only the active stimulation condition was associated with (1) statistically significant within-group benefit on all outcomes at 1-month follow-up and (2) improvement exceeding minimal detectable change, as well as minimal clinically significant difference, on ≥ 1 outcomes at ≥ 1 time points after intervention.

Conclusions

After stroke, active peripheral nerve stimulation paired with intensive task-oriented training can effect significant improvement in severely impaired upper extremity movement function. Further confirmatory studies that consider a larger group, as well as longer follow-up, are needed.

### What are the functional outcomes of right hemisphere stroke patients with or without hemi-inattention complications? A critical narrative review and suggestions for further research [^3eb000c1]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2016). Low credibility.

Table 1.
Critical evaluation of reviewed studies (abbreviations are defined in Appendix 2).

On the GRADE scale; A is high and assigned to well-performed Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies with consistent results and/or strong effects. B is moderate – serious flaws in the design in which the estimated effect is likely to be considerably different than the true effect. C is low – studies with serious limitations in which the true effect is likely to be very different than the estimated, e.g. failure to include relevant confounding factors. D is very low – as in C but any estimated effect is very uncertain and highly unlikely to reflect the true effect.

### Management of stroke in neonates and children: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^eef32840]. Stroke (2019). High credibility.

Childhood acute stroke — clinical presentation frequencies indicate that the most common symptoms include hemiparesis and hemifacial weakness in 67% to 90%, speech or language disturbance in 20% to 50%, vision disturbance in 10% to 15%, and ataxia in 8% to 10%; children also present with headache in 20% to 50% and altered mental status in 17% to 38%, and seizures at stroke onset affect 15% to 25%, especially in those < 6 years of age, with presentation varying by age, setting (inpatient versus emergency department [ED]), and stroke subtype.

### Botulinum toxin type A injections in the spastic upper extremity of children with hemiplegia: child characteristics that predict a positive outcome [^9ba26cdb]. European Journal of Neurology (2001). Low credibility.

Evidence is increasing to suggest that botulinum toxin type A (BTX-A) plays a role in the management of upper extremity spasticity in the paediatric population. However, little information is available on the clinical characteristics of the child that predict a response to this intervention. Our research group previously published a randomized controlled trial demonstrating that BTX-A injection improves function of the upper extremity of children with spastic hemiplegia. In the present paper, we evaluate the child characteristics that predict a positive response to the BTX-A injections in the randomized treatment group. The treatment group was divided into positive functional responders and nonresponders using a cut score of a change of 10 points on the Quality of Upper Extremity Skills Test (QUEST). A two-way analysis of variance procedure was done comparing the following baseline characteristics: function as scored on the QUEST and the Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory (PEDI) self-care domain, grip strength, upper extremity spasticity and age. Grip strength was significantly higher in responders with a P-value of 0.001. Young age approached significance with a P-value of 0.05. Correlation of change scores on the QUEST with baseline characteristics in the treatment group yielded similar results. BTX-A causes a reduction in spasticity and strength; we postulate that if the hand is weak initially, BTX-A can decrease hand function. Two case reports are presented that highlight the importance of grip strength and age.

### Pediatric stroke: do clinical factors predict delays in presentation? [^284381d6]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

To explore associations between age, clinical presentation, or predisposing conditions and delayed diagnosis of arterial ischemic stroke.

Study Design

This was a retrospective chart review of children admitted to tertiary care medical centers in San Diego County between 1995 and 2000. Inpatient charts were screened by ICD-9 codes for stroke, cerebrovascular anomalies, hemiplegia, and migraine.

Results

Time of presentation for medical evaluation did not differ by age group, clinical presentation, or risk factors. There was no relationship between time of presentation and Glasgow Outcome Score. Only 24% (9/37) of the patients with ischemic stroke presented for clinical evaluation within 6 hours after onset of symptoms, and an additional 41% (13/37) presented within the first 24 hours. Children who initially presented with altered mental status were more likely to die than those with other initial presentations (odds ratio = 9.94; 95% confidence interval = 2.05 to 47.9), but none of the 16 children who presented with hemiparesis died (P = 0.01).

Conclusion

Time of presentation was not related to the clinical factors studied. Early recognition of stroke in children is an important goal for families and health care providers.

### Bi-hemispheric transcranial direct current stimulation for upper-limb hemiparesis in acute stroke: a randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled trial [^8ba74976]. European Journal of Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background and Purpose

Neuromodulation is a promising approach to increasing motor recovery in stroke; however, to date, there is a scarcity of evidence documenting the clinical potential of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) administered in the acute phase of stroke. The present study aims to examine the clinical effects of a treatment involving the application of tDCS in the acute stage post-stroke.

Methods

This was a randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled trial. A cohort of 32 stroke patients with severe motor impairment underwent 5 days of treatment with real or sham bi-hemispheric tDCS over the motor cortex. During the treatment, tDCS was applied twice per day (two daily applications each of 15 min), starting 48 to 72 h after stroke onset.

Results

We found statistically significant improvements after both real and sham tDCS treatments in primary (hand grip strength, Motricity Index) and secondary (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score, Barthel Index) outcomes. Patients receiving real tDCS showed a larger improvement of upper-limb muscle strength at the end of treatment phase; this advantage was no longer present after 6 months.

Conclusions

Transcranial direct current stimulation may be used to accelerate the rate of upper-limb motor recovery during the spontaneous recovery period.

### Comparing the characteristics of randomized controlled trials of poststroke upper extremity rehabilitation in low-middle-income and high-income countries [^78a504fe]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

This review aimed to systematically identify and compare randomized controlled trials of poststroke upper extremity rehabilitation interventions conducted in low-middle-income countries and high-income countries over time and their differences in study characteristics and quality. Searches were conducted in CINAHL, Embase, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science up to April 1, 2021. Randomized controlled trials were included if ≥ 50% of the study population had stroke, if participants were adults (≥ 18 yrs), and if the randomized controlled trial examined an intervention to the hemiparetic upper extremity. A total of 1276 randomized controlled trials met inclusion criteria, and of these, 978 randomized controlled trials were conducted in high-income countries and 298 in low-middle-income countries. The number of randomized controlled trials increased at a comparable rate to high-income countries since 2011 although from a lower baseline. A higher percentage of randomized controlled trials in high-income countries were conducted in the chronic poststroke phase, and a higher percentage of randomized controlled trials in low-middle-income countries were conducted in the subacute phase. While the randomized controlled trials in low-middle-income countries were found to have comparable quality to randomized controlled trials of high-income countries, they were published in aggregate in journals with lower impact factors. It is important to better understand the potential barriers to publication in higher impact journals for randomized controlled trials conducted in low-middle-income countries.

### Impairment severity selectively affects the control of proximal and distal components of reaching movements in children with hemiplegic cerebral palsy [^348ba8e9]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2009). Low credibility.

This study explored proximal-to-distal components during goal-directed reaching movements in children with mild or moderate hemiplegic cerebral palsy (HCP); [seven females, four males; mean age 8 y 6 mo; SD 27 mo], compared with age-matched, typically developing children (seven females, five males; mean age 8 y 3 mo [SD 25 mo]. Severity of HCP was assessed following the approach of Claeys et al. Optoelectronic registrations were made during unimanual reaching-to-grasp and reaching-to-hit movements with both the affected/non-preferred and unaffected/preferred side. Regardless of task, the children with HCP, particularly those with moderate impairment, displayed less optimal spatiotemporal organization of movements performed with the affected arm. Compared with the goal to hit, and increasingly with more severe impairment, children with HCP adapted to the goal to grasp by recruiting augmented shoulder movements when reaching with the affected side. A resulting impact on distal kinematics was found in shorter, straighter, and less segmented movement paths. Thus, depending on severity of hemispheric lesions and task complexity, unilateral brain injuries in HCP may selectively affect neural pathways underlying both proximal and distal arm movement control. Levels of both ipsi- and contralateral activation in relation to side and lesion severity should be considered in future studies on prehension movements in HCP.

### Socioeconomic status influences functional severity of untreated cerebral palsy in Nepal: a prospective analysis and systematic review [^2e73b6cb]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Cerebral palsy (CP) comprises a heterogeneous group of disorders whose clinical manifestations and epidemiologic characteristics vary across socioeconomic and geographic contexts. The functional severity of untreated CP in low-income countries has been insufficiently studied; a better understanding of how these children present for care in resource-constrained environments is important because it will better characterize the natural history of CP, guide clinical decision-making, and aid in the prognostication of children with untreated CP.

Questions/Purposes

The purposes of this study were (1) to determine the etiologies, motor subtypes, topographic distributions, and functional classifications of a large cohort of Nepali children with untreated CP presenting to a large pediatric rehabilitation center in Nepal; and (2) to compare the Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS), the Manual Ability Classification System (MACS), and the Communication Function Classification System (CFCS) scores of a subset of patients with spastic CP in the Nepali cohort with control subjects from high-income countries.

Methods

A cross-sectional study was conducted at the Hospital and Rehabilitation Centre for Disabled Children in Nepal. Two hundred six consecutive Nepali children (76 girls; median age 4.0 years [interquartile range {IQR}, 2.5–9.0 years]) were evaluated to determine the demographic, clinical, and functional characteristics of a cohort of Nepali children with untreated CP. A systematic review of the Medline and Cochrane databases was then performed to obtain reference classification scores from high-income countries. Cross-sectional, noninterventional studies reporting at least one functional classification system with a sample size of at least 50 participants were included. Only studies of patients with spastic CP were included to allow for compatible comparisons with a subset of our study sample with spastic CP. A random-effects analysis was used to pool functional scores from participants in the included studies. Among the 206 children in our sample, 102 had spastic CP (35 girls; median age 5.5 years [IQR, 3.5–9.0 years]). Functional scores from these children were compared with pooled scores obtained from the systematic review by assessing the proportions of children in each sample with GMFCS, MACS, and CFCS score categories of I or II versus III to V.

Results

Children with spastic hemiplegia from high-income countries were more likely to have a GMFCS score of I or II (96% [95% confidence interval {CI}, 92%-99%] versus 78% [95% CI, 62%-89%]) and a MACS score of I or II (83% [95% CI, 77%-88%] versus 50% [95% CI, 32%-68%]) relative to those from Nepal, but they were less likely to have a CFCS score of I or II (67% [95% CI, 51%-80%] versus 97% [95% CI, 87%-99%]). No differences were seen in children with spastic diplegia or quadriplegia.

Conclusions

Children in Nepal with hemiplegic CP display less difficulty in communicating and social engagement (CFCS) despite more-severe upper- and lower-extremity impairments in gross motor function (GMFCS) and manual ability (MACS) than do children with hemiplegic CP from high-income countries. Targeted interventions, including perhaps simple orthopaedic interventions to treat soft-tissue contractures, may therefore provide more-substantial improvements in function and quality of life to Nepali children than could be achieved for the same deployment of resources in more-affluent settings.

### Conceptualisation and development of the arm activity measure (armA) for assessment of activity in the hemiparetic arm [^82a246b5]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2013). Low credibility.

Results

The results for reduction of items using modified Delphi technique at Stage 1 and the confirmation and pilot testing of ArmA at Stage 2 are presented.

Stage 1 – Delphi consultation

All 10 clinicians initially approached returned the round one consultation document. Following round 1, 48 active function items were excluded and four passive function items from the initial total of 75 items. Consensus for exclusion was between 60% and 100% (6–10 clinicians). Table 1 presents the initial short list of items following round 1.

Table 1.
Initial short list of passive and active function items (round 1), mapped back onto the systematic review measures why?

The table also shows the measures from which the items originate or identifies that they were patient selected and the broad anatomical region of the arm addressed by each item. During round 1, a passive function item, "Cleaning around the elbow" was removed. This item was removed on the recommendation of eight members of the consultation group (80%), because it was identified as not being relevant for many patients.

All 10 clinicians again returned the round 2 consultation document. A further six active function items were removed following round 2. Consensus was between 60% and 80% (6–8 clinicians) for the removal of these items. Items not in bold in Table 1 were removed.

All 10 clinicians returned the final round three-consultation document. No further items were excluded and there was between 80% and 100% (8–10 clinicians) consensus for the inclusion of the items chosen. One item which had initially been removed; "use a key to unlock the door" was re-inserted with the agreement of 80% (8/10 of clinicians (see Table 1, item marked with "+").

### Hemiplegic cerebral palsy: clinical features associated with arterial ischemic stroke or periventricular venous infarction [^8823b919]. Journal of Child Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

ObjectiveWe sought to determine the clinical features of hemiplegic cerebral palsy associated with perinatal arterial ischemic stroke or periventricular venous infarction. MethodsWe studied children with hemiplegic cerebral palsy enrolled at 9 rehabilitation centers across Ontario. We compared children with underlying perinatal arterial ischemic stroke or periventricular venous infarction on clinically acquired brain imaging. Analysis also included prenatal (maternal, prenatal/gestational) and perinatal (obstetrical, neonatal) clinical features collected from birth records and standardized parent interviews. ResultsThe 144 children with hemiplegic cerebral palsy (62% male) included 95 with perinatal arterial ischemic stroke and 49 with periventricular venous infarction. In this cohort of children with hemiplegic cerebral palsy, we found neonatal systemic thrombosis (ie, blood clots in the body) (P = 0.05), emergency cesarean section (P = 0.05), and neonatal seizures (P = 0.01) to be clinical features associated with hemiplegic cerebral palsy in children with perinatal arterial ischemic stroke more often than periventricular venous infarction. Preterm delivery rates were similar for perinatal arterial ischemic stroke and periventricular venous infarction. ConclusionWe determined clinical features associated with the 2 most typical forms of focal ischemic brain injury in children with hemiplegic cerebral palsy, including mode of delivery emergency cesarean section, neonatal seizures and systemic thrombosis. These findings provide further insight and support for existing findings about focal brain injury patterns leading to hemiplegic cerebral palsy in children.

### Mentalizing the body: spatial and social cognition in anosognosia for hemiplegia [^6bf05c48]. Brain (2016). Low credibility.

We found that the incidence of first person deficits in the AHP and hemiplegia groups was low and comparable (2 and 1 of 15 patients, respectively, showed deficits in comparison to healthy controls), while 15 AHP and 10 hemiplegia patients showed deficits in third person perspective in comparison to healthy controls. All 15 patients with AHP showed 'differential deficits' in third person versus first person perspective when compared with healthy controls, while 10 of the hemiplegia patients showed such differential deficits.

When comparing between the two patient groups to examine severity of deficits, only eight patients with AHP showed a third person perspective deficit in comparison to hemiplegia controls, while only two patients with AHP showed a first person deficit and there were no differential deficits, although several patients' scores showed trends towards significance. Taken together these results suggest that there is a higher incidence of third person visuospatial perspective taking 'deficits' and 'differential deficits' in patients with than without AHP, but that the severity of such deficits seem comparable between the two groups and there is no evidence of classical dissociation between groups.

Control condition and comprehension ratings

All participants performed close to the ceiling level for physical control stories (AHP: 97.5%; Hemiplegia: 98.33% and Healthy controls: 99.65%). There was no significant difference between groups [H (2) = 4.96, P = 0.1, r = 0.1]. All participants reported comprehension ratings between 4 and 5 (maximum score = 5, full comprehension).
