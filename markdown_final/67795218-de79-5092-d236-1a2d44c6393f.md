## Question

The student council sells scented erasers in the morning before school starts to help raise money for school dances. The local bookstore donated 48 boxes of erasers. There are 24 erasers in each box. If the student council sells the erasers for $0.75 each, how much money will they make?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how much money the student council will make if they sell 48 boxes of scented erasers, with 24 erasers per box, at $0.75 per eraser. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the total number of erasers. Then, I should verify the revenue per eraser. Next, I will multiply the total quantity by the unit price to get gross revenue. Finally, I should double-check the arithmetic and consider whether any costs or constraints are implied that would change the net proceeds, even though the question asks for total money made rather than profit.

> Let me first confirm the total inventory. With 48 boxes and 24 erasers per box, the total number of erasers is 48 times 24, which equals 1,152 erasers. Wait, let me verify that multiplication: 48 × 20 is 960, and 48 × 4 is 192, so 960 + 192 is indeed 1,152 erasers [^notfound].

> Next, I should review the selling price. Each eraser is sold for $0.75, so the revenue per unit is $0.75. I need to ensure I'm using the correct unit price and not mixing cents and dollars, and yes, $0.75 per eraser is consistent with the prompt [^notfound].

> Now, I will calculate the total revenue. Multiplying 1,152 erasers by $0.75 per eraser gives 1,152 × 0.75. Let me think about this carefully: 1,152 × 0.75 is the same as 1,152 × 3/4, which equals 864. So, the total money made is $864. Hold on, I should double-check the arithmetic: 1,000 × 0.75 is 750, 100 × 0.75 is 75, 50 × 0.75 is 37.50, and 2 × 0.75 is 1.50, so 750 + 75 + 37.50 + 1.50 equals 864, confirming the total [^notfound].

> But wait, what if the question is implicitly asking for net profit rather than gross revenue? I should confirm whether any costs are mentioned. The prompt says the bookstore donated the erasers, so there is no purchase cost, and no other expenses are described, which means the gross revenue equals the net proceeds for the purpose of this question. If there were unsold inventory or additional costs, that would change the net, but none are indicated here [^notfound].

> Final answer: The student council will make $864 if they sell all 48 boxes of erasers at $0.75 each [^notfound].

---

The student council will make **$864** by selling all 48 boxes of scented erasers at $0.75 each. This is calculated by multiplying 48 boxes by 24 erasers per box to get 1,152 erasers, then multiplying 1,152 by $0.75 to get $864.

---

## Step-by-step calculation

- **Total number of erasers**: 48 boxes × 24 erasers per box = 1,152 erasers
- **Total revenue**: 1,152 erasers × $0.75 per eraser = $864

---

Therefore, the student council will make **$864** if they sell all the erasers.

At no point in my 10 years journey did anyone sit me down and suggest a career path outside of academia. When I started my BSc I made up my mind to carry on until I had a Ph.D. because that’s the path my professors had trodden before me. My family and non-science friends were always supportive and encouraging of my choices, but their subject-naivety wrapped up with their vicarious enthusiasm for my studies meant I was not pushed to consider other options. I had a student’s perspective of the challenges faced by academics in a developing country, where one could tip the funding game in their favour by sticking to the big disease areas, use the ‘3rd world nation’ label to obtain reduced conference attendance fees, and stretch budgets in creative ways to provide what was needed to do great science. A critical edge in my training came from this environment, borne from a relative lack of funding compared to the big international labs—we simply did not have money to buy ready-to-use kits, and often had to re-use plasticware and make our own reagents to run experiments. Trouble-shooting and innovative solution finding were regular challenges, but combined with an almost obsessive leveraging of my scientific network, meant I still generated enough good data to end up with an oral presentation spot in Toronto, and an as yet unappreciated set of skills that were going to steer me right off my tidy and conventional academic career path.

### Bringing alcohol on campus to raise money: impact on student drinking and drinking problems [^a2dbb433]. Addiction (2008). Low credibility.

Aims

Universities are striving to raise funds, often attracting spectators by selling alcohol at campus events. This study evaluates the effect of a policy change on student drinking at a large western university that had historically banned alcohol on campus but transitioned to permitting the sale of alcohol in some of its facilities.

Methods

Surveys of student drinking and perceptions of other students' drinking were conducted before, during and after the policy change at the transition university (TU) and compared to similar data from a control university (CU). Surveys of student drinking at on-campus and off-campus venues and observations of alcohol service practices were also conducted.

Results

The policy change at the TU was introduced cautiously, and sales to underage drinkers were relatively well controlled. Despite this, student drinking rose initially, then declined after 1 year. Perceptions of the amount of drinking by other students increased slightly, but there was no overall measurable increase in student drinking during the first 3 years of the new policy.

Conclusions

The conservative TU policy-to sell alcohol only at select events and to control sales to minors-may have limited the impact of on-campus alcohol sales on student consumption. Although the study results did not find a stable increase in student drinking, they do not necessarily support the liberalization of campus alcohol policy, because the transition is still 'in progress' and the final outcome has not been evaluated.

### Snacks, sweetened beverages, added sugars, and schools [^6e3635ab]. Pediatrics (2015). Medium credibility.

Snacks, sweetened beverages, added sugars, and schools—pediatricians should consider wellness councils or school health advisory councils as a unique opportunity for influencing student nutrition through collaboration with other professionals invested in child nutrition, especially registered dietitians, school nurses, and school food service directors. Development of policies and practices with the involvement of students and staff can be a potent form of education about quality nutrition. Advocacy efforts of the AAP and its member pediatricians within their state chapters and local school districts should continue to support the efforts of the USDA to improve the school nutrition environment as the best means to ensure the nutritional adequacy of all school-aged children and adolescents.

### Choosing wisely in the UK: the academy of medical royal colleges' initiative to reduce the harms of too much medicine [^62c10b45]. BMJ (2015). Excellent credibility.

Call to action and next steps

To ensure the development of a Choosing Wisely culture in clinical practice, the academy suggests:

Doctors should provide patients with resources that increase their understanding about potential harms of interventions and help them accept that doing nothing can often be the best approach
Patients should be encouraged to ask questions such as, “Do I really need this test or procedure? What are the risks? Are there simpler safer options? What happens if I do nothing?”
Medical schools should ensure that students develop a good understanding of risk alongside critical evaluation of the literature and transparent communication. Students should be taught about overuse of tests and interventions. Organisations responsible for postgraduate and continuing medical education should ensure that practising doctors receive the same education
Commissioners should consider a different payment incentive for doctors and hospitals

Support from the media and medical publications will be vital because the public education campaign is crucial to the programme’s success. The academy will ensure that the programme is thoughtfully implemented and rigorously evaluated by demonstrating a reduction in wasteful practices within a fixed time scale. It will begin by asking specialty organisations to compile top five lists. All lists will be accompanied by an implementation plan and will be evaluated and monitored to assess their effect on reducing low value healthcare.

The academy has set up a steering group to provide policy advice and direction for the project. The group comprises individual experts, patient groups, college representatives and key stakeholders. It is time for action to translate the evidence into clinical practice and truly wind back the harms of too much medicine.

### Impacts of student debt on the professional and personal lives of genetic counselors: a 10-year perspective [^84437477]. Journal of Genetic Counseling (2025). Medium credibility.

A vast majority once again reported feeling burdened by their student debt payments, though this may not be surprising given the current financial climate, reported debt loads, and starting salaries among this cohort. Expert recommendations have traditionally said students should not borrow more than 8%–10% of their projected gross monthly income or 20% of their expected discretionary income. The Institute of Student Loan Advisors leadership has suggested capping the limit even lower, at 10% of discretionary income (Carrns,). Most recently in 2022, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) generally recommended that students not borrow more than their expected starting salary one year after graduation with monthly payments limited to 10% of gross monthly income (Consumer Financial Protection Bureau,).

Personal finance websites likecan be used to estimate monthly payments and feasibility of repayment based on total debt, salary, loan interest rate, and repayment plan. This calculator cannot use median ranges, so a mean for the present sample was calculated using the weighted average of the amounts reported by participants. This is an approximate weighted average for total debt, as the value for the last category (e.g. $120,000 or more) was an interval (e.g. $10,000) higher than the listed value (e.g. $130,000). When applying the 7.05% interest rate (as of July 1, 2023) for Graduate or Professional Direct Unsubsidized Loans to the federal limit of $41,000 across a 2‐year program, the 8.05% rate for Federal Graduate PLUS loans to the remaining $34,325 of the average student debt from this data, a starting salary of $75,325, and the reported approximate weighted average for student debt of $64,366 with a standard fixed‐rate 10‐year repayment plan, the calculator indicates a monthly payment of $894, which equates to about 14% of the average gross monthly income reported in this study. While the total student debt load reported by respondents does not exceed the average starting salary, estimated monthly payments at these interest rates exceed the more liberal recommendation that payments do not exceed 10% of gross monthly income. These calculations support the hypothesis that recent GC program graduates are experiencing similar hardships to their counterparts from 10 years ago. These results indicate ongoing high debt loads and burden from student debt, potentially resulting in the reported impacts on professional and personal life choices.

### School health guidelines to promote healthy eating and physical activity [^6adb1d86]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2011). Medium credibility.

Evaluate healthy eating and physical activity policies and practices—evaluation can be used to assess and improve policies and practices that promote increased physical activity and healthier eating among students and faculty members. All groups involved and affected by school efforts to promote lifelong physical activity and healthy eating should have the opportunity to contribute to evaluation, and education agencies and schools should designate a person to take the lead on evaluation activities. Two fundamental types of evaluation are process and outcome, and in process evaluation, educators collect and analyze data to determine who, what, when, where, and how much of program activities have been conducted. Schools should conduct a process evaluation of their healthy eating and physical activity policies and practices, and although evaluations should not be used to audit or rank schools or penalize school staff members, evaluations can be used to motivate schools to make changes and monitor school-level implementation of school district, state, and federal policies and practices. Outcome evaluation explores whether intended outcomes or specific changes occur as a direct result of policies, programs, or practices, but outcome evaluation can require a great deal of time, money, and expertise, and individual schools are unlikely to be able to conduct outcome evaluations on their own. Process evaluation topics for schools might include the following: Did schools establish a school health council and conduct an assessment of their existing healthy eating and physical activity policies and practices? Did schools provide training to physical education teachers on instructional strategies that would keep all students active for most of physical education class time? Outcome evaluation topics include the following: Did all students in all grades participate in daily recess throughout the school year? Did students’ levels of physical activity increase after they participated in physical education?

### Impacts of student debt on the professional and personal lives of genetic counselors: a 10-year perspective [^2c413486]. Journal of Genetic Counseling (2025). Medium credibility.

Multiple graduates reflected on their experiences, sharing:

I didn ' t feel that I could properly assess how much debt I would need to take on for any of the programs I applied to. It was very hard to find any concrete information about student loan options/scholarships. None of the programs provided transparent information and I did not know how much “student aid” I would get until after I was accepted.

No amount of financial counseling would have let me make a different choice in regard to my grad program though, because the match system does not allow you to really have a choice …. Not to mention that the programs are so selective that it doesn't feel like much of a choice but to go.

A possible explanation for these findings may be more specifically related to when students receive information regarding program costs and aid, the Genetic Counseling Admissions Match, and if/when a financial advisor is consulted. The Accreditation Council for Genetic Counseling (ACGC) required an “estimation of all costs (tuition, fees, etc.) related to the program” to be available online by August 1, 2024 (GC Education,, p. 14); however, this stipulation did not specifically include financial assistance options/availability. Most respondents in this study learned about available financial assistance during the interview process, and another portion did not learn about some or all information until they were accepted or “matched” to a program and in binding commitment to attend. Lack of full financial transparency throughout the entire admissions process limits applicant consideration of financial factors and could impact financial wellness after graduation.

### Guidelines for psychological practice for people with low-income and economic marginalization: executive summary [^900c7222]. The American Psychologist (2021). High credibility.

Low-income and economic marginalization (LIEM)—class blindness bias toward student financial concerns occurs when instructors and supervisors are not aware of daily financial difficulties for LIEM students, such as class fees, parking costs, on-campus healthcare costs, required unpaid assistantships, and credit holds; context includes that cumulative student debt has now surpassed $1.3 trillion and the cost of post-secondary education has increased by 250% in the past 30 years, and within graduate psychology the average student loan debt is now over $100,000 while the average starting salary has remained stable at slightly over $60,000. The page notes some training programs avoid discussing student debt with students; while Faculty must be cautious about discussing the specific financial concerns of students, in order to avoid dual relationships or violation of privacy, avoidance of broader discussion of financial and debt concerns can have a negative effect across the lifespan.

### Saving time and money in biomedical publishing: the case for free-format submissions with minimal requirements [^085cc754]. BMC Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Methods

To review current formatting requirements, we extracted a list of the top 1000 academic journals based on their 2019 CiteScore values, a metric used to measure the average citations per document in a particular journal over a certain period of time. We excluded journals that do not publish original research articles (n = 181) and, from the remaining list, all that are non-biomedical journals (n = 427); we present the detailed selection process in Additional file 1 : Text S1. We then sorted the remaining list (n = 392) by decreasing CiteScore values and included the top 302 biomedical journals for review. The 302 journal titles were divided among all co-authors, who then manually extracted the eight components that we found to vary the most among submission guidelines: the maximum length of the title, running title, abstract, and manuscript text; the structure of the abstract and the manuscript; the maximum number of items (tables and/or figures) and references allowed; and the availability of a submission template on the journal’s website (Additional file 2 : Table S1). If questions arose, the specific co-author and the senior author discussed and resolved them. The co-authors calculated the number of possible formats by computing the number of possible combinations of the eight criteria on which we focus in our review.

We extracted average annual salaries in the European Union and the United States for PhD students, postdocs, assistant professors, associate professors, and full professors, and we averaged these values to calculate an average researcher salary in these regions. Using an estimate of ~ 1750 work hours per year, which is the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) average for the European Union and the United States, we calculated average hourly salaries. Using the four hours of reformatting time per article that Sobani et al. estimated in a previous report and, assuming that each article is desk-rejected and resubmitted once (on average), also proposed by Sobani et al. we estimated the cost of reformatting one article. We then extracted the number of entries published in PubMed each year between 2000 and 2021. Based on the salary estimates and the number of articles, we estimated the annual financial loss between 2000 and 2021. We then used a time-series prediction using quadratic models with years as a predictor using the lm function in R (v.4.2.2) to extrapolate financial loss between 2022 and 2030.

### School health guidelines to promote healthy eating and physical activity [^a761a824]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2011). Medium credibility.

School health council—family and community partnerships: The school health council should identify strategies for establishing partnerships with families and community members, and the school health action plan should include goals that specifically address establishing partnerships with families and community members. To inform the action plan, the school health council can assess the status of family and community partnerships through formal questionnaires, telephone interviews, surveys, or the CDC School Health Index. Families and community members should be invited to provide input on the planning and implementation of healthy eating and physical activity policies, programs, and practices, and their input will help create partnerships that appropriately blend into the community’s culture, resulting in greater awareness and buy-in from students and families. Families and community members can help identify potential challenges to implementing a comprehensive set of policies, programs, and practices, as well as identify community supporters such as cultural or political leaders critical to the success of the initiative.

### School health guidelines to promote healthy eating and physical activity [^672e5e14]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2011). Medium credibility.

Partner with families and community members in the development and implementation of healthy eating and physical activity policies, practices, and programs—key strategies are to: Encourage communication among schools, families, and community members to promote adoption of healthy eating and physical activity behaviors among students; Involve families and community members on the school health council; Develop and implement strategies for motivating families to participate in school-based programs and activities that promote healthy eating and physical activity; Access community programs to help provide healthy eating and physical activity opportunities for students; and Demonstrate cultural awareness in healthy eating and physical activity practices throughout the school. Schools should communicate with families and community members frequently to emphasize that they are a valuable asset in student learning, health, and well-being; lines of communication should be open for feedback from families and other community members; and informational or promotional flyers, newsletters, telephone calls, conversations at school, communication via e-mail or websites, and media coverage can be used for communication; local media outlets provide an opportunity to disseminate school messages and remind families and community members to engage in healthy behaviors. All groups invested in school health, including families and community members, and those who will be affected by policies or programs should have representation on the school health council; in 2006, among the 73% of school districts that had a district school health council, 89% included community members, 76% included families of students, 51% included local health-care providers, 50% included representatives from the local health department.

### School health guidelines to promote healthy eating and physical activity [^fbfc1143]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2011). Medium credibility.

School nutrition standards—implementation guidance and policy requirement—note that nutrition standards list criteria to help schools determine which foods and beverages should be offered on a school campus, and state and local education agencies can pass nutrition standards that are stronger than the federal requirements limiting the sale of competitive foods. Schools should implement nutrition standards that provide students with only healthy choices throughout the regular and extended school day and throughout the campus that are consistent with and reinforce positive nutrition education messages received in the classroom, and portion sizes should be reasonable for the age of the student. The Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 requires each school district’s local wellness policy to include nutritional guidelines for all foods available on each school campus that promote student health and reduce childhood obesity.

### How spending decisions shape happiness in everyday life [^3bb2ab36]. Communications Psychology (2024). Medium credibility.

Subjective well-being

Subjective well-being (SWB) is defined as including three components: high life satisfaction, high positive affect, and low negative affect,. On each survey, participants completed the Satisfaction with Life Scale, rating their agreement with statements such as “I am satisfied with my life” on a scale from “strongly disagree” (1) to “strongly agree” (7). Participants also completed the Scale of Positive and Negative Experience, reporting how frequently in the last month they experienced six positive feelings (e.g. “Happy”) and six negative feelings (e.g. “Sad”) on a scale from “very rarely or never” (1) to “very often or always” (5). The three components were standardized and combined to form a score for subjective well-being.

Spending categories

At the end of each of the three months, participants completed a spending diary, providing detailed descriptions of all purchases they made with the Mystery Experiment money. For every purchase, participants were told to “describe in detail what you spent the money on (please include details like what, where, when, and why)”. By asking participants for free descriptions, we were able to avoid revealing our interest in specific spending categories we examined. Two independent coders then placed their open-ended responses into 26 spending categories (see Supplementary Methods for full coding details). We began with a set of basic spending categories created by a bank, such as utilities, housing, transportation, and education. We then created additional categories to capture key constructs based on the scholarly literature,,, including time-saving purchases and experiences. Coders evaluated whether each purchase did belong (1) or did not belong (0) to each of the 26 categories, and the two coders’ evaluations were highly consistent in both higher and lower-income countries (kappa 0.83–0.98, Supplementary Table S1). For example, the purchase of “Hamilton” tickets for the family was categorized as a gift and also as an experience. A third coder evaluated any disagreements between the initial coders and recoded any systematic errors. Of the 26 categories, 9 categories were rarely used (i.e. contained fewer than 50 purchases in the category). Leading scholars have argued that 50 is a minimun cell size to ensure statistical power. Therefore we excluded these categories from analysis, leaving 17 spending categories (see Supplementary Table S2 for descriptive statistics of the eliminated categories).

### Global health degrees: at what cost? [^83c86baa]. BMJ Global Health (2020). High credibility.

We focused on tuition fees for the entire degree programme rather than the annual tuition fees, since duration of degree programme varied from 1 to 3 years, with some degrees structured in such a way that students’ graduation time was tied to their experiences and training garnered prior to programme entry. Thus, it should be noted that when the final cost was calculated this was based on the typical time to graduation indicated either on the website itself or by the respective school’s programme coordinator. In most European schools, fees are fixed regardless of how long a student takes to complete their degree. However, in North America time to graduation can be quite variable and students usually pay tuition for each semester or credit. This is particularly true of the US system where a degree cost can vary substantially between students. We chose to calculate total tuition based on a typical student’s experience as suggested by either the school’s website or the coordinator.

In addition, some programmes require a project (eg, summer practicum) be conducted in elsewhere (typically, a low-income and middle-income countries (LMIC)—the costs for these were not always absorbed by the tuition fees. While some students had their costs for projects abroad covered by a supervisor and others could apply for scholarships, the remainder would have to pay for the additional costs out of pocket. This information was not transparent across degree programmes.

Given the difficulty in collecting data on tuition itself, we did not quantify cost of living directly for each school. Rather, we aimed to account for differences in living costs for any given school using an adjustment measure used by the International Civil Service Commission (ICSC), established by the United Nations (UN).The UN postadjustment system is designed to ensure that the net remuneration pay of UN staffers garners an equivalent purchasing power to that same staffer at the base of the system, New York City, regardless of their posting location. Post adjustment multiplier considers differences in prices between the city in question and New York; local inflation; exchange rate of local currency relative to the USD; and average expenditure pattern of staff members currently at a given location. The multiplier is adjusted periodically to reflect changes in the cost of living in a given city. We used the multiplier from the March 2020 update. All cost information was converted into US dollars using the ICSC conversion factor (March 2020 update) to make international comparisons possible.

### School health guidelines to promote healthy eating and physical activity [^e083ffca]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2011). Medium credibility.

Coordinated school health approach—School efforts to promote healthy eating and physical activity should be part of a coordinated school health framework that provides an integrated set of planned, sequential, and school-affiliated strategies, activities, and services designed to promote the optimal physical, emotional, social, and educational development of students. A coordinated school health framework involves families and is based on school and community needs, resources, and standards, is coordinated by a multidisciplinary team such as a school health council, and is accountable to the school and community for program quality and effectiveness. School personnel, students, families, community organizations and agencies, and businesses can collaborate to develop, implement, and evaluate healthy eating and physical activity efforts.

### Active children through individual vouchers evaluation: a mixed-method RCT [^3b0ac13e]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

The proportion of participants with high BP in the intervention group fell (baseline, 5.3% [28/524]; 12 months, 2.7% [14/524]), whereas the proportion of participants with high BP in the control increased (baseline, 1.6% [6/384]; 12 months, 3.1% [12/384]). Augmentation pressure and augmentation index improved in both arms. Deprived children in the intervention group saw a significant decrease in augmentation pressure compared with the control group.

Participants were autonomously motivated, with between 96% and 99% of teenagers in both arms autonomously motivated at baseline and 12 months. Total motivation showed a decreasing trend between the 2 timepoints. Girls in the intervention showed a significant decrease (0.6, 95% CI=0.0, 1.1), as well as deprived teenagers (0.6, 95% CI=0.0, 1.1). However, this change in the mean did not impact the percentage of participants who were autonomously motivated in the intervention.

Trampolining accounted for almost half of the voucher usage (49.1%), followed by laser tag (11.5%) and the waterpark (slides and surfing, 7.3%) (Appendix Table 3, available online). ACTIVE helped set up lunchtime clubs in 2 different schools at the request of teenagers, an unstructured football session, dance, and parkour.

The participants used 26.2% (7,545/28,800) of all the vouchers available, and boys made up 52% of the vouchers spent. Common themes for not using the vouchers included the lack of local provision (Appendix Table 4, available online).

Focus group conversations about the impact of the intervention flowed around 2 themes, the breaking down of cost barriers and changes in perception of PA. Teenagers reported they no longer had to ask their parents for money, which had often been a barrier. One boy said he was able to “go places and do different things” because of knowing more about what was available. The local council echoed this, they felt “…they [the vouchers] are making people more aware of what is in the local area so that they can be active…”

### Nutritional labelling for healthier food or non-alcoholic drink purchasing and consumption [^37929e49]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Nutritional labelling is advocated as a means to promote healthier food purchasing and consumption, including lower energy intake. Internationally, many different nutritional labelling schemes have been introduced. There is no consensus on whether such labelling is effective in promoting healthier behaviour.

Objectives

To assess the impact of nutritional labelling for food and non-alcoholic drinks on purchasing and consumption of healthier items. Our secondary objective was to explore possible effect moderators of nutritional labelling on purchasing and consumption.

Search Methods

We searched 13 electronic databases including CENTRAL, MEDLINE and Embase to 26 April 2017. We also handsearched references and citations and sought unpublished studies through websites and trials registries.

Selection Criteria

Eligible studies: were randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials (RCTs/Q-RCTs), controlled before-and-after studies, or interrupted time series (ITS) studies; compared a labelled product (with information on nutrients or energy) with the same product without a nutritional label; assessed objectively measured purchasing or consumption of foods or non-alcoholic drinks in real-world or laboratory settings.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently selected studies for inclusion and extracted study data. We applied the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool and GRADE to assess the quality of evidence. We pooled studies that evaluated similar interventions and outcomes using a random-effects meta-analysis, and we synthesised data from other studies in a narrative summary.

Main Results

We included 28 studies, comprising 17 RCTs, 5 Q-RCTs and 6 ITS studies. Most (21/28) took place in the USA, and 19 took place in university settings, 14 of which mainly involved university students or staff. Most (20/28) studies assessed the impact of labelling on menus or menu boards, or nutritional labelling placed on, or adjacent to, a range of foods or drinks from which participants could choose. Eight studies provided participants with only one labelled food or drink option (in which labelling was present on a container or packaging, adjacent to the food or on a display board) and measured the amount consumed. The most frequently assessed labelling type was energy (i.e. calorie) information (12/28).Eleven studies assessed the impact of nutritional labelling on purchasing food or drink options in real-world settings, including purchases from vending machines (one cluster-RCT), grocery stores (one ITS), or restaurants, cafeterias or coffee shops (three RCTs, one Q-RCT and five ITS). Findings on vending machines and grocery stores were not interpretable, and were rated as very low quality. A meta-analysis of the three RCTs, all of which assessed energy labelling on menus in restaurants, demonstrated a statistically significant reduction of 47 kcal in energy purchased (MD -46.72 kcal, 95% CI -78.35, -15.10, N = 1877). Assuming an average meal of 600 kcal, energy labelling on menus would reduce energy purchased per meal by 7.8% (95% CI 2.5% to 13.1%). The quality of the evidence for these three studies was rated as low, so our confidence in the effect estimate is limited and may change with further studies. Of the remaining six studies, only two (both ITS studies involving energy labels on menus or menus boards in a coffee shop or cafeteria) were at low risk of bias, and their results support the meta-analysis. The results of the other four studies which were conducted in a restaurant, cafeterias (2 studies) or a coffee shop, were not clearly reported and were at high risk of bias.Seventeen studies assessed the impact of nutritional labels on consumption in artificial settings or scenarios (henceforth referred to as laboratory studies or settings). Of these, eight (all RCTs) assessed the effect of labels on menus or placed on a range of food options. A meta-analysis of these studies did not conclusively demonstrate a reduction in energy consumed during a meal (MD -50 kcal, 95% CI -104.41, 3.88, N = 1705). We rated the quality of the evidence as low, so our confidence in the effect estimate is limited and may change with further studies.Six laboratory studies (four RCTs and two Q-RCTs) assessed the impact of labelling a single food or drink option (such as chocolate, pasta or soft drinks) on energy consumed during a snack or meal. A meta-analysis of these studies did not demonstrate a statistically significant difference in energy (kcal) consumed (SMD 0.05, 95% CI -0.17 to 0.27, N = 732). However, the confidence intervals were wide, suggesting uncertainty in the true effect size. We rated the quality of the evidence as low, so our confidence in the effect estimate is limited and may change with further studies.There was no evidence that nutritional labelling had the unintended harm of increasing energy purchased or consumed. Indirect evidence came from five laboratory studies that involved mislabelling single nutrient content (i.e. placing low energy or low fat labels on high-energy foods) during a snack or meal. A meta-analysis of these studies did not demonstrate a statistically significant increase in energy (kcal) consumed (SMD 0.19, 95% CI -0.14to 0.51, N = 718). The effect was small and the confidence intervals wide, suggesting uncertainty in the true effect size. We rated the quality of the evidence from these studies as very low, providing very little confidence in the effect estimate.

Authors' Conclusions

Findings from a small body of low-quality evidence suggest that nutritional labelling comprising energy information on menus may reduce energy purchased in restaurants. The evidence assessing the impact on consumption of energy information on menus or on a range of food options in laboratory settings suggests a similar effect to that observed for purchasing, although the evidence is less definite and also of low quality.Accordingly, and in the absence of observed harms, we tentatively suggest that nutritional labelling on menus in restaurants could be used as part of a wider set of measures to tackle obesity. Additional high-quality research in real-world settings is needed to enable more certain conclusions.Further high-quality research is also needed to address the dearth of evidence from grocery stores and vending machines and to assess potential moderators of the intervention effect, including socioeconomic status.

### The effects of contemporaneous peer punishment on cooperation with the future [^c0626dd4]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Design

Figure 1 illustrates the game structure and procedures. Exactly 12 participants take part in each session and they are randomly divided into four groups consisting of three participants each. In the baseline condition, participants are informed that they will make (at most) one decision and that there are a total of four sequential groups. Moreover, they are informed about the position of their group in the succession of groups and learn that the allocation of participants to the groups is random. After reading a printout of the instructions (reproduced in Supplementary Note 3) and being given an opportunity to ask clarifying questions, the experiment starts. In the baseline condition, each member of Group 1 is endowed with €10. The three members of this group simultaneously face the same decision: they are required to divide their endowment between a private account and a group account. More precisely, they are required to decide how much money to allocate to the group account while the rest of the endowment automatically remains in their private account. If individual contributions to the group account sum to less than €15, the experiment ends instantly and all participants of later groups are informed that the experiment has ended and that their earning from the experimental task are zero. However, if the sum of contributions to the group account amounts to €15 or more (i.e. at least 50% of the total group endowment), the game continues and moves to the next group (Group 2). Independent from the sum of total contributions in the group account, members of Group 1 earn the respective amounts in their private accounts (i.e. the initial endowment of €10 minus their individual contribution to the group account). If the game is sustained, the same procedure applies for members of Groups 2 and 3. The experiment ends with the decision of the members of Group 3. If the contributions of Group 3’s members to the group account sum to €15 or more, then the members of Group 4 each earn €5. Otherwise, members of Group 4 earn nothing. Reaching the threshold exactly costs €15 to the current generation but provides an endowment of €30 to the subsequent generation(s). There is hence a gain in total earnings (across multiple generations) from reaching the threshold. These potential gains from contributing are largest for members of the first generation, but smaller for participants in subsequent generations (with no such gains from Group 3). Choosing €15 as a threshold value has the advantage of facilitating coordination between group members by allowing for individual contributions of €5 (i.e. 50% of the endowment) to be sufficient for reaching the threshold. Hence, it is a symmetric focal point for coordination. At the same time, individual endowments are smaller than the threshold. Hence, no single group member can unilaterally provide the public good and successful provision requires the cooperation of at least two group members.

### Measures implemented in the school setting to contain the COVID-19 pandemic [^6c995027]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

In response to the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), governments have implemented a variety of measures to control the spread of the virus and the associated disease. Among these, have been measures to control the pandemic in primary and secondary school settings.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of measures implemented in the school setting to safely reopen schools, or keep schools open, or both, during the COVID-19 pandemic, with particular focus on the different types of measures implemented in school settings and the outcomes used to measure their impacts on transmission-related outcomes, healthcare utilisation outcomes, other health outcomes as well as societal, economic, and ecological outcomes.  SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, and the Educational Resources Information Center, as well as COVID-19-specific databases, including the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register and the WHO COVID-19 Global literature on coronavirus disease (indexing preprints) on 9 December 2020. We conducted backward-citation searches with existing reviews.

Selection Criteria

We considered experimental (i.e. randomised controlled trials; RCTs), quasi-experimental, observational and modelling studies assessing the effects of measures implemented in the school setting to safely reopen schools, or keep schools open, or both, during the COVID-19 pandemic. Outcome categories were (i) transmission-related outcomes (e.g. number or proportion of cases); (ii) healthcare utilisation outcomes (e.g. number or proportion of hospitalisations); (iii) other health outcomes (e.g. physical, social and mental health); and (iv) societal, economic and ecological outcomes (e.g. costs, human resources and education). We considered studies that included any population at risk of becoming infected with SARS-CoV-2 and/or developing COVID-19 disease including students, teachers, other school staff, or members of the wider community.  DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently screened titles, abstracts and full texts. One review author extracted data and critically appraised each study. One additional review author validated the extracted data. To critically appraise included studies, we used the ROBINS-I tool for quasi-experimental and observational studies, the QUADAS-2 tool for observational screening studies, and a bespoke tool for modelling studies. We synthesised findings narratively. Three review authors made an initial assessment of the certainty of evidence with GRADE, and several review authors discussed and agreed on the ratings.

Main Results

We included 38 unique studies in the analysis, comprising 33 modelling studies, three observational studies, one quasi-experimental and one experimental study with modelling components. Measures fell into four broad categories: (i) measures reducing the opportunity for contacts; (ii) measures making contacts safer; (iii) surveillance and response measures; and (iv) multicomponent measures. As comparators, we encountered the operation of schools with no measures in place, less intense measures in place, single versus multicomponent measures in place, or closure of schools. Across all intervention categories and all study designs, very low- to low-certainty evidence ratings limit our confidence in the findings. Concerns with the quality of modelling studies related to potentially inappropriate assumptions about the model structure and input parameters, and an inadequate assessment of model uncertainty. Concerns with risk of bias in observational studies related to deviations from intended interventions or missing data. Across all categories, few studies reported on implementation or described how measures were implemented. Where we describe effects as 'positive', the direction of the point estimate of the effect favours the intervention(s); 'negative' effects do not favour the intervention.  We found 23 modelling studies assessing measures reducing the opportunity for contacts (i.e. alternating attendance, reduced class size). Most of these studies assessed transmission and healthcare utilisation outcomes, and all of these studies showed a reduction in transmission (e.g. a reduction in the number or proportion of cases, reproduction number) and healthcare utilisation (i.e. fewer hospitalisations) and mixed or negative effects on societal, economic and ecological outcomes (i.e. fewer number of days spent in school). We identified 11 modelling studies and two observational studies assessing measures making contacts safer (i.e. mask wearing, cleaning, handwashing, ventilation). Five studies assessed the impact of combined measures to make contacts safer. They assessed transmission-related, healthcare utilisation, other health, and societal, economic and ecological outcomes. Most of these studies showed a reduction in transmission, and a reduction in hospitalisations; however, studies showed mixed or negative effects on societal, economic and ecological outcomes (i.e. fewer number of days spent in school). We identified 13 modelling studies and one observational study assessing surveillance and response measures, including testing and isolation, and symptomatic screening and isolation. Twelve studies focused on mass testing and isolation measures, while two looked specifically at symptom-based screening and isolation. Outcomes included transmission, healthcare utilisation, other health, and societal, economic and ecological outcomes. Most of these studies showed effects in favour of the intervention in terms of reductions in transmission and hospitalisations, however some showed mixed or negative effects on societal, economic and ecological outcomes (e.g. fewer number of days spent in school). We found three studies that reported outcomes relating to multicomponent measures, where it was not possible to disaggregate the effects of each individual intervention, including one modelling, one observational and one quasi-experimental study. These studies employed interventions, such as physical distancing, modification of school activities, testing, and exemption of high-risk students, using measures such as hand hygiene and mask wearing. Most of these studies showed a reduction in transmission, however some showed mixed or no effects.   As the majority of studies included in the review were modelling studies, there was a lack of empirical, real-world data, which meant that there were very little data on the actual implementation of interventions.

Authors' Conclusions

Our review suggests that a broad range of measures implemented in the school setting can have positive impacts on the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, and on healthcare utilisation outcomes related to COVID-19. The certainty of the evidence for most intervention-outcome combinations is very low, and the true effects of these measures are likely to be substantially different from those reported here. Measures implemented in the school setting may limit the number or proportion of cases and deaths, and may delay the progression of the pandemic. However, they may also lead to negative unintended consequences, such as fewer days spent in school (beyond those intended by the intervention). Further, most studies assessed the effects of a combination of interventions, which could not be disentangled to estimate their specific effects. Studies assessing measures to reduce contacts and to make contacts safer consistently predicted positive effects on transmission and healthcare utilisation, but may reduce the number of days students spent at school. Studies assessing surveillance and response measures predicted reductions in hospitalisations and school days missed due to infection or quarantine, however, there was mixed evidence on resources needed for surveillance. Evidence on multicomponent measures was mixed, mostly due to comparators. The magnitude of effects depends on multiple factors. New studies published since the original search date might heavily influence the overall conclusions and interpretation of findings for this review.

### Impacts of student debt on the professional and personal lives of genetic counselors: a 10-year perspective [^9a7bd30c]. Journal of Genetic Counseling (2025). Medium credibility.

Order of job choice priorities remained consistent. Location was rated as most influential by participants in 2013 (58%; n = 228/393), followed by specialty (11%) and salary (11%). While there was no significant change in rating location as at least somewhat influential on job choice from 2013 to 2023 (p = 0.161), salary increased by 15 (95% CI: 9.7–19.9; p < 0.001) percentage points (78% [2013] vs. 93% [2023]), and specialty increased by 10 (95% CI: 3.3–15.5; p = 0.003) percentage points (75% [2013] vs. 85% [2023]; Figure 3a).

FIGURE 3 
Percent of respondents who indicated that student debt was influential on job choice (a) and life milestones (b) in 2013 (gray) and 2023 (red). *Indicates a statistically significant change from 2013 to 2023 (p < 0.05).

Most participants (94% [n = 253/269]) held full‐time positions, an insignificant change from 2013 (92%; 352/384; p = 0.251). Median starting salary for full‐time workers increased ($70,000 to $75,000 [range: <$50,000 to $115,000]), compared with the starting salary in 2013 ($45,000 to $55,000 [range: <$35,000 to $95,000+]) without adjusting for inflation (p < 0.001; Figure 1c). This represents an estimated 45% increase between median range midpoints, which is generally in line with the 51% increase reported by NSGC from 2013 to 2023, though direct comparison is made difficult given the nature of the interval responses in this survey. Median current salary also increased before accounting for inflation, to $80,000 to $85,000 (Range: <$50,000 to over $140,000) from $55,000 to $65,000 (Range: <$35,000 to $95,000+) in 2013 (p < 0.001).

### Consumption habits of school canteen and non-canteen users among Norwegian young adolescents: a mixed method analysis [^37ab0a54]. BMC Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Prices, timing, and permission for visiting shops

In many instances, it was reported that although leaving school grounds was not allowed during school hours in individual school policy, many students frequently did so in order to visit local food shops during breaks. There were reports of shop visits outside school hours as well (before/after school). Some students also discussed the cheaper prices at the shops, as compared to the school canteen, as being an incentive to purchase from shops.

Girl2: We have some in the class that shoot off to the shops to buy some sort of fast food every day.

Interviewer: So you are allowed to leave the school in your free time to buy food?

Girl2: No, but after school or right before.

Girl4:.They go over [to the shops] when the lunch break starts, then you see them come back when everyone has to go outside then.

Boy4: Because then there are no teachers out.and then it is easy to take a trip to the shops and.

Boy1: Buy cheaper things. Because they sell at a high price here.

The paradox between students visiting shops in school hours, although not allowed, was also pointed out by school staff:

Teacher1: …no, it is not allowed (to go to the shops), but there are some that do it anyway.

Headmaster6:.of course the schools must represent counterculture in some way….so our students go to the shops…and then they make use of the offers that are there…as long as they have money from home.

Teacher2: …and they prefer to go (to the shops) in a group at the same time, because it is social and fun.

### Improving the school food environment and dietary intake of Dutch primary school students through the provision of a healthy school lunch: results of a pre-posttest effectiveness study [^d2859dbf]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Active parental consent was obtained for all children before the study started. Children also gave verbal consent for their participation. Parents could request at any time to withdraw their children from the study. Across the three schools, 23 children did not have parental consent at any point during the study period and were excluded. Additionally, 35 children initially (at T0) lacked consent but obtained it later, while 24 children initially had consent but later lost it. Furthermore, 8 children (not included in the 24) withdrew from the study due to transferring to another school. The available data from these children was included in the analyses for each individual time point but not in the analyses of changes over time. The study has been approved by the Social Ethical Committee of Wageningen University, the Netherlands (nr. 09131098) and is registered at the Netherlands trial register (NTR):.

All lunch products were funded by the project. Additionally, the costs of cups, lunchboxes, equipment (e.g. fridge, serving plates), and delivery were also covered by the project. Schools did not receive additional funding for implementing or organizing the school lunch. The research team supported the logistical and practical arrangements for the lunch, while the actual execution was the responsibility of the schools, often assisted by volunteers such as parents. A voluntary financial contribution was requested from parents to help cover the lunch costs, but no records were kept of whether or how much individual parents contributed. Each classroom had a small box where children could drop off their contributions. Schools were free to allocate the collected funds as they wished, but based on the schools’ experiences, little to no money was typically found in these boxes.

### Scaling and sustaining effective early childhood programs through school-family-university collaboration [^f3a6b8da]. Child Development (2017). Low credibility.

Example 4: Scaling and Financing Through PFS

Given the low rate of success in scaling evidence‐based programs, new approaches to financing have been developed. One of the most prominent is called social impact bonds or Pay for Success (PFS). In PFS, mission investors consisting of private partners and/or philanthropic organizations loan funds to public sector jurisdictions (e.g. school districts, counties) to expand programs (Government Accountability Office, 2015 ; Temple & Reynolds, 2015). To the extent that these services are found to generate cost savings to the public sector, a state or local government is obligated to make payments to the investors based on the estimated cost savings. Economic evaluation is crucial in both determining the suitability of programs to be financed and in determining the magnitude of the “success” payments.

PFS illustrates the role of shared ownership and committed resources in program expansion (Table 1). Through a PFS initiative with the City of Chicago, the Midwest CPC has begun further expansion in the Chicago Public Schools. In this financing structure, Goldman Sachs, Northern Trust, and the Pritzker Family Foundation provide $17 million in loans for the operational costs of new classrooms, which will serve an additional 2,600 children over the next 4 years (Human Capital Research Collaborative, 2014). The city will repay the loans only if the program improves outcomes as determined by an independent evaluation.

Midwest Expansion and PFS Planning

In the planning phase, the city engaged our team to help develop the initiative. The CPC program under the Midwest expansion was selected because it was showing strong initial findings and the district was committed. The program also had a long track record of effectiveness in promoting student success and cost savings. Two cost–benefit analyses documented that at an average cost per child of $9,500 (2015) for preschool, benefits exceed costs by a factor of 7–10 (Reynolds, Temple, Robertson, & Mann, 2002 ; Reynolds, Temple, White, et al. 2011). A large percentage of the economic return was savings in special education, juvenile court, and child welfare. For example, the annual cost per child of special education is over $15,000 above and beyond regular instruction. The majority of this cost is covered by the district. Given the direct relationship between the city and the district, the focus of the PFS was special education savings.

### The role of spending money and drinking alcohol in adolescent smoking [^920379a7]. Addiction (2008). Low credibility.

Aims

Previous studies have shown inconsistent findings with regard to the association between amount of spending money and adolescent smoking. Drinking alcohol may be a mediator of the association between spending money and adolescent smoking. However, no studies have examined this potential role. The objective of this study was to investigate the association between amount of spending money and adolescent smoking and the potential mediation role of alcohol use in this association.

Design

The 2003 Ontario Student Drug Use Survey of students in grades 7-12.

Measurements

Multivariable logistic, probit and linear regression models were used to investigate the association between amount of spending money and smoking, and the contribution of drinking alcoholic beverages to this relationship.

Findings

Spending money was associated positively with experimental smoking, current smoking and daily consumption of cigarettes (P < 0.01). The analysis adjusted for confounders showed that students with spending money > or =$20/week were significantly more likely to be experimental smokers, students with > or =$30/week were significantly more likely to be current smokers and students with > or =$60/week smoked significantly more cigarettes/day (P < or = 0.05), compared to students with <$10/week. Alcohol use was an important mediator, responsible for 81% of the association of spending money with experimental smoking, 38% with current smoking and 37% with daily consumption of cigarettes.

Conclusions

Amount of spending money was associated significantly and positively with smoking among adolescents, and alcohol use mediated this association. Integrated tobacco prevention programs may be more effective, and increasing taxes on cigarettes and alcohol would increase price sensitivity among youth and protect against adolescent smoking.

### Impacts of student debt on the professional and personal lives of genetic counselors: a 10-year perspective [^7e0193b0]. Journal of Genetic Counseling (2025). Medium credibility.

Thirty‐three percent of respondents in 2023 (n = 92/282) said previous student debt was somewhat or extremely important in influencing when they attended their GC program; a 12‐percentage point increase from 2013 (21%; n = 79/381; p < 0.001). Over half (56%; n = 157/282) of respondents from 2023 shared that previous student debt was somewhat or extremely important in influencing which GC program they attended, a 14‐percentage point increase from 2013 (41%; n = 158/381; p < 0.001). Forty‐nine percent of those from 2023 said prior student debt did not influence their decision to pursue GC graduate training (n = 137/282), though 26% said it was somewhat or extremely important in making this decision.

When considering factors used to determine which GC program participants ranked highly or attended, 86% (n = 248/287) indicated that program cost was at least somewhat influential in their choices, as well as cost of living/housing (80%), and financial assistance available (68%; Table 2). For the 2023 cohort, those who said program cost and living/housing were highly influential on program choice generally spent less on tuition and fees (r s = −0.37, p < 0.001 and r s = −0.21, p < 0.001, respectively), indicating that students who considered/ranked programs heavily based on financial factors generally attended more inexpensive programs. Participants were also asked to identify the single most influential factor in determining which GC program they ranked highly or attended. Location was deemed most influential by the largest percentage of respondents (30%; n = 85/287), followed by program cost (23%), and program assistance available (11%; Table 2). Location was also rated as most influential in determining program choice 10 years ago (38%; n = 157/410), followed by training program cost (15%), and training program structure/curriculum (15%). The percentage who claimed location was most important decreased 9 (95% CI: 1.5–15.6, p = 0.018) percentage points from 2013 (38%) to 2023 (30%), while the percentage who claimed cost as the most important factor increased 8 percentage points (15% vs. 23%; 95% CI: 1.9–13.9, p = 0.009).

Academic department and training program practices—It can be valuable for psychologists to familiarize themselves with the costs of education and financial aid resources, normalize professors’ familiarity with financial aid procedures to help low-income students, and invite financial aid officers to speak to departmental staff and faculty as a valuable systemic intervention. There are opportunities to engage in national student debt conversations, and doctoral, internship, and postdoctoral programs can examine practices that contribute to financial strain and replace them with more affordable practices; for example, onsite interviews may be replaced with high quality videoconferencing meetings at a relatively low cost for programs, dramatically reducing travel and application costs for applicants.

Acknowledging these biases, here are the 2024 articles that we think deserve your attention or at least a second read.

### Guidelines for psychological practice for people with low-income and economic marginalization: executive summary [^7c61d132]. The American Psychologist (2021). High credibility.

Guideline 1—supporting literature on college experiences—indicates that low-income students and first-generation college students are less likely to feel prepared for college, endorse lower self-efficacy concerning their adjustment to college, are more likely to have outside employment, have increased financial stress, feel more distress concerning balance between home life/academic life, and are less likely to engage with support programs on campus; the cultural mismatch between low-income students and universities is well documented and has a negative impact on retention, and having classroom norms, rules, and assignments that encourage independence over interdependence has shown to decrease retention for low-income/first generation college students, so it may be helpful for psychologists to be mindful of how college culture and activities may perpetuate independence bias or a cultural mismatch for students from low-income families.

### The impact of community-based childhood obesity prevention interventions in Australia by socio-economic position: an individual participant data meta-analysis [^ae3b2fbe]. Pediatric Obesity (2025). Medium credibility.

3.2 Behavioural results

There was a positive intervention effect on activity level for low SEP students, with an increase in the proportion of students that were highly active in the intervention group relative to the control group (difference = 11.3 [95%CI 6.3, 16.4]) (Figure 1). High SEP students' activity levels in the control group increased to a greater degree than those in the intervention group. This resulted in a 17.4 percentage point (95% CI 9.8, 25.1) difference in the intervention effect in low compared to high SEP areas, on the proportion of students being highly active. There was an increase in the proportion of high SEP control students meeting fruit consumption guidelines (5.7 [95%CI: 2.0, 9.4]), resulting in a significant difference in the intervention effect on high compared to low (difference: 7.0 [95%CI 0.8, 13.2]) and medium (difference: 6.9 [95%CI 0.6, 13.2]) SEP students. A positive intervention effect was observed for the change in the proportion of students consuming one or less takeaway meals per week (4.7 [95%CI 1.5, 7.8]) for those living or going to school in medium SEP areas, which was significantly higher than the intervention effect for high SEP students (difference: 5.6 [95%CI 0.8, 10.4]).

Negative results indicate greater change in control group; positive results indicate greater change in intervention group. ^ p < 0.05 for intervention effect. * p < 0.05 for difference in intervention effect with high SEP.

Overall, control students reduced their sugar sweetened beverage intake, with the proportion of those consuming less than one sugar sweetened beverage increasing between the baseline and endpoint (3.0, 95%CI 0.7, 5.3), resulting in a negative intervention effect of −3.3 percentage points, (95% CI −6.4, −0.2). There were no significant results for active transport or meeting screen time guidelines overall, or by SEP (Table S4).

### 'Pro-tobacco propaganda': a case study of tobacco industry-sponsored elementary schools in China [^cb25652e]. Tobacco Control (2020). Medium credibility.

To generate gratitude

Students and teachers expressed gratitude as a direct result of Hongta Group’s school sponsorship, a trend present across all three schools sampled. Teachers from the sponsored school expressed ‘gratitude to the tobacco company for improvements to our learning and teaching environment’ (teacher 1) and have mentioned the benefactor to their students for ‘providing such great help’ (teacher 2).

Students, regardless of which school they came from, were also thankful: ‘we should study hard because we have a new school building now. I will study hard to repay them’ (grade 5 student 1) and thought ‘Hongta’s donation means they are kind’ (grade 5 student 2) and ‘they like to help others’ (grade 5 student 3). Although students from the control school were more reserved in being thankful, Hongta’s sponsorship of the school was ‘more out of kindness’ (grade 6 student 1) and that ‘elementary school students don’t understand what promotion is, so do not see it as such’ (grade 6 student 2). Some students were more critical:

Hongta is profiting from people’s lives, they are using money earned from people’s lives to help others. The money was made from selling cigarettes, so this philanthropy is based on smokers’ lives. Hongta shouldn’t use smokers’ lives to help others. (Grade 5 student 4)

Other students were more conflicted: ‘it’s hard to say if tobacco companies are good or bad. They are bad because they make health damaging products, but they are good because they engage in philanthropy’ (grade 6 student 3).

Tobacco control experts subsequently confirmed these findings, stating that the tobacco industry ‘implements projects that are likely to generate a sense of thankfulness and gratitude’ (expert 1).

### The impact of racism on child and adolescent health [^1d07e4cc]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

School, community, and policy actions to address racism in child and adolescent health—support local educational systems by connecting with and supporting school staff, and note that the AAP Council on School Health provides resources to help physicians engage with schools and guidelines on roles of school physicians and school health personnel. Advocate for federal and local policies that support implicit-bias training in schools and robust training of educators in culturally competent classroom management to improve disparities in academic outcomes and disproportionate rates of suspension and expulsion among students of color, reflecting a systemic bias in the educational system. Advocate for increased access to support for mental health services in schools designed to help teachers better manage students with disruptive classroom behaviors and to reduce racial disparities in school expulsion. Advocate for curricula that are multicultural, multilingual, and reflective of the communities in which children in their practices attend school, and advocate for policies and programs that diversify the teacher workforce to mitigate the effects of the current demographic mismatch of teachers and students that affects academic attitudes and attainment for all students. Advocate for evidence-based programs that combat racism in the education setting at a population level, and encourage community-level advocacy with members of those communities disproportionately affected by racism to develop policies that advance social justice. Advocate for alternative strategies to incarceration for management of nonviolent youth behavior, collaborate with first responders and community police to enhance positive youth engagement by sharing expertise on child and adolescent development and mental health, considering potential differences in culture, sex, and background, and advocate for fair housing practices, including access to housing loans and rentals that prohibit the persistence of historic "redlining."

### How might secondary dementia prevention programs work in practice: a pre-implementation study of the APPLE-tree program [^b476e190]. BMC Geriatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Participants who supported finding funding for APPLE-Tree and similar programs commonly discussed the need to apply for additional funding from commissioners or the local council. Within the CFIR construct ‘cost’, one participant described, “ We get a lot through grants from the councils, but we can also apply for funding,” (third sector service manager, #8).

A minority of (5/26) participants, all from third sector sites, mentioned the possibility of funding dementia prevention programs by charging patients for each session: “ I mean, we have goals for how to make it a sustainable group, for instance, we do have to charge so much money for people to come along each week, to help make the service sustainable for us and not depend on funding,” (third sector service manager, #12). Others thought it would be possible to find additional funding without charging patients. When asked about whether funding could be found, one commissioner responded, “ Absolutely. And, of course, it should be the case that you receive the funding just because you’re improving people’s quality of life,” (NHS commissioner, #20).

Some participants were concerned about whether they would be able to find enough additional funding to deliver APPLE-Tree in its current form. One participant discussed the challenge of paying for a clinical psychologist to monitor the program: “ I hadn’t realized you needed it to be supervised by clinical psychologists, because again, you’re adding a cost to all this, and I’m not clear why that’s necessary, because obviously that is a very expensive cost,” (third sector service manager, #3). Another participant described challenges with the program structure: “ It’s funding and if I can deliver, I suppose if it means that we can deliver ten sessions, for example, with one facilitator but could only deliver five with two, I might opt for the ten so that people are getting the most out of it as possible,” (third sector service manager, #7).

### Consumption habits of school canteen and non-canteen users among Norwegian young adolescents: a mixed method analysis [^e876b6f7]. BMC Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Our results profile the OFT group as being mostly male, skipping breakfast, with a high frequency of shop visits during and on the way to/from school, and with a higher frequency of snacks, baked sweets, and soft-drinks, elements which have featured in previous studies regarding adolescent consumer behaviour [,–]. A clear association between adolescents skipping breakfast and subsequent purchases of foods from shops and fast food outlets, usually on the way to or from school [,–], in addition to other health-compromising behaviours have been previously reported.

Although direct questions regarding pocket money were absent from our study, its role in the behaviour of this sample is evident from statements mentioning money use in the school administration interviews as well as alluded to in focus group interviews. Additionally, it stands to reason that adolescents using the school canteen often (i.e. the OFT group) would be equipped with money in order to make such purchases, as financial purchases are the norm in Norwegian secondary schools. Research directed upon adolescents and pocket money has presented a number of findings that support our results regarding the OFT group, whereby access to spending money was associated with an increase of nutritionally poor food choices by adolescents, such as the increased consumption of fast-foods, soft-drinks, and unhealthy snacks off campus [–,–]. These results may also be indicative of a gender imbalance in regards to pocket money provisions, where some studies report upon more males than females receiving pocket money.

The mean age of this sample previously has been described as a stage in life of an emerging autonomy for young individuals, an autonomy which is exercised in terms of disposable income use and consumption of foods away from home. This period of emerging autonomy may also manifest unhealthy eating behaviours as a strategy to forge identity amongst adolescents. Frequent mention by students and staff in this study of themes relating to peer influence and defiance of school rules support the link between rebelliousness and unhealthy eating. Moreover, it has been reported previously that foods independently purchased by adolescents are often unhealthy, forbidden or frowned upon by parents, and express a defiant period of appearing ‘cool’ among peers, especially amongst males [,–], all of which support our findings here, particularly regarding gender, self-efficacy, and peer influence.

### Guidelines for psychological practice for people with low-income and economic marginalization: executive summary [^1209bb45]. The American Psychologist (2021). High credibility.

Research and training inclusivity—raising students’ awareness of socioeconomic status (SES) concerns in research can be very valuable and might involve reading relevant literature or integrating such issues into research methods courses. Teaching students how to effectively measure SES can be quite useful, with Best Practices in Conceptualizing and Measuring Social Class in Psychological Research cited as an excellent starting point, and students are advised to choose measures informed by the type of social class information sought. Students might also strive to be aware of cultural sensitivity and the potential for exploitation when studying economically marginalized populations, noting that financial incentives and power differentials may be more likely to have an adverse impact on the economically marginalized.

### Guidelines for psychological practice for people with low-income and economic marginalization: executive summary [^a2c22581]. The American Psychologist (2021). High credibility.

Student support and bias reduction in academic settings—reducing the cognitive distance between the lives of psychologists and low-income students can be helpful in reducing class bias and can start with simple curiosity and affirmation. Being open and affirming when students raise social class concerns can create an environment in which economically marginalized students can succeed, and becoming involved with first‑generation college student organizations and higher education programs designed to help students from marginalized backgrounds can be helpful in learning common themes that students from LIEM backgrounds struggle with at the institution (e.g., Upward Bound, Young Scholars, McNair Scholars).

### Wilderness Medical Society clinical practice guidelines on anaphylaxis [^63beca9d]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Table 2—Anaphylaxis at the National Outdoor Leadership School (NOLS) and Outward Bound (OB), 2005 through 2019—Among students, annual enrollment (mean±SD) was 5093±190 at NOLS and 41,732±2427 at OB, with ages 20 [10] (6–84) and 16 [4] (10–78), respectively; anaphylaxis cases in all students were 21 (0.03%) at NOLS and 39 (0.01%) at OB over field time of 1,945,057 and 1,839,730 person-days (p-d), corresponding to anaphylaxis incidence of 1/96,622 (10 per million p-d) at NOLS and 1/46,173 (21 per million p-d) at OB. Among instructors, ages were 32 [10] (20–72) at NOLS and 27 [7] (18–77) at OB, with 3 and 7 anaphylaxis cases, and at NOLS field time 486,534 p-d with incidence 1/162,178 (6 per million p-d). Totals (students + instructors) were 24 cases at NOLS and 46 at OB; cases per year (mean±SD) were 2±2 (0–10) for NOLS and 3±2 (0–8) for OB, and anaphylaxis deaths were 0 in both cohorts.

### Measures implemented in the school setting to contain the COVID-19 pandemic: a scoping review [^e6e69bdc]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

In response to the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and the impact of COVID-19, national and subnational governments implemented a variety of measures in order to control the spread of the virus and the associated disease. While these measures were imposed with the intention of controlling the pandemic, they were also associated with severe psychosocial, societal, and economic implications on a societal level. One setting affected heavily by these measures is the school setting. By mid-April 2020, 192 countries had closed schools, affecting more than 90% of the world's student population. In consideration of the adverse consequences of school closures, many countries around the world reopened their schools in the months after the initial closures. To safely reopen schools and keep them open, governments implemented a broad range of measures. The evidence with regards to these measures, however, is heterogeneous, with a multitude of study designs, populations, settings, interventions and outcomes being assessed. To make sense of this heterogeneity, we conducted a rapid scoping review (8 October to 5 November 2020). This rapid scoping review is intended to serve as a precursor to a systematic review of effectiveness, which will inform guidelines issued by the World Health Organization (WHO). This review is reported in line with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) checklist and was registered with the Open Science Framework.

Objectives

To identify and comprehensively map the evidence assessing the impacts of measures implemented in the school setting to reopen schools, or keep schools open, or both, during the SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 pandemic, with particular focus on the types of measures implemented in different school settings, the outcomes used to measure their impacts and the study types used to assess these.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register, MEDLINE, Embase, the CDC COVID-19 Research Articles Downloadable Database for preprints, and the WHO COVID-19 Global literature on coronavirus disease on 8 October 2020.

Selection Criteria

We included studies that assessed the impact of measures implemented in the school setting. Eligible populations were populations at risk of becoming infected with SARS-CoV-2, or developing COVID-19 disease, or both, and included people both directly and indirectly impacted by interventions, including students, teachers, other school staff, and contacts of these groups, as well as the broader community. We considered all types of empirical studies, which quantitatively assessed impact including epidemiological studies, modelling studies, mixed-methods studies, and diagnostic studies that assessed the impact of relevant interventions beyond diagnostic test accuracy. Broad outcome categories of interest included infectious disease transmission-related outcomes, other harmful or beneficial health-related outcomes, and societal, economic, and ecological implications.

Data Collection and Analysis

We extracted data from included studies in a standardized manner, and mapped them to categories within our a priori logic model where possible. Where not possible, we inductively developed new categories. In line with standard expectations for scoping reviews, the review provides an overview of the existing evidence regardless of methodological quality or risk of bias, and was not designed to synthesize effectiveness data, assess risk of bias, or characterize strength of evidence (GRADE).

Main Results

We included 42 studies that assessed measures implemented in the school setting. The majority of studies used mathematical modelling designs (n = 31), while nine studies used observational designs, and two studies used experimental or quasi-experimental designs. Studies conducted in real-world contexts or using real data focused on the WHO European region (EUR; n = 20), the WHO region of the Americas (AMR; n = 13), the West Pacific region (WPR; n = 6), and the WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMR; n = 1). One study conducted a global assessment and one did not report on data from, or that were applicable to, a specific country. Three broad intervention categories emerged from the included studies: organizational measures to reduce transmission of SARS-CoV-2 (n = 36), structural/environmental measures to reduce transmission of SARS-CoV-2 (n = 11), and surveillance and response measures to detect SARS-CoV-2 infections (n = 19). Most studies assessed SARS-CoV-2 transmission-related outcomes (n = 29), while others assessed healthcare utilization (n = 8), other health outcomes (n = 3), and societal, economic, and ecological outcomes (n = 5). Studies assessed both harmful and beneficial outcomes across all outcome categories.

Authors' Conclusions

We identified a heterogeneous and complex evidence base of measures implemented in the school setting. This review is an important first step in understanding the available evidence and will inform the development of rapid reviews on this topic.

### Guidelines for psychological practice for people with low-income and economic marginalization: executive summary [^8954d743]. The American Psychologist (2021). High credibility.

Low-income and economic marginalization (LIEM)—idealization bias refers to portraying people who are poor as hard-working underdogs pursuing the American dream, which can misrepresent students from LIEM backgrounds and undermine needs; the bias rests on the false belief that people in poverty do not work hard and those who work hard are not impoverished, frames poverty as a choice that ignores systemic factors, and places expectations on poor people to work harder with an often false promise that effort will transcend economic conditions.

§ Costs of potential additional transportation, where needed, were estimated assuming that such costs are equivalent to a 36% increase of FY18 state expenditures for student transportation.

¶ Low percentage cost calculated using only the average cost per student for materials and consumables. High percentage cost calculated using high average total cost per student, which includes all three cost categories (Materials and Consumables, Custodian FTEs [high est.], and Potential additional transportation).

** Percentage increase in expenditure per student above FY18 levels.

†† Total costs for each category of state estimates fall within the national range of estimates per category. The national range uses a range of prices nationwide for that item, multiplied by the number of units nationally, adjusted by the highest and lowest nationwide cost of living index. The state estimates are specific to each state’s school population and are estimated using a combination of past year transportation expenditures, the average wage for custodians, and average price of materials in that state, with adjustments for the state-specific cost of living index.

### Time for nutrition in medical education [^0451272f]. BMJ Nutrition, Prevention & Health (2020). High credibility.

Methods

Medical student and doctor opinions of nutrition training were gathered by accumulating data from a curriculum review of nutrition content, teaching evaluations and available heterogeneous surveys of medical students and doctors identified between 2015 and 2018, as summarised in figures 1 and 2.

Figure 1

Methods for the curriculum review and surveys are summarised based on the methods reported by the student and junior doctors who designed the surveys and completed the data collection. Data were analysed by EM, LB and KM, who were not involved with the design or data collection of the original surveys. Where possible we have estimated sample sizes using publicly available numbers of medical students. However, while acknowledging the flaws in individual data collection, heterogeneous designs and small sample sizes, overall data were pooled where there were recurrent themes. From this, a comparative analysis of the findings was undertaken using the following three questions:

Do medical students or doctors believe nutrition in medical education and clinical practice is important? What further training do they feel they need?
How much nutrition content is there in current training and what are the preferred learning methods?
How confident are doctors in their nutrition knowledge and skills? What is the self-perceived role of doctors in nutritional care?

The ERimNN-led (Education and Research in Medical Nutrition Network) curriculum review and subsequent curriculum development of the nutrition curriculum in a single medical school between 2015 and 2018 followed an action research methodology, which encompassed a cycle of evaluation, implementation, review and reflection(figure 2). Nutrition content was mapped against lecture titles, learning objectives and assessment tasks. These were compared with the UK General Medical Council’s (GMC) expected learning outcomes identified by the Intercollegiate Group on Nutrition curriculum framework (2013)and those included in the 2015 GMC ‘Outcomes for Graduates’.

### Assessment of SARS-CoV-2 screening strategies to permit the safe reopening of college campuses in the United States [^86998f32]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Screening

We sought to evaluate both existing SARS-CoV-2 detection methods and newer technologies that could plausibly be available in the near future. Accordingly, we considered a range of different test sensitivities (ie, 70%-99%), specificities (ie, 98%-99.7%),, and per-test costs (ie, $10-$50). For each combination of these test characteristics, we considered both symptom-based screening and routine testing every 1, 2, 3, and 7 days. We assumed that a confirmatory test with 100% specificity could distinguish false-positive from true-positive results at a cost of $100.

Cost-effectiveness

Next, we estimated incremental cost-effectiveness ratios, denominated in screening costs per infection averted. This measure of return on investment in screening was compared with a crude benchmark of value estimated using the following 4 terms: (1) COVID-related mortality (0.05% in persons of college age; 0.4% overall); (2) survival loss of 60 years per college-age fatality; 20 years overall; (3) societal willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of $100 000 per year of life gained; and (4) R t + 1, assuming that each infection averted prevents half the R t secondary infections among college-age students and half among other adult members of the campus community. This method yielded a maximum WTP to avert 1 infection of $5500 in the best case, $8500 in the base case, and $11 600 in the worst case.

Cost-effectiveness analysis identified a preferred screening strategy from among 13 possibilities—3 test sensitivities (70%, 80%, and 90%) and 4 frequencies (1, 2, 3, and 7 times per week) in addition to symptom-based screening—under each epidemic scenario (base, worst, and best cases) already described. We also considered the more restricted case, in which the only available test cost $25 and had a sensitivity of 80%. Finally, to help decision-makers understand the fiscal consequences of pursuing these preferred strategies, we conducted a budget impact assessment, reporting the cumulative costs for the semester on a per-student basis.

Statistical Analysis

The model was implemented as a spreadsheet. All analyses were conducted in Microsoft Excel. Because no statistical tests were run, no prespecified level of statistical significance was set.

### Guidelines for psychological practice for people with low-income and economic marginalization: executive summary [^6c0ff8b9]. The American Psychologist (2021). High credibility.

Research/evaluation applications—psychologists are encouraged to take SES issues into account when teaching research methods, especially concerning sampling, and students should be encouraged to be thoughtful of the impact of their research on communities and to use their research to support economically marginalized communities when possible and to mitigate against economic exploitation and harm that could be by-products of research. Finally, training programs are strongly encouraged to be intentional about the way that they introduce SES as a multicultural topic to students, and the authors recommend that SES issues be discussed early in multicultural training and as a unique component of identity that has been disentangled from other cultural variables.

### Guidelines for assessment of and intervention with persons with disabilities [^3c420f58]. The American Psychologist (2012). Medium credibility.

Post-secondary disability services—legal rights, admissions, and privacy—are characterized by differences from K-12; generally, the legal rights and responsibilities from K-12 to post-secondary schooling are dramatically different, with post-secondary students required to seek and request accommodations through their disability services office and to know what supports they may require and how to find them, whereas in K-12 the school is responsible for identifying accommodations and providing reasonable accommodations for student success. Disability status should not play a role in the admissions process and is confidential, not indicated in applications unless a student chooses to disclose it, and admission status has no bearing on providing accommodations. In college, disability records are protected by the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), which protects all students by giving eligible students or parents more control over educational records and blocks disclosure of personally identifiable information, including a student’s specific disability, without written permission unless otherwise mandated by law; accommodation letters do not include specific diagnoses, disability service records are not part of an academic record, and disability-related information is not included on a student’s transcript.

### A "Council of caregivers" and dementia friends geriatrics person-centered session for first-year medical students [^8091279c]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2025). Medium credibility.

4 Discussion

We developed, implemented, and evaluated a person‐centered dementia session for first‐year medical students for two consecutive years that included a CoC and DFI. Medical students uniformly found the session valuable and generally recommended it should be a required component of medical student education. Most medical students responded to an open‐ended prompt with comments that they found both the CoC and DFI portions to be informative. Student comments were positive about providing care as future doctors for persons with dementia and personal connections with grandparents with the disease. We will continue implementing this session and work with the course director to increase student attendance at the session.

There were limitations identified. First, students who attended the session were interested in an older adult curriculum, potentially skewing our findings toward more positive results. Second, we received less than 70% completion of our evaluations. Finally, we have not assessed the long‐term impact of the session, or was a validated tool to assess knowledge and attitudes included. In future iterations, implementing validated assessments of knowledge and attitude should be considered. The dementia session provides a promising model for medical student dementia education that can be replicated. We will use student feedback to improve the quality of this person‐centered approach, with the goal of making the session a required component of medical students' first year of training.

### Increasing active travel to school: are we on the right track? A cluster randomised controlled trial from sydney, Australia [^53e330b0]. Preventive Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the effectiveness of a program to increase walking to and from school.

Design

A cluster randomised controlled trial.

Setting

24 primary public schools in inner west Sydney, Australia.

Participants

1996 students aged 10-12 years and their parents.

Intervention

A two-year multi-component program included classroom activities, development of school Travel Access Guides, parent newsletters and improving environments with local councils.

Measures

Two measures were used: a survey completed by students on how they travelled to and from school over five days, and a survey completed by their parents on how their child travelled to and from school in a usual week.

Results

The percentage of students who walked to and from school increased in both the intervention and control schools. Data from parent surveys found that 28.8% of students in the intervention group increased their walking, compared with 19% in the control group (a net increase of 9.8%, p=0.05). However this effect was not evident in the student data.

Conclusion

The study produced a mixed result, with a high variation in travel patterns from school to school. Intervention research should address the complexity of multiple factors influencing student travel to school with a focus on changing local environments and parents' travel to work.

### Comparison of SARS-CoV-2 test positivity in NCAA division I student athletes vs nonathletes at 12 institutions [^e68bba49]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Results

Among more than 4 million tests included in the study, 555 372 tests were among student athletes, with 2425 positive results (0.44%), and 3 482 845 tests were among nonathlete students, with 30 567 positive results (0.88%). Of 65 Power 5 schools, 13 schools had publicly available information on athlete and nonathlete test positives, total number of tests, and positivity (Table). One school was excluded given that the time period of data available did not meet the minimum duration determined in inclusion criteria. The remaining 12 schools were included in the analysis, 9 of which had statistically significantly decreased test positivity in the student athlete population compared with the nonathlete student population (University of Arkansas: 0.01% vs 3.52%; University of Minnesota: 0.63% vs 5.96%; Penn State University: 0.74% vs 6.58%; Clemson University: 0.40% vs 1.88%; University of Louisville: 0.75% vs 3.05%; Purdue University: 0.79% vs 2.97%; University of Michigan: 0.40% vs 1.12%; University of Illinois: 0.17% vs 0.40%; University of Virginia: 0.64% vs 1.04%) (P <. 001 for each) (Box). The median (range) test positivity in these 9 schools was 0.46% (0.01%-0.79%) for student athletes and 1.04% (0.40%-6.58%) for nonathlete students (Figure 1). The relative risk for student athletes at these schools vs nonstudent athletes ranged from 0.002 (95% CI, 0.0005-0.01) for the University of Arkansas to 0.61 (95% CI, 0.54-0.70) for the University of Virginia (Figure 2). Of the remaining 3 schools, there was no statistically significant difference in test positivity at 2 of them, and 1 institution had a statistically significantly increased test positivity among student athletes (Stanford University: 0.20% vs 0.05%; relative risk, 4.08 [95% CI, 3.04-5.48]; P <.001). Overall, the relative risk for student athletes vs nonathlete students was 0.50 (95% CI, 0.48-0.52; P <.001) (Figure 2).

### Organisational and student characteristics, fidelity, funding models, and unit costs of recovery colleges in 28 countries: a cross-sectional survey [^ee1dcaf0]. The Lancet: Psychiatry (2023). High credibility.

Background

Recovery colleges were developed in England to support the recovery of individuals who have mental health symptoms or mental illness. They have been founded in many countries but there has been little international research on recovery colleges and no studies investigating their staffing, fidelity, or costs. We aimed to characterise recovery colleges internationally, to understand organisational and student characteristics, fidelity, and budget.

Methods

In this cross-sectional study, we identified all countries in which recovery colleges exist. We repeated a cross-sectional survey done in England for recovery colleges in 28 countries. In both surveys, recovery colleges were defined as services that supported personal recovery, that were coproduced with students and staff, and where students learned collaboratively with trainers. Recovery college managers completed the survey. The survey included questions about organisational and student characteristics, fidelity to the RECOLLECT Fidelity Measure, funding models, and unit costs. Recovery colleges were grouped by country and continent and presented descriptively. We used regression models to explore continental differences in fidelity, using England as the reference group.

Findings

We identified 221 recovery colleges operating across 28 countries, in five continents. Overall, 174 (79%) of 221 recovery colleges participated. Most recovery colleges scored highly on fidelity. Overall scores for fidelity (β=-2·88, 95% CI 4·44 to -1·32; p=0·0001), coproduction (odds ratio [OR] 0·10, 95% CI 0·03 to 0·33; p<0·0001), and being tailored to the student (OR 0·10, 0·02 to 0·39; p=0·0010), were lower for recovery colleges in Asia than in England. No other significant differences were identified between recovery colleges in England, and those in other continents where recovery colleges were present. 133 recovery colleges provided data on annual budgets, which ranged from €0 to €2550000, varying extensively within and between continents. From included data, all annual budgets reported by the college added up to €30 million, providing 19864 courses for 55161 students.

Interpretation

Recovery colleges exist in many countries. There is an international consensus on key operating principles, especially equality and a commitment to recovery, and most recovery colleges achieve moderate to high fidelity to the original model, irrespective of the income band of their country. Cultural differences need to be considered in assessing coproduction and approaches to individualising support.

### A frugal CRISPR kit for equitable and accessible education in gene editing and synthetic biology [^d647d764]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

High school data collection

All reagents were prepared in a laboratory setting, frozen in a −30 °C freezer overnight, and transported to a local high school in a cardboard box on the morning when the tests were conducted. Reagents were not kept frozen during transport and were allowed to thaw gradually. The following was performed for two independent classes on the same day. Students were split into groups of 2-3 (each class contained around 20 students), and each group was given a CRISPRkit containing plasmid DNA, dCas9 protein, pre-aliquoted myTXTL Sigma 70 Master Mix, and 25 inoculation loops. Also distributed were the CRISPRkit protocols. Students were allowed as much time as they needed to complete the protocol, and all groups concluded by the end of 30 min. At least two instructors were present during the lab to answer questions. After the conclusion of both classes, kits were collected and incubated at 28 °C for 24 hrs. After 24 hrs, images were taken and used for CRISPectra analysis.

On Day 2, kits were transported back to the local high school so that students could interpret their results, draw conclusions, and ask any final questions.

Statistical analysis

For all one-way ANOVA tests, t-tests, and multiple comparison corrections, the level of significance (alpha) was set to 0.05. For each test, we assumed a Gaussian distribution of residuals and equal standard deviations for all conditions. The data generated by this study can be broadly classified into four categories, depending on the type of comparison made.

The first category consists of experiments that compared the expression levels of a single gene, encoding either a chromoprotein or fluorescent protein, under either a targeting sgRNA or no guide conditions using either Cas9 or dCas9 (Figs. 2 c, d, 5 a, 7e, Supplementary Fig. 3a). For each of these experiments, an unpaired two-tailed Student’s t-test was used to compare the means of the fluorescence or absorbance values for the no guide and targeting sgRNA condition groups. P values calculated from these t-tests are displayed within each figure.

### Organized sports for children, preadolescents, and adolescents [^5837c4e8]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

Advocacy and policy—schools and community—states that “pediatricians are an important part of their local community” and, regarding organized sports, the pediatrician “is valuable in promoting healthy and safe participation.” “Knowledge about the local community’s school guidelines for physical education is important,” and at preschool/elementary levels, knowing motor skill programming and assessments allows promotion of early intervention for children not meeting milestones. Understanding local school sports and physical education options helps advocacy for “a wide variety of options (competitive level, sport, etc) to keep students involved.” In community programs, the pediatrician has expertise on age of start and promoting “fun, successful practices,” and “advocating for practice and game schedules that allow for appropriate rest and recovery is also needed.”

### Supervision in genetic counselor training in north America: a systematic review [^0c1378b3]. Journal of Genetic Counseling (2019). Medium credibility.

Genetic counseling has been a profession for over 40 years, and training programs accredited by the Accreditation Council for Genetic Counseling are required to have students supervised in at least 50 patient-facing cases prior to graduation. However, there is no standardized information or training for supervisors of genetic counseling students. As a first step toward creating formal and standardized supervision training, we undertook a systematic review of the genetic counseling student supervision literature. A formal systematic review was conducted including establishing a research question with inclusion and exclusion criteria, establishing search terms, searching databases, reading/screening abstracts, examining full texts for inclusion, assessing for quality, and finally extracting data with a standardized form to provide the basis of the review. In all, 151 papers were screened, of which 19 and two erratum were found to meet inclusion criteria and pass quality measures. Main themes from these papers were as follows: Training Model, Competencies, Investigation of Techniques, Difficulties in Supervision, and Barriers. In total, 19 papers provided evidence for the way that supervision is currently being performed and suggestions for what needs further investigation to direct supervision training. Recommendations for genetic counseling student supervision include the following: provide a review of training models to supervisors; provide a copy of the supervision competencies to supervisors; use competencies with lowest self-efficacy to inform future supervision trainings; and find ways to support genetic counselors in becoming student supervisors.
