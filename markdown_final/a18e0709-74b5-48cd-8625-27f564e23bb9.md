## Question

Is Penicillin V an appropriate treatment for MRSA bacteremia?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether Penicillin V is an appropriate treatment for MRSA bacteremia and why or why not. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical severity and standard-of-care approach to MRSA bacteremia. Then, I should verify Penicillin V's spectrum, route, and FDA labeling. Next, I need to review the mechanism of MRSA resistance to beta-lactams. After that, I should check guideline-recommended therapies for MRSA bacteremia and whether Penicillin V appears anywhere. Finally, I will synthesize these layers and confirm the conclusion with regulatory and evidence-based support, also considering any edge cases or potential counterarguments before closing with a clear recommendation.

> Let me first confirm the clinical entity here: MRSA bacteremia is high-risk with substantial mortality and frequent metastatic complications, which mandates prompt intravenous bactericidal therapy and a careful search for deep foci and endocarditis; management includes serial blood cultures to document clearance and, in many cases, echocardiography to exclude endocarditis, with treatment commonly extending for 2–6 weeks depending on complications and source control, so I need to ensure any proposed agent fits this severity profile and pharmacokinetic requirement [^112aB5oL] [^111sDnDT].

> Now, I should review Penicillin V's pharmacologic profile and label; Penicillin V is a narrow-spectrum oral beta-lactam indicated for mild to moderately severe infections due to penicillin G–susceptible organisms, guided by culture data when available, and importantly it is not active against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, so I must be cautious not to overextend its use beyond labeled and microbiologically supported indications [^114fk4T8].

> Wait, let me verify the resistance biology before drawing conclusions; MRSA carries the mecA gene encoding PBP2a, which reduces affinity to essentially all classic beta-lactams, rendering MRSA by definition resistant to penicillins like Penicillin V and most cephalosporins and carbapenems, so from a mechanism standpoint Penicillin V will not have reliable activity against MRSA regardless of dose or timing, which means any efficacy claim would run counter to the core resistance determinant in this pathogen.

> Hold on, I should confirm the regulatory constraints directly; the FDA label for Penicillin V contains an explicit note that severe infections including bacteremia should not be treated with Penicillin V during the acute stage, and its streptococcal indication specifically excludes bacteremia, which is a clear regulatory signal that Penicillin V is not appropriate for bloodstream infection management and certainly not for MRSA bacteremia [^114fk4T8].

> Next, I need to check the route-of-administration and pharmacokinetics; bacteremia requires reliable intravenous exposure early in therapy, whereas Penicillin V is oral only with variable absorption, and even FDA labeling for related oral antistaphylococcal penicillins cautions that the oral route should not be relied upon in severe illness because therapeutic absorption may be unreliable, so Penicillin V's PK profile alone makes it a poor choice for acute bacteremia management even before considering resistance [^115EY61x] [^114fk4T8].

> I should now review guideline-aligned therapy for MRSA bacteremia; IDSA guidance supports IV vancomycin as first-line with daptomycin as an effective alternative, with therapy tailored to MICs, therapeutic drug monitoring (AUC-based targets for vancomycin), clearance of bacteremia, and source control, and Penicillin V is not included in any recommended regimens for MRSA bacteremia, which reinforces its inappropriateness here [^114Rr8LM] [^115w7nNq] [^114Fo532] [^114TiAfx].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I almost generalized a dosing schedule; I initially thought "vancomycin 15 mg/kg IV q6h" applies across the board, but let me correct that: q6h is the pediatric schedule often cited, whereas in adults dosing is individualized to achieve PK/PD targets with AUC-guided therapeutic drug monitoring, so the adult standard is not a fixed q6h interval, and that nuance does not change the conclusion that Penicillin V has no role in MRSA bacteremia therapy [^114Rr8LM] [^116LcAiy].

> I need to ensure combination strategies don't offer a loophole; randomized data adding an antistaphylococcal beta-lactam to vancomycin or daptomycin for MRSA bacteremia did not improve a composite 90-day outcome, and when beta-lactams are considered, they are IV antistaphylococcal agents like flucloxacillin, cloxacillin, or cefazolin, not oral Penicillin V, so there is no evidence-based combination pathway that would justify Penicillin V in MRSA bacteremia [^113uYSHx] [^11793oqq].

> But wait, what if one argued for step-down after clearance; I should double-check that too, because even step-down strategies for complicated S. aureus bacteremia remain cautious, with emerging options like dalbavancin studied for completion therapy after initial IV clearance in selected complicated SAB, yet none of this substitutes Penicillin V for MRSA bacteremia, as dalbavancin is a long-acting IV lipoglycopeptide and step-down eligibility is tightly defined and excludes acute bacteremia control with oral agents like Penicillin V [^115AUgpD].

> Synthesis time, and I need to ensure nothing is overlooked; Penicillin V is inappropriate for MRSA bacteremia on multiple independent axes: microbiology (MRSA's PBP2a-mediated class resistance), regulatory labeling (explicit do-not-use for bacteremia in the acute stage), pharmacokinetic/route issues (oral absorption is unreliable in severe illness), clinical practice guidelines (absent from all MRSA bacteremia regimens), and severity mismatch (an oral drug for mild infections cannot be relied on for a life-threatening bloodstream infection), so using Penicillin V here would risk treatment failure and harm [^114fk4T8] [^115EY61x] [^114Rr8LM].

> Final check and recommendation; Penicillin V is not an appropriate treatment for MRSA bacteremia, and clinicians should follow guideline-concordant therapy with IV vancomycin or daptomycin, ensure prompt source control, obtain serial blood cultures to document clearance, and evaluate for endocarditis with appropriate imaging, adjusting duration based on whether the bacteremia is uncomplicated or complicated, none of which includes any role for Penicillin V in this setting [^114Rr8LM] [^112aB5oL] [^115srBTr].

Penicillin V is **not effective for MRSA bacteremia** because MRSA universally resists beta-lactams — including penicillin V — via mecA-mediated production of PBP2a. Penicillin V is **explicitly contraindicated [^114fk4T8] for bacteremia** and severe infections. The recommended first-line therapies for MRSA bacteremia are **intravenous vancomycin or daptomycin** [^114Rr8LM] [^112qw5nQ]; alternatives include linezolid, ceftaroline, or telavancin for persistent or complicated cases [^notfound]. Using penicillin V for MRSA bacteremia risks treatment failure, persistent bacteremia, metastatic complications, and increased mortality [^115srBTr].

---

## Mechanism of resistance

MRSA resistance to beta-lactams — including penicillin V — is mediated by the **mecA gene**, which encodes penicillin-binding protein 2a (PBP2a). PBP2a has low affinity for beta-lactam antibiotics, rendering these agents ineffective at inhibiting cell-wall synthesis. This well-documented mechanism is universally present in MRSA strains, making all beta-lactams, including penicillin V, ineffective against MRSA infections [^111NYEvM].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines from the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and other authoritative bodies [^115hGc1Z] explicitly **recommend against using penicillin V** or any beta-lactam for MRSA bacteremia [^114D2QMm]. Instead, the following antibiotics are recommended:

- **Vancomycin**: Intravenous vancomycin is the first-line treatment for MRSA bacteremia [^114D2QMm], with dosing adjusted to maintain therapeutic trough levels (15–20 mcg/mL) [^116LcAiy].

- **Daptomycin**: An alternative to vancomycin [^112qw5nQ], particularly in cases of vancomycin intolerance or resistance [^114Rr8LM].

- **Linezolid, ceftaroline, telavancin**: These antibiotics are considered in cases of persistent or complicated MRSA bacteremia [^1156vTRT], or when first-line agents are contraindicated or ineffective [^11291DFi] [^1113MbZX].

---

## Clinical outcomes and risks associated with inappropriate antibiotic use

Using penicillin V for **MRSA bacteremia** would result in:

- **Treatment failure**: Persistent bacteremia due to ineffective antibiotic therapy [^111sDnDT].

- **Increased mortality**: MRSA bacteremia has a high mortality rate (15–25%) [^116McRrj], and ineffective treatment significantly increases this risk [^115srBTr] [^113uYSHx].

- **Metastatic complications**: Persistent bacteremia can lead to metastatic infections, including endocarditis, osteomyelitis, and abscess formation [^115srBTr].

- **Antibiotic resistance**: Inappropriate antibiotic use contributes to the development of further resistance, complicating future treatment options [^111TabHQ].

---

## Alternative antibiotic therapies for MRSA bacteremia

Effective antibiotic therapies for **MRSA bacteremia** include:

| **Antibiotic** | **Dosage** | **Clinical considerations** |
|-|-|-|
| Vancomycin | 15–20 mg/kg IV every 8–12 hours | - First-line therapy [^114D2QMm] <br/> - Monitor trough levels (15–20 mcg/mL) [^116LcAiy] |
| Daptomycin | 6–10 mg/kg IV once daily | - Alternative to vancomycin [^112qw5nQ] <br/> - Monitor for muscle toxicity [^114Rr8LM] |
| Linezolid | 600 mg IV/PO every 12 hours | - Alternative for persistent or complicated infections [^114D2QMm] <br/> - Monitor for hematologic toxicity |
| Ceftaroline | 600 mg IV every 12 hours | Alternative for persistent or complicated infections [^1156vTRT] |
| Telavancin | 10 mg/kg IV once daily | Alternative for persistent or complicated infections [^11291DFi] |

---

## Conclusion

Penicillin V is **not effective for MRSA bacteremia** due to universal resistance mediated by the mecA gene [^114D2QMm]. Current clinical guidelines explicitly recommend against its use; alternatives include vancomycin, daptomycin, linezolid, ceftaroline, and telavancin, selected based on clinical circumstances [^114D2QMm] [^112qw5nQ]. Using penicillin V for MRSA bacteremia would result in treatment failure, increased mortality, and further antibiotic resistance [^115srBTr] [^111TabHQ].

### Penicillin V potassium [^114fk4T8]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Penicillin V potassium is used to reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of penicillin V potassium and other antibacterial drugs. It should only be used to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When available, culture and susceptibility information should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.

Penicillin V potassium tablets are indicated in the treatment of mild to moderately severe infections due to penicillin G-sensitive microorganisms. Therapy should be guided by bacteriologic studies, including sensitivity tests, and by the clinical response.

Note: Severe pneumonia, empyema, bacteremia, pericarditis, meningitis, and arthritis should not be treated with penicillin V during the acute stage. Indicated surgical procedures should be performed.

- **Streptococcal infections (without bacteremia)**:
	- Mild-to-moderate infections of the upper respiratory tract, scarlet fever, and mild erysipelas.

Note: Streptococci in groups A, C, G, H, L, and M are very sensitive to penicillin. Other groups, including group D (enterococcus), are resistant.

Regarding specific circumstances for infective endocarditis, particularly concerning pediatric patients and antibiotic therapy for MRSA, the IDSA 2011 guidelines recommend administering vancomycin at 15 mg/kg/dose IV every 6 hours for 2–6 weeks. The duration depends on factors such as the source, presence of endovascular infection, and metastatic foci of infection in pediatric patients with bacteremia and IE caused by MRSA. As an alternative option, consider administering daptomycin at 6–10 mg/kg/dose IV once daily. It is advised not to use clindamycin or linezolid in pediatric patients with IE.

Vancomycin and daptomycin are options for the initial treatment of patients with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bacteremia. Treatment options for persistent MRSA bacteremia, or bacteremia due to vancomycin-intermediate or vancomycin-resistant strains, include daptomycin, ceftaroline, and combination therapies. There is a critical need for high-level evidence from clinical trials to allow optimally informed decisions in the treatment of MRSA bacteremia.

### Antibiotic prophylaxis for the prevention of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) related complications in surgical patients [^114kidTv]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

The risk of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection after surgery is generally low but can affect up to 33% of patients after certain types of surgery. Postoperative MRSA infections may present as surgical site infections (SSIs), chest infections, or bloodstream infections (bacteraemia). The incidence of MRSA SSIs varies from 1% to 33%, depending upon the type of surgery performed and the carrier status of the individuals concerned. The optimal prophylactic antibiotic regimen for preventing MRSA after surgery is not yet determined.

- **Objectives**: To compare the benefits and harms of all methods of antibiotic prophylaxis in preventing postoperative MRSA infections and related complications in surgical patients.

- **Search methods**: In March 2013, a comprehensive search was conducted in the following databases: The Cochrane Wounds Group Specialized Register; The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE) (The Cochrane Library); NHS Economic Evaluation Database (The Cochrane Library); Health Technology Assessment (HTA) Database (The Cochrane Library); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid MEDLINE (In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations); Ovid EMBASE; and EBSCO CINAHL.

- **Selection criteria**: Only randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included, comparing one antibiotic regimen used as prophylaxis for SSIs (and other postoperative infections) with another antibiotic regimen or with no antibiotic. Importantly, these RCTs reported the methicillin resistance status of the cultured organisms. There were no language restrictions applied to the search for RCTs.

### Combination therapy with lysin CF-301 and antibiotic is superior to antibiotic alone for treating methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus-induced murine bacteremia [^1139try3]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Combinations of CF-301 with antibiotics are more efficacious in treating S. aureus bacteremia than treating with antibiotics alone. Mice with staphylococcal-induced bacteremia were treated with CF-301 and SOC antibiotics. In a low-challenge model, mice were inoculated intraperitoneally with 7.5 × 10⁶ CFU of MRSA MW2 and treated 4 hours later with CF-301, daptomycin, or a combination of both. At 72 hours, treatment with CF-301 yielded 13% survival, whereas treatment with daptomycin yielded 23% survival. The combination of CF-301 with daptomycin resulted in 73% survival, demonstrating that combination therapy was superior to either drug alone (P < 0.0001).

- **Combination therapy superiority**: Combination therapy is superior to monotherapy in murine models of Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia. At time 0, mice were challenged intraperitoneally with either 7.5 × 10⁶ colony-forming units (CFU)/mouse (low-challenge model) or 1.0 × 10⁹ CFU/mouse (high-challenge model) in mucin and were subsequently treated at various times with either antibiotic, CF-301, CF-301 combined with antibiotic, or buffer control. Single-bolus doses were used, with the exception of vancomycin (VAN; twice daily) and oxacillin (OXA; 4 times daily), which were administered as multiple doses over the first 24-hour period. Different routes of administration were used for CF-301 (intraperitoneal), daptomycin and vancomycin (subcutaneous), and oxacillin (intramuscular). P values were calculated for combinations vs. antibiotic alone. Each dataset is a compilation of several individual studies (n = 10–20 per study).

### Effect of vancomycin or daptomycin with vs without an antistaphylococcal β-lactam on mortality, bacteremia, relapse, or treatment failure in patients with MRSA bacteremia: A randomized clinical trial [^113uYSHx]. JAMA (2020). High credibility.

Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bacteremia is associated with a mortality rate of more than 20%. Combining standard therapy with a β-lactam antibiotic has been associated with reduced mortality, although adequately powered randomized clinical trials of this intervention have not been conducted.

The objective of this study was to determine whether combining an antistaphylococcal β-lactam with standard therapy is more effective than standard therapy alone in patients with MRSA bacteremia. This open-label, randomized clinical trial was conducted at 27 hospital sites in four countries from August 2015 to July 2018, among 352 hospitalized adults with MRSA bacteremia. Follow-up was completed on October 23, 2018.

Participants were randomized to receive standard therapy (intravenous vancomycin or daptomycin) plus an antistaphylococcal β-lactam (intravenous flucloxacillin, cloxacillin, or cefazolin) (n = 174) or standard therapy alone (n = 178). The total duration of therapy was determined by treating clinicians, and the β-lactam was administered for 7 days.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: The primary endpoint was a 90-day composite of mortality, persistent bacteremia at day 5, microbiological relapse, and microbiological treatment failure. Secondary outcomes included mortality at days 14, 42, and 90; persistent bacteremia at days 2 and 5; acute kidney injury (AKI); microbiological relapse; microbiological treatment failure; and duration of intravenous antibiotics.

The data and safety monitoring board recommended early termination of the study prior to its completion.

### SHEA/IDSA/APIC practice recommendation: Strategies to prevent methicillin-resistant transmission and infection in acute-care hospitals: 2022 update [^1144ygUW]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2023). High credibility.

Recommendations are categorized as either (1) essential practices that should be adopted by all acute-care hospitals, or (2) additional approaches that can be considered in locations and/or populations within hospitals when MRSA transmission is not controlled by essential practices. Essential practices include recommendations where the potential to affect risk for transmission or infection of MRSA clearly outweighs the potential for undesirable effects.

Additional approaches include recommendations where the intervention is likely to reduce MRSA risk, but there is concern about the risks of undesirable outcomes, the quality of evidence is low, the cost-to-benefit ratio may be high, or evidence supports the intervention's impact only in select settings (e.g. during outbreaks) or for select patient populations. Hospitals can prioritize their efforts by initially focusing on the implementation of prevention strategies listed as essential practices.

If MRSA surveillance or other risk assessments suggest ongoing opportunities for improvement, hospitals should consider adopting some or all of the prevention approaches listed as additional approaches. These can be implemented in specific locations or patient populations or across the hospital, depending on outcome data, risk assessment, and/or local requirements. Each infection prevention recommendation has been given a quality-of-evidence grade.

### The empirical combination of vancomycin and a β-lactam for staphylococcal bacteremia [^1121VHpw]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

The high prevalence of methicillin resistance among Staphylococcus aureus bacteremias leads to the common use of vancomycin as empirical therapy. However, investigators have reported poor outcomes with vancomycin treatment for methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia. We review the evidence supporting the empirical combination of both vancomycin and a β-lactam agent for Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia. Vancomycin therapy for methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia is associated with 2–3 times the risk of morbidity and mortality compared to an antistaphylococcal penicillin (such as oxacillin and nafcillin) or a first-generation cephalosporin (such as cefazolin). De-escalation of empirical vancomycin to definitive β-lactam therapy still appears inferior to initial β-lactam therapy. Although there is no clinical trial supporting combination therapy, a scientific rationale for benefit exists and should be weighed against the risks — such as adverse events, antibiotic resistance, and cost — of additional pharmacotherapy. The empirical combination of vancomycin and a β-lactam (either nafcillin, oxacillin, or cefazolin) for staphylococcal bacteremia may improve infection-related clinical outcomes.

### Acquisition of daptomycin resistance in patients results in decreased virulence in Staphylococcus aureus [^115QGDWp]. Infection and Immunity (2025). Low credibility.

Staphylococcus aureus is a major cause of bacteremia, with an estimated incidence of 9.3–65 cases per 100,000 per year and a 30-day mortality rate between 18% and 29%. Some sources of staphylococcal bacteremia, such as infective endocarditis or osteomyelitis, are particularly difficult to treat. The choice of treatment primarily relies on antimicrobial susceptibility. Bacteremia caused by methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA) is usually treated with antistaphylococcal penicillins, whereas those caused by methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) or MSSA in penicillin-allergic patients are treated with daptomycin, vancomycin, or linezolid. However, treatment with both vancomycin and daptomycin can be complicated by resistance that can arise via spontaneous mutations occurring during treatment.

Acquisition of antimicrobial resistance frequently appears to be associated with changes in virulence. For example, vancomycin-intermediate Staphylococcus aureus can exhibit reduced fitness as a result of a thickened cell wall, enhanced capsular polysaccharide production, and dysfunction of the Agr virulence regulatory system. The consequences of daptomycin resistance on fitness and virulence are not well established.

Daptomycin compromises bacterial surface integrity by targeting cell wall biosynthesis and membrane disruption, which may drive bacteria to alter cell surface characteristics and consequently affect immune host defense recognition. Moreover, daptomycin shares a similar mechanism of action to host innate immune cationic antimicrobial peptides (AMPs).

### Dalbavancin for treatment of Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia: The DOTS randomized clinical trial [^115AUgpD]. JAMA (2025). High credibility.

Dalbavancin is a long-acting intravenous lipoglycopeptide that may be effective for the treatment of complicated Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia without requiring long-term intravenous access.

- **Objective**: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of dalbavancin versus standard therapy for the completion of treatment of complicated S. aureus bacteremia.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: This open-label, assessor-masked, randomized clinical trial was conducted from April 2021 to December 2023 at 23 medical centers in the US (n = 22) and Canada (n = 1). Participant follow-up lasted 70 days (180 days for participants with osteomyelitis); the date of final follow-up was December 1, 2023. Hospitalized adults with complicated S. aureus bacteremia who achieved blood culture clearance following at least 72 hours but no more than 10 days of initial antibacterial therapy were included. Participants were excluded if they had central nervous system infection, retained infected prosthetic material, left-sided endocarditis, or severe immune compromise.

- **Interventions**: Participants were randomly assigned to receive either 2 doses of intravenous dalbavancin (n = 100; 1500 mg on days 1 and 8) or 4 to 8 total weeks of standard intravenous therapy (n = 100; cefazolin or antistaphylococcal penicillin if methicillin susceptible; vancomycin or daptomycin if methicillin resistant).

- **Main outcomes and measures**: The primary outcome was the desirability of outcome ranking (DOOR) at day 70, which involved 5 components: clinical success, infectious complications, safety complications, mortality, and health-related quality of life.

### Predicting risk for death from MRSA bacteremia [^111TabHQ]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a worldwide concern; it colonizes and infects patients in the hospital and in the community. For the past 50 years in the United States, the standard therapy has been vancomycin. Recent vancomycin treatment failures have raised questions regarding optimal treatment. Although new antimicrobial drugs (e.g. linezolid, daptomycin, tigecycline) have been developed, none has been consistently superior to vancomycin for the treatment of MRSA, and MRSA resistance rapidly develops for many new drugs. Some studies have suggested MIC creep (increasing vancomycin MICs against MRSA over time), but others have not. In 2006, the upper limit of vancomycin susceptibility for S. aureus was redefined, lowered from 4 µg/mL to 2 µg/mL, first by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute and soon thereafter by the US Food and Drug Administration and the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility.

Vancomycin treatment failures for MRSA occur even when MICs are within the range considered susceptible, especially 1–2 µg/mL. Among high-risk bacteremic patients, Sakoulas et al. documented treatment failure rates of 44% when vancomycin MICs were < 0.5 µg/mL and of 90% when vancomycin MICs were 1–2 µg/mL (p = 0.01). Hidayat et al. found that mortality rates were higher for patients infected with strains with higher vancomycin MICs.

Some apparently susceptible strains of MRSA might actually be heteroresistant vancomycin-intermediate S. aureus (hVISA) strains. That is, although the hVISA isolates seem to be susceptible to vancomycin.

### Daptomycin plus fosfomycin versus daptomycin alone for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia and endocarditis: A randomized clinical trial [^114BA7ZL]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). High credibility.

Methods

- **Study design and setting**: We performed a randomized (1:1), multicenter, phase 3, superiority, open-label, and parallel-group clinical trial of adult inpatients with MRSA bacteremia at 18 Spanish hospitals. Participants were recruited between December 2013 and November 2017. The ethics committee at each participating center approved the study protocol. The trial was conducted in agreement with the Declaration of Helsinki, the guidelines for Good Clinical Practice, and Spanish regulatory requirements. This academic trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01898338, and the protocol has been published elsewhere.

- **Participants**: Patients aged ≥ 18 years with MRSA bacteremia, indicated by one or more positive blood cultures within the last 72 hours before randomization and with symptoms and signs of infection, were eligible for the study. Patients or authorized representatives provided written informed consent. Exclusion criteria included life expectancy ≤ 24 hours, polymicrobial bacteremia, pneumonia as a source of bacteremia, prosthetic valve endocarditis, severe end-stage liver disease (Child-Pugh class C), New York Heart Association functional classification III/IV, prior history of eosinophilic pneumonia, any clinical condition that required additional antibiotic therapy active against MRSA, or allergy to daptomycin or fosfomycin.

- **Randomization and masking**: Patients were randomly assigned to receive either 10 mg/kg of daptomycin intravenously daily plus 2 g of fosfomycin intravenously every 6 hours, or to receive 10 mg/kg of daptomycin intravenously daily.

Regarding medical management for infective endocarditis, particularly with respect to antibiotic therapy for MRSA and NVE, the IDSA 2011 guidelines recommend obtaining a clinical assessment to identify the source and extent of the infection. This includes the elimination and/or debridement of other sites of infection. Additional blood cultures should be obtained 2–4 days after initial positive cultures and as needed thereafter to document clearance of bacteremia.

### Frequency of susceptibility testing for patients with persistent methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia [^112GatQn]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2014). Low credibility.

Currently, no standards exist for determining the optimal frequency of repeat antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) when an organism is recurrently isolated from the same specimen source. Although testing every 2 to 5 days is thought sufficient, we present three cases of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bacteremia where laboratory protocol for repeating AST every 5 days was inadequate to identify resistant organisms.

### Daptomycin Plus Fosfomycin Versus Daptomycin Alone for Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus Bacteremia and Endocarditis: A Randomized Clinical Trial [^1139yWMx]. Clinical infectious diseases (2021). Low credibility.

(.)

Bacteremia due to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a major healthcare problem worldwide. Microbiological failures including persistent and reInfection remain a major problem in the management of patients with MRSA bacteremia and endocarditis. The persistently high mortality rate in MRSA bacteremia, ranging from 13% to 30%, is a matter of concern. A major factor contributing to these adverse outcomes is the limited efficacy of the Standard antibiotic therapy with either vancomycin or daptomycin.

Vancomycin is the agent for which the greatest cumulative clinical experience is available for the treatment of MRSA bacteremia and endocarditis. Compared to β-lactams, vancomycin has relatively slow bacterial killing, poor tissue penetration, and potential for toxicity, all of which may be responsible for the clinical failures reported. The use of vancomycin plus β-lactam therapy and adjunctive therapy with rifampicin to improve outcomes has proved unsatisfactory, providing little or no overall benefit over standard antibiotic therapy and increasing toxicity. In a significant randomized trial, daptomycin at a dose of 6 mg/kg once daily was not inferior to standard therapy for the treatment of S. aureus bacteremia and endocarditis. Nevertheless, the emergence of resistant strains and subsequent therapeutic failures using a once-daily dose of 6 mg/kg of daptomycin has led to the use of higher doses (8–10 mg/kg once daily) in some centers. Despite the use of high doses, treatment failures due to persistent or relapsing infections have been rep

### The utility of risk factors to define complicated Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia in a setting with low methicillin-resistant S. aureus prevalence [^111AgSEL]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). Low credibility.

The recommended duration of antibiotic treatment for Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia (SAB) is frequently based on distinguishing uncomplicated and complicated SAB; several risk factors at the onset of infection have been proposed to define complicated SAB. Predictive values of risk factors for complicated SAB have not been validated, and the consequences of their use on antibiotic prescriptions are unknown.

- **Methods**: In a prospective cohort, patients with SAB were categorized as complicated or uncomplicated through adjudication (reference definition). Associations and predictive values of nine risk factors were determined and compared with the reference definition. The accuracy of Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) criteria, which include four risk factors, and the projected consequences of applying IDSA criteria on antibiotic use, were also assessed.

- **Results**: Among 490 patients, 296 (60%) had complicated SAB. In multivariable analysis, persistent bacteremia (odds ratio [OR], 6.8; 95% confidence interval, 3.9–12.0), community acquisition of SAB (OR, 2.9; 95% CI, 1.9–4.7), and the presence of prosthetic material (OR, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.5–3.6) were associated with complicated SAB. The presence of any of the four risk factors in the IDSA definition of complicated SAB had a positive predictive value of 70.9% (95% CI, 65.5–75.9) and a negative predictive value of 57.5% (95% CI, 49.1–64.8). Compared with the reference, IDSA criteria yielded 24 (5%) false-negative and 90 (18%) false-positive classifications of complicated SAB. The median duration of antibiotic treatment for these 90 patients was 16 days.

There is debate on whether cefazolin or antistaphylococcal penicillins should be the first-line treatment for methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) bacteraemia. Ongoing trials are investigating whether cefazolin is non-inferior to (flu)cloxacillin, but it remains uncertain whether these findings apply to other antistaphylococcal penicillins.

- **Objectives**: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis comparing cefazolin with each of the individual antistaphylococcal penicillins for MSSA bacteraemia.

- **Methods**:
	- **Data sources**: We updated a 2019 systematic review but specifically focused on evaluating outcomes by individual antistaphylococcal penicillins.
	- **Study eligibility criteria**: Study eligibility criteria include comparative observational studies.
	- **Participants**: Participants include patients with MSSA bacteraemia.
	- **Interventions**: Interventions include cefazolin vs. the antistaphylococcal penicillins.
	- **Assessment of risk of bias**: Assessment of risk of bias involved the risk of bias in non-randomized studies of interventions tool.
	- **Methods of data synthesis**: The primary outcome was 30-day all-cause mortality, and we assessed for non-inferiority of cefazolin using a pre-specified non-inferiority margin of a pooled OR < 1.2 using raw unadjusted data. Secondary outcomes were 90-day mortality, treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs), discontinuation due to toxicity, and nephrotoxicity.

- **Results**: No randomized data have been published. A total of 30 observational studies at moderate or high risk of bias were included, which comprised 3869 patients.

### Management of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia [^113Aray5]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia and endocarditis are serious infections that demand prompt clinical attention to ensure good outcomes. Of foremost importance is identifying and managing the source of infection and any associated complications. Evaluation for the presence of cardiac involvement is essential because inadequately managed S. aureus endocarditis is life-threatening. Thus, physicians must aggressively negotiate treatment paths, considering whether the S. aureus bacteremia is complicated, whether foreign sources of infection should be removed or replaced, and whether surgical intervention is necessary. Selection of an antibiotic treatment is also an essential factor for optimal management. The increasing prevalence of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) infections has created a tremendous demand for effective and safe antimicrobial agents other than the historic anti-MRSA agent vancomycin.

### Dicloxacillin sodium [^115EY61x]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Prescribing dicloxacillin sodium capsules without the presence of a confirmed or strongly suspected bacterial infection, or a prophylactic indication, is unlikely to benefit the patient and increases the risk of drug-resistant bacteria development.

Dicloxacillin should generally not be administered to patients with a history of sensitivity to any penicillin. Penicillin should be used with caution in individuals with histories of significant allergies and/or asthma.

There is clinical and laboratory evidence of partial cross-allergenicity among penicillins and other β-lactam antibiotics, including cephalosporins, cephamycins, and other 1-oxa-β-lactams. Whenever allergic reactions occur, penicillin should be withdrawn unless, in the opinion of the physician, the condition being treated is life-threatening and amenable only to penicillin therapy.

The oral route of administration should not be relied upon in patients with severe illness, or with nausea, vomiting, gastric dilatation, cardiospasm, or intestinal hypermotility. Occasionally, patients may not absorb therapeutic amounts of orally administered penicillin.

### Improving the management of Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia, including MRSA [^1155cCbY]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2013). Low credibility.

Staphylococcus aureus is a common cause of both community and hospital-acquired bacteraemia and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The management of Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia is multi-faceted. It often requires prolonged courses of antimicrobial therapy as well as a thorough assessment and investigations to identify the source and seek any complications, such as metastatic foci.

Given the meticulous approach required when treating patients with S. aureus bacteraemia, there is potential for some aspects of optimal management to be missed, especially in an environment where time and bed space are at a premium. However, failure of any aspect of the optimal management is associated with negative patient outcomes.

### Daptomycin [^114Fo532]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

A total of 246 patients aged 18 years or older (124 received daptomycin for injection, 122 received a comparator) with S. aureus bacteremia were randomized from 48 centers in the US and Europe. In the intent-to-treat (ITT) population, 120 patients received daptomycin for injection and 115 received a comparator; 62 received an anti-staphylococcal semi-synthetic penicillin, and 53 received vancomycin. Thirty-five patients initially treated with an anti-staphylococcal semi-synthetic penicillin received vancomycin for 1 to 3 days, pending final susceptibility results of the S. aureus isolates.

The median age among the 235 patients in the ITT population was 53 years, ranging from 21 to 91 years. In the daptomycin for injection group, 30 out of 120 (25%) patients were 65 years or older, while in the comparator group, 37 out of 115 (32%) patients were 65 years or older. Of the 235 ITT patients, 141 (60%) were male, and 156 (66%) were Caucasian across the two treatment groups.

Additionally, 176 (75%) of the ITT population had systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) at baseline, and 85 (36%) had undergone surgical procedures within 30 days prior to the onset of the S. aureus bacteremia. Eighty-nine patients (38%) had bacteremia caused by methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). Entry diagnosis was based on the modified Duke criteria, comprising 37 (16%) with definite endocarditis, 144 (61%) with possible endocarditis, and 54 (23%) with not endocarditis. Of the 37 patients with a definite endocarditis entry diagnosis, all (100%) had a final diagnosis of infective endocarditis. Among the 144 patients with a possible endocarditis entry diagnosis, 15 (10%) ultimately had a final diagnosis of infective endocarditis, as assessed by the adjudication committee.

### Management of Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia: A review [^115srBTr]. JAMA (2025). High credibility.

Staphylococcus aureus, a gram-positive bacterium, is the leading cause of death from bacteremia worldwide, with a case fatality rate of 15% to 30% and an estimated 300,000 deaths per year.

- **Observations**: Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia causes metastatic infection in more than one-third of cases, including endocarditis (≈12%), septic arthritis (7%), vertebral osteomyelitis (≈4%), spinal epidural abscess, psoas abscess, splenic abscess, septic pulmonary emboli, and seeding of implantable medical devices.

Patients with S. aureus bacteremia commonly present with fever or symptoms from metastatic infection, such as pain in the back, joints, abdomen or extremities, and/or change in mental status. Risk factors include intravascular devices such as implantable cardiac devices and dialysis vascular catheters, recent surgical procedures, injection drug use, diabetes, and previous S. aureus infection. Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia is detected with blood cultures. Prolonged S. aureus bacteremia (≥ 48 hours) is associated with a 90-day mortality risk of 39%.

All patients with S. aureus bacteremia should undergo transthoracic echocardiography; transesophageal echocardiography should be performed in patients at high risk for endocarditis, such as those with persistent bacteremia, persistent fever, metastatic infection foci, or implantable cardiac devices. Other imaging modalities, such as computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging, should be performed based on symptoms and localizing signs of metastatic infection.

Staphylococcus aureus is categorized as methicillin-susceptible or methicillin-resistant.

### Antimicrobial resistance as risk factor for recurrent bacteremia after Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, or Klebsiella spp. community-onset bacteremia [^113EmfUr]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2024). Low credibility.

- **Antimicrobial resistance**: Isolation of MRSA in incident bacteremia episodes did not affect the incidence of recurrence (HR 0.79 [95% CI 0.29–2.19]; referent MSSA). Conversely, isolation of 3GC-resistant E. coli (HR 2.02 [95% CI 1.41–2.91]; referent 3GC-susceptible E. coli) or 3GC-resistant Klebsiella spp. (HR 2.77 [95% CI 1.60–4.79]; referent 3GC-susceptible Klebsiella spp.) was associated with an increased risk for recurrence. Cumulative incidence function curves of recurrence over time (Figure 2) show the differential effect of bacteria-resistance pairs on risk for recurrence, which was highest for 3GC-resistant Klebsiella spp. These results were similar in an analysis stratified by bacterial species and in the multivariable logistic regression model.

- **Sensitivity analysis**: A sensitivity analysis considering only stays (36%) with information on empirical treatment showed comparable results, with a higher HR for 3GC-resistant Klebsiella spp. and no effect of adequacy of empirical treatment on recurrence risk.

The subdistribution HRs for the relationship between each bacteria-resistance pair and recurrence of bacteremia at 1 year in the final multivariable model, by reference, are detailed in a study of community-onset bacteremia attributable to Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, or Klebsiella spp. These findings were derived from the Assistance Publique–Hôpitaux de Paris university hospital group, Paris, France, between 2017 and 2019. Results are adjusted based on all the variables described in Table 2, where 3GC represents third-generation cephalosporin, and HR stands for subdistribution hazard ratio.

### National guidelines for the control and prevention of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus — what do they tell us [^115yg3Ws]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2007). Low credibility.

Guidelines to control and prevent methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection are available in many countries. Infection control and prevention teams determine local strategies using such national guidelines. However, not all guidelines involve a rigorous assessment of the literature to determine the strength of the recommendations. Available guidelines drafted by national agencies or prominent professional organizations in Germany, New Zealand, North America, the Netherlands, Ireland, and the UK were reviewed. Significant literature reviews were a component of guidelines from the UK and North America. In contrast, recommendations were not graded on the strength of the evidence in guidelines from New Zealand and the Netherlands.

The Netherlands, a country with a very low prevalence of MRSA, had the simplest set of guidelines. Few of the recommendations in any of the guidelines achieved the highest grading, which involves well-designed experimental, clinical, or epidemiological studies, even though the logic of the proposed measures is clear. The onset of community-acquired MRSA is reflected in the recent publication of guidelines from North America. New developments, such as rapid testing and mathematical modeling, are important in helping to control MRSA in settings of both low and high endemicity. National guidelines are increasingly evidence-based, although good scientific studies concerning some aspects of MRSA control are lacking. However, general principles, such as early detection and isolation, are recommended by all guidelines. There is still a role for consensus.

### Clinical practice guidelines by the infectious diseases society of america for the treatment of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections in adults and children: executive summary [^114D2QMm]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2011). High credibility.

Evidence-based guidelines for the management of patients with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections were prepared by an Expert Panel of the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA). The guidelines are intended for use by healthcare providers who care for adult and pediatric patients with MRSA infections. The guidelines discuss the management of a variety of clinical syndromes associated with MRSA disease, including skin and soft tissue infections (SSTI), bacteremia and endocarditis, pneumonia, bone and joint infections, and central nervous system (CNS) infections. Recommendations are provided regarding vancomycin dosing and monitoring, management of infections due to MRSA strains with reduced susceptibility to vancomycin, and vancomycin treatment failures.

### Daptomycin versus standard therapy for bacteremia and endocarditis caused by Staphylococcus aureus [^112qw5nQ]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Alternative therapies for Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia and endocarditis are needed.

- **Methods**: We randomly assigned 124 patients with S. aureus bacteremia, with or without endocarditis, to receive 6 mg of daptomycin intravenously per kilogram of body weight daily; 122 were assigned to receive initial low-dose gentamicin plus either an antistaphylococcal penicillin or vancomycin. The primary efficacy endpoint was treatment success 42 days after the end of therapy.

- **Results**: Forty-two days after the end of therapy in the modified intention-to-treat analysis, a successful outcome was documented for 53 of 120 patients who received daptomycin compared with 48 of 115 patients who received standard therapy (44.2 percent vs. 41.7 percent; absolute difference, 2.4 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, -10.2 to 15.1 percent). Our results met prespecified criteria for the noninferiority of daptomycin. The success rates were similar in subgroups of patients with complicated bacteremia, right-sided endocarditis, and methicillin-resistant S. aureus. Daptomycin therapy was associated with a higher rate of microbiological failure than standard therapy (19 vs. 11 patients, P = 0.17). In 6 of the 19 patients with microbiological failure in the daptomycin group, isolates with reduced susceptibility to daptomycin emerged. Similarly, a reduced susceptibility to vancomycin was noted in isolates from patients treated with vancomycin. Compared with daptomycin therapy, standard therapy was associated with a nonsignificantly higher rate of adverse events that led to treatment failure.

### How I manage a patient with MRSA bacteraemia [^116McRrj]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2022). Low credibility.

Staphylococcus aureus bloodstream infections are common and associated with a high mortality of 15–25%. Methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) bloodstream infection accounts for 10–40% of cases and has an even higher mortality. Despite being the 'bread and butter' of clinical infectious diseases practice, robust evidence to guide optimal management is often lacking, and there is wide variation in practice.

- **Objectives**: To provide a real-world example of a case of MRSA bacteraemia and the thought processes of the authors as key management decision points are reached.

- **Sources**: The discussion is based on recent literature searches of relevant topics. In making recommendations, randomized clinical trial data have been prioritized and highlighted, and where these are not available, recommendations are based on the experience and opinions of the authors.

- **Content**: For a patient with MRSA bacteraemia and a primary bone and joint infection, the following points are discussed: empirical antibiotic choice for suspected S. aureus bacteraemia; directed antibiotic choice for MRSA; monitoring and dosing of vancomycin; the role of combination therapy when bacteraemia is persistent; and the duration of therapy and role of switching to oral antibiotics.

- **Implications**: While broad principles of aggressive source control and appropriate choice and duration of antibiotics are important, the heterogeneity of S. aureus bacteraemia means that a tailored rather than algorithmic approach to management is often required. Further randomized controlled trials are needed to strengthen the evidence base for treatment strategies.

### Management of patients with a history of allergy to beta-lactam antibiotics [^117LPCsj]. The American Journal of Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Patients with a history of penicillin allergy pose a treatment dilemma. The unnecessary avoidance of this relatively nontoxic class of drugs exposes the patient to potentially more toxic drugs, increases healthcare costs, and contributes to the development of antibiotic resistance. Yet, for those who truly have an allergy or other serious adverse reactions to beta-lactams, the use of alternate drugs is a must. This article reviews management strategies to determine which patients are good candidates for the reintroduction of beta-lactams and which patients should continue avoidance.

### Daptomycin therapy failure in an adolescent with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia [^1174FjS9]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2009). Low credibility.

Daptomycin is a Food and Drug Administration-approved alternative to vancomycin for the treatment of serious methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections in adults. Although treatment failure with daptomycin is increasingly reported in adults, data in children are limited. We report an adolescent patient with severe burn injuries who had persistent methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia and rapidly developed nonsusceptibility to daptomycin. We also review the relevant literature.

### In MRSA bacteremia, adding a β-lactam to usual care did not improve a composite outcome at 90 days [^11793oqq]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2020). High credibility.

In a randomized clinical trial, the effect of adding either vancomycin or daptomycin to usual care, with or without an antistaphylococcal β-lactam, was examined in patients with MRSA bacteremia. The study aimed to assess outcomes such as mortality, bacteremia, relapse, or treatment failure within a 90-day period. The trial findings indicate that there was no significant improvement in the composite outcome at 90 days when a β-lactam was added to the usual care.

### The need for new therapeutic agents: What is the pipeline [^116rCuAg]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2005). High credibility.

There is a clinical need for new treatment options for serious Gram-positive infections. Recently introduced agents, such as the newer fluoroquinolones and the ketolide telithromycin, have limited use as they do not cover methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) or glycopeptide-resistant enterococci (GRE). The clinical use of the streptogramin combination quinupristin/dalfopristin, which has activity against MRSA and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium, is limited due to administration requirements involving a slow infusion of a large volume.

The oxazolidinone linezolid is active against MRSA and GRE; however, resistant organisms and treatment failures have been reported. Various compounds currently in development show promise, including the new glycopeptides oritavancin, dalbavancin, and the glycolipodepsipeptide ramoplanin, as well as the new tetracyclines tigecycline and BAY73–7388. In some cases, there is concern that resistance may develop quickly to new compounds that are based on existing antimicrobial agents.

Daptomycin, a novel lipopeptide with a unique mode of action, is of particular interest. It is active against MRSA, including vancomycin-resistant strains, and GRE. Daptomycin displays rapid concentration-dependent killing and is bactericidal even in the stationary phase of growth. Daptomycin-resistant strains are very difficult to generate in vitro. A dosage of 4 mg/kg intravenously once a day has been shown to be efficacious in two evaluator-blinded trials of complicated skin and soft tissue infections, with clinical success rates similar for daptomycin.

### 2023 ESC guidelines for the management of endocarditis [^111C3TfD]. European Heart Journal (2023). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of infective endocarditis, particularly concerning antibiotic therapy for MRSA and prosthetic valve endocarditis (PVE), the ESC 2023 guidelines recommend administering vancomycin with rifampin for at least six weeks and gentamicin for two weeks. The following doses are advised for adult patients with PVE caused by methicillin-resistant staphylococci:

| **Situation** | **Guidance** |
|-|-|
| Vancomycin | 30–60 mg/kg/day IV in 2–3 doses |
| Rifampin | 900–1,200 mg/day IV or PO in 2–3 divided doses|
| Gentamicin | 3 mg/kg/day IV or IM in 1 (preferred) or 2 doses|

### Potential role for telavancin in bacteremic infections due to gram-positive pathogens: Focus on Staphylococcus aureus [^11291DFi]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Clinical experience in the treatment of Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia or infective endocarditis has been explored in the ASSURE study. This phase 2, multinational, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled trial evaluated the safety and efficacy of telavancin for the treatment of adult patients with uncomplicated S. aureus bacteremia (SAB). Patients were randomized to receive either telavancin (10 mg/kg IV q24h) or standard therapy (vancomycin 1 g IV q12h or antistaphylococcal penicillin [nafcillin 2 g IV q6h, oxacillin 2 g IV q6h, or cloxacillin 2 g IV q6h]) for 14 days. Blinded dose adjustment of vancomycin was permitted per site-specific guidelines.

The primary efficacy endpoint was clinical cure at day 84, defined as the resolution of clinical symptoms/signs associated with bacteremia, no evidence of metastatic complications, all cultures negative for S. aureus after qualifying blood cultures, and no non-study systemic antistaphylococcal medication to which the baseline pathogen was susceptible.

Of the 60 patients randomized to telavancin or standard therapy, 58 received one or more doses of study medication (n = 29 in each group). The key analysis populations included:

- **All-treated target population (ATT)**: Patients who received one or more doses of study medication and fulfilled inclusion/exclusion and continuation criteria [telavancin, n = 15; standard therapy, n = 16].
- **Clinically evaluable population**: Patients in the ATT population who received 12–16 days of study medication and whose participation did not deviate from the protocol by more than pre-specified limits [telavancin, 8; standard therapy].

### Optimal vancomycin AUC target in pediatric MRSA bacteremia: A Bayesian-guided approach [^115w7nNq]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2025). Low credibility.

Vancomycin is the most commonly used drug for treating methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections. The parameter associated with its therapeutic efficacy is the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) divided by the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). However, due to difficulties in directly measuring AUC, trough concentration (C trough) monitoring has been employed as a surrogate marker since 2009. Nonetheless, several studies have indicated that C trough does not consistently reflect AUC values and lacks a significant correlation with outcomes. Moreover, a meta-analysis suggested that AUC monitoring may reduce the incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI) compared with C trough measurement. The 2020 revised vancomycin therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) guidelines recommend AUC monitoring and suggest using Bayesian software to estimate AUC. Bayesian-derived TDM can easily estimate AUC using the vancomycin population pharmacokinetic model and individual patient data.

Previous studies on adults with severe MRSA infections have recommended an AUC/MIC ≥ 400 mg·h/L as a therapeutic target, despite variations in AUC estimation methods and the inherent limitations of retrospective studies. Given the differences in clinical severity, prognosis, and physiological responses to vancomycin in pediatric patients with MRSA bacteremia compared with adults, it remains uncertain whether the AUC/MIC target recommended for adults can be directly extrapolated to the pediatric population. Two retrospective pediatric studies, in which the AUC was calculated using Bayesian estimations, have been conducted.

### Dapzura RT [^116dADLg]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

Overall, there was no difference in time to clearance of S. aureus bacteremia between daptomycin for injection and the comparator. The median time to clearance in patients with MSSA was 4 days and in patients with MRSA was 8 days.

Failure of treatment due to persisting or relapsing S. aureus infections was assessed by the Adjudication Committee in 19 out of 120 (16%) daptomycin for injection-treated patients (12 with MRSA and 7 with MSSA) and 11 out of 115 (10%) comparator-treated patients (9 with MRSA treated with vancomycin and 2 with MSSA treated with an anti-staphylococcal semi-synthetic penicillin). Among all failures, isolates from 6 daptomycin for injection-treated patients and 1 vancomycin-treated patient developed increasing MICs (reduced susceptibility) by central laboratory testing during or following therapy. Most patients who failed due to persisting or relapsing S. aureus infection had deep-seated infection and did not receive necessary surgical intervention [see Warnings and precautions (5.9)].

- **Pediatric patients (1 to 17 years of age) with S. aureus bacteremia**: The pediatric S. aureus bacteremia study was designed as a prospective multi-center, randomized, comparative trial to treat pediatric patients aged 1 to 17 years with bacteremia. Patients known to have endocarditis or pneumonia at baseline were excluded. Patients were enrolled in a stepwise approach into three age groups and given age-dependent doses of daptomycin for injection once daily for up to 42 days. The different age groups and doses evaluated were as follows: Adolescents (12 to 17 years, n = 14 patients).

Regarding medical management for catheter-related bloodstream infection, more specifically concerning empiric antibiotic therapy, the IDSA 2009 guidelines recommend administering vancomycin for empirical therapy in healthcare settings with an elevated prevalence of MRSA. They suggest administering alternative agents such as daptomycin in institutions where the preponderance of MRSA isolates have vancomycin MIC values greater than 2 mcg/mL.

### Potential role for telavancin in bacteremic infections due to gram-positive pathogens: Focus on Staphylococcus aureus [^113T8WAh]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

The efficacy of telavancin has been studied in animal infection models of bacteremia and infective endocarditis caused by clinically relevant gram-positive organisms. In these studies, telavancin efficacy was compared with that of agents such as vancomycin or daptomycin at doses that mimicked human-equivalent exposures. The following are a few illustrative examples.

In several murine bacteremic infection models, telavancin treatment resulted in the successful resolution of an MRSA infection, whereas vancomycin treatment did not. Telavancin also produced significantly greater reductions in blood and spleen bacterial titers (P < 0.05) compared to vancomycin. The mortality rate on day 14 was lower with telavancin than with vancomycin or controls (1/15 [7%], 15/15 [100%], and 15/15 [100%], respectively). In an immunocompromised murine model of bacteremia caused by glycopeptide intermediate S. aureus (strains HIP-5836 and Mu50) or hVISA (strain Mu3), telavancin was more effective than vancomycin, despite only 24 hours of dosing. Moreover, only telavancin produced statistically significant (P < 0.05) and sustained reductions in blood and spleen titers from pretreatment levels for all three strains tested.

The effects of telavancin and vancomycin on spleen and blood bacterial titers in a murine methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia model highlighted this efficacy. For controls at all time points except at t = 10 hours (n = 9) and t = 16 hours (n = 4), the sample size was n = 10. The vancomycin group experienced similar control issues across time points.

### New agents for Staphylococcus aureus endocarditis [^11355zBb]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

The increasing prevalence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), as well as newly discovered S. aureus strains with reduced susceptibility to vancomycin, mandates the development of new antistaphylococcal agents. This review summarizes currently available and forthcoming antimicrobials for the treatment of S. aureus endocarditis.

Recent findings indicate that no new antimicrobial has been proven superior to antistaphylococcal penicillins for the treatment of methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA) endocarditis. Vancomycin has become the standard treatment for MRSA, but poor outcomes have been reported, both with susceptible and intermediately resistant S. aureus strains (VISA). Linezolid has successfully treated individual cases of MRSA endocarditis; however, limitations include concerns regarding long-term safety. Daptomycin has recently been proven effective and well-tolerated for MSSA and MRSA bacteremia, including right-sided endocarditis. New glycopeptides, such as dalbavancin and telavancin, as well as the new cephalosporin ceftobiprole, have not yet been studied for the treatment of endocarditis, but they appear active against MRSA and potentially VISA.

Antistaphylococcal penicillins remain the treatment of choice for MSSA. Of the currently available newer agents, daptomycin appears to have the most rapid bactericidal activity and provides a much-needed alternative to vancomycin for the treatment of MRSA or MSSA bacteremia and right-sided endocarditis.

### Practice patterns of providers for the management of Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia in children: Results of an Emerging Infections Network survey [^115R9Mez]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2018). Low credibility.

- **Persistent methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia**: For the treatment of children with persistent MRSA bacteremia despite adequate vancomycin levels, 37% continue vancomycin and add a second agent, most commonly rifampin. A minority (12%) continue vancomycin monotherapy, whereas 43% change to other agents, most commonly daptomycin; 8% of providers chose an alternative management strategy.

- **Peripherally inserted central catheter-associated thrombus with Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia**: There was no consensus on the duration of IV therapy for children with PICC-associated thrombus and bacteremia; 34% treated for 2 weeks, 37% treated for 4 weeks, 18% treated for 6 weeks, and 11% chose an alternative treatment strategy. The majority (71%) recommend anticoagulation.

### Daptomycin plus fosfomycin versus daptomycin alone for methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus bacteremia and endocarditis: A randomized clinical trial [^112ukX7e]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). High credibility.

The primary endpoint was treatment success at the test of cure (TOC), occurring six weeks after the end of treatment (EOT). Treatment success was defined as the patient being alive and having resolution of clinical manifestations of infection with negative blood cultures at TOC after completion of therapy. Treatment failure was considered in any of the following situations: lack of clinical improvement at day 3 or later after the start of therapy, persistent MRSA bacteremia at day 7 or later, premature discontinuation of therapy due to adverse events (AEs) or clinical judgment, recurrence of MRSA bacteremia before or at TOC, additional antimicrobial therapy active against MRSA administered before TOC, lack of blood cultures obtained at TOC, and/or death due to any cause before TOC. Only patients without treatment failure could have treatment success. For analysis purposes, patients lost to follow-up (with missing TOC data) were classified as having treatment failure.

- **Secondary endpoints**: The secondary endpoints included MRSA bacteremia at day 3, day 7, and/or at TOC; microbiological failure; complicated bacteremia; AEs leading to treatment discontinuation; and mortality due to any cause at day 7 and at TOC. Microbiological failure was considered in cases of persistent bacteremia, recurrence of bacteremia, and the emergence of resistance to study drugs during treatment.

Primary and secondary endpoints were assessed by study investigators in the modified intention-to-treat population. A systematic, prioritized, risk-based approach to monitor AEs was developed to ensure that the trial was conducted, recorded, and reported according to protocol.

### Combination therapy with lysin CF-301 and antibiotic is superior to antibiotic alone for treating methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus-induced murine bacteremia [^116TJPRx]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

To test the robustness of combination therapy, the bacterial inoculum was increased to a point where high doses of SOC antibiotics were minimally efficacious. In this high-challenge model, mice were inoculated intraperitoneally with 1 × 10⁹ CFU of MRSA MW2, MRSA CFS738, or MRSA CFS832 and treated 2 hours later with CF-301, daptomycin, or a combination of both. At 72 hours, treatment with CF-301 alone resulted in 17%–50% survival, whereas treatment with daptomycin alone resulted in 7%–31% survival. In contrast to these single-drug treatments, the combination of CF-301 with daptomycin improved survival to 82%–90% (P < .0001).

In another high-challenge study, mice were inoculated with MRSA MW2 and treated 2 hours later with CF-301, vancomycin, or a combination of CF-301 with vancomycin. At 72 hours, treatment with either CF-301 or vancomycin alone resulted in 3% survival. The combination of CF-301 with vancomycin improved survival to 67% (P < .0001).

A high-challenge study was also performed with MSSA CFS544. Mice were inoculated intraperitoneally with 10⁹ CFU and treated 2 hours later with CF-301, oxacillin, or a combination of CF-301 with oxacillin. At 72 hours, treatment with either CF-301 or oxacillin alone resulted in 3% survival. In contrast, treatment with the combination of CF-301 and oxacillin improved survival to 30% (P < .0001).

Similar enhanced activities of combinations were observed in 10 additional MRSA-induced bacteremia experiments, together with the 16 individual experiments used to compile the graphs shown.

### Penicillin allergy in pregnancy: Moving from "rash" decisions to accurate diagnosis [^113uQLaw]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). Low credibility.

The emergence of beta-lactam-resistant pathogenic organisms has necessitated the limitation or even elimination of drugs such as penicillin and ampicillin from the available antibiotic choices for treating common infections in obstetrics and gynecology. In clinical situations where penicillins and cephalosporins are appropriate or recommended as first-line agents, the issue of patient-reported penicillin allergies has led to the routine use of alternative but potentially less effective agents.

Use of broader-spectrum and potentially suboptimal alternative antibiotic regimens for intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis against group B streptococcus or for surgical prophylaxis for cesarean delivery in women with a reported penicillin allergy may adversely affect these women during labor and birth. Most individuals who report a penicillin allergy are neither truly allergic nor at risk of developing a hypersensitivity reaction after exposure to penicillin.

The available evidence suggests that there are important roles for both targeted history-taking to determine the nature of drug allergies and penicillin allergy testing in pregnant women, to optimize their antibiotic-related treatment both during pregnancy and for their lifetimes. Wider consideration and adoption of penicillin allergy testing in pregnant women specifically, as well as in the general population of women cared for by providers of obstetrics and gynecology, is recommended.

### Bacteremia due to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus: New therapeutic approaches [^1156vTRT]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

This article reviews recent clinical evidence for the treatment of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bacteremia. Vancomycin remains the initial antibiotic of choice for the treatment of patients with MRSA bacteremia and endocarditis when dealing with isolates having a vancomycin minimum inhibitory concentration of ≤ 2 μg/mL, whereas daptomycin is an effective alternative, and ceftaroline appears promising. Treatment options for persistent MRSA bacteremia or bacteremia due to vancomycin-intermediate or vancomycin-resistant strains include daptomycin, ceftaroline, and combination therapies. There is a critical need for high-level evidence from clinical trials to allow for optimally informed decisions in the treatment of MRSA bacteremia and endocarditis.

### The role of vancomycin in the treatment paradigm [^114Lf1o8]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Vancomycin was introduced in the United States in 1956 as a possible treatment for infections due to penicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, but it was not widely used because of toxicity and the nearly simultaneous development of semisynthetic antibiotics and cephalosporins. Thus, its main indication was the treatment of serious gram-positive infections in penicillin-allergic patients. For susceptible strains of S. aureus, vancomycin was more rapidly bactericidal than penicillin, nafcillin, or cefazolin. In a rabbit model of S. aureus endocarditis, sterilization of vegetations was more rapid with vancomycin.

In clinical practice, however, nafcillin remained the treatment of choice for staphylococcal bacteremia, largely because it had failure rates of only 4%. With the appearance of methicillin-resistant S. aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci, vancomycin became the drug of choice for these infections. Recently, the efficacy of vancomycin has been questioned because of its increasing minimum inhibitory concentrations among staphylococci, poor tissue penetration, and apparently slower bacterial killing than was previously recognized.

### Staphylococcus aureus bloodstream infections: Definitions and treatment [^111sDnDT]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

Bacteremia caused by Staphylococcus aureus is a serious infection associated with high morbidity and mortality. It often results in metastatic infections, such as infective endocarditis, which negatively impact patient outcomes. This review emphasizes the importance of precise definitions of uncomplicated and complicated bacteremia. A case study is presented to highlight the need for prolonged treatment and close monitoring of patients with risk factors for complications associated with S. aureus bacteremia.

Traditionally, the treatment choice for S. aureus bacteremia has depended largely on the methicillin susceptibility of the pathogen. New antibiotics, effective against both susceptible and resistant strains, are particularly attractive for empirical therapy. The antimicrobial agents currently available for treating both methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant S. aureus bacteremia are reviewed. The scientific evidence supporting the use of these agents for this indication is also examined.

### Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole versus vancomycin for severe infections caused by meticillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus: randomised controlled trial [^1113MbZX]. BMJ (2015). High credibility.

The main treatment options for MRSA infections, aside from vancomycin (or teicoplanin) and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, include linezolid, tedizolid, telavancin, dalbavancin, oritavancin, daptomycin, tigecycline, and ceftaroline. Most of these new antibiotics were evaluated for the treatment of skin and soft tissue infections in randomised controlled trials. Mortality was rarely assessed in these trials and, when reported, was very low (usually < 1%).

Few randomised controlled trials targeted infections other than skin and soft tissue infections, and most did not focus solely on MRSA. Daptomycin was found to be non-inferior to standard therapy in a randomised controlled trial that included 245 patients with S. aureus bacteraemia, 89 of whom had MRSA bacteraemia and were treated with daptomycin or vancomycin. The overall mortality was 11%.

- **Similar efficacy and safety**: Linezolid and vancomycin demonstrated similar efficacy and safety in nosocomial pneumonia, with a mortality rate of 14% in these trials.

- **Non-inferiority studies**:
	- Tigecycline was non-inferior to vancomycin in a randomised controlled trial of 156 patients with invasive MRSA infections. Most of these were skin and soft tissue infections, with a mortality rate of 5%.
	- Telavancin was non-inferior to vancomycin in hospital-acquired pneumonia (293 patients with MRSA, overall mortality in the study was 19%).

Compared to these trials, ours included a larger group of patients with MRSA bacteraemia and a sicker cohort overall, as indicated by the mortality rates. This more closely reflects the patient population treated for MRSA infections in clinical practice.

- **Limitations of the study**: The main limitation of our trial is the.

### Recommendations for systemic antimicrobial therapy in fracture-related infection: A consensus from an international expert group [^116iymDt]. Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma (2020). Low credibility.

- **Staphylococcus aureus**: In methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), intravenous (IV) flucloxacillin is the initial first choice. Garzoni et al. studied the interactions of continuous flucloxacillin and oral rifampicin in 15 patients. The combination with rifampicin increased flucloxacillin levels by 44.5%; however, in monotherapy, the plasma-free drug level of flucloxacillin also exceeded the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) for S. aureus by several folds. In other studies, a lowered serum level of flucloxacillin was observed. The expert group recommends a dose of 2 g of flucloxacillin every 6 hours. When S. aureus is methicillin-resistant (MRSA), IV vancomycin is recommended initially. Careful monitoring for nephrotoxicity is essential, with therapeutic serum values between 15 and 20 mg/L. However, both glycopeptides (vancomycin and teicoplanin) and daptomycin demonstrate low cure rates when given as monotherapy in experimental implant-associated infections. In cases of vancomycin allergy, daptomycin can be considered.

- **Coagulase-negative staphylococci**: Coagulase-negative staphylococci such as Staphylococcus epidermidis are treated like MRSA if they are methicillin-resistant (MRSE). Methicillin susceptibility testing may be difficult in some strains. Expression of resistance is affected by test conditions, and resistance is often heterogeneous, with only a proportion of cells showing resistance. If mecA is absent, strains can be treated as for MSSA.

### De-escalation of empiric antibiotics following negative cultures in hospitalized patients with pneumonia: Rates and outcomes [^114ebnN5]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Low credibility.

For patients at risk for multidrug-resistant organisms, IDSA/ATS guidelines recommend empiric therapy against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Pseudomonas. Following negative cultures, the guidelines recommend antimicrobial de-escalation. We assessed antibiotic de-escalation practices across hospitals and their associations with outcomes in hospitalized patients with pneumonia with negative cultures.

- **Methods**: We included adults admitted with pneumonia in 2010–2015 to 164 US hospitals if they had negative blood and/or respiratory cultures and received both anti-MRSA and antipseudomonal agents other than quinolones. De-escalation was defined as stopping both empiric drugs on day 4 while continuing another antibiotic. Patients were propensity adjusted for de-escalation and compared on in-hospital 14-day mortality, late deterioration (ICU transfer), length-of-stay (LOS), and costs. We also compared adjusted outcomes across hospital de-escalation rate quartiles.

- **Results**: Of 14,170 patients, 1,924 (13%) had both initial empiric drugs stopped by hospital day 4. Hospital de-escalation rates ranged from 2–35%, and hospital de-escalation rate quartile was not significantly associated with outcomes. At hospitals in the top quartile of de-escalation, even among patients at lowest risk for mortality, the de-escalation rates were < 50%. In propensity-adjusted analysis, patients with de-escalation had lower odds of subsequent transfer to ICU (adjusted odds ratio, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.18–0.79), LOS (adjusted ratio of means, 0.76; 0.75–0.78), and costs (0.74; 0.72–0.76).

Regarding medical management for surgical site infection, more specifically with respect to antibiotic therapy, choice of agent, the IDSA 2014 guidelines recommend administering vancomycin, linezolid, daptomycin, telavancin, or ceftaroline. These recommendations apply to patients at high risk of MRSA, such as those with nasal MRSA colonization, prior MRSA infection, recent hospitalization, or recent antibiotic use.

### Current treatment options for acute skin and skin-structure infections [^117MdSXz]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Low credibility.

The emergence of community-associated MRSA strains has greatly influenced the selection of empirical antibiotic therapy for ABSSSIs. To provide adequate empirical coverage for MRSA, an understanding of local microbial epidemiologic patterns and susceptibility patterns is essential. For the treatment of an abscess, the IDSA guidelines recommend, in addition to incision and drainage, the administration of an antibiotic active against MRSA when the initial antibiotic treatment has failed or when the patient has immunosuppression, systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), or hypotension.

For cellulitis and erysipelas, including an antibiotic with activity against MRSA and group A streptococcus is recommended when the infection is associated with penetrating trauma, or when there is evidence of MRSA infection, MRSA colonization, injecting drug use, or SIRS. Furthermore, including an antimicrobial agent active against MRSA in the treatment of surgical wound infections is recommended in patients with risk factors for infection by this microorganism (such as nasal colonization, prior infection, hospitalization, or recent antibiotic administration).

Anti-MRSA agents for ABSSSIs include vancomycin, which is considered the first-line parenteral treatment for serious MRSA infections in hospitalized patients, as well as linezolid, daptomycin, and tigecycline. Other agents with reliable MRSA activity that have been approved for ABSSSIs include ceftaroline, tedizolid, and dalb.

### Combination of vancomycin and β-lactam therapy for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia: A pilot multicenter randomized controlled trial [^113dWDie]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). High credibility.

In vitro laboratory and animal studies demonstrate a synergistic role for the combination of vancomycin and antistaphylococcal β-lactams for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bacteremia; however, prospective clinical data are lacking.

- **Methods**: In this open-label, multicenter clinical trial, adults with MRSA bacteremia received vancomycin 1.5 g intravenously twice daily and were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive intravenous flucloxacillin 2 g every 6 hours for 7 days (combination group) or no additional therapy (standard therapy group). Participants were stratified by hospital and randomized in permuted blocks of variable size. Randomization codes were kept in sealed, sequentially numbered, opaque envelopes. The primary outcome was the duration of MRSA bacteremia in days.

- **Results**: We randomly assigned 60 patients to receive vancomycin (n = 29) or vancomycin plus flucloxacillin (n = 31). The mean duration of bacteremia was 3.00 days in the standard therapy group and 1.94 days in the combination group. According to a negative binomial model, the mean time to resolution of bacteremia in the combination group was 65% (95% confidence interval, 41%-102%; p = 0.06) that in the standard therapy group. There was no difference in the secondary endpoints of 28- and 90-day mortality, metastatic infection, nephrotoxicity, or hepatotoxicity.

- **Conclusions**: Combining an antistaphylococcal β-lactam with vancomycin may shorten the duration of MRSA bacteremia. Further trials with a larger sample size and objective clinically relevant endpoints are warranted.

### Current paradigms of combination therapy in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bacteremia: Does it work, which combination, and for which patients [^113pZkPC]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Low credibility.

The last several years have seen an emergence of literature documenting the utility of combination antimicrobial therapy, particularly in the salvage of refractory methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bacteremia. Recent clinical data are shaping conundrums of which regimens may be more beneficial, which can be potentially harmful, and which subset of patients stand to benefit from more aggressive treatment regimens than called for by standards. Additionally, the incorporation of combination therapy for MRSA bacteremia should be accompanied by the reminder that antimicrobial therapy does not need to be uniform for the entire duration. An early intensive phase in high inoculum infections (e.g. with combination therapy) should be followed by a consolidation phase (i.e. monotherapy). This review and perspective consolidates the recent data on this subject and directs future goals in filling the knowledge gaps to methodically move forward towards improving patient outcomes.

Regarding the medical management of cellulitis, specifically concerning antibiotic therapy, the IDSA 2014 guidelines recommend administering vancomycin or another antimicrobial agent effective against both MRSA and streptococci. This is advised for patients with cellulitis who also exhibit any of the following conditions:

- **Associated penetrating trauma**: Presence of trauma that penetrates the skin.
- **Evidence of MRSA infection elsewhere**: Confirmed MRSA infection in another body part.
- **Nasal colonization with MRSA**: Presence of MRSA in nasal passages.
- **Injection drug use**: History of using drugs intravenously.
- **Sepsis syndrome**: Signs and symptoms indicative of sepsis.

### Practice patterns of providers for the management of Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia in children: Results of an emerging infections network survey [^115Cka8X]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2018). Low credibility.

Staphylococcus aureus is a leading cause of bacteremia in children; however, optimal management of these patients remains unclear. The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelines for the treatment of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) bacteremia recommend vancomycin therapy for up to 6 weeks, depending on the source and clinical response. Guidelines for the treatment of methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) bacteremia recommend nafcillin as first-line therapy, with cefazolin as an alternative.

Despite these recommendations, applying broad guidelines to specific scenarios encountered in the management of S. aureus bacteremia (SAB) in children remains difficult. Recent literature has challenged long-held notions regarding optimal management of SAB associated with osteoarticular infections; however, there remains a paucity of evidence to guide management in several other common scenarios, including nonpersistent SAB without a source, prolonged MRSA bacteremia, and central-line associated SAB. Given the complexity in the management of children with SAB, we sought to describe practice patterns and clinical decision-making among pediatric infectious diseases (PID) providers.

### Cost-effectiveness of daptomycin versus vancomycin and gentamicin for patients with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia and/or endocarditis [^114K9Acd]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2009). High credibility.

Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is an increasingly common cause of bacteremia and endocarditis. The cost-effectiveness of daptomycin was compared with that of vancomycin-gentamicin in patients with MRSA bacteremia with or without endocarditis.

- **Methods**: With data from an open-label, randomized study comparing daptomycin with vancomycin-gentamicin in the aforementioned patient population, three cost strata were considered:
	1. Study drug acquisition: daptomycin at $0.37/mg, vancomycin at $7/g, and gentamicin at $0.12/mg.
	2. Stratum 1 plus costs for treatment failures, adverse events, therapeutic drug monitoring, and preparation and administration of all medications.
	3. Stratum 2 plus hospital bed costs.

Drug costs were based on the mean wholesale price, with other costs based on those typical for a community hospital. Cost-effectiveness ratios were calculated as cost divided by the proportion of successes. Sensitivity analyses were performed by varying the study drug cost.

- **Results**: Forty-five patients (20 successes) received daptomycin, and 44 patients (14 successes) received vancomycin-gentamicin. The median cost-effectiveness ratios for daptomycin and vancomycin-gentamicin for each cost stratum were as follows:
	- **Stratum 1**: $4082 (range, $1062-$13,893) for daptomycin and $560 (range, $66-$1649) for vancomycin-gentamicin (P < .001).
	- **Stratum 2**: $4582 (range, $1109-$21,882) for daptomycin and $1635 (range, $163-$33,444) for vancomycin-gentamicin (P = 0.026).
	- **Stratum 3**: $23,639 (range, $6225-$141,132) for daptomycin and $26,073 (range, $5349-$187,287) for vancomycin-gentamicin (P = 0.82).

Sensitivity analyses indicated that if the cost…

### Combination therapy with lysin CF-301 and antibiotic is superior to antibiotic alone for treating methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus-induced murine bacteremia [^1131UStx]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Lysins are bacteriophage-derived enzymes that degrade bacterial peptidoglycans. Lysin CF-301 is being developed to treat Staphylococcus aureus because of its potent, specific, and rapid bacteriolytic effects. It also demonstrates activity on drug-resistant strains, has a low resistance profile, eradicates biofilms, and acts synergistically with antibiotics. CF-301 was bacteriolytic against 250 S. aureus strains tested, including 120 methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) isolates. In time-kill studies with 62 strains, CF-301 reduced S. aureus by 3-log10 within 30 minutes compared to 6–12 hours required by antibiotics. In bacteremia, CF-301 increased survival by reducing blood MRSA 100-fold within 1 hour. Combinations of CF-301 with vancomycin or daptomycin synergized in vitro and increased survival significantly in staphylococcal-induced bacteremia compared to treatment with antibiotics alone (P < .0001). The superiority of CF-301 combinations with antibiotics was confirmed in 26 independent bacteremia studies. Combinations including CF-301 and antibiotics represent an attractive alternative to antibiotic monotherapies currently used to treat S. aureus bacteremia.
