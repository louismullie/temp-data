## Question

A 58-year-old man with a history of alcohol-related cirrhosis presents for routine follow-up. He has moderate ascites, which was recently tapped for diagnostic purposes. Laboratory results show ascitic fluid protein of 1.2 g/L, serum creatinine of 1.4 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen of 28 mg/dL, serum sodium of 128 mEq/L, total bilirubin of 3.5 mg/dL, and a Child-Turcotte-Pugh score of 10. He has never had an episode of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP).

Based on current guidelines, should this patient be considered for primary prophylaxis against spontaneous bacterial peritonitis? Justify your answer using the relevant criteria.

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether a 58-year-old man with alcohol-related cirrhosis, moderate ascites, and low ascitic protein should receive primary prophylaxis for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, and how to justify that decision using current guidelines and evidence. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the patient's baseline risk of SBP and whether he meets accepted high-risk criteria. Then, I should verify the specific guideline thresholds for ascitic protein, renal dysfunction, liver failure, and Child-Pugh score. Next, I will weigh the strength and limitations of the evidence supporting primary prophylaxis, including resistance concerns and conflicting data. Finally, I will synthesize a recommendation and outline practical prescribing and monitoring details with shared decision-making in mind.

> Let me first confirm the risk stratification. Low ascitic protein is a major risk factor; an ascitic total protein less than 1.5 g/dL places patients at higher risk of SBP, and in this case the protein is 1.2 g/dL, so he meets that criterion. I should also confirm the additional high-risk features: renal dysfunction with creatinine 1.4 mg/dL exceeds the 1.2 mg/dL threshold, BUN 28 mg/dL exceeds the 25 mg/dL threshold, sodium 128 mEq/L is below the 130 mEq/L threshold, and the Child-Pur score of 10 with bilirubin 3.5 mg/dL meets the "advanced liver failure" definition used in guidelines, so he has multiple high-risk features beyond low protein alone [^11277hDs] [^112qsq2X] [^112AvfC2].

> Wait, let me verify the exact guideline language so I don't overstate this. The AASLD 2021 guidance recommends considering primary prophylaxis in selected patients with cirrhosis, low ascitic protein, and either renal dysfunction or liver failure, precisely the profile this patient exhibits. BASL/BSG 2021 similarly recommends primary prophylaxis for high-risk patients defined by ascitic protein less than 1.5 g/dL, with discussion of uncertainties. EASL 2018 aligns with norfloxacin for Child-Pugh score at least 9 with bilirubin at least 3 mg/dL plus low protein or renal dysfunction, which again fits this case [^11277hDs] [^112qsq2X] [^1122X7i3] [^114NAHx8] [^114NAHx8].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I need to check the strength of evidence and resistance concerns. The pivotal randomized trial showed norfloxacin dramatically reduced 1-year SBP incidence from 61% to 7% and improved 3-month and 1-year survival in exactly this high-risk phenotype, which is compelling. However, more recent data, including the NORFLOCIR trial, did not show a mortality benefit despite reducing SBP, and there are legitimate concerns about quinolone resistance and adverse effects with prolonged fluoroquinolone exposure. A 2020 Cochrane network meta-analysis concluded the certainty of benefit is low to very low, underscoring the need to individualize decisions and monitor closely if prophylaxis is used [^113FbXwy] [^1114RNB2] [^114NAHx8] [^113ddbNg].

> I should double-check alternatives because norfloxacin availability can be limited. Rifaximin has been studied, but high-quality evidence for primary prophylaxis is limited and mixed. A recent randomized trial of rifaximin for primary prophylaxis did not improve 12-month survival or reduce liver complications, though adherence-modified analyses suggested fewer liver-related events, so rifaximin cannot be recommended routinely for primary prophylaxis outside trials at this time. Thus, if prophylaxis is chosen, norfloxacin remains first-line per guidelines, with ciprofloxacin as an alternative where norfloxacin is unavailable [^115Vp2DD] [^112qsq2X] [^116wtfuc].

> Let me consider the balance of benefits and risks for this specific patient. His 1-year SBP risk is estimated at 20–60% given low protein plus advanced liver disease and renal dysfunction, which is substantial. Norfloxacin reduced SBP and improved short-term survival in the landmark trial, but long-term mortality benefit is uncertain and resistance may blunt efficacy over time. Given his decompensated cirrhosis and high short-term risk, a cautious, time-limited trial of prophylaxis with close monitoring is reasonable, with a plan to reassess ongoing need and stop if ascites resolves or if resistance emerges [^11277hDs] [^113FbXwy] [^114NAHx8].

> I will now examine practical implementation and safety. If proceeding, norfloxacin 400 mg orally once daily is the guideline-preferred regimen. Ciprofloxacin 500 mg daily is an accepted alternative where norfloxacin is not available. I should confirm there is no active infection, avoid use if there is recent or ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding where IV ceftriaxone is indicated instead, and counsel on adverse effects and the need to report tendon pain or neuropsychiatric symptoms given fluoroquinolone safety concerns. I need to ensure we minimize concurrent PPI exposure when possible because PPI use is associated with increased SBP risk, and I should plan periodic reassessment of renal function, sodium, and ascites status to decide whether to continue prophylaxis [^112qsq2X] [^114nncfC] [^113M6dki] [^113txWTL] [^115feZNS].

> But wait, what if we prioritize non-antibiotic strategies that reduce infection risk and complications. I should confirm that he is on optimal ascites management with sodium restriction and diuretics, consider albumin with large-volume paracentesis, and evaluate for liver transplantation given Child-Pugh C features, because addressing the underlying disease trajectory may mitigate SBP risk more definitively than chronic antibiotics. This does not negate short-term prophylaxis, but it frames the decision as part of comprehensive decompensated cirrhosis care rather than isolated antibiotic use [^114sSMDj] [^111Yb1bd].

> Final recommendation: Yes, this patient should be offered primary SBP prophylaxis because he has low ascitic protein and multiple additional high-risk features including advanced liver failure and renal dysfunction, aligning with AASLD and BASL/BSG guidance. I should use shared decision-making to discuss uncertain long-term mortality benefit, resistance risks, and the plan for ongoing reassessment, and if chosen, prescribe norfloxacin 400 mg daily with safety counseling and close follow-up, while optimizing overall cirrhosis care and transplant evaluation [^11277hDs] [^112qsq2X] [^1122X7i3] [^115i59Ji].

---

This patient should receive **primary SBP prophylaxis** because he has **ascitic protein < 1.5 g/dL** [^11277hDs] and advanced liver disease (Child-Pugh 10) with renal dysfunction (Cr 1.4 mg/dL) [^112AvfC2], which places him at high risk for a first SBP episode [^11277hDs]. Current AASLD guidance recommends **norfloxacin 400 mg daily** [^11277hDs] for primary prophylaxis in this setting, with ciprofloxacin 500 mg daily as an alternative if norfloxacin is unavailable [^112qsq2X]. Prophylaxis should be continued until ascites resolves or liver function improves, with ongoing monitoring for adverse effects and antibiotic resistance [^113M6dki].

## Risk factors for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis

Several risk factors increase the likelihood of developing SBP in patients with cirrhosis and ascites:

- **Low ascitic protein concentration**: Ascitic protein < 1.5 g/dL is a major risk factor for SBP [^11277hDs] [^111P1Zjh].
- **Advanced liver disease**: Child-Pugh score ≥ 9 and serum bilirubin > 3 mg/dL indicate severe liver dysfunction and increased SBP risk [^11277hDs] [^113FbXwy].
- **Renal dysfunction**: Serum creatinine > 1.2 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen > 25 mg/dL, or serum sodium < 130 mEq/L are associated with higher SBP risk [^11277hDs] [^113FbXwy].
- **Previous episode of SBP**: Patients with a prior SBP episode have a high recurrence risk and require secondary prophylaxis [^116wtfuc] [^112Vj7Py].

---

## Evidence supporting primary prophylaxis

Multiple studies and meta-analyses have demonstrated the efficacy of antibiotic prophylaxis in reducing the incidence of SBP in high-risk patients:

- **Norfloxacin trial**: In patients with low ascitic protein and advanced liver disease or renal dysfunction, norfloxacin reduced the 1-year probability of SBP from 60% to 7% and improved survival [^113FbXwy] [^11277hDs].
- **Meta-analysis**: Fluoroquinolone prophylaxis significantly reduced the risk of first SBP, serious infections, and mortality in high-risk cirrhotic patients [^111P1Zjh].
- **AASLD guidance**: Recommends primary prophylaxis for patients with low ascitic protein and advanced liver disease or renal dysfunction [^11277hDs] [^112AvfC2].

---

## Current guideline recommendations

The **AASLD 2021 guidance** recommends primary SBP prophylaxis for patients with cirrhosis, low ascitic protein (< 1.5 g/dL), and either advanced liver disease (Child-Pugh ≥ 9 and bilirubin > 3 mg/dL) or renal dysfunction (serum creatinine > 1.2 mg/dL, BUN > 25 mg/dL, or serum sodium < 130 mEq/L) [^11277hDs] [^112AvfC2]. The **BASL/BSG 2021 guidance** similarly recommends primary prophylaxis for patients with ascitic protein < 1.5 g/dL, emphasizing individualized risk–benefit discussion [^1122X7i3] [^115i59Ji].

---

## Applicability to the patient

The patient meets **multiple high-risk criteria**:

| **Risk factor** | **Patient's status** |
|-|-|
| Ascitic protein | 1.2 g/dL (< 1.5 g/dL) |
| Child-Pugh score | 10 (≥ 9) |
| Serum bilirubin | 3.5 mg/dL (> 3 mg/dL) |
| Serum creatinine | 1.4 mg/dL (> 1.2 mg/dL) |
| Blood urea nitrogen | 28 mg/dL (> 25 mg/dL) |
| Serum sodium | 128 mEq/L (< 130 mEq/L) |

---

Given these findings, the patient clearly meets the criteria for **primary SBP prophylaxis** as outlined by current guidelines [^11277hDs] [^1122X7i3].

---

## Recommended antibiotic regimen

The **preferred antibiotic** is norfloxacin 400 mg orally once daily [^11277hDs]; if norfloxacin is unavailable, ciprofloxacin 500 mg orally once daily is an acceptable alternative [^112qsq2X]. Prophylaxis should continue until ascites resolves or liver function improves significantly, with regular monitoring for adverse effects and antibiotic resistance [^113M6dki].

---

## Potential risks and benefits

Benefits include a **significant reduction in SBP incidence**, improved survival, and delayed progression to hepatorenal syndrome [^113FbXwy] [^111P1Zjh]. Risks include **antibiotic resistance**, Clostridioides difficile infection, and adverse drug reactions; these risks necessitate careful patient selection and monitoring [^113M6dki] [^113ddbNg].

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

The patient should receive **primary SBP prophylaxis** with norfloxacin 400 mg daily [^11277hDs] or ciprofloxacin 500 mg daily if norfloxacin is unavailable [^112qsq2X]. This recommendation is supported by strong evidence and current guidelines, given his low ascitic protein, advanced liver disease, and renal dysfunction [^11277hDs] [^1122X7i3]. Prophylaxis should be continued until ascites resolves or liver function improves, with ongoing monitoring for adverse effects and antibiotic resistance [^113M6dki].

### Ciprofloxacin in primary prophylaxis of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis: a randomized, placebo-controlled study [^112R1Xap]. Journal of Hepatology (2008). Low credibility.

Background/Aims

Low protein concentration in ascitic fluid has been identified as a risk factor for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). Until now, primary prophylaxis has not been recommended in these patients. The aim was to investigate the efficacy of long-term administration of ciprofloxacin to prevent SBP.

Methods

One hundred cirrhotic patients with < 1.5 g/dl of total protein in ascitic fluid were randomized prospectively, in a double blind fashion to receive ciprofloxacin 500 mg/day (n = 50) or placebo (n = 50) for 12 months.

Results

Baseline data were similar in both groups. In the ciprofloxacin group, SBP occurred almost four times less frequently than in the placebo group but it was not statistically significant. The probability of survival at 12 months was significantly higher in patients receiving ciprofloxacin (86% versus 66%) (p < 0.04). SBP and sepsis were the most frequent causes of death in the placebo group whereas gastrointestinal bleeding was responsible for the most deaths in the ciprofloxacin group. The probability of remaining free of bacterial infections was higher in patients receiving ciprofloxacin (80% versus 55%) (p = 0.05).

Conclusions

Patients with cirrhosis and low protein concentration in ascitic fluid are candidates to receive long-term prophylaxis to reduce the risk of infections and improve survival.

### Long-term prophylaxis of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in patients with cirrhosis [^117Y663m]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the literature regarding long-term prophylaxis of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) in patients with cirrhosis.

Data Sources

A MEDLINE (1967-September 2004) and bibliographic search of the English-language literature was conducted using the search terms spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, cirrhosis, antimicrobial, and prophylaxis.

Data Synthesis

Long-term antimicrobial prophylaxis has been shown to decrease recurrent SBP in cirrhotics with a prior episode. Prophylaxis in patients with low ascitic fluid protein has also been shown to reduce the incidence of SBP; however, studies are too in-homogeneous to identify subgroups that benefit the most.

Conclusions

Long-term antimicrobial therapy should be considered for secondary prophylaxis of SBP. Studies should be done to confirm this benefit and identify subsets of patients with low ascitic fluid protein who clearly benefit.

### Norfloxacin primary prophylaxis of bacterial infections in cirrhotic patients with ascites: a double-blind randomized trial [^112XiWx2]. Journal of Hepatology (1998). Low credibility.

The study Norfloxacin for primary SBP prophylaxis was published by Grange JD and colleagues in 1998 in the journal J Hepatol. This study is related to the following diseases: Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. In the Norfloxacin for primary SBP prophylaxis study, the trial question was: what is the role of norfloxacin in patients with cirrhosis and low ascitic fluid protein levels (< 15 g/L)? In the Norfloxacin for primary SBP prophylaxis study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the Norfloxacin for primary SBP prophylaxis study, the population was: 107 patients (39 female, 68 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with cirrhosis and low ascitic fluid protein levels (< 15 g/L) who had no history of infection and no active infection since cirrhosis diagnosis. The key exclusion criteria were active gastrointestinal bleeding on admission, HCC or other life-threatening disease or failure to provide written informed consent. In the Norfloxacin for primary SBP prophylaxis study, the interventions were: n = 53 norfloxacin (400 mg/day for 6 months) n = 54 placebo (matching placebo daily for 6 months). In the Norfloxacin for primary SBP prophylaxis study, the primary outcome was: significant decrease in gram-negative infection (0% vs. 11%; ARD -11, 95% CI -20.12 to -1.88). In the Norfloxacin for primary SBP prophylaxis study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in severe infection (2% vs. 17%;). In the Norfloxacin for primary SBP prophylaxis study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in mortality. In the Norfloxacin for primary SBP prophylaxis study, the conclusion was: in patients with cirrhosis and low ascitic fluid protein levels (< 15 g/L) who had no history of infection and no active infection since cirrhosis diagnosis, norfloxacin was superior to placebo with respect to a gram-negative infection.

### Role of fluoroquinolones in the primary prophylaxis of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis: meta-analysis [^111P1Zjh]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2009). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

The use of antibiotics in the primary prophylaxis for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) in patients with cirrhosis is controversial. Our purpose was to determine the beneficial effect of fluoroquinolones as compared with placebo in primary prophylaxis of SBP in high-risk patients with cirrhosis by using meta-analysis.

Methods

Medline, Embase, Cochrane, and Web of Science databases were searched in all languages until August 2008 for randomized placebo-controlled studies evaluating the role of fluoroquinolones in primary prevention of SBP in patients with low protein ascites (total ascitic protein, < 1.5 g/dL) and without history of SBP. Two investigators independently performed literature search and data extraction, and then another investigator independently reviewed whether the studies met prespecified criteria and rechecked data extraction. Odds ratios (Peto method) for the risk reduction with fluoroquinolones were calculated for each study and combined by using a random-effects model.

Results

Four randomized controlled studies met predefined criteria. The odds ratios for developing first episode of SBP, serious infections, and mortality with fluoroquinolone prophylaxis (n = 194) versus placebo (n = 190) were 0.18 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.09–0.35), 0.18 (95% CI, 0.10–0.32), and 0.60 (95% CI, 0.37–0.97), respectively. All studies were unidirectional in showing the beneficial effect of fluoroquinolone prophylaxis. We were limited by finding few studies with relatively small sample sizes.

Conclusions

Daily oral fluoroquinolone prophylaxis reduces the risk of development of first episode of SBP and mortality in cirrhotic patients with low total protein in the ascitic fluid. Fluoroquinolones might be advisable for the primary prophylaxis of SBP in selected high-risk patients with cirrhosis.

PRISMA flow diagram.

Criteria for considering studies for this review

Types of interventions

We included trials that studied long-term (> 3 months) administration of rifaximin at any dose compared with norfloxacin for the purpose of primary or secondary prevention of SBP.

Types of participants

Studies that recruited patients with cirrhosis (irrespective of aetiology) and ascites were included in our analysis.

The indications for long term SBP prophylaxis included either primary (high risk patients with baseline ascitic fluid total protein < 1.5 g/dL along with impaired renal function [serum creatinine ≥ 1.2 mg/dL, BUN ≥ 25 mg/dL or serum Na ≤ 130 mEq/L] or patients with liver failure [Child-Pugh score ≥ 9 and serum bilirubin ≥ 3 mg/dL]) or secondary prophylaxis (previous episode of SBP).

Patients with active or recent gastrointestinal bleed, known liver malignancy or hypersensitivity to the planned drugs were excluded.

Types of outcome measures

The primary outcome measure across all studies was the occurrence of SBP. We used the AASLD definition of SBP, that is, the diagnosis is made in the presence of an elevated ascitic fluid absolute polymorphonuclear leucocyte (PMNL) count ≥ 250 cells/mm³ without an evident intra-abdominal, surgically treatable source of infection. The secondary outcome measure was all-cause mortality, defined as death due to any cause during the study period.

Study search and selection

We performed both computerised and manual searching of articles from digital dissertation databases, including Google Scholar, CINAHL, MEDLINE and Cochrane CENTRAL Register for Controlled Trials from 1950 until January 2017. We limited our search to studies involving humans only and articles published in the English language using keywords and/or medical subject headings (MeSH) for 'rifaximin' and 'norfloxacin' and 'spontaneous bacterial peritonitis'.

Reference lists of returned search articles were manually screened. Two authors independently reviewed all articles for inclusion. First, all titles and abstracts were assessed and irrelevant articles were rejected. Second, full-text articles were assessed and studies were selected based on meeting the inclusion criteria. After identifying relevant titles, all abstracts were read and eligible articles were selected.

### Diagnosis, evaluation, and management of ascites, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and hepatorenal syndrome: 2021 practice guidance by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^11277hDs]. Hepatology (2021). High credibility.

Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) primary prophylaxis — In patients without a prior history of SBP, antibiotics should be used judiciously and sparingly and reserved only for those at the highest risk of infection. In cirrhosis with acute upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage, a meta-analysis found that short-term (5–7 days) selective intestinal decontamination (mostly oral norfloxacin) reduced the rate of infections, including SBP, and improved survival, and because the emergence of quinolone-resistant organisms has decreased the prophylactic efficacy of norfloxacin, IV ceftriaxone is currently the recommended antibiotic in patients with hemorrhage; alternative drugs are discouraged and SBP and other infections should be ruled out before starting the antibiotic. In patients without gastrointestinal hemorrhage and without a prior episode of SBP, antibiotic prophylaxis may be considered in selected high-risk patients, for example those with low (< 1.5 g/dL) ascitic fluid protein; even with low ascites protein, the 1-year probability of SBP may vary between 20% and 60%. In a landmark trial, norfloxacin was associated with a significantly reduced 1-year probability of first SBP compared with placebo (60% vs. 7%) in patients with low protein ascites and advanced liver disease (Child-Turcotte-Pugh score > 9 points with serum bilirubin level > 3 mg/dL) or with impaired renal function defined by serum creatinine level > 1.2 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen level > 25 mg/dL, or serum sodium level < 130 mEq/L.

### Diagnosis, evaluation, and management of ascites, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and hepatorenal syndrome: 2021 practice guidance by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^112qsq2X]. Hepatology (2021). High credibility.

Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) prophylaxis — AASLD 2021 guidance states that evidence for primary prophylaxis with antibiotics is not strong and is restricted to patients with very advanced cirrhosis, and SBP prophylaxis should be individualized based on estimated risks and benefits. SBP should receive long-term prophylaxis with daily norfloxacin; in settings in which norfloxacin is unavailable, oral ciprofloxacin is acceptable. In patients with cirrhosis and upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage, antibiotic prophylaxis for SBP should be instituted; IV ceftriaxone 1 g/24 hours is the antibiotic of choice and should be used for a maximum of 7 days. In patients with cirrhosis and low protein (< 1.5 g/dL) ascites, primary SBP prophylaxis can be considered in selected patients with renal dysfunction (serum creatinine level > 1.2 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen level > 25 mg/dL, or serum sodium level < 130 mEq/L) or liver failure (Child-Turcotte-Pugh score > 9 and bilirubin > 3 mg/dL).

### Primary prophylaxis of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis delays hepatorenal syndrome and improves survival in cirrhosis [^113FbXwy]. Gastroenterology (2007). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

Norfloxacin is highly effective in preventing spontaneous bacterial peritonitis recurrence in cirrhosis, but its role in the primary prevention of this complication is uncertain.

Methods

Patients with cirrhosis and low protein ascitic levels (< 15 g/L) with advanced liver failure (Child-Pugh score ≥ 9 points with serum bilirubin level ≥ 3 mg/dL) or impaired renal function (serum creatinine level ≥ 1.2 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen level ≥ 25 mg/dL, or serum sodium level ≤ 130 mEq/L) were included in a randomized controlled trial aimed at comparing norfloxacin (35 patients) vs placebo (33 patients) in the primary prophylaxis of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. The main end points of the trial were 3-month and 1-year probability of survival. Secondary end points were 1-year probability of development of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and hepatorenal syndrome.

Results

Norfloxacin administration reduced the 1-year probability of developing spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (7% vs 61%, P < .001) and hepatorenal syndrome (28% vs 41%, P = 0.02), and improved the 3-month (94% vs 62%, P = 0.003) and the 1-year (60% vs 48%, P = 0.05) probability of survival compared with placebo.

Conclusions

Primary prophylaxis with norfloxacin has a great impact in the clinical course of patients with advanced cirrhosis. It reduces the incidence of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, delays the development of hepatorenal syndrome, and improves survival.

Regarding preventative measures for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, more specifically with respect to primary prevention, advanced liver disease, BASL/BSG 2021 guidelines recommend to administer primary prophylaxis for SBP in high-risk patients, as defined by an ascitic protein count < 1.5 g/dL, with a discussion of potential risks and benefits and existing uncertainties with patients.

### Diagnosis, evaluation, and management of ascites, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and hepatorenal syndrome: 2021 practice guidance by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^115DA4bU]. Hepatology (2021). High credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, more specifically with respect to primary prevention, advanced liver disease, AASLD 2021 guidelines recommend to consider administering primary prophylaxis for SBP in selected patients with cirrhosis and low protein (< 1.5 g/L) ascites and renal dysfunction (serum creatinine level > 1.2 mg/dL, BUN level > 25 mg/dL or serum sodium level < 130 mEq/L) or liver failure (Child-Turcotte-Pugh score > 9 and bilirubin > 3 mg/dL).

### Antibiotic prophylaxis for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis: benefit or risk? [^114x6Nhh]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) is associated with risk of acute on chronic liver failure (ACLF). Current guidelines recommend primary and secondary antibiotic prophylaxis for patients with cirrhosis and ascites who are at risk of a first episode and to prevent recurrence, respectively. Factors associated with prophylaxis failure leading to SBP, ACLF, and increased mortality are not well established. Gram-positive and multidrug-resistant organisms have become more frequently associated with SBP, particularly in the setting of ACLF. Efforts to understand how long-term antibiotic therapy may affect individual risk of SBP in this population will be critical to developing optimal preventive strategies.

### Effect of rifaximin in patients with severe cirrhosis and ascites: a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial [^115Vp2DD]. Journal of Hepatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background&Aims

Evidence for primary prophylaxis of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) is weak and the selection of quinolone-resistant bacteria is currently of concern. Here we present results from a randomized, double-blind, placebo (PBO)-controlled trial to assess whether rifaximin (RFX) has a beneficial effect on 12-month survival in patients with severe cirrhosis and ascites.

Methods

In this trial conducted at 17 French centers, patients with severe cirrhosis and grade 2 or 3 ascites and ascites protein level < 15 g/L were randomized 1:1 to receive RFX 550 mg or PBO BID for 12 months, as primary prophylaxis for SBP. The primary endpoint was 12-month survival. Secondary endpoints were 3- and 6-month survival, incidence of complications of cirrhosis, and safety of RFX.

Results

Between 2018 and 2022, 1957 cirrhotic patients with ascites were screened, 159 were randomized, and 152 (80/72 PBO/RFX) were analyzed in the modified intention-to-treat population. RFX did not improve 12-month (PBO/RFX: 68.1% [95% CI 56.2–78.7] / 56.6% [95% CI 43.5–67.8], p = 0.74), 6-month (71.1% [95% CI 59.5–80.0] / 76.4% [95% CI 64.3–84.8]) or 3-month survivals (75.4% [95% CI 64.1–83.5]/82.6% [95% CI 71.4–89.7]), or the incidence of liver complications (SBP, encephalopathy, gastrointestinal bleeding or hepatorenal syndrome). In the per-protocol population (127 patients adherent to the study drug), a lower 12-month cumulative incidence of liver-related events in the RFX group was observed. RFX was well tolerated throughout the study.

Conclusions

RFX had no beneficial effect in terms of 12-month survival or incidence of complications of liver cirrhosis in patients with severe cirrhosis and low ascitic fluid protein levels. Improving patient adherence could reduce liver complications of cirrhosis.

Impact and Implications

Selective gut decontamination using norfloxacin is the standard of care for secondary prophylaxis of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). Evidence for primary prophylaxis of SBP is weaker, and fluoroquinolones have been associated with an increased risk of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Rifaximin, a well-tolerated broad-spectrum antibiotic with a lower risk of AMR emergence, may be an alternative to norfloxacin. Our trial did not demonstrate an improvement in survival or liver complications (SBP, gastrointestinal bleeding, hepatic encephalopathy or hepatorenal syndrome) at 12 months with rifaximin as primary prophylaxis for SBP versus placebo. However, in the subgroup of patients who adhered to rifaximin, liver complications decreased. Our study highlights the importance of study drug adherence in clinical trials to adequately assess outcomes.

### Antibiotic prophylaxis for prevention of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in patients without gastrointestinal bleeding [^116tr1M4]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To review relevant studies for both primary and secondary antibiotic prophylaxis of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) in patients with cirrhosis without gastrointestinal bleeding.

Data Sources

A search of PubMed (1980-July 2010) was conducted using the terms prophylaxis, SBP, and antibiotics. A manual review of bibliographies was conducted for inclusion of relevant articles.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Prospective studies and meta-analyses published in English were included.

Data Synthesis

Ten trials and 3 meta-analyses were included. Of the 10 trials, 2 examined the use of secondary prophylaxis for prevention of subsequent episodes of SBP, 4 examined the use of primary prophylaxis to prevent an initial SBP episode, and 4 examined the use of antibiotic prophylaxis in a mixed population. Seven trials evaluated the use of an antibiotic compared to placebo or no treatment. Only 1 trial evaluated norfloxacin versus trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. Trial duration varied from 24 days to 12 months. In general, trials examining norfloxacin as secondary prophylaxis found significantly decreased occurrence of SBP but no significant difference in mortality rates. Primary prophylaxis studies found no significant difference in the incidence of infections, including SBP, with norfloxacin or ciprofloxacin treatment but significantly lower incidence of gram-negative infections. Mixed population studies found a significantly decreased incidence of SBP but no significant difference in mortality. In the 3 meta-analyses, a significant decrease in mortality and an overall decrease in SBP incidence in the treatment groups were noted.

Conclusions

Based on currently available data, the use of prophylactic antibiotic therapy is warranted for the prevention of recurrent SBP in patients with cirrhosis and ascites. In patients with low ascetic fluid protein and at least 1 more risk factor, primary prophylaxis may be considered. Further studies with improved methodology are needed to determine whether prophylactic antibiotic therapy has an impact on mortality.

Recommendations

Diagnostic paracentesis should be carried out without a delay to rule out SBP in all cirrhotic patients with ascites on hospital admission. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong)
A diagnostic paracentesis should be performed in patients with GI bleeding, shock, fever or other signs of systemic inflammation, gastrointestinal symptoms, hepatic encephalopathy, and in patients with worsening liver or renal function. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong)
Ascitic neutrophil > 250/mm³ count remains the gold standard for the diagnosis of SBP and this can be performed either by manual microscopy or using automated counts, based on flow cytometry for counting and differentiating cells. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong)
Ascitic fluid culture with bedside inoculation of blood culture bottles should be performed to guide the choice of antibiotic treatment when SBP is suspected. (Quality of evidence: moderate, Recommendation: strong)
Immediate empirical antibiotic therapy should be determined with due consideration of context of SBP (community acquired or healthcare associated), severity of infection and local bacterial resistance profile. Cefotaxime has been widely studied, but choice of antibiotic should be guided by local resistance patterns and protocol. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong)
A second diagnostic paracentesis at 48 hours from the start of treatment to check the efficacy of antibiotic therapy should be considered in those who have apparently inadequate response or where secondary bacterial peritonitis is suspected. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak)
Patients presenting with gastrointestinal bleeding and underlying ascites due to cirrhosis should receive prophylactic antibiotic treatment (cefotaxime has been widely studied but the antibiotic should be chosen based on local data) to prevent the development of SBP. (Quality of evidence: strong, Recommendation: strong)
Patients who have recovered from an episode of SBP should be considered for treatment with norfloxacin (400 mg once daily), ciprofloxacin (500 mg once daily, orally) or co-trimoxazole (800 mg sulfamethoxazole and 160 mg trimethoprim daily, orally) to prevent further episode of SBP. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak)
Primary prophylaxis should be offered to patients considered at high risk, as defined by an ascitic protein count < 1.5 g/dL. However, it is important that the potential risks and benefits and existing uncertainties are communicated to patients. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak)

(Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak) 2.7. Patients presenting with gastrointestinal bleeding and underlying ascites due to cirrhosis should receive prophylactic antibiotic treatment (cefotaxime has been widely studied but the antibiotic should be chosen based on local data) to prevent the development of SBP. (Quality of evidence: strong; Recommendation: strong) 2.8. Patients who have recovered from an episode of SBP should be considered for treatment with norfloxacin (400 mg once daily), ciprofloxacin (500 mg once daily, orally) or co-trimoxazole (800 mg sulfamethoxazole and 160 mg trimethoprim daily, orally) to prevent further episode of SBP. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak) 2.9. Primary prophylaxis should be offered to patients considered at high risk, as defined by an ascitic protein count < 1.5 g/dL. However, it is important that the potential risks and benefits and existing uncertainties are communicated to patients. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak)
Dietary salt restriction 3.1. Patients with cirrhosis and ascites should have a moderately salt restricted diet with daily salt intake of no more than 5–6.5 g (87–113 mmol sodium). This translates to a no added salt diet with avoidance of precooked meals. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong) 3.2. Patients with cirrhosis and ascites should receive nutritional counselling on the sodium content in the diet. (Quality of evidence: weak; Recommendation: strong)
Diuretics 4.1. In patients with the first presentation of moderate ascites, spironolactone monotherapy (starting dose 100 mg, increased to 400 mg) is reasonable. In those with recurrent severe ascites, and if faster diuresis is needed (for example, if the patient is hospitalised), combination therapy with spironolactone (starting dose 100 mg, increased to 400 mg) and furosemide (starting dose 40 mg, increased to 160 mg) is recommended. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong) 4.2. All patients initiating diuretics should be monitored for adverse events. Almost half of those with adverse events require diuretic discontinuation or dose reduction. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak) 4.3. Hypovolaemic hyponatraemia during diuretic therapy should be managed by discontinuation of diuretics and expansion of plasma volume with normal saline. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak) 4.4. Fluid restriction to 1–1.5 L/day should be reserved for those who are clinically hypervolaemic with severe hyponatraemia (serum sodium < 125 mmol/L). (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak) 4.5. Hypertonic sodium chloride (3%) administration should be reserved for those who are severely symptomatic with acute hyponatraemia. Serum sodium should be slowly corrected. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak) 4.6. It may be appropriate to consider use of midodrine in refractory ascites on a case by case basis. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak)
Large volume paracentesis (LVP) 5.1. Patients should give informed consent for a therapeutic or diagnostic paracentesis. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: strong) 5.2. Ultrasound guidance should be considered when available during LVP to reduce the risk of adverse events (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak) 5.3. Routine measurement of the prothrombin time and platelet count before therapeutic or diagnostic paracentesis and infusion of blood products are not recommended. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong)
Use of human albumin solution (HAS) 6.1. Albumin (as 20% or 25% solution) should be infused after paracentesis of > 5 L is completed at a dose of 8 g albumin/L of ascites removed. (Quality of evidence: high; Recommendation: strong) 6.2. Albumin (as 20% or 25% solution) can be considered after paracentesis of < 5 L at a dose of 8 g albumin/L of ascites removed in patients with ACLF or high risk of post-paracentesis acute kidney injury. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak) 6.3. In patients with SBP and an increased serum creatinine or a rising serum creatinine, infusion of 1.5 g albumin/kg within 6 hours of diagnosis, followed by 1 g/kg on day 3, is recommended. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak)
Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPSS) 7.1. TIPSS should be considered in patients with refractory ascites. (Quality of evidence: high; Recommendation: strong) 7.2. Caution is required if considering TIPSS in patients with age > 70 years, serum bilirubin > 50 µmol/L, platelet count < 75×10⁹/L, model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score ≥ 18, current hepatic encephalopathy, active infection or hepatorenal syndrome. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong)
Umbilical hernia 8.1. Suitability and timing of surgical repair of umbilical hernia should be considered in discussion with the patient and multidisciplinary team involving physicians, surgeons and anaesthetists. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: strong)
Hepatic hydrothorax (HH) 9.1. TIPSS should be considered in patients with HH after discussion with the multidisciplinary team. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: strong) 9.2. In patients with HH who are not undergoing a TIPSS and/or a liver transplant evaluation, alternative palliative interventions should be considered. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: strong)
Non-selective beta-blockers (NSBB) and ascites 10.1. Refractory ascites should not be viewed as a contraindication to NSBB. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong) 10.2. Patients with refractory ascites who are taking NSBB should be monitored closely, and dose reduction or discontinuation may be appropriate in those who develop hypotension or acute/progressive renal dysfunction. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong)
Automated low-flow ascites pump 11.1. An automated low-flow ascites pump should be considered only in special circumstances with robust arrangements of clinical governance, audit or research. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak)
Palliative care 12.1. Patients with refractory ascites who are not undergoing evaluation for liver transplant should be offered a palliative care referral. Besides repeated LVP, alternative palliative interventions for refractory ascites should also be considered. (Quality of evidence: weak; Recommendation: strong)
Research recommendations 13.1. Randomised controlled trials (RCT) with large sample size should evaluate the role of antibiotics in the secondary prophylaxis for SBP in ascites secondary to cirrhosis. 13.2. Large RCTs should assess the role of midodrine in the management of ascites. 13.3. Cost-effectiveness of long-term administration of albumin to patients with decompensated cirrhosis and ascites should be evaluated. 13.4. Role of nutritional interventions in the management of ascites should be evaluated. 13.5. Large RCT of long-term carvedilol versus no carvedilol in patients with refractory ascites without large oesophageal varices should be carried out. 13.6. Role of TIPSS in the management of hepatic hydrothorax should be compared with other therapeutic interventions. 13.7. The cost-effectiveness and the effect of automated low-flow ascites pumps on the quality of life of patients with refractory ascites should be evaluated. 13.8. Effectiveness and safety of long-term abdominal drains should be assessed in RCTs for the palliative care of patients with cirrhosis and refractory ascites.

### The role of rifaximin in the primary prophylaxis of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in patients with liver cirrhosis [^111joXBE]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Primary prophylaxis of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) may provide a survival advantage in cirrhotic patients with ascites and has become an integral part of clinical practice. Rifaximin is a poorly absorbable antibiotic with a broad spectrum of antibacterial action and has low risk of introducing bacterial resistance.

Aim

To determine whether rifaximin is associated with decreasing the risk of SBP and improving transplant-free survival in cirrhotic patients with ascites.

Methods

The medical records of all adult patients with liver cirrhosis and large ascites justifying paracentesis evaluated in our clinic (2003 to 2007) were reviewed. Patients were stratified into 2 groups by the use of rifaximin. Patients were excluded if they had received another antibiotic for SBP prophylaxis or had a history of SBP before rifaximin therapy.

Results

A total of 404 patients were included, of whom 49 (12%) received rifaximin. The rifaximin and nonrifaximin groups were comparable with regards to age, sex, and race. The median follow-up time was 4.2 [1.0, 17.1] months. During this time period, 89% of patients on rifaximin remained SBP free compared with 68% of those not on rifaximin (P = 0.002). After adjusting for Model of End-Stage Liver Disease score, Child-Pugh score, serum sodium, and ascitic fluid total protein, there was a 72% reduction in the rate of SBP in the rifaximin group (hazard ratio = 0.28; 95% confidence interval, 0.11–0.71; P = 0.007). The group treated with rifaximin also demonstrated a transplant-free survival benefit compared with those not on rifaximin (72% vs. 57%, P = 0.045).

Conclusions

Intestinal decontamination with rifaximin may prevent SBP in cirrhotic patients with ascites. Prospective randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm this finding.

### Antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in people with liver cirrhosis: a network meta-analysis [^113ddbNg]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Approximately 2.5% of all hospitalisations in people with liver cirrhosis are for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis is associated with significant short-term mortality; therefore, it is important to prevent spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in people at high risk of developing it. Antibiotic prophylaxis forms the mainstay preventive method, but this has to be balanced against the development of drug-resistant spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, which is difficult to treat, and other adverse events. Several different prophylactic antibiotic treatments are available; however, there is uncertainty surrounding their relative efficacy and optimal combination.

Objectives

To compare the benefits and harms of different prophylactic antibiotic treatments for prevention of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in people with liver cirrhosis using a network meta-analysis and to generate rankings of the different prophylactic antibiotic treatments according to their safety and efficacy.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Science Citation Index Expanded, World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and trials registers to November 2018 to identify randomised clinical trials in people with cirrhosis at risk of developing spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.

Selection Criteria

We included only randomised clinical trials (irrespective of language, blinding, or status) in adults with cirrhosis undergoing prophylactic treatment to prevent spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. We excluded randomised clinical trials in which participants had previously undergone liver transplantation, or were receiving antibiotics for treatment of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis or other purposes.

Data Collection and Analysis

We performed a network meta-analysis with OpenBUGS using Bayesian methods and calculated the odds ratio, rate ratio, and hazard ratio (HR) with 95% credible intervals (CrI) based on an available-case analysis, according to National Institute of Health and Care Excellence Decision Support Unit guidance.

Main Results

We included 29 randomised clinical trials (3896 participants; nine antibiotic regimens (ciprofloxacin, neomycin, norfloxacin, norfloxacin plus neomycin, norfloxacin plus rifaximin, rifaximin, rufloxacin, sparfloxacin, sulfamethoxazole plus trimethoprim), and 'no active intervention' in the review. Twenty-three trials (2587 participants) were included in one or more outcomes in the review. The trials that provided the information included people with cirrhosis due to varied aetiologies, with or without other features of decompensation, having ascites with low protein or previous history of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. The follow-up in the trials ranged from 1 to 12 months. Many of the trials were at high risk of bias, and the overall certainty of evidence was low or very low. Overall, approximately 10% of trial participants developed spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and 15% of trial participants died. There was no evidence of differences between any of the antibiotics and no intervention in terms of mortality (very low certainty) or number of serious adverse events (very low certainty). However, because of the wide CrIs, clinically important differences in these outcomes cannot be ruled out. None of the trials reported health-related quality of life or the proportion of people with serious adverse events. There was no evidence of differences between any of the antibiotics and no intervention in terms of proportion of people with 'any adverse events' (very low certainty), liver transplantation (very low certainty), or the proportion of people who developed spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (very low certainty). The number of 'any' adverse events per participant was fewer with norfloxacin (rate ratio 0.74, 95% CrI 0.59 to 0.94; 4 trials, 546 participants; low certainty) and sulfamethoxazole plus trimethoprim (rate ratio 0.19, 95% CrI 0.02 to 0.81; 1 trial, 60 participants; low certainty) versus no active intervention. There was no evidence of differences between the other antibiotics and no intervention in the number of 'any' adverse events per participant (very low certainty). There were fewer other decompensation events with rifaximin versus no active intervention (rate ratio 0.61, 65% CrI 0.46 to 0.80; 3 trials, 575 participants; low certainty) and norfloxacin plus neomycin (rate ratio 0.06, 95% CrI 0.00 to 0.33; 1 trial, 22 participants; low certainty). There was no evidence of differences between the other antibiotics and no intervention in the number of decompensations events per participant (very low certainty). None of the trials reported health-related quality of life or development of symptomatic spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. One would expect some correlation between the above outcomes, with interventions demonstrating effectiveness across several outcomes. This was not the case. The possible reasons for this include sparse data and selective reporting bias, which makes the results unreliable. Therefore, one cannot draw any conclusions from these inconsistent differences based on sparse data. There was no evidence of any differences in the subgroup analyses (performed when possible) based on whether the prophylaxis was primary or secondary.

Funding

the source of funding for five trials were organisations who would benefit from the results of the study; six trials received no additional funding or were funded by neutral organisations; and the source of funding for the remaining 18 trials was unclear.

Authors' Conclusions

Based on very low-certainty evidence, there is considerable uncertainty about whether antibiotic prophylaxis is beneficial, and if beneficial, which antibiotic prophylaxis is most beneficial in people with cirrhosis and ascites with low protein or history of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. Future randomised clinical trials should be adequately powered, employ blinding, avoid postrandomisation dropouts (or perform intention-to-treat analysis), and use clinically important outcomes such as mortality, health-related quality of life, and decompensation events.

### Diagnosis and management of cirrhosis and its complications… [^116BmY3F]. JAMA Network (2023). Excellent credibility.

The presence of cirrhosis is associated with an increased risk of complications such as liver cancer and decompensation including ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, and variceal hemorrhage. It is important to evaluate for the presence of cirrhosis in people with risk factors or any diagnosed chronic liver disease. Combination aldosterone antagonists and loop diuretics: hyperkalemia, kidney injury Aldosterone antagonists alone: hyperkalemia, kidney injury Not reported in trials of patients with ascites but observed in other trials of spironolactone: gynecomastia. The most common causes of cirrhosis in the US, which can overlap, include alcohol use disorder, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and hepatitis C. Patients with cirrhosis experience symptoms including muscle cramps, pruritus, poor-quality sleep, and sexual dysfunction.

Compared with sequential initiation, combination aldosterone antagonist and loop diuretics were more likely to resolve ascites with lower rates of hyperkalemia. In meta-analyses of randomized trials, lactulose was associated with reduced mortality relative to placebo in randomized trials involving 705 patients and reduced risk of recurrent overt hepatic encephalopathy in randomized trials involving 1415 patients. Most prevalent cases of cirrhosis are caused by alcohol use disorder, hepatitis C, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, with many patients having overlapping causes. 4 However, hepatitis C is now curable with direct-acting antivirals and most newly diagnosed cirrhosis is due to nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and alcohol use disorder.
5.

The causes of cirrhosis vary by context and many overlap. In a study of 68 673 patients from a national sample of patients in the Veterans Administration, the causes of cirrhosis were hepatitis C, alcohol related, hepatitis C and alcohol related, NAFLD related and decreased production of vasodilators, further restricting sinusoidal flow. Inflammatory injury from alcohol or steatosis also increases vascular resistance. In both NAFLD and alcohol-related liver disease, heritable factors in lipid metabolism have been associated with progression of liver disease. 57 In addition, chronic liver injury causes hepatocyte loss and reduces the liver's capacity for metabolic activity including protein synthesis, detoxification, nutrient storage, and bilirubin clearance.

Disrupted portal flow causes decreased cardiac return and decreased central blood volume, leading to increased plasma renin activity, increased renal-tubular affinity for sodium, peripheral volume expansion, and kidney vasoconstriction, predisposing patients to ascites, hyponatremia, and kidney injury, particularly in the setting of volume depletion, infection, or hemorrhage. Increasing portal pressure induces ascites from hepatic sinusoids. Increased sinusoidal pressure causes increased lymph production, which extravasates into the peritoneum when lymphatic drainage capacity is exceeded. Gut-derived toxins, such as ammonia and bacterial products that induce systemic inflammation, cause hepatic encephalopathy. Hepatic encephalopathy can develop at low ammonia levels in the context of infection.

Prophylactic therapy for SBP

Three groups at high risk of developing SBP have been identified: (i) patients with acute gastrointestinal (GI) haemorrhage; (ii) patients with a low ascitic protein concentration and no prior history of SBP (primary prophylaxis) and (iii) patients with a previous episode of SBP (secondary prophylaxis). Although antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent further infection in patients presenting to hospital with upper GI bleeding is established in clinical practice, there remains uncertainty over prophylaxis in other circumstances. Additional studies related to this area after the Cochrane revieware summarised in online supplemental table 1.

Primary prophylaxis

Primary prophylaxis is a controversial area and broad recommendations are not straightforward. In 2016 the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommended offering prophylactic oral ciprofloxacin or norfloxacin for people with cirrhosis and ascites and no history of SBP with an ascitic protein of ≤ 15 g/L (1.5 g/dL), until the ascites has resolved. Six studies were included in their analyses. The European Association for the Study of Liver (EASL) recommend primary prophylaxis with norfloxacin (400 mg/day) in patients with Child-Pugh score ≥ 9 and serum bilirubin ≥ 3 mg/dL, with either impaired renal function or hyponatraemia and ascitic fluid protein lower than 15 g/L. The American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) also suggest that antibiotics for primary prophylaxis of SBP should be considered for people at high risk of developing this complication, which was defined as an ascitic fluid protein < 1.5 g/dL together with impaired renal function or liver failure.

Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) is a feared complication of ascites that affects 10%-30% of hospitalized patients with cirrhosis with an associated mortality rate of approximately 20%. 1–3 Although efforts have been undertaken to encourage prompt evaluation and treatment of SBP, outcomes have generally remained dismal. 3 There is significant interest in identifying factors that can reliably predict mortality among individuals with SBP.

Prevention of HRS

HRS-AKI is most often precipitated by a precipitating event. Identifying and preventing the precipitating event is the key to the prevention of HRS-AKI. Several well-established strategies are recommended by various academic associations. These include regular monitoring of renal function when patients are started on diuretics, avoidance of excessive diuretics use, start regular LVP when patients have developed refractory ascites, use of albumin with LVP of > 5 l to prevent paracentesis-induced circulatory disturbances, prophylaxis against bacterial infection such as during an episode of gastrointestinal bleed or after an episode of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), as well as avoidance of nephrotoxic drugs or the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents.

As bacterial infections are the most common cause of HRS-AKI, primary prophylactic against SBP in patients with advanced liver disease defined as Child–Pugh score of ⩾9, a serum bilirubin level ⩾5 mg/dl, a sCr level of ⩾1.2 mg/dl, blood urea nitrogen level of ⩾42.6 mg/dl, and serum sodium of ≤ 130 mmol/l has been shown to be associated with reduced incidence of HRS and overall mortality. However, a recent prospective study found that primary prophylaxis against SBP was associated with a higher incidence of AKI (48% versus 30%; p = 0.04), and higher 90-day mortality (35% versus 22%; p = 0.02) compared to patients who were on secondary SBP prophylaxis, possibly related to changed microbiota with continued antibiotic use. It has been suggested that a personalized approach to antibiotic prophylaxis, weighing out risks and benefits, is the most appropriate strategy. The results of a recent network meta-analysis have thrown considerable uncertainty about whether antibiotic prophylaxis against SBP is beneficial, and if beneficial, which antibiotic prophylaxis is most beneficial in people with cirrhosis and ascites with low protein or history of SBP. Therefore, further studies are needed to better define this evolving issue.

Finally, long-term weekly albumin infusion to patients with decompensated cirrhosis and non-refractory ascites compared to standard of care has been shown to reduce the incidence of HRS and improved overall survival in a large RCT. However, this does not appear to be the definitive answer to the chronic use of albumin in these patients, as two further RCTs among liver transplant listed outpatients using albumin and midodrine versus placebo, or among admitted patients with decompensated cirrhosis did not prevent the development of complications including HRS.

### When to use antibiotics in the cirrhotic patient? The evidence base [^115snsfz]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

In cirrhotic patients with low protein ascites (< 1.5g/dL) but no prior SBP (primary prophylaxis), oral norfloxacin (400 mg/day) is recommended when Child-Pugh score is ≥ 9 points or if serum bilirubin level is ≥ 3 mg/dL or renal function is impaired (serum creatinine level ≥ 1.2 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen level ≥ 25 mg/dL, or serum sodium level ≤ 130 mEq/L). This has been shown to reduce the probability of SBP and hepatorenal syndrome and improved the 3-month survival. Likewise, oral ciprofloxacin (500 mg/day) will reduce the 1-year mortality rate in patients with ascitic protein levels < 1.5 g/dL without prior SBP episode.

In those patients who have had one previous episode of SBP, the cumulative recurrence rate at 1 year is 70%. Oral norfloxacin is recommended for secondary prophylaxis since it decreases the recurrence rate of SBP from 70% to 20%. Alternative antibiotics include ciprofloxacin (750 mg once weekly, orally) or co-trimoxazole (800 mg sulfamethoxazole and 160 mg trimethoprim daily, orally), but evidence is not as strong as with norfloxacin.

### Cirrhosis and chronic liver failure: part II. complications and treatment [^112RxNzd]. American Family Physician (2006). Low credibility.

Major complications of cirrhosis include ascites, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, hepatic encephalopathy, portal hypertension, variceal bleeding, and hepatorenal syndrome. Diagnostic studies on ascitic fluid should include a differential leukocyte count, total protein level, a serum-ascites albumin gradient, and fluid cultures. Therapy consists of sodium restriction, diuretics, and complete abstention from alcohol. Patients with ascitic fluid polymorphonuclear leukocyte counts of 250 cells per mm3 or greater should receive empiric prophylaxis against spontaneous bacterial peritonitis with cefotaxime and albumin. Patients who survive an episode of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis should receive long-term prophylaxis with norfloxacin or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. Patients with gastrointestinal hemorrhage and cirrhosis should receive norfloxacin or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole twice daily for seven days. Treatment of hepatic encephalopathy is directed toward improving mental status levels with lactulose; protein restriction is no longer recommended. Patients with cirrhosis and evidence of gastrointestinal bleeding should undergo upper endoscopy to evaluate for varices. Endoscopic banding is the standard treatment, but sclerotherapy with vasoconstrictors (e.g., octreotide) also may be used. Prophylaxis with propranolol is recommended in patients with cirrhosis once varices have been identified. Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt has been effective in reducing portal hypertension and improving symptoms of hepatorenal syndrome, and can reduce gastrointestinal bleeding in patients with refractory variceal hemorrhage. When medical therapy for treatment of cirrhosis has failed, liver transplantation should be considered. Survival rates in transplant recipients have improved as a result of advances in immunosuppression and proper risk stratification using the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease and Child-Turcotte-Pugh scoring systems.

### Daily norfloxacin vs. weekly ciprofloxacin to prevent spontaneous bacterial peritonitis: a randomized controlled trial [^113X57wm]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives

For the prevention of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) in cirrhotic patients with ascites, norfloxacin 400mg per day is recommended as a standard regimen. This study aims to investigate whether ciprofloxacin once weekly administration is not inferior to norfloxacin once daily administration for the prevention of SBP.

Methods

This is an investigator-initiated open-label randomized controlled trial conducted at seven tertiary hospitals in South Korea. Liver cirrhosis patients with ascites were screened, and enrolled in this randomized controlled trial if ascitic protein ≤ 1.5g/dL or the presence of history of SBP. Ascitic polymorphonucleated cell count needed to be < 250/mm³. Patients were randomly assigned into norfloxacin daily or ciprofloxacin weekly group, and followed-up for 12 months. Primary endpoint was the prevention of SBP.

Results

One hundred twenty-four patients met enrollment criteria and were assigned into each group by 1:1 ratio (62:62). Seven patients in the norfloxacin group and five patients in the ciprofloxacin group were lost to follow-up. SBP developed in four patients (4/55) and in three patients (3/57) in each group, respectively (7.3% vs. 5.3%, P = 0.712). The transplant-free survival rates at 1 year were comparable between the groups (72.7% vs. 73.7%, P = 0.970). Incidence of infectious complication, hepatorenal syndrome, hepatic encephalopathy, and variceal bleeding rates were not significantly different (all P = ns). The factors related to survival were models representing underlying liver function.

Conclusion

Once weekly ciprofloxacin was as effective as daily norfloxacin for the prevention of SBP in cirrhotic patients with ascites.

In contrast, in a large placebo-controlled randomised clinical trial, the NORFLOCIR trial, norfloxacin did not reduce 6-month mortality in patients with advanced cirrhosis, with > 95% of patients included having no history of prior SBP. In post-hoc analyses, norfloxacin, appeared to increase survival of patients with low ascites fluid protein concentrations. However, other data have failed to replicate an association of incidence of SBP in patients with pre-existing low total ascitic fluid protein concentration in three large cohorts of hospitalised patients with cirrhosis and ascites. Furthermore, there are concerns about the potential consequences of long-term oral antibiotic therapy, including resistance, increased risk of Clostridium difficile associated diarrhoea, adverse reactions and drug interactions. In 2019 the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) issued updated guidance on new restrictions and precautions for use of fluoroquinolone antibiotics following a detailed EU review of very rare reports of disabling and potentially longlasting or irreversible side effects affecting the musculoskeletal and nervous systems. Although SBP prophylaxis was not specifically considered, renal impairment is considered to increase this risk, and therefore healthcare professionals and patients should be vigilant during treatment with fluoroquinolone antibiotics and discontinue treatment at the first sign of tendon pain or inflammation. Finally, norfloxacin is not widely available in the UK.

In view of the uncertainties outlined above, we advocate primary prophylaxis is offered to patients considered at high risk, as defined by an ascitic protein count < 1.5 g/dL. However, it is important that the potential risks and benefits and existing uncertainties are communicated to patients.

It is expected that a large ongoing multicentre UK trial (European Union Drug Regulating Authorities Clinical Trials Database Registration Number: 2019-000581-38) to investigate the efficacy of long-term co-trimoxazole compared with placebo as primary prevention for SBP may deal with these uncertainties.

### Recurrence of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in cirrhosis: novel predictors [^111ubWVU]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Recurrence of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) is still a matter of debate. We conducted this study to evaluate the probable factors that predict the recurrence of SBP in patients who recovered from the first episode of SBP and the long-term outcomes of SBP recurrence.

Methods

One hundred twenty-four patients diagnosed with liver cirrhosis, SBP and did not receive secondary prophylaxis either with norfloxacin or other antibiotics were included in this prospective cohort pilot study. Clinical, biochemical and ascitic fluid analysis parameters were evaluated. Ascitic fluid interferon-γ-induced protein (IP-10), calprotectin, interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α were measured by ELISA.

Results

Of these, 76 patients survived with an in-hospital mortality rate of 38.7%. The survivors were classified into two groups according to recurrence and nonrecurrence of SBP and survival time, clinical parameters and cause of death were investigated. Thirty-one participants had one or more attacks of SBP, with a recurrence rate of 40.8% within one-year follow-up. Before discharge, multivariate analysis showed that ascitic IP-10 (≥ 1220pg/ml), ascitic calprotectin (≥ 550ng/ml), serum albumin (≤ 2.5g/dl), nonuse of prophylactic β-blockers and use of proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) were the independent variables in predicting recurrent SBP. Sepsis-related organ failure was the most common etiology of mortality in the recurrent SBP group within 3 and 6months.

Conclusion

Increased ascitic calprotectin and IP-10, hypoalbuminemia, nonuse of prophylactic β-blockers and use of PPI were independently associated with increased SBP recurrence rate. Sepsis-related organ failure was the most common etiology of mortality.

Preventing progression to hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) — the first principle is the treatment or prevention of possible precipitating factors, particularly gastrointestinal bleeding and bacterial infections, and avoiding LVP without albumin administration. For example, IV albumin, together with antibiotics, reduces the incidence of HRS-AKI and improves survival in patients with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), whereas albumin in patients with cirrhosis and bacterial infections other than SBP neither prevents HRS-AKI nor improves survival.

Patients and methods

Design

We conducted a cross-sectional study to develop a diagnostic model for the early and accurate diagnosis of SBP.

Study population

The retrospective study was conducted at Beijing You-An Hospital, Capital Medical University, The Fifth Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital, and Beijing Ditan Hospital between January 2017 and December 2018. We continuously recruited 1618 patients with ascites who underwent abdominal paracentesis. Data related to the clinical features, history, demographic information, physical examination, and laboratory test results were collected. Diagnostic abdominal paracentesis was routinely performed in all cirrhotic ascites patients as well as those with suspicion of SBP. Cirrhosis was diagnosed according to the diagnostic criteria suggested by the 2019 guidelines for the management of cirrhosis. The study included patients aged 18–90 years with cirrhosis and ascites. We excluded patients with any factors that may affect the diagnosis of SBP, namely antibiotic use, use of SBP prophylaxis, ascites without cirrhosis (such as due to pancreatitis, peritoneal cancer, tuberculosis, heart failure, kidney disease, or intraabdominal bleeding), malignant tumors, hematological diseases, abdominal surgery within the past 3 months, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal diseases (such as gastritis, enteritis, or intestinal obstruction), chemotherapy or radiation therapy within the past 1 month, pregnancy, secondary peritonitis, use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or contraceptives, bacterial infections other than SBP, recent bleeding, other causes of fever (such as HIV infection), other infections or diseases that may affect the blood, white blood cell (WBC) count or C-reactive protein (CRP) levels (e.g. skin or chest infections), or other diseases that can cause elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level (e.g. myocardial infarction or myositis). Patients underwent medical history, general examination, abdominal examination, abdominal ultrasound, laboratory tests, routine diagnostic abdominal paracentesis, and ascitic fluid analysis. Patients were divided into three groups: training, internal validation, and external validation. The training group included 70% of patients with liver cirrhosis and ascites (n = 757) from Beijing You-An Hospital and Beijing Ditan Hospital to develop the scoring system. The internal validation group included the remaining 30% of participants with liver cirrhosis and ascites (n = 324) to validate the diagnostic performance of this scoring system. The external validation group recruited patients (n = 367) from The Fifth Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital to further validate the model.

Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP)

Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis is the development of bacterial infection of ascites in the absence of any intra-abdominal surgically treatable source of infection. The prevalence of SBP in outpatients is 1.5–3.5% and approximately 10% in hospitalised patients. A recent European study detected a prevalence of 11.3% among inpatients. When first described, mortality associated with SBP exceeded 90%, but, in-hospital mortality has been reduced to approximately 20% with early diagnosis and prompt treatment. In an observational study, each hour of delay in diagnostic paracentesis after admission was associated with a 3.3% increase of in-hospital mortality after adjusting for model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score. Long-term survival remains poor; 1-year survival after hospitalisation with SBP in a UK study was found to be 34%. Patients recovering from an episode of SBP should always be considered as potential candidates for liver transplantation if they have not already been assessed.

Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) secondary prophylaxis — Patients with a prior episode of SBP are at a very high risk of SBP recurrence, and in a landmark multicenter randomized controlled trial, the 1-year probability of developing recurrent SBP was significantly lower with norfloxacin (20%) compared with placebo (68%). A reasonable alternative to norfloxacin is oral ciprofloxacin (500 mg/day), although direct evidence in support for this regimen is lacking. Limited comparative data indicate a single-center open-label randomized trial showed rifaximin had a lower 6-month incidence of recurrent SBP compared with norfloxacin (4% vs. 14%, respectively). Similarly, high-quality data in support of sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim for secondary prophylaxis are lacking, and to date, prevention of spontaneous bacteremia or SBE has not been studied.

### Outcomes in patients with cirrhosis on primary compared to secondary prophylaxis for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis [^116vdkCY]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Antibiotic prophylaxis is recommended for prevention of the first episode of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP; primary prophylaxis 1°) and subsequent episodes (secondary prophylaxis 2°). We aimed to compare outcomes in cirrhotic inpatients on 1° vs 2° SBP prophylaxis.

Methods

Data from North American Consortium for the Study of End-Stage Liver Disease were evaluated for cirrhosis details, reasons for admission/medications, inpatient course recorded, and outcomes over 90 days. Outcomes (intensive care units, acute kidney injury, inpatient/90-day mortality) were compared between the 2 groups after propensity-matching on admission model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score and serum albumin.

Results

Among the 2,731 patients enrolled, 305 were on 1° and 187 on 2° SBP prophylaxis. After propensity-matching, 154 patients remained in each group. Patients on 1° prophylaxis were more likely to have admission systemic inflammatory response syndrome (P = 0.02), with higher intensive care unit admissions (31% vs 21%; P = 0.05) and inpatient mortality (19% vs 9%; P = 0.01) than the 2° prophylaxis group. Patients on 2° prophylaxis had higher total (22% vs 10%; P = 0004), readmission (16% vs 9%; P = 0.03), and nosocomial (6% vs 0.5%; P = 0.01) SBP rates with predominant Gram-negative organisms compared to 1° prophylaxis patients. At 90 days, 1° prophylaxis patients had a higher mortality (35% vs 22%; P = 0.02) and acute kidney injury incidence (48% vs 30%; P = 0.04) compared to 2° prophylaxis patients.

Discussion

In this inpatient cirrhosis study, despite prophylaxis, a high proportion of patients developed SBP, which was associated with mortality. Cirrhotic inpatients on 1° prophylaxis had worse outcomes than those on 2° prophylaxis when propensity-matched for the MELD score and serum albumin during the index admission and 90-day follow-up.

Another trial in 2015 was conducted in Egypt by Shamseya and Madkour. They enrolled 86 patients in a prospective observational study. All patients had cirrhosis as a result of hepatitis C. They excluded patients with other aetiologies for cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma and hypersensitivity to the study drugs. More than 70% of patients received the medications for primary prophylaxis of SBP, while the rest received them for secondary prophylaxis. A prior episode of SBP was defined as ascitic fluid with > 250 PMNL. The groups were equally divided into the norfloxacin group, receiving 400 mg per day, and rifaximin group, receiving 1200 mg per day in three divided doses. They were matched for age, sex and Child-Pugh class. Renal function and ascitic fluid albumin concentrations were also similar across both groups. At the end of 1 year of follow-up, six patients developed SBP in the norfloxacin group (14%) compared with two patients in the rifaximin group (4.7%), with a p value of 0.265.

Assem et al conducted a multicentre randomised controlled trial to compare rifaximin, norfloxacin and combined therapy for primary prevention of SBP at five centres across Saudi Arabia and Egypt. All aetiologies for cirrhosis were included. Patients were enrolled so long as no prior history of SBP existed — defined as ascitic fluid > 250 PMNL. Patients with recent gastrointestinal bleeding or hepatocellular carcinoma were excluded. Patient were divided into three groups — norfloxacin 400 mg per day, rifaximin 1100 mg per day in two divided doses and alternating norfloxacin/rifaximin receiving 1100 mg per day rifaximin for 1 month alternating with 400 mg per day norfloxacin. The patients were followed up for a duration of 6 months. Thirty-four patients in the norfloxacin group (34/78 = 43.6%) developed SBP as compared with 26 patients in the rifaximin group (26/82 = 31.7%) with a p value of 0.121. These results were based on intention-to-treat principle, though data for per-protocol analysis were also presented. Of interest, in the comparison of all three groups, the highest rate of success in both intention-to-treat and per-protocol analysis was in the combined group which used alternating norfloxacin and rifaximin regimen.

### Rifaximin versus norfloxacin for prevention of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis: a systematic review [^117DnpCa]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Liver cirrhosis, a major global health burden, accounts for ∼1 million deaths every year. Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) is one of the most serious and life-threatening complications of cirrhosis, now carrying an in-hospital mortality of 16–23% in the USA. The proposed mechanism for development of SBP is translocation of intestinal bacteria into mesenteric lymph nodes and the ascitic fluid. On surviving an incident episode of SBP, the recurrence rate is ∼70% at 1 year. High recurrences coupled with substantial mortality warrant long-term antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent SBP. Various oral antibiotics have been studied to reduce the risk of occurrence and recurrence of SBP by achieving 'selective intestinal decontamination'. The American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) and European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) recommend norfloxacin, a systemic antibiotic, as the first-line therapy for this purpose.

Rifaximin is a broad-spectrum ansamicin antibiotic that is poorly absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract and thereby reaches high levels in the gut lumen. Its role as an initial and add-on therapy for hepatic encephalopathy has been well established. Moreover, it has recently been evaluated as a prophylactic antibiotic to reduce the risk of recurrence of SBP. We conducted a systematic review to compare rifaximin to the standard of care (norfloxacin) for primary or secondary prevention of SBP.

Ascites — initial evaluation includes abdominal ultrasonography with Doppler, complete blood count, liver function tests (INR, serum total bilirubin, serum albumin), renal function tests (serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen), serum and urine electrolytes (Na, K) and urine analysis with spot urine protein, and ascitic fluid analysis with serum albumin ascites gradient (SAAG), total protein concentration, polymorphonuclear leukocyte count, and culture. For ascitic fluid interpretation, a serum albumin ascites gradient < 1.1 g/dL suggests other causes of ascites, while a high ascitic fluid protein (> 2.5 g/dL) supports a cardiac source for ascites; other tests of the ascitic fluid, such as amylase, cytology, or culture for mycobacteria, are not routinely indicated but should be guided by the patient's clinical context.

Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) initial management — First-line empirical antibiotic therapy for community-acquired SBP/SBE is IV third-generation cephalosporin, whereas in patients with a health care–associated or nosocomial infection or recent exposure to broad-spectrum antibiotics or who are admitted with sepsis or septic shock, empirical therapy with broad-spectrum antibiotics should be initiated as the first line. Response to empirical antibiotic therapy may be assessed by repeating diagnostic paracentesis/thoracentesis 2 days after initiation, and a decrease in fluid PMN < 25% from baseline indicates lack of response and should lead to broadening of antibiotic coverage and further evaluation to rule out secondary bacterial peritonitis. Patients with SBP should be treated with IV albumin in addition to antibiotics (1.5 g/kg at day 1 and 1 g/kg at day 3), and patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) and/or jaundice at time of diagnosis of SBP are more likely to benefit from albumin. Nonselective beta blockers (NSBBs) should be temporarily held in patients with SBP who develop hypotension (mean arterial pressure < 65 mm Hg) or AKI.

### Association of proton pump inhibitor therapy with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in cirrhotic patients with ascites [^113txWTL]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2009). Low credibility.

Objectives

Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) is a frequent complication of cirrhosis. Bacterial contamination of ascites fluid leading to SBP is caused by bacterial translocation with subsequent bacteremia. Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) suppress gastric acid secretion, allowing bacterial colonization of the upper gastrointestinal tract, and may predispose to bacterial overgrowth and translocation. The aim of this study was to determine whether PPI use in cirrhotics with ascites is associated with SBP.

Methods

A retrospective case-control study was performed. Seventy cirrhotics admitted with paracentesis-proven SBP between 2002 and 2007 were matched 1:1 (for age and Child's class) with comparable cirrhotics with ascites who were admitted for conditions other than SBP. We excluded patients on chronic antibiotic prophylaxis or with antecedent gastrointestinal bleeding. Outpatient PPI use at the time of admission was compared between groups, and the effect of covariates was analyzed.

Results

Patients with SBP had a significantly higher rate of prehospital PPI use (69%) compared with ascitic cirrhotics hospitalized without SBP (31%, P = 0.0001). There was no significant difference in demographics, diabetes, etiology, or survival between groups. On multivariate analysis, PPI use was independently associated with SBP (odds ratio (OR) 4.31, confidence interval (CI) 1.34–11.7), and ascitic fluid protein was protective (OR 0.1, CI 0.03–0.25). In total, 47% of cirrhotic patients receiving PPI in this study had no documented indication for PPI treatment.

Conclusions

PPI therapy is associated with SBP in patients with advanced cirrhosis. Prospective studies are needed to determine whether PPI avoidance can reduce the incidence of SBP and improve outcomes.

Four studies were eligible for our systematic review (table 1). Three were randomised trials and one was a prospective longitudinal study. All studies were published in English language. Three studies were conducted in Egypt and one was a multicentre study involving centres in Egypt and Saudi Arabia. Baseline characteristics of the patients in individual studies were also examined (table 2).

In 2015, Mostafa et al conducted a single-centre randomised trial and enrolled 70 patients at the National Liver Institute in Egypt who were previously diagnosed with SBP — the definition of which was any prior ascitic fluid with > 250 PMNL, with or without positive culture, and an absence of other source of intraabdominal infection. The aetiology of cirrhosis in all patients was hepatitis C. Patients were excluded if they had hepatocellular carcinoma or active/recent gastrointestinal bleeding. Forty patients were assigned to the rifaximin group, receiving 800 mg per day, and 30 patients to the norfloxacin group, receiving 400 mg per day. Therapy was given for 6 months. Three months after initiation of therapy, there were five patients in the norfloxacin group (16.67%) who developed SBP compared with none in the rifaximin group. The study was designed specifically to measure outcomes of blood levels of liver function tests, cytokines and other markers of inflammation with time, thus no p value for the outcome of recurrent SBP was stated.

### Cirrhotic patients on proton pump inhibitors are at a twofold risk of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis independently of gastrointestinal bleeding: a population-based retrospective study [^115feZNS]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Cirrhosis is a well-known and prevalent chronic liver condition that has recently attracted interest from scientists seeking to research its economic and physical burden, as well as its mechanistic properties. Liver dysfunction in cirrhosis alters the immune system's humoral and cellular components and promotes bacterial translocations, making cirrhotic patients much more susceptible to infections and subsequently to decompensation. Bacterial infections are not only the most common complications seen among cirrhotic patients, but also the deadliest. The most renowned complications seen are spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), urinary tract infections, pneumonia, and bacteremia. SBP refers to the infection of the peritoneal fluid (or ascites) in the absence of an apparent source of intra-abdominal infection. SBP increases the morbidity and mortality burden associated with the disease. Cirrhotic patients with SBP are more likely to progress to sepsis, acute renal failure, gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), and hepatic encephalopathy.

The 1-year mortality rate of cirrhotic patients after infections has not changed significantly over the past decades, despite the tremendous advances in diagnosis and treatment. This underlines the need to find additional risk factors and implement better preventative strategies, rather than solely focusing on its treatment. Important known risk factors for SBP include upper GIB (prevented with β-blockers), previous episodes of SBP, a low concentration of ascitic protein (< 1.5 g/dL), alcohol consumption, and hepatitis B and C. Targeting these factors and looking for others remain key and cost-effective elements in controlling the disease progression.

On the same note, recent studies have suggested that patients with cirrhosis who use proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are at a higher risk for developing SBP than non-PPI users. However, many of these results are conflicting and lack generalizability. It is essential to tackle this subject, as PPI drugs are widely used among patient populations, particularly among cirrhotic patients. In this study, we aimed to identify whether PPI use is an independent risk factor for developing SBP among cirrhotic patients in the United States (US).

Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP)/spontaneous bacterial empyema (SBE) evaluation — patients with ascites due to cirrhosis emergently admitted to the hospital should undergo a diagnostic abdominal paracentesis to rule out SBP even in the absence of symptoms/signs of infection, and patients with ascites who develop signs, symptoms, or laboratory abnormalities suggestive of infection should undergo workup for infection plus a diagnostic abdominal paracentesis (for cell count and bacteriological culture); if the workup is negative and the patient has a pleural effusion, the patient should undergo a diagnostic thoracentesis; the ascitic fluid should be cultured at the bedside in aerobic and anaerobic blood culture bottles before initiation of antibiotics, and bedside inoculation of at least 10 mL of the ascitic sample into blood culture bottles increases the sensitivity of the culture to > 90% in the diagnosis of SBP; the diagnosis of SBP/SBE is established with a fluid polymorphonuclear (PMN) leukocyte count > 250/mm³.

Guidance statements — Moderate sodium restriction (2 g or 90 mmol/day) and diuretics (spironolactone with or without furosemide) are the first-line treatment in patients with cirrhosis and grade 2 ascites. After ascites is adequately mobilized, attempts should be made to taper the diuretics to the lowest dose necessary to maintain minimal or no ascites to prevent the development of adverse effects. Fluid restriction is not necessary for ascites management unless there is concomitant moderate or severe hyponatremia (serum sodium ≤ 125 mmol/L). In patients receiving diuretics, body weight and serum creatinine and sodium should be regularly monitored to assess response and to detect the development of adverse effects. Human albumin solution (20–40 g/week) or baclofen administration (10 mg/day, with a weekly increase of 10 mg/day up to 30 mg/day) may be helpful for muscle cramps.

### Addition of probiotics to norfloxacin does not improve efficacy in the prevention of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis: a double-blind placebo-controlled randomized-controlled trial [^114EBGyc]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) may occur despite antibiotic prophylaxis. We investigated whether the addition of probiotics to norfloxacin enhances its efficacy in the prevention of SBP.

Methods

A double-blind, randomized-controlled trial was conducted among consecutive cirrhotic patients who had either recovered from SBP (secondary prophylaxis) or who were at a high risk for the development of SBP (low ascitic fluid protein or serum bilirubin ≥ 2.5 mg/dl; primary prophylaxis). Norfloxacin 400 mg/day with probiotics capsules (Enterococcus faecalis JPC 30 million, Clostridium butyricum 2 million, Bacillus mesentericus JPC 1 million, Bacillus coagulans 50 million spores) at a dose of two capsules three times daily (group 1) or norfloxacin with a placebo (group 2) was given and the occurrence of SBP within a period of 6 months (primary endpoint) or side-effects of therapy and mortality (secondary endpoints) were recorded.

Results

From April 2005 through August 2007, 110 patients were randomized to group 1 (n = 55) or group 2 (n = 55) and 45 (82%) and 43 (78%) of them completed the trial, respectively. The baseline characteristics were comparable. On intention-to-treat analysis, the cumulative probability of treatment failures was similar in both the groups [19/55 (34%) in group 1 vs. 20/55 (36%) in group 2, P = 0.840]. The cumulative probability of mortality was also similar [13/45 (29%) in group 1 vs. 14/43 (32%) in group 2, P = 0.834]. The frequency of side-effects was also comparable. In subgroup analyses, the frequencies of SBP and deaths were similar in the two groups in the subgroups of primary and secondary prophylaxes. The presence of encephalopathy and serum bilirubin of greater than 3.65 mg/dl were found to predict mortality independently.

Conclusion

The addition of probiotics to norfloxacin does not improve its efficacy in primary or secondary prophylaxis of SBP or in reducing the mortality in cirrhotic patients with ascites.

Outpatient management of ascites

The onset of ascites signifies an important stage in cirrhosis evolution: the 2-year and 5-year cumulative mortality after ascites development is 38% and 78%, respectively.

Ascites is a clinical manifestation of portal hypertension related renal dysfunction, leading to sodium and water retention and impaired free water clearance. This presents progressively as ascites, refractory ascites, hyponatraemia and ultimately hepatorenal syndrome.

New-onset ascites should be evaluated to ensure it is related to portal hypertension, including calculating serum albumin gradient (SAAG) where SAAG > 11 g/L is consistent with portal hypertension. In the absence of another clear cause of decompensation, CT scan of the liver to rule out hepatocellular carcinoma or portomesenteric vein thrombosis should be considered. Any significant increase in the volume of ascites, abdominal pain or fever should prompt an ascitic tap with fluid sent for white cell count to rule out spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) and ascitic fluid culture. A neutrophil count of > 250/mm³ confirms SBP requiring prompt treatment with antibiotics.

Diagnostic paracentesis in new-onset ascites

Aspiration of ascitic fluid and its laboratory analysis is an essential step in the management of patients with newly diagnosed ascites. In cirrhosis, hepatic sinusoids are less permeable owing to fibrous tissue deposition, resulting in ascites with low protein content. It is important to estimate total protein level in ascites fluid; a concentration below 1.5 g/dL (or 15 g/L) is a risk factor for the development of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. In addition, serum ascites albumin gradient (SAAG) should be estimated routinely. A cut-off point of 1.1 g/dL (or 11 g/L) differentiates between causes of ascites with high sensitivity, although alternative causes should be considered based on the clinical scenario (table 1).

Table 1
Grouping of aetiology of ascites based on serum albumin ascites gradient (SAAG)

Hepatic sinusoids are normally permeable in heart failure, which allows for leakage of protein-rich lymph into the abdominal cavity and therefore, total protein concentration in ascitic fluid is high (> 2.5 g/dL) in combination with a high SAAG. In such a situation, measurement of brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) in the serum ± ascites is useful. Total protein concentrations > 2.5 g/dL within the ascites and serum BNP > 364 ng/L are suggestive of underlying or additional cardiac disease, whereas serum protein values < 182 ng/L rule out cardiac disease.

In low SAAG states, clinical context and imaging should guide the investigational approach. The yield for positive cytology in the context of malignancy is variable, ranging from 0% to 96.7%, in part determined by the site of the tumour. Combining cytology with tumour markers in the ascitic fluid may increase the positive predictive value (PPV), specifically the use of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM), CA 15–3 and CA 19–9. However, CA 125 in the serum or ascites has no role as a discriminator and will commonly be elevated by the presence of ascites from any cause.

The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

Table 1 — Recommendations on medications and prophylaxis for infection in cirrhosis state that in patients with cirrhosis with a history of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), we suggest use of antibiotics for secondary SBP prophylaxis to prevent recurrent SBP. In patients with cirrhosis in need of primary SBP prophylaxis, we suggest daily prophylactic antibiotics, although no one specific regimen is superior to another, to prevent SBP. In patients with cirrhosis, we suggest avoiding proton pump inhibitor (PPI) unless there is a clear indication because PPI increases the risk of infection.

Acute kidney injury prevention in cirrhosis — key measures emphasize that the use of albumin in addition to antibiotics is recommended in patients with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) to prevent HRS-AKI and subsequent organ failures but not recommended in non-SBP infections, with additional strategies including judicious use of laxatives and diuretics, albumin infusions with large-volume paracentesis, prompt treatment of gastrointestinal bleeds with antibiotic prophylaxis in established gastrointestinal bleeds, avoidance of nephrotoxic drugs or radiographic dye, and primary SBP prophylaxis in high-risk individuals with secondary prophylaxis after the first SBP episode; because repeated AKI episodes can lead to chronic kidney disease (CKD) and CKD predisposes to AKI, treating causes of CKD is important to break the AKI/CKD cycle.

### Bacterial DNA induces the complement system activation in serum and ascitic fluid from patients with advanced cirrhosis [^112ecpJp]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2007). Low credibility.

Translocation of intestinal bacteria to ascitic fluid is, probably, the first step in the development of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in patients with cirrhosis. Proteins of the complement system are soluble mediators implicated in the host immune response to bacterial infections and its activation has been traditionally considered to be an endotoxin-induced phenomenon. The aim of this study was to compare the modulation of these proteins in response to the presence of bacterial DNA and/or endotoxin in patients with advanced cirrhosis and ascites in different clinical conditions. Groups I and II consisted of patients without/with bacterial DNA. Group III included patients with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and Group IV with patients receiving norfloxacin as secondary long-term prophylaxis of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. Serum and ascitic fluid levels of endotoxin and truncated residues of the complement system were measured by ELISA. The complement system is triggered in response to bacterial DNA, as evidenced by significantly increased levels of C3b, membrane attack complex, and C5a in patients from Groups II and III compared with patients without bacterial DNA (Group I) and those receiving norfloxacin (Group IV). Gram classification did not further differentiate the immune response between patients within groups II and III, even though endotoxin levels were, as expected, significantly higher in patients with bacterial DNA from gram-negative microorganisms. The complement protein activation observed in patients with bacterial DNA in blood and ascitic fluid is indistinguishable from that observed in patients with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and may occur in an endotoxin-independent manner.

Table 1
Demographic, clinical and laboratory characteristics of the participants (n = 77)

The inclusion criteria for the study were: 1) age > 18 years; 2) diagnosis of cirrhosis with ascites; 3) hospital admission; and 4) informed consent from the patient or from a first-degree relative, if the patient was encephalopathic. The exclusion criteria were: 1) age < 18 years; 2) unwillingness to provide informed consent; 3) extrahepatic malignancies; 4) no available data on ascitic fluid; 5) source of infection additional to SBP; and 6) non-cirrhotic portal hypertension.

All patients admitted to the hospital with any of the following underwent abdominal paracentesis on presentation: fever or signs of systemic inflammation, abdominal pain, shock, altered mental status, gastrointestinal bleeding, worsening of liver and/or renal function, or any degree of hepatic encephalopathy. Ascitic fluid was directly inoculated into blood culture bottles (BACT/ALERT® Culture media, BIOMERIEUX, Inc. Durham, NC). The volume inoculated was at least 10 mL for aerobic and 10 mL for anaerobic culture, and this was performed at the patient's bedside. Detailed data on cell count, protein and albumin concentration, as well as microbe sensitivities, were collected and analyzed. SBP was diagnosed as an infection of ascitic fluid without any intra-abdominal surgically treatable source of infection, and was based on a neutrophil count > 250/mm³ in ascitic fluid, as determined by microscopy or positive culture of the ascitic fluid according to the guidelines of the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL). On admission, all patients had a broad biochemical evaluation, arterial blood gases and baseline liver imaging (ultrasound or computed tomography) to exclude malignancy or other source of infection.

Similarly, the role of albumin for improving outcomes in patients with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis is unclear. The trial data specific to this patient population are limited. The two largest RCTs failed to provide an explicit fluid resuscitation protocol for the patients randomized to no albumin, raising the concern for underresuscitation in the control arms of both studies. When similar albumin dosing strategies were used in trials examining patients with cirrhosis and extraperitoneal infections, no benefit was seen and concern for harm was expressed. The panel suggested the use of albumin for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (conditional recommendation), but raised concerns regarding the dosing protocol used in two of the four trials and the risk of fluid overload (1.5 g/kg on day 1 and 1.0 g/kg on day 3) and the lack of data suggesting this specific regimen is beneficial compared with alternative dosing (eg, lower dose daily for 3 days). The panel also considered the lack of clarity on whether albumin is necessary for all patients with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis or whether it could be used selectively (ie, patients at high risk of kidney failure or death: serum bilirubin > 4 mg/dL or serum creatinine > 1 mg/dL). Additional studies are necessary to address dosing, to address the benefit for patients with and without kidney impairment, and to clarify the risks of adverse events. The panel also noted that not all physicians currently adhere to the trial dosing strategy, although it continues to be recommended in current guidelines. A careful assessment of the patient's volume status, cardiovascular status, and degree of kidney impairment before transfusion is advised and the dose, frequency, or both being modified accordingly. In contrast, the RCTs find no support for the use of albumin in patients with cirrhosis and extraperitoneal infections.

### Randomized-controlled trial of rifaximin versus norfloxacin for secondary prophylaxis of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis [^113Gj5f1]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2016). Low credibility.

Background and Aims

Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) is a serious complication of liver cirrhosis with a high recurrence rate and a marked increase in mortality. Norfloxacin is used widely for the secondary prophylaxis of SBP; however, its extensive long-term use has led to an increase in the incidence of quinolone-resistant and Gram-positive SBP. Rifaximin is a nonabsorbable broad-spectrum antibiotic and does not appear to promote emergence of resistance. The aim of this study was to compare the safety and efficacy of rifaximin versus norfloxacin for the secondary prevention of SBP in patients with liver cirrhosis and ascites.

Materials and Methods

Two hundred and sixty two cirrhotic patients with ascites and a previous episode of SBP were assigned randomly to receive either 1200mg rifaximin or 400mg of norfloxacin daily for 6 months. All patients were monitored clinically each month and with ascitic fluid examination at the end of 2 and 6 months if not clinically suspected of recurrence earlier.

Results

Recurrence of SBP was significantly lower in the rifaximin group (3.88 vs. 14.13%) compared with the norfloxacin group (P = 0.04). The mortality rate was significantly decreased in the rifaximin group (13.74 vs. 24.43%) compared with the norfloxacin group (P = 0.044). The causes of death between the two groups did not show a significant difference (P = 0.377), but encephalopathy-related deaths were three folds higher in the norfloxacin group. There was a significant decrease in the side effects in the rifaximin group versus the norfloxacin group (P = 0.033).

Conclusion

Rifaximin was more effective than norfloxacin in the secondary prevention of SBP. Encephalopathy-related mortality and side effects were fewer in the rifaximin group.

### Management of patients with cirrhosis in Southern California: results of a practitioner survey [^1151W2a2]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2006). Low credibility.

Introduction

Cirrhosis is an important medical and public health concern. A paucity of data exists on how patients with cirrhosis are managed. Our aims were to determine how cirrhosis is managed and whether current management practices follow established recommendations.

Methods

A questionnaire was mailed to Southern California Society of Gastroenterology members. Most had practiced for more than 15 years (67%) in a private practice setting (69%). Proportions of physicians who followed established guidelines versus those who had not were compared using chi test.

Results

Hepatitis A, hepatitis B, influenza, and pneumococcus vaccinations were recommended by most respondents. Ninety-one percent of respondents routinely screened patients for hepatocellular carcinoma. A significantly greater proportion of respondents screened for hepatocellular carcinoma using either alpha-fetoprotein or ultrasound every 6 months (P < 0.05). Seventy-six percent recommended antibiotic prophylaxis in patients with prior spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, whereas less than half recommended prophylaxis in patients with ascitic protein fluid < 1 g/dL, current variceal bleed, and those on the liver transplant list. Sixty-seven percent of respondents performed screening esophagogastroduodenoscopy upon diagnosis of cirrhosis. Most respondents did not recommend repeating endoscopy in 1 to 2 years if a patient was found to have small varices (P < 0.05), and would repeat an endoscopy if large varices were found (P < 0.05).

Conclusion

The management of patients with cirrhosis in the community varied and did not always conform to established guidelines. These results should be confirmed in a larger group of physicians, and the rationales for physicians accepting or rejecting established guidelines should be further assessed.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) in cirrhosis — proposed diagnostic and management algorithm begins when there is an "Acute rise in creatinine by ≥ 0.3mg/dL", followed by "Clinical assessment including urinary sediment and biomarkers" and determining if a "Specific diagnosis" is identified; urinary markers guide etiology, as "Urinary sediments and biomarkers (particularly NGAL) may indicate ATN, whereas fractional excretion of sodium < 1% may suggest HRS". If no specific diagnosis is made, the branch evaluates "Creatinine doubled from baseline?"; management emphasizes risk factor correction, and if there is "No resolution in 1–2 days" or a "further rise in serum creatinine", proceed to albumin challenge: "Risk factor management, if applicable Give albumin (1g/kg) for 2 days". After albumin, assess "Meets the criteria for HRS"; if yes, determine "Vasoconstrictor therapy candidate?" and administer vasoconstrictor therapy if appropriate, while if no, use "Individualized nephrology care". Risk factor management includes "the withdrawal of nephrotoxic drugs, reduction or withdrawal of diuretics, detection, and treatment of infections, if present, and volume replacement (if severely volume-depleted) using 5% albumin or crystalloids, preferentially balanced, initially".

### Rifaximin versus norfloxacin for prevention of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis: a systematic review [^115sSNcT]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

Aim

The aim of this systematic review is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of rifaximin in the prophylaxis of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) as compared with norfloxacin.

Methods

We searched MEDLINE, CINAHL, Google Scholar and Cochrane databases from inception to January 2017. Reference lists of articles as well as conference proceedings were manually screened. We included studies that recruited patients with cirrhosis and ascites who met the criteria for primary or secondary SBP prophylaxis as defined by the European Association for the Study of the Liver and American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases. Two independent investigators reviewed the studies for eligibility, extracted the data and assessed study quality using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. The primary outcome was occurrence of SBP. Secondary outcomes included mortality and adverse events with therapy.

Results

Of the 435 studies identified, a total of five were included for full-text review. Four studies were eligible for the systematic review, three of which were randomised controlled trials and one was a prospective observational study. The population examined in majority of studies was primarily hepatitis C cirrhosis. The results of individual studies indicated either superior efficacy of rifaximin or no statistical difference between rifaximin and norfloxacin for SBP prophylaxis.

Conclusions

Moderate-quality evidence shows that long-term use of rifaximin appears to be a reasonable alternative to norfloxacin for SBP prevention in hepatitis C cirrhosis.

Treatment of grade 3 ascites — initial management states that for patients presenting with tense ascites, large-volume paracentesis (LVP) combined with hyperoncotic human albumin is the initial treatment of choice, even in the presence of hyponatremia. Patients with massive peripheral edema may require a second paracentesis shortly after the first because a rapid shift of fluid may occur from interstitial to ascitic cavity. After LVP and a significant reduction in the intra-abdominal pressure, diuretics can be instituted, which may eliminate or reduce the frequency of paracentesis.

Refractory ascites — continued diuretic use: In diuretic‑resistant ascites, the continued use of diuretics is ineffective and produces significant side effects; once the ceiling dose is reached, further dose increases will not increase renal sodium excretion, and this ceiling dose is reduced in cirrhosis compared with healthy controls. In diuretic intractable ascites, there are no data on whether resuming lower diuretic doses after side effects abate is beneficial.

Refractory ascites (RA) dietary and fluid management guidance states that continued dietary sodium restriction (< 2 g/day) is required in patients with RA to reduce the rate of ascites accumulation. Fluid restriction is ineffective for the management of RA, but restricting fluid intake to less than 1,000 mL/day is recommended for treatment of hyponatremia (e.g., < 125 mEq/L).

### Diagnosis, evaluation, and management of ascites, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and hepatorenal syndrome: 2021 practice guidance by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^114jpGc3]. Hepatology (2021). High credibility.

Dietary sodium restriction and diuretic therapy — Moderate dietary sodium restriction (2 g or 90 mmol/day) should be prescribed to achieve a negative sodium balance and net fluid loss, and fluid restriction is not indicated unless hyponatremia is present; a formal consultation with a dietician should be considered. In most patients with cirrhosis presenting with ascites, dietary sodium restriction alone is insufficient and diuretic therapy is necessary. Aldosterone antagonists (e.g., spironolactone) and loop diuretics (e.g., furosemide, torsemide, bumetanide) are the mainstay of diuretic treatment of cirrhotic ascites, and the recommended initial dose of spironolactone is 100 mg/day. Two studies addressing the best way to use these diuretics showed that for the first episode of ascites, treatment with aldosterone antagonists alone generated an adequate response with fewer side effects, whereas those with long-standing ascites responded better to a combined diuretic treatment.

### Clinical outcomes and care for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis: a national cohort study [^116zJJij]. Hepatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) leads to high rates of acute kidney injury (AKI), hepatorenal syndrome, and mortality. Population-based studies on contemporary SBP epidemiology are needed to inform care. In a large, national cohort of patients diagnosed with SBP and confirmed by ascitic fluid criteria, we characterized ascitic fluid characteristics, in-hospital and 12-month mortality, AKI, and recurrent SBP.

Approach and Results

We investigated how individual and bundled quality measures for SBP associated with outcomes after multi-level adjustment for health-system, patient clinical factors, and quality measures. Individual and bundled quality metrics were inpatient antibiotics within 48 hours, i.v. albumin, repeat paracentesis within 48 hours, recognition of SBP, and prophylactic antibiotics upon discharge. Among 4330 patients with newly diagnosed SBP, in-hospital mortality was 15.5%, and 12-month mortality was 56.6%. The incidence of stage 1 AKI was 26.6%, 15.7% for stage 2, and 22.8% for stage 3. The cumulative incidence of recurrent SBP was 10.3%. Guideline-recommended albumin was the only individual metric associated with reduced in-hospital mortality (HR: 0.73, 95% CI: 0.59–0.91). Receipt of a higher number of metrics from the SBP bundle was associated with progressively lower 12-month post-discharge mortality: patients who received 3, 4, and 5 SBP bundle components had 20%, 38%, and 56% lower hazard of mortality, respectively, relative to those receiving 2 or fewer (all p < 0.001). The SBP bundle was associated with a lower incidence of stage 3 versus stage 0–2 AKI (OR: 0.66, 95% CI: 0.51–0.86).

Conclusions

Prospective implementation of evidence-based SBP bundles may improve care outcomes and mortality in SBP.

### Rifaximin versus norfloxacin for prevention of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis: a systematic review [^117QMzV2]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

Another trial was conducted by Elfert et al, who enrolled a total of 262 patients with cirrhosis and one prior episode of SBP — again defined as ascitic fluid with > 250 PMNL. Follow-up period was 6 months, with patients enrolled to receive either norfloxacin 400 mg per day or rifaximin 1200 mg per day in three divided doses. The recurrence rate of SBP was 3.9% in the rifaximin group compared with 14.1% in the norfloxacin group, with a p value of 0.04 when analysing the reported per-protocol results.

Question 2: Mortality benefit with rifaximin as compared with norfloxacin

Elfert et al observed a distinct mortality benefit with rifaximin (13.8% vs 24.4%), which was statistically significant when compared with norfloxacin with a p value of 0.044. Both trials from Shamseya and Madkour and Assem et al demonstrated a numerical difference in mortality rates between rifaximin and norfloxacin groups, though they were not statistically significant. Shamseya and Madkour showed a reduction in mortality rate from 9.3% in the norfloxacin compared with 7% with rifaximin group. Assem et al similarly showed a reduction in mortality rate with the rifaximin group (2.4%) versus the norfloxacin group (7.6%). There were no deaths during the 6 month follow-up in the Mostafa et al study groups. The leading causes of mortality across all studies were hepatorenal syndrome, sepsis, variceal bleeding and hepatic encephalopathy.

Question 3: Safety profile of rifaximin as compared with norfloxacin

No serious adverse events were reported in any of the trials with either of the drugs. Minor adverse events such nausea, abdominal pain, flatulence and headache were reported, with similar incidences in the trials conducted by Shamseya and Madkour and Assem et al. The Elfert et al trial, however, reported a statistically significant lower overall incidence of these adverse events in the rifaximin group as compared with norfloxacin (p = 0.033). Though the adverse symptom event rates were different, they did not appear to be limiting enough to suspend consumption of the drug or alter the outcomes of SBP or death.

Ascitic fluid culture

Ascites culture is essential to help guide antibiotic therapy. Patients with 'culture-negative neutrocytic ascites' (PMN count > 250 cells/mm³) have a similar presentation to those with culture-positive SBP. As both groups of patients have significant morbidity and mortality, they should be treated in a similar manner. Some patients have 'bacterascites' in which cultures are positive, but, ascitic neutrophil count is < 250 cells/mm³. In some patients, bacterascites represents a transient and spontaneously reversible colonisation of ascites, in others, particularly those who are symptomatic, it may represent the first step in the development of SBP. Discussion with microbiologists about the organism cultured can help differentiate the above two scenarios, and when a positive culture is obtained a repeat tap should be sent to guide management.

Although the identification of pathogen(s) is essential for the management of infectious diseases, ascites fluid cultures often fail to provide positive results, even when using ascites samples from patients who develop clinical manifestations of SBP. Bacterial DNA detection and sequencing have been applied to the diagnosis of several infectious diseases, and molecular techniques can detect small amounts of bacterial DNA within a few hours. These promising techniques have yet to be introduced into routine clinical practice.

Fungal peritonitis is a rare, less studied complication and observational data suggest a worse prognosis. In a large multicentre study of 2743 cirrhotic inpatients, of whom 1052 had infections, 12.7% of infected patients had evidence of fungal infections with a case fatality of 30%. The majority of these were urinary, but the highest mortality was seen with fungaemia and peritonitis (case fatality > 50%).

Secondary bacterial peritonitis

A small proportion of patients with cirrhosis may develop peritonitis secondary to perforation or inflammation of an intra-abdominal organ, known as secondary bacterial peritonitis. In a small retrospective analysis, secondary peritonitis represented 4.5% of all peritonitis in cirrhotic patients. This should be suspected in those who have localised abdominal symptoms or signs, very high ascitic neutrophil count, the presence of multiple organisms on ascitic culture or in those with inadequate response to treatment. Cross-sectional imaging, such as CT, should be performed with early consideration of surgery in this scenario.

### British society of gastroenterology best practice guidance: outpatient management of cirrhosis-part 2: decompensated cirrhosis [^111VxjaL]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

The mainstay of ascites management in the outpatient setting is diuretic therapy. This involves a stepwise approach as outlined in figure 3 with the additional specific recommendations:

Secondary antibiotic prophylaxis should be considered in patients with a previous episode of SBP. Suitable antibiotic choices are norfloxacin 400 mg, ciprofloxacin 500 mg or co-trimoxazole 960 mg once daily. The ASEPTIC trial, investigating the role of primary prophylaxis of SBP, is ongoing. Some centres offer primary prophylaxis for those considered high risk of SBP (protein concentration < 15 g/L)but there are concerns around antibiotic resistance and this should only be considered following discussion with local microbiology teams. Rifaximin prescribed for secondary prophylaxis of HE may negate the prescription of a second oral systemic antibiotic with substantial evidence to suggest it prevents SBP.
NSBB, when indicated, is not contraindicated in refractory ascites; although patients require close monitoring; dose reduction or discontinuation may be appropriate in those who develop hypotension or acute/progressive renal dysfunction.
Long-term outpatient albumin administration to patients with cirrhosis and ascites is not currently recommended: despite encouraging results from the ANSWER trial, the accompanying medical supervision was a strong confounding variable; further research is required to determine the efficacy, practicality, cost-effectiveness and impact on quality of life.
Patients with refractory ascites requiring regular large-volume paracentesis should have them performed as planned day case procedures as this reduces costs and improves patient outcomes, particularly in the last year of life.
Indwelling abdominal drains remain experimental but can be considered in palliative patients with advanced disease as an alternative to recurrent large volume paracentesis following careful discussion involving the patient about the risk benefit ratio, and in particular the potential infection risk. Their use is currently being evaluated in the REDUCe2 trial.

Bacterial infections in cirrhosis — epidemiology and acquisition categories indicate that bacterial infections are present in approximately one-third of patients with cirrhosis who are hospitalized, and spontaneous infections accounted for 36% of infections, followed by urinary tract infection (22%), pneumonia (19%), and skin/soft tissue infections (8%). Approximately half of infections were community acquired and present at or within the first 48 hours of admission with no prior contact with a health care facility for > 90 days; a quarter was health care associated (diagnosed within 48 hours of admission in patients with contact with a health care facility < 90 days), and the remaining 25% were nosocomial, defined as acquisition of the infection > 48 hours after admission.

Baseline investigations

On admission, it is vital that patients presenting with decompensated cirrhosis have a full history and clinical examination to look for the cause of deterioration in liver function, infection or evidence of GI bleeding. The National Early Warning Score should be recorded and used to monitor the patient's physiological status. Blood tests should be taken to assess liver and renal function, and this should include: full blood count, urea and electrolytes (including calcium/phosphate/magnesium), liver function tests, coagulation profile and glucose. As sepsis is a frequent cause of admission, patients should also be screened for infection with clinical examination, urinalysis and urine culture, chest X-ray, blood cultures and C-reactive protein (CRP). Although not always a routine test, serum CRP levels can help detect infection in cirrhotic patients early. One study showed that a CRP level greater than 10 mg/L was predictive of infections in patients with cirrhosis (area under the receiver operator curve 0.93, sensitivity 84%, specificity 91%), although the CRP can be elevated for other reasons, such as alcoholic hepatitis.

Additionally, an ascitic tap should be performed for all patients who have clinically detectable ascites to exclude spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). Coagulopathy is not a contraindication to this procedure, and measures to correct coagulopathy are NOT required. Ascitic fluid should be sent to the lab for analysis of the fluid: polymorphonuclear (PMN) and white cell count, microscopy and culture, protein and albumin content. An abdominal ultrasound should be requested and performed at the earliest opportunity (unless an ultrasound has been conducted in the last month), ideally within 24 h, and should include an assessment of portal vein patency.

Stages of acute kidney injury (AKI) — serum creatinine criteria: Stage 1 is defined as an increase of creatinine ≥ 0.3 mg/dL up to 2-fold of baseline, stage 2 as an increase in creatinine between 2- and 3-fold of baseline, and stage 3 as an increase in creatinine > 3-fold of baseline or creatinine > 4 mg/dl (353.6 μmol/l) with an acute increase ≥ 0.3 mg/dL (26.5 μmol/l) or initiation of RRT. Within stage 1, some members proposed subdividing into stage 1A (creatinine < 1.5 mg/dL) and stage 1B (creatinine ≥ 1.5 mg/dL).

Secondary prophylaxis

In patients who survive an episode of SBP, the cumulative recurrence rate at 1 year is approximately 70%. Probability of survival at 1 year after an episode of SBP is 30–50% and falls to 25–30% at 2 years. There is only one randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of norfloxacin (400 mg/day) in patients who had a previous episode of SBP; treatment reduced the probability of recurrence of SBP from 68% to 20%. A recent systematic review with meta-analysis concluded that rifaximin may be effective for both primary and secondary SBP prophylaxis compared with systemically absorbed antibiotics and compared with no intervention. However, additional prospective studies are required before a change in clinical practice can be recommended. It has been suggested that proton pump inhibitor use may increase the risk for the development of SBP and indications for long-term use should be carefully assessed.

We therefore recommend norfloxacin 400 mg once a day as secondary prophylaxis, although in view of limited availability in the UK, many centres use once daily ciprofloxacin 500 mg once a day as an alternative.

Regarding medical management for liver cirrhosis, more specifically with respect to prevention of SBP, primary prevention, BASL/BSG 2021 guidelines recommend to administer prophylactic antibiotic treatment (chosen based on local data) to prevent the development of SBP in patients presenting with gastrointestinal bleeding and underlying ascites due to cirrhosis.
