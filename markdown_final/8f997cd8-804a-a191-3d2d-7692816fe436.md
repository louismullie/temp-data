## Question

A previously healthy 10-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department for the evaluation of one episode of vomiting and severe headache since this morning. His mother says he also had difficulty getting dressed on his own. He has not had any trauma. The patient appears nervous. His temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 100/min, and blood pressure is 185/125 mm Hg. He is confused and oriented only to person. Ophthalmic examination shows bilateral optic disc swelling. There is an abdominal bruit that is best heard at the right costovertebral angle. A complete blood count is within normal limits. Which of the following is most likely to confirm the diagnosis?

Answer Choices:
A. Echocardiography
B. Oral sodium loading test
C. CT angiography
D. High-dose dexamethasone suppression test

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which test would most likely confirm the diagnosis in a 10-year-old with severe hypertension, altered mental status, papilledema, and a right costovertebral abdominal bruit. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the most likely diagnosis and whether this is a hypertensive emergency. Then, I should verify which secondary cause is suggested by the bruit and severe hypertension. Next, I will review the diagnostic options and match them to the suspected etiology. Finally, I will confirm the best confirmatory test and briefly consider immediate management implications.

> Let me first confirm the clinical syndrome. A blood pressure of 185/125 mmHg in a child with confusion, papilledema, and vomiting constitutes a hypertensive emergency with probable hypertensive encephalopathy and optic disc swelling indicating severe hypertensive retinopathy; this mandates urgent blood pressure control and evaluation for secondary causes, not routine outpatient confirmation strategies [^111q6zeP] [^113xkC4Q].

> Wait, let me verify the most likely secondary cause. A right costovertebral abdominal bruit in a child with severe hypertension strongly suggests renovascular disease, particularly renal artery stenosis, which is a classic clue prompting vascular imaging in secondary hypertension workups [^1136XsxT] [^113aXSur].

> I will now examine the answer choices against this hypothesis. Echocardiography can assess cardiac effects of chronic hypertension but will not identify a renovascular lesion; an oral sodium loading test is used to confirm primary aldosteronism, not renovascular disease; a high-dose dexamethasone suppression test evaluates Cushing's syndrome, which is not suggested here; CT angiography directly visualizes the renal arteries and is a recommended modality when renovascular hypertension is suspected, making it the most appropriate confirmatory test in this scenario [^1136t7QG] [^115LjBMM].

> Hold on, I should verify guideline alignment. Multiple high-credibility sources advise using vascular imaging such as CT angiography, MR angiography, or duplex ultrasound when renovascular hypertension is suspected, particularly with resistant or severe hypertension, abrupt onset, or an abdominal bruit, which fits this presentation precisely [^1136t7QG] [^115LjBMM] [^1136XsxT].

> But wait, what if I'm missing an endocrine cause like pheochromocytoma given the severity? Let me reconsider. While catecholamine excess can cause severe hypertension, the abdominal bruit is not a feature of pheochromocytoma, and the clinical clue here points more convincingly to renovascular disease; nonetheless, if clinical suspicion for catecholamine excess were high, plasma metanephrines would be the right biochemical test, not any of the listed options, so CT angiography remains the best choice among the provided alternatives for confirming the anatomic lesion [^115LjBMM].

> I should double-check pediatric implications. In children, secondary hypertension is more common than in adults, and renovascular etiologies are well recognized; thus, proceeding to targeted vascular imaging is appropriate when clinical clues are present, as they are here [^1169VjpN] [^1153HmNH].

> Final answer: CT angiography is the most likely test to confirm the diagnosis of renovascular hypertension in this child with severe hypertension, altered mental status, papilledema, and a right costovertebral abdominal bruit [^1136t7QG] [^115LjBMM].

---

The most likely diagnosis is **renovascular hypertension** due to renal artery stenosis, given the severe hypertension, abdominal bruit, and neurologic symptoms. The most appropriate confirmatory test is **CT angiography** [^1136t7QG] because it rapidly and accurately identifies renal artery stenosis, guides intervention, and is preferred in this acute setting over MR angiography or duplex ultrasound [^115LjBMM]. Echocardiography is not diagnostic for renovascular disease, and the sodium loading and dexamethasone tests are for endocrine causes, not vascular stenosis.

---

## Clinical reasoning and differential diagnosis

The presentation of severe hypertension (185/125 mmHg) with neurologic symptoms (confusion, difficulty dressing) and bilateral optic disc swelling in a 10-year-old boy strongly suggests **hypertensive encephalopathy** [^116XQBxV] due to acute severe hypertension. The presence of an abdominal bruit at the right costovertebral angle further supports a renovascular etiology, specifically renal artery stenosis, as the underlying cause of secondary hypertension [^115LjBMM].

Differential diagnosis includes:

- **Renovascular hypertension**: Renal artery stenosis causing secondary hypertension [^1136t7QG].
- **Endocrine hypertension**: Such as pheochromocytoma or primary aldosteronism [^111MANxy].
- **Coarctation of the aorta**: Less likely without femoral pulse discrepancy or radio-femoral delay [^1176rRQp].
- **Idiopathic intracranial hypertension**: Typically presents with headache and papilledema but not severe systemic hypertension [^notfound].

Given the clinical clues — severe hypertension, abdominal bruit, and neurologic symptoms — **renovascular hypertension** is the most likely diagnosis [^115LjBMM].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

According to the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guidelines, patients with severe hypertension and an abdominal bruit should undergo **vascular imaging** to evaluate for renovascular hypertension [^115LjBMM]. The recommended imaging modalities include:

- **Duplex renal ultrasound**: Non-invasive but operator-dependent and may be limited by body habitus or bowel gas [^notfound].
- **Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA)**: Non-invasive but may be limited by availability, cost, and contraindications such as pacemakers or severe claustrophobia [^notfound].
- **Computed tomography angiography (CTA)**: Rapid, widely available, and highly sensitive and specific for detecting renal artery stenosis [^notfound].

In the acute setting, **CTA is the preferred modality** because it provides rapid and accurate assessment of the renal arteries, allowing for timely diagnosis and intervention [^notfound].

---

## Analysis of answer choices

| **Answer choice** | **Relevance to diagnosis** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| A. Echocardiography | Not diagnostic for renovascular hypertension | Echocardiography assesses cardiac structure and function but does not visualize renal arteries or detect stenosis [^notfound]. |
| B. Oral sodium loading test | Not indicated for renovascular hypertension | This test is used to confirm primary aldosteronism, an endocrine cause of hypertension, not renovascular disease [^111MANxy]. |
| C. CT angiography | Highly relevant and diagnostic | CTA is the gold standard for detecting renal artery stenosis and is recommended by guidelines for suspected renovascular hypertension [^notfound]. |
| D. High-dose dexamethasone suppression test | Not indicated for renovascular hypertension | This test is used to diagnose Cushing's syndrome, another endocrine cause of hypertension, not renovascular disease [^notfound]. |

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

The most likely diagnosis is **renovascular hypertension** due to renal artery stenosis, given the severe hypertension, abdominal bruit, and neurologic symptoms. The most appropriate confirmatory test is **CT angiography** [^1136t7QG], as it provides rapid, accurate visualization of the renal arteries and guides subsequent management. Echocardiography and endocrine tests are not indicated for this clinical scenario.

### Evaluation and treatment of severe asymptomatic hypertension [^1138gF2X]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Poorly controlled hypertension is a common finding in the outpatient setting. When patients present with severely elevated blood pressure (i.e., systolic blood pressure of 180 mm Hg or greater, or diastolic blood pressure of 110 mm Hg or greater), physicians need to differentiate hypertensive emergency from severely elevated blood pressure without signs or symptoms of end-organ damage (severe asymptomatic hypertension). Most patients who are asymptomatic but have poorly controlled hypertension do not have acute end-organ damage and, therefore, do not require immediate workup or treatment (within 24 hours). However, physicians should confirm blood pressure readings and appropriately classify the hypertensive state. A cardiovascular risk profile is important in guiding the treatment of severe asymptomatic hypertension; higher risk patients may benefit from more urgent and aggressive evaluation and treatment. Oral agents may be initiated before discharge, but intravenous medications and fast-acting oral agents should be reserved for true hypertensive emergencies. High blood pressure should be treated gradually. Appropriate, repeated follow-up over weeks to months is needed to reach desired blood pressure goals.

### Development of a clinical decision tool to reduce diagnostic testing for primary aldosteronism in patients with difficult-to-control hypertension [^111MANxy]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Primary aldosteronism (PA) is one of the most common causes of secondary hypertension. The estimated prevalence ranges from 3–6% in primary care to 5–11% in referred hypertensive patients and is even higher in patients with resistant hypertension (more than 11%). Diagnosing PA is important as targeted therapy may lower the increased risk for cardiovascular events and target organ damage in these patients.

As supported by the Endocrine Society Clinical Practice Guideline, diagnosis of PA is generally made by a sequence of blood tests: elevated aldosterone-to-renin ratio (ARR), followed by confirmation of autonomous aldosterone production by non-suppressible aldosterone levels. Many antihypertensive medications change renin and aldosterone levels, falsely increasing or decreasing the ARR, which leads to false positive or false negative test results. Therefore, aldosterone and renin levels are usually determined after cessation of antihypertensive medications that affect the ARR. However, medication washout raises safety concerns in patients with severe hypertension or individuals with a recent cardiovascular event in which tight blood pressure (BP) control is necessary. In addition, a substantial number of patients experience symptoms during the washout period: i.e. (worsening of) headache, fatigue or palpitations.

Since diagnostic testing is burdensome, potentially harmful and costly, it is necessary to select carefully which patients to further test for PA. The Endocrine Society Clinical Practice Guideline recommends to perform diagnostic testing in all patients with 'an increased risk of having PA', this includes patients with hypertension and either sustained BP above 150/100 mmHg, spontaneous or diuretic-induced hypokalemia, adrenal incidentaloma, obstructive sleep apnea or a family history of early onset hypertension or cerebrovascular accident, patients with resistant hypertension and first-degree relatives of patients with PA. The majority of hypertensive patients referred to hospitals fulfil at least one of these criteria, meaning that most referred patients should be tested for PA. With a prevalence of 4–10% this strategy results in many negative test results and thus to unnecessary testing and costs. This may be one of the reasons that the Clinical Practice Guideline is poorly adopted and that many patients with hypertension are left unscreened for PA. Therefore, we aimed to develop and validate a clinical decision tool to determine which patients with difficult-to-control hypertension have a low probability of PA and do not need to undergo intensive testing. Thereby we aim to limit exposure to invasive testing while at the same time increasing the efficiency of testing in the remaining patients.

### Does this child with high blood pressure have secondary hypertension? the rational clinical examination systematic review [^111XUK9E]. JAMA (2023). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Guidelines recommend that all children and adolescents with hypertension undergo evaluation for secondary causes. Identifying clinical factors associated with secondary hypertension may decrease unnecessary testing for those with primary hypertension.

Objective

To determine the utility of the clinical history, physical examination, and 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring for differentiating primary hypertension from secondary hypertension in children and adolescents (aged ≤ 21 years).

Data Sources and Study Selection

The databases of MEDLINE, PubMed Central, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library were searched from inception to January 2022 without language limits. Two authors identified studies describing clinical characteristics in children and adolescents with primary and secondary hypertension.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

For each clinical finding in each study, a 2×2 table was created that included the number of patients with and without the finding who had primary vs secondary hypertension. Risk of bias was assessed using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies tool.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Random-effects modeling was used to calculate sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratios (LRs).

Results

Of 3254 unique titles and abstracts screened, 30 studies met inclusion criteria for the meta-analysis and 23 (N = 4210 children and adolescents) were used for pooling in the meta-analysis. In the 3 studies conducted at primary care clinics or school-based screening clinics, the prevalence of secondary hypertension was 9.0% (95% CI, 4.5%-15.0%). In the 20 studies conducted at subspecialty clinics, the prevalence of secondary hypertension was 44% (95% CI, 36%-53%). The demographic findings most strongly associated with secondary hypertension were family history of secondary hypertension (sensitivity, 0.46; specificity, 0.90; LR, 4.7 [95% CI, 2.9–7.6]), weight in the 10th percentile or lower for age and sex (sensitivity, 0.27; specificity, 0.94; LR, 4.5 [95% CI, 1.2–18]), history of prematurity (sensitivity range, 0.17–0.33; specificity range, 0.86–0.94; LR range, 2.3–2.8), and age of 6 years or younger (sensitivity range, 0.25–0.36; specificity range, 0.86–0.88; LR range, 2.2–2.6). Laboratory studies most associated with secondary hypertension were microalbuminuria (sensitivity, 0.13; specificity, 0.99; LR, 13 [95% CI, 3.1–53]) and serum uric acid concentration of 5.5 mg/dL or lower (sensitivity range, 0.70–0.73; specificity range, 0.65–0.89; LR range, 2.1–6.3). Increased daytime diastolic blood pressure load combined with increased nocturnal systolic blood pressure load on 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring was associated with secondary hypertension (sensitivity, 0.40; specificity, 0.82; LR, 4.8 [95% CI, 1.2–20]). Findings associated with a decreased likelihood of secondary hypertension were asymptomatic presentation (LR range, 0.19–0.36), obesity (LR, 0.34 [95% CI, 0.13–0.90]), and family history of any hypertension (LR, 0.42 [95% CI, 0.30–0.57]). Hypertension stage, headache, and left ventricular hypertrophy did not distinguish secondary from primary hypertension.

Conclusions and Relevance

Family history of secondary hypertension, younger age, lower body weight, and increased blood pressure load using 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring were associated with a higher likelihood of secondary hypertension. No individual sign or symptom definitively differentiates secondary hypertension from primary hypertension.

### Secondary arterial hypertension: when, who, and how to screen? [^116WixjN]. European Heart Journal (2014). Low credibility.

Secondary hypertension refers to arterial hypertension due to an identifiable cause and affects ∼5–10% of the general hypertensive population. Because secondary forms are rare and work up is time-consuming and expensive, only patients with clinical suspicion should be screened. In recent years, some new aspects gained importance regarding this screening. In particular, increasing evidence suggests that 24 h ambulatory blood pressure (BP) monitoring plays a central role in the work up of patients with suspected secondary hypertension. Moreover, obstructive sleep apnoea has been identified as one of the most frequent causes. Finally, the introduction of catheter-based renal denervation for the treatment of patients with resistant hypertension has dramatically increased the interest and the number of patients evaluated for renal artery stenosis. We review the clinical clues of the most common causes of secondary hypertension. Specific recommendations are given as to evaluation and treatment of various forms of secondary hypertension. Despite appropriate therapy or even removal of the secondary cause, BP rarely ever returns to normal with long-term follow-up. Such residue hypertension indicates either that some patients with secondary hypertension also have concomitant essential hypertension or that irreversible vascular remodelling has taken place. Thus, in patients with potentially reversible causes of hypertension, early detection and treatment are important to minimize/prevent irreversible changes in the vasculature and target organs.

### Diagnostics, monitoring and outpatient care in children with suspected pulmonary hypertension / paediatric pulmonary hypertensive vascular disease. expert consensus statement on the diagnosis and treatment of paediatric pulmonary hypertension. the European paediatric pulmonary vascular disease network, endorsed by ISHLT and DGPK [^1146Y3TH]. Heart (2016). Medium credibility.

Diagnostic algorithm — children with suspected or confirmed PH should be referred to, comprehensively evaluated and treated in multidisciplinary, specialist paediatric PH centres, and the full assessment of invasive haemodynamics (right and left heart catheterisation), including ventricular performance and advanced non-invasive imaging, should be performed prior to the initiation of therapy by means of echocardiography, cardiac catheterisation and cardiac MRI. In the process of the initial evaluation of 'pulmonary hypertension' and work-up, both a comprehensive medical history and physical examination are mandatory, and particular attention should be paid to accompanying symptoms and problems that could potentially suggest an underlying cause or modifier of PH. A full clinical assessment of functional class (FC) of the child or adolescent (table 6) and further investigations, such as ECG, chest X-ray (CXR), echocardiography and functional testing (if feasible in that age), that is, lung function test, 6 min walk (6MWT) and cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET), should also be performed at the initial evaluation for PH. However, the clinical status of the patient at the time of presentation has to be taken into account and stabilisation of the patient is paramount, even if this includes initiation of advanced PH-specific therapies before exact diagnosis.

### What is the evidence base for diagnosing hypertension and for subsequent blood pressure treatment targets in the prevention of cardiovascular disease? [^111YWZDT]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

When should patients have their BP measured?

In addition to the method of screening for hypertension, the frequency of such screening is also important, but the evidence to underpin this is scarce. Piper et al. tried to confirm "the shortest interval in which clinically significant, diagnosed hypertension may develop" in their recent systematic review. They found 43 studies had examined screening intervals and established the incidence of hypertension found in 1- to 5-year intervals. It was impossible to reach any firm conclusions due to heterogeneity in the study results, with mean incidence ranging from 2% to 28% over a 5-year period. It may be more helpful to consider when to rescreen on the basis of current BP. Five studies reported on the incidence of hypertension over a 5-year period for three categories of BP: optimum, < 120/80 mmHg; normal, 120–129/80–84 mmHg; and high-normal, 130–139/85–89 mmHg. Meta-analysis showed increased incidence of hypertension with increasing baseline blood pressure, a six-fold increase between high-normal and optimum, and a very low rate in the latter case – of less than 10% in a 5-year period. The authors suggest that this highlights the need to identify subpopulations which may benefit from a more structured screening programme, including older people, overweight or obese patients, those with a high-normal BP and certain ethnic minority groups.

Whilst primary care remains the commonest setting for hypertension screening, there is growing evidence to suggest that community screening may help to reach greater numbers of patients. A comprehensive systematic review by Fleming et al. showed that screening has been undertaken in a range of locations, with pharmacies and mobile units the most successful settings assessed, albeit with a high level of heterogeneity. However, only 16% of studies reported a referral to primary care following screening, of which a new hypertension diagnosis was made in a median of 44%, suggesting that a joined-up approach is fundamental to the impact of such screening.

Novel primary care settings may also prove successful, such as optometry. In the USA, screening for medical conditions in dentistry has been assessed as potentially acceptable to both patients and physicians. More studies in this area are needed to establish how physician and non-physician screening could complement each other.

### Hypertension management in emergency departments [^111q6zeP]. American Journal of Hypertension (2020). Medium credibility.

While specific symptoms such as acute dyspnea associated with hypertensive heart failure or chest pain concerning for an acute aortic syndrome may prompt immediate treatment before a full diagnostic evaluation, symptoms alone do not define hypertensive emergencies, and ongoing IV antihypertensive treatment should depend on additional diagnostic tests that confirm acute organ injury. For the large majority of ED patients, presenting clinical features are too nonspecific to prompt immediate IV antihypertensive therapy without confirmatory testing. Table 1 describes common symptoms that emergency medicine clinicians encounter when considering new or worsening end-organ injury in the setting of markedly elevated BP. For time-sensitive conditions such as acute ischemic stroke, rapid BP lowering may be indicated when BP exceeds 185/110 mm Hg and thrombolytic or endovascular treatment is planned. Most acute ischemic stroke patients, however, are not candidates for thrombolytic or endovascular therapy, and BP lowering should be avoided. The ischemic penumbra lacks autoregulation of cerebral blood flow and is dependent on systemic perfusion pressure such that acute lowering may worsen ischemia.

Table 1.
Historical and physical findings associated with hypertensive emergencies

Specific tests are indicated for all patients with suspected hypertensive emergency including a basic metabolic profile, complete blood count, urinalysis, electrocardiogram, and chest x-ray. Further workup of patients with markedly elevated BP should be symptom-based and aligned with each associated condition's differential diagnosis. Figure 1 demonstrates a general approach to patients with markedly elevated BP. In a patient with altered mental status and BP > 220/120 mm Hg, the evaluation includes brain imaging by computed tomography to assess for intracerebral hemorrhage or hypertensive encephalopathy. If neither hemorrhage on computed tomography nor alternative reasons for altered mental status are present, magnetic resonance imaging may be warranted. Likewise, biomarkers of cardiac injury (troponin) and stress (natriuretic peptides) should be obtained for patients with concurrent shortness of breath or chest pain, with the addition of computed tomography angiography of the thorax and abdomen when an acute aortic syndrome is suspected.

### 2019 updated consensus statement on the diagnosis and treatment of pediatric pulmonary hypertension: the European pediatric pulmonary vascular disease network (EPPVDN), endorsed by AEPC, ESPR and ISHLT [^1148TYFG]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2019). High credibility.

Pediatric pulmonary hypertension — genetic testing and counseling: Genetic counseling is recommended for families with children diagnosed with idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (IPAH) or heritable pulmonary arterial hypertension (HPAH), and if indicated should be performed by a qualified individual with training in genetics and should precede genetic testing, with information on disease, treatment options, prognosis, and psychosocial issues addressed. Families of patients with syndromes associated with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) should be educated on PAH symptoms, and it is recommended to seek clinical evaluation if the child should develop symptoms of PAH. Genetic testing for PAH-associated genes such as ACVRL1, ABCB8, BMPR2, CAV1, ENG, TBX4, KCNK3, and EIF2AK4 can be useful in children with PAH of unknown cause for defining etiology, estimating prognosis, and identifying family members at risk; testing for NOTCH3, SMAD9, GDF2, AQP1, SMAD8, SOX17, and ATP13A3 may be useful although further evidence is needed to confirm pathogenicity. Children who are asymptomatic PAH mutation carriers should be screened with echocardiograms every 1–3 years for elevated right ventricular (RV) pressure and undergo additional diagnostic evaluation if clinically indicated. Genetic testing of first-degree relatives of an index patient with PAH and a known disease-causing mutation is indicated for risk stratification and rationalizing surveillance, and asymptomatic first-degree relatives of patients with HPAH without an identified PAH-associated gene mutation should be screened with serial echocardiograms for elevated RV pressure and undergo additional diagnostic evaluation if clinically indicated.

### Secondary hypertension and complications: diagnosis and role of imaging [^1176rRQp]. Radiographics (2019). Medium credibility.

Hypertension is a common problem; if left untreated, it can result in significant complications, including those involving the cardiovascular system and end organs. Approximately 10% of patients with hypertension are classified as having secondary hypertension, defined as hypertension attributable to a specific and potentially remediable cause. The evaluation for secondary hypertension typically begins with acquiring the patient history and performing a physical examination and screening laboratory tests. Directed imaging may be performed, on the basis of laboratory test results, to assess for potential causes of secondary hypertension. The causes can be broadly classified as endocrine (eg, hyperaldosteronism, pheochromocytoma, hyperparathyroidism) and nonendocrine (eg, aortic coarctation, renal vascular hypertension). In addition, patients with hypertension can develop significant complications that also are diagnosed with imaging, including conditions involving the cardiovascular system (eg, aortic aneurysm, acute aortic syndrome) and central nervous system (eg, stroke, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome). The imaging workup and imaging appearances of some of the causes of secondary hypertension are reviewed, treatment options are discussed, and the imaging appearances of hypertension-related complications are described. It is important for radiologists to accurately diagnose the secondary causes of hypertension, as many of them are treatable, and treatment may result in improved symptoms or resolution of hypertension. © RSNA, 2019.

### Diagnosis and assessment of pulmonary arterial hypertension [^11719cJS]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2009). Low credibility.

The diagnosis and assessment of pulmonary arterial hypertension is a rapidly evolving area, with changes occurring in the definition of the disease, screening and diagnostic techniques, and staging and follow-up assessment. The definition of pulmonary hypertension has been simplified, and is now based on currently available evidence. There has been substantial progress in advancing the imaging techniques and biomarkers used to screen patients for the disease and to follow up their response to therapy. The importance of accurate assessment of right ventricular function in following up the clinical course and response to therapy is more fully appreciated. As new therapies are developed for pulmonary arterial hypertension, screening, prompt diagnosis, and accurate assessment of disease severity become increasingly important. A clear definition of pulmonary hypertension and the development of a rational approach to diagnostic assessment and follow-up using both conventional and new tools will be essential to deriving maximal benefit from our expanding therapeutic armamentarium.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Secondary hypertension — Prevalence, screening triggers, and renovascular disease frequency: Secondary causes of hypertension can be identified in approximately 5% to 25% of adult patients with hypertension, and patients with a new diagnosis of hypertension and concomitant conditions should be screened with a history and physical examination and laboratory tests. Indicators raising suspicion include stage 2 hypertension, treatment-resistant hypertension, sudden onset of hypertension, increased BP in patients previously controlled on drug therapy, early-onset hypertension (age < 30 years), diastolic hypertension in older adults, and target organ damage disproportionate to the duration or severity. Common forms include primary aldosteronism and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and atherosclerotic renovascular disease may be present in 14% to 40% of adults with hypertension, although only a small fraction (0.1% to 5%) is hemodynamically significant.

Pulmonary arterial hypertension associated with connective tissue disease — epidemiology and diagnostic screening — shows a strong female predominance and later presentation, with "female/male ratio 4:1", and mean age at diagnosis "commonly > 50 years, especially in SSc"; in systemic sclerosis (SSc), "The prevalence of pre-capillary PH in large cohorts of patients with SSc is 5–19%". For evaluation, "Chest CT is recommended for evaluating the presence of associated ILD or PVOD/PH", and "An isolated reduction of DLCO is common in PAH-CTD". For screening, "Resting echocardiography combined with other tests is recommended as a screening test in asymptomatic patients with SSc, followed by annual assessments", whereas "In other CTDs, PH screening in the absence of suggestive symptoms is not recommended, while echocardiography should be performed in the presence of symptoms". For confirmation, "As in other forms of PAH, RHC is recommended in all cases of suspected PAH-CTD to confirm diagnosis, determine severity, and rule out LHD". Mortality risk differs, with "The unadjusted risk of death for PAH-SSc compared with IPAH is 2.9".

### Tests for predicting complications of pre-eclampsia: a protocol for systematic reviews [^114nBRPs]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Hypertension is a common medical complication of pregnancy, affecting about 6–8% of all pregnancies. Hypertensive disorders in pregnancy consist of a group of disorders that include pre-eclampsia, latent or chronic essential hypertension, a variety of renal diseases, and transient (gestational) hypertension. The definitions used to distinguish these disorders differ, leading to uncertainty about their prevalence, natural history and response to treatment. Pre eclampsia is associated with several complications and remains one of the largest single cause of maternal and fetal mortality and morbidity. They have been reported to account for 14% of direct maternal deaths and 18% of fetal or infant deaths.

Once the diagnosis of pre-eclampsia is established, timely management is of the essence to avoid or minimise mortality and morbidity. Clinical prediction of disease complications using a combination of patients' characteristics, symptoms, physical signs and investigations all of which we consider tests, forms the basis of clinical care in these situations. Therefore, there is a need for guidance regarding the best testing strategies with which to predict the development of complications in pre-eclampsia. As well as allowing clinicians to avoid unnecessary interventions in low risk groups, this would allow high-risk groups to benefit from monitoring of disease severity, use of antihypertensive therapy, administration of anticonvulsants, and antenatal corticosteroids.

Methods

The authors declare that all supporting data are available within the article.

Data Sources and Searches

This study was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42021258919). We searched Medline, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (inception to June 1, 2021; seefor detailed search strategy and methods).

Study Selection

Original studies evaluating any guideline-recommended confirmatory test for PA were eligible if they included comparison to a reference standard. Two reviewers independently screened titles and abstracts for eligibility and selected articles for further review if the study reported original data on confirmatory testing for PA. Full-text articles were reviewed in duplicate. Studies were selected for final inclusion if a 2×2 diagnostic accuracy table could be extracted (or reconstructed). Discrepancies were resolved by consensus.

Data Extraction and Quality Assessment

We collected information related to testing conditions, reference standards, and study design (eg, single-gate design where the entire sample was drawn from a single clinical population suspected to have PA versus 2- or multi-gate designs where cases and controls were sampled from 2 or more distinct source populations, such that cases were known or strongly suspected to have PA, but controls had an alternative diagnosis, like essential hypertension, or were healthy participants never at risk of having PA). The Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 tool was used to evaluate the risk of bias and concerns of applicability. Data extraction and assessment of study quality were performed in duplicate.

Statistical Analysis

We used coupled forest plots and the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) space to visualize variation between studies. Meta-analyses were conducted using hierarchical summary ROC models. We explored for sources of heterogeneity using meta-regression, considering differences in methodological quality and clinical characteristics between studies. To quantify differences, we calculated the relative diagnostic odds ratio, which is a summary measure of the relative accuracy. Because summary statistics are only interpretable when studies share a similar threshold (but thresholds varied considerably in our current review), we estimated the sensitivities at discrete points on the summary ROC curve corresponding to the lower quartile, median, and upper quartile of the reported specificities to facilitate comparisons. We calculated the number of missed cases and over-diagnosed cases per 1000 patients and presented these in a summary of findings table. Please seefor details.

Hypertension affects approximately one-third of Americans. An additional 30% are unaware that they harbor the disease. Significantly increased blood pressure constitutes a hypertensive emergency that could lead to end-organ damage. When organs such as the brain, heart, or kidney are affected, an intervention that will lower the blood pressure in several hours is indicated. Several pharmacologic options are available for treatment, with intravenous antihypertensive therapy being the cornerstone, but there is no standard of care. Careful consideration of each patient's specific complaint, history, and physical examination guides the emergency physician through the treatment algorithm.

### Investigating secondary hypertension in cerebrovascular disease [^115xheHY]. Practical Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Hypertension is the leading cause of stroke in the UK and worldwide. In recent years, stroke incidence has increased by 30%-41.5% in people aged under 64 years, with the prevalence of hypertension increasing by 4%-11%. Given that 5%-10% of people with hypertension in the general population have an underlying cause for their elevated blood pressure, it is important that all clinicians should maintain a high clinical suspicion for secondary hypertension. This review provides a clinical perspective of when to consider the underlying causes of secondary hypertension, with investigation algorithms for patients presenting with stroke and hypertension. Early involvement of hypertension specialist services is important to identify secondary causes of hypertension, as its effective control reduces cardiovascular-associated morbidity.

### Implementation of a clinical pathway for the evaluation of asymptomatic hypertension in the emergency department [^114X4Hxb]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

According to the guidelines of the American Heart Association and American College of Emergency Physicians, respectively, there is no indication for immediate lowering of asymptomatic hypertension in the Emergency Department (ED), and no requirement for routine diagnostic testing in these patients. Despite this, asymptomatic hypertension represents a recurring source of referrals for ED evaluation from other healthcare settings, or from patient self-referral, with significant practice variation in the evaluation and treatment of this complaint.

Methods

This is a pre-post study of a pathway to standardize care of patients presenting to a tertiary academic Veteran's Health Administration ED with asymptomatic hypertension. Inclusion criteria were patients with ICD10 codes of hypertension who were confirmed via chart review to have sought care for a complaint of elevated blood pressure readings from 2018 to 2022, with the pathway having been implementing in 2022. Patients were excluded if they had symptoms of possible end organ pathology due to hypertension, such as chest pain, headache, or shortness of breath, or if they were reproductive age women who had not undergone a sterilization procedure. The primary outcome was major adverse cardiovascular event within 30 days of ED visit. Secondary outcomes included: diagnostic tests performed, administration of antihypertensives in the ED, and length of stay. Descriptive statistics and statistical analysis were performed.

Results

There were a total of 295 unique patients and 324 patient encounters that met the inclusion/exclusion criteria, with 46 encounters that took place after pathway implementation. There were no major adverse cardiovascular events either before or after pathway implementation. Chest radiographs were reduced from 10% to 0% (p = 0.005) after pathway respectively. There were also declines in laboratory testing, EKGs, and administration of oral antihypertensives, but these differences were not statistically significant. At no point did any diagnostic testing identify any previously undiagnosed medical conditions. There were no instances of intravenous hypertensives being given after pathway implementation. Despite the reductions in diagnostic testing, there was no change in ED length of stay for patients with asymptomatic hypertension.

Conclusion

Our findings redemonstrate that patients presenting to the ED with asymptomatic hypertension are at low risk for short-term complications of hypertension, and that diagnostic testing is low yield in this population. While we were able to achieve reductions in unnecessary testing, further work is needed to educate clinicians and improve adherence to evidence based principles when caring for these patients.

Exclude other causes of OH/nOH

If blood pressure and heart rate changes indicate OH/nOH, a complete history and physical examination, as well as electrocardiogram and laboratory testing, should be focused on ruling out non-neurogenic causes of OH, including cardiogenic, vascular, or iatrogenic etiologies. Table 2 lists recommended tests to conduct when evaluating a patient for OH/nOH. Cardiac disorders (e.g. pacemakers, dysrhythmias, ablation, etc.) can preclude heart rate augmentation; therefore, a cardiac history, an electrocardiogram, and medication review (as noted above) should consistently be performed. Due to variability among patients, including age, disease status, and current medication usage, the lack of heart rate increase on standing may not always be an accurate indicator of nOH in patients with OH; therefore, clinical scenario and specific presentation need to be considered.

Primary aldosteronism (PA) is the main cause of endocrine hypertension, present in approximately 10% of hypertensive patients; about one-third is secondary to aldosterone-producing adenomas. Cardiovascular and renal morbidity are out of proportion to the degree of hypertension. Physicians have compelling rationale to correctly identify and treat PA. Physicians are challenged with patient selection for screening with the aldosterone/renin ratio (ARR), interpretation of ARR, and selecting a confirmatory test. Adrenal vein sampling is performed for subtype differentiation. The treatment depends on the disease subtype and results in control of hypertension and reversal of associated excess morbidity.

### What's new in paediatric hypertension? [^111trMb5]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2018). Low credibility.

Paediatric hypertension predisposes to hypertension and cardiovascular disease in adult life. Despite clear guidelines, there remains a lack of screening. Diagnosis remains challenging given the high rate of false-positive high blood pressure (BP) readings at a single visit; thus, multiple visits are required to confirm the diagnosis. Depending on the normative data sets used, hypertension in overweight and obese children can be underestimated by up to 20%. Specific BP targets are required for subgroups such as adolescents, children with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and type 1 diabetes. High dietary salt intake is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Given the rise in processed food consumption, children in developed nations are likely to benefit from salt restriction at a population-based level.

### Development of a clinical decision tool to reduce diagnostic testing for primary aldosteronism in patients with difficult-to-control hypertension [^114ZU15V]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2020). Medium credibility.

The population of patients with difficult-to-control hypertension in the present study represents the group of hypertensive patients generally referred by general practitioners, which is reflected by the prevalence of PA: 4.9% in this study compared to 4.6–11.2% in other cohorts of referred hypertensive patients. More importantly, the majority of the patients in this study fulfil the Endocrine Society Clinical Practice Guidelines of increased risk for PA. Therefore, the decision tool in the present study adds diagnostic value on top of the diagnostic algorithm presented in the Guideline. The proportion of male PA patients in this study is relatively high, given the small number of PA cases in the present study, the observed difference may also be due to chance.

The clinical value of the decision tool lies in excluding PA, precluding low-risk patients from intensive diagnostic testing, rather than confirming PA. The extent to which it reduces the proportion of patients to be tested varies with the cut-off value chosen and depends on the clinical setting in which the decision tool will be applied. In community hospitals, where the prevalence of PA is relatively low, a high cut-off value (for example 2.5%) may be chosen, sparing intensive diagnostic testing in a considerable proportion of patients, while the absolute number of missed cases remains low. In a tertiary center, where the prevalence of PA is relatively high, a lower cut-off value (for example 1.5%) may be chosen, limiting the chance of a missed case but still reducing the diagnostic burden. By reducing the proportion of hypertensive patients to be intensively tested and increasing the probability of catching a PA case among those tested, our decision tool may motivate physicians to perform diagnostic workup for PA in patients with difficult-to-control hypertension, thereby reducing underdiagnoses.

Assigning Diagnoses in the Gray Zones Between Type 1 MI, Type 2 MI, and Acute Nonischemic Myocardial Injury

We believe that, in the absence of a clear alternative cause, the initial working diagnosis for most patients with evidence of acute myocardial injury and signs and symptoms consistent with ischemia (eg, typical chest pain) should be type 1 MI, and should prompt management according to established guidelines for type 1 MI (Figures 4 and 5). When subsequent evaluation fails to confirm coronary atherothrombosis, further consideration of alternative causes of acute nonischemic myocardial injury (eg, myocarditis, pulmonary embolism) or type 2 MI (eg, supply/demand mismatch, spasm, coronary dissection) is necessary. It is important to note that many patients with type 1 MI will have tachycardia, hypertension, and even anemia, and clinicians must be cautious not to overdiagnose type 2 MI in patients with modest supply/demand mismatch; such overdiagnosis can lead to the delay or withholding of appropriate treatments for type 1 MI. However, when type 1 MI is not the most likely cause of myocardial injury, caution must be applied in using diagnostic and treatment strategies with potential for iatrogenic harm. Diagnostic and treatment strategies should be based on a careful assessment of ischemic signs and symptoms, the presence or absence of diagnoses likely to cause ischemic versus nonischemic myocardial injury, the pretest probability of type 1 MI, the risk of diagnostic testing modalities (eg, contrast nephropathy), risk of treatment modalities (eg, bleeding), and expected outcomes with or without treatment (Figures 4 and 5).

### Screening for hypertension in adults: updated evidence report and systematic review for the US preventive services task force [^115cxT4U]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Hypertension is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease and can be modified through lifestyle and pharmacological interventions to reduce cardiovascular events and mortality.

Objective

To systematically review the benefits and harms of screening and confirmatory blood pressure measurements in adults, to inform the US Preventive Services Task Force.

Data Sources

MEDLINE, PubMed, Cochrane Collaboration Central Registry of Controlled Trials, and CINAHL; surveillance through March 26, 2021.

Study Selection

Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and nonrandomized controlled intervention studies for effectiveness of screening; accuracy studies for screening and confirmatory measurements (ambulatory blood pressure monitoring as the reference standard); RCTs and nonrandomized controlled intervention studies and observational studies for harms of screening and confirmation.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Independent critical appraisal and data abstraction; meta-analyses and qualitative syntheses.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Mortality; cardiovascular events; quality of life; sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values; harms of screening.

Results

A total of 52 studies (N = 215 534) were identified in this systematic review. One cluster RCT (n = 140 642) of a multicomponent intervention including hypertension screening reported fewer annual cardiovascular-related hospital admissions for cardiovascular disease in the intervention group compared with the control group (difference, 3.02 per 1000 people; rate ratio, 0.91 [95% CI, 0.86–0.97]). Meta-analysis of 15 studies (n = 11 309) of initial office-based blood pressure screening showed a pooled sensitivity of 0.54 (95% CI, 0.37–0.70) and specificity of 0.90 (95% CI, 0.84–0.95), with considerable clinical and statistical heterogeneity. Eighteen studies (n = 57 128) of various confirmatory blood pressure measurement modalities were heterogeneous. Meta-analysis of 8 office-based confirmation studies (n = 53 183) showed a pooled sensitivity of 0.80 (95% CI, 0.68–0.88) and specificity of 0.55 (95% CI, 0.42–0.66). Meta-analysis of 4 home-based confirmation studies (n = 1001) showed a pooled sensitivity of 0.84 (95% CI, 0.76–0.90) and a specificity of 0.60 (95% CI, 0.48–0.71). Thirteen studies (n = 5150) suggested that screening was associated with no decrement in quality of life or psychological distress; evidence on absenteeism was mixed. Ambulatory blood pressure measurement was associated with temporary sleep disturbance and bruising.

Conclusions and Relevance

Screening using office-based blood pressure measurement had major accuracy limitations, including misdiagnosis; however, direct harms of measurement were minimal. Research is needed to determine optimal screening and confirmatory algorithms for clinical practice.

### Consistency of recommendations for evaluation and management of hypertension [^11222Xir]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

The recommendation from the American College of Cardiology, American Heart Association, and accompanying organizationsto lower the blood pressure threshold for the diagnosis of hypertension in their clinical practice guideline (CPG) has been controversial, especially because adhering to such guidance would result in classifying nearly half the US population as unwell and subjecting them to treatment. Moreover, the diagnostic classifications and blood pressure thresholds deemed to be normal vary across CPGs.,

When independent groups have reviewed the same evidence, considered various key factors, such as values and preferences, and come to the same conclusions regarding a recommendation, the credibility of the recommendation is increased. This is comparable to research results in which the replication of findings by repeated experiments increases their credibility. However, when groups reach inconsistent conclusions about a recommendation, the inconsistency can create confusion. If combined with lack of clarity, inaccuracy, or poor alignment with the context of clinical practice, inconsistent recommendations have the potential for undesirable consequences, such as wasting resources and contributing to worse clinical outcomes.

Hypertension is the most common specific primary diagnosis for ambulatory care visits among adults in the United States, and more than 65 currently active CPGs are available worldwide for the diagnosis and treatment of hypertension. We sought to determine the consistency of recommendations for evaluation and management of hypertension across prominent CPGs. In the absence of an existing method for such an evaluation, we developed a method to complete our study.

Research about CPGs is often conducted by CPG developers and methodologists, and interpretation may lack public and patient perspectives. We initially sought to involve patient and public representatives in our study, and their interests led to additional assessments of the CPGs for evidence of public and patient involvement, patient-facing information, and shared decision-making tools.

Portopulmonary hypertension (PPH) — presentation, screening, diagnostic confirmation, and severity thresholds: Portopulmonary hypertension (PPH) is a rare, insidious, and significant complication of portosystemic shunting of any cause, and presenting symptoms include dyspnea, cough, or syncope, but these cardiopulmonary symptoms may be absent. Cardiomegaly may or may not be present on the chest x-ray and an electrocardiogram (EKG) may reveal right ventricular hypertrophy, but is most often normal. A transthoracic echocardiogram (ECHO) with evidence of right ventricular wall thickening, tricuspid valve regurgitation, and a calculated pulmonary artery systolic pressure ≥ 40 mmHg is the best noninvasive screening tool, and cardiac catheterization to exclude other causes of pulmonary hypertension and measure the mean pulmonary artery pressure (MPAP) is required to establish the diagnosis of PPH. In adults, PPH is considered mild, moderate, or severe if the MPAP is ≥ 25 to ≤ 35, > 35 to ≤ 45, and > 45 mmHg, respectively, and the presence of severe PPH with MPAP of > 50 mmHg has a high risk of mortality; experience with PPH in children is limited to case reports and single-site experiences.

### Confirmatory testing for primary aldosteronism: a study of diagnostic test accuracy [^1146dnT1]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Confirmatory testing to verify the diagnosis of primary aldosteronism (PA) in patients who have an abnormal screening result is of uncertain benefit.

Objective

To perform a blinded assessment of the seated saline suppression test (SSST).

Design

Diagnostic test accuracy study. (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04422756).

Setting

The regional Endocrine Hypertension Clinic in Calgary, Alberta, Canada.

Participants

156 adults with a positive screening result for PA.

Intervention

The SSST was done by administering 2 L of 0.9% sodium chloride intravenously over 4 hours with the patient seated.

Measurements

Treatment response was considered the reference standard for determining disease status and was based on blood pressure lowering, reduction of antihypertensive drug dose, and normalization of biochemistry. Measures of diagnostic test accuracy, including sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value, were estimated.

Results

Post-SSST aldosterone concentrations measured using immunoassay overlapped between treatment responders (median, 329 pmol/L [IQR, 227 to 525 pmol/L]) and nonresponders (median, 255 pmol/L [IQR, 162 to 346 pmol/L]). The SSST could not discriminate between response statuses (area under the curve, 62.1% [95% CI, 45.1% to 79.1%]). The positive and negative likelihood ratios were equivocal for aldosterone cutoffs ranging from 140 to 300 pmol/L. These findings remained consistent after differences in treatment, occurrence of hypokalemia, and laboratory assay used were accounted for.

Limitation

The study population had many patients with high-risk features of PA and few nonresponders.

Conclusion

The SSST is associated with a high false-negative rate, and reliance on it may lead to missed opportunities for intervention.

### Hypertensive emergencies: diagnosis and management [^111KBgwn]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

The treatment of hypertension is preventive medicine. This principle applies in the emergency room as well as the clinic. However, there are crucial contrasts between these two care settings related to specific goals of management for real emergencies and nonemergency conditions. In the emergency room, rapid triage is necessary to separate those who can safely be sent home for future clinic assessment from those who require immediate interventions including short stays in 24-hour observation units or hospitalization for more serious problems. This review focuses on decisions related to hypertension management in the emergency room and over brief periods of observation and treatment. Strategy is supported by evidence-based considerations whenever possible. Where outcome studies are not available, we rely on the rationale derived from relevant clinical research.

### Prevalence of secondary hypertension in otherwise healthy youths with a new diagnosis of Hypertension: a meta-analysis [^117DvA6A]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

To estimate the prevalence of secondary hypertension among otherwise healthy children with hypertension diagnosed in the outpatient setting.

Study Design

The MEDLINE, PubMed Central, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library databases were systematically searched for observational studies reporting the prevalence of secondary hypertension in children who underwent evaluation for hypertension and had no known comorbidities associated with hypertension at the time of diagnosis. Two authors independently extracted the study-specific prevalence of secondary hypertension in children evaluated for hypertension. Prevalence estimates for secondary hypertension were pooled in a random-effects meta-analysis.

Results

Nineteen prospective studies and 7 retrospective studies including 2575 children with hypertension were analyzed, with a median of 65 participants (range, 9–486) in each study. Studies conducted in primary care or school settings reported a lower prevalence of secondary hypertension (3.7%; 95% CI, 1.2%-7.2%) compared with studies conducted in referral clinics (20.1%; 95% CI, 11.5%-30.3%). When stratified by study setting, there were no significant subgroup differences according to study design, country, participant age range, hypertension definition, blood pressure device, or study quality. Although the studies applied different approaches to diagnosing secondary hypertension, diagnostic evaluations were at least as involved as the limited testing recommended by current guidelines.

Conclusions

The low prevalence of secondary hypertension among children with a new diagnosis of hypertension identified on screening reinforces clinical practice guidelines to avoid extensive testing in the primary care setting for secondary causes in most children with hypertension.

### Screening for hypertensive disorders of pregnancy: US preventive services task force final recommendation statement [^114w4L9Q]. JAMA (2023). Excellent credibility.

USPSTF hypertensive disorders of pregnancy — screening tests and thresholds: Blood pressure measurements are routinely used as a screening tool for hypertensive disorders throughout pregnancy and the postpartum period, and accurate blood pressure measurement requires an appropriate technique, a device validated for use in pregnancy, and a cuff of an appropriate size for the patient. A positive screening result for new-onset hypertension during pregnancy is defined as an elevated blood pressure reading (systolic blood pressure ≥ 140 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure ≥ 90 mm Hg) in the absence of chronic hypertension or kidney disease measured at least 4 hours apart. Screening evaluations include testing for proteinuria when preeclampsia is suspected; however, the USPSTF found that point-of-care tests for protein in the urine had low accuracy, and evidence does not support routine point-of-care urine tests to screen for preeclampsia because proteinuria alone may not be a good predictor of preeclampsia health outcomes. Protein measurement is not used in the diagnostic criteria for preeclampsia.

### Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome: a narrative review for emergency clinicians [^1172eSPE]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) is a clinicoradiologic disorder characterized by seizures, headache, altered mental status, and visual disturbances, and is often associated with acute hypertension.

Objective

This narrative review provides a focused description of the presentation, diagnostic evaluation, and management of PRES.

Discussion

PRES is associated with a variety of factors, including acute rise in blood pressure, renal disease, preeclampsia/eclampsia, and immunosuppressive therapy. The pathophysiology is theorized to involve dysfunction of cerebral autoregulation leading to vascular leak or endothelial dysfunction resulting in vasogenic edema. In the emergency department (ED), clinical findings suggestive of PRES should prompt diagnostic testing focused on confirming the diagnosis and excluding other conditions that may present similarly. Laboratory studies are primarily useful for excluding alternative diagnoses. Computed tomography (CT) and, in particular, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are the recommended neuroimaging modalities for diagnosis. CT and MRI may demonstrate cerebral vasogenic edema, most often in the distribution of the posterior circulation. Treatment involves management of seizures, control of blood pressure if elevated, and treatment of any underlying trigger.

Conclusion

PRES is a neurological disorder that is typically reversible if recognized on presentation and promptly and appropriately managed. This narrative review characterizes this condition for emergency clinicians.

### Development of a clinical decision tool to reduce diagnostic testing for primary aldosteronism in patients with difficult-to-control hypertension [^114ETfrA]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The main finding of this cross-sectional, diagnostic study is that a decision tool with seven easy-to-measure clinical variables can reliably select patients with difficult-to-control hypertension with a low probability of PA, sparing 8 to 32% of patients intensive diagnostic testing.

This is an important finding since satisfactory tools to preclude low-risk patients from diagnostic testing are lacking. There is a need for diagnostic tools that reduce the number of patients to be intensively tested for PA to a greater extent than the algorithm provided by the Endocrine Society does. Moreover, results from a French study deriving a diagnostic model to estimate the probability of PA in patients referred for PA screening, cannot be generalized to all patients referred with difficult-to-control hypertension. The investigators included a study population with a substantial higher prevalence of PA (elevated ARR was 45% compared to 17% in our study) and a relatively large proportion of patients on potassium supplementation. Moreover, they predicted the presence of elevated ARR instead of PA itself.

### Differentiating asthma and tracheal stenosis: why confirmation of the diagnosis of asthma should precede treatment [^114uZe4N]. The Journal of Asthma (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Asthma is a common respiratory condition; however, its symptoms often overlap with other diseases, posing diagnostic challenges. Tracheal stenosis, often seen in patients with a history of intubation, can mimic asthma symptoms, leading to misdiagnosis.

Case Study

This case study discusses a 58-year-old female with hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and obesity. She was initially treated for presumed asthma for over a year without confirming the diagnosis with pulmonary function tests (PFTs). Despite multiple steroid treatments for exacerbations, her condition deteriorated, leading to hospitalization. During hospitalization, her symptoms were minimally improved with steroid and nebulizer treatments. Examination revealed inspiratory stridor, and a subsequent CT scan identified subglottic tracheal stenosis. Flexible bronchoscopy confirmed the stenosis, successfully treated with balloon dilation. Post-procedure, her PFTs showed mild obstruction without bronchodilator response, her shortness of breath resolved, and her exercise tolerance improved markedly without ongoing asthma treatment.

Discussion

Asthma symptoms, including dyspnea, wheezing, cough, and chest tightness, frequently overlap with tracheal stenosis. Early differentiation is crucial to avoid misdiagnosis, reduce unnecessary treatments, and prevent complications. Recognizing risk factors, such as obesity, diabetes, female gender, and prior intubation, and employing diagnostic tools, such as PFTs and CT scan of the neck help diagnose tracheal stenosis. Prompt bronchoscopy and appropriate intervention can dramatically improve patient outcomes.

Conclusion

This case underscores the importance of heightened clinical suspicion and comprehensive diagnostic evaluation in patients with persistent treatment-resistant asthma-like symptoms, particularly those with a history of intubation, for timely diagnosis of tracheal stenosis.

### Thirty-five years of the European Society of Hypertension: from past to future [^114a4kHy]. Journal of Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

EUROPEAN SOCIETY OF HYPERTENSION GUIDELINES

Historically, essential hypertension represents one of the first clinical conditions for which diagnostic and therapeutic clinical guidelines have been developed. The first official guideline paper dates back to 1977 when the Joint National Committee in the United States released the document, which was revised few years later in a new paper jointly issued by an 'ad hoc' Committee of the WHO in conjunction with the International Society of Hypertension (ISH). During the last decade of the XX century, updated versions of the guidelines document have been prepared by the previously mentioned organizations in collaboration with American scientific societies. The first guideline document prepared by European Societies dates back to 2003, when the ESH together with the European Society of Cardiology jointly signed the European guidelines document. New guidelines followed in 2007, 2013 and 2018, the latter being as previously mentioned, the most frequently cited paper in the worldwide medical literature. The new guidelines document, released during the 32nd European Meeting on Hypertension held in Milan in 2023 and published in the Journal of Hypertension, represents the most updated document on the diagnosis and treatment of hypertension.

Although an in-depth analysis of the guidelines is beyond the scope of this article, it should be mentioned that the 2023 guidelines document addresses a number of critical issues in the field of hypertension diagnosis and treatment, also offering to the readers elements of novelties. These include, for example, the thresholds and targets of the blood pressure-lowering intervention, the relevance of out-of-office blood pressure measurements, the modern quantification of cardiovascular risk, the greater use of organ damage measures, the upgrading of beta-blocking drugs to the level of major antihypertensive agents and the wider choice of drug combination between major drugs, with confirmation of their strategic role as first-line and subsequent treatment in the majority of patients. Finally, emphasis has been given to the treatment strategies based on renal denervation, particularly but not exclusively in drug-resistant hypertension, and to the patient's follow-up modalities, including the careful assessment of nonadherence as a fundamental barrier to the long-term blood pressure control.

Finally, given the importance of primary care providers in the diagnostic and therapeutic approach to the hypertensive state, ESH has decided to provide a novel concise format of the guidelines, the so called '2024 Clinical Practice Guidelines', for implementation into current clinical practice. The four pillars of these practice guidelines include the accurate diagnostic approach, the assessment of the patient's cardiovascular risk profile, the careful selection of the treatment strategy and the long-term evaluation of the blood pressure response.

### The recommendations of a consensus panel for the screening, diagnosis, and treatment of neurogenic orthostatic hypotension and associated supine hypertension [^113sfH2Y]. Journal of Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

Supine hypertension associated with nOH

It is critical for clinicians to understand the physiology underlying both nOH and supine hypertension and the associated risks of each when they manage patients with nOH. Neurogenic OH is associated with loss of baroreflex function that normally buffers changes in blood pressure in both directions. Therefore, patients with autonomic nervous system dysfunction typically have nOH and supine hypertension. In addition to supine hypertension being common in patients with nOH, many of the medications used to treat nOH can cause or exacerbate supine hypertension. Because OH/nOH and supine hypertension are hemodynamic opposites, improving one can worsen the other. Thus, all patients with nOH should be evaluated for supine hypertension. There are differences in clinical practice among clinicians who treat nOH. Some clinicians may not treat nOH for fear of exacerbating supine hypertension, while others may aggressively treat nOH while accepting the resulting supine hypertension. Unlike the potential long-term consequences of hypertension in non-PD patients, the risks of nOH are immediate and represent potential major health threats. By extrapolation, similar recommendations can be made in multiple system atrophy. In contrast, the data is less clear in individuals with pure autonomic failure.

Hypertensive encephalopathy is primarily a diagnosis of exclusion after other causes of central nervous system dysfunction are ruled out, particularly stroke. It was probably more frequent at the time when the BP of the whole population was higher than currently, and patients were not treated intensively. According to old reports, it characteristically responds dramatically to acute lowering of BP.

### Diagnosis, evaluation, and management of high blood pressure in children and adolescents [^1137xiH3]. Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Systemic hypertension is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in adulthood. High blood pressure (HBP) and repeated measures of HBP, hypertension (HTN), begin in youth. Knowledge of how best to diagnose, manage, and treat systemic HTN in children and adolescents is important for primary and subspecialty care providers.

Objectives

To provide a technical summary of the methodology used to generate the 2017 "Clinical Practice Guideline for Screening and Management of High Blood Pressure in Children and Adolescents", an update to the 2004 "Fourth Report on the Diagnosis, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure in Children and Adolescents".

Data Sources

Medline, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Excerpta Medica Database references published between January 2003 and July 2015 followed by an additional search between August 2015 and July 2016.

Study Selection

English-language observational studies and randomized trials.

Methods

Key action statements (KASs) and additional recommendations regarding the diagnosis, management, and treatment of HBP in youth were the product of a detailed systematic review of the literature. A content outline establishing the breadth and depth was followed by the generation of 4 patient, intervention, comparison, outcome, time questions. Key questions addressed: (1) diagnosis of systemic HTN, (2) recommended work-up of systemic HTN, (3) optimal blood pressure (BP) goals, and (4) impact of high BP on indirect markers of cardiovascular disease in youth. Once selected, references were subjected to a 2-person review of the abstract and title followed by a separate 2-person full-text review. Full citation information, population data, findings, benefits and harms of the findings, as well as other key reference information were archived. Selected primary references were then used for KAS generation. Level of evidence (LOE) scoring was assigned for each reference and then in aggregate. Appropriate language was used to generate each KAS based on the LOE and the balance of benefit versus harm of the findings. Topics that could not be researched via the stated approach were (1) definition of HTN in youth, and (2) definition of left ventricular hypertrophy. KASs related to these stated topics were generated via expert opinion.

Results

Nearly 15000 references were identified during an initial literature search. After a deduplication process, 14382 references were available for title and abstract review, and 1379 underwent full text review. One hundred twenty-four experimental and observational studies published between 2003 and 2016 were selected as primary references for KAS generation, followed by an additional 269 primary references selected between August 2015 and July 2016. The LOE for the majority of references was C. In total, 30 KASs and 27 additional recommendations were generated; 12 were related to the diagnosis of HTN, 13 were related to management and additional diagnostic testing, 3 to treatment goals, and 2 to treatment options. Finally, special additions to the clinical practice guideline included creation of new BP tables based on BP values obtained solely from children with normal weight, creation of a simplified table to enhance screening and recognition of abnormal BP, and a revision of the criteria for diagnosing left ventricular hypertrophy.

Conclusions

### Pediatric pulmonary hypertension: guidelines from the American Heart Association and American Thoracic Society [^1167ywqT]. Circulation (2015). Low credibility.

Pulmonary hypertension is associated with diverse cardiac, pulmonary, and systemic diseases in neonates, infants, and older children and contributes to significant morbidity and mortality. However, current approaches to caring for pediatric patients with pulmonary hypertension have been limited by the lack of consensus guidelines from experts in the field. In a joint effort from the American Heart Association and American Thoracic Society, a panel of experienced clinicians and clinician-scientists was assembled to review the current literature and to make recommendations on the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of pediatric pulmonary hypertension. This publication presents the results of extensive literature reviews, discussions, and formal scoring of recommendations for the care of children with pulmonary hypertension.

### Delayed diagnosis of retroperitoneal paraganglioma in an 8-year-old boy with persistent hypertension: a case report and review of diagnostic challenges in pediatric secondary hypertension [^116YWSs6]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives

This study aims to highlight the rare yet significant cause of secondary hypertension in pediatric patients, specifically pheochromocytoma (PCC) and paraganglioma (PGL) and to discuss the diagnostic challenges and lessons learned from misdiagnosis in a pediatric case.

Case Presentation

We present the case of an 8-year-old boy with a 2-year history of sustained hypertension, initially attributed to brainstem encephalitis. Despite antihypertensive therapy, his blood pressure remained elevated. After 2 years, symptoms such as diaphoresis and failure to thrive prompted further investigation. Biochemical tests revealed elevated urinary normetanephrine levels, and imaging identified a retroperitoneal mass. The diagnosis of retroperitoneal paraganglioma was confirmed, and surgical intervention resulted in the normalization of blood pressure and symptom resolution during the 1-year follow-up.

Conclusions

This case underscores the importance of considering rare causes of secondary hypertension, such as PGL, even in the absence of classic symptoms. Early biochemical testing, appropriate imaging, and multidisciplinary follow-up are essential for accurate diagnosis and optimal management in pediatric hypertension. Genetic testing is also crucial, particularly in pediatric cases where hereditary factors are prevalent.

### Current diagnostic and treatment strategies for specific dilated cardiomyopathies: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^115BHomm]. Circulation (2016). Medium credibility.

Peripartum cardiomyopathy (PPCM) — diagnostic approach, multidisciplinary care, and tests: To confirm PPCM, a full history, physical examination, and diagnostic testing should be completed to exclude prior heart disease and other causes of cardiomyopathy, and for the classic definition the history should confirm onset of heart failure in the last months of pregnancy or the months after delivery with cardiac evaluation confirming LV dysfunction. Usual heart failure symptoms should prompt evaluation during the puerperium, symptoms may mimic normal pregnancy or other cardiopulmonary disease, and pregnancy-induced hypertension or preeclampsia has been found in up to 68% of patients presenting with PPCM. Timely diagnosis should occur to prevent treatment delay, multidisciplinary care should include specified specialists, and in suspected familial cases genetic testing and counseling could be helpful. The usual laboratory assessment for suspected cardiomyopathies should be completed, a chest radiograph should be performed to rule out other causes of dyspnea and to assess congestion, and an ECG should be performed to assess arrhythmias and LV hypertrophy, sinus tachycardia, and nonspecific ST–T–wave abnormalities. Natriuretic peptide levels are usually elevated, measurement of cardiac troponin at diagnosis can be considered given its moderate predictive ability for ventricular recovery with inverse correlation to LV recovery, and inflammatory markers are usually elevated but their role in diagnosis or prognosis is uncertain.

### Etiology of papilledema in patients in the eye clinic setting [^114RW81U]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

What is the likely etiology of papilledema among patients presenting to an eye clinic without a previously known cause?

Findings

In this population-based cross-sectional study including 86 patients diagnosed with papilledema, most patients (87%) were found to have idiopathic intracranial hypertension, while 13% presented with potentially life-threatening conditions, including intracranial tumor, cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, and granulomatous meningitis.

Meaning

All patients presenting with papilledema require neuroimaging; however, based on the results of this study, those with the typical demographic characteristics of idiopathic intracranial hypertension and lack of other neurologic symptoms may not need urgent neuroimaging, as long as the papilledema is not severe enough to threaten vision.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for hypertension, more specifically with respect to evaluation for renovascular and renal parenchymal disease, AAPA/ABC/ACC/ACPM/AGS/AHA/APhA/ASH/ASPC/NMA/PCNA 2018 guidelines recommend to obtain renal duplex Doppler ultrasound, MRA, or abdominal CT to evaluate for renovascular disease in patients meeting with HTN meeting any of the following criteria:

- resistant HTN, or increasingly difficult to control

- HTN of abrupt onset or worsening

- flash pulmonary edema

- early-onset HTN, especially in women

- abdominal systolic-diastolic bruit

- bruits over other arteries.

### Common clinical scenarios of systemic hypertension in the NICU [^111tr7vd]. NeoReviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Hypertension affects ∼1% to 3% of newborns in the NICU. However, the identification and management of hypertension can be challenging because of the lack of data-driven diagnostic criteria and management guidelines. In this review, we summarize the most recent approaches to diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of hypertension in neonates and infants. We also identify common clinical conditions in neonates in whom hypertension occurs, such as renal vascular and parenchymal disease, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and cardiac conditions, and address specific considerations for the evaluation and treatment of hypertension in those conditions. Finally, we discuss the importance of ongoing monitoring and long-term follow-up of infants diagnosed with hypertension.
