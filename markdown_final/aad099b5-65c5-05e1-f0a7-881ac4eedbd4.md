## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which option best represents an approach centered on managing complications in type 2 diabetes treatment, among SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists, basal insulin only, metformin plus DPP-4 inhibitor, or none of the above. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "complication-focused" means in current guidelines. Then, I should verify which drug classes have proven cardiovascular and renal outcome benefits. Next, I will examine the role of basal insulin and DPP-4 inhibitors in this context. Finally, I will synthesize and select the option that aligns with evidence-based, complication-driven care.

> Let me first confirm the definition of a complication-focused approach. Contemporary guidelines emphasize not just glycemic lowering but also reducing major adverse cardiovascular events, slowing chronic kidney disease progression, and preventing heart failure hospitalizations, often by choosing agents with proven cardiorenal benefits regardless of baseline HbA1c, especially in patients with or at high risk for ASCVD or CKD [^111ucKR7] [^117RJxxH] [^116uW7GJ].

> Now, I should verify which classes have robust outcome data. SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists are the only glucose-lowering classes with consistent reductions in cardiovascular events, mortality, and kidney outcomes in large randomized trials, and multiple high-credibility guidelines recommend prioritizing them in patients with established ASCVD or CKD, and even consider them early in broader risk profiles to prevent complications [^111ucKR7] [^117RJxxH] [^112bMqqZ].

> Wait, let me verify the role of basal insulin in a complication-focused strategy. Basal insulin lowers glucose but does not confer the same cardiovascular or renal outcome benefits seen with SGLT-2 inhibitors or GLP-1 receptor agonists; it remains important for symptomatic hyperglycemia or when oral/ injectable noninsulin therapy fails, but it is not the complication-prevention centerpiece here [^11698p33] [^111z47K2].

> Hold on, I should check the status of DPP-4 inhibitors. The American College of Physicians recommends against adding a DPP-4 inhibitor to metformin for the purpose of reducing morbidity or mortality, reflecting a lack of proven hard outcome benefit; thus, metformin plus DPP-4 inhibitor is not a complication-focused choice despite glycemic efficacy [^116EFrYW].

> Let me synthesize. The approach centered on managing complications prioritizes therapies with proven cardiorenal risk reduction; that is SGLT-2 inhibitors and/or GLP-1 receptor agonists, often layered onto foundational metformin when appropriate, rather than basal insulin monotherapy or metformin plus DPP-4 inhibitor, which lack the same outcome advantages in this domain [^111ucKR7] [^117RJxxH] [^112bMqqZ].

> I should double-check that I'm not overstating metformin's role here. Metformin remains first-line for glycemic control and has favorable safety, but it is not the agent that delivers the complication-specific outcome benefits in question; the complication-focused add-ons are SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists, which is why the correct answer is the first option [^111qNBNG] [^111ucKR7].

La respuesta correcta es **utilización de i-SGLT2 y análogos GLP-1** porque estos fármacos tienen beneficios comprobados en la reducción de complicaciones cardiovasculares y renales en la diabetes tipo 2, según guías actualizadas de ADA 2025 y ACP 2024 [^111ucKR7] [^112bMqqZ]. La insulina basal solo se usa cuando hay descompensación metabólica o falla de terapias orales, y la combinación de metformina con inhibidores de DPP-4 no demuestra reducción de eventos cardiovasculares o renales significativos [^11698p33] [^116EFrYW].

---

## Justificación clínica y basada en evidencia

### Inhibidores de SGLT2 y análogos de GLP-1

- **Beneficios cardiovasculares y renales**: Los inhibidores de SGLT2 y los análogos de GLP-1 han demostrado reducir significativamente eventos cardiovasculares mayores, la progresión de la enfermedad renal crónica y la hospitalización por insuficiencia cardiaca en pacientes con diabetes tipo 2 [^111ucKR7] [^117RJxxH].

- **Recomendaciones de guías clínicas**: La Asociación Americana de Diabetes (ADA) 2025 y la American College of Physicians (ACP) 2024 recomiendan la adición de un inhibidor de SGLT2 o un agonista de GLP-1 en pacientes con diabetes tipo 2 y control glucémico inadecuado, especialmente en presencia de comorbilidades cardiovasculares o renales [^111ucKR7] [^112bMqqZ].

- **Mecanismo de acción**: Los inhibidores de SGLT2 reducen la reabsorción renal de glucosa, promoviendo su eliminación urinaria y mejorando el control glucémico, mientras que los análogos de GLP-1 aumentan la secreción de insulina y reducen el apetito, contribuyendo a la pérdida de peso y al control glucémico [^116UwcpD].

---

### Insulina basal

La insulina basal se **reserva para casos de descompensación metabólica**, hiperglucemia severa sintomática o cuando las terapias orales e inyectables no logran el control glucémico deseado [^11698p33]. Su uso exclusivo no aborda directamente la prevención de complicaciones cardiovasculares y renales, y puede aumentar el riesgo de hipoglucemia y ganancia de peso.

---

### Metformina con inhibidores de DPP-4

La combinación de metformina con inhibidores de DPP-4 **no ha demostrado una reducción significativa en eventos cardiovasculares o renales** en comparación con otras terapias [^116EFrYW]. Su uso se limita principalmente al control glucémico sin beneficios comprobados en la reducción de complicaciones.

---

## Conclusión

El enfoque centrado en el manejo de complicaciones en la diabetes mellitus tipo 2 incluye la **utilización de inhibidores de SGLT2 y análogos de GLP-1**, ya que estos fármacos proporcionan beneficios comprobados en la reducción de complicaciones cardiovasculares y renales, según las guías clínicas más actualizadas [^111ucKR7] [^112bMqqZ].

### Clinical inertia in newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes mellitus among patients attending selected healthcare institutions in Colombia [^113jW3pZ]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2024). Medium credibility.

The implementation of strategies for an effective control of T2DM patients is fundamental to reduce microvascular and macrovascular complications associated with T2DM, improve quality of live, and decrease the costs associated.

Despite clinical advances in the management of T2DM, it has been reported that nearly 48% of the patients with T2DM do not achieve the recommended glycemic goal of HbA1c < 7%. Moreover, many patients already treated remain with poor glycemic control and don´t receive timely and appropriate intensification of therapy. This phenomenon has been called Clinical Inertia, defined as failure by healthcare providers to initiate or intensify treatment in a timely manner.

Reasons for clinical inertia in T2DM include lack of time and resources to address patient problems, overestimation of care provided, lack of communication between healthcare professionals and patients, non-adherence to medications, attitudes and beliefs of patients and community/cultural issues, among others. The negative impact of clinical inertia on glycemic control has been reported in several studies, so monitoring and controlling the extent of clinical inertia in clinical practice could be crucial in reducing the healthcare burden associated with T2DM.

The Colombian diabetes treatment guidelines "Guía de práctica clínica para el diagnóstico, tratamiento y seguimiento de la diabetes mellitus tipo 2 en la población mayor de 18 años" (CPG) were published in 2016 by the Ministry of Health. The purpose of this guideline is to recommend the best clinical practice, based on strong evidence, regarding screening, diagnosis, initial treatment, control, and detection of complications of T2DM for physicians. The guideline should be used by physicians on HMOs (see Fig. 1).

Fig. 1
Algorithm of initial pharmacological approach based on HbA1c cut-off points.

Adapted from Colombian diabetes guideline

In Colombia, to our knowledge, there is only two published studies that have measured clinical inertia in T2DM patients. Although these are representative studies, each one of them assessed only patients from one of the regimens (contributive or subsidized), so they did not show a complete picture of the Colombian population. In addition, one study was developed during 2015 and used ADA guidelines as a reference to measure clinical inertia, meanwhile Colombian National Guidelines were published in 2016. Thus, updated information regarding clinical inertia and the associated factors using more recent data may help healthcare policymakers and clinicians streamline strategies for reducing clinical inertia in T2DM and improve patient outcomes.

### Are there different viewpoints about the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus and comorbidities? A multidisciplinary Spanish qualitative research [^1168RZsk]. Diabetes Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Although high levels of agreement were obtained on all the issues assessed, this study shows that there is still room for improvement in terms of implementing strict glycaemic control, individualizing glycaemic control goals and opting for early treatment intensification, with most improvement to be gained amongst PC physicians. Further studies to evaluate the consequences of the lack of glycaemia control and the benefits of early treatment intensification with combinations of glucose-lowering molecules are necessary, and the findings may possibly contribute to achieving higher levels of agreement among physicians and specialists and a transformation of clinical practice.

### An algorithm for the treatment of type 2 diabetes in Latin America [^111gM3H3]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2005). Low credibility.

Diabetes is a principal and growing health concern in Latin America, accounting for significant mortality and morbidities. Large, randomized, prospective trials of various interventional therapies in patients with both type 1 and type 2 diabetes have demonstrated that reductions in hyperglycaemia and management of diabetes-related risk factors can significantly reduce the micro- and macrovascular complications of diabetes. Therefore, patients with type 2 diabetes will benefit from more aggressive treatment regimens to help decrease the occurrence and rate of progression of diabetic complications. Given the many complexities of diabetes management, it is often difficult for general practice physicians to stay abreast of emerging treatment strategies and therapies. Owing to the high prevalence of type 2 diabetes in Latin America, the majority of patients with diabetes are treated by generalists rather than specialists. This article was intended to assist physicians and other healthcare professionals in developing and using effective treatment strategies to stem the growing epidemic of diabetes and its complications in Latin America.

### Management of hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes: a patient-centered approach: position statement of the American diabetes association (ADA) and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) [^116qZT8W]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

Glycemic management in type 2 diabetes mellitus has become increasingly complex and, to some extent, controversial, with a widening array of pharmacological agents now available, mounting concerns about their potential adverse effects and new uncertainties regarding the benefits of intensive glycemic control on macrovascular complications. Many clinicians are therefore perplexed as to the optimal strategies for their patients. As a consequence, the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) convened a joint task force to examine the evidence and develop recommendations for antihyperglycemic therapy in nonpregnant adults with type 2 diabetes. Several guideline documents have been developed by members of these two organizations and by other societies and federations (,–). However, an update was deemed necessary because of contemporary information on the benefits/risks of glycemic control, recent evidence concerning efficacy and safety of several new drug classes, the withdrawal/restriction of others, and increasing calls for a move toward more patient-centered care.

This statement has been written incorporating the best available evidence and, where solid support does not exist, using the experience and insight of the writing group, incorporating an extensive review by additional experts (acknowledged below). The document refers to glycemic control; yet this clearly needs to be pursued within a multifactorial risk reduction framework. This stems from the fact that patients with type 2 diabetes are at increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality; the aggressive management of cardiovascular risk factors (blood pressure and lipid therapy, antiplatelet treatment, and smoking cessation) is likely to have even greater benefits.

These recommendations should be considered within the context of the needs, preferences, and tolerances of each patient; individualization of treatment is the cornerstone of success. Our recommendations are less prescriptive than and not as algorithmic as prior guidelines. This follows from the general lack of comparative-effectiveness research in this area. Our intent is therefore to encourage an appreciation of the variable and progressive nature of type 2 diabetes, the specific role of each drug, the patient and disease factors that drive clinical decision making, and the constraints imposed by age and comorbidity. The implementation of these guidelines will require thoughtful clinicians to integrate current evidence with other constraints and imperatives in the context of patient-specific factors.

### Management of hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes: evidence and uncertainty [^114hzRPs]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2013). Low credibility.

The panoply of treatment algorithms, periodically released to improve guidance, is one mean to face therapeutic uncertainty in pharmacological management of hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes, especially after metformin failure. Failure of recent guidelines to give advice on the use of specific antidiabetic drugs in patients with co-morbidity may generate further uncertainty, given the frequent association of type 2 diabetes with common comorbidity, including, although not limited to obesity, cardiovascular disease, impaired renal function, and frailty. The Italian Association of Diabetologists (Associazione Medici Diabetologi, AMD) recognized the need to develop personalized treatment plans for people with type 2 diabetes, taking into account the patients' individual profile (phenotype), with the objective of the safest possible glycemic control. As not every subject with type 2 diabetes benefits from intensive glycemic control, flexible regimens of treatment with diabetes drugs (including insulin) are needed for reaching individualized glycemic goals. Whether personalized diabetology will improve the quality healthcare practice of diabetes management is unknown, but specific research has been launched.

### Clinical inertia is the enemy of therapeutic success in the management of diabetes and its complications: a narrative literature review [^114bQajU]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2020). Medium credibility.

Diabetes mellitus is a chronic disease characterized by high social, economic and health burden, mostly due to the high incidence and morbidity of diabetes complications. Numerous studies have shown that optimizing metabolic control may reduce the risk of micro and macrovascular complications related to the disease, and the algorithms suggest that an appropriate and timely step of care intensification should be proposed after 3 months from the failure to achieve metabolic goals. Nonetheless, many population studies show that glycemic control in diabetic patients is often inadequate. The phenomenon of clinical inertia in diabetology, defined as the failure to start a therapy or its intensification/de-intensification when appropriate, has been studied for almost 20 years, and it is not limited to diabetes care, but also affects other specialties. In the present manuscript, we have documented the issue of inertia in its complexity, assessing its dimensions, its epidemiological weight, and its burden over the effectiveness of care. Our main goal is the identification of the causes of clinical inertia in diabetology, and the quantification of its social and health-related consequences through the adoption of appropriate indicators, in an effort to advance possible solutions and proposals to fight and possibly overcome clinical inertia, thus improving health outcomes and quality of care.

1 Introduction

Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a chronic disease whose treatment requires an individualised and integrated approach to prevent long‐term complications and optimise quality of life. Currently, T2D care is based on glycaemic and weight management, and control of cardiovascular (CV) risk factors. Glycaemic control is usually assessed by the serum levels of glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c), which correlate to diabetes complications in the long term. A reasonable HbA1c target for most people with T2D is around 7%, but people with longer life expectancy and those without major comorbidities may benefit from stringent HbA1c goals (HbA1c 6.5% or lower), if safely achieved, which have been proven to prevent microvascular complications later in life. HbA1c goals should be pursued early after diagnosis: a better prognosis has been observed in patients who begin intensive therapy early after diagnosis than in those who achieve optimal HbA1c levels later in the course of the disease. Early intervention is also particularly beneficial in those with a longer life expectancy, as younger people with T2D should be considered at very high risk for complications. Weight control is also central in T2D management. The American Diabetes Association (ADA)/European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) and the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines recommend a minimum weight loss of 5%–10% to obtain metabolic improvements, while reductions of higher magnitude (10%–15%) have shown disease‐modifying effects, meaning an improved glycaemic control in the presence of a reduced need for diabetes medications or even disease remission. Weight loss has been shown to have a positive impact on HbA1c levels and is associated with a reduced risk of CV disease (CVD). However, some studies have highlighted the difficulties faced by people with T2D in achieving these objectives.

### Comment on: inzucchi et al. management of hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes: a patient-centered approach. position statement of the American diabetes association (ADA) and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD). Diabetes care 2012; 35: 1364–1379 [^1147U5cz]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

The two Italian scientific diabetes societies (Società Italiana di Diabetologia and Associazione Medici Diabetologi) have provided specific recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of diabetes and its complications, including recommendations for oral medications for type 2 diabetes. An original processing system was used to create these recommendations: the document prepared by the editorial team was published online for 20 days, and the suggestions and criticisms of all of the members were evaluated and integrated with those from a panel of specialists and members of other health care professions committed to diabetes care, as well as lay members, including patient representatives. More importantly, each statement is accompanied by a predefined 6-scale grade of force and evidence for the recommendation, which helps the reader in distinguishing between opinion and proof.

We hereby recognize that the last consensus statement is based on evidence more than the previous ones. Actually, we are glad to observe that the proposed flowchart is almost identical to what has been proposed in the Italian document. Further, the choice between different therapeutic opportunities is predominantly based on well-known possible side effects (or absence of side effects) instead of pathophysiological wishes, with an attempt to cope with the patients' needs. Nevertheless, the absence of any grade of evidence (the only grade is the eventual presence of a question mark) still leaves the readers too free to interpret them, assuring the false perception that their prescription/interpretation is following the American Diabetes Association and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes proposed consensus. Guidelines should serve as reference. A nonexpert practitioner can be particularly puzzled by the unexplained mix of evidence and opinions, especially if the latter change profoundly between the various consensus versions; the experts will read these consensus just to stimulate (successful) debates.

We hope, for the future, that other models of reporting graded evidences, as ours, will be taken into account.

### Meeting individualized glycemic targets in primary care patients with type 2 diabetes in Spain [^1156G6dc]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Recent clinical guidelines and expert committees on the management of type 2 diabetes have recommended individualization of glycemic targets based on patient characteristics, comorbid conditions, diabetes complications, duration of diabetes and risk of hypoglycemia. The American Diabetes Association and European Association for the Study of Diabetes (ADA/EASD) recommended a target HbA1c level < 7% (53 mmol/mol) for most patients with type 2 diabetes, however, a more relaxed target (HbA1c 7.5–8% (58–64 mmol/mol)) should be aimed in patients with multiple comorbidities, reduced life expectancy, history of hypoglycemia, or advanced diabetes complications. On the other hand, a more stringent target such as HbA1c < 6.5% (48 mmol/mol) was considered beneficial in younger patients without comorbid conditions and with no adverse effects of antihyperglycemic treatment. Similarly, the national consensus from the Sociedad Española de Diabetes (SED – Spanish Diabetes Society) recommended a stringent HbA1c target of < 6.5% (48 mmol/mol) in patients with newly diagnosed diabetes, age < 70 years, and absence of diabetic complications, otherwise, a less stringent HbA1c goal of < 7.5% (58 mmol/mol) should be the target in the absence of these conditions. The American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) also recommends the individualization of glycemic targets taking into account several factors that include concurrent illnesses and risk of hypoglycemia.

### Are diabetes management guidelines applicable in' real life'? [^117731s8]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

Both the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) have published algorithms for management of hyperglycemia in patients with type 2 diabetes. According to these algorithms, the first step of diabetes treatment should consist of lifestyle intervention plus metformin. If optimal glycemic control is not achieved, step two consists of addition of either a sulphonylurea or basal insulin. These recommendations have not, however, been tested in real-life settings. In Brazil, most patients with type 2 diabetes are treated at primary care clinics and have access to metformin, sulfonylureas, and NPH insulin, which are provided free of charge by the public health care system, the Unified Health System (Sistema Único de Saúde, SUS). Therefore, the aim of this study was to analyze whether an HbA 1c level of < 7.0% can be achieved and maintained in patients with type 2 diabetes treated at a primary care clinic in accordance with ADA/EASD guidelines.

### Is time ready for combination therapy at diagnosis of type 2 diabetes? [^112VoQt7]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Emerging evidence is showing a range of beneficial effects for GLP-1 receptor agonists and especially SGLT-2 inhibitors on the cardio-renal axis in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and cardiovascular diseases (CVD). Preliminary findings suggest that: 1- such benefit extends also to patients with T2D without pre-existing CVD; and 2- background therapies do not modify the effect of these drugs. Given these considerations, some authors advanced the hypothesis that these novel agents might undermine the first-line position of metformin in the treatment algorithm of T2D. Here, we briefly discuss some pros and cons of such scenario, proposing a "starting" combination therapy with metformin plus one novel agent with trial-proven benefit as the best option to make use of the available knowledge and minimize the risk of complications in patients with newly diagnosed T2D.

### The early treatment of type 2 diabetes [^111toY7V]. The American Journal of Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

The growing epidemic of type 2 diabetes is one of the leading causes of premature morbidity and mortality worldwide, mainly due to the micro- and macrovascular complications associated with the disease. A growing body of evidence suggests that although the risk of developing complications is greater with glucose levels beyond the established threshold for diagnosis — increasing in parallel with rising hyperglycemia-individuals with glucose levels in the prediabetic range are already at increased risk. Early intervention, ideally as soon as abnormalities in glucose homeostasis are detected, is of great importance to minimize the burden of the disease. However, as the early stages of the disease are asymptomatic, diagnosing prediabetes and early overt type 2 diabetes is challenging. The aim of this article is to discuss these challenges, the benefits of early intervention — with emphasis on the prevention trials showing that progression to type 2 diabetes can be delayed by addressing prediabetes — and the existing evidence-based guidelines that have been drawn to optimize the standards of care at the prediabetes and overt type 2 diabetes stages.

### American diabetes association-European Association for the Study of Diabetes position statement: due diligence was conducted [^112Kat4i]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

In regard to the message delivered from previously published guidelines, there are providers who strongly feel that given the overall scope of the diabetes burden worldwide and the fact that data continue to state inadequate glycemic control today, an algorithm-based approach should not only be emphasized but also justified. Additional justification for this approach is that it provides a consistent management plan and serves an important purpose to guide providers who may not be as versed in diabetes management. Given the fact that most diabetic patients are not seen in specialized centers, the argument is made that an algorithm-based approach may provide the most feasible management plan that can be applied to the greatest number of subjects. A more defined prescriptive approach is also supported by those who feel that we should reserve the newer therapies only after the traditional agents have failed. In support of this position, the available cost-effectiveness data are cited (although, admittedly, we have very little to date). In addition, the cost of the medication and expense involved in monitoring may be provided as compelling reasons for choosing the specific management approach. On the opposite end of this argument, there is the camp of providers who feel strongly that so much data has accumulated on the pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes that a specific pharmaceutical approach is warranted in that direction. In reality, however, the majority of providers seem to fall squarely between the two management approaches described above. Basing their decision on a number of important factors, they would suggest the use of all agents. This latter approach essentially selects a particular therapy after carefully considering all relevant factors (e.g. comorbidities, disease duration, resources, etc.) that contribute to the ultimate success or failure of the therapy. The approach to consider all factors and individualize therapy is the approach taken in the ADA-EASD position statement. In this regard, the position statement definitely achieves its objectives.

### Issues for the management of people with diabetes and COVID-19 in ICU [^111T1Xjk]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Managing people with diabetes in any acute setting is always very difficult. COVID-19 has a very severe prognosis for people with diabetes and evidence shows that a tight glucose control could be very helpful. In the case of COVID-19 people with diabetes are more exposed to cardiovascular complications, which may be more challenging to manage.

The usefulness of several biomarkers suggested for evaluating/monitoring the severity of the disease might be less evident and their use needs a careful evaluation in the case of diabetes.

Even though we understand that in such a critical situation some of these requests are not so easy to implement, we believe that the best possible action to prevent a worse outcome is essential in any medical act.

### Algorithm for the treatment of type 2 diabetes: a position statement of Brazilian diabetes society [^112NE3ve]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2010). Low credibility.

The Brazilian Diabetes Society is starting an innovative project of quantitative assessment of medical arguments of and implementing a new way of elaborating SBD Position Statements. The final aim of this particular project is to propose a new Brazilian algorithm for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, based on the opinions of endocrinologists surveyed from a poll conducted on the Brazilian Diabetes Society website regarding the latest algorithm proposed by American Diabetes Association /European Association for the Study of Diabetes, published in January 2009. An additional source used, as a basis for the new algorithm, was to assess the acceptability of controversial arguments published in international literature, through a panel of renowned Brazilian specialists. Thirty controversial arguments in diabetes have been selected with their respective references, where each argument was assessed and scored according to its acceptability level and personal conviction of each member of the evaluation panel. This methodology was adapted using a similar approach to the one adopted in the recent position statement by the American College of Cardiology on coronary revascularization, of which not only cardiologists took part, but also specialists of other related areas.

PATIENT-CENTERED APPROACH

Evidence-based advice depends on the existence of primary source evidence. This emerges only from clinical trial results in highly selected patients, using limited strategies. It does not address the range of choices available, or the order of use of additional therapies. Even if such evidence were available, the data would show median responses and not address the vital question of who responded to which therapy and why. Patient-centered care is defined as an approach to "providing care that is respectful of and responsive to individual patient preferences, needs, and values and ensuring that patient values guide all clinical decisions". This should be the organizing principle underlying health care for individuals with any chronic disease, but given our uncertainties in terms of choice or sequence of therapy, it is particularly appropriate in type 2 diabetes. Ultimately, it is patients who make the final decisions regarding their lifestyle choices and, to some degree, the pharmaceutical interventions they use; their implementation occurs in the context of the patients' real lives and relies on the consumption of resources (both public and private).

Patient involvement in the medical decision making constitutes one of the core principles of evidence-based medicine, which mandates the synthesis of best available evidence from the literature with the clinician's expertise and patient's own inclinations. During the clinical encounter, the patient's preferred level of involvement should be gauged and therapeutic choices explored, potentially with the utilization of decision aids. In a shared decision-making approach, clinician and patient act as partners, mutually exchanging information and deliberating on options, in order to reach a consensus on the therapeutic course of action. There is good evidence supporting the effectiveness of this approach. Importantly, engaging patients in health care decisions may enhance adherence to therapy.

### Are diabetes management guidelines applicable in' real life'? [^112oeNwm]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The American Diabetes Association (ADA) has published several diabetes treatment algorithms, but none have been tested in real-life settings. The aim of this study is to analyze the feasibility of achieving and/or maintaining HbA1c levels < 7.0% using current diabetes treatment guidelines and the resources available in the public health care system of Brazil.

Methods

A one-year, single-arm interventional study was conducted with type 2 diabetes patients in a primary care unit. Intervention consisted of intensification of lifestyle changes and sequential prescription of drugs based on ADA guidelines using the medications available through the publicly funded Unified Health System (Sistema Único de Saúde, SUS).

Results

Ninety patients (age: 62.7 ± 10.4 years; diabetes duration: 8.2 ± 9.1 years) completed the trial. During the intervention period, increases were observed in number of oral antidiabetic agent (OAD) classes per patient (1.50 ± 0.74 vs. 1.67 ± 0.7; p = 0.015), OAD pills per patient (2.64 ± 1.89 vs. 3.33 ± 2.23 pills/patient; p < 0.001), insulin dosage (0.20 ± 0.29 vs.0.50 ± 0.36 UI/kg/day; p = 0.008) and number of patients on insulin (19 [21%] vs. 31 [34%]; p < 0.01), but no improvement in HbA1c (7.2 ± 1.6% vs. 7.3 ± 1.5%; p = 0.453) or frequency of patients on target, defined as HbA1c < 7% (53.3% vs. 48.9%; p = 0.655). Patients with baseline HbA1c < 7% had a small increase in HbA1c during the trial (6.3 ± 0.4 vs. 6.7 ± 0.9%; p = 0.002). No such change was observed in those with baseline HbA1c ≥ 7%.

Conclusions

In this group of patients with a mean baseline HbA1c of 7.2%, implementation of 2006/2009 ADA/EASD guidelines led to achievement of the therapeutic goal of HbA1c < 7% in a small proportion of patients.

Summary of evidence

Metformin is the first-line agent of choice for treatment of T2DM, given its established efficacy, safety profile, low incidence of hypoglycemia and low cost. The efficacy of metformin in reducing diabetes-related outcomes was demonstrated in overweight and obese patients in the UKDPS 34 trial. The objective of UKPDS 34 was to investigate whether intensive blood-glucose control (treating to a fasting blood glucose of 108 mg/dL) with metformin, a sulfonylurea or insulin had any specific advantage or disadvantage. In a randomized controlled clinical trial, of 4075 patients recruited to UKPDS, 1704 overweight patients with newly diagnosed T2DM (with baseline fasting blood glucose 110–270 mg/dL) were assigned to either conventional treatment with diet alone (n = 411), intensive control with metformin (n = 342) or intensive control with a sulfonylurea or insulin (n = 951). The median duration was 10.7 years. The primary outcome measures were: any diabetes-related clinical endpoint, diabetes-related death, and all-cause mortality. Overall mean HbA 1c at baseline was 7.2 ± 1.5%. Compared with the conventional group, patients in the metformin group had risk reductions of 32% (95% CI 13–47, p = 0.002) for any diabetes-related endpoint, 42% for diabetes-related death (9–63, p = 0.017), and 36% for all-cause mortality (9–55, p = 0.011). Among patients allocated to intensive blood glucose control, metformin showed a greater effect than chlorpropamide, glibenclamide, or insulin for any diabetes-related endpoint (p = 0.0034), all-cause mortality (p = 0.021), and stroke (p = 0.032). Intensive glucose control with metformin decreased the risk of diabetes-related endpoints in overweight diabetic patients, and was associated with less weight gain and fewer hypoglycemic attacks than are insulin and sulfonylureas. It is thus the first-line pharmacological therapy of choice in these patients.
Important note: This panel strongly recommends that, before initiating any treatment with antidiabetic agents, the eGFR should be estimated in every patient and the drug initiated only if in accordance with the product label. In the case of metformin, it should not be initiated when eGFR is below 45 mL/min/1.73 m² and should be discontinued whenever eGFR is below 30 mL/min/1.73 m², due to the risk of metabolic acidosis.

### Insights into the management of type 2 diabetes at diagnosis in Spain: the NEW2TYPE2 study [^115PWBgH]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

ABSTRACT

Introduction

This study analysed the opinions and perceptions of Spanish physicians towards the management of people newly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes (T2D) aged ≤ 65 years.

Methods

Online survey targeting primary care physicians (PCPs) and endocrinologists (members of three national scientific societies) treating people with T2D. Management practices and factors determining prescribed therapies and treatment goals were captured in general and by patient profile. The respondents' perception of the limitations in setting strict glycaemic control objectives and weight loss targets, and the feasibility and impact of possible solutions, were examined.

Results

A total of 105 physicians (60% PCPs, 40% endocrinologists) responded to the survey; 98% of respondents reported following clinical practice guidelines; 53.3% and 27.6% considered stringent glycaemic control to be HbA1c levels of 6.0%–6.5% and 6.5%–7.0%, respectively. In patient profiles with overweight/obesity, > 90% reported setting weight loss goals, with 5%–10% weight loss being the most common target. The most limiting factors for the establishment of stringent glycaemic and weight loss targets were the lack of awareness of self‐care of the disease (74.3%) and the cost to the healthcare system of the most effective drugs (72.4%). Training and the implementation of simple protocols and algorithms were the solutions perceived as having the greatest impact and feasibility. Redefining visa criteria was considered the solution with the highest impact.

Conclusions

The results are consistent with clinical practice guidelines' recommendations in Spain, but early and intensive interventions focused on reducing the risk of long‐term complications in people with T2D who have longer life expectancy could be promoted at diagnosis.

Combination therapy thresholds and insulin initiation in type 2 diabetes (T2D) are specified: "For newly diagnosed persons with T2D and an A1C ≥ 9.0% and/or ≥ 1.5% above target, one should initiate, along with lifestyle modifications, oral possibly triple combination pharmacotherapy usually including metformin and considering basal insulin". When there are "significant symptoms of hyperglycemia" or "a very high A1C > 10% (86 mmol/mol) or BG levels (≥ 300 mg/dL [16.7 mmol/L]), insulin is recommended". Metformin can be combined with other agents, but clinicians should "avoid its use in persons with CKD (eGFR < 30 ml/min/1.73 m²) or GI intolerance".

ANTIHYPERGLYCEMIC THERAPY

Glycemic targets

The ADA's "Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes" recommends lowering HbA 1c to < 7.0% in most patients to reduce the incidence of microvascular disease. This can be achieved with a mean plasma glucose of ∼8.3–8.9 mmol/L (∼150–160 mg/dL); ideally, fasting and premeal glucose should be maintained at < 7.2 mmol/L (< 130 mg/dL) and the postprandial glucose at < 10 mmol/L (< 180 mg/dL). More stringent HbA 1c targets (e.g. 6.0–6.5%) might be considered in selected patients (with short disease duration, long life expectancy, no significant CVD) if this can be achieved without significant hypoglycemia or other adverse effects of treatment. Conversely, less stringent HbA 1c goals — e.g. 7.5–8.0% or even slightly higher — are appropriate for patients with a history of severe hypoglycemia, limited life expectancy, advanced complications, extensive comorbid conditions and those in whom the target is difficult to attain despite intensive self-management education, repeated counseling, and effective doses of multiple glucose-lowering agents, including insulin.

The accumulated results from the aforementioned type 2 diabetes cardiovascular trials suggest that not everyone benefits from aggressive glucose management. It follows that it is important to individualize treatment targets (,–). The elements that may guide the clinician in choosing an HbA 1c target for a specific patient are shown in Fig. 1. As mentioned earlier, the desires and values of the patient should also be considered, since the achievement of any degree of glucose control requires active participation and commitment. Indeed, any target could reflect an agreement between patient and clinician. An important related concept is that the ease with which more intensive targets are reached influences treatment decisions; logically, lower targets are attractive if they can be achieved with less complex regimens and no or minimal adverse effects. Importantly, utilizing the percentage of diabetic patients who are achieving an HbA 1c < 7.0% as a quality indicator, as promulgated by various health care organizations, is inconsistent with the emphasis on individualization of treatment goals.
