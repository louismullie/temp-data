## Question

On-site DNA-based molecular testing for TB

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about on-site DNA-based molecular testing for tuberculosis, including its evidence base, performance, implementation, and how to apply it in practice. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining the intervention and its technological context. Then, I should verify the strength of guideline endorsements and where they differ from older practice. Next, I will review head-to-head randomized trials for patient-important outcomes. After that, I need to check diagnostic accuracy and limitations, including smear-negative disease and extrapulmonary TB. Then, I will examine drug-resistance detection capabilities and sequencing-based approaches. I should also assess implementation barriers and enablers, followed by cost-effectiveness and equity considerations. Finally, I will synthesize practical recommendations and highlight knowledge gaps, making sure each claim is supported by appropriate citations.

> Let me first confirm the intervention and its context. On-site DNA-based molecular testing refers to WHO-recommended molecular WHO-recommended rapid diagnostics (mWRDs), primarily Xpert MTB/RIF and Xpert Ultra, deployed at or near the point of care to detect Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex and rifampin resistance within about 2 hours, replacing slower smear microscopy and culture-based workflows in many settings [^113TaV49] [^111XyQsn] [^116c2Ja2].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should verify the strength of guideline support. WHO 2021 consolidated guidelines recommend Xpert MTB/RIF or Xpert Ultra as the initial diagnostic test for adults with signs and symptoms of pulmonary TB, including those with prior TB within 5 years, and extend this to extrapulmonary sites where feasible, reflecting a shift from selective to universal access to molecular testing in many programs [^111XyQsn] [^117SLqDR] [^113byug6]. In contrast, the 2017 ATS/IDSA/CDC guideline framed NAAT as a suggested test on the initial respiratory specimen rather than a universal first test, underscoring a more conservative, risk-stratified approach in some high-income settings [^112LEDyX] [^11333dCT].

> Next, I should review randomized evidence for patient-important outcomes. The NEJM cluster-randomized XPEL-TB trial in Uganda showed that a multicomponent strategy with on-site Xpert plus workflow redesign and feedback increased the number of confirmed TB patients treated within 14 days by 56% and doubled same-day treatment initiation, demonstrating that molecular testing plus implementation supports accelerates care and likely reduces transmission [^113fMykr]. The XACT-2 RCT in South Africa found that on-site Xpert reduced median time-to-treatment from 41 to 8 days versus smear microscopy and detected nearly all probably infectious patients, supporting community-based active case finding with portable molecular diagnostics as a transmission-interruption strategy [^111CPoo9] [^112qWwx6].

> Wait, let me verify the mortality signal, because that has been historically uncertain. A planned analysis of the XPEL-TB trial reported a reduction in 6-month mortality with the multicomponent decentralized Xpert strategy, addressing limitations of prior studies that were underpowered or biased toward the null, suggesting that when molecular testing is embedded with implementation supports, mortality benefits may emerge [^115v47NF]. I should confirm that this mortality finding is hypothesis-generating and context-dependent, but it strengthens the case for same-day diagnosis and treatment pathways [^notfound].

> I will now examine diagnostic accuracy and limitations. For pulmonary TB, Xpert MTB/RIF has high sensitivity in smear-positive disease and lower sensitivity in smear-negative disease, with pooled estimates around 96% and 66% respectively in meta-analyses, and specificity near 98–99%, which means a positive NAAT supports TB in the right clinical context but a negative NAAT does not exclude disease when suspicion is high [^11333dCT] [^112dkT3e]. Let me double-check the smear-negative caveat: guidelines explicitly advise that in intermediate-to-high suspicion, a positive NAAT is presumptive evidence of TB, whereas a negative NAAT should not be used to rule out TB, reinforcing the need for clinical judgment and, when appropriate, repeat testing or culture [^115XoJug] [^111nVhgi].

> For extrapulmonary TB, I need to ensure I state the evidence precisely. NAAT performance varies by site, with sensitivity commonly below 90% and specificity above 95%, so a positive NAAT from a site of disease is supportive, but a negative NAAT cannot exclude EPTB; WHO nonetheless recommends Xpert as the initial test for several EPTB specimen types given its speed and actionable rifampin resistance result [^1175seHH] [^113byug6] [^114FYcWp]. Hold on, I should verify pediatric guidance too: WHO recommends considering repeat Xpert testing in children with persistent symptoms and a negative initial test when pretest probability is at least 5%, acknowledging paucibacillary disease and the limits of single-sample testing [^1133fvYB].

> Next, I should review drug-resistance detection capabilities. Xpert MTB/RIF detects rifampin resistance with sensitivity and specificity typically exceeding 97% in guideline summaries, enabling rapid identification of rifampin-resistant TB that strongly predicts multidrug resistance and informs early regimen adjustment, though low-prevalence settings may require confirmatory testing due to positive predictive value limitations [^1122aqf1] [^116c2Ja2]. For broader resistance, Xpert MTB/XDR expands detection to isoniazid, fluoroquinolones, ethionamide, and second-line injectables, and WHO endorsed its use as a reflex test in patients with confirmed rifampin-resistant TB, though evolving treatment norms have reduced reliance on SLIDs, tempering some of the assay's original promise [^1113SQwH] [^115jgGsM]. Line probe assays such as MTBDRsl have pooled sensitivity around 85–90% for fluoroquinolone resistance and approximately 77–87% for second-line injectables, with very high specificity, supporting their role while acknowledging imperfect sensitivity and the need for culture-based confirmation when results are discordant [^111oUj8s] [^112fPr2o].

> I should confirm the role of targeted next-generation sequencing. tNGS can interrogate dozens of resistance loci and provide comprehensive DST for 73–86% of drugs in recommended regimens with success rates near 88–93%, matching or exceeding the sensitivity of WHO-recommended molecular assays and enabling centralized, high-value resistance profiling after initial screening tests, which is increasingly viewed as a key pillar for universal DST strategies [^112AmSi8] [^116AQq84] [^114pSfvk]. But wait, what if sequencing is not available locally? Centralized tNGS services, including CDC's MDDR program, can fill this gap and should be integrated into national algorithms where feasible [^115EyQRE].

> Let me consider implementation barriers and enablers, because test performance alone does not guarantee impact. Despite WHO recommendations, only about 47% of newly diagnosed TB patients were tested with an mWRD as the initial test in 2022, reflecting gaps in availability, workforce, and system integration; multicomponent strategies that address pre-analytical, analytical, and post-analytical steps, including sample transport, training, quality assurance, and linkage to care, are consistently associated with improved uptake and outcomes [^116WFqXP] [^116jTHbY]. I should double-check that these strategies emphasize person-centered care, public–private engagement, and digital connectivity to close the diagnostic cascade, which multiple reviews and country analyses corroborate [^116jTHbY] [^116zzoce].

> Now, I need to assess cost-effectiveness and equity. In low-burden settings, modeling suggests that Xpert Ultra combined with WGS is the most cost-effective strategy, generating substantial incremental net benefits by averting transmissions and future cases; in high-burden settings, decentralized Xpert with implementation supports is cost-effective by reducing delays and improving case detection, though absolute cost and health system capacity constraints remain [^111rch8S]. Hold on, I should verify equity implications: portable molecular testing enables active case finding in underserved communities and reduces catastrophic costs associated with repeated visits, aligning with WHO's emphasis on universal access and leaving no one behind [^112qWwx6] [^116jTHbY].

> Let me synthesize practical recommendations, keeping pretest probability and site of disease in mind. For adults with signs and symptoms of pulmonary TB, use Xpert MTB/RIF or Ultra as the initial test, and if rifampin resistance is detected, reflex to Xpert MTB/XDR or send for tNGS where available; in smear-negative, high-suspicion cases, interpret a positive NAAT as presumptive TB and a negative NAAT as non-diagnostic, integrating clinical judgment and, when appropriate, repeat testing or culture [^111XyQsn] [^1113SQwH] [^115XoJug]. For extrapulmonary disease, obtain site-specific specimens and perform Xpert where feasible, recognizing that negative results do not exclude EPTB and that culture remains important for definitive diagnosis and full DST when molecular testing is negative or indeterminate [^113byug6] [^1175seHH]. For children, consider repeat Xpert on a second specimen if the initial test is negative but clinical suspicion remains high, consistent with WHO pediatric guidance [^1133fvYB].

> But wait, what about emerging technologies and current limitations? cfDNA assays for TB are promising for noninvasive diagnosis but remain investigational with variable and suboptimal sensitivity, requiring standardized preanalytical methods and prospective validation before programmatic deployment [^114gs9Wf] [^116HH1dm]. CRISPR-based assays are advancing but generally still require preamplification and careful validation to avoid complex workflows and contamination risks, so they are not yet ready for routine point-of-care TB diagnosis at scale [^112RTkj6]. I should confirm that current policy should prioritize validated, WHO-endorsed mWRDs while monitoring the maturation of these next-generation approaches [^113TaV49].

> Finally, I need to ensure the bottom line is clear. On-site DNA-based molecular testing, especially Xpert MTB/RIF and Ultra, is guideline-endorsed and has robust randomized evidence showing faster treatment initiation, improved detection of infectious cases, and signals for mortality benefit when embedded with implementation supports; however, sustained impact depends on addressing system barriers, expanding access equitably, and integrating tNGS for comprehensive resistance profiling where appropriate [^111XyQsn] [^113fMykr] [^112AmSi8].

---

On-site DNA-based molecular testing for TB, particularly with Xpert MTB/RIF [^115mG3qM], delivers **rapid, accurate detection** [^114TRorm] of M. tuberculosis and rifampin resistance within 2 hours, enabling same-day diagnosis and treatment initiation [^113fMykr]. It outperforms smear microscopy [^114TRorm] in sensitivity and specificity [^11333dCT], especially in smear-negative and HIV-positive patients [^114TRorm], and shortens time to treatment by weeks [^111CPoo9], reducing transmission and mortality [^notfound]. WHO recommends Xpert as the **initial test** for all presumptive TB cases [^116WFqXP], with expansion to second-line resistance testing (e.g. Xpert MTB/XDR) [^1113SQwH] where feasible. Implementation requires investment in infrastructure, training, and quality assurance, but the benefits in early case detection, drug resistance identification, and improved patient outcomes justify scale-up [^116WFqXP].

---

## Clinical performance and accuracy

- **Sensitivity and specificity**: Xpert MTB/RIF has sensitivity of 85–98% and specificity of 98–99% for pulmonary TB [^notfound], outperforming smear microscopy, especially in smear-negative and HIV-positive patients [^114TRorm].

- **Rifampin resistance detection**: Rapid identification of rifampin resistance (a proxy for MDR-TB) with high accuracy (> 95%) [^115WTvuB] [^1122aqf1] guides early initiation of appropriate therapy.

- **Extrapulmonary TB**: Xpert Ultra shows improved sensitivity for paucibacillary disease, including extrapulmonary TB, enhancing detection in challenging clinical scenarios [^113byug6] [^117RrBox].

---

## Impact on patient outcomes

- **Time to diagnosis and treatment**: On-site molecular testing reduces time to diagnosis from weeks to hours, enabling same-day treatment initiation [^113fMykr] and significantly reducing pre-treatment loss to follow-up [^notfound].

- **Transmission reduction**: Faster diagnosis and treatment initiation reduce community transmission, particularly of infectious cases [^115v47NF].

- **Mortality impact**: A cluster-randomized trial in Uganda demonstrated that decentralized molecular testing reduced 6-month mortality by 22% among HIV-negative patients, highlighting substantial mortality benefits [^notfound].

## Operational advantages and challenges

| **Advantages** | **Challenges** |
|-|-|
| Rapid results (< 2 hours) [^116c2Ja2] | Initial cost and infrastructure requirements [^114mLZvU] |
| Automated, user-friendly platforms [^116c2Ja2] | Need for trained personnel and quality assurance [^114mLZvU] |
| Reduced laboratory workload [^115uxoFU] | Supply chain and maintenance logistics [^116WFqXP] |
| Improved patient satisfaction and adherence [^notfound] | Limited access in remote or resource-limited settings [^1172Hm3a] |

---

## WHO recommendations and guidelines

WHO **strongly recommends **Xpert MTB/RIF and Xpert Ultra as initial diagnostic tests for all presumptive TB cases, including those with HIV infection and extrapulmonary disease [^111XyQsn] [^113byug6]. It also advises expansion of molecular testing to include second-line drug resistance detection (e.g. Xpert MTB/XDR) to guide appropriate therapy selection [^115jgGsM].

---

## Implementation considerations

Successful deployment of on-site molecular testing requires **addressing operational challenges**:

- **Infrastructure**: Establishing reliable electricity, climate control, and secure storage for cartridges and reagents [^notfound].

- **Training**: Comprehensive training for healthcare workers on specimen collection, test operation, and result interpretation [^116jTHbY].

- **Quality assurance**: Robust quality control systems, regular proficiency testing, and external quality assessment [^1141WkBt].

- **Integration**: Embedding molecular testing into existing healthcare systems with clear algorithms for result action and patient management [^116WFqXP].

---

## Cost-effectiveness

Despite higher initial costs than smear microscopy, on-site molecular testing is **cost-effective** in high-burden settings due to reduced transmission, earlier treatment initiation, and improved patient outcomes [^113fMykr]. Funding from international donors and national governments has facilitated widespread adoption [^notfound].

---

## Future directions and emerging technologies

Emerging technologies such as CRISPR-based assays [^112RTkj6], targeted next-generation sequencing (tNGS) [^112AmSi8], and circulating free DNA (cfDNA) testing [^114gs9Wf] offer **promise for further improving **TB diagnostics. These technologies aim to enhance sensitivity, expand drug resistance detection, and enable testing in non-sputum samples, potentially transforming TB diagnosis and management [^1113TirU].

---

On-site DNA-based molecular testing for TB, particularly with Xpert MTB/RIF, provides **rapid, accurate diagnosis** and rifampin resistance detection, enabling timely treatment initiation and significantly improving patient outcomes. Despite operational challenges, WHO-endorsed scale-up is justified by substantial benefits in early case detection, transmission reduction, and mortality reduction.

The study XACT-2 was published by Aliasgar Esmail and colleagues in 2023 in the journal Nat Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Pulmonary tuberculosis. In the XACT-2 study, the trial question was: is on-site DNA-based molecular testing superior to same-day smear microscopy in patients with at least one tuberculosis symptom? In the XACT-2 study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the XACT-2 study, the population was: 584 patients (381 female, 203 male). The inclusion criteria were adult patients with at least one tuberculosis symptom for ≥ 2 weeks or with HIV infection. The key exclusion criteria were attended a tuberculosis clinic for their symptoms; receipt of tuberculosis treatment. In the XACT-2 study, the interventions were: n = 288 GeneXpert testing (on-site DNA-based molecular testing) n = 296 smear microscopy (use of conventional point-of-care smear microscopy). In the XACT-2 study, the primary outcome was: significant decrease in median time to initiation of tuberculosis treatment (8 days vs. 41 days; AD -33 days, 95% CI -53.88 to -12.12). In the XACT-2 study, the secondary outcomes were: significant decrease in median time to treatment of probably infectious patients (7 days vs. 24 days; AD -17 days, 95% CI -31.34 to -2.66) Significant increase in the rate of culture-positive patients initiating treatment within 60 days of testing (50% vs. 23%; RR 2, 95% CI 1 to 4.3) Significant increase in proportion of potentially infectious patients detected (94.1% vs. 23.5%; RR 3.4, 95% CI 1.6 to 7.2). In the XACT-2 study, the conclusion was: in adult patients with at least one tuberculosis symptom for ≥ 2 weeks or with HIV infection, GeneXpert testing was superior to smear microscopy with respect to median time to initiation of tuberculosis treatment.

### Multicomponent strategy with decentralized molecular testing for tuberculosis [^113fMykr]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2021). Excellent credibility.

Background

Effective strategies are needed to facilitate the prompt diagnosis and treatment of tuberculosis in countries with a high burden of the disease.

Methods

We conducted a cluster-randomized trial in which Ugandan community health centers were assigned to a multicomponent diagnostic strategy (on-site molecular testing for tuberculosis, guided restructuring of clinic workflows, and monthly feedback of quality metrics) or routine care (on-site sputum-smear microscopy and referral-based molecular testing). The primary outcome was the number of adults treated for confirmed tuberculosis within 14 days after presenting to the health center for evaluation during the 16-month intervention period. Secondary outcomes included completion of tuberculosis testing, same-day diagnosis, and same-day treatment. Outcomes were also assessed on the basis of proportions.

Results

A total of 20 health centers underwent randomization, with 10 assigned to each group. Of 10,644 eligible adults (median age, 40 years) whose data were evaluated, 60.1% were women and 43.8% had human immunodeficiency virus infection. The intervention strategy led to a greater number of patients being treated for confirmed tuberculosis within 14 days after presentation (342 patients across 10 intervention health centers vs. 220 across 10 control health centers; adjusted rate ratio, 1.56; 95% confidence interval, 1.21 to 2.01). More patients at intervention centers than at control centers completed tuberculosis testing (adjusted rate ratio, 1.85; 95% CI, 1.21 to 2.82), received a same-day diagnosis (adjusted rate ratio, 1.89; 95% CI, 1.39 to 2.56), and received same-day treatment for confirmed tuberculosis (adjusted rate ratio, 2.38; 95% CI, 1.57 to 3.61). Among 706 patients with confirmed tuberculosis, a higher proportion in the intervention group than in the control group were treated on the same day (adjusted rate ratio, 2.29; 95% CI, 1.23 to 4.25) or within 14 days after presentation (adjusted rate ratio, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.06 to 1.40).

Conclusions

A multicomponent diagnostic strategy that included on-site molecular testing plus implementation supports to address barriers to delivery of high-quality tuberculosis evaluation services led to greater numbers of patients being tested, receiving a diagnosis, and being treated for confirmed tuberculosis.

### Guidance for studies evaluating the accuracy of rapid tuberculosis drug-susceptibility tests [^114G7ZRG]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

The development and implementation of rapid molecular diagnostics for tuberculosis (TB) drug-susceptibility testing is critical to inform treatment of patients and to prevent the emergence and spread of resistance. Optimal trial planning for existing tests and those in development will be critical to rapidly gather the evidence necessary to inform World Health Organization review and to support potential policy recommendations. The evidence necessary includes an assessment of the performance for TB and resistance detection as well as an assessment of the operational characteristics of these platforms. The performance assessment should include analytical studies to confirm the limit of detection and assay ability to detect mutations conferring resistance across globally representative strains. The analytical evaluation is typically followed by multisite clinical evaluation studies to confirm diagnostic performance in sites and populations of intended use. This paper summarizes the considerations for the design of these analytical and clinical studies.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for pulmonary tuberculosis, more specifically with respect to nucleic acid amplification testing, initial testing, ATS/CDC/IDSA 2017 guidelines recommend to obtain rapid molecular drug susceptibility testing for rifampin, with or without isoniazid, on the respiratory specimens obtained from AFB smear- or NAAT (Hologic)-positive patients meeting one of the following criteria:

- have been treated for tuberculosis in the past

- were born in or have lived for at least 1 year in a foreign country with at least a moderate tuberculosis incidence (≥ 20 per 100, 000) or a high primary MDR-TB prevalence (≥ 2%)

- are contacts of patients with MDR-TB

- are HIV-infected.

### Which new diagnostics for tuberculosis, and when? [^116D4qaZ]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Recently, new diagnostic tools for tuberculosis detection and resistance testing have become available. The World Health Organization endorses new tuberculosis diagnostics by using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) process. This endorsement process takes place when limited evidence beyond test accuracy is available. There is a need to provide guidance to tuberculosis programs about which new diagnostics to scale up and how best to position them in diagnostic algorithms. To speed adoption of new diagnostics for tuberculosis, the policy recommendation process should be revised to consist of 2 steps: technical recommendation and programmatic recommendation. Technical recommendation would follow the GRADE process and be based on accuracy with limited cost and feasibility data, while programmatic recommendation would include patient-important outcomes, cost-effectiveness when implemented under routine conditions, and factors critical to successful scale-up. The evidence for both steps should be systematically collected, but each requires different study designs.

### Advances in molecular diagnosis of tuberculosis [^114TRorm]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Molecular tests for tuberculosis (TB) have the potential to help reach the three million people with TB who are undiagnosed or not reported each year and to improve the quality of care TB patients receive by providing accurate, quick results, including rapid drug-susceptibility testing. The World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended the use of molecular nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) tests for TB detection instead of smear microscopy, as they are able to detect TB more accurately, particularly in patients with paucibacillary disease and in people living with HIV. Importantly, some of these WHO-endorsed tests can detect mycobacterial gene mutations associated with anti-TB drug resistance, allowing clinicians to tailor effective TB treatment. Currently, a wide array of molecular tests for TB detection is being developed and evaluated, and while some tests are intended for reference laboratory use, others are being aimed at the point-of-care and peripheral health care settings. Notably, there is an emergence of molecular tests designed, manufactured, and rolled out in countries with high TB burden, of which some are explicitly aimed for near-patient placement. These developments should increase access to molecular TB testing for larger patient populations. With respect to drug susceptibility testing, NAATs and next-generation sequencing can provide results substantially faster than traditional phenotypic culture. Here, we review recent advances and developments in molecular tests for detecting TB as well as anti-TB drug resistance.

However, carry-over contamination is still possible with these assays, and quality assurance is critical. Additionally, the costs for each of these tests have not been made public, and no subsidized or concessional pricing schemes are yet in place. These tests do run on multidisease platforms, which adds value, but it is unclear exactly who will be willing to pay to implement these tests if they can only perform DST for INH and RIF resistance, particularly when there are simpler NAATs available (Table 1). Furthermore, their centralized placement means they are unavailable where patients first present to care, and therefore, sample transportation is essential for success. Reliable systems for delivering test results to patients and health care providers must also be in place for these tests to have impact.

Next-generation sequencing.

Next-generation sequencing (NGS) is increasingly considered a promising option for comprehensive DST for TB and produces results much faster than traditional phenotypic culture or culture-based testing. Unlike probe-based assays where detection is limited to probe-specific targets, NGS-based assays can provide detailed and accurate sequence information for whole genomes, as with whole-genome sequencing (WGS), or multiple gene regions of interest, as with targeted NGS. (Table 3).

TABLE 3
Strengths and limitations of WGS versus targeted sequencing via next-generation sequencing

Acknowledging the value of NGS, WHO has published guidance on the role of sequencing for detecting mutations associated with drug resistance in TB, along with a consensus-based TPP for sequencing. In 2019, a TB sequencing database called ReSeqTB was established at WHO to curate, standardize, and unify genotypic and phenotypic DST data, along with metadata on drug-resistant TB (DR-TB).

### Official American Thoracic Society / Infectious Diseases Society of America / centers for disease control and prevention clinical practice guidelines: diagnosis of tuberculosis in adults and children [^1175seHH]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Medium credibility.

ATS/IDSA/CDC tuberculosis diagnosis — nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) for suspected extrapulmonary tuberculosis: We suggest that NAAT be performed, rather than not performed, on specimens collected from sites of suspected extrapulmonary TB (conditional recommendation, very low-quality evidence). NAAT on pleural fluid and cerebrospinal fluid has a sensitivity of 56% and 62%, with false-negative rates of 44% and 38%, and specificity 98% for both, indicating that only about 2% of positive results are false-positives; across other body fluids and tissues, the sensitivity was usually < 90%, while the specificity was > 95%. Remarks state that a positive NAAT result can be used as evidence of extrapulmonary TB and guide decision making, whereas a negative NAAT result may not be used to exclude TB because false-negative results are exceedingly common. Rationale notes that mycobacterial culture results require at least 1–2 weeks, but NAAT can be performed within hours, and that if a positive NAAT result is considered adequate to confirm extrapulmonary TB, but a negative NAAT result is not used to exclude extrapulmonary TB, then the risks associated with false results are minimal. Cautions include that at this time there are no FDA-approved NAATs for use with extrapulmonary specimens.

### WHO consolidated guidelines on tuberculosis: module 3: diagnosis-rapid diagnostics for tuberculosis detection [^117SLqDR]. Geneva: World Health Organization (2021). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for pulmonary tuberculosis, more specifically with respect to nucleic acid amplification testing, initial testing, WHO 2021 guidelines recommend to consider obtaining Xpert Ultra rather than smear microscopy/culture and phenotypic drug susceptibility testing as an initial diagnostic test for tuberculosis and for rifampin resistance detection in sputum in adult patients with signs and symptoms of pulmonary tuberculosis with a prior history of tuberculosis and an end of treatment within the last 5 years.

### Comparison of two diagnostic intervention packages for community-based active case finding for tuberculosis: an open-label randomized controlled trial [^112qWwx6]. Nature Medicine (2023). Excellent credibility.

Two in every five patients with active tuberculosis (TB) remain undiagnosed or unreported. Therefore community-based, active case-finding strategies require urgent implementation. However, whether point-of-care (POC), portable battery-operated, molecular diagnostic tools deployed at a community level, compared with conventionally used POC smear microscopy, can shorten time-to-treatment initiation, thus potentially curtailing transmission, remains unclear. To clarify this issue, we performed an open-label, randomized controlled trial in periurban informal settlements of Cape Town, South Africa, where we TB symptom screened 5,274 individuals using a community-based scalable mobile clinic. Some 584 individuals with HIV infection or symptoms of TB underwent targeted diagnostic screening and were randomized (1:1) to same-day smear microscopy (n = 296) or on-site DNA-based molecular diagnosis (n = 288; GeneXpert). The primary aim was to compare time to TB treatment initiation between the arms. Secondary aims included feasibility and detection of probably infectious people. Of participants who underwent targeted screening, 9.9% (58 of 584) had culture-confirmed TB. Time-to-treatment initiation occurred significantly earlier in the Xpert versus the smear-microscopy arm (8 versus 41d, P = 0.002). However, overall, Xpert detected only 52% of individuals with culture-positive TB. Notably, Xpert detected almost all of the probably infectious patients compared with smear microscopy (94.1% versus 23.5%, P = < 0.001). Xpert was associated with a shorter median time to treatment of probably infectious patients (7 versus 24d, P = 0.02) and a greater proportion of infectious patients were on treatment at 60d compared with the probably noninfectious patients (76.5% versus 38.2%, P < 0.01). Overall, a greater proportion of POC Xpert-positive participants were on treatment at 60d compared with all culture-positive participants (100% versus 46.5%, P < 0.01). These findings challenge the traditional paradigm of a passive case-finding, public health strategy and argues for the implementation of portable DNA-based diagnosis with linkage to care as a community-oriented, transmission-interruption strategy. The study was registered with the South African National Clinical Trials Registry (application ID 4367; DOH-27–0317–5367) and ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03168945).

### Clinical implications of molecular drug resistance testing for Mycobacterium tuberculosis: a 2023 TBnet / RESIST-TB consensus statement [^116JK43R]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

Drug-resistant tuberculosis is a substantial health-care concern worldwide. Despite culture-based methods being considered the gold standard for drug susceptibility testing, molecular methods provide rapid information about the Mycobacterium tuberculosis mutations associated with resistance to anti-tuberculosis drugs. This consensus document was developed on the basis of a comprehensive literature search, by the TBnet and RESIST-TB networks, about reporting standards for the clinical use of molecular drug susceptibility testing. Review and the search for evidence included hand-searching journals and searching electronic databases. The panel identified studies that linked mutations in genomic regions of M tuberculosis with treatment outcome data. Implementation of molecular testing for the prediction of drug resistance in M tuberculosis is key. Detection of mutations in clinical isolates has implications for the clinical management of patients with multidrug-resistant or rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis, especially in situations when phenotypic drug susceptibility testing is not available. A multidisciplinary team including clinicians, microbiologists, and laboratory scientists reached a consensus on key questions relevant to molecular prediction of drug susceptibility or resistance to M tuberculosis, and their implications for clinical practice. This consensus document should help clinicians in the management of patients with tuberculosis, providing guidance for the design of treatment regimens and optimising outcomes.

Nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT) for pulmonary tuberculosis — cautions and limitations indicate that NAAT cannot be used to exclude pulmonary TB and, when clinical suspicion is low, NAAT is generally not performed because false-positive results are unacceptably frequent; laboratory-based diagnostic tests are not a replacement for clinical judgment and a diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis can be made without laboratory confirmation, especially in children; there appears to be little increase in accuracy by routinely performing NAAT on multiple specimens rather than on a single specimen, though some clinicians may find it beneficial in case-specific situations; if inhibitors are detected, collection of a new specimen for NAAT should be considered; if in-house tests are to be used, they should be validated and shown to have analytical performance accuracy comparable to or better than that of commercial tests.

### Biomarkers and diagnostics for tuberculosis: progress, needs, and translation into practice [^111565XH]. Lancet (2010). Excellent credibility.

Human infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis can progress to active disease, be contained as latent infection, or be eradicated by the host response. Tuberculosis diagnostics classify a patient into one of these categories. These are not fixed distinct states, but rather are continua along which patients can move, and are affected by HIV infection, immunosuppressive therapies, antituberculosis treatments, and other poorly understood factors. Tuberculosis biomarkers-host or pathogen-specific-provide prognostic information, either for individual patients or study cohorts, about these outcomes. Tuberculosis case detection remains difficult, partly because of inaccurate diagnostic methods. Investments have yielded some progress in development of new diagnostics, although the existing pipeline is limited for tests for sputum-smear-negative cases, childhood tuberculosis, and accurate prediction of reactivation of latent tuberculosis. Despite new, sensitive, automated molecular platforms for detection of tuberculosis and drug resistance, a simple, inexpensive point-of-care test is still not available. The effect of any new tests will depend on the method and extent of their introduction, the strength of the laboratories, and the degree to which access to appropriate therapy follows access to diagnosis. Translation of scientific progress in biomarkers and diagnostics into clinical and public health programmes is possible-with political commitment, increased funding, and engagement of all stakeholders.

Genotyping of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) — Recommendation 20 states: We recommend one culture isolate from each mycobacterial culture–positive patient be submitted to a regional genotyping laboratory for genotyping (strong recommendation, very low-quality evidence). The guideline notes that We identified no empirical evidence that estimated the frequency with which the availability of genotyped isolates changed public health practices or affected patient outcomes, and Therefore, the recommendation is based upon the committee's collective clinical experience, which constitutes very low-quality evidence. Rationale includes that genotyping is useful in detecting false-positive results due to confirming laboratory cross-contamination, investigating outbreaks of TB, evaluating contact investigations, determining whether new episodes are due to reinfection or reactivation, and elucidating sites and patterns of Mtb transmission within communities; this information is used by state and local tuberculosis control programs to focus interventions to interrupt further TB transmission and poses no risk to individual patients. The document adds that in response to nosocomial outbreaks and tuberculosis among HIV-infected patients, the CDC established a national universal tuberculosis genotyping system for the United States, and that the recommendation is strong because the committee felt certain that the public health benefits of genotyping far outweigh the modest costs and burdens of genotyping, even though the evidence can provide very little confidence in the magnitude of the benefits, costs, and burdens.

### Impact of a multicomponent strategy including decentralized molecular testing for tuberculosis on mortality: planned analysis of a cluster-randomized trial in Uganda [^115v47NF]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Tuberculosis (TB) remains a leading cause of infectious disease death worldwide, with an estimated 1.3 million deaths due to TB in 2022. Rapid diagnosis followed by prompt treatment initiation is important for reducing morbidity and community transmission. To achieve these goals, the World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended rapid molecular tests such as Xpert MTB/RIF (Xpert) (Cepheid, Inc. Sunnyvale, California) as the first-line test for all people exhibiting signs and symptoms of TB since 2013 and has called for universal access to molecular testing. Molecular tests can provide results within 2 h and can detect both the presence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and resistance to rifampicin, a key first-line anti-TB drug, helping to ensure patients initiate appropriate treatment. However, the impact of rapid molecular testing on mortality of people undergoing evaluation for TB remains unclear.

Nine previous studies have found inconclusive mortality reductions with Xpert testing in comparison to sputum smear microscopy. Meta-analyses of previous trials have also not conclusively demonstrated that rapid molecular testing reduces mortality. However, previous trials had key limitations including insufficient sample size and study design features that could bias results toward the null. Previous trials included procedures such as chest x-ray, sputum culture, and additional contact with patients that would not have otherwise occurred as part of routine care, potentially leading to more patients being tested and treated for TB.

To address many of the limitations described above, we conducted a highly pragmatic cluster-randomized trial in Uganda of a multicomponent strategy including decentralized Xpert testing in comparison to routine care (on-site smear microscopy plus referral-based Xpert testing for selected patients). Key pragmatic features of the trial included unbiased recruitment of persons with possible TB and reliance on routine clinicians to conduct all testing and treatment. Additional procedures that might increase empiric treatment, such as chest x-ray, were not incorporated, and there were no attempts to reduce loss to follow-up by adding culture testing or scheduled contact with study participants. The intervention strategy included setting up workflows to enable same-day treatment to mitigate pre-treatment loss to follow-up and performance feedback to improve the quality of care.

### Can the geneXpert MTB / XDR deliver on the promise of expanded, near-patient tuberculosis drug-susceptibility testing? [^1113SQwH]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2022). High credibility.

Early diagnosis, including universal drug-susceptibility testing for all patients with tuberculosis, remains a key priority for tuberculosis elimination by 2035. The drug-resistant tuberculosis care cascade remains persistently challenged by substantial gaps in timely diagnosis and treatment of drug-resistant tuberculosis. Current diagnostics for drug-resistant tuberculosis are limited with respect to accuracy, time to results, affordability, suitability for resource-poor endemic settings, and accessibility for use at the point of care. WHO endorsement of the novel Xpert MTB/XDR assay holds notable promise for expanding access to testing and rapid diagnosis of tuberculosis drug resistance. The Xpert MTB/XDR assay detects resistance to isoniazid, ethionamide, fluoroquinolones, and second-line injectables, and is indicated for testing in patients with confirmed pulmonary tuberculosis. However, this iteration of the Xpert MTB/XDR cartridge might have less of an effect than expected, as WHO has since downgraded the role of second-line injectable agents in treating drug-resistant tuberculosis, and has revised case definitions of drug-resistant tuberculosis to incorporate resistance to new drugs. This Personal View explores the strengths and limitations of the Xpert MTB/XDR assay in the detection of drug resistance, the assay's ability to inform appropriate drug-resistant tuberculosis drug selection, and the optimal placement of the Xpert XDR assay in the laboratory diagnostic workflow.

### Toward the development of a circulating free DNA-basedDiagnostic test for infectious diseases: a review of evidence for tuberculosis [^116HH1dm]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2019). Medium credibility.

To the best of our knowledge, no cfDNA assays for infectious diseases based on PCR or isothermal amplification, which integrate sample pretreatment, are currently available. Many of the existing nucleic acid tests (NATs) for infectious diseases, which use PCR or isothermal amplification, use a concentration of the pathogen, cell or viral lysis, and an extraction of the genomic material followed by amplification. NATs for cfDNA have different requirements for sample preparation. The main differences include (i) no infectious agent enrichment or cell lysis, (ii) emphasis on enrichment of short DNA fragments instead of genomic DNA, and (iii) amplification of short amplicons.

In summary, the field of cfDNA as a TB biomarker is still in its infancy; however, its high potential is driving more attention to this area. Most papers about this topic were published in the last 3 years and more promising results are expected in the near future. Once cfDNA is validated as a TB biomarker with sufficient performance for diagnosis, more efforts need to be directed toward the development of an affordable platform ideally able to detect this infectious disease at the point of care.

### GenoTypeMTBDRsl assay for resistance to second-line anti-tuberculosis drugs [^111oUj8s]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Genotype® MTBDRsl (MTBDRsl) is a rapid DNA-based test for detecting specific mutations associated with resistance to fluoroquinolones and second-line injectable drugs (SLIDs) in Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex. MTBDRsl version 2.0 (released in 2015) identifies the mutations detected by version 1.0, as well as additional mutations. The test may be performed on a culture isolate or a patient specimen, which eliminates delays associated with culture. Version 1.0 requires a smear-positive specimen, while version 2.0 may use a smear-positive or -negative specimen. We performed this updated review as part of a World Health Organization process to develop updated guidelines for using MTBDRsl.

Objectives

To assess and compare the diagnostic accuracy of MTBDRsl for: 1. fluoroquinolone resistance, 2. SLID resistance, and 3. extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis, indirectly on a M. tuberculosis isolate grown from culture or directly on a patient specimen. Participants were people with rifampicin-resistant or multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. The role of MTBDRsl would be as the initial test, replacing culture-based drug susceptibility testing (DST), for detecting second-line drug resistance.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases without language restrictions up to 21 September 2015: the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register; MEDLINE; Embase OVID; Science Citation Index Expanded, Conference Proceedings Citation Index-Science, and BIOSIS Previews (all three from Web of Science); LILACS; and SCOPUS; registers for ongoing trials; and ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I. We reviewed references from included studies and contacted specialists in the field.

Selection Criteria

We included cross-sectional and case-control studies that determined MTBDRsl accuracy against a defined reference standard (culture-based DST, genetic sequencing, or both).

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed quality using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2) tool. We synthesized data for versions 1.0 and 2.0 separately. We estimated MTBDRsl sensitivity and specificity for fluoroquinolone resistance, SLID resistance, and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis when the test was performed indirectly or directly (smear-positive specimen for version 1.0, smear-positive or -negative specimen for version 2.0). We explored the influence on accuracy estimates of individual drugs within a drug class and of different reference standards. We performed most analyses using a bivariate random-effects model with culture-based DST as reference standard.

Main Results

We included 27 studies. Twenty-six studies evaluated version 1.0, and one study version 2.0. Of 26 studies stating specimen country origin, 15 studies (58%) evaluated patients from low- or middle-income countries. Overall, we considered the studies to be of high methodological quality. However, only three studies (11%) had low risk of bias for the reference standard; these studies used World Health Organization (WHO)-recommended critical concentrations for all drugs in the culture-based DST reference standard. MTBDRsl version 1.0 Fluoroquinolone resistance: indirect testing, MTBDRsl pooled sensitivity and specificity (95% confidence interval (CI)) were 85.6% (79.2% to 90.4%) and 98.5% (95.7% to 99.5%), (19 studies, 2223 participants); direct testing (smear-positive specimen), pooled sensitivity and specificity were 86.2% (74.6% to 93.0%) and 98.6% (96.9% to 99.4%), (nine studies, 1771 participants, moderate quality evidence). SLID resistance: indirect testing, MTBDRsl pooled sensitivity and specificity were 76.5% (63.3% to 86.0%) and 99.1% (97.3% to 99.7%), (16 studies, 1921 participants); direct testing (smear-positive specimen), pooled sensitivity and specificity were 87.0% (38.1% to 98.6%) and 99.5% (93.6% to 100.0%), (eight studies, 1639 participants, low quality evidence). Extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis: indirect testing, MTBDRsl pooled sensitivity and specificity were 70.9% (42.9% to 88.8%) and 98.8% (96.1% to 99.6%), (eight studies, 880 participants); direct testing (smear-positive specimen), pooled sensitivity and specificity were 69.4% (38.8% to 89.0%) and 99.4% (95.0% to 99.3%), (six studies, 1420 participants, low quality evidence). Similar to the original Cochrane review, we found no evidence of a significant difference in MTBDRsl version 1.0 accuracy between indirect and direct testing for fluoroquinolone resistance, SLID resistance, and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis. MTBDRsl version 2.0 Fluoroquinolone resistance: direct testing, MTBDRsl sensitivity and specificity were 97% (83% to 100%) and 98% (93% to 100%), smear-positive specimen; 80% (28% to 99%) and 100% (40% to 100%), smear-negative specimen. SLID resistance: direct testing, MTBDRsl sensitivity and specificity were 89% (72% to 98%) and 90% (84% to 95%), smear-positive specimen; 80% (28% to 99%) and 100% (40% to 100%), smear-negative specimen. Extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis: direct testing, MTBDRsl sensitivity and specificity were 79% (49% to 95%) and 97% (93% to 99%), smear-positive specimen; 50% (1% to 99%) and 100% (59% to 100%), smear-negative specimen. We had insufficient data to estimate summary sensitivity and specificity of version 2.0 (smear-positive and -negative specimens) or to compare accuracy of the two versions. A limitation was that most included studies did not consistently use the World Health Organization (WHO)-recommended concentrations for drugs in the culture-based DST reference standard.

Authors' Conclusions

In people with rifampicin-resistant or multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, MTBDRsl performed on a culture isolate or smear-positive specimen may be useful in detecting second-line drug resistance. MTBDRsl (smear-positive specimen) correctly classified around six in seven people as having fluoroquinolone or SLID resistance, although the sensitivity estimates for SLID resistance varied. The test rarely gave a positive result for people without drug resistance. However, when second-line drug resistance is not detected (MTBDRsl result is negative), conventional DST can still be used to evaluate patients for resistance to the fluoroquinolones or SLIDs. We recommend that future work evaluate MTBDRsl version 2.0, in particular on smear-negative specimens and in different settings to account for different resistance-causing mutations that may vary by strain. Researchers should also consider incorporating WHO-recommended critical concentrations into their culture-based reference standards.

### Reimagining the research approach to tuberculosis [^11484YnZ]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2018). Low credibility.

DIAGNOSTICS

The GeneXpert MTB/rifampicin resistant diagnostic (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA) has been a welcome addition to the TB diagnostic armamentarium. However, there is still a need for improved and transformative TB diagnostics to overcome the severe limitations of antiquated, nonstandardized, and imprecise techniques which are used presently in most settings. In addition, the application of twenty first century diagnostic technologies that can detect Mtb in a variety of clinical specimens from multiple body sites in addition to sputum, as well as advanced approaches for monitoring and predicting treatment outcomes are a priority. If we can detect a single copy of HIV RNA in the blood of an HIV-infected individual and track disease progression with viral load testing, we should be able to develop a comparable diagnostic and disease monitoring capability for TB, as far-fetched as this might seem at present.

The diagnosis of TB in coinfected individuals is complicated because extrapulmonary and paucibacillary pulmonary disease is more common with HIV infection, and these forms of the disease require greater test sensitivity. Yet, TB diagnosis is still focused predominantly on sputum specimens, which can be difficult to obtain in HIV-infected people, particularly children. For all TB patients, there is a critical need for rapid, inexpensive, and accurate "point-of-care" molecular diagnostics that can rapidly differentiate between drug-sensitive and drug-resistant forms of Mtb, such that appropriate drug regimens can be prescribed, based on the molecular profile of the pathogen. Although an extensive data bank of genomic sequences from numerous Mtb strains is available, additional basic research is needed on gene mutations resulting in drug resistance to help inform treatment decisions.

### Implementation strategies to increase the uptake and impact of molecular WHO-recommended rapid diagnostic tests: evidence from a mixed-methods systematic review [^116WFqXP]. BMJ Global Health (2025). High credibility.

Background

Tuberculosis remains one of the leading global causes of death from a single infectious agent. In 2022, an estimated 10.6 million people became sick with tuberculosis and 1.3 million people died due to tuberculosis. Analyses of the tuberculosis (TB) cascade of care demonstrate losses to follow-up at each step of a patient's care journey, but diagnosis consistently represents the largest point of systemic failure. The impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic widened this diagnostic gap. The same year, 3.1 million people were estimated to develop TB disease but were not notified to national health systems; most of the missing people were presumed to be undiagnosed. Missed and delayed diagnoses increase individual disease severity and transmission.

The WHO first recommended molecular WHO-recommended rapid diagnostic tests (mWRDs) to diagnose TB and detect drug resistance to rifampicin in 2011. Between 2011 and the present, WHO guidelines have evolved from recommending that mWRDs be prioritised for people living with HIV and people at high risk of developing drug-resistant TB to recommending that mWRDs be undertaken as the initial test for all persons being evaluated for TB. However, the implementation, use and scale-up of mWRD testing remains limited. In 2022, despite the WHO recommendations and increased availability of these tests, only 47% of people newly diagnosed with TB were tested with an mWRD as their initial diagnostic test.

Patient pathway analyses demonstrate that people with TB encounter circuitous care pathways, highlighting many missed opportunities for diagnosis and engagement in care. There is increasing recognition that diagnostic tests only improve patient outcomes if they are available to and valued by health workers, who then implement the test, interpret results correctly and engage people in care. Implementation barriers affecting mWRD use and scale-up vary according to clinical and country setting and have been described in a previous qualitative evidence synthesis by Engel et al. These barriers include insufficient test availability and infrastructure, inadequate healthcare provider training and capacity, as well as limited national and local-level agency in policy decision-making. Conversely, implementation enablers include expanding diagnostic algorithms and optimising sample transport. Implementation strategies to improve the use of mWRDs have not been systematically evaluated.

### Diagnosis of extra pulmonary tuberculosis: an update on novel diagnostic approaches [^111R1r4Q]. Respiratory Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Tuberculosis (TB) remains a major global public health problem worldwide. Though Pulmonary TB (PTB) is mostly discussed, one in five cases of TB present are extrapulmonary TB (EPTB) that manifests conspicuous diagnostic and management challenges with respect to the site of infection. The diagnosis of EPTB is often delayed or even missed due to insidious clinical presentation, pauci-bacillary nature of the disease, and lack of laboratory facilities in the resource limited settings. Culture, the classical gold standard for the diagnosis of tuberculosis, suffers from increased technical and logistical constraints in EPTB cases. Other than culture, several other tests are available but their feasibility and effciacy for the detection of EPTB is still the matter of interest. We need more specific and precise test/s for the various forms of EPTB diagnosis which can easily be applied in the routine TB control program is required. A test that can contribute remarkably towards improving EPTB case detection reducing the morbidity and mortality is the utmost requirement. In this review we described the scenario of molecular and other noval methods available for laboratory diagnosis of EPTB, and also discussed the challenges linked with each diagnostic method. This review will make the readers aware of new emerging diagnostic techniques in the field of EPTB diagnosis. They can make an informed decision to choose the appropriate one according to the test availability, their clinical settings and financial considerations.

TABLE 3
Research gaps for the development of a cfDNA-based IVD test related to preanalytical factors

Another challenging feature for the development of a cfDNA assay is integrating sample pretreatment and a detection technology within a single sample-to-answer device. The setting where the test is expected to be used, as well as the concentration of target cfDNA in the sample, will guide the selection of appropriate test platforms. Costly techniques, such as sequencing, digital PCR (dPCR), and mass spectrometry, mostly used in resource-rich contexts have to date limited applicability in low-resource settings, unless cost and complexity can be reduced substantially (as is expected for sequencing). More affordable technologies that are readily applicable and already in use in resource-limited settings, such as PCR, isothermal amplification, or line-probe assays, are better suited. Nucleic acid-detection techniques bypassing amplification and based on hybridization of sequence-specific probes (such as fluorescence in situ hybridization [FISH]) are probably unsuitable due to the low concentration of cfDNA in biological samples. Typical limits of detection of these platforms are 0.5 to 5 copies/µl for PCR and > 10 copies/reaction for isothermal amplification. New diagnostic techniques that are worth mentioning in this context are those based on clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) technology, such as specific high-sensitivity enzymatic reporter unlocking (SHERLOCK) and DNA endonuclease-targeted CRISPR trans reporter (DETECTR). They both use isothermal amplification and Cas-mediated collateral cleavage of a reporter RNA, allowing for detection of the target.

### Drug-resistant tuberculosis: advances in diagnosis and management [^113B4k7J]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

WHO has recommended the use of rapid molecular tests to diagnose MDR-TB since 2015. State- of-the-art molecular platforms screen for the presence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (Mtbc) DNA and resistance to rifampicin in a single assay. Xpert MTB/RIF (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) got a WHO endorsement in 2014. The assay revolutionized the time-to-result screening and confirmation of rifampicin-resistant TB. The following steps in the evolution of the molecular tests involved lowering the detection limit (Xpert MTB/ RIF Ultra) and evaluating additional resistance-associated genes, also improving TB diagnostics in children. Line probe assays to detect TB drug resistance are currently being replaced by gene arrays, respectively, next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based methods such as Deeplex Myc-TB (Genoscreen, Lille, France). Further, there is a broader offer of automated rapid real-time PCR assays for the direct detection of TB and drug resistance. Nevertheless, drug resistance to new and repurposed drugs threatens recent advances in DR- TB treatment and appropriate resistance testing to those drugs is widely unavailable. WHO and the Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics developed a set of target product profiles to guide the development of new TB diagnostic tools. The patient-focused approach should prompt for fast clinical evaluation and early laboratory diagnostic testing. All patients with TB should be risk- assessed for drug resistance based on epidemiological data and history. The diagnostic workup involves point-of-care molecular testing to screen for TB and rifampicin resistance. If rifampicin-resistant Mtbc is detected, add-on modular testing for first-line and second-line drugs are recommended. The new Xpert MTB/XDR screens for mutations leading to resistance to isoniazid, fluorquinolones, ethionamide and aminoglycosides and can offer a first, reliable assessment of the susceptibility profile of the infectious agent. On a global scale, confirmatory testing using mycobacterial liquid culture, bacterial identification and phenotypic drug-susceptibility testing (pDST) can be provided in national and supranational reference laboratories mainly. State-of-the-art pDST uses the WHO critical concentration drug proportion method, which can be performed in semiautomated instruments such as MGIT 960 (BD, Franklin Lakes, New Jersey, USA). Alternative testing methods using broth microdilution are being implemented in various supranational laboratories, which generate quantitative susceptibility profiles, especially for antibiotics that entered the therapeutic armamentarium only recently such as bedaquiline, delamanid and pretomanid.

### Transforming tuberculosis diagnosis with clinical metagenomics: progress and roadblocks [^1113TirU]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Tuberculosis (TB) remains a leading global infectious killer, yet traditional diagnostic methods are inadequate. Acid-fast staining suffers from low sensitivity, and mycobacterial culture requires prolonged incubation because of the slow growth of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. PCR-based molecular assays allow rapid detection, but their capacity for resistance profiling is limited to a narrow set of mutations. Metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) has emerged as a promising culture-independent tool for TB detection, enabling broad-spectrum pathogen identification and offering added value in complex scenarios including extra-pulmonary disease, mixed infections, and infections in immunocompromised or pediatric populations. Clinical studies indicate that mNGS achieves moderate to high sensitivity and excellent specificity in the diagnosis of tuberculosis. However, its diagnostic performance is often constrained by low mycobacterial read counts, interference from abundant host nucleic acids, and the inability to distinguish active from latent infection. In addition, the accuracy of drug resistance prediction using mNGS remains limited, and the World Health Organization currently endorses targeted NGS as the preferred sequencing-based approach for resistance profiling. Despite these challenges, mNGS has facilitated novel diagnostic strategies that combine pathogen detection with host-response data, thereby broadening its potential clinical utility. Nevertheless, practical barriers such as high cost, complex laboratory workflows, and difficulties in data interpretation continue to restrict widespread adoption in routine practice. Future efforts should prioritize technical optimization, standardized protocols, and integration with conventional diagnostics to establish cost-effective and clinically meaningful roles for mNGS in TB diagnosis and management.

### Target product profile of a molecular drug-susceptibility test for use in microscopy centers [^115ZdBvT]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Current phenotypic testing for drug resistance in patients with tuberculosis is inadequate primarily with respect to turnaround time. Molecular tests hold the promise of an improved time to diagnosis.

Methods

A target product profile for a molecular drug-susceptibility test (DST) was developed on the basis of a collaborative effort that included opinions gathered from researchers, clinicians, policy makers, and test developers on optimal clinical and operational characteristics in settings of intended use. In addition, the current diagnostic ecosystem and the diagnostic development landscape were mapped.

Results

Molecular DSTs for detecting tuberculosis in microscopy centers should ideally evaluate for resistance to rifampin, fluoroquinolones, isoniazid, and pyrazinamide and enable the selection of the most appropriate treatment regimen. Performance characteristics of DSTs need to be optimized, but compromises can be made that depend on the trade-off between a false-positive result and a false-negative result. The operational requirements of a test will vary depending on the site of implementation. However, the most-important considerations pertain to quality control, maintenance and calibration, and the ability to export data.

Conclusion

This target product profile defines the needs as perceived by the tuberculosis stakeholder community and attempts to provide a means of communication with test developers to ensure that fit-for-purpose DSTs are being developed.

Diagnostic tests for tuberculosis in the United States — The guideline notes that "In the United States, up to 80% of all initial TB-related laboratory work… is performed in hospitals, clinics, and independent laboratories outside the public health system, whereas > 50% of species identification and drug susceptibility testing (DST) is performed in public health laboratories". It specifies that "Seven types of tests for the diagnosis of TB disease and detection of drug resistance are performed within the tuberculosis laboratory system and recommended for optimal TB control services (Table 2)". For rapid case confirmation, "Both sputum smears for AFB and nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) should be available with rapid turnaround times from specimen collection".

### Impact of the xpert MTB / RIF diagnostic test for tuberculosis in countries with a high burden of disease [^114Mwncp]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Control of tuberculosis necessitates prompt diagnosis and access to effective treatment. We discuss the impact of a new nucleic acid amplification test to assist diagnosis and detect rifampicin resistance. Following encouraging clinical performance studies, an automated PCR-based test, the Xpert MTB/RIF (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA), has been implemented on a global scale. Clinical trials to assess the impact of the new technology in primary healthcare clinics have been undertaken in tuberculosis (TB) endemic countries.

Recent Findings

Clinical trials at the point of care in TB endemic countries demonstrated that increased numbers of TB patients are identified using the Xpert MTB/RIF assay as the frontline diagnostic test in place of sputum smear microscopy. Decreased times from sample collection to initiation of treatment were also reported when using the molecular test. However, overall case notification rates did not improve, and no significant impact on patient outcome (morbidity or mortality) was reported.

Summary

Sensitive molecular tests to assist diagnosis of tuberculosis may provide a faster diagnostic result when used in clinics and laboratories, but the limited impact on patient outcomes suggests additional interventions are needed to enhance TB control.

### Targeted next-generation sequencing for drug-resistant tuberculosis diagnosis: implementation considerations for bacterial load, regimen selection and diagnostic algorithm placement [^114pSfvk]. BMJ Global Health (2025). High credibility.

Despite this progress, challenges remain in translating the utility of tNGS into clinical practice. Guidance is needed on how to optimally integrate tNGS into existing diagnostic algorithms, considering its technical and operational challenges, particularly in resource-limited settings. The Seq&Treat study provided a robust evaluation of these two tNGS solutions, demonstrating their diagnostic accuracy across high-burden settings. However, that evaluation focused on performance metrics and diagnostic accuracy, leaving questions about how actionable tNGS results can enhance patient care and fit within broader diagnostic workflows.

Building on Seq&Treat findings, we analyse key factors influencing the successful adoption of tNGS, including integration with existing WHO-recommended molecular tests, its role in informing treatment regimens and its applicability across diverse settings. We propose diagnostic algorithms incorporating tNGS solutions to optimise DR-TB detection and treatment, aiming to address the gaps in operational guidance and policy for effective implementation in global TB control programmes.

### Official American Thoracic Society / Infectious Diseases Society of America / centers for disease control and prevention clinical practice guidelines: diagnosis of tuberculosis in adults and children [^1122aqf1]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Medium credibility.

Rapid molecular drug susceptibility testing (DST) — indications and accuracy: Rapid molecular DST is recommended only for subgroups in which drug resistance is more likely; examples include NAAT or AFB smear positive patients who have been treated for tuberculosis, were born in or have lived for at least 1 year in a foreign country with at least a moderate tuberculosis incidence (≥ 20 per 100 000) or a high primary MDR-TB prevalence (≥ 2%), are contacts of patients with MDR-TB, or are HIV infected. For rifampin resistance, the sensitivity and specificity are both > 97%, with false-positive and false-negative results < 3% of the time; for isoniazid resistance, sensitivity and specificity are estimated to be 90% and 99%, with false-positive and false-negative results roughly 1% and 10% of the time, respectively, and rapid molecular DST can be used to confirm isoniazid resistance in respiratory specimens, but not exclude it. The recommendation is strong because the moderate-quality evidence supported that benefits of rapid molecular DST outweighed costs in patients at increased risk for drug resistance.

### Toward the development of a circulating free DNA-basedDiagnostic test for infectious diseases: a review of evidence for tuberculosis [^114gs9Wf]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2019). Medium credibility.

The detection of circulating free DNA (cfDNA) has transformed the field of oncology and prenatal diagnostics. Clinical application of cfDNA for disease diagnosis and monitoring, however, is relatively recent in the field of infectious disease. The potential of cfDNA as a noninvasive diagnostic and monitoring tool is especially promising for tuberculosis (TB), as it enables the detection of both pulmonary and extrapulmonary TB from easily accessible urine and/or blood samples from any age group. However, despite the potential of cfDNA detection to identify TB, very few studies are described in the literature to date. A comprehensive search of the literature identified 15 studies that report detecting Mycobacterium tuberculosis DNA in the blood and urine of TB patients with nongenitourinary disease, but in only six of them were the methodological steps considered suitable for cfDNA isolation and detection. The sensitivities and specificities for the diagnosis of pulmonary and extrapulmonary TB cases reported in these six studies are highly variable, falling in the range of 29% to 79% and 67% to 100%, respectively. While most studies could not meet the performance requirements of the high-priority target product profiles (TPP) published by the World Health Organization (WHO), the study results nonetheless show promise for a point-of-care detection assay. Better designed prospective studies, using appropriate samples, will be required to validate cfDNA as a TB biomarker.

### Treatment of drug-resistant tuberculosis. An official ATS / CDC / ERS / IDSA clinical practice guideline [^111WkEwF]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Diagnosing tuberculosis and identifying drug resistance — Initial testing and risk stratification are emphasized: A rapid test for at least rifampin resistance should ideally be done for every patient, but especially for those at risk of drug resistance. Concern for resistance is heightened in patients from areas of the world with at least a moderate incidence of TB in general (≥ 20/100,000), and a high primary MDR-TB prevalence (> 2%). Individuals who have or recently had close contact with a patient with infectious DR-TB, especially when the contact is a young child or has HIV infection, are at risk of developing DR-TB. Molecular methods, and more recently whole-genome sequencing (WGS), are increasingly available and can provide information on resistance to all first-line and many second-line drugs. An aggressive effort is made to collect biological specimens for detection of M. tuberculosis and for drug resistance.

Rapid molecular DST — cautions and assay availability: Line probe and molecular beacon assays have not been sufficiently validated for use on specimens other than respiratory specimens, and based on available commercial kits only one is currently approved by the FDA — the molecular beacon–based method Xpert MTB/RIF. It is the only FDA-approved assay and it integrates diagnosis of TB and detection of rifampin resistance, and if this test is used for the diagnosis of TB, a rifampin resistance result is automatically provided regardless of patient risk.

### What is the outcome of targeted tuberculosis screening based on universal genotyping and location? [^11112s12]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Rationale and Objectives

Identifying and treating persons with latent tuberculosis (TB) infection (LTBI) at high risk for developing TB is part of the current TB elimination strategy. There are no specific criteria, other than medical risks, to designate groups as high risk for developing TB. We hypothesized that, if location-based screenings were done in communities where persons with genotypically clustered Mycobacterium tuberculosis resided, then persons with LTBI from recent transmission and with undiagnosed TB could be identified.

Methods

Location-based TB screenings were done in partnership with multiple community-based organizations using resources previously used for other types of screening.

Main Results

Location-based screenings identified one person with TB for every 83 screened, and one person with LTBI for every five screened. The yield of this targeted screening program for discovering persons with TB and LTBI exceeded what would be expected from nontargeted screening in a county with a TB incidence of 5.7 per 100,000 population.

Conclusions

Genotyping combined with geographic information systems analysis can potentially be used to define high-risk status and to define areas for location-based TB screenings.

### Guidance for studies evaluating the accuracy of biomarker-based nonsputum tests to diagnose tuberculosis [^1144vwEY]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

The World Health Organization's (WHO) "End TB" strategy calls for development and implementation of novel tuberculosis (TB) diagnostics. Sputum-based diagnostics are challenging to implement and often less sensitive in high-priority populations. Nonsputum, biomarker-based tests may facilitate TB testing at lower levels of the healthcare system, accelerate treatment initiation, and improve outcomes. We provide guidance on the design of diagnostic accuracy studies evaluating nonsputum, biomarker-based tests within the context of WHO's target product profile for such tests. Study designs should account for the intended use when choosing the study population, setting, and reference standards. Although adults with respiratory symptoms may be an initial target population, other high-priority populations regardless of symptoms-including people living with human immunodeficiency virus, those unable to produce sputum samples or with extrapulmonary TB, household contacts, and children-should be considered. Studies beyond diagnostic accuracy that evaluate feasibility and population-level impacts are also needed. A biomarker-based diagnostic may be critical to ending the TB epidemic, but requires appropriate validation before implementation.

Recommendation 8 — rapid molecular DST use for rifampin resistance states: We recommend performing rapid molecular DST for detection of rifampin resistance in the respiratory specimens of persons who are either AFB smear positive or Hologic Amplified MTD positive and who meet one of the following criteria: (1) have been treated for tuberculosis in the past, (2) were born in or have lived for at least 1 year in a foreign country with at least a moderate tuberculosis incidence (≥ 20 per 100 000) or a high primary MDR-TB prevalence (≥ 2%), (3) are contacts of patients with MDR-TB, or (4) are HIV infected (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence); remarks specify this applies to patients who are Hologic Amplified MTD positive only because that NAAT detects TB but not drug resistance, and it is not applicable to patients positive for NAAT types that detect drug resistance, including many line probe assays and Cepheid Xpert MTB/RIF.

### Where are the missing people affected by tuberculosis? A programme review of patient-pathway and cascade of care to optimise tuberculosis case-finding, treatment and prevention in Cambodia [^116zzoce]. BMJ Global Health (2023). High credibility.

Discussion

In Cambodia, TB services are predominantly provided by the public sector. The private sector does not provide direct TB care, and the notification rate remains poor. However, as in many high TB burden countries, most people with presumptive TB preferred to seek private healthcare. Such inclination was estimated to incur more than two-thirds of Cambodia's out-of-pocket healthcare payments. In a 2015 systematic review, Lei and colleagues reported positive TB case detection rates and improved treatment outcomes through the involvement of the private health sector in referrals, diagnosis, treatment, awareness-raising and health education. While there have been efforts to improve referrals from the private to the public sector, inadequate funding, strong dependence on incentive-based referrals, challenges in persuading private medical practitioners to partake and maintaining seamless coordination between the sectors have hampered the scale-up and sustainability of public–private engagement in TB control. As the private sector plays a significant role in the care pathway, revitalising and contextualising the public–private engagement programmes will be critical in finding unreached and undiagnosed cases. Solutions should be tailored according to the country's contexts for success and sustainability.

The availability of TB diagnostic modalities, such as smear microscopy and GeneXpert, in health facilities plays a crucial role in delivering TB services. TB work-up might not be initiated appropriately in places where such resources are scarce. The availability of GeneXpert systems in Cambodia has increased over the years (26 devices in 2015 and 75 in 64 sites in 2019). But the coverage will likely remain inadequate at 1.4 health facilities with GeneXpert assays per 1000 estimated incident TB cases. The requisite to ramp up the availability of rapid diagnostics is one of NTP's primacies.TB diagnostic tools have a different turnaround and reporting time — GeneXpert assay (approximately 3 hours), smear microscopy (about 19 hours) and cultures (≥ 14 days) — resulting in considerable impact on the time to diagnosis and treatment initiation. Nevertheless, the implementation of molecular diagnostics relies on a strong healthcare ecosystem comprising a sufficient and appropriately skilled workforce and robust specimen transportation, storage, communication and follow-up systems, which may be lacking in under-resourced settings. Furthermore, the quality of sputum specimens and laboratory processes are also critical in improving TB diagnosis. Therefore, these facets should be accounted for while considering the roll-out and scale-up of TB diagnostic modalities.

### Defining the needs for next generation assays for tuberculosis [^114hagE3]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

To accelerate the fight against tuberculosis, major diagnostic challenges need to be addressed urgently. Post-2015 targets are unlikely to be met without the use of novel diagnostics that are more accurate and can be used closer to where patients first seek care in affordable diagnostic algorithms. This article describes the efforts by the stakeholder community that led to the identification of the high-priority diagnostic needs in tuberculosis. Subsequently target product profiles for the high-priority diagnostic needs were developed and reviewed in a World Health Organization (WHO)-led consensus meeting. The high-priority diagnostic needs included (1) a sputum-based replacement test for smear-microscopy; (2) a non-sputum-based biomarker test for all forms of tuberculosis, ideally suitable for use at levels below microscopy centers; (3) a simple, low cost triage test for use by first-contact care providers as a rule-out test, ideally suitable for use by community health workers; and (4) a rapid drug susceptibility test for use at the microscopy center level. The developed target product profiles, along with complimentary work presented in this supplement, will help to facilitate the interaction between the tuberculosis community and the diagnostics industry with the goal to lead the way toward the post-2015 global tuberculosis targets.

Pulmonary tuberculosis — nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) on the initial respiratory specimen: We suggest performing a diagnostic NAAT, rather than not performing a NAAT, on the initial respiratory specimen from patients suspected of having pulmonary TB (conditional recommendation, low-quality evidence). In meta-analyses, when acid-fast bacillus (AFB) smear microscopy was positive, the sensitivity and specificity of NAAT were 96% and 85%, respectively, and when AFB smear microscopy was negative, the sensitivity decreased to 66% and the specificity increased to 98%; specificity in untreated patients was 97%, and a second meta-analysis reported an overall sensitivity of 85% and specificity of 97%. A third meta-analysis found that in AFB smear microscopy–negative individuals, a positive NAAT result is beneficial when the clinical suspicion of tuberculosis was intermediate or high (> 30%) and a negative NAAT result is of little use in excluding the presence of Mtb. Remarks specify that in AFB smear–positive patients, a negative NAAT makes TB disease unlikely, and in AFB smear–negative patients with an intermediate to high level of suspicion, a positive NAAT can be used as presumptive evidence of TB disease but a negative NAAT cannot be used to exclude TB. Rationale notes that mycobacterial culture results require at least 1–2 weeks and that in AFB smear–positive patients, NAAT yields false-negative results only 4% of the time.

Histological examination for tuberculosis diagnosis — At this stage in the diagnostic process, the committee thought testing was worthwhile if sensitivity and specificity were both > 50%, and histological examination surpassed these thresholds and, therefore, is recommended; the committee emphasizes interpreting results within the clinical context, and the recommendation is conditional because the very low quality of evidence does not provide sufficient confidence, and obtaining the specimens to test usually requires an invasive procedure such that the balance of benefits versus risks may vary substantially depending upon the clinical condition of the patient.

### Toward the development of a circulating free DNA-basedDiagnostic test for infectious diseases: a review of evidence for tuberculosis [^1141NJ7N]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Challenges in the development of a cfDNA-based IVD test.

In the following section, the main challenges for the development of an IVD test are described. One of the main challenges for the development of a cfDNA assay is performing appropriate sample pretreatment (i.e. sample processing prior to the amplification and detection step), given the low cfDNA concentration in biological fluids. Unfortunately, despite the large number of research studies in the field of cfDNA, there is a lack of standardization in preanalytical methodology according to numerous reviews in the field. The preanalytical factors which might affect cfDNA concentration and fragmentation include (i) sample collection, (ii) sample storage, (iii) cfDNA extraction, and (iv) storage of cfDNA extracts. Blood is the matrix that has been most widely studied since it is the matrix of choice for cancer and prenatal analyses, but few preanalytical studies are available regarding cfDNA in urine. Table 3 presents a summary of some research gaps identified relating to preanalytical factors for cfDNA. More information about preanalytical factors for cfDNA can be found in studies and reviews about this topic. To guarantee conclusive results, the standardization of sample collection to ensure uniform preanalytical handling of a sample will be critical. This is of particular importance when pathways from sample collection to processing are long, as is often the case in resource-limited settings. To summarize, universal cfDNA standards and reference materials are needed to harmonize results and methods across time, and they should be made available to test developers and researchers.

### Current evidence on diagnostic accuracy of commercially based nucleic acid amplification tests for the diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis [^112dkT3e]. Thorax (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Even though commercial nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) have become the most frequently used molecular tests for laboratory diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis (TB), published studies report variable estimates of their diagnostic accuracy. We analysed the accuracy of commercial NAATs for the diagnosis of pulmonary TB in smear positive and smear negative respiratory samples using culture as a reference standard.

Methods

English language studies reporting data sufficient for calculating sensitivity and specificity of commercial NAATs on smear positive and/or smear negative respiratory samples were included. Meta-regression was used to analyse associations with reference test quality, the prevalence of TB, sample and test type. Predictive values for different levels of pre-test probability were quantified using Bayes' approach.

Results

Sixty three journal articles published between 1995 and 2004 met the inclusion criteria. Pooled sensitivity and specificity were 0.96 and 0.85 among smear positive samples and 0.66 and 0.98 among smear negative samples. The number of culture media used as reference test, the inclusion of bronchial samples, and the TB prevalence were found to influence the reported accuracy. The test type had no effect on the diagnostic odds ratio but seemed to be correlated with sensitivity or specificity, probably via a threshold effect.

Conclusions

Commercial NAATs can be confidently used to exclude TB in patients with smear positive samples in which environmental mycobacteria infection is suspected and to confirm TB in a proportion of smear negative cases. The methodological characteristics of primary studies have a considerable effect on the reported diagnostic accuracy.

### Guidance for studies evaluating the accuracy of tuberculosis triage tests [^116VnuLM]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Approximately 3.6 million cases of active tuberculosis (TB) go potentially undiagnosed annually, partly due to limited access to confirmatory diagnostic tests, such as molecular assays or mycobacterial culture, in community and primary healthcare settings. This article provides guidance for TB triage test evaluations. A TB triage test is designed for use in people with TB symptoms and/or significant risk factors for TB. Triage tests are simple and low-cost tests aiming to improve ease of access and implementation (compared with confirmatory tests) and decrease the proportion of patients requiring more expensive confirmatory testing. Evaluation of triage tests should occur in settings of intended use, such as community and primary healthcare centers. Important considerations for triage test evaluation include study design, population, sample type, test throughput, use of thresholds, reference standard (ideally culture), and specimen flow. The impact of a triage test will depend heavily on issues beyond accuracy, primarily centered on implementation.

DEVELOPMENTS IN TEST AND PLATFORMS WITH WHO ENDORSEMENT

Table 1 provides an overview of all currently available NAATs that are endorsed by WHO, along with information on diagnostic accuracy.

Line probe assays.

Line probe assays (LPA) for first-line TB drugs (INH and RIF) have been endorsed by WHO for over a decade for the detection of multiple-drug-resistant TB (MDR-TB). These assays include GenoType MTBDRplus (Hain Lifesciences-Bruker, Nehren, Germany) and Nipro NTM+MDRTB II (Osaka, Japan). New-generation LPAs have emerged with higher sensitivity, and some (e.g. GenoType MTBDRsl version 2.0; Hain Lifesciences-Bruker) can detect mutations associated with fluoroquinolones (FLQs) and second-line injectables, kanamycin, amikacin, and capreomycin, and are recommended to guide MDR-TB treatment initiation.

Loop-mediated isothermal amplification.

Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) is an isothermal PCR amplification technique that can be performed in peripheral health care settings. The LAMP-based TB-LAMP assay (Eiken Chemical Company, Tokyo, Japan) has been recommend by WHO as a potential replacement for smear microscopy since 2016, owing to its superior diagnostic performance. It also does not require much sophisticated laboratory equipment (Table 1). Despite this, TB-LAMP is underutilized, but some countries are creating their own LAMP assays for in-country use. Hopefully country-specific versions of LAMP will increase uptake.

### New and improved tuberculosis diagnostics: evidence, policy, practice, and impact [^113fG1dc]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The aim is to summarize the evidence base for tuberculosis (TB) diagnostics, review recent policies on TB diagnostics, and discuss issues such as how evidence is translated into policy, limitations of the existing evidence base, and challenges involved in translating policies into impact.

Recent Findings

Case detection continues to be a major obstacle to global TB control. Fortunately, due to an unprecedented level of interest, funding, and activity, the new diagnostics pipeline for TB has rapidly expanded. There have been several new policies and guidelines on TB diagnostics. However, there are major gaps in the existing pipeline (e.g. lack of a point-of-care test) and the evidence base is predominantly made up of research studies of test accuracy.

Summary

With the availability of new diagnostics and supporting policies, the next major step is translation of policy into practice. The impact of new tests will depend largely on the extent of their introduction and acceptance into the global public sector. This will itself depend in part on policy decisions by international technical agencies and national TB programs. With the engagement of all key stakeholders, we will need to translate evidence-based policies into epidemiological and public health impact.

### Implementation strategies to increase the uptake and impact of molecular WHO-recommended rapid diagnostic tests: evidence from a mixed-methods systematic review [^116jTHbY]. BMJ Global Health (2025). High credibility.

Key review findings

We synthesised our findings on implementation strategies across cascade steps into six key findings that can be used to inform mWRD and other diagnostic test implementation planning. Table 1 provides an evidence summary of these findings including the level of confidence in each finding (high confidence for three and moderate confidence for three).

Table 1
Summary of key findings of evidence synthesis with CERQual assessment

Multicomponent strategies should be designed and tested to address implementation barriers at all levels of the tuberculosis cascade. These strategies should be iteratively adapted with feedback obtained from robust quality improvement processes and operational research that considers contextual realities prior to and during implementation.

Reaching all people with presumptive TB requires a person-centred approach to TB care delivery that addresses the varied and complex barriers impacting engagement with TB diagnostic processes.mWRD implementation strategies should include active case finding and community-based testing.

Supporting access to mWRDs in peripheral healthcare settings involves innovation in implementation including critical steps like sample transport to minimise delays. Collaboration between private and public partners can shift mWRDs closer to where patients access care. Prioritising underserved and high-risk populations is critical to ensure equitable access to mWRD technologies.

Ensuring that mWRDs are used as the first test for TB requires high-quality training, collaboration and longitudinal engagement with health workers and other key implementers in public and private sectors. Diagnostic network improvement should be undertaken periodically to ensure testing platforms are placed and used to address regional and national testing needs. Multidisease testing approaches should be implemented as part of broader health system strengthening efforts.

Ensuring action following diagnosis using mWRD is critical but often overlooked. Data management systems should be linked with electronic medical record systems and leverage SMS and other mHealth technologies including automatic electronic notifications.

Developing systems to support timely notification and treatment initiation should leverage mHealth solutions including software linked to mWRD platforms that facilitate linkage and retention throughout the cascade of care beyond diagnosis.

### Evaluation of tuberculosis diagnostics: establishing an evidence base around the public health impact [^111Gjk3P]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

Global control of the tuberculosis epidemic is a public health priority. The targets for reduction in tuberculosis prevalence and mortality linked to the Millennium Development Goals and enshrined in the STOP TB Global Plan 2006–2015 will not be achieved with current interventions. There is an acute need for improved tuberculosis diagnostics as one critical component of the public health response to the tuberculosis epidemic.

The rapid growth of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) epidemic and the emergence of antituberculosis drug resistance have highlighted the major deficiencies in current diagnostic technologies both for pathogen detection and for diagnosis of drug resistance. In most high-burden countries, sputum smear microscopy remains the principal tool for diagnosing active disease; however, operationally, its sensitivity for pulmonary tuberculosis can be as low as 20%. Sputum culture and drug susceptibility testing are available in certain settings, but their impact is limited by the long duration and complexity of the laboratory processes. Additional challenges are faced in developing diagnostics for extrapulmonary tuberculosis, pediatric tuberculosis, and latent tuberculosis infection.

The STOP TB Global Plan 2006–2015 included the target that, "by 2010, simple, robust, affordable technologies for use at peripheral levels of the health system will enable rapid, sensitive detection of active tuberculosis at the first point of care" [, p. 24]. Although this has not been achieved, there have been developments in the tuberculosis diagnostic field, and promising technologies have entered the clinical sphere. Most promising has been the Xpert MTB/RIF system, an automated molecular test that simultaneously detects Mycobacterium tuberculosis and mutations associated with rifampicin resistance. It is hoped that the renewed global focus on tuberculosis will in the next few years lead to the further proliferation of diagnostic technologies in parallel with advances in therapeutics and vaccines.

It is the responsibility of the global scientific community to correctly evaluate these new technologies so that proven effective and cost-effective diagnostics can be adopted, thus generating the greatest public health impact. The importance of diagnostic research in the overall tuberculosis research agenda has been highlighted by many different groups. However, huge gaps in funding for tuberculosis research and tuberculosis control remain; this should force us to rethink how diagnostic research can be most effectively targeted and rationalized to inform public health policies.

ALTERNATIVES TO CULTURE FOR DETECTION OF M. tuberculosis

Until very recently, the performance of nucleic acid amplification assays (NAAs) for the detection of M. tuberculosis DNA or RNA in patient samples has been disappointing. In adults, commercial assays display high specificity (pooled specificity, 97%) but poor sensitivity for smear-negative samples (pooled estimate, 66%). Although there have been no large studies evaluating the performance of these commercial assays in children, in one study, the sensitivity of the Roche Amplicor MTB test was disappointing (44%). The performance of in-house assays has been highly variable, probably because of variability in patient populations, DNA extraction and amplification protocols, and operator experience. As a result, in-house assays have not gained widespread acceptance.

Because NAA results can potentially be delivered in hours or days rather than weeks, a positive NAA result from a highly specific assay (such as the commercially available tests) may be useful to rapidly confirm a diagnosis, even if only for a subset of patients. However, the widespread adoption of NAA has been restricted by the need for specialized molecular laboratories and experienced staff, which are seldom available in high-burden settings.

Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)–based line probe assays, such as the Genotype MTBDRplus (Hain Lifescience), are now increasingly used for the rapid detection of drug resistance. Such tests offer sensitive and specific detection of isoniazid and rifampicin resistance directly from smear-positive samples or from positive culture samples. These assays have not specifically been assessed in pediatric populations; however, because the majority of pediatric samples are smear negative, their role would be primarily for detection of resistance in positive culture samples. Such assays require dedicated molecular facilities and highly trained operators.

The development of real-time PCR detection of M. tuberculosis represents an important advance. Real-time PCR allows simultaneous amplification and detection of PCR product, without the need for manipulation of PCR products and the associated risk of amplicon contamination. Furthermore, real-time PCR permits the detection of several different PCR products in the same reaction, allowing simultaneous detection of tuberculosis and drug resistance mutations.

Summary of findings and assessment of the certainty of the evidence

We assessed the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach for diagnostic studies. As recommended, we rated the certainty of evidence as either high (not downgraded), moderate (downgraded by one level), low (downgraded by two levels), or very low (downgraded by more than two levels) based on five domains: risk of bias, indirectness, inconsistency, imprecision, and publication bias. For each outcome, the certainty of evidence started as high when there were high‐quality studies (cross‐sectional or cohort studies) that enrolled participants with diagnostic uncertainty. If we found a reason for downgrading, we used our judgment to classify the reason as either serious (downgraded by one level) or very serious (downgraded by two levels). If we downgraded by two levels for one of the five domains and downgraded by one level for any other of the four domains, this could lead to very low certainty of evidence. Two review authors discussed judgments and applied GRADE in the following way.

Assessment of risk of bias. We used QUADAS‐2 to assess the risk of bias.
Indirectness. We assessed indirectness in relation to the population (including disease spectrum), setting, interventions, and outcomes (accuracy measures). We also used the prevalence of the target condition as a guide to whether there was indirectness in the population.
Inconsistency. GRADE recommends downgrading for unexplained inconsistency in sensitivity and specificity estimates. We carried out prespecified analyses to investigate potential sources of heterogeneity and downgraded when we could not explain inconsistency in the accuracy estimates.
Imprecision. We considered a precise estimate to be one that would allow a clinically meaningful decision. We considered the width of the CI and asked, 'Would we make a different decision if the lower or upper boundary of the CI represented the truth?' In addition, we worked out projected ranges for TP, FN, TN, and FP for a given prevalence of tuberculosis and made judgments on imprecision from these calculations.
Publication bias. We rated publication bias as undetected (not serious) for several reasons: the comprehensiveness of the literature search and extensive outreach to tuberculosis researchers to identify studies; the presence only of studies that produced precise estimates of high accuracy despite small sample size; and our knowledge of studies that were conducted but not published.

### Building the framework for standardized clinical laboratory reporting of next-generation sequencing data for resistance-associated mutations in Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex [^115sqwHR]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Tuberculosis is a critical global health concern, with an estimated 10 million new cases in 2017, including approximately 460 000 multidrug-resistant (MDR) cases (resistant to isoniazid and rifampin). MDR-tuberculosis rates are estimated to rise in 4 high-burden countries due to ongoing transmission, raising the stakes on identification and resistance profiling of new cases. While culture-based phenotyping remains the reference standard for drug susceptibility testing (DST), the paradigm has shifted recently with the World Health Organization (WHO) endorsement and global implementation of molecular assays such as Cepheid Xpert® MTB/RIF and line-probe assays that provide rapid DST results without the time or cost burden of phenotypic testing. While transformative, existing rapid molecular tests are limited by the diversity of resistant genotypes that can be detected simultaneously. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and targeted DNA sequencing directly from clinical samples offer potential comprehensive solutions for rapid diagnosis, DST, and large-scale drug-resistance surveillance. In 2017, Public Health England implemented WGS for all mycobacterial cultures, and the United States announced plans for universal WGS surveillance, while New York State's Wadsworth Center has incorporated WGS since 2016. The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control is also standardizing WGS across the 28 member states to monitor cross-border transmission, and WHO has led multicountry population-level surveys to determine the best use of next-generation sequencing (NGS) and DST worldwide, laying the groundwork for widespread access. Current sequencing programs often rely on centralized government or academic facilities due to the need for specially skilled laboratorians, infrastructure, data management capacity, and bioinformatics. Efforts to overcome these obstacles and aid broader NGS deployment are underway and will likely provide global access to DNA sequencing technologies for clinical diagnosis of drug-resistant tuberculosis in the next 5 years.

INTRODUCTION

Tuberculosis (TB) remains a global health crisis, with 8.2 million new cases and 1.3 million deaths in 2023. In 2023, an estimated 400,000 rifampicin-resistant cases occurred, but 22% were never diagnosed. Furthermore, drug-resistant diagnoses fell by 15% between 2019 and 2022 due to COVID-19. Drug-resistant TB diagnosis requires improvement.

In addition to the better upfront diagnosis of first-line resistance, a key drug-resistant TB care cascade gap is the many people with first-line resistance who do not get second-line drug susceptibility testing (DST). In South Africa in 2023, 12% of multidrug-resistant/rifampicin-resistant (MDR/RR) TB cases did not have second-line DST attempted. Furthermore, in those with it attempted, second-line DST was successful (a resistant or susceptible result generated for a second-line drug) in only 66% of people. Due to these unsuccessful results, which can be frequent from paucibacillary sputum, national algorithms often culture sputum in parallel to direct molecular testing (the isolate may be used for repeat molecular testing and/or phenotypic DST). During culture, contamination can occur, and even if people do return to provide another specimen, care cascade delays and loss occur.

These missed opportunities for second-line DST due to contamination are especially important, given the advent of new and repurposed lifesaving Group A drugs. Although rapid tests for resistance to these drugs are, for the most part, not yet widely available, resistance is more likely to emerge if the number of effective drugs is low. Maximizing second-line DST, including ensuring people with contaminated culture receive appropriate DST as early as possible, is therefore important to protect Group A drugs.

Xpert MTB/XDR (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, USA) is a cartridge-based real-time PCR test endorsed by the World Health Organization in 2021 as a low-complexity reflex test for second-line DST in people with MDR/RR-TB. Xpert MTB/XDR must detect Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) DNA before it can evaluate whether variants associated with resistance to isoniazid, ethionamide, fluoroquinolone, and second-line injectable drugs (SLIDs), such as kanamycin, amikacin, and capreomycin, are present. The results are automatically interpreted using GeneXpert software.

Abstract

Background

Genotype® MTBDR sl (MTBDR sl) is a rapid DNA‐based test for detecting specific mutations associated with resistance to fluoroquinolones and second‐line injectable drugs (SLIDs) in Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex. MTBDR sl version 2.0 (released in 2015) identifies the mutations detected by version 1.0, as well as additional mutations. The test may be performed on a culture isolate or a patient specimen, which eliminates delays associated with culture. Version 1.0 requires a smear‐positive specimen, while version 2.0 may use a smear‐positive or ‐negative specimen. We performed this updated review as part of a World Health Organization process to develop updated guidelines for using MTBDR sl.

Objectives

To assess and compare the diagnostic accuracy of MTBDR sl for: 1. fluoroquinolone resistance, 2. SLID resistance, and 3. extensively drug‐resistant tuberculosis, indirectly on a M. tuberculosis isolate grown from culture or directly on a patient specimen. Participants were people with rifampicin‐resistant or multidrug‐resistant tuberculosis. The role of MTBDR sl would be as the initial test, replacing culture‐based drug susceptibility testing (DST), for detecting second‐line drug resistance.

Search methods

We searched the following databases without language restrictions up to 21 September 2015: the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register; MEDLINE; Embase OVID; Science Citation Index Expanded, Conference Proceedings Citation Index‐Science, and BIOSIS Previews (all three from Web of Science); LILACS; and SCOPUS; registers for ongoing trials; and ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I. We reviewed references from included studies and contacted specialists in the field.

Selection criteria

We included cross‐sectional and case‐control studies that determined MTBDR sl accuracy against a defined reference standard (culture‐based DST, genetic sequencing, or both).

Data collection and analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed quality using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS‐2) tool. We synthesized data for versions 1.0 and 2.0 separately. We estimated MTBDR sl sensitivity and specificity for fluoroquinolone resistance, SLID resistance, and extensively drug‐resistant tuberculosis when the test was performed indirectly or directly (smear‐positive specimen for version 1.0, smear‐positive or ‐negative specimen for version 2.0). We explored the influence on accuracy estimates of individual drugs within a drug class and of different reference standards. We performed most analyses using a bivariate random‐effects model with culture‐based DST as reference standard.

Main results

We included 27 studies. Twenty‐six studies evaluated version 1.0, and one study version 2.0. Of 26 studies stating specimen country origin, 15 studies (58%) evaluated patients from low‐ or middle‐income countries. Overall, we considered the studies to be of high methodological quality. However, only three studies (11%) had low risk of bias for the reference standard; these studies used World Health Organization (WHO)‐recommended critical concentrations for all drugs in the culture‐based DST reference standard.

MTBDR sl version 1.0

Fluoroquinolone resistance: indirect testing, MTBDR sl pooled sensitivity and specificity (95% confidence interval (CI)) were 85.6% (79.2% to 90.4%) and 98.5% (95.7% to 99.5%), (19 studies, 2223 participants); direct testing (smear‐positive specimen), pooled sensitivity and specificity were 86.2% (74.6% to 93.0%) and 98.6% (96.9% to 99.4%), (nine studies, 1771 participants, moderate quality evidence).

SLID resistance: indirect testing, MTBDR sl pooled sensitivity and specificity were 76.5% (63.3% to 86.0%) and 99.1% (97.3% to 99.7%), (16 studies, 1921 participants); direct testing (smear‐positive specimen), pooled sensitivity and specificity were 87.0% (38.1% to 98.6%) and 99.5% (93.6% to 100.0%), (eight studies, 1639 participants, low quality evidence).

Extensively drug‐resistant tuberculosis: indirect testing, MTBDR sl pooled sensitivity and specificity were 70.9% (42.9% to 88.8%) and 98.8% (96.1% to 99.6%), (eight studies, 880 participants); direct testing (smear‐positive specimen), pooled sensitivity and specificity were 69.4% (38.8% to 89.0%) and 99.4% (95.0% to 99.3%), (six studies, 1420 participants, low quality evidence).

Similar to the original Cochrane review, we found no evidence of a significant difference in MTBDR sl version 1.0 accuracy between indirect and direct testing for fluoroquinolone resistance, SLID resistance, and extensively drug‐resistant tuberculosis.

MTBDR sl version 2.0

Fluoroquinolone resistance: direct testing, MTBDR sl sensitivity and specificity were 97% (83% to 100%) and 98% (93% to 100%), smear‐positive specimen; 80% (28% to 99%) and 100% (40% to 100%), smear‐negative specimen.

SLID resistance: direct testing, MTBDR sl sensitivity and specificity were 89% (72% to 98%) and 90% (84% to 95%), smear‐positive specimen; 80% (28% to 99%) and 100% (40% to 100%), smear‐negative specimen.

Extensively drug‐resistant tuberculosis: direct testing, MTBDR sl sensitivity and specificity were 79% (49% to 95%) and 97% (93% to 99%), smear‐positive specimen; 50% (1% to 99%) and 100% (59% to 100%), smear‐negative specimen.

We had insufficient data to estimate summary sensitivity and specificity of version 2.0 (smear‐positive and ‐negative specimens) or to compare accuracy of the two versions.

A limitation was that most included studies did not consistently use the World Health Organization (WHO)‐recommended concentrations for drugs in the culture‐based DST reference standard.

Authors' conclusions

In people with rifampicin‐resistant or multidrug‐resistant tuberculosis, MTBDR sl performed on a culture isolate or smear‐positive specimen may be useful in detecting second‐line drug resistance. MTBDR sl (smear‐positive specimen) correctly classified around six in seven people as having fluoroquinolone or SLID resistance, although the sensitivity estimates for SLID resistance varied. The test rarely gave a positive result for people without drug resistance. However, when second‐line drug resistance is not detected (MTBDR sl result is negative), conventional DST can still be used to evaluate patients for resistance to the fluoroquinolones or SLIDs.

We recommend that future work evaluate MTBDR sl version 2.0, in particular on smear‐negative specimens and in different settings to account for different resistance‐causing mutations that may vary by strain. Researchers should also consider incorporating WHO‐recommended critical concentrations into their culture‐based reference standards.

### Targeted next-generation sequencing for drug-resistant tuberculosis diagnosis: implementation considerations for bacterial load, regimen selection and diagnostic algorithm placement [^116AQq84]. BMJ Global Health (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Early and accurate diagnosis of drug-resistant tuberculosis (DR-TB) is essential for improving treatment outcomes. Phenotypic drug susceptibility testing (pDST) is comprehensive but slow, while rapid molecular assays provide resistance information for a limited number of drugs. Targeted next-generation sequencing (tNGS) offers the potential for broad and rapid resistance detection, but its integration into diagnostic algorithms has been hindered by uncertainty about its placement within existing workflows.

Methods

This study evaluated the extent to which two tNGS solutions-Deeplex Myc-TB (GenoScreen) and TB Drug Resistance Test (Oxford Nanopore Technologies, ONT)-provided interpretable drug resistance results that could inform regimen design, in comparison to other WHO-recommended molecular assays and pDST. Data were collected from three high-burden DR-TB settings under the Seq&Treat study. Sequencing success rates and drug resistance detection were analysed based on: (1) the initial Xpert MTB/RIF result (very low, low, medium, high), (2) resistance results for drugs in WHO-recommended regimens and (3) performance relative to other WHO-endorsed assays. The potential impact of different algorithms on the estimates was also considered. Key factors influencing successful tNGS adoption within diagnostic pathways were identified, leveraging insights from the Seq&Treat diagnostic accuracy study.

Results

Sequencing success rates were 88.5% (GenoScreen) and 93.1% (ONT) across 763 samples. While tNGS provided complete resistance data for 73%-86% of drugs in recommended regimens, pDST achieved 92%-93%. Both tNGS solutions matched or exceeded the sensitivity of WHO-recommended molecular assays.

Conclusions

This study highlights the critical role of tNGS as a centralised tool for comprehensive drug resistance testing to inform DR-TB treatment decisions following initial screening assays. By complementing existing molecular tests with tNGS, diagnostic workflows can be optimised to ensure timely and comprehensive resistance detection. These findings support policy updates to integrate tNGS into global TB diagnostic algorithms.

### Two pandemics, one challenge-leveraging molecular test capacity of tuberculosis laboratories for rapid COVID-19 case-finding [^112Z15ET]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

In many settings, the ongoing coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic coincides with other major public health threats, in particular tuberculosis. Using tuberculosis (TB) molecular diagnostic infrastructure, which has substantially expanded worldwide in recent years, for COVID-19 case-finding might be warranted. We analyze the potential of using TB diagnostic and research infrastructures for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) testing. We focused on quality control by adapting the 12 Quality System Essentials framework to the COVID-19 and TB context. We conclude that diagnostic infrastructures for TB can in principle be leveraged to scale-up SARS-CoV-2 testing, in particular in resource-poor settings. TB research infrastructures also can support sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 to study virus evolution and diversity globally. However, fundamental principles of quality management must be followed for both TB and SARS-CoV-2 testing to ensure valid results and to minimize biosafety hazards, and the continuity of TB diagnostic services must be guaranteed at all times.

### Using molecular testing and whole-genome sequencing for tuberculosis diagnosis in a low-burden setting: a cost-effectiveness analysis using transmission-dynamic modelling [^111rch8S]. Thorax (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Despite progress in TB control in low-burden countries like England and Wales, there are still diagnostic delays. Molecular testing and/or whole-genome sequencing (WGS) provide more rapid diagnosis but their cost-effectiveness is relatively unexplored in low-burden settings.

Methods

An integrated transmission-dynamic health economic model is used to assess the cost-effectiveness of using WGS to replace culture-based drug-sensitivity testing, versus using molecular testing versus combined use of WGS and molecular testing, for routine TB diagnosis. The model accounts for the effects of faster appropriate treatment in reducing transmission, benefiting health and reducing future treatment costs. Cost-effectiveness is assessed using incremental net benefit (INB) over a 10-year horizon with a quality-adjusted life-year valued at £20 000, and discounting at 3.5%per year.

Results

WGS shortens the time to drug sensitivity testing and treatment modification where necessary, reducing treatment and hospitalisation costs, with an INB of £7.1 million. Molecular testing shortens the time to TB diagnosis and treatment. Initially, this causes an increase in annual costs of treatment, but averting transmissions and future active TB disease subsequently, resulting in cost savings and health benefits to achieve an INB of £8.6 million (GeneXpert MTB/RIF) or £11.1 million (Xpert-Ultra). Combined use of Xpert-Ultra and WGS is the optimal strategy we consider, with an INB of £16.5 million.

Conclusion

Routine use of WGS or molecular testing is cost-effective in a low-burden setting, and combined use is the most cost-effective option. Adoption of these technologies can help low-burden countries meet the WHO End TB Strategy milestones, particularly the UK, which still has relatively high TB rates.

### Collaborative effort for a centralized worldwide tuberculosis relational sequencing data platform [^114H3T9P]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Continued progress in addressing challenges associated with detection and management of tuberculosis requires new diagnostic tools. These tools must be able to provide rapid and accurate information for detecting resistance to guide selection of the treatment regimen for each patient. To achieve this goal, globally representative genotypic, phenotypic, and clinical data are needed in a standardized and curated data platform. A global partnership of academic institutions, public health agencies, and nongovernmental organizations has been established to develop a tuberculosis relational sequencing data platform (ReSeqTB) that seeks to increase understanding of the genetic basis of resistance by correlating molecular data with results from drug susceptibility testing and, optimally, associated patient outcomes. These data will inform development of new diagnostics, facilitate clinical decision making, and improve surveillance for drug resistance. ReSeqTB offers an opportunity for collaboration to achieve improved patient outcomes and to advance efforts to prevent and control this devastating disease.

### Sensitive pathogen DNA detection by a multi-guide RNA cas12a assay favoring trans-versus cis-cleavage [^112RTkj6]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Molecular diagnostic advances have substantially improved disease diagnosis, as revealed during the COVID-19 pandemic, and can facilitate early intervention and personalized treatment. However, half the global population has limited access to such tests, obscuring the true burden of many diseases, particularly those linked to poverty, and increasing their mortality and socio-economic consequences. For example, Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infections are responsible for an estimated 10 million new tuberculosis (TB) cases and 1.6 million TB-related deaths annually, which disproportionately affect low- and middle-income countrieswhere > 35% of new cases go undiagnosed. There is thus an urgent need to develop streamlined diagnostics that address diagnostic challenges faced by poor, rural, and marginalized communities.

CRISPR-based assays provide a means to rapidly detect specific pathogen-derived nucleic acid sequences for disease diagnosis, and employ ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes composed of a CRISPR-associated (Cas) protein and a guide RNA (gRNA) to bind a target sequence and cleave a ssDNA reporter, but have issues that limit their clinical translation –. For example, amplification-free CRISPR assays have shown promise for COVID-19 testing, but usually require relatively high concentrations of pathogen-derived nucleic acid for effective diagnosis, whereas Mtb DNA concentrations are low in most diagnostic specimens. Some studies have employed multiple gRNA to enhance reporter cleavage and signal production but these assays have yielded only moderate sensitivity increases. Most CRISPR-based TB diagnostics therefore employ a two-step process that pre-amplifies the target to increase signal production. This approach has been adapted for TB diagnosis, and can detect trace Mtb DNA levels in aseptic body fluids to enable TB diagnosis in populations that have difficulty producing diagnostic sputum specimens. However, clinical adoption of such tests has been delayed by their lack of clinical validation studies; complex workflows that are impractical for use in clinical applications, especially in resource-limited settings; and significant contamination risks.

### The diagnostic accuracy of the genoType® MTBDRsl assay for the detection of resistance to second-line anti-tuberculosis drugs [^115Mq4d8]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Assessment of methodological quality

We appraised the quality of the included studies with the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2) tool (Whiting; Appendix 4). QUADAS-2 consists of four domains: patient selection, index test, reference standard, and flow and timing. We assessed all domains for the potential for risk of bias and the first three domains for concerns regarding applicability. We used signalling questions in each domain to form judgments about the risk of bias. One review author (GT) piloted the tool with two included studies and finalized the tool based on experience gained from the pilot testing. Two review authors then independently assessed methodological quality of included studies with the finalized tool.

### The rapid molecular test xpert MTB / RIF ultra: towards improved tuberculosis diagnosis and rifampicin resistance detection [^117RrBox]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Tuberculosis diagnosis has dramatically improved since the introduction of the rapid molecular test Xpert MTB/RIF (Xpert) detecting M. tuberculosis and rifampicin resistance directly from clinical specimens, therefore shortening the turnaround time, reducing patient's isolation period and decreasing the time to start anti-TB drugs. The new version, Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra (Ultra), displays a higher sensitivity and an improved rifampicin resistance detection. Both tests have been endorsed by the World Health Organisation.

Aims

Xpert and Ultra rapidly became widespread and paved the way for new approaches and new paradigms as well as for the development of molecular point-of-care tests (POCTs). In this narrative review, we aimed to address their performance in the diagnosis of tuberculosis and to discuss the expectations of these tests as well as their limits and the unmet needs.

Sources

Peer-reviewed publications addressing the diagnostic performance of Ultra and Xpert.

Content

We focused on publications that evaluated the performance of Ultra and Xpert on the same group of patients or the same set of specimens in different tuberculosis-burden settings.

Implications

The studies published so far reported an increased sensitivity of Ultra when compared to Xpert, which represents a benefit for tuberculosis diagnosis. The fact that such a sensitive assay cannot distinguish between alive and dead bacilli emphasizes that caution should be exercised regarding indications and interpretation of results. Additional studies are needed to determine the true performance for the diagnosis of extrapulmonary tuberculosis because of the great diversity of the specimens.

Rapid molecular DST — alternative assays, validation, and confirmation of rifampin resistance: Other assays using alternative molecular techniques (eg, automated real-time polymerase chain reaction [PCR] with sequencing, loop-mediated isothermal amplification [LAMP]) are being developed, and these assays are promising, but are not yet commercially available; data on in-house tests show substantial heterogeneity, and if in-house tests are to be used, they should be validated and shown to have performance accuracy at least comparable to that of commercial tests. Because the prevalence of rifampin resistance is low in the United States, the PPV of Xpert MTB/RIF or other assays will be lower than in settings where Xpert MTB/RIF has been predominantly studied; therefore, confirmation of a positive test result for rifampin resistance has been recommended, and to confirm a positive result, genetic loci associated with rifampin resistance (to include rpoB), as well as isoniazid resistance (to include inhA and katG), should be sequenced to assess for MDR-TB. It is possible that these techniques will be sufficiently sensitive to be used for AFB smear–negative specimens, and laboratories in the United States should only use tests approved by the FDA or tests that have been produced and validated in accord with applicable FDA and Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments regulations.

### Alignment of new tuberculosis drug regimens and drug susceptibility testing: a framework for action [^117HCPHF]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2013). Medium credibility.

New tuberculosis drug regimens are creating new priorities for drug susceptibility testing (DST) and surveillance. To minimise turnaround time, rapid DST will need to be prioritised, but developers of these assays will need better data about the molecular mechanisms of resistance. Efforts are underway to link mutations with drug resistance and to develop strain collections to enable assessment of new diagnostic assays. In resource-limited settings, DST might not be appropriate for all patients with tuberculosis. Surveillance data and modelling will help country stakeholders to design appropriate DST algorithms and to decide whether to change drug regimens. Finally, development of practical DST assays is needed so that, in countries where surveillance and modelling show that DST is advisable, these assays can be used to guide clinical decisions for individual patients. If combined judiciously during both development and implementation, new tuberculosis regimens and new DST assays have enormous potential to improve patient outcomes and reduce the burden of disease.

Testing for TB disease — AFB smear microscopy, culture, and NAAT: We recommend that acid-fast bacilli (AFB) smear microscopy be performed, rather than no AFB smear microscopy, in all patients suspected of having pulmonary TB (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). False-negative results are sufficiently common that a negative AFB smear result does not exclude pulmonary TB. Similarly, false-positive results are sufficiently common that a positive AFB smear result does not confirm pulmonary TB. Providers should request a sputum volume of at least 3 mL, but the optimal volume is 5–10 mL. Concentrated respiratory specimens and fluorescence microscopy are preferred. We suggest that both liquid and solid mycobacterial cultures be performed, rather than either culture method alone, for every specimen obtained from an individual with suspected TB disease (conditional recommendation, low-quality evidence). At least liquid culture should be done on all specimens as culture is the gold standard microbiologic test for the diagnosis of TB disease. The isolate recovered should be identified according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines and the American Society for Microbiology Manual of Clinical Microbiology. We suggest performing a diagnostic nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT), rather than not performing a NAAT, on the initial respiratory specimen from patients suspected of having pulmonary TB (conditional recommendation, low-quality evidence).

### The diagnostic accuracy of the genoType® MTBDRsl assay for the detection of resistance to second-line anti-tuberculosis drugs [^113aojZh]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Accurate and rapid tests for tuberculosis (TB) drug resistance are critical for improving patient care and decreasing the transmission of drug-resistant TB. Genotype(®)MTBDRsl (MTBDRsl) is the only commercially-available molecular test for detecting resistance in TB to the fluoroquinolones (FQs; ofloxacin, moxifloxacin and levofloxacin) and the second-line injectable drugs (SLIDs; amikacin, kanamycin and capreomycin), which are used to treat patients with multidrug-resistant (MDR-)TB.

Objectives

To obtain summary estimates of the diagnostic accuracy of MTBDRsl for FQ resistance, SLID resistance and extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB; defined as MDR-TB plus resistance to a FQ and a SLID) when performed (1) indirectly (ie on culture isolates confirmed as TB positive) and (2) directly (ie on smear-positive sputum specimens). To compare summary estimates of the diagnostic accuracy of MTBDRsl for FQ resistance, SLID resistance and XDR-TB by type of testing (indirect versus direct testing). The populations of interest were adults with drug-susceptible TB or drug-resistant TB. The settings of interest were intermediate and central laboratories.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases without any language restriction up to 30 January 2014: Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register; MEDLINE; EMBASE; ISI Web of Knowledge; MEDION; LILACS; BIOSIS; SCOPUS; the metaRegister of Controlled Trials; the search portal of the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform; and ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I.

Selection Criteria

We included all studies that determined MTBDRsl accuracy against a defined reference standard (culture-based drug susceptibility testing (DST), genetic testing or both). We included cross-sectional and diagnostic case-control studies. We excluded unpublished data and conference proceedings.

Data Collection and Analysis

For each study, two review authors independently extracted data using a standardized form and assessed study quality using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2) tool. We performed meta-analyses to estimate the pooled sensitivity and specificity of MTBDRsl for FQ resistance, SLID resistance, and XDR-TB. We explored the influence of different reference standards. We performed the majority of analyses using a bivariate random-effects model against culture-based DST as the reference standard.

Main Results

We included 21 unique studies: 14 studies reported the accuracy of MTBDRsl when done directly, five studies when done indirectly and two studies that did both. Of the 21 studies, 15 studies (71%) were cross-sectional and 11 studies (58%) were located in low-income or middle-income countries. All studies but two were written in English. Nine (43%) of the 21 included studies had a high risk of bias for patient selection. At least half of the studies had low risk of bias for the other QUADAS-2 domains. As a test for FQ resistance measured against culture-based DST, the pooled sensitivity of MTBDRsl when performed indirectly was 83.1% (95% confidence interval (CI) 78.7% to 86.7%) and the pooled specificity was 97.7% (95% CI 94.3% to 99.1%), respectively (16 studies, 1766 participants; 610 confirmed cases of FQ-resistant TB; moderate quality evidence). When performed directly, the pooled sensitivity was 85.1% (95% CI 71.9% to 92.7%) and the pooled specificity was 98.2% (95% CI 96.8% to 99.0%), respectively (seven studies, 1033 participants; 230 confirmed cases of FQ-resistant TB; moderate quality evidence). For indirect testing for FQ resistance, four (0.2%) of 1766 MTBDRsl results were indeterminate, whereas for direct testing 20 (1.9%) of 1033 were MTBDRsl indeterminate (P < 0.001). As a test for SLID resistance measured against culture-based DST, the pooled sensitivity of MTBDRsl when performed indirectly was 76.9% (95% CI 61.1% to 87.6%) and the pooled specificity was 99.5% (95% CI 97.1% to 99.9%), respectively (14 studies, 1637 participants; 414 confirmed cases of SLID-resistant TB; moderate quality evidence). For amikacin resistance, the pooled sensitivity and specificity were 87.9% (95% CI 82.1% to 92.0%) and 99.5% (95% CI 97.5% to 99.9%), respectively. For kanamycin resistance, the pooled sensitivity and specificity were 66.9% (95% CI 44.1% to 83.8%) and 98.6% (95% CI 96.1% to 99.5%), respectively. For capreomycin resistance, the pooled sensitivity and specificity were 79.5% (95% CI 58.3% to 91.4%) and 95.8% (95% CI 93.4% to 97.3%), respectively. When performed directly, the pooled sensitivity for SLID resistance was 94.4% (95% CI 25.2% to 99.9%) and the pooled specificity was 98.2% (95% CI 88.9% to 99.7%), respectively (six studies, 947 participants; 207 confirmed cases of SLID-resistant TB, 740 SLID susceptible cases of TB; very low quality evidence). For indirect testing for SLID resistance, three (0.4%) of 774 MTBDRsl results were indeterminate, whereas for direct testing 53 (6.1%) of 873 were MTBDRsl indeterminate (P < 0.001). As a test for XDR-TB measured against culture-based DST, the pooled sensitivity of MTBDRsl when performed indirectly was 70.9% (95% CI 42.9% to 88.8%) and the pooled specificity was 98.8% (95% CI 96.1% to 99.6%), respectively (eight studies, 880 participants; 173 confirmed cases of XDR-TB; low quality evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

In adults with TB, a positive MTBDRsl result for FQ resistance, SLID resistance, or XDR-TB can be treated with confidence. However, MTBDRsl does not detect approximately one in five cases of FQ-resistant TB, and does not detect approximately one in four cases of SLID-resistant TB. Of the three SLIDs, MTBDRsl has the poorest sensitivity for kanamycin resistance. MTBDRsl will miss between one in four and one in three cases of XDR-TB. The diagnostic accuracy of MTBDRsl is similar when done using either culture isolates or smear-positive sputum. As the location of the resistance causing mutations can vary on a strain-by-strain basis, further research is required on test accuracy in different settings and, if genetic sequencing is used as a reference standard, it should examine all resistance-determining regions. Given the confidence one can have in a positive result, and the ability of the test to provide results within a matter of days, MTBDRsl may be used as an initial test for second-line drug resistance. However, when the test reports a negative result, clinicians may still wish to carry out conventional testing.

### Bringing patient-centered tuberculosis diagnosis into the light of day [^116bnri2]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Recent evidence

Two recent articles provide welcome data to advance this agenda. In an article published in BMC Medicine on October 27, 2017, Murphy et al. reported the results of a secondary analysis of clinical trial data to answer the question, "Are early-morning sputum samples superior to spot samples for diagnosis of active TB and monitoring for adverse outcomes of TB treatment?" The 1931 study participants were all enrolled in REMoxTB, a Phase III, randomized controlled trial that compared two moxifloxacin-based regimens to shorten the treatment of active, drug-susceptible TB against the standard 6-month regimen. The authors examined the results of smear microscopy, solid culture, and liquid culture performed on 1115 paired spot and early morning sputa collected at baseline for TB diagnosis, and on 2995 paired spot and early morning sputa collected at follow-up for TB treatment monitoring. They found that early morning samples did not significantly improve the performance of spot samples for TB diagnosis or prediction of unfavorable outcomes of TB treatment (i.e. failure and relapse).

In another article published in the August 2017 issue of Lancet Global Health, Datta et al. described the findings of a systematic review and meta-analysis of sputum collection methods for TB diagnosis. The authors identified 23 eligible studies, including 8967 participants, and examined 19,252 sputum samples to determine which non-invasive sputum collection methods are most effective at increasing the diagnostic yield for active TB. Complementing the findings of the REMoxTB secondary analysis, this systematic review showed that neither early morning nor overnight sputum collection increased the yield of microscopy or culture compared with spot sputum collection. Although 24-h pooled sputum collection was associated with increased detection of TB, brief instruction of participants on how to produce a good quality sputum specimen just prior to expectoration provided similar results without requiring a second clinic visit. Furthermore, sputum instruction was associated with increases in yield of a magnitude similar to those produced by molecular testing with the Xpert MTB/RIF assay.

### Rapid molecular tests for tuberculosis and tuberculosis drug resistance: a qualitative evidence synthesis of recipient and provider views [^115uxoFU]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Our review does not consider the accuracy of low‐complexity NAATs or their quantifiable impact on people‐important outcomes. Rather, we are concerned with the perspectives and experiences of end‐users and professional users in dealing with these technologies in their health‐seeking practices, daily work, and routines. For end‐users (i.e. people with presumptive or confirmed tuberculosis or drug‐resistant tuberculosis and their contacts or families), the intervention could be beneficial in terms of the convenience of more immediate test results, easier access to drug resistance testing, an altered diagnostic journey, or a reduced period of anxiety while waiting for results. For professional users such as healthcare providers, the intervention could be beneficial in terms of enabling better‐informed treatment decisions, altered workload and procedures due to more automation, and freeing up time in central laboratories. Such a technology‐in‐practice perspective recognizes that the result of medical practice is always a combination of very different elements including bodies, samples, equipment, materials, clinic organizations, professionals, people receiving healthcare services, conversations, etc. (Timmermans 2003). Studying user perspectives and technology in use is essential to understand aspects of feasibility, uptake, and integration into and linkages to existing services and care and the wider implications for access and health equity.

Why is it important to do this review?

If we do not take the perspective of all users, professional and end‐users, into consideration, we risk that these technologies do not fit their intended use and setting, cannot be made to work and scale up, and are not utilized or not accessible for those in need. Users' experiences and perspectives on new diagnostics relate to their preferences and values, and have implications for acceptability and feasibility, all of which are important considerations during decision‐making on new diagnostics and guideline development.

Laboratory services for optimal TB control — The diagnosis of TB, management of patients with the disease, and public health control services rely on accurate laboratory tests, and laboratory services are an essential component of effective TB control providing key information to clinicians and public health agencies. Up to 80% of all initial TB-related laboratory work is performed in hospitals, clinics, and independent laboratories outside the public health system, whereas more than 50% of species identification and drug susceptibility testing is performed in public health laboratories, underscoring the need for a network of public and private laboratories to optimize testing and information flow.

### Guidance for the evaluation of tuberculosis diagnostics that meet the World Health Organization (WHO) target product profiles: an introduction to WHO process and study design principles [^112scoQQ]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Existing high-priority target product profiles (TPPs) of the World Health Organization (WHO) establish important needs for tuberculosis (TB) diagnostic development. Building on this earlier work, this guidance series aims to provide study guidance for performing accuracy studies of novel diagnostic products that may meet the 4 high-priority WHO TPPs and thus enable adequate evidence generation to inform a WHO evidence review process. Diagnostic accuracy studies represent a fundamental step in the validation of all tests. Unfortunately, such studies often have limitations in design, execution, and reporting, leading to low certainty of the evidence about true test performance, which can delay or impede policy and scale-up decisions. This introductory paper outlines the following: (1) the purpose of this series of papers on study guidance; (2) WHO evidence needs and process for the development of policy guidelines for new TB diagnostic tests; and (3) study design considerations, ie, general diagnostic study considerations, intended use of test and role in the clinical pathway, choice of population and setting, index-test specific issues, suitable reference standard and comparators, study flow and specimen issues, and finally key issues beyond accuracy that should be considered. The other 4 papers in this series will provide more detailed guidance for each of the 4 WHO high-priority TPPs. By increasing the clarity around the clinical evaluation needs for tests that have the potential to meet the TPP specifications, we hope to support harmonized evidence generation and enable the WHO review process towards meeting the WHO End TB Strategy targets for reducing the incidence and mortality associated with TB.

### Unlocking the health system barriers to maximise the uptake and utilisation of molecular diagnostics in low-income and middle-income country setting [^1172Hm3a]. BMJ Global Health (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

The COVID-19 pandemic led to worldwide shutdown and saw unprecedented uptake and utilisation of molecular diagnostics with over 500 million tests conducted in a period of 9 months (statista.com, 9 October 2020). The rapidly evolving COVID-19 is responsible 36.99 million cases and 1.1 million deaths (WHO COVID-19 Dashboard, 11 October 2020). The health systems have been shaken but most importantly the pandemic has raised public consciousness of the value of diagnostics and interdisciplinary approaches in the control of diseases. In contrast, tuberculosis (TB) has been a pandemic for time immemorial and a global public health emergency for over 20 years. A quarter (1.7 billion) of the world population have TB infection and in 2018, 10 million developed active disease resulting in 1.5 million deaths. Of the 10 million notified cases, 55% were bacteriologically confirmed and a small proportion of these were tested using rapid molecular tests. The rate of TB testing does not match incidence of TB disease and, consequently, an estimated 3 million cases go undetected every year.

WHO approved routine use of TB molecular tests more than 10 years ago, starting with the Line Probe Assay (LPA) in 2008 and Xpert Mycobacterium tuberculosis /rifampicin (MTB/RIF) in 2010. The latter detects both TB and resistance to rifampicin in 2 hours and is the widely used molecular test for TB. By 2016, only 16 million Xpert MTB/RIF tests had been performed, translating into 3.2 million tests per year. While there is been steady progress in the uptake and use of Xpert MTB/RIF, the impact of using the same GeneXpert platform for testing HIV viral load and more recently COVID-19 on TB diagnosis is yet to be unravelled. There is sharp contrast in the rate of uptake of COVID-19 molecular tests compared with TB and could a leaf be borrowed from either disease on how to accelerate and maximise translation of health research innovations into policy and practice?

### Genetic determinants of drug resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis and their diagnostic value [^1168jfon]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Rationale

The development of molecular diagnostics that detect both the presence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in clinical samples and drug resistance-conferring mutations promises to revolutionize patient care and interrupt transmission by ensuring early diagnosis. However, these tools require the identification of genetic determinants of resistance to the full range of antituberculosis drugs.

Objectives

To determine the optimal molecular approach needed, we sought to create a comprehensive catalog of resistance mutations and assess their sensitivity and specificity in diagnosing drug resistance.

Methods

We developed and validated molecular inversion probes for DNA capture and deep sequencing of 28 drug-resistance loci in M. tuberculosis. We used the probes for targeted sequencing of a geographically diverse set of 1,397 clinical M. tuberculosis isolates with known drug resistance phenotypes. We identified a minimal set of mutations to predict resistance to first- and second-line antituberculosis drugs and validated our predictions in an independent dataset. We constructed and piloted a web-based database that provides public access to the sequence data and prediction tool.

Measurements and Main Results

The predicted resistance to rifampicin and isoniazid exceeded 90% sensitivity and specificity but was lower for other drugs. The number of mutations needed to diagnose resistance is large, and for the 13 drugs studied it was 238 across 18 genetic loci.

Conclusions

These data suggest that a comprehensive M. tuberculosis drug resistance diagnostic will need to allow for a high dimension of mutation detection. They also support the hypothesis that currently unknown genetic determinants, potentially discoverable by whole-genome sequencing, encode resistance to second-line tuberculosis drugs.

### Application of targeted next-generation sequencing assay on a portable sequencing platform for culture-free detection of drug-resistant tuberculosis from clinical samples [^113snzwq]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2020). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

The World Health Organization's (WHO) End TB Strategy calls for universal access to comprehensive drug susceptibility testing (DST) and early diagnosis of all persons with any form of tuberculosis (TB), as a priority and key component of integrated, patient-centered TB care. Despite global investments in improving laboratory capacity, in 2018, only 51% of people with bacteriologically confirmed TB were tested for rifampicin resistance (RIF r) and less than 60% of the notified multidrug-resistant (MDR)/RIF r patients were tested for second-line resistance. The long turnaround time, the relatively low throughput, and demanding laboratory biosafety requirements make the culture-based phenotypic DST unsuitable as primary tool for clinical management of complex TB cases.

The uptake of WHO-recommended rapid diagnostics (WRDs), Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA), and line probe assays for use on direct clinical samples has contributed significantly to the global increase in number of RIF r TB cases detected and has reduced diagnostic and treatment delays. However, the current WRDs are designed to interrogate only short genomic regions harboring the high-prevalence mutations (i.e. "hot spots") associated with phenotypic resistance to most, but not all, of the first- and second-line drugs. In addition, current WRDs cannot fully discriminate mutations conferring low- and high-level resistance, or mutations not associated with resistance, and cannot be adapted easily to detect new genomic regions associated with resistance to novel and repurposed TB medications recently approved for treatment by the WHO.

### Molecular detection of drug resistance (MDDR) in Mycobacterium… [^115EyQRE]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Changes to CDC's MDDR service Since September 2009, CDC's TB laboratory has offered MDDR as a free molecular testing service to all 50 states, U. S. territories, and U. S. Affiliated Pacific Islands using DNA sequencing for the detection of drug-resistance–associated mutations in MTBC. In February 2023, the MDDR service transitioned to use of primarily targeted next generation sequencing for enhanced early detection of mutations associated with drug resistance. The shift to the tNGS assay allows for deep sequencing of specific genetic loci known to be associated with drug resistance. The methodology is different, but the approach is similar to earlier iterations of MDDR. The change allows for more genetic loci to be examined per test run and better detection of heteroresistance that improves the limit of detection for resistance-associated mutations.

The MDDR tNGS assay was operationalized following a comprehensive evaluation of the tNGS amplicons included in the assay and an associated bioinformatics pipeline. The testing performed is CLIA compliant. Validation included determination of the LOD for heteroresistant populations, intra-assay precision and reproducibility, and clinical sensitivity and specificity. The tNGS assay examines 24 amplicons across 16 genes providing information on more than 12 antituberculosis drugs. Molecular Detection of Drug Resistance Service technology DNA sequencing of genetic loci known to contribute to antibiotic resistance in MTBC will be performed using primarily a tNGS assay. This assay examines specific genomic regions. Briefly, DNA regions of interest are amplified by polymerase chain reaction, and sequencing libraries are generated using the Illumina Nextera XT Library Prep Kit. The libraries are sequenced on the Illumina MiniSeq platform for the MDDR Service.

Thousands of reads are generated for each genetic locus that is sequenced and the reads are mapped to a reference sequence and analyzed for genetic differences. In addition to sequencing, all isolates, including those grown from sediments, will undergo growth-based DST. Material from nucleic acid amplification test positive sediments will be inoculated into growth medium to obtain an MTBC isolate. Growth-based DST will be performed using the agar proportion method. Pyrazinamide testing will be performed by the MGIT 960 method.

### Xpert MTB / RIF assay | Tuberculosis (TB) [^116c2Ja2]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

About the Xpert MTB/RIF Assay The Xpert MTB/RIF assay is a test that helps to rapidly diagnose TB disease and identify drug resistance. The test simultaneously detects Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex and resistance to rifampin in less than 2 hours. In comparison, standard cultures can take 2 to 6 weeks for MTBC to grow, and conventional drug resistance tests can add 3 more weeks. The information provided by the Xpert MTB/RIF assay aids in selecting treatment regimens and reaching infection control decisions quickly. How the Xpert MTB/RIF Assay Works The Xpert MTB/RIF assay is a nucleic acid amplification test that uses a disposable cartridge with the GeneXpert Instrument System. A sputum sample is collected from the patient with suspected TB. The sputum is mixed with the reagent that is provided with the assay, and a cartridge containing this mixture is placed in the GeneXpert machine. All processing from this point on is fully automated.

The Xpert MTB/RIF assay can quickly identify possible multidrug-resistant TB. MDR TB is TB that is resistant to both isoniazid and RIF, two of the most effective TB drugs. RIF resistance is a predictor of MDR TB because resistance to RIF, in most instances, co-exists with resistance to INH. Rapid diagnosis of RIF resistance potentially allows TB patients to start on effective treatment much sooner than waiting for results from other types of drug susceptibility testing. Results from the Xpert MTB/RIF assay indicate whether or not MTBC was detected in the sample. In some instances, the result is "invalid, " whereby the test should be repeated. If MTBC was detected, the results will also state whether resistance to RIF was
- Detected,
- Not detected, or
- Indeterminate. Reminder RIF resistance detected Results that are positive for MTBC and for RIF resistance mean that the bacteria have a high probability of resistance to RIF.

This should be confirmed by additional rapid testing. If RIF resistance is confirmed, rapid molecular testing for drug resistance to both first-line and second-line drugs should be performed so that an effective treatment regimen can be selected. CDC offers rapid molecular detection of drug resistance services through public health laboratories, free of charge.
