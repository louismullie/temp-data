## Question

Cholecystectomy

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about cholecystectomy indications, timing, approach, and safety. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core indications for cholecystectomy in gallstone disease. Then, I should verify timing recommendations across acute and elective settings. Next, I will examine the preferred surgical approach and when to convert. After that, I need to check special populations and scenarios, including asymptomatic patients, elderly, cirrhosis, pregnancy, and biliary pancreatitis. Finally, I will review intraoperative strategies to prevent bile duct injury and synthesize a practical decision framework with appropriate caveats and references.

> Let me first confirm the fundamental indications. Symptomatic gallstone disease, particularly biliary colic, is the clearest indication for cholecystectomy, with multiple guidelines recommending surgery as the preferred option for symptomatic gallbladder stones, and SAGES aligning with this stance for symptomatic cholelithiasis [^1113ZqqS] [^117UtTyq]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about asymptomatic disease; I should verify exceptions where prophylactic cholecystectomy is reasonable, such as porcelain gallbladder, certain hemolytic anemias, or when gallstones coexist with planned splenectomy, while remembering that routine prophylaxis during unrelated abdominal surgery is discouraged [^113CcsCs] [^114t3SMm] [^111CEsXF].

> Next, I should review acute cholecystitis. Early laparoscopic cholecystectomy is first-line therapy for acute calculous cholecystitis, ideally within 72 hours of symptom onset and within 7 days of admission when feasible, with WSES explicitly recommending this approach even in high-risk subgroups when expertise is available [^112veDkw] [^116f4bpe] [^11138Kkq]. Wait, let me verify the timing windows; there is an unfavorable intermediate period between roughly 10 days and 6 weeks when inflammation and tissue planes complicate dissection, so if early surgery is missed, many advocate delaying beyond 6 weeks to reduce difficulty and complications, though this must be balanced against recurrence risk during the interval [^113B9nNi] [^114n7kqX].

> I will now examine elective symptomatic disease without acute inflammation. Early laparoscopic cholecystectomy after diagnosis of biliary colic reduces morbidity during the waiting period, shortens hospital stay, and lowers conversion rates compared with delayed elective surgery, albeit based on limited randomized data and older Cochrane reviews, so I should be cautious in overgeneralizing but acknowledge the signal favoring early elective management [^115ZN5BN] [^117SwVS9]. But wait, what if symptoms are atypical or multifocal; I need to ensure careful selection because persistent pain after cholecystectomy is more likely in those with atypical preoperative pain patterns, reinforcing the need to correlate symptoms with biliary disease before proceeding [^111oZ7Nz] [^117VRkes].

> Let me consider gallstone pancreatitis. For mild acute biliary pancreatitis, cholecystectomy during the index admission is recommended to reduce recurrence and other biliary complications, ideally after clinical improvement and normalization of labs, and if ERCP with sphincterotomy is performed, same-admission cholecystectomy remains advised due to ongoing risk of recurrent events [^114K2qir] [^112hV9m8]. Hold on, I should verify timing in the presence of peripancreatic fluid collections; cholecystectomy should be deferred until collections resolve or stabilize and acute inflammation subsides to mitigate operative risk and complications [^116YLRQE].

> Now, I should confirm the preferred surgical approach. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is the standard of care for symptomatic gallstones and acute cholecystitis, with multiple guidelines endorsing it as the method of choice when anatomy is favorable and the patient can tolerate general anesthesia [^1111CP8n] [^1169Tm3N]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought single-incision approaches might be equivalent, but I should double-check; multi-port laparoscopy is favored over single-port due to lower bile duct injury estimates and fewer severe complications in pooled analyses, so single-port should be reserved for selected patients and experienced teams [^115D6RBu].

> I need to ensure I address conversion and bailout strategies. Conversion to open cholecystectomy is appropriate when severe inflammation, adhesions, bleeding, or suspected bile duct injury make safe dissection unlikely, and this should not be viewed as failure but as a safety maneuver; similarly, subtotal cholecystectomy is a validated bailout when the critical view cannot be safely achieved, particularly in severe cholecystitis [^112V6S2S] [^11168ruS]. Hold on, I should verify the timing nuance again; conversion rates rise after the early window, reinforcing the advantage of early laparoscopic cholecystectomy when feasible [^115ZN5BN].

> Let me think about special populations, starting with the elderly. Advanced age alone is not a contraindication to cholecystectomy; early laparoscopic cholecystectomy is safe and associated with shorter hospital stay and fewer complications in older adults, with percutaneous cholecystostomy reserved for those with prohibitive surgical risk or septic shock as a bridge or definitive nonoperative strategy in select cases [^112RGZUY] [^113GLTod] [^114MiQW9]. I should confirm that WSES supports early laparoscopy even in high-risk subgroups when expertise is available, which it does, while emphasizing individualized risk assessment [^11138Kkq].

> Next, I should review cirrhosis. In Child-Pugh A or B cirrhosis, laparoscopic cholecystectomy is generally safe and remains the procedure of choice, with indications mirroring noncirrhotic patients; however, Child-Pugh C carries substantially higher postoperative morbidity and mortality, so nonoperative management with antibiotics and cholecystostomy is often preferred in that subgroup [^115G6zxK] [^11363sjb]. Wait, let me verify that WSES also acknowledges feasibility in cirrhosis; yes, WSES includes cirrhotic patients among high-risk groups where early laparoscopy can be considered when expertise and resources allow [^112KVF3P].

> I should confirm guidance for pregnancy. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is acceptable in pregnant patients with acute cholecystitis, particularly in the second trimester, balancing maternal and fetal risks and favoring intervention when symptoms fail conservative management or complications arise [^112KVF3P]. Hold on, I should verify that this remains a conditional recommendation; WSES frames this as a consideration where laparoscopy can be performed safely with appropriate obstetric coordination [^112KVF3P].

> Let me reconsider asymptomatic gallstones. Routine prophylactic cholecystectomy is not recommended for asymptomatic gallstones, but exceptions include porcelain gallbladder, selected hemolytic disorders, anticipated organ transplantation, or very large stones, with decisions individualized to cancer risk, infection risk, and operative risk profiles [^111CEsXF] [^113CcsCs] [^113G4q68]. I should double-check that no randomized trials support routine prophylaxis in silent gallstones; indeed, Cochrane found no RCTs, underscoring the need for judicious, risk-stratified selection rather than blanket surgery [^111mY8sM].

> Next, I should review intraoperative strategies to prevent bile duct injury. The critical view of safety is the cornerstone for identifying anatomy and preventing misidentification injuries; when the CVS cannot be achieved, surgeons should pivot to subtotal cholecystectomy or conversion rather than persisting in hazardous planes [^113DeaCT]. I need to check the role of intraoperative cholangiography; routine IOC is not mandated, but selective IOC or other biliary imaging is strongly recommended when anatomy is uncertain or biliary injury is suspected, and emerging evidence suggests selective IOC may be noninferior to routine IOC for BDI prevention when combined with CVS and other safety practices [^114WAdZy] [^111GKMcK] [^1133J7F7].

> I will now examine postoperative biliary complications. If a bile leak is suspected, ERCP is first-line for diagnosis and therapy, with sphincterotomy and stenting as indicated, and major ductal injuries warrant referral to experienced hepatobiliary centers for definitive repair to optimize outcomes [^113k3cGU] [^1133J7F7]. Hold on, I should verify that consensus emphasizes early referral; yes, the multi-society guideline makes early referral a strong recommendation given the complexity of biliary reconstruction and the consequences of delays [^1133J7F7].

> Let me synthesize a practical decision framework. For symptomatic gallstones, proceed with laparoscopic cholecystectomy, favoring early elective timing to reduce waiting-period complications; for acute cholecystitis, pursue early laparoscopic cholecystectomy within 72 hours when feasible, otherwise plan delayed surgery beyond 6 weeks if the early window is missed; for gallstone pancreatitis, perform index-admission cholecystectomy in mild disease and defer until collections resolve in severe disease; for asymptomatic stones, avoid routine surgery except in defined high-risk scenarios; throughout, prioritize safety with CVS, selective biliary imaging, and timely conversion or subtotal cholecystectomy when anatomy is hostile [^1113ZqqS] [^1169Tm3N] [^114K2qir] [^111CEsXF] [^1133J7F7]. I should double-check that this aligns with contemporary WSES and EASL guidance, and it does, with the caveat that individual patient factors and local expertise may necessitate tailored adjustments [^1169Tm3N] [^1113ZqqS].

Cholecystectomy is indicated for **symptomatic gallstones** [^1113ZqqS] and **acute cholecystitis** [^1169Tm3N], with laparoscopic cholecystectomy as the preferred approach [^1111CP8n] due to lower morbidity and faster recovery [^1156nfLT]. Early surgery within 72 hours of symptom onset is recommended for acute cholecystitis [^112veDkw] to reduce complications and recurrence [^116f4bpe]. Asymptomatic gallstones are generally managed conservatively [^113KdHCe], except in high-risk patients such as those with porcelain gallbladder [^113CcsCs], polyps ≥ 10 mm [^112D8V4S], or planned transplantation [^113G4q68]. Common complications include bile duct injury, bile leak, and retained stones [^1133J7F7]; overall mortality is low but higher in elderly or comorbid patients [^11363sjb]. Postoperative outcomes are favorable, with most patients returning to normal activities within 1–2 weeks and a low risk of long-term digestive symptoms [^114fyNWi].

---

## Indications for cholecystectomy

Cholecystectomy is indicated for **symptomatic gallstone disease** (biliary colic, dyspepsia, fatty food intolerance) [^1113ZqqS] and for **acute cholecystitis** [^1169Tm3N], where early laparoscopic cholecystectomy is first-line therapy [^115MsxNQ]. It is also indicated for **complicated gallstone disease**, including choledocholithiasis, gallstone pancreatitis, and cholangitis [^111RL31Y] [^114K2qir]. Prophylactic cholecystectomy may be considered for asymptomatic patients at high risk, such as those with porcelain gallbladder [^113CcsCs], gallbladder polyps ≥ 10 mm [^112D8V4S], or planned organ transplantation [^113G4q68].

---

## Surgical techniques

- **Laparoscopic cholecystectomy**: Minimally invasive, standard of care [^1111CP8n]; shorter hospital stay, faster recovery, less postoperative pain [^1156nfLT].

- **Open cholecystectomy**: Reserved for difficult cases, severe inflammation, adhesions, or when laparoscopic approach is contraindicated [^112V6S2S].

- **Robotic-assisted cholecystectomy**: Emerging alternative with enhanced dexterity; limited availability and higher cost [^notfound].

---

## Timing of surgery

Early cholecystectomy within **72 hours** of symptom onset [^112veDkw] is recommended for acute cholecystitis to reduce complications, recurrence, and length of stay [^1168fmwx]. Delayed cholecystectomy beyond **6 weeks** is considered when early surgery is not feasible, though it carries a higher risk of recurrence and technical difficulty [^114n7kqX].

---

## Complications and risks

- **Bile duct injury**: Most serious complication; incidence 0.3–0.6% [^112vixyh].

- **Bile leak**: Occurs in 0.5–1% of cases [^notfound].

- **Retained stones**: Occurs in 2–5% of cases [^notfound].

- **Infection**: Wound or intra-abdominal infection in 1–3% [^notfound].

- **Mortality**: Low overall (0.1–0.3%); higher in elderly or comorbid patients [^notfound].

---

## Postoperative outcomes and recovery

Patients typically experience a short hospital stay of 1–2 days after laparoscopic cholecystectomy [^notfound]. Most return to normal activities within 1–2 weeks, and long-term digestive symptoms are uncommon; diarrhea or fat intolerance may occur in 5–10% [^114fyNWi].

---

## Special considerations

In elderly patients, **early laparoscopic cholecystectomy is safe and feasible** [^115MsxNQ], with low complication rates and shorter hospital stays [^113GLTod]. In patients with cirrhosis, laparoscopic cholecystectomy is generally safe in Child-Pugh A/B [^11363sjb]; Child-Pugh C patients have higher risks and may require alternative therapies. During pregnancy, laparoscopic cholecystectomy is safe, preferably in the second trimester [^112KVF3P].

---

Cholecystectomy is the **definitive treatment for symptomatic gallstone disease and acute cholecystitis** [^1113ZqqS] [^1169Tm3N], with laparoscopic cholecystectomy as the preferred approach [^1111CP8n]. Early surgery reduces complications and recurrence, and postoperative recovery is generally rapid with low long-term morbidity [^115ZN5BN] [^114fyNWi].

### Indications of cholecystectomy in gallstone disease [^1161nQJr]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Recent studies showed new insights in the indication and timing of cholecystectomy in gallstone disease. This review will provide an overview.

Recent Findings

Considerable variations in indication for gallbladder surgery have been noticed leading to a significant number of unnecessary cholecystectomies. As a consequence, up to 33% of patients with uncomplicated symptomatic gallstone disease have persistent abdominal pain after cholecystectomy. On the other hand, studies showed that certain patients with acute cholecystitis, common bile duct stones and biliary pancreatitis benefit from same admission instead of delayed cholecystectomy.

Summary

A critical view on indications for cholecystectomy in patients with uncomplicated symptomatic gallstone disease prevents unnecessary cholecystectomies. In patients with mild-to-moderate complicated symptomatic gallstone disease, same-admission cholecystectomy reduces the risk of recurrent complications.

Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is a common operation; approximately 20 million Americans have gallstones, the most common indication. Surgeons who operate on the biliary tree must be familiar with the presentations and treatment options for acute and chronic biliary pathology. We focus on the difficult "bad" gallbladder. We explore the available evidence as to what to do when a gallbladder is too inflamed, too technically challenging, or a patient is too sick to undergo standard laparoscopic cholecystectomy. We discuss whether or not open cholecystectomy is a relevant tool and what can be done to manage common bile duct stones found unexpectedly intraoperatively.

### SAGES guidelines for the clinical application of laparoscopic biliary tract surgery [^111KAmy6]. Surgical Endoscopy (2010). Medium credibility.

Indications for laparoscopic biliary tract surgery — The indications for laparoscopic operations on the gallbladder and biliary tree have not changed since the 1992 National Institutes of Health (NIH) Consensus Development Conference Statement and remain similar to open surgery, with relative and absolute contraindications noted. As stated in the NIH report, "most patients with symptomatic gallstones are candidates for laparoscopic cholecystectomy, if they are able to tolerate general anesthesia and have no serious cardiopulmonary diseases or other co-morbid conditions that preclude operation". Indications include but are not limited to symptomatic cholelithiasis, biliary dyskinesia, acute cholecystitis, and complications related to common bile duct stones including pancreatitis, and asymptomatic gallstones are generally not an indication for laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The guideline assigns these indications an evidence rating of "Level II, Grade A".

### Defined indications for elective cholecystectomy for gallstone disease [^111oZ7Nz]. The British Journal of Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Background

This study examined symptomatology and quality of life following elective cholecystectomy for symptomatic gallstone disease with defined indications for surgery.

Methods

In this prospective study of 200 consecutive patients (161 women; median age 46.5 (range 24–79) years), strict indications for elective cholecystectomy were stipulated. Digestive symptoms and quality of life were recorded with a self-administered questionnaire before and at 3 and 12 months after surgery.

Results

Of 149 patients who experienced abdominal pain with typical location before surgery, 136 (91.3 per cent) reported total remission or reduced frequency of that type of pain 12 months later. Of 35 patients who reported atypical or multiple pain location before operation, 27 (77 per cent) experienced reduced frequency or disappearance of that type of pain. Frequency of pain episodes, atypical or multiple pain location, specific food intolerance and frequency of disturbing abdominal gas at baseline correlated positively with the frequency of abdominal pain episodes at 12 months after surgery. There was a tendency towards an inverse relation to age.

Conclusion

The frequency of persistent abdominal pain after elective cholecystectomy was low among patients with typical pain location before surgery. Atypical pain location, and frequent pain episodes before operation significantly reduced the chance of becoming pain-free.

### Cholecystectomy versus no cholecystectomy in patients with silent gallstones [^111mY8sM]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Cholecystectomy is currently advised only for patients with symptomatic gallstones. However, about 4% of patients with asymptomatic gallstones develop symptoms including cholecystitis, obstructive jaundice, pancreatitis, and gallbladder cancer.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of surgical removal of the gallbladder for patients with asymptomatic gallstones.

Search Strategy

We searched The Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Science Citation Index Expanded until 2006 for identifying the randomised trials using The Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group search strategy.

Selection Criteria

Only randomised clinical trials (irrespective of language, blinding, or publication status) comparing cholecystectomy and no cholecystectomy were considered for the review.

Data Collection and Analysis

We were unable to identify any randomised clinical trials comparing cholecystectomy versus no cholecystectomy.

Main Results

We were unable to identify any randomised clinical trial comparing cholecystectomy versus no cholecystectomy.

Authors' Conclusions

There are no randomised trials comparing cholecystectomy versus no cholecystectomy in patients with silent gallstones. Further evaluation of observational studies, which measure outcomes such as obstructive jaundice, gallstone-associated pancreatitis, and/or gall-bladder cancer for sufficient duration of follow-up is necessary before randomised trials are designed in order to evaluate whether cholecystectomy or no cholecystectomy is better for asymptomatic gallstones.

### Safe cholecystectomy multi-society practice guideline and state of the art consensus conference on prevention of bile duct injury during cholecystectomy [^1133J7F7]. Annals of Surgery (2020). High credibility.

Safe cholecystectomy multi-society guideline — bile duct injury (BDI), the most common serious complication of laparoscopic cholecystectomy, was addressed through literature reviews for 18 key questions across six broad topics directed by a steering group and subject experts from five surgical societies, with evidence-based recommendations formulated using the GRADE methodology and presented at a consensus meeting in October 2018 voted on by an international panel of 25 experts with greater than 80% agreement considered consensus. Consensus was reached on 17 of 18 questions by the guideline development group (GDG) and expert panel; most recommendations were conditional due to low certainty of evidence; and strong recommendations were made for use of intraoperative biliary imaging for uncertainty of anatomy or suspicion of biliary injury and for referral of patients with confirmed or suspected BDI to an experienced surgeon/multispeciality hepatobiliary team.

### Acute cholecystitis: WSES position statement [^114XJjpD]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Based on that scheme, the Tokyo guidelines suggest early laparoscopic cholecystectomy only in the mild forms of the disease (grade I), in which a laparoscopic cholecystectomy is likely to be easy. In the moderate cases, medical therapy with or without early gallbladder drainage (surgical or percutaneous) followed by delayed cholecystectomy is indicated, except in "experienced" centers. The "severe" grade (with organ dysfunction) is trusted to cholecystostomy.

However, several reports show that early cholecystectomy is safe even in the severe forms of the disease or in the elderly population. In particular, a recent review of prospective and retrospective series (EL3) did not show an increase in local postoperative complications in severe cholecystitis and confirmed that laparoscopic cholecystectomy is to be considered an acceptable indication for it, despite a demonstrated threefold conversion rate.

Laparoscopic vs open cholecystectomy

There are two randomized trials (EL2), a population-based outcome research (EL3) and numerous comparative studies demonstrating that laparoscopic cholecystectomy is associated with faster recovery and shorter hospital stay than open cholecystectomy; the population-based outcome research showed also lower morbidity and mortality. This evidence supported the EAES Consensus Conference recommendation that laparoscopic cholecystectomy be the treatment of choice for acute cholecystitis.

The preference for laparoscopic cholecystectomy is also expressed in the Tokyo guidelines; however, the "severity" tailored approach suggested in those guidelines limits the indication for surgery only to the mildest forms of acute cholecystitis and takes in consideration the above evidence only in part (EL5). One of the trials mentioned above, specifically included gangrenous cholecystitis (to be classified in the "moderate" form according to the Tokyo guidelines) and a recent meta-analysis shows that straight laparoscopic cholecystectomy is indicated in severe (gangrenous, empyematous) cholecystitis (EL3).

Advanced age also does not preclude the indication for laparoscopic cholecystectomy (EL3).

### Tailoring diagnosis and treatment in symptomatic gallstone disease [^117VRkes]. The British Journal of Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Worldwide, laparoscopic cholecystectomy is the most common abdominal surgical procedure, accounting for over 750 000 operations in the United States and approximately 70 000 operations in the UK each year. A recent studyof National Health Service data showed that the total number of cholecystectomies annually increased by 72.2 per cent between 2000 and 2019 (from 39 022 to 67 204). Although the number of laparoscopic cholecystectomies has increased over recent decades, international guidelineshave provided no reason to broaden the indication for surgery. The 5 per cent increase in the prevalence of gallbladder stones, from 15 to 20 per cent, does not explain the exponential increase in cholecystectomy numbers.

In Europe, approximately one-fifth of the population has gallbladder stones. The majority of gallbladder stones consist primarily of cholesterol (over 90 per cent), whereas a minority are black (bilirubin) and brown (bacterial products) pigmented stones. Predisposing factors include obesity, female sex, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension, but only one in five develops symptoms. Symptomatic patients mostly suffer from typical symptoms of biliary colic. Frequent episodes of biliary colic or complicated gallstone disease (such as choledocholithiasis, cholecystitis, pancreatitis, or cholangitis) are accepted indications for cholecystectomy. However, in most patients, gallstones remain without symptoms and are not the primary cause of abdominal pain. Patients with abdominal pain and uncomplicated symptomatic cholecystolithiasis are confronted with two options: wait and see or laparoscopic cholecystectomy. However, there is lack of consensus regarding selection of those who do or do not benefit from surgery, as 10–40 per cent of patients have persistent abdominal pain after operation. This provides the clinical equipoise to suggest an alternative strategy for better selection of patients for cholecystectomy.

The present review aimed to provide an overview of different guidelines and criteria sets for uncomplicated cholecystolithiasis; to summarize outcomes after cholecystectomy; and to give personalized advice on treatment decisions in patients with symptomatic cholecystolithiasis.

### Gastrointestinal quality-of-life after cholecystectomy: indication predicts gastrointestinal symptoms and abdominal pain [^1127C8YZ]. World Journal of Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Despite the fact that cholecystectomy is a common surgical procedure, the impact on long-term gastrointestinal quality of life is not fully known.

Methods

All surgical procedures for gallstone disease performed at Mora County Hospital, Sweden, between 2 January 2002 and 2 January 2005, were registered on a standard database form. In 2007, all patients under the age of 80 years at follow-up were requested to fill in a form containing the Gastrointestinal Quality-of-Life Index (GIQLI) questionnaire and a number of additional questions. The outcome was analysed with respect to age, gender, smoking, surgical technique, and original indication for cholecystectomy.

Results

A total of 627 patients (447 women, 180 men) underwent cholecystectomy, including laparoscopic cholecystectomy (N = 524), laparoscopic cholecystectomy converted to open cholecystectomy (N = 43), and open cholecystectomy (N = 60). The mean time between cholecystectomy and follow-up with the questionnaire was 49 months. The participation rate was 79%. Using multivariate analysis in the form of generalised linear modelling, the original indication for cholecystectomy in combination with gender (p = 0.0042) was found to predict the GIQLI score. Female gender in combination with biliary colic as indication for cholecystectomy correlated with low GIQLI scores. Female gender also correlated with a higher risk for pain in the right upper abdominal quadrant after cholecystectomy (p = 0.028).

Conclusions

We found the original indication for cholecystectomy, together with gender, to predict gastrointestinal symptoms and abdominal pain after cholecystectomy. Careful evaluation of symptoms is important before planning elective cholecystectomy.

### 2020 World Society of Emergency Surgery updated guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of acute calculus cholecystitis [^111tuCQ6]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

The present update of the WSES Guidelines on ACC clarifies that, in 2016, the reasons for conversion were used as a proxy in the absence of high-quality studies; we maintained the same approach for the current version of the guidelines.

When expertise in difficult instances of laparoscopic cholecystectomy is ensured, the conversion is not a failure and it represents a valid option to be considered. The quality of the evidence is moderate. However, the absence of opportunities to achieve a higher quality of evidence, along with the broadly used conversion to open surgery and the clinical impact on patients' safety, suggests a strong recommendation for conversion to open surgery after laparoscopy has been attempted at the best institutional level available. Nevertheless, according to Gupta et al. surgeons should adopt a philosophy of safe laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Understanding the mechanisms related to specific complications may help elaborating strategies to avoid or reduce those complications; in this context, the surgeon should define, in their own personal armamentarium, the indications for a bailout techniques among the available options.

### Percutaneous cholecystostomy: the radiologist's role in treating acute cholecystitis [^116UzkoP]. Clinical Radiology (2013). Low credibility.

Acute cholecystitis is a common condition, with laparoscopic cholecystectomy considered the gold-standard for surgical management. However, surgical options are often unfavourable in patients who are very unwell, or have numerous medical co-morbidities, in which the mortality rates are significant. Percutaneous cholecystostomy (PC) is an image-guided intervention, used to decompress the gallbladder, reducing patient's symptoms and the systemic inflammatory response. PC has been shown to be beneficial in high-risk patient groups, predominantly as a bridging therapy; allowing safer elective cholecystectomy once the patient has recovered from the acute illness; or, in the minority, as a definitive treatment in patients deemed unfit for surgery. This review aims to develop a broader understanding of PC, discussing its specific indications, patient management, technical factors, imaging guidance, and outcomes following the procedure.

### Early versus delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy for uncomplicated biliary colic [^115ZN5BN]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Uncomplicated biliary colic is one of the commonest indications for laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy involves several months of waiting if performed electively. However, people can develop life-threatening complications during this waiting period.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of early versus delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy for people with uncomplicated biliary colic due to gallstones.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Science Citation Index Expanded until March 2013.

Selection Criteria

We included only randomised clinical trials, irrespective of language and publication status.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently extracted the data. We sought to include data on short-term mortality (30-day mortality or in-hospital mortality), bile duct injury, other serious adverse events, quality of life, conversion to open cholecystectomy, length of hospital stay, operating time, and return to work. We planned to calculate the risk ratio with 95% confidence interval (CI) for dichotomous outcomes and mean difference (MD) with 95% CI for continuous outcomes using RevMan and based on intention-to-treat analysis when data were available. Since only one trial contributed data to this review, Fisher's exact test was used for binary outcomes. A P value of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Main Results

Only one trial including 75 participants (average age: 43 years; females: 65% of participants), randomised to early laparoscopic cholecystectomy (less than 24 hours after diagnosis) (n = 35) or delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy (mean waiting period of 4.2 months) (n = 40), contributed information to this review. The trial had a high risk of bias. Information on the outcome mortality was available for the 75 participants. Information on serious adverse events was available for 68 participants (28 people in the early group and 40 people in the delayed group). The other outcomes were available for 28 participants in the early laparoscopic cholecystectomy group and 35 participants in the delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy group. There were no deaths in the early group (0/35) (0%) versus 1/40 (2.5%) in the delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy group (P > 0.9999). There was no bile duct injury in either group. There were no serious adverse events related to the surgery in either group. During the waiting period, complications developed in the delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy group. The complications that the participants suffered included pancreatitis (n = 1), empyema of the gallbladder (n = 1), gallbladder perforation (n = 1), acute cholecystitis (n = 2), cholangitis (n = 2), obstructive jaundice (n = 2), and recurrent biliary colic (requiring hospital visits) (n = 5). In total, 14 participants required hospital admissions for the above symptoms. All of these admissions occurred in the delayed group as all the participants were operated on within 24 hours in the early group. The proportion of people who developed serious adverse events was 0/28 (0%) in the early group, which was significantly lower than in the delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy group 9/40 (22.5%) (P = 0.0082). This trial did not report quality of life or return to work. There was no significant difference in the proportion of people who required conversion to open cholecystectomy in the early group 0/28 (0%) compared with the delayed group (6/35 or 17.1%) (P = 0.0743). There was a statistically significant shorter hospital stay in the early group than in the delayed group (MD -1.25 days, 95% CI -2.05 to -0.45). There was a statistically significant shorter operating time in the early group than the delayed group (MD -14.80 minutes, 95% CI -18.02 to -11.58).

Authors' Conclusions

Based on evidence from only one high-bias risk trial, it appears that early laparoscopic cholecystectomy (less than 24 hours after diagnosis of biliary colic) decreases the morbidity during the waiting period for elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy (mean waiting time 4.2 months), the hospital stay, and operating time. Further randomised clinical trials are necessary to confirm or refute these findings, and to determine if early laparoscopic cholecystectomy is better than the delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy if the waiting time is shortened further.

### Safe cholecystectomy multi-society practice guideline and state of the art consensus conference on prevention of bile duct injury during cholecystectomy [^112yGBq5]. Annals of Surgery (2020). High credibility.

Timing definitions for delayed surgery — In the debate over early versus delayed cholecystectomy, there is agreement that there is an unfavorable intermediate period during which cholecystectomy is more difficult due to the predictable severity of inflammation, and the span of this unfavorable intermediate period is at a minimum between 10 days and 4 weeks; studies that classify surgeries during this period as delayed are not adequately "delayed", which biases results in favor of early cholecystectomy.

### Selective intraoperative cholangiography should be considered over routine intraoperative cholangiography during cholecystectomy: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111GKMcK]. Surgical Endoscopy (2022). Medium credibility.

Implications for practice

A selective approach to IOC may be appropriate. Selective IOC combined with measures that aid prevention of BDI (e.g. critical view of safety, fundus-first approach, multi-port laparoscopic technique, and low threshold for conversion to open cholecystectomy) and together with investigations that detect bile duct stone perioperatively (e.g. abdominal ultrasound, laparoscopic ultrasound, endoscopic ultrasound, and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography) should be considered.

Implications for research

No uniform indication system for selective IOC has been developed. Such an indication system should consider the risk factors for BDI (e.g. sex, age, experience of surgeons, prolonged laparoscopic cholecystectomy, and indication for cholecystectomy) and the possible presence (based on clinical, laboratory, and imaging findings) and available treatment of biliary stones. Future studies are needed to establish a standard indication system based on which surgeons perform IOC.

Several authors state that BDI cannot be examined with randomized trials due to its low incidence; high-quality prospective studies which also consider the presence of potential biases and confounding factors are therefore needed.

In conclusion, selective IOC may not be inferior to routine IOC in preventing BDI. IOC might not be indicated in every case, and its selective use may stand as an alternative to routine policy, however, the evidence is very uncertain. Further good quality research is required to address this question and to determine the exact selection criteria for IOC.

### Nineteen-year trends in incidence and indications for laparoscopic cholecystectomy: the NY state experience [^114Yac8A]. Surgical Endoscopy (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Since the introduction of laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC), there has been continued evolution in technique, instrumentation and postoperative management. With increased experience, LC has migrated to the outpatient setting. We asked whether increased availability and experience has impacted incidence of and indications for LC.

Methods

The New York (NY) State Planning and Research Cooperative System longitudinal administrative database was utilized to identify patients who underwent cholecystectomy between 1995 and 2013. ICD-9 and CPT procedure codes were extracted corresponding to laparoscopic and open cholecystectomy and the associated primary diagnostic codes. Data were analyzed as relative change in incidence (normalized to 1000 LC patients) for respective diagnoses.

Results

From 1995 to 2013, 711,406 cholecystectomies were performed in NY State: 637,308 (89.58%) laparoscopic. The overall frequency of cholecystectomy did not increase (1.23% increase with a commensurate population increase of 6.32%). Indications for LC during this time were: 72.81% for calculous cholecystitis (n = 464,032), 4.88% for biliary colic (n = 31,124), 8.98% for acalculous cholecystitis (n = 57,205), 3.01% for gallstone pancreatitis (n = 19,193), and 1.59% for biliary dyskinesia (n = 10,110). The incidence of calculous cholecystitis declined (-20.09%, p < 0.0001) between 1995 and 2013; meanwhile, other diagnoses increased in incidence: biliary colic (+54.96%, p = 0.0013), acalculous cholecystitis (+94.24%, p < 0.0001), gallstone pancreatitis (+107.48%, p < 0.0001), and biliary dyskinesia (+331.74%, p < 0.0001). Outpatient LC incidence catapulted to 48.59% in 2013, from 0.15% in 1995, increasing > 320-fold. Analysis of LC through 2014 revealed increasing rates of digestive, infectious, respiratory, and renal complications, with overall cholecystectomy complication rates of 9.29%.

Conclusion

A shifting distribution of operative indications and increasing rates of complications should prompt careful consideration prior to surgery for benign biliary disease. For what is a common procedure, LC carries substantial risk of complications, thus requiring the patient to be an active participant and to share in the decision-making process.

### The difficult cholecystectomy: what you need to know [^113DeaCT]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

This review discusses the grading of cholecystitis, the optimal timing of cholecystectomy, adopting a culture of safe cholecystectomy, understanding the common error traps that can lead to intraoperative complications, and how to avoid them. 1–28 The Tokyo Guidelines, American Association for the Surgery of Trauma, Nassar, and Parkland scoring systems are discussed. The patient factors, physiologic status, and operative findings that predict a difficult cholecystectomy or conversion from laparoscopic to open cholecystectomy are reviewed. With laparoscopic expertise and patient conditions that are not prohibitive, early laparoscopic cholecystectomy is recommended. This is ideally within 72 hours of admission but supported up to the seventh hospital day. The majority of bile duct injuries are due to misidentification of normal anatomy. Strasberg's four error traps and the zones of danger to avoid during a cholecystectomy are described. The review emphasizes the importance of a true critical view of safety for identification of the anatomy. In up to 15% of operations for acute cholecystitis, a critical view of safety cannot be achieved safely. Recognizing these conditions and changing your operative strategy are mandatory to avoid harm. The principles to follow for a safe cholecystectomy are discussed in detail. The cardinal message of this review is, "under challenging conditions, bile duct injuries can be minimized via either a subtotal cholecystectomy or top-down cholecystectomy if dissection in the hepatocystic triangle is avoided". 21 The most severe biliary/vascular injuries usually occur after conversion from laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Indications and techniques for bailout procedures including the fenestrating and reconstituting subtotal cholecystectomy are presented. Seven percent to 10% of cholecystectomies for acute cholecystitis currently result in subtotal cholecystectomy. Level of evidence: III.

### Early versus delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy for biliary colic [^117SwVS9]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Biliary colic is one of the commonest indications for laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy involves several months of waiting if performed electively. However, patients can develop life-threatening complications during this waiting period.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of early versus delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy for patients with biliary colic due to gallstones.

Search Strategy

We searched The Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register, The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Science Citation Index Expanded until March 2008.

Selection Criteria

We included only randomised clinical trials irrespective of language and publication status.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently extracted the data. We intended to calculate the risk ratio, risk difference with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes, and weighted mean difference (WMD) with 95% CI for continuous outcomes using RevMan 4.2 based on intention-to-treat analysis.

Main Results

Only one trial including 75 patients, randomised to early laparoscopic cholecystectomy (less than 24 hours of diagnosis) (n = 35) and delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy (mean waiting period of 4.2 months) (n = 40), qualified for this review. This trial was of high risk of bias. During the waiting period in the delayed group (mean 4.2 months), the complications that the patients suffered included severe acute pancreatitis resulting in mortality (1), empyema of gallbladder (1), gallbladder perforation (1), acute cholecystitis (2), cholangitis (2), obstructive jaundice (2), and recurrent biliary colic requiring hospital visits (5). The rate of conversion to open cholecystectomy was lower in the early group (0%) than the delayed group (8/40 or 20%) (p = 0.0172). There was a statistically significant shorter operating time and hospital stay in the early group than the delayed group (WMD -14.80 minutes, 95% CI -18.02 to -11.58 and -1.25 days, 95% CI -2.05 to -0.45 respectively). Fourteen patients (35%) required 18 hospital admissions for symptoms related to gallstones during the mean waiting period of 4.2 months in the delayed group. This is equivalent to 11 admissions per 100 persons per month.

Authors' Conclusions

Based on evidence from only one high-bias risk trial, it appears that early laparoscopic cholecystectomy (< 24 hours of diagnosis of biliary colic) decreases the morbidity during the waiting period for elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy, decreases the rate of conversion to open cholecystectomy, decreases operating time, and decreases hospital stay. Further randomised clinical trials are necessary to confirm or refute this finding.

### SAGES guidelines for the clinical application of laparoscopic biliary tract surgery [^111iBjXP]. Surgical Endoscopy (2010). Medium credibility.

Reduced port and single incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy — All parts of the SAGES GUIDELINES FOR THE CLINICAL APPLICATION OF LAPAROSCOPIC BILIARY TRACT SURGERY apply to reduced port and single incision approaches to laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The indications, contra-indications and preoperative preparation for reduced port and single incision approaches are the same as those for multi port cholecystectomy, and access and equipment, are, in their essentials, the same for reduced port and single incision approaches and multiport procedures. Access to the abdominal cavity in reduced port and single incision approaches should follow accepted standards for safe entry including avoidance and recognition of complications, and standard instruments may be used in single incision or multi port procedures. With respect to specialized access devices and non-rigid instruments, there have been no trials or adequate evaluative studies yet published to offer any recommendation for these devices, and introduction of new instruments, access devices or new techniques should be done with caution and/or under study protocol; prior to the addition of any new instrument or device, it should, to the extent possible, be proven safe, and not limit adherence to established guidelines for safe performance of laparoscopic cholecystectomy, with adequate training obtained prior to utilization in a patient. As with any new technique, outcomes should be continuously assessed to ensure continued patient safety as single incision techniques are developed; to date, only studies with limited numbers of patients have been reported. Dissection performed during single incision procedures should follow "best practice" approaches recommended for multiport cholecystectomy including dynamic traction of the fundus of the gallbladder, dynamic lateral retraction of the gallbladder infundibulum, and identification and maintenance of the "critical view" of the cystic duct and artery to avoid inadvertent injury to the common bile duct or hepatic arteries; during initial procedures, a low threshold for using additional port sites should be maintained so as to not jeopardize a safe dissection and result.

### Persistent and de novo symptoms after cholecystectomy: a systematic review of cholecystectomy effectiveness [^116jeQSX]. Surgical Endoscopy (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Cholecystectomy is the preferred treatment option for symptomatic gallstones, but the exact relationship between cholecystectomies and symptoms still is unclear. This study aimed to assess the effectiveness of elective cholecystectomy for patients with cholecystolithiasis in terms of both persistent and de novo symptoms.

Methods

A systematic literature search was conducted in Pubmed and Embase. The search included studies comprising patients 18 years of age or older undergoing elective cholecystectomy for symptomatic cholecystolithiasis. The proportions of symptoms after cholecystectomy were calculated and then subdivided into persistent and de novo symptoms.

Results

A total of 38 studies reported the presence of postcholecystectomy symptoms. The results showed that upper abdominal pain, the main indication for cholecystectomy in the majority of the patients, mostly disappeared after surgery. However, it persisted in up to 33% of the patients and arose de novo in up to 14%. Diarrhea (85%) and constipation (76%) were the persistent symptoms most often reported, whereas upper abdominal pain and vomiting were the least often reported. Flatulence (62%) was the most often reported new symptom. However, large variations in symptoms were found between studies.

Conclusions

The review indicates that cholecystectomy often is ineffective with regard to persistent and de novo symptoms. The finding that the types and proportions of persistent symptoms differ from those that arise de novo suggests that this distinction may be useful in predicting which patients would and which would not benefit from a cholecystectomy.

### ACG clinical guideline: perioperative risk assessment and management in patients with cirrhosis [^11363sjb]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Cholecystectomy in cirrhosis — prevalence, indications, and alternatives are as follows: Cholelithiasis is approximately 2-fold more prevalent in cirrhosis, and patients with asymptomatic cholelithiasis should not be treated. In Child–Turcotte–Pugh (CTP) A and B cirrhosis, indications for elective cholecystectomy are the same as in noncirrhotic patients, and laparoscopic cholecystectomy remains the procedure of choice. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is generally safe in CTP A and B but is associated with significantly higher postoperative complications and mortality in CTP class C. For acute cholecystitis, antibiotics and cholecystostomy are the standard of care. When concern or uncertainty exists, perioperative mortality estimation using the VOCAL-Penn score may help decision-making, and for prohibitive surgical risk, antibiotics with percutaneous cholecystostomy, transpapillary drainage, or endoscopic ultrasound-guided transmural gallbladder drainage are alternatives.

### Cost-effectiveness of a new strategy to identify uncomplicated gallstone disease patients that will benefit from a cholecystectomy [^113uiSHj]. Surgical Endoscopy (2017). Low credibility.

Gallstones constitute a significant health problem in developed societies, affecting 5–22% of the adult population, but only an estimated 13–22% of gallstone carriers will eventually become symptomatic. The diagnosis of uncomplicated symptomatic gallstone disease is based on the Rome III criteria consisting of a steady abdominal pain, usually located in epigastrium and/or right upper quadrant lasting 30 min or longer in the presence of radiologically detected gallstones. However, the sensitivity of these criteria is limited and 40% of the patients with symptomatic gallstones report far less specific abdominal pain symptoms.

A cholecystectomy is the therapy of first choice for patients diagnosed with uncomplicated symptomatic cholecystolithiasis. There are no international guidelines that indicate which patient to offer a cholecystectomy or conservative treatment. Therefore, the indication to perform a cholecystectomy lies within the surgeons' preference leading to variations in practice and consequently unnecessary cholecystectomies. Annually, approximately 800,000 cholecystectomies are performed in the United States alone and the costs are estimated to be $6 billion. Other developed countries show similar patterns of care. A systematic review reported in this journal demonstrated that up to 33% of patients have persistent abdominal pain following cholecystectomy.

A strategy that is effective in selecting patients with abdominal pain and gallstones for surgery most likely to benefit from a cholecystectomy was developed. This strategy uses fixed selection criteria based on pain characteristics that are easy to use in clinical practice. Patients with abdominal pain and gallstones are selected for cholecystectomy if they fulfill one of the following two selection criteria: (1) episodic pain and (2) pain onset of 1 year or less before the outpatient clinic visit. Preoperative identification of patients with abdominal pain and gallstones who will benefit from a cholecystectomy from patients who will not will probably lead to more effective use of cholecystectomies, fewer surgery-related complications, and fewer unnecessary healthcare expenses. We performed a model-based economic evaluation to evaluate a strategy based on fixed criteria for selecting patients for a cholecystectomy against current practice.

Conclusion

The diagnostic evaluation and treatment of patients with gallbladder stones and abdominal pain are subject to change. The symptom criteria for symptomatic cholecystolithiasis differ across international guidelines. Although biliary colic is frequently resolved after cholecystectomy, non-biliary symptoms persist in up to 40 per cent of patients. This review guides surgeons on how to tailor diagnosis and treatment in patients with symptomatic cholecystolithiasis.

### Acute cholecystitis: WSES position statement [^114HXLyF]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

The literature about the treatment of acute calculous cholecystitis has been recently examined in more than one Consensus Conference. The disease could present with a picture ranging from mild, self-limiting, to a potentially life-threatening illness, and the severity of inflammation and its life-threatening potential is also strongly determined by the general condition of the patient. The degree of inflammation of the gallbladder and the conditions of patients with their co-morbidities contribute to indicate the best therapeutic option for every single patient. However, such heterogeneity makes very difficult to standardize a therapeutic protocol for this condition.

The optimal surgical treatment for acute cholecystitis should be examined according to its severity; however, no uniform grading system is yet available, and the need for practical patient-related operative guidelines has been stressed elsewhere.

Even the evidences about the outcome of the therapeutic procedures adopted are difficult to evaluate in this heterogeneous context; studies available have not generally examined the optimal treatment for acute cholecystitis according to its severity. A systematic review of the literature must take into consideration this aspect.

The literature review has been presented to the 2nd World Society for Emergency Surgery held in Bergamo in July 2013. This position paper follows the indication emerged in that meeting.

Because the low incidence of bile duct injury (BDI) at any one institution and the absence of national registries for tracking BDI makes the study of this problem and efforts to impact it challenging, and current observational studies are underpowered with limited generalizability as most originate from single institutions and/or report sample sizes too small to adequately detect BDI, the development of national quality improvement initiatives for the identification and tracking of BDIs after cholecystectomy should be one of the most important steps taken going forward.

### Safe cholecystectomy multi-society practice guideline and state of the art consensus conference on prevention of bile duct injury during cholecystectomy [^113ysqmc]. Annals of Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

BDI is the most common serious complication of laparoscopic cholecystectomy. To address this problem, a multi-society consensus conference was held to develop evidenced-based recommendations for safe cholecystectomy and prevention of BDI.

Methods

Literature reviews were conducted for 18 key questions across 6 broad topics around cholecystectomy directed by a steering group and subject experts from 5 surgical societies (Society of Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons, Americas Hepato-Pancreato-Biliary Association, International Hepato-Pancreato-Biliary Association, Society for Surgery of the Alimentary Tract, and European Association for Endoscopic Surgery). Evidence-based recommendations were formulated using the grading of recommendations assessment, development, and evaluation methodology. When evidence-based recommendations could not be made, expert opinion was documented. A number of recommendations for future research were also documented. Recommendations were presented at a consensus meeting in October 2018 and were voted on by an international panel of 25 experts with greater than 80% agreement considered consensus.

Results

Consensus was reached on 17 of 18 questions by the guideline development group and expert panel with high concordance from audience participation. Most recommendations were conditional due to low certainty of evidence. Strong recommendations were made for (1) use of intraoperative biliary imaging for uncertainty of anatomy or suspicion of biliary injury; and (2) referral of patients with confirmed or suspected BDI to an experienced surgeon/multispecialty hepatobiliary team.

Conclusions

These consensus recommendations should provide guidance to surgeons, training programs, hospitals, and professional societies for strategies that have the potential to reduce BDIs and positively impact patient outcomes. Development of clinical and educational research initiatives based on these recommendations may drive further improvement in the quality of surgical care for patients undergoing cholecystectomy.

### 2020 World Society of Emergency Surgery updated guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of acute calculus cholecystitis [^113GfcMy]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The estimated overall prevalence of gallstones is 10–15% in the general population, with some differences across countries. Between 20 and 40% of patients with gallstones will develop gallstone-related complications, with an incidence of 1–3% annually; acute calculus cholecystitis (ACC) is the first clinical presentation in 10–15% of the cases. Cholecystectomy is the most common therapeutic approach for ACC and is considered the standard of care for gallstone disease for the majority of patients. However, considering the heterogeneity of clinical scenarios, the variability in hospital facilities and in the availability of expertise, the management of patients with right upper quadrant abdominal pain may vary.

In 2016, the World Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES) published the first edition of their guidelines for ACC, which presented different diagnostic and therapeutic algorithms, compared with the Tokyo Guidelines (TG), known at that time as Tokyo Guidelines 2013 (TG13). In particular, the direct link between diagnostic criteria for ACC, severity classification and therapeutic indications described in the TG13 are limited by lack of quality evidence. The approach of the WSES guidelines was to simplify the initial management of patients presenting with suspected ACC. The literature review, the discussion of the relevant evidence and the statements made during the consensus conference (CC) held in Jerusalem in 2015 (Third WSES International Congress) supported surgery as the gold standard treatment for all patients with ACC, with two exceptions: patients who refuse surgery, and patients for whom surgery would be considered as 'very high risk', although no clear consensus was reached on this second issue. Moreover, the 2016 WSES Guidelines on ACC included discussions on unclear areas, such as diagnosis, evaluation of the surgical risk and appropriate management of associated common bile duct stones (CBDS).

### Does the frequency of cholecystectomy affect the ensuing incidence of gallbladder cancer in Sweden? A population-based study with a 16-year coverage [^1165WZGr]. World Journal of Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Gallbladder cancer (GBC) is rare among the different gastrointestinal cancers with a significant global variation in incidence. High cholecystectomy rates on benign indications have been assumed to prevent the development of gallbladder cancer. The aim of the present study was to explore the relationship between the rate of cholecystectomy at different time periods and regions of the country and the annual incidence of GBC.

Methods

Standardized cholecystectomy and GBC incidences for Swedish counties have been obtained from the Swedish national inpatient and National Cancer registries for the years 1998–2013. The incidences have been calculated for ages over 15 years and per 100,000 population. The relationships between cholecystectomy and GBC incidences have been analyzed using regression models. Correlation analyses were performed for the total cumulative incidence rates as well as the incidence rates calculated for the first and last 8 years of the entire study period.

Results

Cholecystectomy rates ranged from 99 to 205 per 100,000 and year, and the GBC incidence from 2.3 to 5.1. Overall, we observed a slow but steady decline in cholecystectomy rates — as well as GBC incidences during the 16-year period. No significant correlation between the cholecystectomy rates and GBC incidences was seen.

Conclusions

This nationwide population-based study demonstrates substantial geographic differences in annual cholecystectomy rates without any significant inverse co-variation between cholecystectomy rates and the ensuing GBC incidence which would have supported the idea that frequent cholecystectomy affects the incidence of GBC.

### 2019 WSES guidelines for the management of severe acute pancreatitis [^112hV9m8]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Statements (timing of cholecystectomy)

Laparoscopic cholecystectomy during index admission is recommended in mild acute gallstone pancreatitis (1A).
When ERCP and sphincterotomy are performed during the index admission, the risk for recurrent pancreatitis is diminished, but same admission cholecystectomy is still advised since there is an increased risk for other biliary complications (1B).
In acute gallstone pancreatitis with peripancreatic fluid collections, cholecystectomy should be deferred until fluid collections resolve or stabilize and acute inflammation ceases (2C).

Discussion

Two different systematic reviews state that index admission cholecystectomy for mild AGP is safe. In order to decrease the length of stay and the overall costs, cholecystectomy may be performed as early as the second hospital day, as long as the patient is clinically improving. Routine intraoperative cholangiography seems to be unnecessary in patients with mild gallstone pancreatitis and normalizing bilirubin levels. If ERCP was performed during the index admission, the risk for recurrent biliary events, especially recurrent AGP, was diminished but still higher than same-admission cholecystectomy. A multicenter RCT with 266 patients concluded that interval cholecystectomy resulted in more gallstone-related complications, especially recurrent pancreatitis and colics, without increased cholecystectomy-related complications. There is a single retrospective study of timing of cholecystectomy in patients with moderate to severe AGP with peripancreatic fluid collections. This study reported more complications after early cholecystectomy.

Open abdomen

Questions
Which are the indications for open abdomen in case of severe acute pancreatitis?
What is the best temporary abdominal closure system for open abdomen?
What is the correct timing for dressing changes?
What is the correct timing for abdominal closure?

Statements (open abdomen)

In patients with severe acute pancreatitis unresponsive to conservative management of IAH/ACS, surgical decompression and use of open abdomen are effective in treating the abdominal compartment syndrome (2C).
We suggest that clinicians should be cautious not to over-resuscitate patients with early SAP and measure intra-abdominal pressure regularly (1C).
We suggest that the open abdomen (OA) be avoided if other strategies can be used to mitigate or treat severe intra-abdominal hypertension in SAP (1C).
We recommend not to utilize the OA after necrosectomy for SAP (unless severe IAH mandates OA as a mandatory procedure) (1C).
We recommend not to debride or undertake early necrosectomy if forced to undertake an early OA due abdominal compartment syndrome or visceral ischemia (1A).

### 2020 World Society of Emergency Surgery updated guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of acute calculus cholecystitis [^115MsxNQ]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute calculus cholecystitis (ACC) has a high incidence in the general population. The presence of several areas of uncertainty, along with the availability of new evidence, prompted the current update of the 2016 WSES (World Society of Emergency Surgery) Guidelines on ACC.

Materials and Methods

The WSES president appointed four members as a scientific secretariat, four members as an organization committee and four members as a scientific committee, choosing them from the expert affiliates of WSES. Relevant key questions were constructed, and the task force produced drafts of each section based on the best scientific evidence from PubMed and EMBASE Library; recommendations were developed in order to answer these key questions. The quality of evidence and strength of recommendations were reviewed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) criteria (see https://www.gradeworkinggroup.org/). All the statements were presented, discussed and voted upon during the Consensus Conference at the 6th World Congress of the World Society of Emergency Surgery held in Nijmegen (NL) in May 2019. A revised version of the statements was voted upon via an online questionnaire until consensus was reached.

Results

The pivotal role of surgery is confirmed, including in high-risk patients. When compared with the WSES 2016 guidelines, the role of gallbladder drainage is reduced, despite the considerable technical improvements available. Early laparoscopic cholecystectomy (ELC) should be the standard of care whenever possible, even in subgroups of patients who are considered fragile, such as the elderly; those with cardiac disease, renal disease and cirrhosis; or those who are generally at high risk for surgery. Subtotal cholecystectomy is safe and represents a valuable option in cases of difficult gallbladder removal.

Conclusions, Knowledge Gaps and Research Recommendations

ELC has a central role in the management of patients with ACC. The value of surgical treatment for high-risk patients should lead to a distinction between high-risk patients and patients who are not suitable for surgery. Further evidence on the role of clinical judgement and the use of clinical scores as adjunctive tools to guide treatment of high-risk patients and patients who are not suitable for surgery is required. The development of local policies for safe laparoscopic cholecystectomy is recommended.

Inflammation phases — timing windows and expected favorability for cholecystectomy are outlined as follows: Phase 2 spans 72 hours to 10 days and is expected to be less favorable for cholecystectomy due to tissue swelling and increased vascularity; Phase 3 spans 10 days to 6 weeks and is expected to be much less favorable for cholecystectomy with acute and chronic inflammation; Phase 4 is 6 weeks or later and is expected to be more favorable again for cholecystectomy with predominately chronic inflammation. There is also some justification for a period greater than 12 weeks but there is very little information in the literature that this time period had been the subject of study.

### Open cholecystectomy in the laparoscopic era [^113xEUkd]. The British Journal of Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Introduction

As techniques in laparoscopic cholecystectomy have improved, surgeon experience of open cholecystectomy may be limited. This study examined the current indications for and techniques used in primary open cholecystectomy.

Methods

Some 3100 consecutive patients undergoing elective or emergency cholecystectomy over a 5-year interval were identified from a prospective surgical audit database. Demographic, diagnostic and procedural data were examined.

Results

There were 123 (4.0 per cent) primary and 219 (7.4 per cent) converted open cholecystectomies. Some 48.0 and 45.6 per cent of patients in the primary open cholecystectomy and converted groups respectively were men, compared with 24.0 per cent of 2758 who had a successful laparoscopic procedure. Primary open cholecystectomy was employed principally for previous upper abdominal open surgery (22.7 per cent) and emergency operation for general peritonitis (19.5 per cent). The fundus-first approach was employed in 53.7 per cent of primary open procedures and 53.0 per cent of conversions, with subtotal excision in 4.9 and 13.2 per cent respectively.

Conclusion

Primary open cholecystectomy remains a common procedure in the treatment of gallbladder disease despite the success of laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Successful outcome in difficult cases requires familiarity with specific techniques, exposure to which may be limited in current training programmes.

SAGES laparoscopic biliary surgery guidelines — gallstone pancreatitis: Acute pancreatitis caused by gallstones is an important indication for cholecystectomy, and its incidence due to gallstones appears to be increasing. One large state's discharge data showed one-third of adult cases are caused by gallstones, with an incidence of gallstone pancreatitis of approximately 14.5 per 100,000, translating into 31,500 cases per year nationally. While laparoscopic cholecystectomy is preferred to remove the source of stones, the timing of cholecystectomy and of procedures to evaluate and clear common bile duct stones remain controversial, particularly in mild, self-limited disease. There is agreement that severe pancreatitis with ongoing multi system organ failure requires immediate clearing of any biliary obstruction, usually with ERCP.

### Liver transplantation for bile duct injury after open and laparoscopic cholecystectomy [^112vixyh]. The British Journal of Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

The incidence of bile duct injury (BDI) during open cholecystectomy is between 0.1 and 0.3 per cent. With the introduction of laparoscopic cholecystectomy, the incidence rose to 1–2 per cent before stabilizing at 0.3–0.6 per cent–. BDI is a severe and potentially life-threatening complication of cholecystectomy. Liver transplantation (LT) is the final treatment option for patients who develop acute liver failure or secondary biliary cirrhosis resulting in chronic liver failure.

Most studies on LT for BDI after cholecystectomy have reported on a small number of patients. The largest studyincluded only 13 patients. Although these publications provide important insights, controversy still exists regarding the indications for LT in patients with acute liver failure. In addition, no study has compared LT for BDI after open versus laparoscopic cholecystectomy. This study aimed to review indications and outcome of LT for BDI after open and laparoscopic cholecystectomy in Spain.

### Laparoscopic cholecystectomy… [^114fyNWi]. JAMA Network (2018). Excellent credibility.

Bile is fluid made by the liver and released into the small intestine to help digestion. Changes in bile concentration and composition caused by changes in diet, hormones, medications, or rapid weight loss or weight gain can result in formation of solid pieces of bile called gallstones. In the United States, more than 6 million men and 14 million women have had gallstone disease, with higher rates in Native and Hispanic Americans. A small portion of people with gallstones may experience occasional abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting, often after meals. Gallstones can sometimes migrate out of the gallbladder, block the normal flow of bile, and lead to inflammation and infection of the gallbladder. This is called cholecystitis and can cause sharp, constant abdominal pain, fever, nausea, and vomiting. These symptoms warrant a visit to a physician, who can arrange for an ultrasound and make a referral to a surgeon if appropriate.

Gallstones do not need to be treated if they are not causing problems. Patients who have cholecystitis or are bothered by symptoms of gallstones are treated with surgical removal of the gallbladder, known as cholecystectomy. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy, also known as minimally invasive cholecystectomy, is performed through 4 small incisions with use of a camera to visualize the inside of the abdomen and long tools to remove the gallbladder. Surgery is done under anesthesia, and patients are asleep throughout the entire procedure. Most patients go home on the day of or the day after surgery. Patients can return to eating their usual meals at home. Mild to moderate pain is common for a few days and can be managed with pain medications as prescribed. Dressings on the incisions can typically be removed the day after surgery, at which time patients can resume regular showers, but some incisions may require special care as instructed by the surgeon.

A few people may experience diarrhea after cholecystectomy, which goes away after a few weeks or months in most people. These symptoms can also be caused by a gallstone that is left behind in the bile duct. Bleeding from a blood vessel near the gallbladder can sometimes occur. Most bleeding stops on its own, but rarely, persistent bleeding requires intervention. After cholecystectomy, patients who experience worsening pain, fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, or jaundice should see a doctor.

### Laparoscopic cholecystectomy vs open cholecystectomy in the treatment of acute cholecystitis… [^1156nfLT]. JAMA Network (1998). Excellent credibility.

Patients One hundred fourteen patients underwent LC, and 110 underwent OC. The patients underwent surgery within 72 hours of the onset of symptoms. The patients were selected for LC or OC depending on the surgeon's experience in laparoscopic surgery. Main Outcome Measures Operating time, rate of conversion from LC to OC, complications, and length of hospital stay. Results Conversion from LC to OC was necessary in 15% of the patients. The mean operating time was 77 minutes for the OC group and 88 minutes for the LC group. Complications occurred in 14% of the patients in the LC group and in 23% of the patients in the OC group, with no significant differences between the 2 groups. The number of moderate or severe complications was similar in both groups, whereas mild complications were more common in the OC group. The length of the hospital stay averaged 8. 1 days for the OC group and
3. 3 days for the LC group.

Conclusions Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is a safe, valid alternative to OC in patients with acute cholecystitis. The technique has a low rate of complications, implies a shorter hospital stay, and offers the patient a more comfortable postoperative period than OC. Patients in whom choledocholithiasis was diagnosed preoperatively were excluded from the study. Age, sex, and operative findings are shown in Table 1. An antibiotic and antithrombotic prophylaxis was performed during the preoperative period and continued until 24 to 48 hours postoperatively. All the patients underwent surgery within 72 hours of the onset of symptoms. The patients underwent LC when the surgeon responsible had experience in laparoscopic surgery. The surgical technique used for OCs in all patients was a subcostal incision with removal of adhesions plus cholecystectomy.

Cholecystectomy was performed in 100% of the patients. Intraoperative cholangiography was performed in 72 of the 114 patients who underwent LC and in 79 of the 110 patients who underwent OC, revealing 2 cases of choledocholithiasis in the former and 1 in the latter.

### Surgical treatment for asymptomatic cholelithiasis… [^113KdHCe]. AAFP (2014). Low credibility.

Clinical Question When is surgery indicated in patients with asymptomatic cholelithiasis. Evidence-Based Answer Surgery should not be offered to patients with asymptomatic cholelithiasis. Cholecystectomy may be beneficial for patients who are at high risk of biliary cancer, infection, or other complications, including younger patients and those with choledocholithiasis, sickle cell disease, gallstones larger than 3 cm, or significant immunosuppression. 1 Compared with emergent cholecystectomy, elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy has lower rates of complications and conversion to open cholecystectomy. Case series and cohort studies indicate that complications of laparoscopic cholecystectomy — although rare — include potentially severe bleeding, abscess, bile leak, common bile duct injury, and bowel injury. 6, 7. Patients who are at high risk of biliary cancer and other operative or disease-related complications may be offered prophylactic cholecystectomy if the benefits of surgery outweigh the risks of observation. 1, 5, 9 Patients with asymptomatic choledocholithiasis have a much higher risk of severe complications and should be offered prophylactic cholecystectomy. 1 All patients should be counseled about the symptoms of biliary colic, because most severe gallstone-related complications are preceded by these symptoms.

1. Recommendations from Others A 1992 consensus statement from the National Institutes of Health, 9 updated by the Society of American Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons in 2010, 10 recommends that almost no asymptomatic patients undergo cholecystectomy.

Those at high risk of gallbladder cancer, myocardial infarction, and other complications — especially patients with sickle cell disease or hereditary spherocytosis, children, and those receiving immunosuppressive therapy or undergoing transplant — may benefit from surgery.
