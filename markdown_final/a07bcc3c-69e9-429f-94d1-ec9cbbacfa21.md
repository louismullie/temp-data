## Question

should i screen for breast cancer in a 30 yo?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether a 30-year-old woman should be screened for breast cancer, and if so, how to approach it based on current evidence and guidelines. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to define "average risk" versus "high risk" in a 30-year-old. Then, I should verify what major guidelines say about screening at age 30 for average-risk women. Next, I will examine the evidence base for benefits and harms of screening in this age group, including radiation risk and overdiagnosis. After that, I need to consider special high-risk scenarios where earlier or different modalities are appropriate. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk-stratified recommendation and counseling approach, making sure I double-check any conflicting statements before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the risk categories, because screening recommendations hinge on this distinction. Average risk generally means no personal history of breast cancer, no known pathogenic BRCA1/2 or other high-penetrance mutations, and no history of chest irradiation between ages 10–30. High risk includes BRCA carriers, untested first-degree relatives of BRCA carriers, women with ≥ 20% lifetime risk by validated models, and those with prior chest radiation, and these groups follow different pathways for early detection [^117EnmYo] [^112XjL5Y] [^112AewdP].

> Now, I should verify what the major guidelines say for average-risk 30-year-olds. The USPSTF recommends biennial screening mammography for ages 40–74 and does not recommend screening before 40 for average-risk women; there is insufficient evidence for screening at age 30, which aligns with the NCI's conclusion that there is no evidence of benefit for screening mammography in average-risk women younger than 40 years [^111v445a] [^1118jtiu]. Hold on, I should verify whether any society deviates here; ACOG and ACS similarly anchor routine screening to age 40 or later for average risk, reinforcing that screening at 30 is not advised in this group [^11263qBB] [^112SjnVL].

> Next, I will examine the evidence for benefits in women under 40. Wait, let me verify the mortality signal by age: randomized trials show a mortality reduction for women invited to screening in their 40s, but the benefit is smaller and less certain than in older women, and there are no randomized data demonstrating mortality benefit for average-risk women in their 30s. Modeling and trial syntheses consistently show no net benefit at age 30 for average-risk populations [^112EdHFZ] [^1118jtiu] [^114Zj8t1]. I should double-check the incidence context: the 5-year absolute risk at ages 30–34 is about 0.1% with an incidence of roughly 27 per 100,000, underscoring the low pretest probability and limited absolute benefit potential at this age [^117JozPe].

> I need to ensure I weigh harms appropriately because they can outweigh small benefits in low-incidence groups. Younger women have higher recall and false-positive rates, and starting earlier increases cumulative false positives and biopsies; modeling suggests that beginning at 40 increases false positives by about 60% versus starting at 50, and extrapolating that pattern implies even greater relative increases if screening were to start at 30, with a meaningful risk of overdiagnosis of indolent lesions [^114S3M89] [^1112qd1c]. But wait, what about radiation? Annual screening from 30–39 is estimated to cause more radiation-induced breast cancer deaths than it prevents in average-risk women, reinforcing that the harm–benefit balance is unfavorable at this age [^114Zj8t1].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — there are important exceptions. For high-risk women, earlier and more intensive screening is appropriate: the ACR recommends annual MRI starting around 25–30 for BRCA carriers and those with ≥ 20% lifetime risk, with mammography/tomosynthesis added depending on the specific risk profile; this risk-adapted approach acknowledges the higher baseline incidence and the superior sensitivity of MRI in this setting [^112AewdP] [^112XjL5Y]. I should confirm the radiation trade-off here too; even in BRCA carriers, modeling suggests limited or no net benefit from mammography alone in the early 30s, which is why MRI-first strategies are favored to mitigate radiation while maximizing detection [^114ZJvt3].

> Let me consider other scenarios that might prompt earlier evaluation. Women with a strong family history but untested status, those with prior chest irradiation, or those with recognized genetic syndromes warrant risk assessment and may benefit from earlier initiation of MRI-based screening after genetic counseling; conversely, average-risk women should not be offered screening mammography at 30 outside of a trial, and clinical breast examination is not recommended for routine screening in asymptomatic average-risk women of any age [^113jtYxT] [^112AewdP] [^112SjnVL] [^1118jtiu]. I should double-check that shared decision-making is emphasized for borderline-risk situations; yes, guidelines consistently recommend individualized discussion when evidence is limited or when risk is intermediate [^114jW2nH].

> I will now synthesize the clinical recommendation. For a 30-year-old at average risk: do not recommend screening mammography. Instead, focus on risk assessment, breast self-awareness, and prompt evaluation of symptoms, with routine screening beginning at 40 if she remains average risk and shared decision-making if she requests earlier initiation in her 40s. For a 30-year-old at high risk: refer for genetic counseling, consider MRI-first screening starting at 25–30 depending on the specific risk factor, and layer in mammography/tomosynthesis as indicated by the risk category and age, recognizing that MRI provides the greatest sensitivity and avoids radiation exposure in the youngest high-risk women [^111v445a] [^112AewdP] [^117Lz4FM]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought some guidelines might endorse screening at 30 for everyone, but on review, even societies that support starting at 40 do not extend routine screening to age 30 for average-risk women, which corrects that initial assumption [^11263qBB] [^112SjnVL].

> Finally, I should confirm practical counseling points. Emphasize that breast cancer at 30 is uncommon, that screening at this age has not been shown to reduce mortality in average-risk women, and that early screening increases false positives and overdiagnosis. If the patient is high risk, explain that earlier, MRI-based surveillance is evidence-based and can be lifesaving, and arrange timely genetics referral and coordination with breast imaging specialists to implement the appropriate protocol [^1118jtiu] [^114S3M89] [^112AewdP].

Routine screening mammography is **not recommended** for average-risk women at age 30 because the incidence is low and the balance of benefits and harms is unfavorable [^1118jtiu] [^117JozPe] [^114Zj8t1]. Screening is reserved for **high-risk women** — such as those with BRCA mutations, strong family history, or prior chest radiation — who may benefit from earlier MRI or mammography [^112AewdP] [^112XjL5Y]. For average-risk women, emphasize breast self-awareness and clinical breast exams; if screening is pursued, use shared decision-making to discuss false positives, overdiagnosis, and radiation risks [^114jW2nH] [^114S3M89].

---

## Incidence and risk profile at age 30

Breast cancer incidence is low at age 30, with a 5-year absolute risk of 0.1% and an incidence of 26.8 per 100,000 in women aged 30–34 [^117JozPe]. Younger women also have denser breasts, which reduces mammography sensitivity and increases false positives [^notfound].

---

## Evidence and guidelines for screening at age 30

- **USPSTF**: No evidence supports routine screening before 40; insufficient for women ≥ 75 [^111v445a].
- **ACS**: Start at 45; consider 40–44 if desired; no routine screening at 30 [^112SjnVL].
- **ACOG**: Offer starting at 40; no routine screening at 30 [^11263qBB].
- **NCCN**: Annual mammography from 40; earlier only for high-risk [^111FpaD3].

---

## Benefits and harms of screening at age 30

### Benefits

Potential benefits include **early detection** of a small subset of cancers, but the absolute benefit is low at age 30 [^1118jtiu]. Mortality reduction is **unproven** because trials show no significant mortality reduction in this age group [^1118jtiu].

---

### Harms

- **False positives**: Higher recall and biopsy rates in younger women [^114S3M89].
- **Overdiagnosis**: Detection of indolent lesions unlikely to cause harm [^114v1HsV].
- **Radiation exposure**: Small but cumulative risk with repeated imaging [^114Zj8t1].

---

## High-risk populations warranting early screening

Certain women benefit from earlier screening; **high-risk groups** include:

| **Risk factor** | **Recommended screening** |
|-|-|
| BRCA1/2 mutation | Annual MRI from 25–30; add mammography at 30 [^112AewdP] [^117LahsN] |
| Strong family history | MRI and mammography 10 years before youngest affected relative, not before 30 [^117LahsN] |
| Prior chest radiation | MRI and mammography 8 years after radiation, not before 25 [^117LahsN] [^112HQNt6] |
| Lifetime risk > 20% | MRI and mammography starting at 30 [^112HQNt6] [^114d4BVw] |

---

## Alternative screening methods

- **MRI**: Higher sensitivity, no radiation; for high-risk women [^112HQNt6].
- **Ultrasound**: Adjunct in dense breasts; limited standalone value [^113h9Q8y].
- **Clinical breast exam**: Consider every 1–3 years at 25–39; not routine [^1133i2kg].

---

## Current clinical practice and recommendations

Routine screening mammography is **not recommended** for average-risk women at 30; emphasize breast self-awareness and clinical breast exams [^117Lz4FM]. For high-risk women, use MRI and/or mammography starting at 25–30 based on risk [^112AewdP]. Use shared decision-making to discuss benefits, harms, and patient preferences [^114jW2nH].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Routine screening mammography is **not recommended** for average-risk women at age 30 due to low incidence, limited benefit, and meaningful harms. Screening should be reserved for high-risk women, with shared decision-making to align care with individual risk and preferences.

Breast Cancer Screening Key Points
- Tests are used to screen for different types of cancer when a person does not have symptoms.
- Mammography is the most common screening test for breast cancer.
- Magnetic resonance imaging may be used to screen women who have a high risk of breast cancer.
- Whether a woman should be screened for breast cancer and the screening test to use depends on certain factors.
- Other screening tests have been or are being studied in clinical trials.
- Breast exam
- Thermography
- Tissue sampling
- Ultrasound exam
- Screening tests for breast cancer are being studied in clinical trials. Mammography is the most common screening test for breast cancer. A mammogram is a picture of the inside of the breast. Mammography may find tumors that are too small to feel. It may also find ductal carcinoma in situ. In DCIS, abnormal cells line the breast duct, and in some women may become invasive breast cancer.

Many factors affect whether mammography is able to detect breast cancer:

- The age and weight of the patient.
- The size and type of tumor.
- Where the tumor has formed in the breast.
- How sensitive the breast tissue is to hormones.
- How dense the breast tissue is.
- The timing of the mammography within the woman's menstrual cycle.
- The quality of the mammogram picture.
- The skill of the radiologist in reading the mammogram. Women aged 50 to 69 years who have screening mammograms have a lower chance of dying from breast cancer than women who do not have screening mammograms. Fewer women are dying of breast cancer in the United States, but it is not known whether the lower risk of dying is because the cancer was found early by screening or whether the treatments were better.
- Older women who, if diagnosed with breast cancer through screening, will usually die of other causes.

Screening mammograms for those aged 66 to 79 years may find cancer in a very small percentage of women, but most of these cancers are low risk.
- In women with an average risk of developing breast cancer, screening mammography before age 40 has not shown any benefit.
- In women who are not expected to live for a long time and have other diseases or conditions, finding and treating early-stage breast cancer may reduce their quality of life without helping them live longer.

Breast cancer screening in women 75 years or older — burden and evidence gap: Breast cancer incidence remains high at 453.3 and 409.9 cases per 100 000 women aged 75 to 79 and 80 to 84 years, respectively, compared with 468.2 cases per 100 000 women aged 70 to 74 years; there are no randomized clinical trials of breast cancer screening including women 75 years or older, collaborative modeling predicted that screening in women 75 years or older is of benefit but a trial emulation found no benefit in women aged 75 to 84 years, and thus there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against screening mammography in women 75 years or older.

### Breast cancer screening: common questions and answers [^113AKxYP]. American Family Physician (2021). Medium credibility.

Breast cancer is the most common nonskin cancer in women and accounts for 30% of all new cancers in the United States. The highest incidence of breast cancer is in women 70 to 74 years of age. Numerous risk factors are associated with the development of breast cancer. A risk assessment tool can be used to determine individual risk and help guide screening decisions. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) and American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) recommend against teaching average-risk women to perform breast self-examinations. The USPSTF and AAFP recommend biennial screening mammography for average-risk women 50 to 74 years of age. However, there is no strong evidence supporting a net benefit of mammography screening in average-risk women 40 to 49 years of age; therefore, the USPSTF and AAFP recommend individualized decision-making in these women. For average-risk women 75 years and older, the USPSTF and AAFP conclude that there is insufficient evidence to recommend screening, but the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Cancer Society state that screening may continue depending on the woman's health status and life expectancy. Women at high risk of breast cancer may benefit from mammography starting at 30 years of age or earlier, with supplemental screening such as magnetic resonance imaging. Supplemental ultrasonography in women with dense breasts increases cancer detection but also false-positive results.

### Mammographic screening before age 50 years in the UK: comparison of the radiation risks with the mortality benefits [^114Zj8t1]. British Journal of Cancer (2005). Low credibility.

Mammographic screening before age 50 years is less effective than at older ages and the associated radiation risks are higher. We estimated how many breast cancer deaths could be caused and how many could be prevented by a decade of annual two-view mammographic screening starting at ages 20, 30 and 40 years, respectively, in the UK; for all women, and for women with first-degree relatives affected with breast cancer. We extrapolated from a radiation risk model to estimate the number of radiation-induced breast cancer deaths, and used results from randomised trials, which suggest a reduction in breast cancer mortality of 10–20% in women invited to screening before age 50 years, to estimate the number of deaths that could be prevented. The net change in breast cancer deaths was defined as the number of radiation-induced deaths minus the number of prevented deaths. For all women, assuming a reduction in mortality from screening of 20%, a decade of annual screening was estimated to induce more deaths than it prevents if started at age 20 years and at age 30 years (net increase = 0.86 and 0.37 breast cancer deaths, respectively, per 1000 women screened). The corresponding estimate for screening starting at age 40 years was a net decrease of 0.46 deaths/1000 women screened and a zero net change assuming a 10% mortality reduction. Results for women with first-degree relatives with breast cancer were generally in the same direction but, because their background incidence rates are higher, the net increases or decreases were greater. In conclusion, our estimates suggest that a decade of annual two-view mammographic screening before age 40 years would result in a net increase in breast cancer deaths, and that starting at age 40 years could result in a material net decrease only if breast cancer mortality is reduced by about 20% or more in women screened. Although these calculations were based on a number of uncertain parameters, in general, the conclusions were not altered when these parameters were varied within a feasible range.

Begin screening mammography by no later than age 50 years in females not initiated screening in their 40s. Make the decision about the age to begin mammography screening through a shared decision-making process taking into account information about the potential benefits and harms.

Breast cancer screening in women at average risk — research priorities include mammography screening with health outcomes for women aged 75 years and older. Additional priorities include comparative effectiveness trials of different screening modalities and screening intervals on health outcomes for women at various levels of breast cancer risk, evaluation of the impact of shared decision making on when to start and stop screening, examination of contributors to disparities in screening and barriers to follow-up care, and assessment of the effectiveness of education and engagement approaches to increase screening for patients at risk of health disparities.

### Evidence to support screening women in their 40s [^116yGJ2V]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

A large body of evidence demonstrates a 30% to 50% mortality benefit of screening mammography for women aged 40 to 49. Because of more rapid cancer growth rates in younger women, annual screening is more effective than biennial. Studies indicate that selective screening of women aged 40 to 49 would miss the majority of breast cancers. If implemented, recent US Preventive Services Task Force breast cancer screening guidelines, which recommend against routine screening of women in their 40s, could result in thousands of preventable breast cancer deaths per year. Vigilance is needed to safeguard younger women's access to screening mammography.

### Breast cancer in young women [^113uZqJH]. Nature Reviews: Clinical Oncology (2012). Medium credibility.

About one in 300 women will be diagnosed with breast cancer before the age of 40. Advances in screening have not had an impact on mortality in women who are too young to be candidates for screening. Risk factors for early breast cancer include a lean body habitus and recent use of an oral contraceptive. Breast cancers in very young women are typically aggressive, in part owing to the over-representation of high-grade, triple-negative tumours, but young age is an independent negative predictor of cancer-specific survival. Very early age-of-onset also correlates strongly with the risk of local recurrence and with the odds of contralateral breast cancer. Given the high risks of local and distant recurrence in young women with invasive breast cancer, most (if not all) young patients are candidates for chemotherapy. It is hoped that by increasing breast cancer awareness, the proportion of invasive breast cancers that are diagnosed at 2.0 cm or smaller will increase and that this will lead to a reduction in mortality.

### Decision-making regarding mammography screening for older women [^115CDdsy]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2016). Low credibility.

The population is aging, and breast cancer incidence increases with age, peaking between the ages of 75 and 79. However, it is not known whether mammography screening helps women aged 75 and older live longer because they have not been included in randomized controlled trials evaluating mammography screening. Guidelines recommend that older women with less than a 10-year life expectancy not be screened because it takes approximately 10 years before a screen-detected breast cancer may affect an older woman's survival. Guidelines recommend that clinicians discuss the benefits and risks of screening with women aged 75 and older with a life expectancy of 10 years or longer to help them elicit their values and preferences. It is estimated that two of 1,000 women who continue to be screened every other year from age 70 to 79 may avoid breast cancer death, but 12% to 27% of these women will experience a false-positive test, and 10% to 20% of women who experience a false-positive test will undergo a breast biopsy. In addition, approximately 30% of screen-detected cancers would not otherwise have shown up in an older woman's lifetime, yet nearly all older women undergo treatment for these breast cancers, and the risks of treatment increase with age. To inform decision-making, tools are available to estimate life expectancy and to educate older women about the benefits and harms of mammography screening. Guides are also available to help clinicians discuss stopping screening with older women with less than a 10-year life expectancy. Ideally, screening decisions would consider an older woman's life expectancy, breast cancer risk, and her values and preferences.

### Screening for breast cancer: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^111A6rZF]. JAMA (2024). Excellent credibility.

US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) breast cancer screening evidence assessment — Among all US women, breast cancer is the second most common cancer and the second most common cause of cancer death, and in 2023 an estimated 43 170 women died of breast cancer; the USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that biennial screening mammography in women aged 40 to 74 years has a moderate net benefit, and concludes that the evidence is insufficient to determine the balance of benefits and harms of screening mammography in women 75 years or older (I statement) and that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of supplemental screening for breast cancer using breast ultrasonography or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), regardless of breast density.

### Estimated risk of radiation-induced breast cancer from mammographic screening for young BRCA mutation carriers [^114ZJvt3]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2009). Low credibility.

BRCA mutation carriers are recommended to start mammographic screening for breast cancer as early as age 25–30 years. We used an excess relative risk model (based on a pooled analysis of three cohorts with 7600 subjects who received radiation exposure) to estimate the lifetime risk of radiation-induced breast cancer from five annual mammographic screenings in young (< 40 years) BRCA mutation carriers. We then estimated the reduction in breast cancer mortality required to outweigh the radiation risk. Breast cancer rates for mutation carriers were based on a pooled analysis of 22 pedigree studies with 8139 subjects. For BRCA1 mutation carriers, the estimated lifetime risk of radiation-induced breast cancer mortality per 10,000 women resulting from annual mammography was 26 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 14 to 49) for screening at age 25–29 years, 20 (95% CI = 11 to 39) for screening at age 30–34 years, and 13 (95% CI = 7 to 23) for screening at age 35–39 years. To outweigh these risks, screening would have to reduce breast cancer mortality by 51% (95% CI = 27% to 96%) at age 25–29 years, by 12% (95% CI = 6% to 23%) at age 30–34 years, and by 4% (95% CI = 2% to 7%) at age 35–39 years; estimates were similar for BRCA2 mutation carriers. If we assume that the mortality reduction from mammography is 15%-25% or less for young women, these results suggest that there would be no net benefit from annual mammographic screening of BRCA mutation carriers at age 25–29 years; the net benefit would be zero or small at age 30–34 years, but there should be some net benefit at age 35 or older. These results depend on a number of assumptions due to the absence of empiric data. The impact of varying these assumptions was therefore examined.

### Breast cancer screening for women at average risk: 2015 guideline update from the American cancer society [^113hk2S4]. JAMA (2015). Excellent credibility.

Breast cancer screening interval — trial, modeling, and registry data describe age- and interval-specific effects. A meta-analysis found that the benefit of an invitation to screening was not related to screening intervals among women aged 50 to 69 years, but among women randomized before age 50 years a mortality reduction was observed only with invitation at intervals less than 24 months (RR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.72–0.94) and not at intervals of 24 or more months (RR, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.72–1.50). Mathematical models suggested that annual intervals are associated with detection of fewer tumors at larger and more lethal sizes and estimated more cancer deaths averted than biennial screening, but with higher rates of false-positive examinations and biopsies; screening every other year maintained an average of 81% of the mortality benefit of annual screening with about half the number of false-positive results. In observational analyses, premenopausal women were more likely to have large tumor size (RR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.07–1.37) and poor prognosis tumors (RR, 1.11; 95% CI, 1.00–1.22) when screened at 23 to 26 months compared with 14 to 18 months.

### Screening for breast cancer: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^117ENUM6]. JAMA (2024). Excellent credibility.

Response to public comment — The USPSTF notes that no trials of breast cancer screening enrolled women 75 years or older and an emulated trial showed no benefit to screening women aged 75 to 79 or 80 to 84. The USPSTF found no evidence on the benefits or harms of individualized breast cancer screening based on risk factors. Regarding screening interval, it did not identify any randomized trials directly comparing annual vs biennial screening, and two trials conducted in the 1980s to 1990s reported no difference in breast cancer mortality or features when comparing annual vs triennial screening; modeling found that biennial screening results in greater life-years gained and mortality reduction per mammogram and has a more favorable balance of benefits to harms compared with annual screening. For dense breasts, the USPSTF clarified that the I statement is not a recommendation for or against supplemental screening in women with dense breasts and that it fundamentally means there is insufficient evidence to assess the balance of benefits and harms, or to recommend for or against supplemental screening. The USPSTF clarified that this recommendation applies to women with a family history of breast cancer but not those who have a genetic marker or syndrome or chest radiation exposure at a young age associated with a high risk of breast cancer, and stated that current evidence shows that screening for breast cancer starting at age 40 years will be of significant benefit to Black women.

### Screening for breast cancer: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^112MA68U]. JAMA (2024). Excellent credibility.

Importance — epidemiology and disparities: Among all US women, breast cancer is the second most common cancer and the second most common cause of cancer death, with an estimated 43 170 women dying of breast cancer in 2023; non-Hispanic White women have the highest incidence (5-year age-adjusted incidence rate, 136.3 cases per 100 000 women) and non-Hispanic Black women have the second highest incidence (5-year age-adjusted incidence rate, 128.3 cases per 100 000 women), incidence among women aged 40 to 49 years increased more noticeably from 2015 to 2019 with a 2.0% average annual increase, and Black women are approximately 40% more likely to die of breast cancer compared with White women.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for breast cancer, more specifically with respect to indications for screening, high-risk females, USPSTF 2019 guidelines recommend to assess females with a personal or family history of breast, ovarian, tubal, or peritoneal cancer or with an ancestry associated with BRCA1/2 gene mutations with an appropriate brief familial risk assessment tool. Provide genetic counseling and, if indicated after counseling, genetic testing in females with a positive result on the risk assessment tool.

### Effect of an educational intervention on women's health care provider knowledge gaps about breast cancer risk model use and high-risk screening recommendations [^112uBp9S]. Journal of Breast Imaging (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

To assess effectiveness of a web-based educational intervention on women's health care provider knowledge of breast cancer risk models and high-risk screening recommendations.

Methods

A web-based pre- and post-test study including 177 U.S.-based women's health care providers was conducted in 2019. Knowledge gaps were defined as fewer than 75% of respondents answering correctly. Pre- and post-test knowledge differences (McNemar test) and associations of baseline characteristics with pre-test knowledge gaps (logistic regression) were evaluated.

Results

Respondents included 131/177 (74.0%) physicians; 127/177 (71.8%) practiced obstetrics/gynecology. Pre-test, 118/177 (66.7%) knew the Gail model predicts lifetime invasive breast cancer risk; this knowledge gap persisted post-test [(121/177, 68.4%); P = 0.77]. Just 39.0% (69/177) knew the Gail model identifies women eligible for risk-reducing medications; this knowledge gap resolved. Only 48.6% (86/177) knew the Gail model should not be used to identify women meeting high-risk MRI screening guidelines; this deficiency decreased to 66.1% (117/177) post-test (P = 0.001). Pre-test, 47.5% (84/177) knew the Tyrer-Cuzick model is used to identify women meeting high-risk screening MRI criteria, 42.9% (76/177) to predict BRCA1/2 pathogenic mutation risk, and 26.0% (46/177) to predict lifetime invasive breast cancer risk. These knowledge gaps persisted but improved. For a high-risk 30-year-old, 67.8% (120/177) and 54.2% (96/177) pre-test knew screening MRI and mammography/tomosynthesis are recommended, respectively; 19.2% (34/177) knew both are recommended; and 53% (94/177) knew US is not recommended. These knowledge gaps resolved or reduced.

Conclusion

Web-based education can reduce important provider knowledge gaps about breast cancer risk models and high-risk screening recommendations.

Women aged 45 to 54 years should be screened annually (Qualified Recommendation), and women 55 years and older should transition to biennial screening or have the opportunity to continue screening annually (Qualified Recommendation). Women should have the opportunity to begin annual screening between the ages of 40 and 44 years (Qualified Recommendation), and should continue screening mammography as long as their overall health is good and they have a life expectancy of 10 years or longer (Qualified Recommendation). The ACS does not recommend clinical breast examination for breast cancer screening among average-risk women at any age (Qualified Recommendation). The target population is women at average risk — women without a personal history of breast cancer, a suspected or confirmed genetic mutation known to increase risk of breast cancer (eg, BRCA), or a history of previous radiotherapy to the chest at a young age.

Despite some controversy in recent years, the majority of experts agree on the evidence for effectiveness of breast screening by mammography for women aged 50 years and above, but for those under 50 years, the picture is much less clear. However, the issue remains of importance both to policy makers and to individual women; although the incidence of breast cancer is lower at younger ages, the life years lost due to cancers diagnosed below 50 years amount to a third of all those lost due to the disease.

### Screening and preventative strategies for patients at high risk for breast cancer [^114d4BVw]. JCO Oncology Practice (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Current US guidelines recommend more intensive breast cancer screening and preventive strategies for patients at more than 20% lifetime risk for breast and ovarian cancer (high risk for breast and ovarian cancer [HRBOC]). Guidelines recommend that yearly mammograms alternating with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) screening should be considered as early as 30 years old. Furthermore, BRCA mutation carriers should consider bilateral mastectomy and bilateral oophorectomy after age 35. It was unclear what the uptake of screening and risk-reducing strategies were for patients who were cancer-free and cancer survivors seen by Kaiser Permanente Mid-Atlantic States (KPMAS) Genetics.

Methods

We retrospectively studied female patients (members of KPMAS between 2005 and 2016) diagnosed as HRBOC and/or tested for breast cancer-related mutations by KPMAS Genetics during 2013–2016. We identified cancer diagnoses, mammogram and breast MRI screening, mastectomies, and oophorectomies that occurred before and after the Genetics visit during the study period.

Results

Our cohort included 813 women with a HRBOC diagnosis, with a median 51 years of age at diagnosis, 45% White, 38% Black, and 15% other ethnicity. Most cancers occurred prior to the Genetics visit: 513/527 breast cancer diagnoses and 55/57 ovarian cancer diagnoses. Fewer than five prophylactic mastectomies and 89 prophylactic oophorectomies were identified. Among 228 patients who were 30–75 years old, breast cancer-free at the time of HRBOC diagnosis, and members for over 6 months, 190 (83%) had at least one screening test (mammogram or MRI) after the consultation with Genetic, but 79% never had an MRI before or after the consultation.

Conclusion

Our findings suggest that earlier detection of patients with HRBOC and closer monitoring is needed.

### Screening for breast cancer: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^112MthJP]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Description

Update of the 2002 U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation statement on screening for breast cancer in the general population.

Methods

The USPSTF examined the evidence on the efficacy of 5 screening modalities in reducing mortality from breast cancer: film mammography, clinical breast examination, breast self-examination, digital mammography, and magnetic resonance imaging in order to update the 2002 recommendation. To accomplish this update, the USPSTF commissioned 2 studies: 1) a targeted systematic evidence review of 6 selected questions relating to benefits and harms of screening, and 2) a decision analysis that used population modeling techniques to compare the expected health outcomes and resource requirements of starting and ending mammography screening at different ages and using annual versus biennial screening intervals.

Recommendations

The USPSTF recommends against routine screening mammography in women aged 40 to 49 years. The decision to start regular, biennial screening mammography before the age of 50 years should be an individual one and take into account patient context, including the patient's values regarding specific benefits and harms. (Grade C recommendation) The USPSTF recommends biennial screening mammography for women between the ages of 50 and 74 years. (Grade B recommendation) The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the additional benefits and harms of screening mammography in women 75 years or older. (I statement) The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the additional benefits and harms of clinical breast examination beyond screening mammography in women 40 years or older. (I statement) The USPSTF recommends against clinicians teaching women how to perform breast self-examination. (Grade D recommendation) The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess additional benefits and harms of either digital mammography or magnetic resonance imaging instead of film mammography as screening modalities for breast cancer.

### ESR essentials: screening for breast cancer-general recommendations by EUSOBI [^113h9Q8y]. European Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer in women accounting for about 30% of all new cancer cases and the incidence is constantly increasing. Implementation of mammographic screening has contributed to a reduction in breast cancer mortality of at least 20% over the last 30 years. Screening programs usually include all women irrespective of their risk of developing breast cancer and with age being the only determining factor. This approach has some recognized limitations, including underdiagnosis, false positive cases, and overdiagnosis. Indeed, breast cancer remains a major cause of cancer-related deaths in women undergoing cancer screening. Supplemental imaging modalities, including digital breast tomosynthesis, ultrasound, breast MRI, and, more recently, contrast-enhanced mammography, are available and have already shown potential to further increase the diagnostic performances. Use of breast MRI is recommended in high-risk women and women with extremely dense breasts. Artificial intelligence has also shown promising results to support risk categorization and interval cancer reduction. The implementation of a risk-stratified approach instead of a "one-size-fits-all" approach may help to improve the benefit-to-harm ratio as well as the cost-effectiveness of breast cancer screening. KEY POINTS: Regular mammography should still be considered the mainstay of the breast cancer screening. High-risk women and women with extremely dense breast tissue should use MRI for supplemental screening or US if MRI is not available. Women need to participate actively in the decision to undergo personalized screening. KEY RECOMMENDATIONS: Mammography is an effective imaging tool to diagnose breast cancer in an early stage and to reduce breast cancer mortality (evidence level I). Until more evidence is available to move to a personalized approach, regular mammography should be considered the mainstay of the breast cancer screening. High-risk women should start screening earlier; first with yearly breast MRI which can be supplemented by yearly or biennial mammography starting at 35–40 years old (evidence level I). Breast MRI screening should be also offered to women with extremely dense breasts (evidence level I). If MRI is not available, ultrasound can be performed as an alternative, although the added value of supplemental ultrasound regarding cancer detection remains limited. Individual screening recommendations should be made through a shared decision-making process between women and physicians.

### Screening for breast cancer: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^114S3M89]. JAMA (2024). Excellent credibility.

USPSTF breast cancer screening — screening interval and starting age effects are quantified as follows: Biennial screening led to a 5% absolute decrease in 10-year cumulative false-positive biopsy rate compared with annual screening. Collaborative modeling estimates that a strategy of screening annually from ages 40 to 74 years would result in about 50% more false-positive results and 50% more overdiagnosed cases of breast cancer compared with biennial screening. Modeling also estimated that lowering the age to start screening to 40 years from 50 years would result in about a 60% increase in false-positive results and 2 additional overdiagnosed cases of breast cancer (range, 0 to 4) per 1000 women over a lifetime of screening. In contrast, screening biennially from ages 40 to 74 years would lead to 14 overdiagnosed cases of breast cancer per 1000 persons screened over the lifetime of screening, with a very wide range of estimates (4 to 37 cases) across models.

Both digital mammography and digital breast tomosynthesis (or "3D mammography") are effective mammographic screening modalities. There is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against screening for breast cancer in women 75 years or older, and there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against supplemental screening breast ultrasonography or MRI in women who have dense breasts. Clinicians should use their clinical judgment regarding whether to screen for breast cancer in women 75 years or older and whether to use supplemental screening in women who have dense breasts and an otherwise normal mammogram.

CURRENT SCREENING GUIDELINES

The uncertainty is reflected in the variation in current guidelines among countries for screening women below 50 years for breast cancer. A summary of guidelines used in 22 countries, from a survey conducted in 1995 by the International Breast Screening Network, reported that while a majority of countries or pilot projects had a lower age limit of 50 years, a number involved a lower limit of 40 years, although in countries such as Sweden and Australia policy can vary by county or state. Japan, which does not use mammography, reported a lower age limit of 30 years. In Sweden, the recommended screening interval is 1.5 years for women aged 40–49 years compared with 2 years for those aged 50 years and above. In the US, the recommendation (updated in February 2002) from the US Preventive Services Task Force is for 'screening mammography with or without clinical breast examination' (CBE) every 1 or 2 years for women aged 40 years and above. The age range was extended below 50 years despite the finding that 'the strongest evidence of benefit and reduced mortality is among women aged 50–69 years'. The US National Cancer Institute continues to recommend mammography for women in their 40s and older, while the American Cancer Society recommends 'yearly mammograms' (plus CBE) starting at 40 years. In 2001, the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care concluded that 'upon reaching the age of 40 years, Canadian women should be informed of the potential benefits and risks of screening mammography and assisted in deciding at what age they wish to initiate the manoeuvre'.

The IARC Handbook of Cancer Prevention on breast cancer screening, published in 2002, concluded that the marginal cost-effectiveness of expanding a programme to younger women (aged 40–49 years) greatly depends on its effect on reducing breast cancer mortality as estimated from randomised controlled trials, 'and that it is likely to be more cost-effective to make other changes'.

Inclusion required studies to report detection and stage distribution over more than 1 round of screening, and studies reporting only performance characteristics or detection rates were not eligible. The USPSTF also commissioned collaborative modeling from 4 CISNET teams that developed race-specific breast cancer models for Black women to provide information about effectiveness and harms of different screening strategies in Black women.

### Mammographic screening debate on study design: a need to move the field forward [^116krWEu]. BMC Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

The recently published UK report concluded that although most case-control studies and cohort studies tried to control for possible biases, and although the results were in the same direction as the randomized clinical trials, there was some concern that residual bias could have inflated the estimates from these studies. In the end the UK panel only used results of randomized clinical trials, the most stringent in the hierarchy of study designs.

The independent UK panel concluded that 'screening reduces breast cancer mortality but that some overdiagnosis occurs'. Specifically they concluded that screening confers a 20% reduction in breast cancer mortality, and that the overdiagnosis is 19% during the screening period or 11% over long term. The main challenge is that while all detected cancers will be treated, we do not yet know which of the cancers would kill the woman if left untreated. Although we have learned a substantial amount about breast cancer subtypes and prognosis over the past 12 years, the number of subtypes continues to rise. We do not yet have adequate clinical markers for these subtypes, or even prognostic markers that can accurately classify a patient as needing treatment or not. There is a strong need for additional screening methods to better differentiate cancers and specifically identify the cancers that will kill.

In assessing the overall effect of screening on mortality, the independent UK panel concluded that the best studies were old trials, studies conducted 30 or so years ago. Much has changed in both breast cancer risk factors and treatment over time. Are data from when the current screening participants were in their teens ideal to express what these women should do to avoid dying from breast cancer today? How long should we continue to use such old data as the best estimate for how mammographic screening affects breast cancer mortality? When will both sides agree that this is unwise?

The obvious alternative to rehashing old data is to force screening proponents and opponents to work together to identify the best way of using current individual based data to address the issues. A challenge is whether we have identified all the limitations of our best observational analytic designs, that is, cohort and case-control studies, and when current bias adjustments are inadequate. If the pro-screening side ignores these biases, or both sides present them too simplistically, then we will get nowhere. We ought to instead create scenarios that both sides recognize represent real problems with cohort and case-control studies, and then address each specific problem analytically, rather than going back to ecological designs.

### Personalizing breast cancer screening based on polygenic risk and family history [^112Qk8p7]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2021). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

We assessed the clinical utility of a first-degree breast cancer family history and polygenic risk score (PRS) to inform screening decisions among women aged 30–50 years.

Methods

Two established breast cancer models evaluated digital mammography screening strategies in the 1985 US birth cohort by risk groups defined by family history and PRS based on 313 single nucleotide polymorphisms. Strategies varied in initiation age (30, 35, 40, 45, and 50 years) and interval (annual, hybrid, biennial, triennial). The benefits (breast cancer deaths averted, life-years gained) and harms (false-positive mammograms, overdiagnoses) were compared with those seen with 3 established screening guidelines.

Results

Women with a breast cancer family history who initiated biennial screening at age 40 years (vs 50 years) had a 36% (model range = 29%-40%) increase in life-years gained and 20% (model range = 16%-24%) more breast cancer deaths averted, but 21% (model range = 17%-23%) more overdiagnoses and 63% (model range = 62%-64%) more false positives. Screening tailored to PRS vs biennial screening from 50 to 74 years had smaller positive effects on life-years gained (20%) and breast cancer deaths averted (11%) but also smaller increases in overdiagnoses (10%) and false positives (26%). Combined use of family history and PRS vs biennial screening from 50 to 74 years had the greatest increase in life-years gained (29%) and breast cancer deaths averted (18%).

Conclusions

Our results suggest that breast cancer family history and PRS could guide screening decisions before age 50 years among women at increased risk for breast cancer but expected increases in overdiagnoses and false positives should be expected.

### Practical problems with clinical guidelines for breast cancer prevention based on remaining lifetime risk [^114L2wxe]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2015). Low credibility.

Breast cancer risk models, which estimate a woman′s absolute risk of developing breast cancer either for a fixed horizon (eg, five or 10 years) or for a woman's remaining lifetime, are used in clinical guidelines for decisions about MRI screening and risk-reducing surgeries. For example, the US National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines recommend consideration of risk-reducing strategies for women over the age of 35 years whose five-year invasive breast cancer risk as determined by the Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool (BCRAT) is 1.67% or higher. Furthermore, consideration of annual mammograms and MRI starting at age 30 years is recommended for women with remaining lifetime risks (RLRs) of 20% or higher (as determined by risk models that are largely dependent on family history). However, the clinical guidelines do not suggest which risk model to use, and model predictions can differ depending on the risk factors they include and whether or not they consider the competing risk of death. In addition, using RLRs as basis for screening recommendations is problematic; for example, a young woman can have small short-term risk but large RLR — based on her age alone.

Breast cancer risk models (reviewed by Meads et al.) differ in the risk factors they include and in the way they handle the competing risk of death. In general, the models are designed for two groups: 1) women without a predisposing mutation or strong family history and 2) women at higher risk because of personal or family history of breast or ovarian cancer. Models of the first type (e.g. BRCAT) use only limited information on family history (e.g. number of first-degree relatives with breast cancer), while those of the second type use more detailed information (e.g. ages at onset of relatives' cancers, and/or carriage of specific breast cancer susceptibility alleles). Underlying assumptions about the nature of genetic risks differ among the models of the second type (e.g. the Claus model assumes one risk locus, the International Breast Cancer Intervention Study (IBIS) model and the BRCAPRO model assume two risk loci, and the Breast and Ovarian Analysis of Disease Incidence and Carrier Estimation Algorithm assumes an additional familial/polygenic component).

### Should women under 50 be screened for breast cancer? [^117Mv2H6]. British Journal of Cancer (2004). Low credibility.

Screening in high-risk women

Of particular concern in many settings is the management of women at increased risk of breast cancer due to family history of the disease. It is estimated that such cases may account for between 5 and 10% of all cases, and such women will be at increased risk from a young age. It has been estimated that most of the excess risk of familial breast cancer occurs before 50 years and it is generally recommended that screening start 5–10 years before the earliest age at diagnosis of affected family members.

Clearly if screening is effective in this age group, then the absolute benefit in this subgroup will be greater, as will the cost-effectiveness. Nevertheless, there is no more evidence for effectiveness in high-risk women than in the general population.

In the UK, two studies are in progress to assess the effect of screening in high-risk women. A randomised controlled trial is comparing the sensitivity of mammography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in high-risk women identified from genetics clinics. Magnetic resonance imaging does not involve the use of ionising radiation, and hence may be of particular relevance for screening at young ages. However, studies to date have suggested high sensitivity but possibly low specificity. The cost of the technique at present is such that its use is only under consideration for women at high risk. A second study is evaluating mammographic surveillance in women under 50 years with a family history of breast cancer, with the aim of estimating the difference in breast cancer mortality in screened compared with unscreened women, and estimating the cost-effectiveness of regular mammography in this group.

Ultrasound has also been considered as a screening modality for high-risk women, although there are doubts about both sensitivity and specificity. One recent study concluded that MRI is likely to be superior as a screening method for such women.

The increased radiation risk in these women will be affected by the choice of model (additive or relative risk). It is possible that some women genetically predisposed to breast cancer may also have increased sensitivity to radiation, and if screened frequently from a young age will also have increased total exposure. An example is ataxia telangiectasia (AT), an inherited autosomal recessive disease. Women who are AT gene carriers are also at increased risk of developing breast cancer; however, there remains debate as to whether this risk is increased by exposure to ionising radiation.

### Impact of age-specific recommendation changes on organized breast screening programs [^116qD3E5]. Preventive Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Recent changes in recommendations for mammography screening for women in their forties could have an impact on organized screening programs, as these require clear definition of target and eligible populations.

Current Status

Internationally, a majority of programs target women fifty and over, and so the recent USPSTF age recommendations for screening are quite consistent with this practice. However, there is a good deal of variability in the availability of population-based screening programs to women in their forties should they choose to participate.

Future Impact

Several programs are reviewing recommendations regarding the eligibility of women in their forties; as guidelines indicate women in this age group should be eligible for screening, even if not targeted, there is discussion as to whether they should be allowed in programs so that they benefit from the same programmatic quality assurance afforded to the target population of women over 50. Clear communication of the evidentiary basis for the eligibility criteria and target populations is required, so that the public is aware that programs are designed to deliver maximal population impact, while minimizing population risk.

### Screening mammography for average-risk women: the controversy and NCCN's position [^111FpaD3]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2018). Low credibility.

Breast cancer remains the most common nonskin cancer among women and a leading cause of morbidity and mortality. Early detection through screening and advances in treatment have contributed to a 39% mortality reduction in the United States since 1990. The NCCN Guidelines for Breast Cancer Screening and Diagnosis recommend annual mammographic screening for average-risk women beginning at age 40 years. Mammographic screening and subsequent treatment reduces breast cancer mortality based on a wide range of studies. This article highlights NCCN's position on screening mammography and the screening controversy.

### Breast cancer screening for women at average risk: 2015 guideline update from the American cancer society [^116ZTVC4]. JAMA (2015). Excellent credibility.

American Cancer Society (ACS) average-risk screening — older age, health, and life expectancy: Health and life expectancy, not simply age, must be considered in screening decisions, and a significant proportion of women 75 years and older are in good health and can be expected to live considerably longer than 10 or more years. Based on 2010 US Life Tables, approximately 50% of 80-year-old women and 25% of 85-year-old women will live at least 10 years, and an older woman's life expectancy exceeding 10 years is generally defined as having greater than a 50% probability of surviving 10 years. For women who are healthy and have at least a 10-year life expectancy, individualized decisions about screening mammography should be considered, and the GDG recommends that women should continue screening as long as their overall health is good and they have a life expectancy of 10 years or longer.

Recommendation 2 — screening continuation in older women states that women should continue screening mammography as long as their overall health is good and they have a life expectancy of 10 years or longer (Qualified Recommendation). Breast cancer incidence continues to increase until ages 75 to 79 years, and 26% of breast cancer deaths each year are attributable to a diagnosis after age 74 years; none of the RCTs included women 75 years and older, although observational studies have observed a reduction in breast cancer mortality associated with mammographic detection among women aged 75 years and older. The guideline notes that the reduced life expectancy associated with being older decreases the likelihood of screening benefit in some women.

### Practice bulletin number 179: breast cancer risk assessment and screening in average-risk women [^117XwTA4]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Low credibility.

Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in women in the United States and the second leading cause of cancer death in American women (1). Regular screening mammography starting at age 40 years reduces breast cancer mortality in average-risk women (2). Screening, however, also exposes women to harm through false-positive test results and overdiagnosis of biologically indolent lesions. Differences in balancing benefits and harms have led to differences among major guidelines about what age to start, what age to stop, and how frequently to recommend mammography screening in average-risk women (2–4). Breast cancer risk assessment is very important for identifying women who may benefit from more intensive breast cancer surveillance; however, there is no standardized approach to office-based breast cancer risk assessment in the United States. This can lead to missed opportunities to identify women at high risk of breast cancer and may result in applying average-risk screening recommendations to high-risk women. Risk assessment and identification of women at high risk allow for referral to health care providers with expertise in cancer genetics counseling and testing for breast cancer-related germline mutations (eg, BRCA), patient counseling about risk-reduction options, and cascade testing to identify family members who also may be at increased risk. The purpose of this Practice Bulletin is to discuss breast cancer risk assessment, review breast cancer screening guidelines in average-risk women, and outline some of the controversies surrounding breast cancer screening. It will present recommendations for using a framework of shared decision making to assist women in balancing their personal values regarding benefits and harms of screening at various ages and intervals to make personal screening choices from within a range of reasonable options. Recommendations for women at elevated risk and discussion of new technologies, such as tomosynthesis, are beyond the scope of this document and are addressed in other publications of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) (5–7).

### Breast cancer screening for women at average risk: 2015 guideline update from the American cancer society [^112oTWjo]. JAMA (2015). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Breast cancer is a leading cause of premature mortality among US women. Early detection has been shown to be associated with reduced breast cancer morbidity and mortality.

Objective

To update the American Cancer Society (ACS) 2003 breast cancer screening guideline for women at average risk for breast cancer.

Process

The ACS commissioned a systematic evidence review of the breast cancer screening literature to inform the update and a supplemental analysis of mammography registry data to address questions related to the screening interval. Formulation of recommendations was based on the quality of the evidence and judgment (incorporating values and preferences) about the balance of benefits and harms.

Evidence Synthesis

Screening mammography in women aged 40 to 69 years is associated with a reduction in breast cancer deaths across a range of study designs, and inferential evidence supports breast cancer screening for women 70 years and older who are in good health. Estimates of the cumulative lifetime risk of false-positive examination results are greater if screening begins at younger ages because of the greater number of mammograms, as well as the higher recall rate in younger women. The quality of the evidence for overdiagnosis is not sufficient to estimate a lifetime risk with confidence. Analysis examining the screening interval demonstrates more favorable tumor characteristics when premenopausal women are screened annually vs biennially. Evidence does not support routine clinical breast examination as a screening method for women at average risk.

Recommendations

The ACS recommends that women with an average risk of breast cancer should undergo regular screening mammography starting at age 45 years (strong recommendation). Women aged 45 to 54 years should be screened annually (qualified recommendation). Women 55 years and older should transition to biennial screening or have the opportunity to continue screening annually (qualified recommendation). Women should have the opportunity to begin annual screening between the ages of 40 and 44 years (qualified recommendation). Women should continue screening mammography as long as their overall health is good and they have a life expectancy of 10 years or longer (qualified recommendation). The ACS does not recommend clinical breast examination for breast cancer screening among average-risk women at any age (qualified recommendation).

Conclusions and Relevance

These updated ACS guidelines provide evidence-based recommendations for breast cancer screening for women at average risk of breast cancer. These recommendations should be considered by physicians and women in discussions about breast cancer screening.

### Screening for breast cancer in average-risk women: a guidance statement from the American College of Physicians [^112MVT8d]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Description

The purpose of this guidance statement is to provide advice to clinicians on breast cancer screening in average-risk women based on a review of existing guidelines and the evidence they include.

Methods

This guidance statement is derived from an appraisal of selected guidelines from around the world that address breast cancer screening, as well as their included evidence. All national guidelines published in English between 1 January 2013 and 15 November 2017 in the National Guideline Clearinghouse or Guidelines International Network library were included. In addition, the authors selected other guidelines commonly used in clinical practice. Web sites associated with all selected guidelines were checked for updates on 10 December 2018. The AGREE II (Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation II) instrument was used to evaluate the quality of guidelines.

Target Audience and Patient Population

The target audience is all clinicians, and the target patient population is all asymptomatic women with average risk for breast cancer.

Guidance Statement 1

In average-risk women aged 40 to 49 years, clinicians should discuss whether to screen for breast cancer with mammography before age 50 years. Discussion should include the potential benefits and harms and a woman's preferences. The potential harms outweigh the benefits in most women aged 40 to 49 years.

Guidance Statement 2

In average-risk women aged 50 to 74 years, clinicians should offer screening for breast cancer with biennial mammography.

Guidance Statement 3

In average-risk women aged 75 years or older or in women with a life expectancy of 10 years or less, clinicians should discontinue screening for breast cancer.

Guidance Statement 4

In average-risk women of all ages, clinicians should not use clinical breast examination to screen for breast cancer.

Age to start or stop screening — The USPSTF did not identify any randomized clinical trials designed to test the comparative effectiveness of different ages to start or stop screening that reported morbidity, mortality, or quality-of-life outcomes. An emulation study reported that continued screening between the ages of 70 and 79 years was associated with a 22% decrease in the risk of breast cancer mortality compared with cessation at age 70 years, although the trial emulation study found no difference in the hazard ratio or absolute rates of breast cancer mortality with continued screening vs discontinued screening from ages 70 to 79 years across 80 to 84 years.

Recommendations of other organizations for breast cancer screening — The American Cancer Society "recommends that women with an average risk of breast cancer should undergo regular screening mammography starting at age 45 years" and "suggests that women aged 45 to 54 years should be screened annually", that those "55 years or older should transition to biennial screening or have the opportunity to continue screening annually", may "begin annual screening between the ages of 40 and 44 years", and should continue "as long as their overall health is good and they have a life expectancy of 10 years or longer". The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists "recommends that women at average risk of breast cancer should be offered screening mammography starting at age 40 years", and if not initiated in their 40s, "by no later than age 50 years", with screening "every 1 or 2 years" and continued "until at least age 75 years", with decisions "Beyond age 75 years" based on shared decision-making. The American College of Radiology and the Society of Breast Imaging "recommend annual screening mammography beginning at age 40 years for women at average risk", advise continuing "past age 74 years, without an upper age limit, unless severe comorbidities limit life expectancy", and the American College of Radiology "also recommends breast cancer risk assessment by age 25 years for all individuals". The American Academy of Family Physicians "supports the 2016 USPSTF recommendation on screening for breast cancer".

### The WISDOM study: breaking the deadlock in the breast cancer screening debate [^114v1HsV]. NPJ Breast Cancer (2017). Low credibility.

The US Preventative Task Force systematic review concluded in 2015, much like it had in 2009, that mammographic screening benefits women over 50 and that biennial, not annual, screening was recommended for women ages 50–74. After weighing the balance of harms and benefits for women aged 40–49, screening was not recommended routinely for women in their forties. Instead, the USPSTF suggested an individualized approach taking patient risk and personal preference into account. In contrast, 2017 guidelines from the American College of Radiology and the Society of Breast Imaging currently recommend annual screening starting at age 40. The American Cancer Society has revised their guidelines and recommend annual mammograms for women over 45 of average risk, with women between the ages of 40–44 provided the opportunity to begin annual screening. Women over the age of 55 are recommended to receive biennial screening, although annual screening may be considered.

Although the academic debate has progressed little in these 30 years, what has changed is public awareness of this issue. The vast press coverage of the Canadian National Breast Cancer Screening Study (CNBCSS) in 2014 brought the potential harms of screening into the public spotlight. Not only did the 25-year analysis of the CNBCSS show, as it had at both 10 and 15 years, that annual screening failed to reduce breast cancer mortality, it provided the first-ever estimates of overdiagnosis in a population-based annual screening program: half of all screen-detected non-palpable cancers were estimated to be indolent lesions that would otherwise never have come to clinical attention.

For some, this result simply confirmed previous findings showing that up to 20% of all cancers (50% of screen-detected cancers) fall into the category of overdiagnosis – — meaning a woman has a greater chance of being over-diagnosed than of having her life saved by screening. Others pointed to studies demonstrating there is little, if any overdiagnosis in breast cancer, labeling CNBCSS as a flawed analysis or simply the latest way to attack screening. The debate reached such an unhealthy tenor that published exchanges even included accusations of a scientific conspiracy to reduce access to mammography.

### Cost-effectiveness of population-wide genomic screening for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer in the United States [^112AnEy6]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Sensitivity Analyses

In the 1-way sensitivity analysis for 30-year-old women, the ICER was most sensitive to 5-year breast cancer survival, screening assay cost, cancer risk reductions after RRSO, and RRM and RRSO uptake (eFigure 3 in the Supplement). For 45-year-old women, the ICER was most sensitive to 5-year breast cancer survival, RRM and RRSO uptake, the mortality reduction applied to early-stage breast cancer, screening assay cost, and HBOC carrier prevalence.

Probabilistic sensitivity analysis results are presented as cost-effectiveness acceptability curves, which show the bayesian probability that the results are cost-effective at increasing willingness to pay per QALY thresholds (eFigure 4 in the Supplement). For 30-year-old women, population screening had a 0%, 78%, and 100% probability of being cost-effective vs family history–based testing at the $50 000, $100 000, and $150 000 per QALY thresholds, respectively. When we added potential harm to noncarriers who avoid recommended mammography, the probability of population screening being cost-effective decreased to 0%, 2%, and 34% at the $50 000, $100 000, and $150 000 per QALY thresholds, respectively. Population screening was not cost-effective for 45-year-old women in any probabilistic simulations with a willingness to pay per QALY below $150 000.

### Personalized early detection and prevention of breast cancer: ENVISION consensus statement [^113eDmz9]. Nature Reviews: Clinical Oncology (2020). High credibility.

Women with pathogenic germline mutations in cancer susceptibility genes — that is, in BRCA1 or BRCA2 (BRCA1/2) — may opt to undergo prophylactic bilateral mastectomy; primary chemoprophylaxis with tamoxifen or other selective oestrogen receptor modulators has also been recommended in this group, albeit the uptake is low. Historically, members of this high-risk group have been identified on an opportunistic basis following self-referral of women with a family history of breast or ovarian cancer, or on the basis of an ancestry associated with an increased prevalence of clinically significant pathogenic variants of BRCA1/2 (for example, in those of Jewish descent). Currently, genetic testing remains somewhat restricted for women with breast cancer; those with triple-negative, bilateral or young-onset disease might be offered a test at diagnosis, but most will be offered testing only if they also have a noted family history of the disease. The 2019 US Preventive Services Task Force recommendations expand the population in which eligibility for genetic testing should be assessed to include women with a personal or family history of breast, ovarian, tubal or peritoneal cancer, in addition to women who have an ancestry associated with pathogenic BRCA1/2 variants.

At present, the mammographic screening programmes used for early detection of breast cancer in most high-income countries are based on the results of trials conducted at least 20–30 years ago – and have age as the only entry criterion, although the starting and stopping ages (varying from 40 to 74 years) and the frequency of screens (yearly to triennially) differ between countries. This 'one-size-fits-all' approach does not take into account the heterogeneity of the breast cancer subtypes and of the risk in the population. Three decades of mammographic early detection have witnessed an increase in the incidence of early stage cancers with a low-risk tumour biology and an increase in the detection of in situ disease, without a concomitant proportionate decrease in incidence of advanced-stage disease. Increasingly, calls have been made for a new approach to early detection with a focus on the identification of more consequential cancers and on avoiding the detection of indolent or ultra-low-risk disease.

### A promoting early presentation intervention increases breast cancer awareness in older women after 2 years: a randomised controlled trial [^112cNPQi]. British Journal of Cancer (2011). Low credibility.

Material and Methods

The PEP Intervention is a scripted 10-min one-to-one interaction between a radiographer and the woman, supported by a booklet, delivered after the woman has had her mammographic examination. The script covers the symptoms of breast cancer, the increased risk of developing breast cancer with increasing age, rehearsal of the skills required to check for breast changes and what women should do if they discover a breast change.

We randomised women attending their final routine appointment on the National Health Service Breast Screening Programme to the PEP Intervention, or booklet alone, or usual care, in three breast screening services in London and South East England during 2007–2008. Usual care consisted of standard practice in the National Health Service Breast Screening Programme after final invited mammogram, in other words, brief verbal and/or written information to each woman that she would not longer be invited for screening every 3 years, but that she might continue to be screened at this interval on request.

The primary outcome was breast cancer awareness measured using a self-complete postal questionnaire asking about knowledge that the risk of breast cancer increases with age ('In the next year who is most likely to get breast cancer?' A 30-year-old woman; a 50-year-old woman; a 70-year-old woman; a woman of any age), recognition of non-lump symptoms of breast cancer from a list and reported frequency of breast checking ('How often do you check your breasts?' Rarely or never; at least every 6 months; at least once a month; at least once a week.).

We measured breast cancer awareness at baseline, 1 month, 6 months, 1 year and 2 years post randomisation. We analysed the data using robust generalized estimating equations with a logit link and binomial distribution for the outcome using Stata version 11 (StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA). This method takes account of the correlation between repeated observations of the same individual. We performed an unadjusted analysis and repeated it adjusting for baseline characteristics: marital status, education, ethnicity and Index of Multiple Deprivation.

Our previous report provides further detail of the methods.

### Breast cancer screening with mammography [^115cRB7Z]. Current Oncology Reports (2011). Low credibility.

There has been a great deal of controversy regarding the change in breast cancer screening recommendations released by the US Preventive Services Task Force in November 2009. Despite limited new data, the Task Force changed their previous recommendations delaying initial screening of asymptomatic women from age 40 to age 50 and recommending biennial rather than annual breast cancer screening. It is important to fully understand the nuances of the analysis and modeling upon which the revisions were based in order to accurately inform patients of the risks and benefits of breast cancer screening. Several new studies as well as additional guidelines have also been released over the past year which further inform the debate, and a number of commentaries have helped to place the risks and benefit in clinical and societal context.

### United States preventive services task force screening mammography recommendations: science ignored [^111QYd9c]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this article is to examine the scientific evidence considered by the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) in recommending against screening mammography in women 40–49 years old and against annual screening mammography in women 50 and older. We use evidence made available to the USPSTF to estimate the benefits and "harms" of screening mammography in women 40 years old and older. We use Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network modeling to compare lives saved by different screening scenarios and the summary of evidence prepared for the USPSTF to estimate the frequency of harms of screening mammography by age.

Conclusion

Averaged over the six Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network models of benefit, screening mammography shows greatest benefit — a 39.6% mortality reduction — from annual screening of women 40–84 years old. This screening regimen saves 71% more lives than the USPSTF-recommended regimen of biennial screening of women 50–74 years old, which had a 23.2% mortality reduction. For U.S. women currently 30–39 years old, annual screening mammography from ages 40–84 years would save 99,829 more lives than USPSTF recommendations if all women comply, and 64,889 more lives with the current 65% compliance rate. The potential harms of a screening examination in women 40–49 years old, on average, consist of the risk of a recall for diagnostic workup every 12 years, a negative biopsy every 149 years, a missed breast cancer every 1,000 years, and a fatal radiation-induced breast cancer every 76,000–97,000 years. Evidence made available to the USPSTF strongly supports the mortality benefit of annual screening mammography beginning at age 40 years, whereas potential harms of screening with this regimen are minor.

### The role of MRI in breast cancer screening [^112HQNt6]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2009). Low credibility.

The 2009 NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology for Breast Cancer Screening and Diagnosis include significant updates for the role of MRI in screening women at increased risk for breast cancer. The NCCN now recommends considering breast MRI as an adjunct to annual mammography and clinical breast examination for women who have a BRCA1 or -2 mutation or who have a first-degree relative who has a BRCA1 or -2 mutation but who have not undergone genetic testing themselves; those who are determined to have a lifetime risk greater than 20% based on models that are highly dependent on family history; and those with a history of lobular carcinoma in situ. MRI is also recommended for patients who underwent radiation treatment to the chest between 10 and 30 years of age, and in those who carry or have a first-degree relative who carries a genetic mutation in the TP53 or PTEN genes (Li-Fraumeni, Cowden, and Bannahyan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndromes). MRI is specifically not recommended for screening women at average risk for breast cancer. This article describes the peer-reviewed, published clinical research trials evaluating breast MRI in high-risk patients, on which the NCCN guidelines were based, and provides suggestions for future research.

### ESR essentials: screening for breast cancer-general recommendations by EUSOBI [^115CM1HU]. European Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer in women accounting for about 30% of all new cancer cases and the incidence is constantly increasing. Implementation of mammographic screening has contributed to a reduction in breast cancer mortality of at least 20% over the last 30 years. Screening programs usually include all women irrespective of their risk of developing breast cancer and with age being the only determining factor. This approach has some recognized limitations, including underdiagnosis, false positive cases, and overdiagnosis. Indeed, breast cancer remains a major cause of cancer-related deaths in women undergoing cancer screening. Supplemental imaging modalities, including digital breast tomosynthesis, ultrasound, breast MRI, and, more recently, contrast-enhanced mammography, are available and have already shown potential to further increase the diagnostic performances. Use of breast MRI is recommended in high-risk women and women with extremely dense breasts. Artificial intelligence has also shown promising results to support risk categorization and interval cancer reduction. The implementation of a risk-stratified approach instead of a "one-size-fits-all" approach may help to improve the benefit-to-harm ratio as well as the cost-effectiveness of breast cancer screening.

Key Points

Regular mammography should still be considered the mainstay of the breast cancer screening.
High-risk women and women with extremely dense breast tissue should use MRI for supplemental screening or US if MRI is not available.
Women need to participate actively in the decision to undergo personalized screening.

Key recommendations

Mammography is an effective imaging tool to diagnose breast cancer in an early stage and to reduce breast cancer mortality (evidence level I). Until more evidence is available to move to a personalized approach, regular mammography should be considered the mainstay of the breast cancer screening.
High-risk women should start screening earlier; first with yearly breast MRI which can be supplemented by yearly or biennial mammography starting at 35–40 years old (evidence level I). Breast MRI screening should be also offered to women with extremely dense breasts (evidence level I). If MRI is not available, ultrasound can be performed as an alternative, although the added value of supplemental ultrasound regarding cancer detection remains limited.
Individual screening recommendations should be made through a shared decision-making process between women and physicians.

### Breast cancer screening for women at average risk: 2015 guideline update from the American cancer society [^114wf3dd]. JAMA (2015). Excellent credibility.

American Cancer Society (ACS) 2015 breast cancer screening for women at average risk — key age bands and modalities are: Women should have the opportunity to begin annual screening between the ages of 40 and 44 years (Qualified Recommendation). Women should undergo regular screening mammography beginning at age 45 years (Strong Recommendation), and women aged 45 to 54 years should be screened annually (Qualified Recommendation). Women 55 years and older should transition to biennial screening or have the opportunity to continue screening annually (Qualified Recommendation). Women should continue screening mammography as long as their overall health is good and they have a life expectancy of 10 years or longer (Qualified Recommendation). Clinical breast examination is not recommended for breast cancer screening among average-risk women at any age (Qualified Recommendation). All women should become familiar with the potential benefits, limitations, and harms associated with breast cancer screening. Average-risk women were defined as those without a personal history of breast cancer, a suspected or confirmed genetic mutation known to increase risk of breast cancer (eg, BRCA), or a history of previous radiotherapy to the chest at a young age. In contrast, ACS, 2003 guidance stated: Begin annual mammography screening at age 40 years; For women in their 20s and 30s, it is recommended that clinical breast examination be part of a periodic health examination, preferably at least every 3 years; Asymptomatic women aged 40 years and older should continue to receive a clinical breast examination as part of a periodic health examination, preferably annually.

### ACR appropriateness criteriaBreast cancer screening [^117LahsN]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

Breast cancer screening recommendations are based on risk factors. For average-risk women, screening mammography and/or digital breast tomosynthesis is recommended beginning at age 40. Ultrasound (US) may be useful as an adjunct to mammography for incremental cancer detection in women with dense breasts, but the balance between increased cancer detection and the increased risk of a false-positive examination should be considered in the decision. For intermediate-risk women, US or MRI may be indicated as an adjunct to mammography depending upon specific risk factors. For women at high risk due to prior mantle radiation between the ages of 10 to 30, mammography is recommended starting 8 years after radiation therapy but not before age 25. For women with a genetic predisposition, annual screening mammography is recommended beginning 10 years earlier than the affected relative at the time of diagnosis but not before age 30. Annual screening MRI is recommended in high-risk women as an adjunct to mammography. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® female breast cancer screening: 2025 update [^112AewdP]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Routine screening substantially reduces the risk of mortality and morbidity of breast cancer with early detection. Multiple different imaging modalities may be used to screen for breast cancer. Screening recommendations differ based on an individual's risk of developing breast cancer. Numerous factors contribute to breast cancer risk, which is frequently divided into three major categories: average, intermediate, and high risk. For patients assigned female at birth with native breast tissue, mammography and digital breast tomosynthesis are recommended for breast cancer screening in all risk categories. In high-risk patients, screening with breast MRI is recommended starting as early as 25 to 30 years of age and mammography and digital breast tomosynthesis with a variable starting age between 25 and 40 years of age, depending on the type of risk. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process support the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer reviewed journals. Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where peer reviewed literature is lacking or equivocal, experts may be the primary evidentiary source available to formulate a recommendation.

### A randomised controlled trial of an intervention to promote early presentation of breast cancer in older women: effect on breast cancer awareness [^115DMa5c]. British Journal of Cancer (2009). Low credibility.

Discussion

The intervention increased breast cancer awareness among older women compared with usual care at 1 month, with the interaction supplemented by a booklet having a greater effect than the booklet alone. Thirty-three per cent of those receiving the interaction plus booklet and 13% of those receiving the booklet alone were breast cancer aware compared with 4% of women receiving usual care. These improvements in breast cancer awareness were sustained at 12 months although were somewhat less marked (24% of the interaction plus booklet group and 12% of the booklet only group compared with 4% of the usual care group). Of the three components of breast cancer awareness, the interaction plus booklet and the booklet alone had the most marked effect on knowledge of age-related risk. The interaction plus booklet was also associated with a statistically significant increase in knowledge of breast cancer symptoms.

Only 3% of the women were breast cancer aware (as defined prospectively for this study) at baseline. This may explain why so many women delay presenting with breast cancer symptoms and have poor survival as a result. Knowledge of age-related risk was particularly poor (only 11% were aware that a 70-year-old woman was at higher risk than a 30-year-old woman or a 50-year-old woman), perhaps because of heavy media coverage of younger women with breast cancer and the current upper age limits on the NHS Breast Screening Programme.

The efficacy of the booklet alone was limited. It was important to test the booklet alone, as it would be cheaper to deliver on the NHS than the one-to-one interaction. The interaction plus booklet was probably more effective because it incorporated features thought to promote behaviour change: a direct recommendation from a health professional, tailoring and positive motivational style and verbal persuasion.

### The recent US preventive services task force guidelines are not supported by the scientific evidence and should be rescinded [^113USqxK]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2010). Low credibility.

The recent US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) guidelines on mammographic screening ignore the scientific evidence and should be rescinded. There are no data to support the age of 50 years as a threshold for screening. There are no data to support screening women aged 40 to 49 years on the basis of risk. The USPSTF failed to understand the randomized controlled trials and used the lowest possible benefit in its calculations. The death rate from breast cancer has decreased by 30%, primarily because of screening. The agency ignored direct data with regard to decreasing deaths in real populations in favor of computer models. The USPSTF admits that its guidelines will result in unnecessary deaths from breast cancer that could be avoided by screening annually beginning at the age of 40 years.

### Breast cancer screening for women at average risk: 2015 guideline update from the American cancer society [^112ukACC]. JAMA (2015). Excellent credibility.

American Cancer Society breast cancer screening — key questions for average-risk women focus on evaluating mammography versus no screening for women 40 years and older with variation by age, screening interval, and prior screening history; comparing annual, biennial, triennial, or other screening intervals among those screened with mammography; and assessing clinical breast examination (CBE) versus no CBE for women 20 years and older with variation by age, interval, and participation in mammography screening.

### Breast cancer screening for women at average risk: 2015 guideline update from the American cancer society [^1112qd1c]. JAMA (2015). Excellent credibility.

American Cancer Society (ACS) evidence synthesis for average-risk women reports that screening mammography in women aged 40 to 69 years is associated with a reduction in breast cancer deaths across a range of study designs. Estimates of the cumulative lifetime risk of false-positive examination results are greater if screening begins at younger ages because of the greater number of mammograms, as well as the higher recall rate in younger women. The quality of the evidence for overdiagnosis is not sufficient to estimate a lifetime risk with confidence. Analysis examining the screening interval demonstrates more favorable tumor characteristics when premenopausal women are screened annually vs biennially. Evidence does not support routine clinical breast examination as a screening method for women at average risk.

### Current guidelines and gaps in breast cancer screening [^115XETkW]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Breast cancer is the most common nonskin cancer in women and the second leading cause of cancer death for women in the United States. Mammography screening is proven to significantly decrease breast cancer mortality, with a 40% or more reduction expected with annual use starting at age 40 for women of average risk. However, less than half of all eligible women have a mammogram annually. The elimination of cost sharing for screening made possible by the Affordable Care Act (2010) encouraged screening but mainly for those already insured. The United States Preventive Services Task Force 2009 guidelines recommended against screening those 40 to 49 years old and have left women over 74 years of age vulnerable to coverage loss. Other populations for whom significant gaps in risk information or screening use exist, including women of lower socioeconomic status, black women, men at higher than average risk of breast cancer, and sexual and gender minorities. Further work is needed to achieve higher rates of screening acceptance for all appropriate individuals so that the full mortality and treatment benefits of mammography screening can be realized.

### Screening for breast cancer: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^111v445a]. JAMA (2024). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Among all US women, breast cancer is the second most common cancer and the second most common cause of cancer death. In 2023, an estimated 43 170 women died of breast cancer. Non-Hispanic White women have the highest incidence of breast cancer and non-Hispanic Black women have the highest mortality rate.

Objective

The USPSTF commissioned a systematic review to evaluate the comparative effectiveness of different mammography-based breast cancer screening strategies by age to start and stop screening, screening interval, modality, use of supplemental imaging, or personalization of screening for breast cancer on the incidence of and progression to advanced breast cancer, breast cancer morbidity, and breast cancer-specific or all-cause mortality, and collaborative modeling studies to complement the evidence from the review.

Population

Cisgender women and all other persons assigned female at birth aged 40 years or older at average risk of breast cancer.

Evidence Assessment

The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that biennial screening mammography in women aged 40 to 74 years has a moderate net benefit. The USPSTF concludes that the evidence is insufficient to determine the balance of benefits and harms of screening mammography in women 75 years or older and the balance of benefits and harms of supplemental screening for breast cancer with breast ultrasound or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), regardless of breast density.

Recommendation

The USPSTF recommends biennial screening mammography for women aged 40 to 74 years. (B recommendation) The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening mammography in women 75 years or older. (I statement) The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of supplemental screening for breast cancer using breast ultrasonography or MRI in women identified to have dense breasts on an otherwise negative screening mammogram.

### A randomised controlled trial of an intervention to promote early presentation of breast cancer in older women: effect on breast cancer awareness [^115ExwET]. British Journal of Cancer (2009). Low credibility.

Knowledge of non-lump symptoms and reported breast checking increased quite markedly in the women who received usual care alone over the 12-month follow-up. This may be due to what has been called the 'mere measurement' effect: either the questionnaire itself increased awareness, or women started to guess the correct, or most appropriate, answers because they were repeatedly asked the same question.

A systematic review of interventions to promote cancer awareness found very limited evidence of effectiveness of any interventions. It found only five RCTs of interventions to promote cancer awareness aimed at individuals, of moderate to good quality. All found more modest effects on cancer awareness than we achieved. The trial finding the greatest effect was of an intensive intervention (tailored written information with a reinforcing newsletter at 12 months plus two telephone counselling sessions) primarily aiming to increase breast screening uptake. It increased the proportion who gave the correct answer to a question about age-related risk by 12% compared with usual care after 2 years. In our study, the interaction plus booklet, which increased the proportion correctly identifying a 70-year-old woman as at higher risk than a 50-year-old woman or 30-year-old woman by 27% at 12 months, compares well with this. Less intensive interventions such as mailed information and interactive computer programmes increased cancer awareness more modestly. The effects of the interaction plus booklet on reported breast checking at least monthly (77% vs 72% after 12 months) are similar to those found in trials to promote breast self-examination: a RCT in the United States found that a 45-min class increased the proportion who reported monthly breast self-examination from 51% to 62% after 6 months.

### ACR appropriateness criteriaBreast cancer screening [^112XjL5Y]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2017). Medium credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for breast cancer, more specifically with respect to indications for screening, high-risk females, ACR 2017 guidelines recommend to obtain mammography or digital breast tomosynthesis (with accompanying planar or synthesized 2D images) in high-risk females (carrier of BRCA mutation or an untested first-degree relative of a carrier, history of chest irradiation between 10–30 years of age, or ≥ 20% lifetime risk of breast cancer). Obtain MRI as an adjunct to mammography or digital breast tomosynthesis. Obtain breast ultrasound if the patient cannot tolerate MRI.

### Practice bulletin number 179: breast cancer risk assessment and screening in average-risk women [^1133i2kg]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Medium credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for breast cancer, more specifically with respect to indications for screening, average-risk females, ACOG 2017 guidelines recommend to consider offering screening clinical breast examination in asymptomatic, average-risk females in the context of an informed, shared decision-making approach recognizing the uncertainty of additional benefits and the possibility of adverse consequences of clinical breast examination beyond screening mammography. Consider using intervals of every 1–3 years in females aged 25–39 years and annually in females aged ≥ 40 years if it is performed. Perform clinical breast examination as part of evaluation in high-risk females and females with symptoms.

Benefits and comparative benefits of early detection and treatment — Randomized trials have established the effectiveness of screening mammography to reduce breast cancer mortality, with a meta-analysis reporting relative risk (RR) reductions by age: 0.88 (95% CI, 0.73–1.09; 9 trials) for women aged 39 to 49 years, 0.86 (95% CI, 0.68–0.97; 7 trials) for women aged 50 to 59 years, 0.67 (95% CI, 0.54–0.83; 5 trials) for women aged 60 to 69 years, and 0.80 (95% CI, 0.51–1.28; 3 trials) for women aged 70 to 74 years; an updated analysis of 3 Swedish screening trials reported a 15% relative reduction for women aged 40 to 74 years (RR, 0.85 [95% CI, 0.73–0.98]). Only 1 trial enrolled a significant proportion of Black women, and none of the trials nor the combined meta-analysis demonstrated a difference in all-cause mortality with screening mammography.

### Breast cancer screening for women at average risk: 2015 guideline update from the American cancer society [^115x6ZqZ]. JAMA (2015). Excellent credibility.

American Cancer Society 2015 — age to begin screening context: In determining initiation age, "the GDG considered 5-year age categories", and reported 5-year risk values for "women aged 45 to 49 years (0.9%)" and "women aged 40 to 44 years (0.6%)". The proportion of incident breast cancers is "ages 45 to 49 years and ages 50 to 54 years (10% and 12%, respectively), compared with women aged 40 to 44 years (6%)", and the distribution of breast cancer deaths is "10% and 11%, respectively), compared with women aged 40 to 44 years (7%)".

Regarding screening and diagnosis for breast cancer, more specifically with respect to indications for screening, average-risk females, ACOG 2017 guidelines recommend to do not continue or discontinue screening based on age alone. Decide on discontinuing screening mammography beyond age 75 years based on a shared decision-making process informed by the females health status and longevity.

### When would you screen this 39-year-old woman for breast cancer? Grand rounds discussion from beth Israel deaconess medical center [^115oW3EV]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death among women in the United States. Screening mammography, which aims to detect asymptomatic breast cancers at earlier and more intervenable stages, has reduced breast cancer mortality, but not overall mortality, in randomized trials. As of 2024, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force now recommends biennial screening mammography for women aged 40 to 74 years (grade B recommendation). In these rounds, 2 experts, the first a primary care physician and member of the Task Force and the second an epidemiologist and family practitioner, debate this recommendation in the context of Ms. R, a 39-year-old woman. They discuss the benefits and harms of breast cancer screening, the ideal age and frequency at which to conduct screening, and the key points to include when having a conversation with a patient about breast cancer screening.

### Personalized early detection and prevention of breast cancer: ENVISION consensus statement [^112XAf6Q]. Nature Reviews: Clinical Oncology (2020). High credibility.

Box 2 Summary of the key recommendations of the ENVISION

Assessment of breast cancer risk
Risk-assessment tools should be validated using prospective cohorts in the context in which they will be used and for each population ancestry.
Risk-assessment tools that enable better predictions of breast cancer subtype-specific risk and risk in women of non-European descent need to be developed and validated.
Discovery research to identify additional genetic variants and new markers is required to improve risk stratification.
The trade-off between the accuracy of comprehensive models and their usability at the population level should be evaluated.
Algorithm transparency should be ensured, with explicit reporting of the assumptions made.

Breast cancer prevention
Ways to better select high-risk women predisposed to breast cancer of poor prognosis need to be developed.
Clinically relevant surrogate markers (reflecting the field defect in breast tissues) that provide early indications of the effectiveness of the preventive measures in reducing incidence of breast cancer of poor prognosis need to be identified.
Programmes should incorporate healthy lifestyle recommendations for women at all risk levels.
Prevention-specific drug doses, schemes and schedules need to be defined, and rational drug repositioning strategies should be explored.
Better and early assessment of the acceptability of new preventive interventions is required.

Risk-stratified early detection
Discovery research is required to identify and validate early detection markers that can differentiate progressive from non-progressive breast cancers.
Develop risk-stratified early detection strategies underpinned by understanding of how the natural course of breast cancer, sensitivity of the test (for example, mammography) and the probability of overdiagnosis vary according to risk levels.
Optimize variables related to risk assessment (which risk factors to include, what age to start screening, how often to screen, and so on) and risk stratification (how many risk groups to specify and the risk threshold for each group), thus resulting in a cost-effective, feasible, acceptable and equitably accessible early detection programme.
Modelling studies can be used to inform on long-term population outcomes and the optimal design of risk-stratified early detection programmes.
Pragmatic randomized study designs, such as randomized health service studies, should be used to generate evidence on the effectiveness of risk-stratified early detection approaches in a given setting.

### Breast cancer screening for women at average risk: a recommendation from the Women's Preventive Services Initiative [^114jW2nH]. WPSI (2024). High credibility.

Implementation considerations for breast cancer screening emphasize shared decision-making and equity: "Decisions regarding when to initiate screening, how often to screen, and when to stop screening should be based on a periodic shared decision-making process involving the woman and her health care clinician". "The shared decision-making process assists women in making informed decisions and includes, but is not limited to, a discussion about the benefits and harms of screening, an assessment of the woman's values and preferences, and consideration of factors such as life expectancy, comorbidities, and health status". "Discussion and education related to screening should be culturally and linguistically congruent, particularly for patients experiencing health inequities". For higher-risk individuals, "Women considered at high risk of breast cancer (eg, previous diagnosis of breast or ovarian cancer, known BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation, previous high-dose radiation to the chest) may require additional testing and closer follow-up, which are beyond the scope of this recommendation".

Colorectal and breast cancer screening outcomes in older adults — meta-analyses quantify absolute benefits and harms over long time horizons. For colorectal cancer, "1,000 people would need to undergo at least two rounds of fecal occult blood testing to prevent one death from colorectal cancer in 10.3 years", with "one in 10" experiencing a false positive and colonoscopy complications occurring "in 3.1 per 1,000 individuals screened within 30 days of testing". For breast cancer, after "3 years, one death from breast cancer was prevented for every 5,000 women screened" and after "10.7 years, one death was prevented for 1,000 women screened", while harms include "one in 10 women" with a false-positive result, "one in 100" needing a biopsy, and "one in 1,000" undergoing unnecessary treatment; a Cochrane review found that "for every 2,000 women screened over a 10-year period, one would have her life prolonged, and 10 healthy women would be treated unnecessarily".

Numerous clinical studies have confirmed that screening women age 40 years and older reduces breast cancer mortality by 30% to 50%. Several factors including faster breast cancer growth rates and lower breast cancer incidence among younger women, as well as shorter life expectancy and more comorbid conditions among older women, should also be considered in screening guidelines. Annual screening beginning at age 40 years and continuing with no upper age limit, as long as a woman has a life expectancy of at least 5 years and no significant comorbid conditions, is currently recommended.

USPSTF breast cancer screening recommendations — For women aged 40 to 74 years, the USPSTF recommends biennial screening mammography (Grade: B). For women 75 years or older, the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening mammography (Grade: I statement). For women with dense breasts, the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of supplemental screening using breast ultrasonography or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) on an otherwise negative screening mammogram (Grade: I statement).
