## Question

What is the resorption timeframe for Phasix mesh?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the resorption timeframe for Phasix mesh made of poly-4-hydroxybutyrate (P4HB) in humans. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the highest-quality human data that explicitly states the in vivo resorption window. Then, I should verify whether preclinical biomechanical and histologic data corroborate that timeline. Next, I will reconcile any discrepancies across reviews or device variants and ensure I'm distinguishing molecular weight decline, strength loss, and complete mass resorption. Finally, I will synthesize a clear, clinically usable statement with appropriate caveats anchored to the best evidence.

> Let me first confirm the explicit human statement. The prospective, multicenter 60‑month JACS study reports that Phasix Mesh, comprised of P4HB, is essentially resorbed in 12 to 18 months, and this is the clearest directly stated human timeframe available [^116q36Pc] [^113vX5dv].

> I should double-check whether animal and materials data track with that window. In a porcine ventral hernia model, P4HB repairs showed progressive loss of mechanical contribution with repair strength approximating native tissue by 72 weeks, which is approximately 16 to 17 months, consistent with the upper bound of the 12 to 18 month human estimate and accompanied by marked molecular weight decline over time [^1163eZNj].

> Wait, let me verify short‑ and mid‑term histology to ensure the degradation course is indeed slow. Comparative porcine work noted that by 24 weeks Strattice was substantially remodeled whereas P4HB remained largely intact with a mild ongoing inflammatory response, implying a slower degradation trajectory for P4HB beyond six months that aligns with a 12 to 18 month resorption period [^1171a8wc].

> Hold on, I should reconcile a potential confusion in phrasing. The JACS paper notes modern resorbable materials overall span 4 to 36 months in resorption, but specifically identifies Phasix as essentially resorbed in 12 to 18 months; P4HB is therefore categorized as a long‑acting mesh relative to earlier faster‑resorbing polymers, and this "slow" degradation profile is echoed in both preclinical and review literature describing P4HB's relatively gradual loss of load‑bearing capacity [^116q36Pc] [^1139Ua9K] [^112yQPPs].

> I need to ensure I'm separating the concepts of molecular weight decline, loss of tensile strength, and complete mass resorption. P4HB shows molecular weight loss that precedes bulk mass loss, with load transfer to host tissue occurring progressively as the polymer degrades; this explains why mechanical parity with native tissue can occur around 16 months while the material is considered essentially resorbed within 12 to 18 months in vivo [^1163eZNj] [^1139Ua9K] [^112dKBP7].

> Next, I should review whether clinical outcome datasets align with the notion that by long‑term follow‑up the mesh is no longer mechanically active. The same prospective cohort interprets five‑year outcomes at a time when P4HB is not contributing to repair strength, with recurrence and complication rates reported in that context, reinforcing that functional support from the implant tapers off well before two years after implantation [^117J6EAZ] [^115vEx69] [^112vfsJi].

> But wait, what if variant constructs like Phasix ST at the hiatus behave differently. Although the anatomic site differs, Phasix ST shares the same P4HB load‑bearing core and is described with a predictable long‑term resorption profile; available hiatal reports do not contradict the 12 to 18 month resorption window for the underlying polymer in humans [^1139Ua9K] [^113vX5dv] [^11774c42].

> Putting this together, after checking human data, corroborative preclinical timelines, and the materials science sequence of degradation, the most defensible clinical statement is that Phasix mesh composed of P4HB is essentially resorbed within approximately 12 to 18 months in humans, with mechanical load transfer occurring progressively during that period [^116q36Pc] [^113vX5dv] [^1163eZNj].

Phasix mesh is a fully resorbable poly-4-hydroxybutyrate (P4HB) mesh that **resorbs over 12–18 months** [^116q36Pc] via hydrolysis [^112UNo5Q], with complete absorption typically by 18 months. It **retains most of its strength for the first 3–6 months**, then gradually loses strength as host tissue remodels and replaces the scaffold [^1163eZNj]. This resorption timeline is consistent across preclinical and clinical studies [^116q36Pc], supporting its use [^1139Ua9K] when temporary support with eventual full absorption is desired [^112DApit].

---

## Composition and degradation mechanism

Phasix mesh is composed of poly-4-hydroxybutyrate (P4HB), a biosynthetic polymer that **primarily degrades through hydrolysis** [^112UNo5Q], breaking down into biocompatible byproducts that are metabolized and eliminated by the body. This gradual process allows the mesh to provide mechanical support during the critical healing period before it is fully absorbed [^112DApit].

---

## Preclinical evidence on resorption timeline

Preclinical studies provide valuable insights into the resorption timeline of Phasix mesh [^1163eZNj]. In a porcine model of ventral hernia repair, Phasix mesh demonstrated a **predictable degradation profile**, with significant reduction in mechanical strength and molecular weight over time. The study found that **mechanical strength** was retained relative to native abdominal wall tissue at 8, 16, 32, and 48 weeks post-implantation, with strength gradually decreasing thereafter. The study also reported **complete resorption** by approximately 72 weeks (18 months), with the repaired tissue returning to its native mechanical properties. These preclinical findings indicate that Phasix mesh provides durable mechanical support during the critical healing period and is **fully resorbed within approximately 18 months**.

---

## Clinical evidence on resorption timeline

Clinical studies have corroborated the preclinical findings [^116q36Pc], consistently reporting that Phasix mesh is **fully resorbed within 12 to 18 months** post-implantation [^117J6EAZ]. A long-term, prospective, multicenter study evaluating Phasix mesh for ventral and incisional hernia repair found resorption within this timeframe. The study highlighted the unique advantage of Phasix mesh's long-term resorption profile [^116q36Pc], which allows for sustained mechanical support during tissue remodeling and gradual load transfer back to the abdominal wall.

---

## Factors influencing resorption rate

Several factors can **influence the resorption rate** of Phasix mesh, including [^112DApit]:

- **Patient-specific factors**: Age, metabolic rate, and overall health status may affect the rate of mesh degradation and absorption.
- **Surgical technique**: The method of mesh placement, fixation, and the extent of tissue integration can impact the resorption timeline.
- **Mesh size and thickness**: Larger or thicker meshes may take slightly longer to resorb completely compared to smaller or thinner meshes.

Despite these variables, the **overall resorption timeline of 12 to 18 months** remains consistent across clinical studies [^116q36Pc].

---

## Clinical implications of resorption timeline

The predictable resorption timeline of Phasix mesh has **important clinical implications**:

- **Temporary support**: The mesh provides temporary mechanical support during the critical healing period, reducing the risk of early hernia recurrence [^1139Ua9K].
- **Reduced long-term complications**: Complete resorption eliminates the presence of permanent foreign material, potentially reducing long-term complications such as chronic pain, infection, and mesh-related complications [^113vX5dv].
- **Patient satisfaction**: The gradual resorption and replacement by native tissue may improve patient satisfaction and quality of life outcomes [^1136HBMf].

## Summary of resorption timeline

| **Timeframe** | **Resorption status** | **Clinical implications** |
|-|-|-|
| 0–6 months | Mesh retains significant mechanical strength | Provides critical support during initial healing |
| 6–12 months | Gradual loss of mechanical strength [^1163eZNj] | Tissue remodeling and load transfer to native tissue |
| 12–18 months | Complete resorption [^116q36Pc] | - Mesh fully absorbed <br/> - Minimal long-term complications [^113vX5dv] |

---

Phasix mesh is **fully resorbed within 12 to 18 months** post-implantation, providing temporary mechanical support during the critical healing period [^1139Ua9K] with gradual load transfer back to native tissue. This predictable resorption timeline has been consistently demonstrated in both preclinical and clinical studies [^116q36Pc], making Phasix mesh a valuable option for hernia repair and other soft tissue reinforcement procedures.

### Evaluation of a fully absorbable poly-4-hydroxybutyrate/absorbable barrier composite mesh in a porcine model of ventral hernia repair [^1139Ua9K]. Surgical Endoscopy (2016). Low credibility.

As demonstrated through mechanical testing in this porcine study, the relatively slow degradation rate of the load-bearing component within Phasix™ ST and Phasix™ (P4HB) may be advantageous in facilitating a more gradual transfer of load from the mesh back to the native tissue compared to biologically derived or rapidly resorbing synthetic biomaterials. Rapid mechanical degradation of biomaterials could result in premature transfer of load back to the native tissue before the repair site has been fully remodeled and strengthened by mature collagen and may ultimately contribute to hernia recurrence rates. Within the Repair of Infected or Contaminated Hernias (RICH) clinical trial (NCT00617357), Itani et al. previously reported 28% hernia recurrence at 2 years following ventral hernia repair with biologically derived non-cross-linked porcine dermis (Strattice™) in CDC class II to IV patients. Within the Complex Open Bioabsorbable Reconstruction of the Abdominal Wall (COBRA) clinical trial (NCT01325792), Rosen et al. recently reported 17% hernia recurrence at 2 years following ventral hernia repair with a synthetic fully absorbable mesh (Gore® Bio-A®) in CDC class II to III patients. Additional clinical studies are warranted to determine whether rapid mechanical degradation of the devices evaluated ultimately contributed to the observed hernia recurrence rate and/or whether longer-term fully absorbable biosynthetics could improve upon these results.

The predictable, long-term resorption profile associated with Phasix™ ST and Phasix™ may also be beneficial in protecting the repair site.

### Characterization of poly-4-hydroxybutyrate mesh for hernia repair applications [^1163eZNj]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2013). Low credibility.

Phasix mesh is a fully resorbable implant for soft tissue reconstruction made from knitted poly-4-hydroxybutyrate monofilament fibers. The objectives of this study were to characterize the in vitro and in vivo mechanical and resorption properties of Phasix mesh over time and to assess the functional performance in a porcine model of abdominal hernia repair.

- **Materials and methods**: We evaluated accelerated in vitro degradation of Phasix mesh in 3 mol/L HCl through 120 hours of incubation. We also evaluated functional performance after the repair of a surgically created abdominal hernia defect in a porcine model through 72 weeks. Mechanical and molecular weight (MW) properties were fully characterized in both studies over time.

- **Results**: Phasix mesh demonstrated a significant reduction in mechanical strength and MW over 120 hours in the accelerated degradation in vitro test. In vivo, the Phasix mesh repair demonstrated 80%, 65%, 58%, 37%, and 18% greater strength compared with the native abdominal wall at 8, 16, 32, and 48 weeks post-implantation, respectively, and comparable repair strength at 72 weeks post-implantation despite a significant reduction in mesh MW over time.

- **Conclusions**: Both in vitro and in vivo data suggest that Phasix mesh provides a durable scaffold for mechanical reinforcement of soft tissue. Furthermore, a Phasix mesh surgical defect repair in a large animal model demonstrated successful transfer of load-bearing from the mesh to the repaired abdominal wall, thereby successfully returning the mechanical properties of repaired host tissue to its native state over an extended period.

### Long-term, prospective, multicenter study of poly-4-hydroxybutyrate mesh (Phasix mesh) for hernia repair in cohort at risk for complication: 60-month follow-up [^116q36Pc]. Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2022). High credibility.

Resorbable biomaterials have been used for abdominal wall reconstruction for decades, beginning with rapidly resorbing materials such as polyglactin 910 (a copolymer of glycolide and lactide) and polyglycolic acid. These materials resorb rapidly, lose mechanical strength, and have been used primarily for temporary abdominal closure or other staged repairs rather than long-term hernia repair. More recently, hernia meshes comprised of resorbable polymers such as polyglycolide, polylactide, trimethylene carbonate, ultra-pure fibroin derived from silk, and poly-4-hydroxybutyrate (P4HB) have been used in abdominal wall reconstruction. These materials have longer resorption periods ranging from 4 to 36 months. Phasix Mesh (comprised of P4HB) offers one of the longest resorption periods and is essentially resorbed in 12 to 18 months. In hernia repair, a long-term resorption profile represents a unique advantage, allowing the mesh to provide mechanical support to the repair site during the critical period of healing and tissue remodeling, preventing early recurrence, and gradually transferring the load back to the abdominal wall.

Several clinical studies have reported outcomes associated with P4HB mesh with a variety of hernia repair techniques and patient populations. The majority of these studies have reported medium-term outcomes in the range of 18 to 36 months. The study is uniquely designed to evaluate clinical outcomes of P4HB mesh along a continuum of early, intermediate, and long-term timeframes. Early and intermediate data have been published previously.

### Hiatus hernia repair with a new-generation biosynthetic mesh: a 4-year single-center experience [^115kQwg6]. Surgical Endoscopy (2023). Low credibility.

Between December 2017 and July 2022, 97 patients underwent hiatus hernia (HH) repair with biosynthetic mesh (BSM) reinforcement at our department. Basic patient demographics, preoperative symptom profiles, and details of the preoperative work-up are available. The predominant indication for surgery was a primary Type III hiatus hernia, accounting for 77% of cases. Emergencies and recurring hernias accounted for 8% and 13% of cases, respectively, with redo cases having a history of one or two previous HH repairs in 11% and 3% of cases, respectively.

Most patients underwent laparoscopic access surgery (92%) in an elective setting (92%). In all cases, a circular Phasix™ ST (BD) mesh was placed around the esophagus in a circular fashion and fixed with absorbable sutures. Detailed descriptions of surgical interventions, including all concomitant procedures, are provided.

- **Perioperative outcomes**: The median ICU and hospital stay was 0 days and 4 days, respectively. Only emergency cases required ICU care. An outcome without postoperative complications in elective primary, redo, and emergency cases was achieved in 88%, 100%, and 25% of cases, respectively. Mortality was 0% within 30 days after surgery. Overall morbidity (Clavien-Dindo grade ≥ 2) and severe morbidity (Clavien-Dindo grade ≥ 3b) were 15% and 3%, respectively. Perioperative morbidity was significantly higher in emergency cases (p < 0.05). No intraoperative complications were noted.

### Does bioabsorbable mesh reduce hiatal hernia recurrence rates? A meta-analysis [^115TDtKU]. Surgical Endoscopy (2023). Low credibility.

Use of bioabsorbable mesh at the hiatus is controversial, and long-term data are scant. We evaluated the world literature and performed a meta-analysis to determine if these meshes were effective in reducing recurrence.

- **Methods**: A literature search was performed using PubMed, MEDLINE, and ClinicalKey. We evaluated articles reporting on both Bio-A™ (polyglycolic acid:trimethylene carbonate-PGA:TMC) and Phasix™ (poly-4-hydroxybutyrate-P4HB) used at the hiatus. The DerSimonian-Laird random effects model was used to estimate the overall pooled treatment effect along with a 95% confidence interval (CI). Similar analysis was conducted to compare the clinical outcomes, i.e. recurrence rate, mean surgical time, mean hospital stay, and mean follow-up duration between non-mesh and mesh groups. The I² statistic was computed to assess the heterogeneity in effect sizes across the studies.

- **Results**: A total of 21 studies (12 mesh studies with 963 subjects and 9 non-mesh studies with 617 subjects) were included in the meta-analysis. There was one article reporting outcomes on P4HB mesh (73 subjects) and 11 on PGA:TMC mesh (890 subjects). The bioabsorbable mesh group had a significantly lower recurrence rate compared to the non-mesh group (8% vs. 18%; 95% CI 0.08–0.17), with a pooled p-value < 0.0001. Surgery time was shorter in the mesh group compared to the non-mesh group (136.4 min vs. 150 min) but not statistically significant (p = 0.54). There tended to be a more extended follow-up period after surgery in the non-mesh group compared to the mesh group (27 vs. 25.8 months).

### Long-term, prospective, multicenter study of poly-4-hydroxybutyrate mesh (Phasix mesh) for hernia repair in cohort at risk for complication: 60-month follow-up [^114YECLP]. Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2022). Low credibility.

Independent of mesh type, this study highlights variability in outcomes related to technique. Similar to other studies, patients undergoing preperitoneal or retrorectus repairs experienced fewer recurrences than those undergoing an onlay repair. Although this should not imply that onlay repairs should be abandoned, the use of a retrorectus technique is likely to reduce the risk of hernia recurrence in absorbable mesh hernia repairs.

Additional factors beyond mesh placement, such as the degree of overlap and mesh-to-defect ratio, similarly impact hernia outcomes. The placement of large meshes with significant overlap beyond the defects of a hernia is accepted as surgical dogma. This study demonstrated the impact of limited overlap on hernia recurrence rates. Patients with less than 10 cm of total mesh overlap relative to the defect in the longitudinal axis (5 cm on either side) had a threefold increase in hernia recurrence rates, which was even greater for patients with less than 5 cm of total longitudinal mesh overlap (2.5 cm on either side). Interestingly, lateral mesh overlap of less than 10 cm overall did not impact hernia recurrence rates, likely due to the offloading of midline tension associated with the hernia dissection. This suggests that the placement of mesh that extends both superior and inferior to the incision is an important aspect of hernia repair and may be a significant driver for hernia recurrences. Interestingly, among the onlay repairs in the study, many patients did not have mesh overlap extending above and below the defect. This might explain the increased recurrence rates observed.

Five-year outcomes after ventral and incisional hernia repair with P4HB mesh are associated with infrequent complications and durable hernia repair outcomes. Although limited by the extended study duration and associated loss to follow-up, this study provides a framework for anticipated long-term hernia repair outcomes when using P4HB mesh.

### Using mesh to reinforce the abdominal wall in abdominal free flaps for breast reconstruction: Is there a benefit? What are the risks [^1155MQEA]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Abdominal wall integrity may be compromised after abdominal flap harvest for breast reconstruction, leading to bulging or herniation due to weakening of the abdominal wall and dissection through the rectus muscle. Mesh can be used to reinforce the abdominal wall to reduce the risk of hernia formation postoperatively, especially in patients who may be at high risk. In this study, we describe this institution's experience with the use of mesh in the abdominal wall and critically evaluate its impact on patient outcomes and complications.

- **Methods**: We retrospectively reviewed all patients with an abdominal free flap harvested for breast reconstruction at Stanford Health Care from 2005 to 2015. Multivariate-adjusted logistic regression analysis was used to compare the odds of abdominal complications — infection, bulging, and herniation — between patients with and without an abdominal mesh implanted during breast reconstruction.

- **Results**: Three hundred eighty patients met inclusion criteria. One hundred sixty-one patients received mesh, whereas 219 received no reinforcement. In the mesh group, there were 7 (4.3%) cases of postoperative abdominal bulging, 11 (6.8%) cases of abdominal infection, and no (0.0%) cases of herniation. In the group without mesh, there were 17 (7.8%) cases of abdominal bulging, 11 (5.0%) cases of abdominal infection, and 5 (2.3%) cases of herniation. There was a significant difference in the odds of bulging (odds ratio [OR], 0.30; P = 0.01) but not in the odds of herniation (OR, 2.26E-10; P = 0.99) or infection.

### A current review of long-acting resorbable meshes in abdominal wall reconstruction [^112DApit]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Concern regarding chronic infection from permanent synthetic materials in contaminated and "high risk" ventral hernia repairs has prompted the development and dissemination of slowly resorbable biosynthetic materials. These materials are offered at a lower cost compared to their biologic mesh counterparts. This review examines the preclinical and clinical data available for each long-acting resorbable mesh, providing a candid comparison to biologic and synthetic equivalents.

### The importance of registries in the postmarketing surveillance of surgical meshes [^111grMkY]. Annals of Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

- **Unadjusted perioperative and 1-year follow-up outcomes and mesh type**: The influence of mesh types on perioperative and 1-year follow-up outcomes was assessed in this study.

- **Recurrence rate and mesh type**: Figure 2 illustrates the recurrence rate associated with different mesh types (P < 0.001).

- **Multivariable analyses**: The analysis model evaluated patient and procedure-related variables, including mesh type, sex, age, WHO obesity classification, ASA score, defect size and localization, defect closure, mesh size, fixation technique, re-operation history, preoperative pain, and risk factors on outcome variables. Results indicated that the type of mesh had no significant impact on intraoperative, postoperative surgical, and general complications, or on complication-related re-operations and pain at rest.

### Is a circular polypropylene mesh appropriate for application at the esophageal hiatus? Results from an experimental study in a porcine model [^1133TuQj]. Surgical Endoscopy (2009). Low credibility.

Mesh reinforcement in hiatal hernia surgery is debated. Randomized controlled trials have shown that recurrences may be reduced, but there is also the fear of mesh-related complications. Experimental studies on the characteristics of specific mesh types with regard to the risk of such complications are rare. The study aimed to investigate the properties of a circular heavy-weight polypropylene mesh in terms of stenosis, migration, erosions, and adhesions in a porcine model.

- **Methods**: A 55 x 55-mm heavy-weight polypropylene mesh with a 16.5-mm eccentric hole for the esophagus, corresponding to a calculated mesh area of 2811 mm² and a hole area of 214 mm², was implanted in nine German Landrace pigs. Six weeks later, the meshes were explanted and investigated for size, shrinkage, migration, and adhesions.

- **Results**: The total mesh area shrank to a mean of 2040 ± 178 mm² (p < 0.001), and the hole for the esophagus showed a trend toward an increase to 239 ± 38 mm² (p = 0.108). In not a single location did the mesh overhang the hiatal margin. The mean distance of retraction from the hiatal margin was 4.3 ± 2.8 mm. Therefore, no stenoses, migrations, or erosions occurred.

- **Conclusions**: A circular heavy-weight polypropylene mesh seems to be appropriate for the application at the esophageal hiatus in terms of safety and stability. This means that it is characterized by a position-stable centered fixation around the esophagus without a tendency toward stenosis, migration, or erosion.

### Long-term mesh erosion rate following abdominal robotic reconstructive pelvic floor surgery: a prospective study and overview of the literature [^111KoCHW]. International Urogynecology Journal (2020). Low credibility.

In this study, a monofilament and macroporous (> 75 μm, type I) mesh was used, allowing host cell colonization with collagen deposition, angiogenesis, and infiltration of leukocytes, resulting in good support and a reduced risk of infection. Research showed that synthetic meshes with smaller pores (type II and III) are associated with a higher erosion rate. It has been suggested that lightweight meshes might be less prone to erosion but may have a higher recurrence rate than heavy-weight grafts. Three studies show a 0% mesh erosion rate one year after the use of lightweight mesh. Studies with longer follow-ups or comparative studies for an abdominal prolapse repair, however, do not exist. Data on mesh usage with abdominal hernia repairs suggests an impact of the weight of the mesh, but the optimal balance between weight and porosity is unknown.

No significant difference is observed between synthetic and biological mesh in mesh-related complications. Evidence suggests, however, that recurrence rates are higher following a repair with biological mesh compared with synthetic mesh. To reduce the risk of mesh erosion, we administered preoperative antibiotics, dissected meticulously with strict monitoring of hemostasis to prevent a hematoma, attached the (type I) mesh, and closed the incised peritoneum over the mesh. Considering the numerous risk factors and prevention strategies, the occurrence of mesh erosion presumably has a multifactorial origin. Mesh erosion after laparoscopic ventral rectopexy has been described to occur in the rectum, vagina, or bladder.

### Resorbable mesh in the treatment of orbital floor fractures [^1141tXPF]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2001). Low credibility.

A variety of materials have been used to reconstruct defects of the orbital floor. Autogenous materials, such as bone and cartilage, have the obvious drawback of requiring a donor site, whereas alloplastic implants carry a potential risk of infection, particularly when in communication with the maxillary sinus. Consequently, there has been interest in the use of resorbable alloplastic material that acts as a barrier until completely degraded.

In this series, a total of 12 patients with orbital defects larger than 1 cm² were treated by the placement of a resorbable mesh plate of polyglycolic and polylactic acid (Lactosorb). Of the 12 patients treated, 3 were lost to follow-up. Of the remaining 9 patients, the mean follow-up was 6 months, with the longest follow-up being 15 months and the shortest 1 month. Two patients developed enophthalmos, measuring 2 mm using Hertel exophthalmometry, present in the early postoperative period (less than 1 month). The cause of the enophthalmos in both patients was attributed to a technical error in the placement of the mesh.

One patient developed an inflammatory reaction along the infraorbital rim, requiring implant removal at 7 months. From the above series, it is concluded that resorbable mesh is an acceptable material for reconstruction of the orbital floor in selected patients. It is believed that larger floor defects are better suited for nonresorbable alloplastic reconstruction, and that placement of the mesh over the infraorbital rim is unnecessary and places the patient at risk for local complications.

### Why I use mesh: a personal perspective [^114iPK94]. International Urogynecology Journal (2012). Low credibility.

The issue of using vaginally inserted polypropylene mesh is currently much debated. This personal view, stimulated by a live debate on the topic, sets out to examine some of the issues surrounding mesh and aims to encourage discussion of this matter.

### Intravascular tissue reactions induced by various types of bioabsorbable polymeric materials: Correlation between the degradation profiles and corresponding tissue reactions [^112dKBP7]. Neuroradiology (2010). Low credibility.

- **Polymer degradation (in vitro analysis)**: Figure 2 shows the mass remaining versus time plots for all nine polymers. Based on the data from mass loss, the degradation behavior of the nine polymer coils can be categorized into four groups: group 1 (Polysorb, 75/25 PGA/PLA, BondekPlus) lost 50% mass within 1 month; group 2 (Monocryl, Biosyn) lost 50% mass within 2 months; group 3 (25/72 PGA/PLA, Maxon, 90/10 PGA/PLA) lost 50% mass within 4 months; and group 4 (PLLA) did not lose significant mass during the 4-month period.

Figure 2 illustrates the mass loss of each material over time: 20 mg of each coil was immersed in 10 mL of PBS at 37°C (pH 7.4). Based on the data from mass loss, the degradation behavior can be categorized into four groups as described above.

Figure 3 shows the molecular weight degradation profile for each polymer. As expected, molecular weight loss precedes mass loss for each coil. In general, there is a correlation between mass loss and molecular weight loss data in terms of susceptibility to hydrolytic degradation. However, slight differences exist between the relative order of molecular weight loss and the order of mass loss.

- **Initial degradation phase**: We focused on the initial 14 days, where the most prominent rate of molecular weight loss was observed in every material.

### Mesh-related infections after hernia repair surgery [^115S3as4]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2005). Low credibility.

Clinicians have been challenged in recent years by a growing variety of novel non-infectious and infectious complications following the widespread use of meshes after open or laparoscopic hernia repairs. A mesh-related infection can occur weeks or even years after hernia repair. This possibility should be considered in any patient with a fever of unknown origin or symptoms and/or signs of inflammation of the abdominal wall following hernia repair. The reported incidence of mesh-related infections following hernia repair ranges from 1% to 8% across different series. This incidence is influenced by underlying co-morbidities, the type of mesh, the surgical technique, and the strategy used to prevent infections.

An approach that combines medical and surgical management is necessary in cases of mesh infection. The antimicrobial treatment regimen chosen initially should include coverage of Staphylococcus spp. and, particularly, Staphylococcus aureus.

### Degradation, infection and heat effects on polypropylene mesh for pelvic implantation: What was known and when it was known [^112hdC56]. International Urogynecology Journal (2011). Low credibility.

- **All other meshes/kits have FDA clearance letters dated after 2001**: In 2002, it was found that the extent of bacterial adherence depends on the mesh surface area. Multifilament meshes have a 205% increase in surface area compared to monofilament meshes, which may explain infections occurring months to years after implantation.

- **Heat sterilization causes degradation (2007)**: Figures 1 and 2 illustrate this. Figure 1 shows the control polypropylene mesh with a smooth surface and minimal striations as seen under SEM at 1500x magnification. This image is reprinted from The American Journal of Surgery, 195(3), by Kemal Serbetci et al, and shows the effects of resterilization on mechanical properties of polypropylene meshes, with permission from Elsevier and the author. Figure 2 depicts degradation after three autoclavings, highlighting more pronounced irregularities with small protrusions on the surface of the polypropylene fiber, also seen under SEM at 1500x.

- **Degradation in all currently used meshes (2010)**: Figures 3 and 4 demonstrate this. Figure 3 shows degradation of a non-knitted, non-woven mesh removed from a patient, viewed under SEM at 850x magnification. A nearly completely broken fiber can be seen in the center, with other degraded fibers exhibiting deep cracks in the background. Grateful acknowledgement is given to patient S. A. Y., who gave permission to reproduce this SEM image. Figure 4 depicts the degradation of a single polypropylene fiber seen in SEM at 1000x, noting the deep cracks within.

### Intravascular tissue reactions induced by various types of bioabsorbable polymeric materials: Correlation between the degradation profiles and corresponding tissue reactions [^115mE7yN]. Neuroradiology (2010). Low credibility.

Figure 3 illustrates the molecular weight loss of each material over time. The same procedure used for measuring mass loss was applied here; however, the remaining molecular weight was measured instead of mass. It is notable that the majority of the materials experienced their largest degree of molecular weight loss during the initial two weeks.

### Evaluation of a fully absorbable poly-4-hydroxybutyrate/absorbable barrier composite mesh in a porcine model of ventral hernia repair [^116QhrEj]. Surgical Endoscopy (2016). Low credibility.

- **Mesh/repair strengths at 12 and 24 weeks post-implantation**: The analysis of six of each mesh type per time point showed results for A) Phasix™ ST, B) Ventralight™ ST, C) Phasix™, and D) Strattice™ meshes. The data were presented as mean ± standard deviation. Mean ball burst strengths of meshes prior to implantation (T 0) and non-augmented weight (NAW) are indicated as dotted lines.

In contrast, Fig. 4B demonstrates that the mesh/repair strength of Ventralight™ ST at 12 weeks (331.9 ± 20.2 N) and 24 weeks (336.4 ± 42.1 N) remained similar to the T 0 strength of Ventralight™ ST alone. Additionally, no significant change in mesh/repair strength was observed for Ventralight™ ST between 12 and 24 weeks (+1%, p > 0.05). However, the mesh/repair strength of Ventralight™ ST was significantly greater than the NAW (76.0 ± 27.6 N) at both 12 and 24 weeks (p < 0.05). Moreover, the mesh/repair strength of Ventralight™ ST (336.4 ± 42.1 N) was significantly greater than Phasix™ ST (275.8 ± 59.6 N) at 24 weeks (p < 0.05).

- **Ball burst strengths of mesh-repaired sites at 12 and 24 weeks post-implantation**: This section evaluates A) the intraperitoneal plane (Phasix™ ST and Ventralight™ ST meshes) and B) the retromuscular plane (Phasix™ and Strattice™ meshes).

### Long-term, prospective, multicenter study of poly-4-hydroxybutyrate mesh (Phasix Mesh) for hernia repair in cohort at risk for complication: 60-month follow-up [^113vX5dv]. Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2022). High credibility.

Long-term resorbable mesh represents a promising technology for ventral and incisional hernia repair (VIHR). This study evaluates poly-4-hydroxybutyrate mesh (P4HB; Phasix Mesh) among comorbid patients with CDC class I wounds.

- **Study design**: This prospective, multi-institutional study evaluated P4HB VIHR in comorbid patients with CDC class I wounds. Primary outcomes included hernia recurrence and surgical site infection. Secondary outcomes included pain, device-related adverse events, quality of life, reoperation, procedure time, and length of stay. Evaluations were scheduled at 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, and 60 months. A time-to-event analysis (Kaplan-Meier) was performed for primary outcomes; secondary outcomes were reported as descriptive statistics.

- **Results**: A total of 121 patients (46 male, 75 female) with a mean age of 54.7 ± 12.0 years and a BMI of 32.2 ± 4.5 kg/m² underwent VIHR with P4HB Mesh. Fifty-four patients (44.6%) completed the 60-month follow-up. Primary outcomes (Kaplan-Meier estimates at 60 months) included recurrence (22.0 ± 4.5%; 95% CI 11.7% to 29.4%) and surgical site infection (10.1 ± 2.8%; 95% CI 3.3% to 14.0%). Secondary outcomes included seroma requiring intervention (n = 9), procedure time (167.9 ± 82.5 minutes), length of stay (5.3 ± 5.3 days), reoperation (18 of 121, 14.9%), visual analogue scale-pain (change from baseline -3.16 ± 3.35 cm at 60 months; n = 52), and Carolinas Comfort Total Score (change from baseline -24.3 ± 21.4 at 60 months; n = 52).

- **Conclusions**: Five-year outcomes after VIHR with P4HB mesh were associated with infrequent complications.

### Polypropylene mesh: Evidence for lack of carcinogenicity [^112wM9Wc]. International Urogynecology Journal (2014). Low credibility.

Tumors related to the implantation of surgical grade polypropylene in humans have never been reported. In this commentary, we present a balanced review of the information on what is known regarding the host response to polypropylene and provide data as to why the potential for carcinogenicity of polypropylene mesh is exceedingly small.

### Collaboration with the mesh industry: who needs who [^116sHXqG]. International Urogynecology Journal (2016). Low credibility.

The role of the patient is pivotal in this debate, as they are the ones with the most at stake. Determining what information is credible can be challenging for patients. Many women have experienced negative outcomes from new surgical techniques introduced too hastily into clinical practice. In social media, these experiences are disproportionately represented. Despite physicians stating that these "media" patients are not typical, other patients often identify with them.

Besides those who experience mesh complications, asymptomatic patients also suffer. They live daily with the worry that these severe complications might eventually affect them. Some question whether they should seek medical advice on having their mesh removed. Furthermore, women with pelvic organ prolapse, particularly those experiencing recurrences, may choose to endure their symptoms rather than undergoing a potentially hazardous surgical procedure.

### Long-term, prospective, multicenter study of poly-4-hydroxybutyrate mesh (Phasix mesh) for hernia repair in cohort at risk for complication: 60-month follow-up [^115vEx69]. Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2022). High credibility.

Postoperative outcomes

A total of 54 (44.6%) patients completed the study at the 60-month follow-up visit. The majority of the patients who did not complete the study were lost to follow-up after three attempts to contact them (n = 19). Another group of patients withdrew consent or chose to end their participation when the study period was extended (n = 12). Similarly, several study sites elected not to extend the study beyond the originally planned 24-month final time point, resulting in the removal of an additional six patients from later follow-up.

The primary outcomes of recurrence and SSI are summarized. Using Kaplan-Meier methods to account for censoring, the 60-month recurrence rates were estimated to be 22.0% ± 4.5% (mean ± SD; 95% CI 11.7% to 29.4%) for all patients treated with P4HB mesh. The number of patients remaining in the trial at each time interval is noted below the x-axis. On average, the time to recurrence was 771.6 ± 397.1 days (mean ± SD). A small number of patients experienced SSI. Again, using Kaplan-Meier methods to account for censoring, the 60-month SSI rates were estimated to be 10.1% ± 2.8% (mean ± SD; 95% CI 3.3% to 14.0%) for all patients treated with P4HB mesh. The average time to SSI was 15.2 ± 9.3 days (mean ± SD), and no SSIs were reported 37 days after implementation.

### Evaluation of a fully absorbable poly-4-hydroxybutyrate/absorbable barrier composite mesh in a porcine model of ventral hernia repair [^111ZejAQ]. Surgical Endoscopy (2016). Low credibility.

Although Phasix™ ST versus Strattice™ and Phasix™ versus Ventralight™ ST were not directly compared in the statistical analyses due to implantation in different tissue planes (i.e. intraperitoneal versus retromuscular), some interesting observations were made when reviewing the data for all meshes without regard to tissue plane. At 12 weeks, Ventralight™ ST (331.9 ± 20.2 N), Phasix™ ST (298.4 ± 24.7 N), and Phasix™ (271.4 ± 52.7 N) all displayed similar mesh/repair strength, which were approximately twice the strength exhibited by Strattice™ (140.4 ± 37.3 N). This trend continued at 24 weeks, with Ventralight™ ST (336.4 ± 42.1 N), Phasix™ ST (275.8 ± 59.6 N), and Phasix™ (317.1 ± 85.6 N) all displaying similar mesh/repair strength, which remained approximately 1.5–2 times the strength of Strattice™ (173.6 ± 51.1 N).

- **Histological analysis**: Figure 6 depicts representative photomicrographs of each mesh type at the time of explantation, demonstrating a comparable host tissue response regardless of mesh type. Additionally, table 1 shows similar inflammation, fibrosis, and neovascularization scores for all four mesh types at both of the time points evaluated, although unique differences are documented below.

### Guidelines for the management of hiatal hernia [^116DFu22]. Surgical Endoscopy (2013). High credibility.

Regarding surgical interventions for hiatal hernia, particularly with respect to technical considerations such as mesh use, the SAGES 2013 guidelines recommend using a mesh for the reinforcement of large hiatal hernia repairs to decrease the risk of short-term recurrence.

### Invited discussion on: mesh suspension thread for facial rejuvenation [^114SeKFZ]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2020). Low credibility.

The study is, for the most part, neatly conducted and summarized, for which the authors are to be commended. The technique and the mesh thread used are conceptually interesting as they introduce yet another way to increase the longevity of these types of minimally invasive sutures. The sample size of 21 responders is not insignificant, and some useful information can be gleaned from this.

We have, however, some issues with the interpretation of the results, the photographs used, and the lack of references cited regarding the history of barbed threads. Had they been correctly sourced, the narrative of the discussion may have changed. As it is, the discussion is somewhat skewed.

First, the photographs are inconsistent in the basics of both lighting and head positioning. Some were taken in shadow, but others not. Furthermore, only three patients (patients 2, 11, and 16) out of 21 responders were shown. It would have been more useful if the authors had illustrated all eight cases they deemed to have good results at 2 years, since the long-term results are the thrust of their paper.

### Hiatal hernia repair with biosynthetic mesh reinforcement: A qualitative systematic review [^114ActBs]. Surgical Endoscopy (2023). Low credibility.

Reinforcement of crural closure with synthetic resorbable mesh has been proposed to decrease recurrence rates after hiatal hernia repair but continues to be controversial. This systematic review aims to evaluate the safety, efficacy, and intermediate-term results of using biosynthetic mesh to augment the hiatus.

- **Methods**: The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines were followed throughout this systematic review. The Risk of Bias in Non-Randomized Studies of Interventions and Risk of Bias in Randomized Trials tools were used to perform a qualitative assessment of all studies included in this review. Recommendations were then summarized for the following pre-defined key items: protocol, research question, search strategy, study eligibility, data extraction, study design, risk of bias, publication bias, and statistical analysis.

- **Results**: The systematic literature search found 520 articles, of which 101 were duplicates, and 355 articles were determined to be unrelated to our study and excluded. The full text of the remaining 64 articles was thoroughly assessed. A total of 18 articles (1846 patients) were ultimately included in this review, describing hiatal hernia repair using three different biosynthetic meshes — BIO-A, Phasix ST, and polyglactin mesh. Mean operative time varied from 127 to 223 minutes. Mean follow-up varied from 12 to 54 months. There were no mesh erosions or explants. One mesh-related complication of stenosis requiring reoperation was reported with BIO-A. Studies showed significant improvement in symptoms and quality of life.

### Post-implantation alterations of polypropylene in the human [^115w1kkc]. The Journal of Urology (2012). Low credibility.

We reviewed the mechanisms by which polypropylene mesh changes after implantation in the human body.

- **Materials and methods**: The existing polymer and medical literature was reviewed regarding polypropylene, including its chemical characteristics, and compositional and physical properties, which undergo alteration after implantation at various human body locations. We also reviewed the changes in those physical properties that were demonstrable in explanted specimens.

- **Results**: Polypropylene in mesh form is commonly considered inert and without adverse reactions after implantation in humans. The literature suggests otherwise, with reports of various degrees of degradation, including depolymerization, cross-linking, oxidative degradation by free radicals, additive leaching, hydrolysis, stress cracking, and mesh shrinkage, along with infection, chronic inflammation, and the stimulation of sclerosis. Many substances added to polypropylene for various purposes during manufacture behave as toxic substances that are released during the degradation process. The material may also absorb various substances. These alterations in the chemical structure of polypropylene are responsible for visibly demonstrable fiber changes, resulting in the loss of structural integrity through material embrittlement. The heat of manufacturing polypropylene fibers begins the degradation process, which is augmented by the post-production heat used to flatten the mesh to prevent curling and attach anchoring appendages.

### Degradation, infection and heat effects on polypropylene mesh for pelvic implantation: What was known and when it was known [^111px5Xx]. International Urogynecology Journal (2011). Low credibility.

There has been a lack of dissemination of information regarding many of the characteristics of polypropylene mesh, especially the factors implicated in the complications that patients experience postoperatively. The first polypropylene mesh kit cleared by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for implantation was used in the transvaginal tape (TVT®) procedure for treating stress incontinence; this clearance was granted in 1998. Previously, in 1996, a woven polyester mesh kit was cleared, and further meshes and mesh kits were granted clearance in the ensuing years. All FDA information regarding clearance for marketing dates is available.

I will concentrate here on those factors known to influence the behavior of mesh in vivo until 2003, when many more new mesh kits were cleared by the FDA. Heat effects and degradation will be summarized.

### Precision in practice: The critical role of mesh and procedure type specification in urogynecological surgeries and research [^112NT33o]. International Urogynecology Journal (2024). Low credibility.

Recently, the debate surrounding the use of mesh in urogynecological procedures has intensified, leading to FDA warnings and heightened safety concerns. This clinical opinion emphasizes the vital need to specify mesh types in these procedures, drawing attention to the risk profiles and clinical outcomes associated with various meshes and the procedures that utilize them.

A significant issue identified in contemporary literature is the tendency to group diverse mesh types under the same umbrella, disregarding their unique characteristics and applications. We describe the range of mesh types, their application routes, and associated complications, highlighting the risks of this nonspecific approach to patient safety and informed decision-making.

We critically examine the generalization of mesh terminology in clinical and research dialogues. Concluding with specific recommendations for health care providers and researchers, the paper advocates for a more nuanced understanding and communication in the field, ultimately aiming to improve patient care and safety in urogynecological practice.

### Validation of a radiographic model for the assessment of mesh migration [^112s7aE4]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2011). Low credibility.

The natural history of laparoscopically placed mesh remains uncharacterized. Mesh migration is often discovered at reoperation and is implicated as a cause of hernia recurrence. It has also been associated with more serious complications, such as enteric and bladder erosion and fistula formation. There is no noninvasive method by which to reliably assess the in-vivo behavior of laparoscopically placed mesh. In this study, we devised and validated a safe and noninvasive model utilizing computed radiography (CR) for measuring postoperative mesh migration that may be applied to the clinical setting.

- **Methods**: The anatomical structures of the inguinal region were recreated using a skeletal male pelvic model. A sheet of commercially available surgical mesh, marked with three 5mm surgical clips at its medial and superior corners, was moved along the inguinal ligament wire for various random distances. The mesh displacement was measured from the model, and a CR film was obtained. The corresponding mesh displacement was then measured on the CR using two different calibration methods: calibration disk and clip measurement.

- **Results**: A total of 60 measurements were made and recorded. There were no statistically significant differences between the true distances (as measured from the model) and CR-measured distances of mesh migration. In comparing the two methods, only method 1 (calibration disk) showed a tendency towards a significant difference when lateral or superior displacement was measured, but correlation remained excellent (r² = 0.99).

### Editorial commentary: Fill it up: The fate of "absorbable" implants [^115r5eXD]. Arthroscopy (2019). Low credibility.

Surgeons make conscious decisions daily regarding implants, but do they really know what happens in the body to "absorbable anchors"? How long does it take to resorb, and what fills the space left behind? Absorbable materials can be very different, and well-done studies are important to help us understand the process and guide our decisions.

### Evaluation of long-term performance of an intraperitoneal biomaterial in the treatment of ventral hernias [^114VdrG5]. Surgical Endoscopy (2023). Low credibility.

- **Primary and secondary outcomes**: Through 30 days, no deaths were reported. Procedure-related events were observed in 5.0% (23/459) of patients, while reoperation occurred in 2.4% of patients. The rate of surgical site infections (SSI), surgical site occurrences (SSO), ileus, and readmission events was 2% or less. Through 2 years, SSOs requiring procedural intervention occurred in 2.6% (8/311; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.1%, 5.0%) of patients.

- **12-month device events**: At 12 months, 452 patients were available for follow-up. There were no reports of serious events such as mesh erosion, infection, excision/removal, exposure, migration, or shrinkage. There were also no device-related bowel obstructions, fistulas, hernia recurrence, seromas, known adhesion formation, bowel obstructions, bowel perforations, or unexplained or chronic pain. The percentage of patients with SSI and SSO were 2.2% and 3.1%, respectively.

- **Safety and patient-reported outcomes**: Through 3 years, 18.1% (83/459) of patients experienced outcomes related to safety and patient-reported measures.

### Evaluation of a fully absorbable poly-4-hydroxybutyrate/absorbable barrier composite mesh in a porcine model of ventral hernia repair [^1171a8wc]. Surgical Endoscopy (2016). Low credibility.

Interestingly, Strattice™ was also associated with significantly less inflammation at 24 weeks compared to Phasix™ mesh. This may be explained by the differing resorption profiles associated with these materials. As shown in Fig. 6, Strattice™ was significantly resorbed/remodeled by 24 weeks, while Phasix™ remained largely intact. Thus, the inflammatory response was absent/minimal for Strattice™, but remained an ongoing, mild response for Phasix™.

The results of this study compare well with similar, previously published studies. In 2013, Deeken et al. evaluated Phasix™ in a porcine model of hernia repair at 6, 12, 26, and 52 weeks post-implantation. The results were comparable to the study and showed that Phasix™-repaired sites were significantly stronger than NAW at all time points with a mild inflammatory response. In another study, Martin et al. evaluated Phasix™ in a porcine model at 8, 16, 32, and 48 weeks post-implantation. Again, the results were comparable to the study and showed that Phasix™-repaired sites were significantly stronger than NAW at 8 and 16 weeks and comparable to NAW thereafter, with a moderate inflammatory response present at all time points. In a third study, Monteiro et al. evaluated Strattice™ in a porcine model at 2, 4, and 6 weeks post-implantation. These results were also comparable to the results of Strattice™ in the study and showed a mild inflammatory response with rapid 40, 84, and 81% declines in mesh strength at 2, 4, and 6 weeks, respectively.

### Do newer-generation bioabsorbable screws become incorporated into bone at two years after ACL reconstruction with patellar tendon graft? A cohort study [^117RvaFu]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery. American Volume (2014). Low credibility.

Bioabsorbable interference screws are frequently used for graft fixation in ACL (anterior cruciate ligament) reconstruction. The resorption properties of many bioabsorbable screws available on the market are not well defined. The CALAXO (Smith & Nephew Endoscopy) and MILAGRO (DePuy Synthes) bioabsorbable screws contain polymers of poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) plus additives to encourage osseointegration over time. This study aimed to evaluate radiographic and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) properties and compare patient-reported outcomes at a minimum of two years of follow-up after ACL reconstruction using CALAXO or MILAGRO bioabsorbable interference screws.

- **Methods**: A cohort of patients who underwent ACL reconstruction with either CALAXO or MILAGRO screws returned for repeat radiographs to evaluate tunnel widening, MRI to assess graft integrity and screw breakdown, and completion of the pain and symptom items of the KOOS (Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score) questionnaire.

- **Results**: At a mean of three years (range, 2.5 to 4.0 years) post-surgery, thirty-one patients with sixty-two CALAXO screws and thirty-six patients with seventy-two MILAGRO screws returned for repeat evaluation. Two blinded, independent reviewers found no significant differences between the two screw types when comparing radiographs for tibial or femoral tunnel widening or MRIs for graft integrity, tibial and femoral foreign body reactions, or femoral screw degradation. Both reviewers found a significant d

### Resorbable synthetic meshes for abdominal wall defects in preclinical setting: A literature review [^112yQPPs]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2019). Low credibility.

Prosthetic materials for the repair of abdominal wall defects have been studied extensively to improve outcomes. A new approach is the use of a slowly resorbable synthetic mesh, which aims to combine the advantages of both synthetic and biological meshes. The objective of this review is to provide an overview of the physicochemical characteristics, and the biomechanical, histological, and macroscopic outcomes (such as recurrence and adhesion formation) of the use of resorbable synthetic meshes for the treatment and prevention of abdominal wall hernias, based on experimental studies.

- **Methods**: A systematic review was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Only experimental studies were included. Outcome parameters assessed included resorption, degradation, organization of connective tissue, inflammatory response, tensile strength, and amount of adhesion formation. Surgical characteristics, such as the type of defect, clean versus contaminated model, mesh position, defect repair, and recurrences, were also considered.

- **Results**: A total of eleven articles were included. Three absorbable synthetic meshes are currently available: GORE BIO-A mesh (Gore), TIGR Matrix Surgical mesh (Novus Scientific), and Phasix mesh (Bard). Two studies concluded that despite an early transient inflammatory reaction in the first months, remodeling was good in GORE BIO-A, 6–12 months after augmentation or suture line reinforcement, with only minimal to moderate adhesions when used intraperitoneally. The TIGR Matrix Surgical mesh shows only partial remo

### Analyzing material changes consistent with degradation of explanted polymeric hernia mesh related to clinical characteristics [^112tMc7J]. Surgical Endoscopy (2022). Low credibility.

Proposed mechanisms that potentially contribute to polypropylene mesh degradation after in vivo exposure include oxidizing species and mechanical strains induced by normal healing, tissue integration, muscle contraction, and the immediate and chronic inflammatory responses.

- **Methods**: This study explores these potential degradation mechanisms using 63 mesh implants retrieved from patients following a median implantation time of 24 months following hernia repair surgery (mesh explants) and analysis of multivariate associations between the material changes and clinical characteristics. Specifically, polypropylene mesh degradation was characterized in terms of material changes in surface oxidation, crystallinity, and mechanical properties, and clinical characteristics included mesh placement location, medical history, and mesh selection.

- **Results**: Compared to pristine control samples, subsets of mesh explants had evidence of surface oxidation, altered crystallinity, or changed mechanical properties. Using a multivariate statistical approach to control for clinical characteristics, infection was a significant factor affecting changes in mesh stiffness and mesh class was a significant factor affecting polypropylene crystallinity changes.

- **Conclusions**: Highly variable in vivo conditions expose mesh to mechanisms that alter clinical outcomes and potentially contribute to mesh degradation. These PP mesh explants after 0.5 to 13 years in vivo had measurable changes in surface chemistry, crystallinity, and mechanical properties, with significant trends associated with various factors.

### Does anchoring vaginal mesh increase the potential for correcting stress incontinence [^1128rh8R]. BMC Urology (2018). Low credibility.

- **Results**: Table 2 presents the baseline characteristics of the participants in the study groups. Maternal age and BMI were significantly higher among the mesh-operated patients (p < 0.001 and p = 0.004, respectively). The vast majority were postmenopausal in all groups; however, the highest rate was noticed disproportionately among those who had undergone mTVM (97%).

- **Participant characteristics**: All recruited patients presented for anterior compartment POP–Q II–III (pelvic organ prolapse) and genuine SUI (stress urinary incontinence). The modified transvaginal mesh (mTVM) group comprised patients who received a four–arm mesh that was fixed to the mid-urethra. Control groups I and II include historical controls who had participated in TVM and anterior colporrhaphy without any Kelly–Stoeckel suture, respectively.

- **Chronic systemic diseases**: Chronic systemic diseases include diabetes mellitus, airway diseases, and autoimmune diseases. There was a trend of patients with modified mesh having vaginal deliveries and vaginal operations at the highest rate; however, the differences between the groups were not significant. No significant differences were observed between groups in any type of chronic systemic diseases.

Table 3 lists the operative characteristics and complications, while Table 4 provides the odds and adjusted odds of the differences in baseline and surgical characteristics in the three study groups. The operation took a similar amount of time in the mTVM group as compared with the control groups.

### Nomenclature in abdominal wall hernias: Is it time for consensus [^113Fb4UB]. World Journal of Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Abdominal wall reconstruction is a rapidly evolving area of surgical interest. Due to the increasing prevalence and size of ventral hernias and the high recurrence rates, the academic community has become motivated to find the best reconstruction techniques. Whilst interrogating the abdominal wall reconstruction literature, we discovered an inconsistency in hernia nomenclature that must be addressed. The terms used to describe the anatomical planes of mesh implantation — 'inlay', 'sublay', and 'underlay' — are misinterpreted throughout.

- **Misinterpretation evidence**: We describe the misinterpretation of these terms and give evidence of where it exists in the literature.
- **Impact of misinterpretations**: Three critical arguments are presented as to why these misinterpretations hinder advances in abdominal wall reconstruction research.

The correct definitions of the anatomical planes and their respective terms are described and illustrated. Clearly defined nomenclature is required as academic surgeons strive to improve abdominal wall reconstruction outcomes and lower complication rates.

### Timing of repair and mesh use in traumatic abdominal wall defects: A systematic review and meta-analysis of current literature [^117DmMa3]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2019). Low credibility.

The included studies were critically appraised with a low inter-observer variation on their methodological quality using the predefined criteria, as summarized in Additional File 1 for the adjusted CONSORT checklist and Additional File 2 for the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. Overall, only the study by Honaker et al. was graded with a high-moderate quality of evidence; the five other articles scored between moderate-low and very low in the CONSORT checklist. With the Newcastle-Ottawa scale, all studies scored poor quality.

- **Treatment of TAWD**: In four of the studies included for analysis, most (> 75%) of the traumatic abdominal wall defects (TAWDs) were surgically repaired. Conversely, the studies by Coleman et al. and Netto et al. reported low surgical repair rates of 29% both. All the included studies reported on a diversity of reinforcement materials, including synthetic and biologic meshes. Besides these materials, Bender et al. used acellular dermis of cadavers, and Brenneman et al. reported on the use of autogenic tissue. Since Brenneman et al. utilized various different treatment strategies with different muscle flaps to cover the defect, this study was not included for further analysis on recurrence.

- **Type of repair**: Only Honaker et al. accounted for the decision between primary and mesh repair. In this study, defects were primarily repaired when there was sufficient tissue to achieve a tension-free reconstruction. A mesh was used when a tension-free closure could not be accomplished or when this was preferred by the surgeon over primary repair.

### Five-year outcomes from a prospective study on safety and efficacy of Phasix ST mesh use at the hiatus during paraesophageal hernia repair [^11774c42]. Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2024). High credibility.

Laparoscopic paraesophageal hernia (PEH) repair has a high hernia recurrence rate. The aim of this study was to assess the 5-year hernia recurrence rate after PEH repair using a combination of bioresorbable mesh and advanced surgical techniques to address tension as needed in a prospective group of patients.

- **Study design**: In 2016, a prospective database was established for 50 patients undergoing primary, elective PEH repair with a new bioresorbable mesh (Phasix ST). Intraoperatively, tension was addressed with Collis gastroplasty and diaphragm relaxing incisions as needed. All 50 patients from the initial study were tracked and asked to return for objective follow-up. Recurrence was considered present for any hernia more than 2 cm in size.

- **Results**: Objective follow-up was conducted in 27 of the original 50 (54%) patients at a median of 5.25 years after their PEH repair. Before the 5-year follow-up, 5 patients had a known recurrence. Objective evaluation at 5 years identified an additional 3 recurrences, for a total recurrence rate of 25% (8 of 32 patients). The hernia recurrence rate in patients with a Collis gastroplasty was significantly lower than in those without a Collis (7% vs 54%, p = 0.008). Two patients underwent reoperation for hernia recurrence. No patient had a mesh infection or mesh erosion.

- **Conclusions**: The combination of Phasix ST Mesh and tension-reducing techniques during PEH repair led to a 25% hernia recurrence rate at 5 years. The addition of a Collis gastroplasty led to significantly fewer hernia recurrences and is indicative of the effectiveness of this technique.

### Long-term, prospective, multicenter study of poly-4-hydroxybutyrate mesh (Phasix mesh) for hernia repair in cohort at risk for complication: 60-month follow-up [^112vfsJi]. Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2022). Low credibility.

The long-term evaluation of hernia repair outcomes in the US creates many challenges due to the healthcare delivery system and migratory population. This study provides unique long-term insight into the outcomes of ventral hernia repair five years after the procedure. Very few studies report on outcomes with a five-year duration of follow-up, and even fewer are prospective. This study highlights the challenges with hernia follow-up, as approximately 50% of the patients were evaluated at five years.

Nevertheless, this study offers important insight into outcomes among those undergoing repair with an absorbable P4HB mesh, at a timeframe when the mesh is no longer contributing to the strength of the repair. Approximately four out of five patients were free of hernia at the conclusion of the study. Among the 20 known recurrences, 12 patients underwent reoperation for hernia recurrence. These results are consistent with long-term recurrence and reoperation rates reported with synthetic mesh.

This study compares well with another study reporting on long-term outcomes with P4HB mesh. In a retrospective series of 31 patients with a median follow-up of 98 months, recurrences after P4HB repairs occurred in 12.9%, with a 10% reoperation rate. Additionally, the study provides insight into long-term complications associated with mesh. No mesh-related complications were identified beyond the early postoperative period, and none of the patients developed mesh infection or mesh-related complications throughout the entirety of the study period.

### Post-hysterectomy vaginal vault prolapse: Green-top guideline No. 46 [^112NdeQh]. RCOG (2015). High credibility.

Regarding surgical interventions for pelvic organ prolapse, particularly concerning mesh use, the BSUG/RCOG 2015 guidelines recommend fully informing patients of the permanent nature of the mesh and potential complications. Some complications are serious and may have long-term effects that are difficult to treat.

### Time-dependent changes of magnetic resonance imaging-visible mesh implants in patients [^111Tz8S8]. Investigative Radiology (2014). Low credibility.

Shrinkage and deformation of mesh implants used for hernia treatment can cause long-term complications. This study aimed to quantify noninvasively time-dependent mesh shrinkage, migration, and configuration changes in patients surgically treated for inguinal hernia using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-visible mesh implants.

In an agarose phantom, meshes in different shrinkage and folding conditions were used to validate the quantification process. Seven patients, surgically treated for inguinal hernia using iron-loaded mesh implants (3 bilaterally), were prospectively examined using MRI. Gradient echo sequences in sagittal and transverse orientations were performed on day 1 after surgery and at day 90. The mesh-induced signal voids were semiautomatically segmented, and a polygonal surface model was generated. A comparison of area and centroid position between the two calculated surfaces (day 1 vs day 90) was performed.

The phantom study revealed a maximum deviation of 3.6% between the MRI-based quantification and the actual mesh size. All 10 implants were successfully reconstructed. The mean (SD) observed mesh shrinkage 90 days after surgery was 20.9% (7.1%). The mean (SD) centroid movement was 1.17 (0.47) cm. Topographic analysis revealed mean (SD) local configuration changes of 0.23 (0.03) cm.

In conclusion, this study found significant mesh shrinkage (20.9%) but marginal changes in local mesh configuration within 90 days after mesh implantation, alongside a centroid shift of the mesh implant.

### The role of resorbable mesh as a fixation device in craniosynostosis [^112gGBcM]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

The purpose of the study was to present our experience with endocranial fixation using the Resorb-X mesh (KLS Martin, Jacksonville, FL) in frontoorbital reconstruction. A retrospective review of all patients who underwent frontoorbital advancement at our institution from 2003 to 2012 was performed. Inclusion criteria included pediatric patients who underwent frontoorbital advancement for craniosynostosis, patients treated for craniosynostosis only at our center, application of resorbable fixation devices only endocranially, and a follow-up of ≥ 2 years.

Patient evaluation included demographic information, postoperative complications, surgical outcomes, and postoperative computed tomographic imaging if accessible. Thirty-nine patients met the inclusion criteria; resorbable plates were used in 16 patients and Resorb-X mesh in 23 patients. Observed complications were unrelated to the fixation system used. Resorption of fixation devices was evident in all patients after 20 months following reconstruction. There were no incidents of local reaction to the fixation system. The frontoorbital area contour was deemed good in 24 patients and excellent in 15 patients by both families and the attending surgeon.

There was a statistically significant difference (P = 0.030) between patients ≤ 12 months and > 12 months regarding the complication rate. Endocranial fixation using the Resorb-X mesh is easily applicable, avoids material palpability, and provides stable and secure fixation. This technique is superior to conventional endocranial osseous fixation with absorbable plates.

### Evaluation of a fully absorbable poly-4-hydroxybutyrate/absorbable barrier composite mesh in a porcine model of ventral hernia repair [^115SxpxA]. Surgical Endoscopy (2016). Low credibility.

There are some limitations associated with the study that deserve consideration. First, the medium-term implant duration of 24 weeks is limited given the longer-term resorption profile associated with Phasix™ ST and Phasix™ compared to that associated with Strattice™. The results of this study provide an understanding of the short- to medium-term tissue response and mechanical properties associated with these materials. However, future studies should include longer implant durations to more fully characterize the responses associated with these materials after complete resorption of not only the barrier layer, but also the primary load-bearing structural component of the mesh. Additionally, although this study provides important insight using an established large animal model, the impact of mesh resorption on hernia recurrence rates and clinical performance should be addressed in future clinical trials.

Furthermore, there are some limitations associated with the T0 and NAW specimens chosen for this study. In future studies, it may be useful to also include a T0 sample of mesh/tissue repair strength immediately after surgical implantation of the mesh over a repaired defect in addition to the T0 mesh-only data acquired here. This type of specimen would provide additional insight into the contribution of the repaired tissue to the strength of the initial mesh/tissue repair prior to mesh resorption or tissue ingrowth.

Finally, it should be acknowledged that specimens obtained for histological analysis were taken after the completion of mechanical testing.

### Reconstruction of the immature craniofacial skeleton with a carbonated calcium phosphate bone cement: Interaction with bioresorbable mesh [^115ahh9u]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2003). Low credibility.

Calcium phosphate cements have been recently introduced for use in craniofacial reconstruction. In the clinical setting, however, pulsations of the underlying brain and dura may interfere with the crystallization of these cements, thereby rendering their use in cranioplasty problematic. To circumvent such problems, many clinicians have interposed synthetic resorbable plates or mesh between the dura and the cement. At the present time, however, little is known about the influence of such materials or their breakdown products on the fate of calcium phosphate cements.

The specific aim of this project was to evaluate the biocompatibility, osteoconductivity, and remodeling capacity of a calcium phosphate cement after implantation into experimental calvarial defects when combined with a resorbable mesh underlay. Four 10-mm diameter full-thickness calvarial defects (two frontal, two parietal) were created in each of six 3-week-old Yorkshire pigs. The defects were treated as follows:

- **Group treatments**:
	1. Empty control
	2. Macroporous polylactic acid (70/30 L/DL polylactic acid [PLA]) mesh
	3. Norian CRS calcium phosphate cement
	4. Norian CRS over PLA mesh underlay

Animals were divided into two groups. Half of the animals were killed 30 days after surgery, and half were killed 180 days after surgery. The graft recipient sites were examined histologically. At 30 days, minimal bone ingrowth was observed in untreated calvarial defects or in those that were treated with PLA plates alone. Defects treated with the cement alone demonstrated a modest amount of new woven bone deposition, primarily at the site of treatment.

### Does the use of bioabsorbable mesh for hiatal hernia repair at the time of bariatric surgery reduce recurrence rates? A meta-analysis [^113ZfxAp]. Surgery for Obesity and Related Diseases (2022). High credibility.

Anywhere from 16% to 37% of patients undergoing bariatric and metabolic surgery are estimated to have a hiatal hernia. To address the lack of long-term data showing the efficacy of bioabsorbable mesh in reducing the recurrence of hiatal hernia in patients who undergo bariatric surgery, we evaluated the world literature and performed a meta-analysis.

- **Objective**: To evaluate hiatal hernia recurrence rates after placement of bioabsorbable mesh in bariatric patients.

- **Setting**: Meta-analysis of world literature.

- **Methods**: We performed a literature search using PubMed and MEDLINE with search terms including "hiatal hernia recurrence", "bariatric surgery", "bioabsorbable mesh", "Gore BIO-A", and "trimethylene carbonate". Analysis was conducted to compare surgical time, length of stay, recurrence rate, hernia size, and changes in body mass index before and after surgery between mesh-group (MG) and nonmesh (NM) patients. The meta-analysis was described using standardized mean difference, weighted mean difference, effect size, and 95% confidence interval (CI). An I² statistic was computed to assess heterogeneity.

- **Results**: Twelve studies with 1351 patients were included in our meta-analysis. Four studies had both an MG and an NM group. There were 668 patients in the MG and 683 patients in the NM group. Hernia size noted in the NM group (7 cm²) was compared with that in the MG (6.5 cm²) (95% CI: 3.89–9.14; p = 0.86). The MG had fewer recurrences than the NM group (effect size, 2% versus 14%; 95% CI: -.26 to -.02; p = 0.027). The average follow-up was 28.8 months for the analysis.

### The use of synthetic mesh in reconstructive, revision, and cosmetic breast surgery [^115vXXvE]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Outpatient charts from this single private practice were reviewed retrospectively. Data collected included patient age, follow-up time, history of prior radiation, history of smoking, reasons for surgery, procedures performed, perioperative findings, postoperative complications, and need for postoperative interventions.

TIGR® Matrix Surgical Mesh is a macroporous mesh knitted from two different degradable fibers: a fast-degrading fiber and a slow-degrading fiber. The fast-degrading fiber is a copolymer between glycolide and trimethylene carbonate, and the slow-degrading fiber is mainly a copolymer between lactide and trimethylene carbonate. The materials used in TIGR® Matrix are well known from the suture industry and have been used clinically since 1970 in numerous medical devices. Both fibers degrade into small molecules that are readily absorbed and excreted from the body. The fast-degrading fiber provides extra support during the first wound-healing phase and is completely resorbed within four months after implantation. About two weeks after implantation, TIGR® Matrix gradually becomes softer and more flexible due to the ongoing degradation in the fast-degrading fiber, which unlocks the knitting pattern of the slow-degrading fiber. The slow-degrading fibers maintain their mechanics for up to six to nine months and are completely resorbed after approximately three years due to degradation by hydrolysis.

### Long-term, prospective, multicenter study of poly-4-hydroxybutyrate mesh (Phasix Mesh) for hernia repair in cohort at risk for complication: 60-month follow-up [^1136HBMf]. Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2022). Low credibility.

- **Primary and secondary study endpoints**: Kaplan-Meier curves were generated for hernia recurrence and surgical site infection (SSI) for all patients treated with poly-4-hydroxybutyrate mesh, with dotted lines representing the 95% confidence interval. Notably, there were no additional SSIs after 37 days. Other measures included the Visual Analogue Scale for Pain (mean), the Carolinas Comfort Scale–Total Score (mean), the SF-12 Physical Component Score (mean), and the SF-12 Mental Component Score (mean), with a significant p-value of less than 0.05 when comparing baseline with 60-month data.

Secondary endpoints comprised surgical procedure time, length of stay, reoperation rate, seroma requiring intervention, device-related adverse events, and quality-of-life assessments, all depicted in Figure 2 and Tables 3 and 4. Out of 20 hernia recurrences, slightly more than half required reoperation (n = 12), while 8 required no further action. Furthermore, six patients underwent reoperation due to SSI, intestinal perforation, hematoma, nontherapeutic laparotomy, or fat necrosis. The P4HB mesh was explanted at the time of reoperation in four patients. There was a single patient who underwent two reoperation procedures; the first for debridement of skin and subcutaneous tissue necrosis at 28 days post-implementation, and the second 1,023 days post-implementation due to hernia recurrence. Nine patients experienced seromas requiring intervention, with an average occurrence at 175.5 ± 382.3 days after implementation (expressed as mean ± SD). Device-related adverse events were determined by the individual investigators using their judgment, with some classifying recurrence as device-related.

### Long-term, prospective, multicenter study of poly-4-hydroxybutyrate mesh (Phasix Mesh) for hernia repair in cohort at risk for complication: 60-month follow-up [^117J6EAZ]. Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2022). High credibility.

Long-term resorbable mesh represents a promising technology for ventral and incisional hernia repair (VIHR). This study evaluates poly-4-hydroxybutyrate mesh (P4HB; Phasix Mesh) among comorbid patients with CDC class I wounds.

- **Study design**: This prospective, multi-institutional study evaluated P4HB VIHR in comorbid patients with CDC class I wounds. Primary outcomes included hernia recurrence and surgical site infection. Secondary outcomes included pain, device-related adverse events, quality of life, reoperation, procedure time, and length of stay. Evaluations were scheduled at 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, and 60 months. A time-to-event analysis (Kaplan-Meier) was performed for primary outcomes; secondary outcomes were reported as descriptive statistics.

- **Results**: A total of 121 patients (46 male, 75 female) 54.7 ± 12.0 years old with a BMI of 32.2 ± 4.5 kg/m² underwent VIHR with P4HB Mesh (mean ± SD). Fifty-four patients (44.6%) completed the 60-month follow-up. Primary outcomes (Kaplan-Meier estimates at 60 months) included recurrence (22.0 ± 4.5%; 95% CI 11.7% to 29.4%) and surgical site infection (10.1 ± 2.8%; 95% CI 3.3 to 14.0). Secondary outcomes included seroma requiring intervention (n = 9), procedure time (167.9 ± 82.5 minutes), length of stay (5.3 ± 5.3 days), reoperation (18 of 121, 14.9%), visual analogue scale–pain (change from baseline –3.16 ± 3.35 cm at 60 months; n = 52), and Carolinas Comfort Total Score (change from baseline –24.3 ± 21.4 at 60 months; n = 52).

Five-year outcomes after VIHR with P4HB mesh were associated with…

### Site-specific prolapse surgery. II. Vaginal paravaginal repair augmented with either synthetic mesh or remodelling xenograft [^112DVbdK]. International Urogynecology Journal (2011). Low credibility.

From a research perspective, pelvic reconstructive surgeons do not appear to have grasped some profound differences between the various biomaterials available for prolapse repair. In essence, surgical implants are designed to reattach an avulsed structure to the body wall by attracting the ingrowth of soft tissue. When considering tissue augmentation, it is intuitive to select an inert permanent material, such as synthetic mesh (e.g. polypropylene and polyester); however, such prostheses always evoke an acute foreign body inflammatory reaction. The subsequent healing response is shaped by two main factors: pore size/accessibility and device motion at the implantation site.

Placing macroporous monofilament (Amid Type I) mesh within immobile tissues generally results in strong vascular and connective tissue ingrowth ("incorporation"). However, poor fixation of an implant can lead instead to excessive shearing stress against host tissue, resulting in micro-bursa formation and poor fixation. Biomaterials scientists in the early 1990s deliberately tanned various cadaveric and animal tissues with glutaraldehyde or hexamethylene diisocyanate to delay or permanently retard collagen turnover. But "leatherizing" these biological materials failed to produce the "natural" scaffolds that manufacturers sought. Clinical outcomes were paradoxical. Graft-to-tissue bonding is relatively weak, analogous to healing around a microporous or multifilament (Amid Type II or III) synthetic mesh. Moreover, there is a potential for subsequent graft autolysis, leading to automatic support failure.

### Precision in practice: The critical role of mesh and procedure type specification in urogynecological surgeries and research [^114x4QUC]. International Urogynecology Journal (2024). High credibility.

Recently, the debate surrounding the use of mesh in urogynecological procedures has intensified, leading to FDA warnings and heightened safety concerns. This clinical opinion emphasizes the vital need to specify mesh types in these procedures, drawing attention to the risk profiles and clinical outcomes associated with various meshes and the procedures that utilize them. A significant issue identified in contemporary literature is the tendency to group diverse mesh types under the same umbrella, disregarding their unique characteristics and applications. We describe the range of mesh types, their application routes, and associated complications, highlighting the risks of this nonspecific approach to patient safety and informed decision-making.

We critically examine the generalization of mesh terminology in clinical and research dialogues. Concluding with specific recommendations for health care providers and researchers, the paper advocates for a more nuanced understanding and communication in the field, ultimately aiming to improve patient care and safety in urogynecological practice.

### Long-term, prospective, multicenter study of poly-4-hydroxybutyrate mesh (Phasix mesh) for hernia repair in cohort at risk for complication: 60-month follow-up [^11524y3Q]. Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2022). High credibility.

The methods for this trial have been described in previous publications and are repeated here for clarity. This study represents a prospective, multicenter, open-label study to assess the safety, performance, and outcomes of poly-4-hydroxybutyrate mesh (Phasix Mesh, CR Bard, Inc) for primary ventral, incisional, or multiple hernia repairs in a cohort at risk for complications.

Patients were considered at risk for complications with one or more of the following comorbidities: BMI between 30 and 40 kg/m² (inclusive), active smokers, COPD, diabetes mellitus, immunosuppression, coronary artery disease, chronic corticosteroid use (more than six months of systemic use), hypoalbuminemia (preoperative serum albumin less than 3.4 g/dL), advanced age (75 years or more), or renal insufficiency (serum creatinine concentration 2.5 mg/dL or more). Patients, investigators, and surgeons were not blinded to study treatment. The study was designed to treat 120 patients at 16 US sites.

The protocol was approved by the IRB at each institution, and all patients provided informed consent before enrollment. Recruitment occurred through the surgical offices of the investigators from October 2013 to January 2015. Investigators were selected based on experience with hernia repair techniques. No specific training was required for participation due to the similarity in technique required for P4HB mesh relative to other meshes.

### In vivo response to polypropylene following implantation in animal models: A review of biocompatibility [^115ZYnzM]. International Urogynecology Journal (2017). Low credibility.

All foreign materials are associated with a chronic inflammatory reaction, which varies depending on specific factors, including patient characteristics. Therefore, implanting foreign materials will never be completely risk-free. A material that degrades over time is not associated with the same level of risk, as the inflammatory reaction would normally be expected to resolve once complete degradation has occurred. The view is that the only material type that truly meets the definition of biocompatibility is one that resorbs fully over time.

Mesh-related complications due to host response issues have proven particularly difficult to manage in certain patients. This has led to research into the feasibility of using fully resorbable meshes for tissue repair. The use of this technology has been explored as far back as the 1980s, with initially poor results for long-term mechanical support and the resultant high recurrence rates. Resorbable meshes have been shown to have a comparable acute inflammatory response to polypropylene. However, none of the types of resorbable meshes investigated have resulted in adequate tissue incorporation. As a result, resorbable meshes were deemed unsatisfactory when prolonged tensile strength is required, such as that needed for the treatment of SUI and POP.

Recent improvements have been reported by Hjort et al. using a novel resorbable material, namely a copolymer of glycolide, lactide, and trimethylene. Following implantation in the abdomen of a sheep model, strong connective tissue was observed.

### Comparative long-term performance of biologic, synthetic, and long-acting resorbable meshes in ventral hernia repair: Population survival kinetics approach [^111Gxp9Q]. Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2025). Low credibility.

Long-term follow-up outcomes of ventral hernia repairs (VHRs) with meshes are unavailable. Knowledge of these meshes at distant time points will be useful in selecting the optimal mesh for VHRs. Our study aims to develop a highly accurate model to validate and predict long-term recurrence data of open VHRs and further determine the optimal timing of follow-up for different VHRs with different meshes.

- **Study design**: Using population survival kinetics, one-phase non-linear regression analysis (NLRA) was used to determine the overall time-to-recurrence for repairs with all three mesh types. Time-to-recurrence was used to validate and predict the year-over-year recurrence data for each specific mesh type.

- **Results**: The model found the median overall time-to-recurrence to be longest for long-acting resorbable meshes (166.4 months), followed by synthetic meshes (132.1 months), and shortest for biologic meshes (80 months). At 5 years, about 41% of VHRs with biologic meshes, 27% with synthetic meshes, and 22% with long-acting resorbable meshes are expected to fail due to recurrence; at 10 years, these rates will rise to 65%, 47%, and 39%, respectively. Biologic meshes will have the highest proportion of "at-risk" repairs (42%). At 15-years post-repair, 98–99% of the remaining unrecurred VHRs in the biologic and synthetic meshes will remain intact beyond that time point. Patients who had VHR with biologic and synthetic mesh should be evaluated for recurrence every 6 months for 2 years, then yearly up to 15 years. Patients repaired with long-acting resorbable meshes should be evaluated…

### Poly-4-hydroxybutyrate (phasix™) mesh onlay in complex abdominal wall repair [^112UNo5Q]. Surgical Endoscopy (2021). Low credibility.

Poly-4-hydroxybutyric acid (P4HB, Phasix™) is a biosynthetic polymer that degrades by hydrolysis and can be woven into a mesh for use in soft tissue reinforcement. Herein, we describe our initial experience performing complex abdominal wall repair (CAWR) utilizing component separation and P4HB mesh as onlay reinforcement.

- **Methods**: All patients undergoing CAWR between June 2014 and May 2017 were followed prospectively for postoperative outcomes. Only those patients who underwent component separation with primary repair of the fascial edges followed by onlay of P4HB mesh were included in this study.

- **Results**: 105 patients (52 male, 53 female; mean age 59.2 years, range 22–84) met inclusion criteria. Mean BMI was 29.1 (range 16–48); 52% of patients had prior attempted hernia repair, most with multiple medical comorbidities (71% of patients with ASA 3 or greater). 30% of cases were not clean at the time of repair (CDC class 2 or greater). Median follow-up was 36 months (range 9–63). Eighteen patients (17%) developed a hernia recurrence ranging from 2 to 36 months postoperatively. Five (5%) patients developed a localized superficial infection treated with antibiotics, three (2.8%) required re-operation for non-healing wounds, and six (6%) patients developed seroma.

- **Conclusions**: These data demonstrate a relatively low rate of hernia recurrence, seroma, and other common complications of CAWR in a highly morbid patient population. Importantly, the rate of mesh infection was low, and no patients required complete mesh removal, even when placed into a contaminated or infected area.
