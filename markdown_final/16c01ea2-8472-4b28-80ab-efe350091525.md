## Question

folate vs folic acid

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how folate and folic acid compare, covering definitions, metabolism, bioavailability, efficacy, dosing, safety, population factors, and practical recommendations. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about precise chemical definitions and forms in foods versus supplements. Then, I should verify human metabolic handling and bioavailability differences. Next, I will examine evidence for clinical indications and dosing, followed by safety and special populations. Finally, I will synthesize pragmatic recommendations and highlight knowledge gaps that could change practice, anchoring each step to high‑credibility sources where available [^1119t4Zd] [^11118rKA].

> Let me first confirm the definitions, because if I blur "folate" and "folic acid", downstream reasoning will be shaky: natural folates are reduced, often polyglutamated vitamers present in foods, whereas folic acid is the fully oxidized, synthetic monoglutamate used in supplements and fortification; this difference matters for stability, transport, and enzymology in one‑carbon metabolism and nucleotide synthesis [^116DrzF4] [^111JZjKw].

> Wait, let me verify prevailing assumptions about metabolism before I jump to conclusions: I initially thought physiologic folic acid is fully reduced and methylated in the intestinal mucosa like natural folates, but portal‑vein sampling in humans with TIPSS showed that shortly after ingestion the majority of folic acid appears unmetabolized in portal blood, whereas reduced folates are efficiently converted to 5‑MTHF, indicating limited human mucosal DHFR capacity and permitting unmetabolized folic acid (UMFA) to reach the systemic circulation [^111Kt6Dz] [^112DozGv].

> I should double‑check bioavailability comparisons next: controlled interventions show natural food folates are substantially less bioavailable than folic acid, with spinach and yeast folates achieving only about 30–60% of folic acid's effect on serum folate and homocysteine, and biomarker dose‑response meta‑analysis suggests a near‑linear increase up to roughly 400 µg/day; additionally, [6S]-5‑MTHF can raise RBC folate more than equimolar folic acid in women of childbearing age, which may be relevant for selected patients [^112wmagr] [^115px56A] [^113XaANC].

> Next, I will examine clinical indications and standard dosing, and I should confirm guideline alignment: for primary prevention of neural tube defects (NTDs), USPSTF and ACOG recommend 400–800 µg/day folic acid beginning at least one month preconception through the first 12 weeks, with population modeling linking RBC folate distributions to predicted NTD risk and older dose‑response estimates predicting larger risk reduction with higher intakes within practical ranges [^1119t4Zd] [^11118rKA] [^113WHLww] [^116ey7BZ].

> Hold on, I should verify high‑risk dosing because misquoting here would misguide care: ACOG recommends 4 mg/day folic acid for those with a prior NTD‑affected pregnancy or other high‑risk conditions starting three months preconception through 12 weeks' gestation under medical supervision, while hematology guidance also acknowledges lower prophylactic doses in pregnancy for deficiency prevention in routine contexts; these are distinct use‑cases and should not be conflated [^116hvZfQ] [^1121YRwi].

> Let me consider duration beyond the first trimester and make sure I'm not extrapolating: randomized trials show that continuing 400 µg/day after 12 weeks prevents the second‑ and third‑trimester decline in maternal folate and rise in homocysteine, raises cord folate, and in extended follow‑up to 11 years is associated with benefits in child neurocognitive outcomes including language processing; although guidelines focus on NTD prevention in early pregnancy, this signals potential additional benefits without identified harms at this dose [^111aNkik] [^113WoeXx].

> I need to ensure safety is framed correctly and not over- or understated: the most established risk is masking of vitamin B12 deficiency, underlying the 1,000 µg/day tolerable upper intake level and necessitating attention to B12 status when folate intakes are high; observational and mechanistic data indicate folate‑B12 interactions during pregnancy, and high‑dose regimens generate higher circulating UMFA without clear additional benefit on RBC folate, so caution and B12 awareness are prudent, particularly in older adults and in pregnancy when high doses are contemplated [^117Y2RSi] [^1121YRwi] [^115GivUp] [^117362pX].

> But wait, what about cancer signals and UMFA — am I overinterpreting? A large adenoma trial showed more advanced lesions with 1 mg/day folic acid versus placebo, and long‑standing concerns exist about promoting progression of preexisting neoplasia, yet an NIH workshop concluded human evidence linking high folic acid, UMFA, or elevated folate status to adverse outcomes remains inconclusive; balanced counseling should acknowledge uncertainty while emphasizing clear NTD prevention benefits at recommended doses [^115QJ2cX] [^1153JoBA] [^113rku9w].

> I should confirm epigenetic considerations without overclaiming causality: folate drives one‑carbon methylation, and trials in unfortified settings show modest, selective changes in blood DNA methylation with 400–800 µg/day and raise the broader question of how chronic high folic acid exposure influences methylation dynamics; UMFA appears in human milk, and recent work mapping intestinal transporters found no dysregulation with 400 µg/day over 16 weeks, but the clinical impact of chronic UMFA exposure remains to be clarified [^116SZQGn] [^113DyJCK] [^113pXY7H] [^112zFPCu].

> Next, I should review population‑specific modifiers, because one size rarely fits all: MTHFR C677T genotype influences folate and homocysteine responses — with TT individuals often showing lower folate and incomplete homocysteine normalization at low doses — and racial/ethnic disparities persist in serum folate despite fortification, with Black, Hispanic, and Asian/Pacific Islander women more likely to have low levels and some groups showing smaller biomarker responses to supplements; comorbidities like alcohol use disorder, IBD, celiac disease, and post‑surgical states can impair absorption and may justify tailored strategies [^114nVspg] [^113yGnRQ] [^112k3n7L].

> Let me reconsider formulation and regimen choices to ensure practicality: daily folic acid remains standard due to stability and proven efficacy, but [6S]-5‑MTHF can be considered for select nonresponders or those with malabsorption, natural food folates require higher amounts given lower bioavailability, and while weekly regimens (for example 2.8 mg/week) can raise RBC folate and likely reduce NTD risk, daily 400 µg generally produces greater biomarker improvements and is easier to align with existing guidance [^113XaANC] [^112wmagr] [^117NtMEi] [^116bXGgd].

> I should now synthesize clinical recommendations while double‑checking alignment with evidence: for all who could become pregnant, use 400–800 µg/day folic acid starting at least one month before conception through 12 weeks; for high NTD risk, use 4 mg/day under supervision from three months preconception through 12 weeks; consider continuing 400 µg/day thereafter given maternal and child neurocognitive benefits seen in trials; avoid exceeding 1,000 µg/day chronically without indication and ensure B12 sufficiency when intakes are high or neurologic symptoms are present [^1119t4Zd] [^11118rKA] [^116hvZfQ] [^111aNkik].

> Hold on, I should verify that these recommendations acknowledge uncertainties and research needs: current evidence gaps include the long‑term clinical significance of UMFA, dose‑ and timing‑specific epigenetic effects, and whether upper limits should vary by B12 status; expert commentaries advocate nuanced, genotype‑ and context‑aware policies and application of the precautionary principle while preserving proven NTD prevention — sensible positions that support monitoring and targeted research rather than wholesale changes today [^113rku9w] [^115PKCFC] [^115MFV7X].

> In sum — let me make sure I'm not missing a key point — natural folates and synthetic folic acid differ in chemistry, metabolism, and bioavailability; folic acid at guideline doses prevents NTDs and remains the standard, with selective use of [6S]-5‑MTHF reasonable in special cases, safety centers on avoiding B12 masking and unnecessary high doses, and continued 400 µg/day through pregnancy is defensible based on randomized data showing maternal and child benefits, while we continue to study UMFA, epigenetics, and population heterogeneity to refine policy and practice [^111Kt6Dz] [^1119t4Zd] [^113WoeXx].

Folate is the natural, reduced form of vitamin B9 found in foods, while folic acid is the synthetic, oxidized form used in supplements and fortification [^116DrzF4]. Folic acid is **more stable** and about **1.7 times more bioavailable** [^112wmagr] than food folate, but it requires reduction by dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) [^111Kt6Dz], which is slow and variable, leading to unmetabolized folic acid (UMFA) in plasma at intakes above ~200–400 µg/day [^112DozGv]. UMFA may **mask B12 deficiency** [^111Kt6Dz] [^1126ZCtY] and has **uncertain long-term risks** [^113rku9w], so intake should stay below the 1,000 µg/day UL [^117Y2RSi] unless medically indicated. For NTD prevention, **400–800 µg/day folic acid** [^1119t4Zd] is recommended for women who could become pregnant, with **4 mg/day for high-risk women** [^116hvZfQ]; 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (5-MTHF) is an alternative for those with MTHFR variants or concerns about UMFA.

---

## Chemical structure and stability

**Folate** refers to naturally occurring, reduced forms (e.g. 5-methyltetrahydrofolate [5-MTHF]) with polyglutamate tails that are labile and sensitive to heat, light, and oxidation [^116DrzF4]. **Folic acid** is the synthetic, fully oxidized pteroylmonoglutamic acid, which is highly stable and used in supplements and fortification [^116DrzF4].

---

## Bioavailability and absorption

**Folate** has lower bioavailability (~50–60%) due to polyglutamate hydrolysis and instability [^112wmagr], whereas **folic acid** has higher bioavailability (~85–100%) owing to its stability and efficient absorption [^112wmagr] [^115px56A].

---

## Metabolism and unmetabolized folic acid (UMFA)

**Folate** is rapidly converted to 5-MTHF in the gut and liver, entering circulation as the active form [^111Kt6Dz]. **Folic acid** requires reduction by DHFR [^111Kt6Dz] to DHF/THF, followed by methylation to 5-MTHF; because DHFR activity is slow and variable, UMFA appears in plasma at intakes > ~200–400 µg/day [^112DozGv].

---

## Physiological roles and health implications

Both forms support DNA synthesis, repair, and methylation, and prevent megaloblastic anemia and NTDs [^116DrzF4]. Folic acid is **more effective for rapid status improvement and NTD prevention** because of its higher bioavailability and stability [^116DrzF4] [^116ey7BZ].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

| **Population** | **Folate (natural)** | **Folic acid (synthetic)** |
|-|-|-|
| General adult population | Emphasize dietary intake (400 µg DFE/day) | Supplementation not routinely recommended |
| Women of reproductive age | Dietary intake encouraged | 400–800 µg/day recommended for NTD prevention [^1119t4Zd] |
| High-risk pregnancy (previous NTD) | Dietary intake encouraged | 4 mg/day recommended [^116hvZfQ] |
| Individuals with MTHFR polymorphisms | 5-MTHF supplementation recommended | Folic acid less effective due to impaired conversion |

---

## Potential risks and adverse effects

**Folate** is generally safe, and excess intake rarely causes adverse effects. **Folic acid** in excess (> 1,000 µg/day) [^117Y2RSi] may **mask B12 deficiency** [^1126ZCtY], cause **UMFA accumulation** [^111Kt6Dz], and may have **uncertain long-term risks** [^113rku9w] (e.g. cancer promotion [^115QJ2cX], cognitive effects).

---

## Special populations and considerations

- **Pregnancy**: Folic acid supplementation is critical for NTD prevention [^1119t4Zd]; continued supplementation may benefit neurocognitive development [^113WoeXx].

- **Elderly**: Excess folic acid [^111Kt6Dz] may mask B12 deficiency and worsen cognitive decline [^1126ZCtY].

- **Genetic polymorphisms**: MTHFR variants reduce folic acid conversion [^114nVspg]; 5-MTHF is preferred.

---

## Summary of key differences

| **Characteristic** | **Folate (natural)** | **Folic acid (synthetic)** |
|-|-|-|
| Source | Naturally occurring in foods [^116DrzF4] | Synthetic; supplements/fortification [^116DrzF4] |
| Stability | Labile; sensitive to heat/light [^116DrzF4] | Highly stable |
| Bioavailability | Lower (~50–60%) [^112wmagr] | Higher (~85–100%) [^115px56A] |
| Metabolism | Rapid conversion to 5-MTHF [^111Kt6Dz] | Slow DHFR-dependent conversion [^112DozGv] |
| UMFA presence | None | Present at higher intakes [^112DozGv] |
| Clinical use | Dietary intake emphasized | Supplementation for NTD prevention [^1119t4Zd] |

Folate and folic acid are distinct in structure, stability, bioavailability, and metabolism. Folic acid is **more effective for rapid status improvement and NTD prevention** [^116ey7BZ], but excess intake can cause UMFA accumulation [^112DozGv] and mask B12 deficiency [^1126ZCtY]. Recommendations should balance benefits and risks, with 5-MTHF considered for those with MTHFR variants [^113XaANC] or UMFA concerns [^112DozGv].

### Red blood cell folate concentrations increase more after supplementation with [6S]-5-methyltetrahydrofolate than with folic acid in women of childbearing age [^113XaANC]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2006). Low credibility.

For the primary prevention of neural tube defects (NTDs), public health authorities recommend that women of childbearing age take 400 micrograms (mcg) of folic acid per day, starting four weeks before conception and continuing during the first trimester. The biologically active derivative [6S]-5-methyltetrahydrofolate ([6S]-5-MTHF) might serve as an alternative to folic acid.

- **Objective**: We investigated the effect of supplementation with [6S]-5-MTHF compared to that of folic acid on red blood cell folate concentration, an indicator of folate status.

- **Design**: The study was designed as a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled intervention trial. Healthy women (n = 144) aged 19–33 years received 400 mcg of folic acid, the equimolar amount of [6S]-5-MTHF (416 mcg), 208 mcg [6S]-5-MTHF, or placebo as a daily supplement for 24 weeks. Red blood cell and plasma folate concentrations were measured at baseline and at four-week intervals.

- **Results**: The increase in red blood cell folate over time was significantly higher in the group receiving 416 mcg [6S]-5-MTHF daily than in the groups receiving 400 mcg folic acid daily or 208 mcg [6S]-5-MTHF daily (P < 0.05), demonstrating that [6S]-5-MTHF may be more effective for increasing folate levels over the same period.

### Folic acid handling by the human gut: Implications for food fortification and supplementation [^111Kt6Dz]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2014). Low credibility.

Thinking, which is based mainly on rodent studies, is that physiologic doses of folic acid (pterylmonoglutamic acid), such as dietary vitamin folates, are biotransformed in the intestinal mucosa and transferred to the portal vein as the natural circulating plasma folate, 5-methyltetrahydrofolic acid (5-MTHF), before entering the liver and the wider systemic blood supply.

- **Objective**: We tested the assumption that, in humans, folic acid is biotransformed (reduced and methylated) to 5-MTHF in the intestinal mucosa.

- **Design**: We conducted a crossover study in which we sampled portal and peripheral veins for labeled folate concentrations after oral ingestion with physiologic doses of stable-isotope-labeled folic acid or the reduced folate 5-formyltetrahydrofolic acid (5-FormylTHF) in 6 subjects with a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPSS) in situ. The TIPSS allowed blood samples to be taken from the portal vein.

- **Results**: Fifteen minutes following a dose of folic acid, 80 ± 12% of labeled folate in the hepatic portal vein was unmodified folic acid. In contrast, following a dose of labeled 5-FormylTHF, only 4 ± 18% of labeled folate in the portal vein was unmodified 5-FormylTHF, and the rest had been converted to 5-MTHF after 15 minutes postdose.

- **Conclusions**: The human gut appears to have a very efficient capacity to convert reduced dietary folates to 5-MTHF but limited ability to reduce folic acid. Therefore, large amounts of unmodified folic acid in the portal vein are probably attributable to an extremely limited mucosal cell dihydrofolate reductase.

### Effects of maternal folic acid supplementation during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy on neurocognitive development in the child: an 11-year follow-up from a randomised controlled trial [^113WoeXx]. BMC Medicine (2021). High credibility.

In summary, our findings in the children of participants in a randomised trial in pregnancy add considerably to the existing evidence from observational studies that have linked maternal folate status in pregnancy with neurocognitive outcomes in the child. We examined the effect of FA intervention in trimesters 2 and 3 of pregnancy (in women taking FA as recommended in the first trimester) and provide the first randomised trial evidence that continued FA supplementation (400 μg/day) throughout pregnancy can influence cognitive performance and brain function of the child up to 11 years of age.

In addition to using standardised IQ tests to measure child cognition, we applied magnetoencephalographic brain imaging for the first time in a study of this kind, and the findings not only reinforce our previous findings of cognitive benefits in these children at 3 and 7 years but provide new evidence of a specific role of prenatal FA in semantic processing of language. The totality of evidence has important impacts in informing new policy and clinical practice in relation to FA use in pregnancy.

Whereas recommendations for NTD prevention in the UK and most countries worldwide advise mothers to take FA supplements from before conceiving until the end of the 12th gestational week only, our findings suggest that continued FA intervention in pregnancy beyond the early period required to prevent NTD is beneficial to neurocognitive development in the child. In a wider context, we demonstrate the application of MEG as a non-invasive tool in paediatric research.

### Impact of folic acid supplementation on the epigenetic profile in healthy unfortified individuals - a randomized intervention trial [^116SZQGn]. Epigenetics (2024). High credibility.

Folic acid fortification of staple foods has been introduced in many countries globally to prevent neural tube defects in newborns, as this birth defect results from a folate deficiency in women around the time of conception. While the mechanisms underlying the link between low folate levels in the mother and the failure to close the spina bifida in the fetus have not been fully clarified, it is likely that epigenetic mechanisms play a role. Folate is an essential mediator in one-carbon metabolism, which provides methyl groups for DNA synthesis and methylation. The availability of active methyl groups can be influenced by diet and uptake of folic acid, as well as other key players in one-carbon metabolism, such as choline and methionine. Folate deficiency may correlate with hypomethylation. Conversely, high folate levels may be associated with hypermethylation; however, research in this area is lacking. If folic acid fortification affects DNA methylation, this might be associated with disease initiation or promotion. Hence, it is important to understand the impact of folic acid intake on DNA methylation.

### Physiological need for calcium, iron, and folic acid for women of various subpopulations during pregnancy and beyond [^116s74RT]. Journal of Women's Health (2021). Low credibility.

Women tend to supplement their diets with multivitamin/mineral (MVM) supplements more often than men, and reports indicate that more than 90% of pregnant women in the United States supplement their diets with prenatal MVMs. Given the widespread use of MVMs among women and the increasing efforts to unveil the importance of phenotype-specific health determinants, it seems imperative to review what is known about variations in nutrient physiology among women from different ethnic and racial groups and at different reproductive stages of life. In this study, we embark on an assessment of the scientific evidence and knowledge gaps that impact the precise determination of nutrient levels (specifically calcium, iron, and folic acid) that confer benefits to various subpopulations of women in the United States.

### Impact of continuing folic acid after the first trimester of pregnancy: Findings of a randomized trial of folic acid supplementation in the second and third trimesters [^111aNkik]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2013).

Supplementation with folic acid (FA) is recommended worldwide before and during early pregnancy because of its proven effect in preventing neural tube defects. However, the role of FA after the 12th gestational week (GW) is much less clear.

- **Objective**: We investigated maternal folate and homocysteine responses and related effects in the newborn that resulted from continued FA supplementation after the first trimester of pregnancy.

- **Design**: Pregnant women, aged 18–35 years, who were attending an antenatal clinic in Northern Ireland with singleton uncomplicated pregnancies and reported taking FA supplements in the first trimester were randomly assigned at the start of trimester 2 to receive 400 μg FA per day or a placebo capsule.

- **Results**: A total of 119 women (60 women in the placebo group; 59 women in the treatment group) completed the trial. From GWs 14–36, mean (± SD) serum folate decreased (from 45.7 ± 21.3 to 19.5 ± 16.5 nmol/L; P < 0.001) in unsupplemented women, whereas plasma homocysteine increased (6.6 ± 2.3 to 7.6 ± 2.3 μmol/L; P < 0.001). However, FA supplementation prevented these changes and resulted in a significant increase in red blood cell folate concentrations from 1203 ± 639 to 1746 ± 683 nmol/L (P < 0.001; GWs 14–36). Cord blood folate was significantly higher in the FA group than in the placebo group (red blood cell concentrations of 1993 ± 862 and 1418 ± 557 nmol/L, respectively; P = 0.001).

- **Conclusions**: Continued supplementation with 400 μg FA per day in trimesters 2 and 3 of pregnancy can increase maternal and cord blood folate status and prevent the increase…

### Low-dose daily folic acid (400 μg) supplementation does not affect regulation of folate transporters found present throughout the terminal ileum and colon of humans: a randomized clinical trial [^112zFPCu]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2024). High credibility.

Folic acid supplementation during the periconceptional period reduces the risk of neural tube defects in infants, but concerns over chronic folic acid exposure remain. An improved understanding of folate absorption may clarify potential risks. Folate transporters have been characterized in the small intestine, but less so in the colon of healthy, free-living humans. The impact of folic acid fortification or supplementation on the regulation of these transporters along the intestinal tract is unknown.

- **Objective**: The objective was to characterize the expression of folate transporters/receptor (FT/R) and folate hydrolase, glutamate carboxypeptidase II (GCPII), from the terminal ileum and throughout the colon of adults and assess the impact of supplemental folic acid.

- **Methods**: In this 16-week open-labeled randomized clinical trial, adults consumed a low folic acid-containing diet, a folate-free multivitamin, and either a 400 μg folic acid supplement or no folic acid supplement. Dietary intakes and blood were assessed at baseline, 8 weeks, and 16 weeks (time of colonoscopy). Messenger RNA (mRNA) expression and protein expression of FT/R and GCPII were assessed in the terminal ileum, cecum, and ascending and descending colon.

- **Results**: Among 24 randomly assigned subjects, no differences in dietary folate intake or blood folate were observed at baseline. Mean ± SD red blood cell folate at 16 weeks was 1765 ± 426 and 911 ± 242 nmol/L in the 400 and 0 μg folic acid group, respectively (P < 0.0001). Reduced folate carrier, proton-coupled folate transporter, and folate-receptor alpha expression were evaluated, with findings suggesting…

### Folic acid supplementation, dietary folate intake during pregnancy and risk for spontaneous preterm delivery: a prospective observational cohort study [^114fVksn]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2014). Low credibility.

One possible explanation for these conflicting results could be the dosage of folic acid. While most of the studies finding an association with gestational length or PTD were based on high doses of folic acid (≥ 5000 μg/d, ≥ 2500 μg/d, and ≥ 500 μg/d), only two women in our study population consumed as much as 5000 μg/d of supplemental folic acid, while only 10% consumed > 500 μg/d and 16% consumed > 400 μg/d. However, the Hungarian RCT, one of the largest performed so far, did not find any effect of a high dosage of 800 μg/d of periconceptional folic acid supplementation on PTD. Unfortunately, the folic acid dosage was not indicated in all of the studies.

The assessment of folate intake from supplementation alone or when studying populations with different dietary folate intakes are additional factors compromising comparability between studies. While recent US studies are performed against the background of mandatory folate fortification of food, other studies have examined supplementation effects in folate-deficient populations. Few studies have assessed the effects of both dietary folate and folic acid supplementation separately or combined, and adjustments for bioavailability are rare. In this Norwegian study population, only 3% of the participants reached the Nordic Nutrition Recommendation of 500 μg/d with their dietary folate intake, and 44% of the participants achieved the recommended level with their dietary folate and supplemental folic acid intake. After stratification for dietary folate intake, the early initiation of folic acid supplementation was significantly associated with reduced risk of spontaneous preterm delivery.

### Folic acid for the prevention of colorectal adenomas: A randomized clinical trial [^115QJ2cX]. JAMA (2007). High credibility.

Laboratory and epidemiological data suggest that folic acid may have an antineoplastic effect in the large intestine. The objective of this study was to assess the safety and efficacy of folic acid supplementation for preventing colorectal adenomas.

The study was designed as a double-blind, placebo-controlled, two-factor, phase 3, randomized clinical trial conducted at nine clinical centers between July 6, 1994, and October 1, 2004. Participants included 1,021 men and women with a recent history of colorectal adenomas and no previous invasive large intestine carcinoma.

Participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive 1 mg/d of folic acid (n = 516) or placebo (n = 505) and were separately randomized to receive aspirin (81 or 325 mg/d) or placebo. Follow-up consisted of two colonoscopic surveillance cycles, with the first interval at three years and the second at three or five years later.

- **Main outcome measures**: The primary outcome measure was the occurrence of at least one colorectal adenoma. Secondary outcomes included the occurrence of advanced lesions (≥ 25% villous features, high-grade dysplasia, size ≥ 1 cm, or invasive cancer) and adenoma multiplicity (0, 1–2, or ≥ 3 adenomas).

During the first three years, 987 participants (96.7%) underwent colonoscopic follow-up. The incidence of at least one colorectal adenoma was 44.1% for those receiving folic acid (n = 221) and 42.4% for those receiving a placebo (n = 206) [unadjusted risk ratio (RR), 1.04; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.90–1.20; p = 0.58]. The incidence of at least one advanced lesion was 11.4% for the folic acid group (n = 57) and 8.6% for the placebo group.

### Folate, vitamin B12, one carbon metabolism and the nervous system: Excess folic acid is potentially harmful [^1126ZCtY]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2025). High credibility.

Folate, vitamin B12, and one carbon metabolism are fundamental to genetics, epigenetics, and nervous system development and brain health at all ages. The neuropsychiatric complications of deficiency or inborn errors of folate and vitamin B12 are well documented, but there has been controversy about whether excess folic acid is also harmful to the nervous system, especially in the presence of vitamin B12 deficiency. There is now substantial and consistent clinical, epidemiological, and experimental evidence that excess folic acid is potentially harmful to the nervous system. Recent experimental evidence confirms that both folate deficiency and excess impair cortical neurogenesis, and this effect is greatest when vitamin B12 deficiency is combined with excess folic acid.

Excess folic acid increases the demand for vitamin B12 and aggravates the block in the folate cycle resulting from vitamin B12 deficiency. The balance between folate and vitamin B12 is crucial to methylation, genetics, and epigenetics. Both folate deficiency and excess may impair cellular differentiation and nervous system development through hypomethylation or hypermethylation of genes. In countries with folic acid fortification policies, many subjects are exposed to excess folate. The long-term genetic, epigenetic, and transgenerational implications are yet to be clarified. The safe upper limit (UL) of folic acid should be reconsidered in relation to the vitamin B12 status of individuals and populations. The combination of natural folate together with vitamin B12 would greatly improve the benefits and reduce the harms.

### International expert consensus on micronutrient supplement use during the early life course [^116p2A8i]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Low credibility.

There was strong consensus for folic acid supplement use during the preconception period and the first trimester, which aligns with existing guidelines recommending supplemental folic acid (vitamin B9) to reduce the risk of neural tube defects (NTDs). Obstetricians and gynaecologists are generally aware of the importance of folic acid intake during these periods; however, they may be less aware of its role in preventing other congenital defects as a substrate in one-carbon metabolism.

In addition, folic acid supplement use during early pregnancy (4 weeks before to 8 weeks after conception) appears to benefit the neurocognitive development of the child. However, the potential advantages of folic acid supplement use beyond the first trimester are unclear. A recent systematic review and meta-analysis (three randomized controlled trials [RCTs] and 17 cohort studies) has shown that folic acid supplement use during pregnancy was associated with a lower risk of pre-eclampsia, although the timing of supplement use was not specified.

Folic acid supplement use after the first trimester has been shown to increase maternal and cord blood folate levels and prevent the increase in homocysteine normally seen late in the second and third trimesters. However, given that these studies did not include pregnancy outcomes and that guidelines only cover preconception and early pregnancy, the lack of consensus for folic acid during the third trimester may be expected.

### Folate dietary insufficiency and folic acid supplementation similarly impair metabolism and compromise hematopoiesis [^115TCRks]. Haematologica (2017). Low credibility.

While dietary folate deficiency is associated with an increased risk for birth defects and other diseases, evidence suggests that supplementation with folic acid can contribute to predisposition to some diseases, including immune dysfunction and cancer. Herein, we show that diets supplemented with folic acid, both below and above the recommended levels, led to significantly altered metabolism in multiple tissues in mice. Surprisingly, both low and excessive dietary folate induced similar metabolic changes, which were particularly evident for nucleotide biosynthetic pathways in B-progenitor cells. Diet-induced metabolic changes in these cells partially phenocopied those observed in mice treated with anti-folate drugs, suggesting that both deficiency and excessive levels of dietary folic acid compromise folate-dependent biosynthetic pathways. Both folate deficiency and excessive dietary folate levels compromise hematopoiesis, resulting in defective cell cycle progression, persistent DNA damage, and impaired production of lymphocytes. These defects reduce the reconstitution potential in transplantation settings and increase radiation-induced mortality. We conclude that excessive folic acid supplementation can metabolically mimic dietary folate insufficiency, leading to similar functional impairment of hematopoiesis.

### Impact of folic acid supplementation on the epigenetic profile in healthy unfortified individuals - a randomized intervention trial [^113DyJCK]. Epigenetics (2024). High credibility.

Previous studies have pointed to an increased need for folate among carriers of the (MTHFR)-C677T variant. We did not detect differences according to the MTHFR variants; however, our study participants had adequate folate blood levels prior to intervention despite the lack of folic acid fortification programmes in Germany.

Our study was modest in sample size and duration, limiting statistical power and generalizability of the results. However, we were able to test two regimens of folic acid interventions, 400 and 800 µg. Our modest study size precluded adjustment for potential confounding of the association between AgeAccel and folate levels, and between changes in these measures over follow-up. While the observed associations may be driven by common causes of change in AgeAccel and folate levels, our study characterizes shared longitudinal variation. Future investigations may illuminate what factors contribute to the observed correlations.

In summary, we observe few and select differences in PBL DNA methylation patterns following supplementation with folic acid in a population with adequate folate levels.

### Periconceptional intake of folic acid among low-risk women in Canada: Summary of a workshop aiming to align prenatal folic acid supplement composition with current expert guidelines [^116XmFP7]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2018). Low credibility.

The workshop commenced with a series of presentations to provide a foundational understanding of the history of periconceptional folic acid (FA) supplementation, guidelines, folate status, and FA intake of Canadian women, as well as the benefits and potential risks associated with prenatal FA supplementation. These topics are summarized below.

- **Recommended dose of FA for primary prevention of NTDs**: Specifically, the workshop outlined the suggested dosage of FA for effectively preventing neural tube defects (NTDs).

### Early pregnancy folate-cobalamin interactions and their effects on cobalamin status and hematologic variables throughout pregnancy [^115GivUp]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2018). Low credibility.

Periconception folic acid supplementation is widespread, but how it interacts with cobalamin status is rarely considered.

- **Objective**: The aim of this study was to investigate whether first-trimester folate-cobalamin interactions affect pregnancy cobalamin status, hematologic variables, and pregnancy outcomes.

- **Design**: In the longitudinal Reus-Tarragona Birth Cohort study from less than 12 gestational weeks throughout pregnancy, fasting plasma and red blood cell (RBC) folate, plasma cobalamin, holotranscobalamin (holoTC), methylmalonic acid (MMA), total homocysteine (tHcy), hemoglobin, mean cell volume (MCV), post-glucose-load serum glucose, gestational hypertension, gestational age at birth, and birth weight were recorded in 563 participants.

- **Results**: The highest plasma folate concentrations occurred in the first trimester when folic acid supplement use was extensive. Supplementation beyond the first trimester interacted with time of pregnancy on plasma folate, RBC folate, and tHcy throughout pregnancy (P-interaction < 0.001). Plasma folate and RBC folate were higher and tHcy was lower in continued supplement users than in nonusers. Elevated plasma folate (≥ 30 nmol/L) occurred in 78.9% of women who exceeded the recommended 400 µg folic acid/d. First-trimester folate-cobalamin status interactions were associated with MMA (P-interaction < 0.001) throughout pregnancy. When plasma cobalamin was suboptimal (≤ 221 pmol/L; n = 36), participants with elevated plasma folate (n = 11) had higher MMA concentrations than those with non-elevated plasma folate (n = 23).

### Impact of high-dose folic acid supplementation in pregnancy on biomarkers of folate status and 1-carbon metabolism: An ancillary study of the Folic Acid Clinical Trial (FACT) [^117362pX]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2021). High credibility.

Periconceptional folic acid (FA) supplementation is recommended to prevent the occurrence of neural tube defects. Currently, most over-the-counter FA supplements in Canada and the United States contain 1 mg FA, and some women are prescribed 5 mg FA/d. High-dose FA is hypothesized to impair 1-carbon metabolism. We aimed to determine folate and 1-carbon metabolism biomarkers in pregnant women exposed to 1 mg or 5 mg FA.

- **Objectives**: This was an ancillary study within the Folic Acid Clinical Trial (FACT), a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, phase III trial designed to assess the efficacy of high-dose FA in preventing preeclampsia.

- **Methods**: For FACT, women were randomized at 8–16 gestational weeks to receive daily 4.0 mg FA (high dose) or placebo (low dose) plus their usual supplementation (≤ 1.1 mg). Women were recruited from three Canadian FACT centers and provided nonfasting blood samples at 24–26 gestational weeks for measurement of RBC and serum total folate, serum unmetabolized FA (UMFA), tetrahydrofolate (THF), 5-methylTHF, 5-formylTHF, 5,10-methenylTHF, and MeFox (pyrazino-s-triazine derivative of 4α-hydroxy-5-methylTHF, a 5-methylTHF oxidation product); total vitamins B-12 and B-6; and plasma total homocysteine. Group differences were determined using χ2, Fisher exact, and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests.

- **Results**: Nineteen (38%) women received high-dose FA, and 31 (62%) received low-dose FA. The median RBC folate concentration was 2701 (IQR: 2243–3032) nmol/L and did not differ between groups. The high-dose group had higher serum total folate (median: 148.4 n.

### Physiological need for calcium, iron, and folic acid for women of various subpopulations during pregnancy and beyond [^112k3n7L]. Journal of Women's Health (2021). Low credibility.

Because of the high rate of unplanned pregnancy and the potential serious effects of folate deficiency, the Food and Drug Administration has mandated the fortification of such U.S. grain products as pasta, rice, and cereals since January 1998 and of corn masa flour since April 2016.

Estimating racial and ethnic differences in both folate and folic acid synthesis and the effects of fortification and supplementation on outcomes has been difficult. Supplementation with folic acid had less of an effect on maternal and cord blood sample folates for African Americans. A study of women living in Georgia found that approximately 25% of women were taking a folic acid supplement preconception, with non-Hispanic women twice as likely as Hispanic women to take folic acid supplements. In terms of differences in metabolism, among women taking folic acid supplements, the largest increase in folate levels was noted in White women, followed by Hispanic women, with Black women experiencing the lowest serum folate levels.

Underlying conditions also affect folate levels and risk for neural tube defects (NTDs). Hispanic women are more likely than other groups to have the MTHFR C677T gene variant, which can result in impaired folic acid processing. People with alcohol use disorder, inflammatory bowel disease, celiac disease, gastric surgeries, and gastritis may be at risk for impaired folic acid absorption. Ethnic and racial variations in the prevalence of these conditions affect the physiology of folic acid.

When identifying the success and cost–benefit analysis of folic acid food enrichment, it is important to take cultural food practices into consideration.

### Unmetabolized folic acid and total folate concentrations in breast milk are unaffected by low-dose folate supplements [^113pXY7H]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2009). Low credibility.

Many lactating women in North America are exposed to high synthetic folic acid intakes because of food fortification and vitamin supplement use. Few data exist on the potential long-term effect of high folic acid intakes on milk folate concentrations, whereas no data are available on the effect of supplemental [6S]-5-methyltetrahydrofolate ([6S]-5-methylTHF).

- **Objective**: The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of 3 treatments (placebo, folic acid, and [6S]-5-methylTHF) on milk folate and folate-binding protein (FBP) concentrations and to determine whether unmetabolized folic acid is present in milk.

- **Design**: In this 16-week randomized, placebo-controlled intervention, 69 lactating women were randomly assigned to receive [6S]-5-methylTHF (416 micrograms/day, 906 nanomoles/day) or a placebo, or were assigned to receive folic acid (400 micrograms/day, 906 nanomoles/day) within one week postpartum. Total milk folate, FBP, and unmetabolized folic acid concentrations were measured at 16 weeks.

- **Results**: Unmetabolized folic acid was detected in 96% of milk samples tested, representing approximately 8% of total milk folate concentrations. Total milk folate, FBP, and the proportion of unmetabolized milk folic acid did not differ between treatments; however, FBP concentrations were significantly lower than those published before mandatory folic acid fortification of the food supply.

- **Conclusion**: Maternal intake of synthetic folic acid leads to the appearance of unmetabolized folic acid in milk and, seemingly, a down-regulation of milk FBP synthesis. The impact of these changes on the bioavailability of folate to infants requires further investigation.

### Will mandatory folic acid fortification prevent or promote cancer [^1153JoBA]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2004). Low credibility.

An overwhelming body of evidence for a protective effect of periconceptional folic acid supplementation against neural tube defects (NTDs) led to mandatory folic acid fortification in the United States. The effectiveness of folic acid fortification in improving folate status has already been shown to be quite striking, with a dramatic increase in blood measurements of folate in the United States. Preliminary reports suggest a significant reduction (approximately 15–50%) in NTDs in the United States.

The success of folic acid fortification in improving folate status and reducing NTD rates is truly a public health triumph and provides a paradigm of collaboration between science and public health policy. Although folic acid is generally regarded as safe, there continues to be concern that folic acid fortification may have adverse effects in subpopulation groups not originally targeted for fortification. In this regard, an emerging body of evidence suggests that folic acid supplementation may enhance the development and progression of already existing, undiagnosed premalignant and malignant lesions.

Over the past few years, the US population has been exposed to a significant increase in folate intake, for which essentially no data on safety exist. The potential cancer-promoting effect of folic acid supplementation needs to be considered in carefully monitoring the long-term effect of folic acid fortification on the vast majority of the US population, who are not at risk of NTDs.

### Periconceptional intake of folic acid among low-risk women in Canada: Summary of a workshop aiming to align prenatal folic acid supplement composition with current expert guidelines [^114rY8op]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2018). High credibility.

After the formal presentations, the 38 workshop participants were assigned to one of five working groups. Equal representation in each group from stakeholder groups, including academia, industry, government, and professional associations, was ensured by random assignment before the workshop. To encourage open and frank discussion, participants were advised that although they would be identified as workshop participants, no statement would be attributed to any individual or organization in the workshop proceedings.

The working groups first convened to identify challenges in aligning folic acid (FA) intake for women of childbearing age with recommendations aimed at reducing neural tube defect (NTD)-affected pregnancies in low-risk women. Once these challenges were shared with the larger group and summarized into statements, participants were asked to individually prioritize what they thought were the five most important challenges by placing a sticker on up to five of the summary statements posted around the room.

The smaller working groups were then asked to reconvene to develop potential solutions to the top five challenges, which were subsequently shared with the larger group. The last session consisted of a full group discussion focusing on the prioritization of the solutions. The top five challenges and the proposed solutions are detailed in Table 3.

### Folic acid: A public-health challenge [^112AmqqQ]. Lancet (2006). Low credibility.

Despite worldwide public health campaigns recommending periconceptional daily supplementation of synthetic folic acid to reduce the risk of neural tube defects, many women are not following these recommendations. At the same time, in most European countries, no decline in defects has been recorded in recent years. Vulnerable groups include those with a low standard of education, young people, and women with unplanned pregnancies.

Furthermore, in most countries without mandatory fortification, the general population is not consuming the recommended 0.4 mg of food folate per day. Voluntary fortification improves the situation but does not reach all parts of the population. In the United States, Canada, and Chile, mandatory fortification of flour substantially improved folate and homocysteine status, and neural tube defect rates fell by between 31% and 78%.

Nevertheless, many countries do not choose mandatory folic acid fortification, partly because expected additional health benefits are not yet scientifically proven in clinical trials, partly because of feared health risks, and due to the issue of freedom of choice. Thus, additional creative public health approaches need to be developed to prevent neural tube defects and improve the folate status of the general population.

### MTHFR 677C→T genotype is associated with folate and homocysteine concentrations in a large, population-based, double-blind trial of folic acid supplementation [^114nVspg]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2011). Low credibility.

The methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) genotype is associated with modification of disease and risk of neural tube defects. Plasma and red blood cell (RBC) folate and plasma homocysteine concentrations change in response to daily intakes of folic acid supplements, but no large-scale or population-based randomized trials have examined whether the MTHFR genotype modifies the observed response.

- **Objective**: We sought to determine whether the MTHFR 677C→T genotype modifies the response to folic acid supplementation during and three months after discontinuation of supplementation.

- **Design**: Northern Chinese women of childbearing age were enrolled in a six-month supplementation trial of different folic acid doses: 100, 400, and 4000 μg/d and 4000 μg/wk. Plasma and RBC folate and plasma homocysteine concentrations were measured at baseline; after one, three, and six months of supplementation; and three months after discontinuation of supplementation. MTHFR genotyping was performed to identify a C→T mutation at position 677 (n = 932).

- **Results**: Plasma and RBC folate and homocysteine concentrations were associated with MTHFR genotype throughout the supplementation trial, regardless of folic acid dose. MTHFR TT was associated with lower folate concentrations, and the trend of TT < CC was maintained at even the highest doses. Folic acid doses of 100 μg/d or 4000 μg/wk did not reduce high homocysteine concentrations in those with the MTHFR TT genotype.

- **Conclusion**: MTHFR genotype was an independent predictor of plasma and RBC folate and plasma homocysteine concentrations and did not have a significant impact.

### Periconceptional intake of folic acid among low-risk women in Canada: Summary of a workshop aiming to align prenatal folic acid supplement composition with current expert guidelines [^115MFV7X]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2018). High credibility.

Although evidence is lacking to confirm a potential dose-dependent adverse effect of folic acid (FA) when supplemented across all trimesters, the "precautionary principle" could be considered in the re-evaluation or confirmation of periconceptional supplementation guidelines. The precautionary principle originated in environmental science and aims to anticipate, monitor, and prevent unintended adverse consequences of public health interventions.

In the context of prenatal supplementation guidelines, the precautionary principle can be defined as a guide for decision-making in the public health context and a policy tool for acknowledging scientific uncertainty by prompting a preventive intervention, calling for more research, or both, in light of the existing state of the evidence.

### Do racial and ethnic differences in serum folate values exist after food fortification with folic acid [^113yGnRQ]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2006). Low credibility.

The United States food supply has been fortified with folic acid since 1998. Information about folate levels early in pregnancy before the fortification is limited. This study examined the associations between serum folate at the first prenatal visit and maternal race/ethnicity, age, vitamin use, and body mass index.

- **Study design**: This cross-sectional study assessed serum folate levels among 9,421 women who entered prenatal care in 1999 and 2000 in southern California. Information on race/ethnicity, vitamin use, weight, height, and age was obtained from surveys and birth certificates.

- **Results**: After adjustment for vitamin use, the strongest predictor of serum folate level, being in the lowest folate quartile (≤ 16 ng/mL) was related independently to being of Black, Hispanic, or Asian/Pacific Islander race/ethnicity, being of younger age, and being overweight or obese.

- **Conclusion**: After food fortification with folic acid, differences in serum folate values in pregnant women by maternal race/ethnicity, age, and body mass index persisted.

### Modeling the impact of folic acid fortification and supplementation on red blood cell folate concentrations and predicted neural tube defect risk in the United States: Have we reached optimal prevention [^113WHLww]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2018). High credibility.

The US CDC and the Institute of Medicine recommend that women capable of becoming pregnant consume ≥ 400 µg synthetic folic acid per day to prevent neural tube defects (NTDs). The United States has three sources of folic acid: fortified enriched cereal grain products (ECGPs), fortified ready-to-eat (RTE) cereals, and dietary supplements.

- **Objective**: Our objectives were as follows: 1) to estimate the usual daily folic acid intake and distributions of red blood cell (RBC) folate concentrations among women consuming folic acid from different sources; 2) to assess the usual daily total folic acid intake associated with optimal RBC folate concentrations for NTD prevention; 3) to predict NTD prevalence; and 4) to estimate the number of preventable folate-sensitive NTDs.

- **Design**: NHANES data (2007–2012) for nonpregnant women of reproductive age (12–49 years) were used to estimate usual daily intakes of synthetic folic acid and natural food folate. We applied existing models of the relation between RBC folate concentrations and NTD risk to predict NTD prevalence.

- **Results**: Based on the distribution of overall RBC folate concentrations (4,783 women), the predicted NTD prevalence was 7.3 per 10,000 live births [95% uncertainty interval (UI): 5.5–9.4 per 10,000 live births]. Women consuming folic acid from ECGPs as their only source had lower usual daily total folic acid intakes (median: 115 µg/day; IQR: 79–156 µg/day), lower RBC folate concentrations (median: 881 nmol/L; IQR: 704–1108 nmol/L), and higher predicted NTD prevalence (8.5 per 10,000 live births; 95% UI: 6.4–10.8 per 10,000 live births).

### Folic acid supplementation and the risk of cardiovascular diseases: A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^113oUzcZ]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). High credibility.

Subgroup analyses revealed more pronounced intervention effects among populations with lower baseline folate levels (baseline folate < 16 nmol/L in 9 RCTs: RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.83–0.97, P < 0.0001; baseline folate ≥ 16 nmol/L in 6 RCTs: RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.95–1.07, P = 0.78; P = 0.016 for interaction). A larger magnitude of homocysteine reduction was associated with a greater reduction in the risk of CVD (change in homocysteine by 4 μmol/L in 10 RCTs: RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.96–1.06, P = 0.67; by 4 to < 5 μmol/L in 3 RCTs: RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.85–1.01, P = 0.08; by ≥ 5 μmol/L in 5 RCTs: RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.71–0.94, P = 0.005; P = 0.009 for interaction). There was no significant difference in the intervention effect for other subgroups; however, the benefits of folic acid supplementation for stroke and CVD appear to be stronger in Asian populations than in European or North American populations. We did not observe a significant difference of intervention effect according to the dosage of folic acid supplementation. We also examined the intervention effect stratified by average baseline age of participants and duration of follow-up but did not observe a clear pattern of intervention effect on CVD in the joint categories of these two variables (P = 0.22 for interaction).

### Folic acid supplementation and the risk of cardiovascular diseases: A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^114TgdkF]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

In this meta-analysis, we found a modest benefit of a 10% reduced risk of stroke with folic acid supplementation compared with the control group. Folic acid supplementation also showed a small but significant benefit of a 4% less risk of overall cardiovascular disease (CVD) events, with significant heterogeneity according to baseline folate levels, preexisting diseases, or the extent of homocysteine reduction. No significant benefit or harm of folic acid supplementation on the risk of incident coronary heart disease (CHD) was found.

- **Comparison with other meta-analyses or reviews**: Compared with the most recent systematic reviews of folic acid supplementation and CVD risk, we included three new trials published during the 2013–2015 period and conducted in four countries with 22,510 more participants. Consequently, our comprehensive meta-analysis summarized the most up-to-date evidence. Different from previous meta-analyses, we included all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of folic acid supplementation and CVD without restrictions on the study sample size, treatment period, or preexisting disease status. However, we conducted stratified analyses to fully consider the impact of these factors on the intervention effect.

Folic acid supplementation significantly reduced the risk of stroke by 18% in a meta-analysis conducted in 2007, which was based on eight RCTs with at least 10 stroke cases in each group and at least six months of follow-up. With more RCTs published, 10 more meta-analyses of folic acid supplementation and the risk of stroke were published with different inclusion criteria.

### Initiation and duration of folic acid supplementation in preventing congenital malformations [^117EPgT3]. BMC Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Pre- and post-conception folic acid (FA) supplementation has been studied to understand its impact on congenital malformations. Compared to women without FA supplementation, those who began FA after becoming pregnant had a lower risk of congenital malformations. This association was marginally statistically significant in the sensitive analyses.

Further analyses revealed that among women who initiated FA after pregnancy, starting the supplementation in the first month of gestation (OR: 0.55; 95% CI: 0.33–0.91) and maintaining a moderate duration of 1.01–2 months (OR: 0.59; 95% CI: 0.36–0.98) resulted in a reduced risk of congenital malformations compared to women without supplementation.

Preconceptional initiation of FA, including among subgroups of women who began supplementation more than or less than three months before pregnancy, was not significantly associated with congenital malformations.

### Biomarker responses to folic acid intervention in healthy adults: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^115px56A]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2014). High credibility.

The task of revising dietary folate recommendations for optimal health is complicated by a lack of data quantifying the biomarker response that reliably reflects a given folate intake. We conducted a dose-response meta-analysis in healthy adults to quantify the typical response of recognized folate biomarkers to a change in folic acid intake.

Electronic and bibliographic searches identified 19 randomized controlled trials that supplemented with folic acid and measured folate biomarkers before and after the intervention in apparently healthy adults aged ≥ 18 years. For each biomarker response, the regression coefficient (β) for individual studies and the overall pooled β were calculated using random-effects meta-analysis.

Folate biomarkers (serum/plasma and red blood cell folate) increased in response to folic acid in a dose-response manner only up to an intake of 400 μg/day. Calculation of the overall pooled β for studies in the range of 50 to 400 μg/day indicated that a doubling of folic acid intake resulted in an increase in serum/plasma folate by 63% (71% for microbiological assay; 61% for nonmicrobiological assay) and red blood cell folate by 31% (irrespective of whether a microbiological or other assay was used). Studies that used the microbiological assay indicated lower heterogeneity compared with studies using nonmicrobiological assays for determining serum/plasma (I² = 13.5% compared with I² = 77.2%) and red blood cell (I² = 45.9% compared with I² = 70.2%) folate.

### Folic acid handling by the human gut: Implications for food fortification and supplementation [^112DozGv]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2014). Low credibility.

Concerns have been mounting about the safety of a persistent exposure to folic acid that results in the circulation of unmetabolized folic acid, including the potential for masking vitamin B-12 deficiency and the acceleration of cognitive decline in the elderly with a low vitamin B-12 status. An increase in the incidence of prostate and other cancers was seen in studies performed to address the hypothesis that folic acid supplementation reduces cancer risk, and an increase in overall mortality was seen in patients who were taking folic acid supplements.

A paradox exists in that dietary folate is beneficial, but supplemental folic acid may have some detrimental effects. Both dietary folates and folic acid are taken up by mucosal cells with a similar affinity by the proton-coupled folate transporter. The absorptive mucosa rearranges 5-formyltetrahydrofolic acid (5-FormylTHF) to 5-methyltetrahydrofolic acid (5-MTHF) before transport to the serosal side and transports 5-MTHF unchanged. The generally accepted wisdom, derived from rodent studies, is that physiologic doses of folic acid are biotransformed in the intestinal absorptive mucosa and transferred to the hepatic portal vein as 5-MTHF in the same way as dietary folates. That this process may also be applicable to humans may have been a misreading of an article that concluded "under physiological conditions only 5-MTHF reaches the blood". However, the article referred to a study where only a small percentage of ingested folate was folic acid. This apparent consensus was challenged by studies that showed…

### Practice bulletin no. 187: Neural tube defects [^11118rKA]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). High credibility.

The ACOG 2017 guidelines highlight the importance of addressing folate deficiency, particularly in pregnant patients. They recommend offering folic acid supplementation of 400 mcg/day, starting at least one month before pregnancy and continuing through the first 12 weeks of pregnancy. This guidance applies to all women who are planning a pregnancy or are capable of becoming pregnant.

### Quantifying the effect of folic acid [^116ey7BZ]. Lancet (2001). Low credibility.

Folic acid is known to prevent neural-tube defects (NTDs), but the size of the effect for a given dose is unclear. We aimed to quantify such an effect.

- **Methods**: We used published data from 13 studies of folic acid supplementation on serum folate concentrations and results from a large cohort study of the risk of NTDs according to serum folate, to measure the preventive effect of specified increases in intake of folic acid.

- **Findings**: Serum folate concentrations increase by 0.94 ng/mL (95% CI 0.77–1.10) for every 0.1 mg/day increase in folic acid intake in women aged 20–35 years, and about double that in people aged 40–65. Every doubling of serum folate concentration roughly halves the risk of an NTD. These two effects can be combined to predict the reduction in risk according to intake of extra folic acid and background serum folate concentration. Such results predict that the preventive effect is greater in women with low serum folate than in those with higher concentrations. The results have also been used to predict direct observations from large randomized trials and the effect of food fortification. From a typical western background serum folate of 5 ng/mL, about 0.2 mg/day (the US level of folic acid fortification) would be expected to reduce NTDs by about 20%; a similar effect can be expected from the British recommendation (0.24 mg/day). An increase of 0.4 mg/day would reduce risk by about 36%, of 1 mg/day by 57%, and taking a 5-mg tablet daily would reduce risk by about 85%.

- **Interpretation**: Folic acid fortification levels should be increased.

### Folic acid supplementation during the preconception period: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^116QLeWs]. Preventive Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Guidelines recommend that women take folic acid supplements during the preconception period to prevent neural tube defects (NTDs) in their offspring. However, estimates of adherence to this recommendation across different countries have not been synthesized.

Medline, CINAHL, and EMBASE were systematically searched to identify studies reporting the prevalence of preconception folic acid supplementation. Pooled prevalence estimates for each country, where data were available, were calculated, and differences based on demographic, methodological, and study quality characteristics were examined.

Of 3,372 titles and abstracts screened, 722 full-texts were reviewed, and 105 articles that reported 106 estimates of preconception folic acid supplementation in 34 countries were included. Pooled prevalence estimates were as follows: 32–51% in North America, 9–78% in Europe, 21–46% in Asia, 4–34% in the Middle East, 32–39% in Australia/New Zealand, and 0% in Africa. No South American studies were identified.

Higher supplementation prevalence was observed in studies with more highly educated samples, those conducted in fertility clinics, and those that assessed folic acid use via self-report. Notably, only 32% of studies reported the timing of folic acid use, and only 28% reported adherence to folic acid.

Preconception folic acid supplementation is highly variable worldwide, and many women may not achieve sufficient folate levels to prevent NTDs. To better understand non-adherence, recommendations for future research include more explicit reporting of methodology and a more detailed assessment of folic acid use.

### Meta-analysis of folic acid efficacy trials in stroke prevention: Insight into effect modifiers [^116X7zRg]. Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

To examine the efficacy and effect modifiers of folic acid supplementation in the prevention of stroke in regions without folic acid fortification, a meta-analysis was conducted based on relevant, up-to-date published randomized trials.

- **Methods**: Relative risk (RR) was used to measure the effect of folic acid supplementation on the risk of stroke using a fixed effects model.

- **Findings**: Overall, folic acid supplementation significantly reduced stroke risk by 11% (22 trials, n = 82,723; RR 0.89, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.84–0.96). The effect was greater in low folate regions (2 trials, n = 24,020; Asia, RR 0.78, CI 0.67–0.90) compared to high folate regions (7 trials, n = 14,655; America, RR 1.05, CI 0.90–1.23), and among patients without folic acid fortification (11 trials, n = 49,957; RR 0.85, CI 0.77–0.94) compared with those with folic acid fortification (7 trials, n = 14,655; RR 1.05, CI 0.90–1.23). In further stratified analyses among trials without folic acid fortification, a larger beneficial effect was found in those trials that used a low dosage of folic acid (≤ 0.8 mg: RR 0.78, CI 0.69–0.88) or low baseline vitamin B12 levels (< 384 pg/mL: RR 0.78, CI 0.68–0.89). In the corresponding comparison groups, the effect sizes were attenuated and insignificant (p for interaction < 0.05 for both). Although the interaction tests were not significant, there might be a higher benefit in trials with low dosage of vitamin B12, low prevalence of statin use, but a high prevalence of hypertension.

- **Conclusions**: Folic acid supplementation could reduce the stroke risk in regions without folic acid fortification, particularly in areas where these specific conditions exist.

### Effect of prenatal multiple micronutrient supplementation compared with iron and folic acid supplementation on size at birth and subsequent growth through 24 mo of age: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113Y1M95]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2025). High credibility.

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of trials that assessed the effect of daily prenatal multiple micronutrient supplementation (MMS) compared to iron and folic acid (IFA) on an infant's size at birth and/or anthropometric outcomes up to 24 months of age. The review protocol was preregistered at PROSPERO (registration number CRD42024551864) on July 6, 2024.

- **Literature searches**: We included the trials from Keats et al, a 2019 Cochrane review that informed the 2020 WHO guideline on MMS, as well as newly published trials identified through the same search criteria and meeting the same inclusion criteria. Of the 19 trials included in the Cochrane review, which were conducted in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) and compared MMS with iron, with and without folic acid, one provided MMS twice weekly and was excluded from the systematic review assessing the impact of daily supplementation.

Given our initial focus on the 18 trials included in the Cochrane review published in 2019, there was a need to identify new trials and follow-up studies of the 18 included trials that conducted anthropometric assessments of the offspring up to 2 years of age. This was done in three steps. First, we conducted systematic literature searches in three electronic databases (MEDLINE [Ovid], Embase [Ovid], and Scopus) on July 2, 2024, without applying language restrictions, to identify new trials published since 2018 (the date of the literature searches for the Cochrane review). The search strategy employed in Embase (Ovid) is presented in the Supplemental Appendix. Second, we conducted searches in MEDLINE (Ovid) using the trial identification number of each of the 18 trials.

### Guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of cobalamin and folate disorders [^113bpSGh]. British Journal of Haematology (2014). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for folate deficiency, more specifically with respect to RBC folate, BSH 2014 guidelines recommend avoiding routine testing of RBC folate, as serum folate alone is sufficient in most cases.

### Weekly iron-folic acid supplements containing 2.8 mg folic acid are associated with a lower risk of neural tube defects than the current practice of 0.4 mg: A randomised controlled trial in Malaysia [^116bXGgd]. BMJ Global Health (2020). High credibility.

A sample size of 63 participants per treatment group was required to detect a clinically meaningful difference of 100 nmol/L in mean RBC folate concentrations across groups at the end of the intervention period (16 weeks), while adjusting for baseline RBC folate concentration, with 80% power and two-sided α of 0.0167 for pairwise comparisons between the three treatment groups (overall α = 0.05). The sample size assumes an SD of 202 nmol/L, a correlation between RBC folate concentrations at baseline and 16 weeks of 0.6, and a drop-out rate of up to 10%. We aimed to recruit 100 participants per group to allow for some uncertainty in the assumed values.

A descriptive comparison of the randomised groups was conducted on all baseline demographic characteristics and baseline measures of the outcomes. The primary analysis was performed on the available data according to treatment allocation at randomisation (intention-to-treat analysis). A secondary 'per-protocol' analysis was also performed, including only women who completed the study and were more than 80% adherent to the treatment regime. Continuous outcomes were analysed using linear regression models, and binary outcomes were analysed using log-binomial regression models, or log Poisson regression models with robust variance estimation if convergence issues occurred. Adjustment was also made for baseline body mass index (BMI) category in an unplanned sensitivity analysis after observing a chance imbalance in BMI between the treatment groups. Treatment group, time point (16 or 20 weeks), and a treatment group by time point interaction term were considered in the analysis.

### Association between adherence to folic acid supplements and serum folate, and plasma homocysteine among hemodialysis patients [^113ixdUv]. Journal of Renal Nutrition (2011). Low credibility.

To examine the relationship between adherence to prescribed folic acid supplements and folic acid intake, serum folate, and plasma homocysteine in hemodialysis patients, the effects of change in adherence patterns from enrollment to 1 year later on changes in these same measures were also assessed.

Secondary data analysis was conducted with eighty-six hemodialysis patients who participated in the Hemodialysis (HEMO) Study's Homocysteine ancillary study. The main outcome measures were folic acid supplement intake, serum folate, and plasma homocysteine.

Eighty-eight percent of patients at enrollment and 91% 1 year later were adherent to prescribed folic acid supplements. Non-adherers had lower intakes of folic acid at both enrollment and 1 year later and lower serum folate levels at enrollment. Percent change was significantly different between the three adherence change groups for folic acid intake (P = 0.001) and plasma homocysteine (P < .001) from enrollment to 1 year later. The non-adherent group at enrollment had the lowest intakes and serum folate levels, and the highest plasma homocysteine levels. When they became adherent 1 year later, they had the greatest change in folic acid intake (5,461%; p = 0.03), coupled with a 69% increase in serum folate (P = 0.04) and a 29% decrease in plasma homocysteine (P = 0.03).

In conclusion, hemodialysis patients who were non-adherent to folic acid supplement prescriptions had low folic acid intakes, low serum folate, and high homocysteine levels. When their adherence improved, folic acid intakes rose, and serum folates increased.

### Folate dietary insufficiency and folic acid supplementation similarly impair metabolism and compromise hematopoiesis [^113661Le]. Haematologica (2017). Low credibility.

While dietary folate deficiency is associated with an increased risk for birth defects and other diseases, evidence suggests that supplementation with folic acid can contribute to a predisposition to some diseases, including immune dysfunction and cancer. Herein, we show that diets supplemented with folic acid, both below and above the recommended levels, led to significantly altered metabolism in multiple tissues in mice.

Surprisingly, both low and excessive dietary folate induced similar metabolic changes, which were particularly evident for nucleotide biosynthetic pathways in B-progenitor cells. Diet-induced metabolic changes in these cells partially phenocopied those observed in mice treated with anti-folate drugs, suggesting that both deficiency and excessive levels of dietary folic acid compromise folate-dependent biosynthetic pathways.

Both folate deficiency and excessive dietary folate levels compromise hematopoiesis, resulting in defective cell cycle progression, persistent DNA damage, and impaired production of lymphocytes. These defects reduce the reconstitution potential in transplantation settings and increase radiation-induced mortality. We conclude that excessive folic acid supplementation can metabolically mimic dietary folate insufficiency, leading to similar functional impairment of hematopoiesis.

### Folate dietary insufficiency and folic acid supplementation similarly impair metabolism and compromise hematopoiesis [^111tqQZc]. Haematologica (2017). Low credibility.

Data presented herein demonstrate that both low and high levels of dietary folate compromise metabolism in multiple organs, with significant defects manifesting in the B-progenitor compartment. Although folate is required in multiple biosynthetic pathways, including for nucleotides, glutathione, SAM, and amino acids, we primarily observed deficiencies in the nucleotide synthesis pathways for B-progenitors isolated from mice fed FD and SD diets, as demonstrated using both NMR and UHPLC-mass spectrometry. The impact of the FD and SD diets on reduced nucleotide synthesis in B-progenitor cells likely contributed to the S-phase proliferative defects observed using EdU analysis.

The observation that both low and high levels of dietary folate promote similar metabolic defects in hematopoietic cells is surprising. Nonetheless, based on mathematical modeling, Ulrich and colleagues have suggested that adverse effects of high folate diets might be explained by the ability of key enzymes in the purine and pyrimidine synthetic pathways to be inhibited by products of folate metabolism. For example, thymidylate synthase (TS) uses methylene-tetrahydrofolate (MTHF) to make dTMP from deoxyuridine monophosphate (dUMP), producing dihydrofolate (DHF), which must be recycled by DHFR to regenerate tetrahydrofuran (THF). Importantly, DHF can inhibit TS activity. Notably, supplemented folic acid requires reduction by DHFR, mostly in the liver, to DHF; however, this reaction is more than 1000 times slower relative to the reduction of DHF to THF, and DHFR exhibits variable activity in the livers.

### Periconceptional intake of folic acid among low-risk women in Canada: Summary of a workshop aiming to align prenatal folic acid supplement composition with current expert guidelines [^116DrzF4]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2018). Low credibility.

Folate is a generic descriptor for a family of compounds sharing a pteroylglutamic acid core, and its primary biological role is the transfer of 1-carbon units. Pteroylglutamic acid, or folic acid (FA), is the most common form of folate used in dietary supplements and as a fortificant in foods; it is completely oxidized, stable, highly bioavailable, and seldom found in nature. In contrast, naturally occurring folates are more labile, less bioavailable, typically reduced (e.g. dihydro- or tetrahydrofolate), and frequently carry a carbon group (e.g. methyl, formyl). A significant fraction of naturally occurring folates have a polyglutamate tail, which is necessary for cellular retention and affinity to various enzymes in living cells. Folate monoglutamates, but not polyglutamates, are transported across cells.

Excellent sources of naturally occurring folate include green leafy vegetables, dark green vegetables (e.g. broccoli and Brussels sprouts), and legumes (e.g. beans, chickpeas, lentils). Folate is best known for its role as a cofactor in nucleotide synthesis — necessary for DNA and RNA biosynthesis and repair — and for the remethylation of homocysteine to produce the essential amino acid methionine. Methionine is used for protein synthesis or can be converted to S-adenosylmethionine. S-adenosylmethionine is involved in numerous methylation reactions in the body, including that of DNA and histones, which are required for epigenetic programming early in life.

Adverse effects potentially associated with high FA intake

The Institute of Medicine set the UL for FA at 1000 μg/d, based on case reports in the 1940s of precipitation or exacerbation of neurologic damage in vitamin B-12–deficient individuals. The UL was intended to be the usual intake level of FA at which no one would exceed the Lowest Observed Adverse Effect Level of 5000 μg.

More recently, concerns have been raised that "high" intakes of FA may have other potential adverse health consequences in addition to those related to vitamin B-12 and the UL. Systematic review of this literature is difficult due to inconsistent application of the term "high" FA intake and/or status. Some potential adverse effects associated with supplemental FA intake explored in the literature include impaired fetal growth, promotion of cancer, an aggravating interaction with vitamin B-12 deficiency, and increased risk of childhood diseases such as asthma and autism. Although there exists a body of literature discussing FA and cancer, the US National Toxicology Program and the UK Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition did not identify conclusive evidence on adverse effects of FA in cancer as recently reviewed. In the context of this workshop, however, we focused specifically on pregnancy-associated outcomes.

Studies of pregnancy- and child-related outcomes associated with prenatal supplemental FA intake for different periods in pregnancy have been summarized in Table 2. Meta-analyses and systematic reviews reported beneficial effects of periconceptional FA supplementation.

### Knowledge gaps in understanding the metabolic and clinical effects of excess folates/folic acid: a summary, and perspectives, from an NIH workshop [^113rku9w]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2020). Low credibility.

Folate, an essential nutrient found naturally in foods in a reduced form, is present in dietary supplements and fortified foods in an oxidized synthetic form (folic acid). Maintaining adequate folate status is critical to prevent diseases due to folate inadequacy, such as anemia, birth defects, and cancer. However, there are concerns about potential adverse effects of excess folic acid intake and/or elevated folate status. The original concern focused on the exacerbation of clinical effects of vitamin B-12 deficiency and its role in neurocognitive health.

More recently, animal and observational studies have suggested potential adverse effects on cancer risk, birth outcomes, and other diseases. Observations indicating adverse effects from excess folic acid intake, elevated folate status, and unmetabolized folic acid (UMFA) remain inconclusive; the data do not provide the evidence needed to affect public health recommendations. Moreover, strong biological and mechanistic premises connecting elevated folic acid intake, UMFA, and/or high folate status to adverse health outcomes are lacking.

However, the body of evidence on potential adverse health outcomes indicates the need for comprehensive research to clarify these issues and bridge knowledge gaps. Three key research questions encompass the additional research needed to establish whether high folic acid or total folate intake contributes to disease risk:

- **UMFA and health effects**: Does UMFA affect biological pathways leading to adverse health effects?
- **Elevated folate status and disease risk**: Does elevated folate status resulting from any form of folate intake contribute to disease risk?

### Micronutrient supplementation and pregnancy outcomes: double-blind randomized controlled trial in China [^113H9c86]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Beyond perinatal folic acid supplementation, the need for additional prenatal prophylaxis of iron with or without other micronutrients remains unclear. We aim to investigate the maternal and infant health effects of iron plus folic acid and multiple micronutrient supplements versus folic acid alone when provided to pregnant women with no or mild anemia.

- **Methods**: In this randomized double-blind controlled trial, 18,775 nulliparous pregnant women with mild or no anemia were enrolled from five counties of northern China from May 2006 through April 2009. Women were randomly assigned to daily folic acid (400 μg) (control), folic acid-iron (30 mg), or folic acid, iron, and 13 additional vitamins and minerals provided before 20 weeks of gestation until delivery. The primary outcome was perinatal mortality. Secondary outcomes included neonatal and infant mortality, preterm delivery, birth weight, birth length, gestational duration, and maternal hemoglobin concentration and anemia.

- **Results**: A total of 92.7% of women consumed 80% to 100% of supplements as instructed. On average, women consumed 177 supplements. Compared with daily prenatal folic acid, supplementation with iron-folic acid with or without other micronutrients did not affect the rate of perinatal mortality (8.8, 8.7, and 8.3 per 1000 births, respectively). Relative risks (RRs) were 1.00 (95% CI, 0.68–1.46; p = 0.99) and 0.94 (95% CI, 0.64–1.39; p = 0.76), respectively. The risk of other adverse maternal and infant outcomes also did not differ, except that RRs for third-trimester maternal anemia were 0.72 (95% CI, 0.63–0.83; P…

### Periconceptional intake of folic acid among low-risk women in Canada: Summary of a workshop aiming to align prenatal folic acid supplement composition with current expert guidelines [^111yNBQX]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2018). Low credibility.

The folate status of Canadians, including women of reproductive age, has dramatically shifted over the past 50 years. The 1970–1972 Nutrition Canada Survey reported on the nutritional status of 12,795 Canadians from all 10 provinces. At that time, 50% of Canadian women of reproductive age had serum folate concentrations that were indicative of either moderate (< 12 nmol/L) or high risk (< 5 nmol/L) of classical folate deficiency. A number of subsequent provincial surveys and local reports examining the folate status of women of reproductive age over the next three decades confirmed these biochemical findings and suggested that most women had intakes below recommendations.

In 1998, the Canadian government mandated that all white-wheat flour and enriched pasta contain 150 μg folic acid (FA) per 100 g of flour, and up to a maximum amount of 270 μg FA per 100 g of pasta, to increase the folate intakes of reproductive-aged women by 100 μg per day. Based on monitoring data of births and pregnancy terminations due to fetal anomalies from 7 of 10 Canadian provinces, mandatory fortification resulted in a 46% reduction in the prevalence of neural tube defects (NTDs), from a prefortification rate of 1.58 per 1000 births to a rate of 0.86 per 1000 births postfortification.

The first nationally representative blood folate values after FA fortification of the food supply were available from the 2007–2009 Canadian Health Measures Survey. The data indicated that classical folate deficiency, as measured by an RBC folate concentration < 305 nmol, was virtually nonexistent. Among women of reproductive age, approximately 80% had RBC concentrations…

### Folate supplementation and twinning in patients with sickle cell disease [^111CDtVN]. American Journal of Hematology (2006). Low credibility.

Patients with sickle cell disease routinely take folic acid daily as a supplement to maintain effective erythropoiesis. One of the controversial effects of folic acid is its effect on twin gestation rates. In this report, we present our experience with patients who have sickle cell disease and twin pregnancies. Our data show that twin pregnancies seem to be associated with folate supplementation.

### Abnormal folate metabolism in foetuses affected by neural tube defects [^1116Efun]. Brain (2007). Low credibility.

Folic acid supplementation can prevent many cases of neural tube defects (NTDs), whereas suboptimal maternal folate status is a risk factor, suggesting that folate metabolism is a key determinant of susceptibility to NTDs. Despite extensive genetic analysis of folate cycle enzymes and quantification of metabolites in maternal blood, neither the protective mechanism nor the relationship between maternal folate status and susceptibility are understood in most cases.

In order to investigate potential abnormalities in folate metabolism in the embryo itself, we derived primary fibroblastic cell lines from foetuses affected by NTDs and subjected them to the dU suppression test, a sensitive metabolic test of folate metabolism. Significantly, a subset of NTD cases exhibited low scores in this test, indicative of abnormalities in folate cycling that may be causally linked to the defect. Susceptibility to NTDs may be increased by suppression of the methylation cycle, which is interlinked with the folate cycle. However, reduced efficacy in the dU suppression test was not associated with altered abundance of the methylation cycle intermediates s-adenosylmethionine and s-adenosylhomocysteine, suggesting that a methylation cycle defect is unlikely to be responsible for the observed abnormality of folate metabolism.

Genotyping of samples for known polymorphisms in genes encoding folate-associated enzymes did not reveal any correlation between specific genotypes and the observed abnormalities in folate metabolism. These data suggest that as yet unrecognized genetic variants result in embryonic development issues linked to folate metabolism abnormalities.

In humans, an exogenous source of folate is required for nucleoprotein synthesis and maintenance of normal erythropoiesis.

### Rethinking folic acid fortification: A call for nuanced strategies and broader investigations [^115PKCFC]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2025). Low credibility.

This comment letter responds to Edward H. Reynolds' comprehensive review on folate, vitamin B12, one‑carbon metabolism, and nervous system health. While commending the review's insights into the potential neurological harms of excess folic acid, especially with vitamin B12 deficiency, we expand on several critical areas. We emphasize distinguishing synthetic folic acid's neurotoxicity from natural folates, urging further comparative studies.

We highlight the underexplored long-term consequences of supraphysiological folic acid exposure in children and adolescents during critical neurodevelopment. The profound implications of transgenerational epigenetic effects from ancestral folate status are stressed, demanding urgent investigation in human cohorts. Crucially, we address the practical challenges of revising global fortification policies, noting the significant logistical, economic, and regulatory hurdles in shifting from folic acid to natural folate forms combined with vitamin B12.

We conclude by advocating for a nuanced, multi-pronged approach to fortification, urging reconsideration of the folic acid UL, enhanced population surveillance, and continued research to balance the benefits of neural tube defect prevention with potential harms of excess folate.

### Influence of reporting error on the relation between blood folate concentrations and reported folic acid-containing dietary supplement use among reproductive-aged women in the United States [^115AbGTf]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2003). Low credibility.

Folic acid intake is the most important predictor of blood folate concentrations among nonpregnant women, but the reporting of folic acid-containing supplement use is subject to error.

- **Objective**: We assessed the effect of reporting error of supplement use on blood folate concentrations.

- **Design**: Data from the third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey were analyzed. Respondents to that survey were asked twice about supplement use: during the household interview, to recall use in the previous month, and during the physical examination, to recall use in the previous 24 hours. To examine the effect of error reporting, we classified women (aged 15–44 years) into five groups according to supplement use in the previous month (nonusers, those ingesting ≥ 400 micrograms/day) and in the 24 hours before the physical examination (yes or no). We expected nonappreciable differences in red blood cell (RBC) folate concentration by status of 24-hour recall within the same category of previous-month use because RBC folate reflects long-term average consumption. We calculated covariate-adjusted means of serum and RBC folate concentrations.

- **Results**: Among women who reported average daily use of ≥ 400 micrograms folic acid in the previous month, the adjusted mean RBC folate was 436.5 nmol/L (95% CI: 406.7, 466.3 nmol/L) in those who did not take the supplement in the previous 24 hours and 519.7 nmol/L (95% CI: 496.2, 543.2 nmol/L) in those who did do so (P < 0.01). This significant difference indicates apparently erroneous reporting of supplement use.

### Parity and the use of folic acid supplementation during pregnancy [^1151TELf]. BMJ Nutrition, Prevention & Health (2019). Low credibility.

**Conclusion**: Parity is negatively associated with adherence to folic acid (FA) supplementation. Further studies need to be carried out to develop interventions to increase adherence to FA supplementation, particularly in multiparous women.

### Folic acid supplementation and the risk of cardiovascular diseases: A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^116KepJd]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). High credibility.

Our findings, based on the most comprehensive and up-to-date evidence, provide support for a modest benefit of folic acid supplementation for the prevention of stroke. There was a 10% reduced risk of stroke and a 4% reduced risk of overall cardiovascular disease (CVD) with folic acid supplementation. A greater benefit for CVD was observed among participants without preexisting CVD or with lower plasma folate levels at baseline, and in studies with a larger decrease in homocysteine levels. We did not observe any significant benefit or harm with folic acid supplementation for the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD).

### Weekly iron-folic acid supplements containing 2.8 mg folic acid are associated with a lower risk of neural tube defects than the current practice of 0.4 mg: a randomised controlled trial in Malaysia [^117NtMEi]. BMJ Global Health (2020). High credibility.

While no studies have compared iron with different weekly folic acid doses on RBC folate, weekly dosing has been compared with daily supplementation in at least two trials. Unsurprisingly, daily dosing is more effective than weekly at increasing blood folate indices. Among New Zealand women (18–40 years), daily supplementation with 0.4 mg folic acid was more effective than 2.8 mg weekly at increasing RBC folate after 12 weeks (MD (95% CI) 411 (325 to 504) and 265 (192 to 345) nmol/L, respectively) compared with the 0 mg group. Nevertheless, the authors concluded that 2.8 mg folic acid weekly would still be expected to decrease NTD risk. Moreover, in the New Zealand study, over half of the women taking the weekly folic acid supplement achieved an RBC folate concentration associated with a low risk of NTD at week 12 compared with nearly three-quarters in the daily 0.4 mg group. Compared with their respective placebo groups, the MD in RBC folate among women receiving 2.8 mg folic acid weekly in the New Zealand study was not as great as the difference reported in our study (MD 265 vs. 355 nmol/L). The greater difference in mean RBC folate observed in our study may be due to the longer duration of our study compared with the New Zealand study (16 vs. 12 weeks), as baseline RBC folate concentrations were similar after calibrator adjustment.

### Determining bioavailability of food folates in a controlled intervention study [^112wmagr]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2004). Low credibility.

The concept of dietary folate equivalents (DFEs) in the United States recognizes the differences in bioavailability between natural food folates and the synthetic vitamin, folic acid. However, many published reports on folate bioavailability are problematic because of several confounding factors.

- **Objective**: We compared the bioavailability of food folates with that of folic acid under controlled conditions. To broadly represent the extent to which natural folates are conjugated in foods, we used two natural sources of folate, spinach (50% polyglutamyl folate) and yeast (100% polyglutamyl folate).

- **Design**: Ninety-six men were randomly assigned according to their screening plasma homocysteine (tHcy) concentration to one of four treatment groups for an intervention period of 30 days. Each subject received (daily under supervision) either a folate-depleted "carrier" meal or a drink plus: 1) placebo tablet, 2) 200 micrograms folic acid in a tablet, 3) 200 micrograms natural folate provided as spinach, or 4) 200 micrograms natural folate provided as yeast.

- **Results**: Among the subjects who completed the intervention, responses (increase in serum folate, lowering of tHcy) relative to those in the placebo group (n = 18) were significant in the folic acid group (n = 18) but not in the yeast folate (n = 19) or the spinach folate (n = 18) groups. Both natural sources of folate were significantly less bioavailable than folic acid. Overall estimations of folate bioavailability relative to that of folic acid were found to be between 30% (spinach) and 59% (yeast).
