## Question

Diurese someone with no urine output

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether we should "diurese" someone with no urine output and, if so, how to approach it safely and effectively. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "no urine output" means clinically and how to stage it. Then, I should verify the major etiologies that cause anuria and which of them are reversible. Next, I will review guideline positions on loop diuretics in anuria and whether there is any role for them. After that, I need to outline the immediate diagnostic and therapeutic steps, including when to consider renal replacement therapy. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, stepwise plan and state a clear bottom line with caveats for exceptions like post-obstructive diuresis, making sure I double-check each claim against the cited sources as I go.

> Let me first confirm the clinical definition. "No urine output" corresponds to anuria, which by KDIGO AKI criteria is essentially 0 mL/kg/hour for 12 hours, aligning with Stage 3 AKI severity and indicating the most severe functional compromise of kidney function, with high morbidity and mortality risk if not promptly addressed [^4d498821] [^37411a09] [^39fdb0ec].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about treatment before identifying causes. I need to check the major etiologies of anuria: prerenal hypoperfusion, intrinsic renal parenchymal injury, and postrenal obstruction. Importantly, obstruction is a reversible cause that mandates urgent recognition and decompression to prevent permanent kidney damage, so I should prioritize excluding obstruction early with bladder scanning and renal ultrasound when appropriate [^8fd1c3dc] [^282ee7e5].

> Next, I should review guideline positions on loop diuretics in anuria. KDIGO explicitly recommends against using diuretics to treat AKI except to manage volume overload, and notes that diuretics do not improve survival, reduce RRT need, or hasten renal recovery; moreover, furosemide and bumetanide carry formal contraindications in anuria, so routine "diuresis" with loop agents in anuria is inappropriate and potentially harmful [^55d8e23c] [^31fb88df] [^2ae1d8e0] [^5e9b3b0b].

> Wait, let me verify whether there is any exception where a loop diuretic might be tried despite anuria. Some clinicians consider a single high-dose loop diuretic challenge to distinguish true anuria from severe oliguria or to unmask less severe injury, but even then, evidence shows no improvement in hard outcomes and risks delaying definitive therapy; thus, if attempted at all, it should be a one-time diagnostic maneuver in a closely monitored setting rather than repeated dosing, and it does not replace addressing the underlying cause or preparing for RRT when indicated [^c66af6c4] [^3b930925].

> I will now examine the immediate diagnostic steps. I need to ensure I assess volume status, discontinue nephrotoxins, obtain electrolytes and acid–base studies, and urgently evaluate for obstruction with bladder scan and renal ultrasound. In parallel, I should stage AKI using creatinine and urine output criteria to guide escalation, recognizing that anuria for 12 hours meets Stage 3 AKI and should trigger nephrology involvement and RRT preparation if not rapidly reversible [^4d498821] [^37411a09] [^282ee7e5].

> Let me think about therapeutic priorities. First, correct prerenal factors with cautious isotonic crystalloid if truly intravascularly depleted, but I should double-check that I'm not over-resuscitating a euvolemic or overloaded patient, as fluid overload worsens outcomes in AKI. Second, relieve obstruction urgently if present. Third, treat life-threatening complications such as hyperkalemia and metabolic acidosis per guideline-directed protocols. Fourth, prepare for RRT when anuria persists beyond 12–24 hours without recovery or when indications emerge, noting that in septic shock with AKI, delayed rather than early RRT is favored when no urgent indications exist [^a16b9cb9] [^8dda75e0] [^c168f92b].

> But wait, what if the "no urine output" was actually a catheter problem or a misread? I should confirm true anuria by verifying catheter patency, ensuring accurate collection, and using 6–8 hour urine output blocks when catheters are not in place, because misclassification can lead to inappropriate interventions; ERBP emphasizes structured urine output monitoring and using ideal body weight to calculate thresholds in obesity or cachexia to avoid misdiagnosis [^dc8794f1] [^033bb469].

> I should double-check the bottom line. Routine "diuresis" with loop diuretics in a patient with no urine output is contraindicated and not supported by evidence; instead, I need to rapidly identify and reverse the cause, manage complications, and escalate to RRT when indicated, reserving any loop diuretic challenge, if at all, for a closely monitored diagnostic purpose rather than as therapy [^55d8e23c] [^31fb88df] [^2ae1d8e0].

> Exception noted, and I need to ensure I don't conflate entities. Post-obstructive diuresis is the opposite of anuria; it occurs after relief of obstruction and manifests as polyuria, not oliguria/anuria, and its management focuses on careful fluid and electrolyte replacement to match urine losses rather than inducing diuresis, so it is a distinct scenario and should not prompt loop diuretic use either [^eb1de6f3] [^dd99d240].

---

Do not attempt to "diurese" a patient with **no urine output** (anuria) using loop diuretics, as this is ineffective and contraindicated [^2ae1d8e0] [^31fb88df]. Anuria reflects **severe renal failure or obstruction** [^8fd1c3dc]; diuretics will not restore urine output and may cause harm. The priority is to **identify and treat the cause** (e.g. hypovolemia, obstruction, intrinsic renal failure) and prepare for urgent renal replacement therapy if indicated [^8dda75e0]. Diuretics are only considered if there is volume overload to manage, and even then, they are unlikely to work in anuria [^55d8e23c].

---

## Pathophysiology of anuria

Anuria is defined as **urine output less than 100 mL in 24 hours** and results from severe impairment of renal function or urinary flow. The causes are broadly categorized as prerenal, intrinsic renal, and postrenal:

- **Prerenal causes**: Hypovolemia, hypotension, heart failure, or vascular occlusion leading to inadequate renal perfusion [^8fd1c3dc].
- **Intrinsic renal causes**: Acute tubular necrosis, glomerulonephritis, or severe interstitial nephritis causing direct renal parenchymal damage [^notfound].
- **Postrenal causes**: Obstruction of the urinary tract due to stones, tumors, or strictures, leading to complete cessation of urine flow [^8fd1c3dc].

---

## Contraindications to diuretics in anuria

Loop diuretics such as furosemide and bumetanide are **contraindicated in anuria** [^2ae1d8e0] [^31fb88df]. The FDA explicitly states that these medications should not be used in patients with anuria due to the risk of severe electrolyte disturbances, volume depletion, and worsening renal function. Diuretics require functional nephrons to excrete sodium and water; in anuria, the kidneys have lost this capacity, rendering diuretics ineffective and potentially harmful [^c66af6c4].

---

## Risks associated with diuretic use in anuria

Administering diuretics to an anuric patient can lead to **significant complications**, including:

- **Electrolyte disturbances**: Hypokalemia, hyponatremia, and metabolic alkalosis due to excessive renal losses.
- **Volume depletion**: Worsening hypotension and organ hypoperfusion.
- **Worsening renal function**: Further renal injury due to hypoperfusion and electrolyte imbalances.
- **Delayed definitive therapy**: Diuretics may mask the underlying cause of anuria, delaying necessary interventions such as renal replacement therapy or surgical relief of obstruction [^8fd1c3dc].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

Current clinical guidelines consistently advise against using diuretics in anuria. The **KDIGO guidelines** recommend that diuretics not be used to treat acute kidney injury (AKI), including anuria, except for managing volume overload [^55d8e23c]. They emphasize that diuretics do not improve renal outcomes, reduce the need for renal replacement therapy, or decrease mortality in AKI patients [^c66af6c4]. Similarly, the **Surviving Sepsis Campaign** advises against using diuretics in septic patients with AKI unless there is clear volume overload, reinforcing the principle that diuretics should not be used to "treat" anuria itself [^3b930925].

---

## Alternative management strategies for anuria

The appropriate management of anuria focuses on **identifying and treating the underlying cause**:

- **Prerenal causes**: Volume resuscitation, blood pressure optimization, and correction of hemodynamic instability [^383fa0aa].
- **Intrinsic renal causes**: Supportive care, avoidance of nephrotoxins, and preparation for renal replacement therapy if indicated [^a16b9cb9].
- **Postrenal causes**: Immediate relief of obstruction through catheterization, nephrostomy, or surgical intervention [^a767ef1a].

Renal replacement therapy (**dialysis**) is indicated when there is persistent anuria with life-threatening indications such as hyperkalemia, metabolic acidosis, or volume overload [^8dda75e0].

---

## Clinical scenarios where diuretics may be considered

Although diuretics are contraindicated in anuria, there are rare scenarios where they may be considered if the patient transitions from anuria to severe oliguria (less than 0.5 mL/kg/h) and there is **clinically significant volume overload** [^55d8e23c]. In such cases, high-dose loop diuretics may be attempted to manage fluid overload, but close monitoring of renal function, electrolytes, and volume status is essential. Even then, the likelihood of response is limited if renal function remains severely impaired [^c66af6c4].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

In summary, **do not attempt to "diurese" a patient with no urine output** (anuria). Diuretics are ineffective and contraindicated in this setting, and their use can cause significant harm. The priority is to identify and treat the underlying cause of anuria, with supportive care and preparation for renal replacement therapy as indicated. Diuretics should only be considered if the patient develops volume overload and even then, with caution and close monitoring.

Oliguria and anuria—Urine output is both a reasonably sensitive functional index for the kidney and a biomarker of tubular injury, but the relationship between urine output, GFR, and tubular injury is complex, and oliguria may be more profound when tubular function is intact. With volume depletion and hypotension, urine volume is minimized and urine concentration maximized (>500 m Osmol/kg), whereas when the tubules are injured, maximal concentrating ability is impaired and urine volume may be normal (nonoliguric renal failure). In oliguria with azotemia, high urine osmolality with low urine sodium is strong evidence of intact tubular function, but this should not be interpreted as “benign” or prerenal azotemia, and classification as “benign azotemia” or “acute renal success” is not consistent with available evidence. Severe oliguria or anuria can also be caused by urinary tract obstruction or total arterial or venous occlusion, which will result in rapid and irreversible kidney damage and require prompt recognition and management.

CONTRAINDICATIONS

Bumetanide is contraindicated in anuria. Although bumetanide can be used to induce diuresis in renal insufficiency, any marked increase in blood urea nitrogen or creatinine, or the development of oliguria during therapy of patients with progressive renal disease, is an indication for discontinuation of treatment with bumetanide. Bumetanide is also contraindicated in patients in hepatic coma or in states of severe electrolyte depletion until the condition is improved or corrected. Bumetanide is contraindicated in patients hypersensitive to this drug.

Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2012). Low credibility.

Although diuresis is mentioned in both RIFLE and AKIN, little attention was initially given to it, and many studies on the accuracy of RIFLE did not take into account diuresis. Recent studies point out that diuresis might be a more sensitive marker of AKI than serum creatinine. More importantly, Macedo et al. demonstrated that the evaluation of diuresis in 6-h blocks is as accurate as hourly observation. This addresses the argument that diuresis is difficult to measure outside the intensive care unit (ICU): It should be possible, even in general wards, to organize monitoring of diuresis in 6- to 8-h intervals, even in patients without a bladder catheter. In view of the perils and co-morbidities associated with bladder catheterization, ERBP recommends to use 6- to 8-h observation blocks of urinary output, in patients with spontaneous miction, rather than performing a bladder catheterization just for the sake of hourly urinary output measurements. ERBP recommends that local nephrologists develop and implement strategies to monitor urinary output in hospitalized patients outside the ICU, but are at risk for AKI. Of note, up to 50% of patients with AKI developed this condition at the general ward, not in an ICU. The use of a weight-adjusted urinary volume as the threshold makes some sense, but can lead to overdiagnosis (false-positive diagnosis) of AKI in obese patients or underdiagnosis (false negatives) in cachectic patients. Therefore, ERBP suggests that ‘ideal’ body weight is considered in these conditions. ‘Ideal’ should be interpreted as the age, length and gender normalized weight, so, e.g. without oedema. It should also be stressed that urinary output criteria should be evaluated in patients not receiving diuretics.

The additional clinical benefit for differential diagnosis of AKI of newer markers of kidney function (e.g. cystatin C) or kidney injury parameters (e.g. neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin) has so far not been proved and is a matter of debate. ERBP at this stage does not recommend their use for diagnostic purposes in clinical conditions.

As hypovolaemia, post-renal causes and nephrotoxic drugs can result in reversible causes and can be readily diagnosed, these should be excluded as soon as possible. Although their prevalence as a cause of AKI is only limited, a minimal work-up for the presence of underlying rapidly progressive forms of glomerular disease should also be performed, especially in the absence of other potential explanations.

### Polyuria in patients with lower urinary tract symptoms: prevalence and etiology [^7ea87245]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2023). Medium credibility.

The 2021 AUA guidelines for the surgical management of BPH do not recommend the routine use of bladder diaries in the initial workup of men with LUTS. The 2014 guideline panel did recommend use of bladder diaries for men experiencing > 2 nocturia episodes. Data from the present study, however, show that 41% of polyuria patients did not experience > 2 nocturnal voids. Therefore, based on the current and past AUA guidelines, failure to utilize bladder diaries in the initial workup of patients with LUTS would fail to identify 18%−41% of these polyuria patients who may benefit from a polyuria specific treatment pathway. The data in the past and present studies reinforce the appropriateness of phenotyping patients based on urinary output and exploring polyuria specific algorithms for patient management.

Polyuria patients with LUTS may simply experience symptoms due to excess fluid intake. However, restricting fluids in a patient with underlying pathologic conditions like DM, DI, or CKD could be very harmful and result in severe dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, coma and even death.Determination of the root causes of polyuria necessitates an exploration of the physiological mechanism behind their current disease etiology.

### Evaluation of polyuria: the roles of solute loading and water diuresis [^d288b2ed]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Polyuria, defined as daily urine output in excess of 3.0 to 3.5L/d, can occur due to solute or water diuresis. Solute-induced polyuria can be seen in hospitalized patients after a high solute load from exogenous protein administration or following relief of urinary obstruction. Similar clinical scenarios are rarely encountered in the outpatient setting. We describe a case of polyuria due to high solute ingestion and excessive water intake leading to a mixed picture of solute and water diuresis. Restriction of the daily solute load and water intake resulted in complete resolution of polyuria. Determination of the daily excreted urinary osmoles may yield important clues to the cause of polyuria and should be included in the routine workup of polyuria.

### Science and fiction in critical care: established concepts with or without evidence? [^23123f00]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Dogma #1: Give fluids, diuretics, and vasopressors if urinary output decreases

Most oliguric intensive care unit (ICU) patients receive fluids, diuretics, and/or vasopressors with the goal to prevent acute kidney injury (AKI). This treatment, however, is based on the belief that AKI in critically ill patients results from renal ischaemia. Whereas fluids and vasopressors are usually administered to increase renal blood flow and in proportion oxygen delivery, diuretics are given to reduce the osmolarity in the renal medulla. This is expected to increase glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and ultimately improve renal function.

Oliguria, however, is a clinical symptom rather than a disease. The underlying mechanisms include, but are not restricted to, hypovolaemia, physiologic stress response, tubular damage, post-renal obstruction or a combination of these factors. If hypovolaemia is not the cause of oliguria, it does not make sense to administer fluids for its treatment. Giving fluids to patients who are not hypovolaemic may in fact harm the kidneys by increasing intracapsular pressure, thereby further reducing urinary output. Hence, administering fluids to these patients may lead into a vicious cycle of infusing more and more fluids to treat oliguria, which is eventually a result of over-hydration. Furthermore, if functional renal damage is present, e.g. due to ischaemia or nephrotoxins, treating oliguria with fluids or diuretics is unlikely to improve renal function. In this context, it is also noteworthy that the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines for AKI recommend neither fluid therapy beyond the correction of hypovolaemia nor diuretics for the treatment of AKI. This is supported by the fact that clinical evidence for a sustained increase in urine output or improvement in renal blood flow secondary to fluids and/or diuretics is lacking. Conversely, indiscriminately giving fluids to oliguric patients increases the risk of fluid overload with negative consequences on morbidity. Although fluid overload has been identified as independent risk factor for AKI in critically ill patients, “fill and spill” (“fill” the circulation and urine will “spill”) is still a dogma in many ICUs. Likewise, the concept of “squeeze and diurese” is commonly applied. It aims to increase mean arterial blood pressure with vasopressors (“squeeze”) and at the same time administer loop diuretics to paralyse the medulla and avoid ischaemia (“diurese”). Interestingly, no randomised controlled trials (RCTs) support the latter treatment strategies.

### Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis: from pathophysiology to management [^0373a245]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Electrolyte-free water administration (eg, oral water, or IV 5% dextrose) is critical in managing overcorrection. The European guidelines recommend a bolus of 10 mL/kg of electrolyte-free water over 1 hour (eg, 500-1000 mL over 1 h for patients 50-100 kg). International expert panel guidelines recommend commencing an infusion of 3 mL/kg/h of IV 5% dextrose (ie, 150-300 mL/h for patients weighing 50-100 kg) continuing, with hourly monitoring, until the pNa has returned below the 24-hour limit. We favor the larger upfront bolus in line with the European guidelines, then reassessment before any ongoing infusion. The Adrogué-Madias formula can be used to estimate the sodium-lowering effect of 1000 mL of dextrose 5% with the caveat that this formula assumes no net electrolyte-free water clearance or retention occurs as the dextrose is administered (see Fig. 2). If the pNa is rising faster than desired but has not yet exceeded the maximum target, an infusion of dextrose 5% can be used to prevent further increments. As a rule of thumb, matching the rate of fluid input to hourly urine output (an imperfect indicator of electrolyte-free water clearance) should stabilize pNa in this instance.

Desmopressin, an AVP analogue, may be administered either IV or subcutaneously at a dose of 1 to 2 mcg, to reduce urine output and prevent further increments in pNa. DDAVP is particularly useful in polyuric patients, in situations when a reversible stimulus to AVP is no longer present and accumulated free water is being rapidly excreted (heralded by hypotonic polyuria, ie, low UNa and osmolality). In this context, rather than “chasing” polyuria by attempting to match urine output with high volumes of 5% dextrose or oral free water, urine output is curtailed, allowing judicious administration of electrolyte-free water to actively relower serum sodium, usually in an intensively monitored setting (eg, high dependency or ICU) with frequent (eg, 1-2 hourly) serum sodium monitoring. Clinicians should be aware that desmopressin may not be effective in halting overcorrection from tolvaptan because of AVP receptor blockade, depending on the duration of tolvaptan effect at the renal collecting duct cells. DDAVP is contraindicated for patients with primary polydipsia, in which oral fluid intake cannot be reliably restricted.

### Pathological post-obstructive diuresis following obstructive uropathy due to constipation in the post-partum period: a case report [^7607782c]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Constipation during pregnancy is not uncommon. Usually, this does not warrant extensive evaluation and settles with minor interventions or lifestyle modifications. Severe fecal impaction in chronically constipated patients can rarely lead to obstructive uropathy. Relief of obstruction can result in a diuretic phase which may be self-limiting or pathological. However, occurrence of pathological post-obstructive diuresis as a result of severe constipation is an extremely rare complication during pregnancy and puerperium which can even be fatal if not promptly diagnosed and adequately monitored and timely intervened. We describe the management of a pathological post-obstructive diuresis which occurred in the immediate postpartum period after treatment of severe constipation and obstructive uropathy.

Case Presentation

A woman who had undergone an emergency caesarean section due to deep transverse arrest 1 week ago, presented with fecal impaction and anuria. On relief of urinary obstruction which had developed secondary to fecal impaction, she developed pathological post-obstructive diuresis. Careful and timely monitoring with exact fluid replacement, correction of electrolyte imbalances and multidisciplinary care ensured complete recovery of the patient.

Conclusions

Despite obstructive uropathy being uncommon in obstetric practice, clinicians need to have a high index of suspicion to monitor and promptly manage the potentially life-threatening condition of post-obstructive diuresis in pregnant and puerperal women undergoing urinary tract decompression. Due to unreliability of laboratory cutoff values in pregnancy and puerperium, a more vigilant and multidisciplinary approach with lower threshold for intervention is more prudent in the management of these patients.

### Bumetanide (Bumex) [^8b328e6c]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

CONTRAINDICATIONS

Bumex is contraindicated in anuria. Although Bumex can be used to induce diuresis in renal insufficiency, any marked increase in blood urea nitrogen or creatinine, or the development of oliguria during therapy of patients with progressive renal disease, is an indication for discontinuation of treatment with Bumex.  Bumex is also contraindicated in patients in hepatic coma or in states of severe electrolyte depletion until the condition is improved or corrected.  Bumex is contraindicated in patients hypersensitive to this drug.

### Oliguria: an earlier and accurate biomarker of acute kidney injury? [^b2074254]. Kidney International (2011). Low credibility.

In the context of the critically ill patient, the onset of consistent oliguria is an ominous sign that requires immediate attention. Without intervention, intermittent oliguria may turn into persistent oliguria or evolve to acute kidney injury (AKI), with severe associated morbidity and mortality. Whether the addition of urine output to the serum creatinine criteria permits earlier and more specific detection of AKI is controversial, but current evidence supports its importance in early diagnosis and management.

### Fluid management protocols in hemodialysis patients using bioimpedance validation: time to look elsewhere? [^dcc7e466]. Kidney International (2023). Medium credibility.

The management of volume status in dialysis patients is an important determinant of the rate of decline of residual kidney function. The implementation of clinical protocols to guide volume management in the in-center hemodialysis unit resulted in comparable rates of development of anuria and decline in residual kidney function when compared with bioimpedance spectroscopy-guided volume management. Clinical judgment and experience are important drivers of patient outcomes. The importance and applicability of bioimpedance spectroscopy in other clinical settings, such as units without clear volume management protocols or in home dialysis units, remain to be seen.

### Approach to the patient with suspected hypotonic polyuria [^01cb98f9]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical Suspicion

Patients who have symptoms of polyuria, nocturia, or polydipsia are candidates for further evaluation of a possible arginine vasopressin-related polyuria (AVP-D or AVP-R). However, before embarking on more complex pathways of investigation, it is important to exclude common causes of polyuria and polydipsia, including hypokalemia and hypercalcemia. Certain scenarios are suggestive of a solute diuresis, for example uncontrolled hyperglycemia, high protein intake from parenteral or enteral feeding, tissue catabolism from high-dose glucocorticoids, resolving kidney injury including relief of urinary obstruction, use of diuretics and SGLT-2 inhibitors, administration of mannitol or high volumes of isotonic NaCl. The presence of nocturia without daytime polyuria suggests nocturnal polyuria (production of 20%-33% of total urine volume during sleep). In the absence of such obvious causes of symptomatic polyuria, possible AVP-related disorders should be evaluated. The first step is measurement of plasma osmolality and/or serum sodium concentration. Although these are within normal ranges in most patients with polyuria due to the ability of thirst and renal water excretion to maintain osmotic homeostasis, hypernatremia strongly suggests AVP-D or AVP-R, and hyponatremia strongly suggests PP as the most likely causes of polyuria. If the plasma osmolality and serum sodium are normal, the next step is confirming the presence of hypotonic polyuria. Because patients’ estimations of both fluid intake and urine output are not always reliable, this should be assessed via measurement of a 24-hour urine. It is notable that there is no universally accepted definition of polyuria. Past studies have used an absolute urine volume (eg, ≥ 3 L/24 hours in adults and ≥ 2 L/m 2 /24 hours in children), and others have used a weight-based urine volume (eg, > 40 mL/kg/24 hours or > 50 mL/kg/24 hours). Consequently, clinical judgment and experience should be used to identify patients requiring further evaluation, but the least stringent criteria would be either a urine volume ≥ 3 L/24 hours in adults and ≥ 2 L/m 2 /24 hours in children, or > 40 mL/kg/24 hours. If these minimal criteria are not met, the patient should undergo urological evaluation for causes of increased urine frequency or nocturnal polyuria. Once polyuria is established, the second step is to confirm hypotonicity via measurement of osmolality in the 24 hours urine sample. A urine osmolality ≤ 300 mOsm/kg H 2 O confirms a hypotonic urine, and a urine osmolality ≥ 800 mOsm/kg H 2 O indicates a solute diuresis (due to glucose, sodium, urea, or administered diuretics such as mannitol). Urine osmolalities between 300 and 800 mOsm/kg H 2 O can be seen with partial AVP-D or AVP-R, so in such cases further evaluation is necessary. Once hypotonic polyuria is confirmed, additional testing is necessary to identify the cause (Table 1).

1.2: Risk assessment

1.2.1 We recommend that patients be stratified for risk of AKI according to their susceptibilities, especially pre-existing proteinuria and CKD, and exposures to nephrotoxic medication or interventions. (1C)
1.2.2 We recommend monitoring patients at increased risk for AKI with measurements of serum creatinine and urine output to detect AKI at an early stage. (Ungraded statement). Frequency and duration of monitoring should be planned based on patient risk and clinical course. (Ungraded statement).
1.2.3 We recommend developing and implementing pathways of care at the broader hospital level, in close collaboration with the other individual specialities, to achieve the above-mentioned targets. (Ungraded statement).

Rationale

Risk for AKI is increased by exposure to factors that cause AKI (e.g. nephrotoxic medication) or the presence of factors that increase susceptibility to AKI [e.g. dehydration, co-morbidities, and also pre-existing proteinuria and chronic kidney disease (CKD)]. The interaction between susceptibility and the type and extent of exposure to insults determines the risk of AKI occurrence. Particularly in the hospital setting, the patient's susceptibility should be assessed on a regular basis and some factors modified or even avoided (e.g. administration of potentially nephrotoxic agents). ERBP wants to point out that in patients on dialysis, but with preserved diuresis, it can be of importance to follow-up this parameter after procedures with a risk of deterioration of residual renal function, as unnoticed loss of residual renal function is an important risk factor in this patient group.

As prevention is still the best ‘treatment’ of AKI, and as many cases of avoidable AKI do not occur in patients in the ICU or on the nephrology ward, but in general wards, ERBP stresses the importance of developing and implementing pathways of care to detect and monitor patients at risk of AKI outside nephrology units and ICUs. These pathways should be developed in collaboration with the different involved specialities, to address the specific needs and risks per particular patient group. Even if patients are only seen after having been exposed to a risk factor, they still should be assessed in order to identify those who are more likely to develop AKI, as well as those who will require closer monitoring and general supportive measures in order to avoid further injury.

### Undercorrection of hypernatremia is frequent and associated with mortality [^ac8a2b3d]. BMC Nephrology (2014). Low credibility.

Conclusion

This is the first study assessing outcome of hypernatremic patients in an ED according to the provided treatment. It suggests that medical management of hypernatremic patients must be improved regarding evaluation (weight, diuresis, urinary ionogram) and management (type of solute, perfusion speed) and that a too slow correction speed is associated with an increased risk of death regardless of initial natremia.

### Fluid management in acute kidney injury [^0611d29d]. Intensive Care Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) and fluids are closely linked through oliguria, which is a marker of the former and a trigger for administration of the latter. Recent progress in this field has challenged the physiological and clinical rational of using oliguria as a trigger for the administration of fluid and brought attention to the delicate balance between benefits and harms of different aspects of fluid management in critically ill patients, in particular those with AKI. This narrative review addresses various aspects of fluid management in AKI outlining physiological aspects, the effects of crystalloids and colloids on kidney function and the effect of various resuscitation and de-resuscitation strategies on the course and outcome of AKI.

### Approach to the patient with suspected hypotonic polyuria [^bebc64b7]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

It is common for endocrinologists to receive referred patients who have polyuria and polydipsia that need investigation. When initial investigations reveal the urine to be hypotonic, differentiating between the 3 main causes is essential, as the management differs for each. Over the past 2 years, due to concerns about patient safety and in response to patient feedback, the causes of hypotonic polyuria have been renamed as arginine vasopressin deficiency (AVP-D, formerly central diabetes insipidus), arginine vasopressin resistance (AVP-R, formerly nephrogenic diabetes insipidus), while the name of the third cause is retained as primary polydipsia (PP), in which excess fluid intake suppresses AVP secretion. In a survey of more than one thousand patients with AVP-D, the large majority had experienced confusion of their condition by health care workers with diabetes mellitus, resulting in delays in availability of desmopressin and unnecessary capillary glucose monitoring when hospitalized, and 85% favored changing the name. The new nomenclature more accurately reflects pathophysiology and clearly identifies the patients’ condition as different from diabetes mellitus, and now has been adopted by the Systemized Nomenclature of Medicine (SNOMED) taxonomy hierarchy codes for electronic patient records. In parallel, the last several years have seen improvements in the diagnostic tools used for the investigation of hypotonic polyuria, with a particular emphasis on the use of measurement of plasma copeptin. This Approach to the Patient review presents the use of this copeptin-based approach in 3 specific cases, and places each in the context of the revised nomenclature. We then describe the overall approach to the patient presenting with hypotonic polyuria, itemize the causes, and discuss when and how testing should be performed (Fig. 1), highlighting specific areas that frequently cause diagnostic and management difficulties.

### Urinary sodium analysis: the key to effective diuretic titration? European journal of heart failure expert consensus document [^13c90553]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2025). Medium credibility.

In patients with heart failure, neurohumoral activation leads to increased renal sodium avidity across the entire renal tubules, resulting in a positive sodium and water balance, leading to decompensated heart failure requiring intravenous diuretics. As the dose of diuretic therapy required to achieve euvolaemia is difficult to estimate due to considerable intra- and interindividual differences, the European Society of Cardiology recommends assessment of the diuretic response within hours either via evaluation of the urinary sodium concentration or via urinary volume after initial diuretic administration. All diuretic agents enhance sodium excretion to a different extent depending on their side of action across the renal tubules, and renal adaptation mechanisms due to neurohumoral stimulation. Impaired sodium excretion, even in the presence of fluid loss, is associated with worse clinical outcomes. Therefore, assessing urinary sodium excretion is considered a good and direct marker of the diuretic efficacy. Such natriuresis-guided protocols have been tested prospectively by the Pragmatic Urinary Sodium-based algoritHm in Acute Heart Failure and the Efficacy of a Standardized Diuretic Protocol in Acute Heart Failure study, both demonstrating increased natriuresis and diuresis. Moreover, the Readily Available Urinary Sodium Analysis in Patients with Acute Decompensated Heart Failure study has demonstrated that a nurse-led natriuresis-guided protocol is feasible through the use of a point-of-care urinary sodium sensor, allowing an immediately readable urinary sodium result, enabling fast changes in diuretic therapy. This review summaries the rationale, current evidence and gaps supporting the role of urinary sodium concentration in patients with acute decompensated heart failure.

### Oliguria, volume overload, and loop diuretics [^a07f0344]. Critical Care Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is commonly and increasingly encountered in patients with critical illness. In the past, epidemiologic studies have consistently found that oliguria further increases the risk of death from AKI. Compared with patients outside the intensive care unit (ICU), critically ill patients are more likely to have volume overload as a result of impaired solute and water excretion. Recently, broad changes have occurred in ICU practice, such as early goal-directed therapy in sepsis, which may further compound volume overload in the ICU patient with oliguric AKI. Evidence has also emerged to suggest that a positive fluid accumulation in ICU patients can unfavorably affect outcome. Thus, the ICU patient with oliguric AKI presents a dilemma with limited therapeutic options. These would include optimization of systemic hemodynamics, added fluid therapy, administration of loop diuretics, or finally, the initiation of renal replacement therapy. Interestingly, recent survey data and observational studies indicate that a majority of intensivists use loop diuretics, specifically furosemide, at some point during the course of illness in patients with AKI. Paradoxically, loop diuretics have been found in several clinical studies of patients with AKI to be potentially detrimental or, at the least, lack effectiveness for improving clinical outcomes. This contradiction between clinical practice and available evidence would suggest there is equipoise and need for higher-quality evidence to better characterize the role of loop diuretics in ICU patients with AKI.

Renal replacement therapy initiation timing in sepsis-associated acute kidney injury—In adults with sepsis or septic shock and AKI, with no definitive indications for renal replacement therapy, we suggest against using renal replacement therapy. Weak recommendation, moderate quality of evidence. Evidence informing this includes a new RCT that included 488 patients with AKI and septic shock and was stopped early after the second planned interim analysis for futility; eligibility required septic shock within 48 hours of the onset of vasopressor therapy and AKI criteria including oliguria (< 0.3 mL/kg/hr for ≥ 24 hours) or anuria for 12 hours or more. The STARRT-AKI trial randomized 3,000 participants and demonstrated no difference in mortality, with no differential effect in the a priori sepsis subgroup of 1,689 patients. An updated metaanalysis found no effect of the timing of initiation of renal replacement therapy on mortality and renal recovery, and overall the balance of effects favored delayed rather than early initiation of RRT, principally driven by a higher rate of CVAD infection in the early initiation.

### As the river flows: a case report of post obstructive diuresis [^eb1de6f3]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Post obstructive diuresis (PObD) is a medical complication that occurs after a period of urinary obstruction. It is defined as a prolonged production of urine of at least 200 cc/hour for two consecutive hours or over 3 L of urine production over a 24-hour period following relief of urinary retention or an obstructive uropathy. Physiologic PObD lasts for 24 h while pathologic PObD lasts for over more than a 48-hour period and can lead to massive electrolyte deficiencies as well as the possibility of hypotension and consequent shock. The typical pathophysiology of pathologic PObD involves medullary washout from urinary retention and tubular injury, downregulation of sodium transport receptors in the thick ascending loop of Henle, a reduction in the glomerular filtration rate (GFR), and a poor response to antidiuretic hormone (ADH). Guidelines on the treatment of PObD rely on the regulation of fluid maintenance, however, they do not definitively describe how to manage contributive factors to the pathology. We discuss the case of a patient who developed severe PObD with a tailored approach to treating the underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms contributing to pathologic PObD while utilizing markers to guide patient management.

Case Presentation

A 79-year-old male with a past medical history of severe aortic stenosis, coronary artery disease, hyperlipidemia and mild Alzheimer's disease presented with invasive bladder cancer and consequent obstructive uropathy. An ileal conduit was created. Massive urinary diuresis occurred for more than 48 h once the obstruction was relieved and subsequently, our patient went into shock. Nephrology was consulted and a treatment plan was initiated that targeted appropriate fluid administration to overcome the massive diuresis while also focusing on improving the medullary gradient and response to anti-diuretic hormone. Our patient's condition improved after our multifaceted therapeutic approach.

Conclusion

This case report highlights the importance of maintaining appropriate fluid administration to treat fluid loss while avoiding augmentation of the diuresis. We also demonstrate the significance of a treatment plan that targets the pathophysiological mechanisms contributing to PObD to help treat our patient's condition.

### Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis: from pathophysiology to management [^4eb472bc]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Hyponatremia is the most common electrolyte disorder, affecting more than 15% of patients in the hospital. Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis (SIAD) is the most frequent cause of hypotonic hyponatremia, mediated by nonosmotic release of arginine vasopressin (AVP, previously known as antidiuretic hormone), which acts on the renal V2 receptors to promote water retention. There are a variety of underlying causes of SIAD, including malignancy, pulmonary pathology, and central nervous system pathology. In clinical practice, the etiology of hyponatremia is frequently multifactorial and the management approach may need to evolve during treatment of a single episode. It is therefore important to regularly reassess clinical status and biochemistry, while remaining alert to potential underlying etiological factors that may become more apparent during the course of treatment. In the absence of severe symptoms requiring urgent intervention, fluid restriction (FR) is widely endorsed as the first-line treatment for SIAD in current guidelines, but there is considerable controversy regarding second-line therapy in instances where FR is unsuccessful, which occurs in around half of cases. We review the epidemiology, pathophysiology, and differential diagnosis of SIAD, and summarize recent evidence for therapeutic options beyond FR, with a focus on tolvaptan, urea, and sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors.

### International continence society consensus on the diagnosis and treatment of nocturia [^e14c8faf]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Patients with nocturia have to face many hurdles before being diagnosed and treated properly. The aim of this paper is to: summarize the nocturia patient pathway, explore how nocturia is diagnosed and treated in the real world and use the Delphi method to develop a practical algorithm with a focus on what steps need to be taken before prescribing desmopressin.

Methods

Evidence comes from existing guidelines (Google, PubMed), International Consultation on Incontinence-Research Society (ICI-RS) 2017, prescribing information and a Delphi panel (3 rounds). The International Continence Society initiated this study, the authors represent the ICI-RS, European Association of Urology, and Society of Urodynamics, Female Pelvic Medicine and Urogenital Reconstruction (SUFU).

Results

Diagnostic packages: consensus on, history taking for all causalities, intake diary (fluid, food) and bladder diary, not for its duration. Pelvic (women) or rectal (men) examination, prostate-specific antigen, serum sodium check (SSC), renal function, endocrine screening: when judged necessary. Timing or empty stomach when SSC is not important. Therapeutic packages: the safe candidates for desmopressin can be phenotyped as no polydipsia, heart/kidney failure, severe leg edema or obstructive sleep apnea syndrome. Lifestyle interventions may be useful. Initiating desmopressin: risk management consensus on three clinical pictures. Follow-up of desmopressin therapy: there was consensus on SSC day 3 to 7, and at 1 month. Stop therapy if SSC is <130mmol/L regardless of symptoms. Stop if SSC is 130 to 135mmol/L with symptoms of hyponatremia.

Conclusion

A summary of the nocturia patient pathway across different medical specialists is useful in the visualization and phenotyping of patients for diagnosis and therapy. By summarizing basic knowledge of desmopressin, we aim to ease its initiation and shorten the patient journey for nocturia.

### New horizons in the diagnosis and management of dehydration [^4dc76c4b]. Age and Ageing (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hydration is a fundamental but confusing area of practice for clinicians working with older people. There is little doubt that addressing dehydration can prevent and treat common disorders such as urinary tract infections, acute kidney injury, orthostatic hypotension, constipation and delirium. However, the assessment of dehydration can be rather subjective, non-evidence based and affected by multiple factors. Once identified, reversing dehydration can be challenging as it often involves behavioural change and overcoming barriers such engrained habits and fear of incontinence.

### Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis: from pathophysiology to management [^40a101e9]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

There is no universally recommended FR limit. For FR to be effective, there must be negative fluid balance—with electrolyte-free water output exceeding input. For this reason, US recommendations suggest FR that is 500 mL below the 24-hour urine output, which is a “rule of thumb” to achieve this (given the difficulty of measuring insensible losses). For consistency, most available studies evaluate FR in the range of 500 to 1000 mL. The efficacy of a 1000-mL FR was recently evaluated in comparison to no treatment, in a randomized trial in 46 patients (mean age 73 years) with chronic asymptomatic hyponatremia, mean baseline pNa 127 mmol/L. This trial observed a modest early rise in serum sodium of 3 mmol/L in fluid-restricted patients, compared to 1 mmol/L with no treatment (allowed ad libitum fluid intake, average intake 1.5 L). However, 39% patients assigned to FR did not respond, with serum sodium persistently below 130 mmol/L after 3 days. Notably, 9 of 23 (39%) participants receiving no treatment achieved pNa greater than or equal to 130 mmol/L after 4 days, illustrating a relatively high rate of “spontaneous correction” even in chronic hyponatremia. These results were similar to the Thai EFFUSE-FLUID trial of 92 participants with hyponatremia, mean age 59 years, that evaluated FR (limit 500-1000 mL), determined based on urine/serum electrolyte ratio (ie, Fürst ratio, discussed later) with or without furosemide and oral salt tablets. This trial reported a mean increase in pNa of 5 mmol/L after 4 days in the 31 patients allocated to FR alone; however, there was no control group. In the group allocated to FR alone, 52% had pNa persistently below 130 mmol/L after 4 days and 26% had pNa less than 130 mmol/L after 30 days. Regarding the “dose” of FR, across this study as a whole, 57% participants were allocated to FR less than 1000 mL and 43% to less than 500 mL, based on prespecified criteria for urine:serum electrolyte ratio. Adherence to FR was much lower, with the 500 mL limit (43% vs 79% for the 1000 mL limit) suggesting this tighter limit was not as well tolerated. In a Swiss prospective observational trial, total daily fluid intake (above or below 500 mL) was not significantly associated with nonresponse to FR, indicating marginal benefit to a tighter restriction. In general, a FR limit of 1000 mL per day is the most widely studied, and any benefits to a restriction limit below this are unproven.

### Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis: from pathophysiology to management [^493a79da]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

After achieving an initial modest sodium increase, sufficient to prevent acute outcomes related to raised ICP, the focus turns to prevention of further rapid sodium rise to avoid overcorrection and ODS. Indeed, often the real challenge in managing severe hypotonic hyponatremia of chronic (> 24 hours) or unknown duration is to prevent this potentially deleterious overshoot. Relowering of serum sodium with IV 5% dextrose, with or without desmopressin to reduce urine output may be required, typically in a high-dependency setting, to maintain sodium rise ideally to 5 to 8 mmol above baseline within 24 hours, with a limit of no more than 10 to 12 mmol within 24 hours (see “In Case of Overcorrection: Relowering of Plasma Sodium”). In patients with risk factors for ODS (see Table 3), one should aim for even slower corrections, 4 to 6 mmol within 24 hours and a limit of 8 mmol/L in any 24-hour period, especially as such an increment is generally sufficient to prevent adverse clinical outcomes from acute hyponatremia-associated increase in ICP (see “Acute Severe Hyponatremia”).

### Nocturnal polyuria is related to 24-hour diuresis and osmotic excretion in an enuresis population referred to a tertiary center [^0fd7991b]. The Journal of Urology (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose

Primary nocturnal enuresis is a heterogeneous disorder, causing a mismatch between overnight diuresis volume and functional bladder capacity. Despite increasing insights in pathogenesis, lack of efficacy of the available treatments is a major problem. We evaluated characteristics of bladder volume and diuresis rate in patients with nocturnal enuresis referred to a tertiary enuresis center.

Materials and Methods

Noninvasive screening including maximal voided volume, 24-hour circadian rhythm of diuresis and osmotic excretion from 1,000 consecutive patients.

Results

Of the patients referred as having monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis 32% were subsequently classified as having nonmonosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis. Differences in bladder volume and nocturnal diuresis characteristics between the monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis and nonmonosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis groups were minimal.

Conclusions

The most common observation is a nocturnal diuresis volume greater than maximal voided volume, which in both groups can be caused by nocturnal polyuria or small bladder volume for patient age. The most striking observation is that the positive correlation between nocturnal diuresis volume rate and nocturnal osmotic excretion and 24-hour fluid intake is significantly higher than with the inversed urinary osmolality overnight, which is not only unexpected based on the theory of the primary suppression of vasopressin levels overnight, but also points to a more important role for nutritional and fluid intake than accepted, if not in the primary pathogenesis, then at least in therapy resistance.

Systematic reviews of frusemide (furosemide) reported no significant effect on in-hospital mortality, RRT requirement, dialysis sessions, or persistent oliguria, with pooled RR for mortality of 2.67 (95% CI 0.75–7.25; P = 0.115) and for RRT incidence of 4.08 (95% CI 0.46–35.96; P = 0.21) versus placebo. Prophylactic furosemide was found to be ineffective or harmful after cardiac surgery and to increase the risk of AKI when given to prevent CI-AKI. In the largest trial including 338 patients with AKI requiring dialysis, patients randomized to furosemide (25 mg/kg/d i.v. or 35 mg/kg/d orally) versus placebo reached 2 l/d diuresis sooner (5.7 days vs 7.8 days, P = 0.004) without differences in survival or number of dialysis sessions, and current evidence does not suggest that furosemide can reduce mortality in patients with AKI.

### KDIGO 2025 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation, management, and treatment of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) [^44e98daa]. Kidney International (2025). High credibility.

Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) water intake and diet—people with ADPKD should be advised to maintain optimal hydration; plain drinking water, mainly obtained from tap water, is the preferred fluid for drinking in people with ADPKD, and the consumption of drinks with added sugar and/or salt or alcohol should be minimized. A high dietary solute load requires a higher fluid intake to maintain dilute urine, and people with ADPKD should be educated about the importance of dietary solute intake in determining obligatory urine volume; as outlined in Chapter 7, people with ADPKD should be advised to achieve and maintain a moderate protein intake (0.8–1.0 g/kg/d, per WHO recommendations) and limit sodium (Na) intake (Na <2 g/d [<90 mmol/d] or <5 g salt/d). No evidence indicates that the source or type of water (tap, bottled, filtered) is important to the progression of kidney cyst growth; prior self-reported estimates suggest most people (61%) with ADPKD probably have a high habitual intake of fluid (≥ 2 L/d). For implementation context, the increase in urine volume in 3 RCTs was ~0.8 L/d. Safety considerations include that water intake that vastly exceeds population-based recommendations can lead to life-threatening hyponatremia, and in a systematic review of 590 people without ADPKD with life-threatening hyponatremia, psychogenic polydipsia and iatrogenic advice were identified as underlying factors in 68% of cases. The overall grade of certainty of evidence is very low.

### KDOQI US commentary on the 2012 KDIGO clinical practice guideline for acute kidney injury [^0380416f]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2013). Medium credibility.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) definition—urine output criteria: Both RIFLE and AKIN included duration of oliguria in their definitions and staging criteria, but studies found poor calibration between urine output criteria and serum creatinine criteria and poor prognostic correlation between briefer durations of oliguria and small changes in serum creatinine level. Oliguria may reflect under-resuscitation rather than kidney injury, and the weight-based urine output definition limits use in obesity, such that under the current definition, urine output of 40 mL/h in a 90-kg patient for 12 hours would lead to classification as stage 2 AKI. Diuretic administration has been shown to change RIFLE classification by urine output criteria, and pharmacologic agents such as loop diuretics or dopamine may not be helpful and may even be harmful in some settings. While inclusion of urine output criteria may encourage documentation of urine output and overall fluid balance, there are risks of unintended consequences with defining transient oliguria as AKI, and the authors state that current data are inadequate to support reliance on oliguria as a surrogate end point in clinical trials or in performance metrics. In pediatrics, reliance on urine output and weight-based fluid balance makes inclusion reasonable; nonetheless, further research is needed and practitioners should recognize that many of the same limitations to the use of urine output criteria apply in the pediatric population.

Pediatric drug stewardship considerations in chronic kidney disease—many children with CKD with underlying tubular disorders have an obligate urine output irrespective of their hydration status and are at a particularly high risk of hypotension and AKI during an acute dehydrating illness; during an illness, a clear plan of when to restart discontinued medications should be communicated to people with CKD and documented in the medical record, and parents and carers should be central to drug stewardship for children with CKD, with increasing involvement from the young person as they move toward transition.

Prevention of AKI

Diuretics may be used to manage volume overload secondary to AKI and increase potassium excretion.Administration of loop diuretics has been shown to reverse oligo-anuria, revealing patients with less severe renal injury or adequate renal reserve,but has not been shown to prevent AKI, need for renal replacement therapy, or overall mortality. Judicious fluid administration combined with loop diuretics (i.e. “matched hydration”) may increase tubular flow of filtrate without volume depletion and associated renal hypoperfusion – ; however, further randomized control trials are necessary before this strategy can be broadly recommended in the prevention of postoperative AKI.

Despite initially promising studies,, neither preoperative aspirin nor clonidine reduced the risk of postoperative AKI in the POISE-2 randomized trial of noncardiac surgery patients.Dexamethasone potentially attenuates the systemic inflammatory response to cardiopulmonary bypass and reducing inflammatory mediators, but the Dexamethasone in Cardiac Surgery (DECS) trial and the Steroids in Cardiac Surgery (SIRS) trial failed to support prophylactic use of steroids during cardiac surgery. Finally, a meta-analysis found no evidence that N-acetylcysteine improved renal outcomes after major surgery; therefore, the KDIGO management guidelines recommend against using oral or intravenous N-acetylcysteine for prevention of postsurgical AKI.

Management of Postoperative AKI

The Acute Disease Quality Initiative and PeriOperative Quality Initiative consensus report recommends determining and resolving the underlying cause of postoperative AKI.Mainstays of management include removal or avoidance of nephrotoxic exposure and hemodynamic optimization. Renal perfusion can be maintained through a combination of fluids and vasopressors, with protocol-based management to prevent worsening AKI in high-risk perioperative patients. Diuretics should not be used in the treatment of AKI, except to manage volume overload.A number of agents including dopamine, fenoldopam, atrial natriuretic peptide, insulin-like growth factor-1, and diuretics have failed to improve the course of AKI and do not have a role in the management of AKI.

Renal replacement therapy timing and use without definitive indications—adults with sepsis or septic shock and AKI: we suggest against using renal replacement therapy when there are no definitive indications for renal replacement therapy (Weak recommendation, moderate quality of evidence). A new RCT comparing early versus delayed RRT in septic shock with AKI included 488 patients and was stopped early for futility; eligible patients had septic shock within 48 hours of vasopressor therapy onset and AKI defined as oliguria (< 0.3 mL/kg/hr for ≥ 24 hours), anuria for 12 hours or more, or a serum creatinine increase of ≥ 0.5 mg/dL. The STARRT-AKI trial randomized 3,000 participants and demonstrated no difference in mortality between accelerated and “standard” RRT, with no differential effect in the a priori sepsis subgroup of 1,689 patients. An updated metaanalysis observed no effect of initiation timing on mortality and renal recovery, and overall the balance of effects favored delayed rather than early initiation, driven by a higher rate of central venous access device (CVAD) infection in the “early” initiation.

RIFLE and AKIN criteria for acute kidney injury—adult thresholds—define severity by serum creatinine (SCr) change and urine output. Risk is “Increased SCr to >1.5× baseline” or urine output “<0.5 mL/kg/h for >6 h.” Injury is “Increased SCr to >2× baseline” or urine output “<0.5 mL/kg/h for >12 h.” Failure is “Increased SCr to >3× baseline; or an increase of ≥0.5 mg/dL to a value of ≥4 mg/dL” or urine output “<0.3 mL/kg/h for >12 h or anuria for >12 h.” AKIN staging aligns as: Stage 1 “Increase in SCr ≥0.3 mg/dL or increase in SCr to ≥150%-200% of baseline,” Stage 2 “Increase in SCr to >200%-300% of baseline,” and Stage 3 “Increase in SCr to >300% of baseline; or to ≥4 mg/dL with an acute increase of ≥0.5 mg/dL; or on RRT.” Progression categories include “Loss Need for RRT for >4 wk” and “End stage Need for RRT for >3 mo.” Timing qualifiers specify “For RIFLE, the increase in SCr should be both abrupt (within 1-7 days) and sustained (>24 hours)” and “For AKIN, the increase in SCR must occur in less than 48 hours,” and abbreviations define “RRT” and “SCr.”

ADPKD—General advice regarding water intake in the absence of tolvaptan—We suggest adapting water intake, spread throughout the day, to achieve at least 2–3 liters of water intake per day in people with ADPKD and an eGFR ≥30 ml/min per 1.73 m2 without contraindications to excreting a solute load (2D). People with ADPKD should be provided individualized advice about the amount of water consumption that they need for maintaining hydration, what behaviors achieve this, what drinks to drink, and how to recognize signs of dehydration. The Work Group defined high water intake as habitual water intake to achieve at least 2 liters of urine per day in people with ADPKD and an eGFR ≥30 ml/min per 1.73 m2 who do not have contraindications, and minimal risks are associated with increased water intake to produce a urine output of between 2–3 l/d in people with an eGFR ≥30 ml/min per 1.73 m2 and without contraindications to excreting a solute load. Relative contraindications include baseline hyponatremia (<135 mmol/l), risk of fluid overload (heart failure, cirrhosis), requirement for fluid restriction, and use of medications that may increase the risk of hyponatremia (SSRIs, TCAs) or thiazides used for BP control.

### Diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia: compilation of the guidelines [^cd2360f3]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia is a common water balance disorder that often poses a diagnostic or therapeutic challenge. Therefore, guidelines were developed by professional organizations, one from within the United States (2013) and one from within Europe (2014). This review discusses the diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia, comparing the two guidelines and highlighting recent developments. Diagnostically, the initial step is to differentiate hypotonic from nonhypotonic hyponatremia. Hypotonic hyponatremia is further differentiated on the basis of urine osmolality, urine sodium level, and volume status. Recently identified parameters, including fractional uric acid excretion and plasma copeptin concentration, may further improve the diagnostic approach. The treatment for hyponatremia is chosen on the basis of duration and symptoms. For acute or severely symptomatic hyponatremia, both guidelines adopted the approach of giving a bolus of hypertonic saline. Although fluid restriction remains the first-line treatment for most forms of chronic hyponatremia, therapy to increase renal free water excretion is often necessary. Vasopressin receptor antagonists, urea, and loop diuretics serve this purpose, but received different recommendations in the two guidelines. Such discrepancies may relate to different interpretations of the limited evidence or differences in guideline methodology. Nevertheless, the development of guidelines has been important in advancing this evolving field.

### Diabetes mellitus in dialysis and renal transplantation [^abc9a726]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Severe hyperglycaemia in ESKF

Severe hyperglycaemia is a serious complication in diabetic patients. As patients with ESKF are either oliguric or anuric, the severe dehydration and hypernatraemia seen in the hyperosmolar hyperglycaemic state (HHS) due to diuresis does not occur. Therefore, ESKF patients with severe hyperglycaemia tend be asymptomatic.A major concern in these patients is that, due to extracellular hypertonicity, potassium and fluid may shift extracellularly to cause hyperkalaemia and acute intravascular volume expansion.

Due to oliguria or anuria, ESKF patients with DKA tend to be protected from the severe dehydration seen with DKA in preserved renal function. Rather than a focus on fluid resuscitation, management consists of intravenous insulin infusion with close monitoring of serum glucose and potassium. Due to severe hyperglycaemia, patients are presumed to be hyperkalaemic and should not receive intravenous potassium-containing fluids.

### Pathological post-obstructive diuresis following obstructive uropathy due to constipation in the post-partum period: a case report [^bd7b6f28]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Constipation is aggravated by hormonal, anatomical and lifestyle practices in pregnancy and puerperium, which can lead to debilitating sequalae. Although not essential or recommended to medically manage constipation in pregnancy and puerperium, intervention maybe necessary for more severe cases, which is to be decided on a case-by-case basis. Constipation leading to obstructive uropathy with resultant post-obstructive diuresis is not well documented in the pregnancy or puerperium. However, it is crucial to have a high index of suspicion, in a patient with postpartum obstructive uropathy for timely intervention and involvement of a multidisciplinary team in case of developing post-obstructive diuresis. Since the physiology is altered in pregnancy and has yet to return to normal adult physiology in the puerperium, it is essential to account for the altered standards for laboratory values and clinical evaluation. Therefore, postpartum women undergoing this disease progression may need earlier intervention than in other adults, which can further make the waters murkier for the diagnosis and management of these patients.

Perioperative oliguria is common but rarely implies acute renal failure. We should interpret oliguria as a sign of intravascular hypovolemia and treat it as prerenal until proven otherwise. On the other hand, the absence of oliguria does not exclude acute renal failure. The most reliable clinical indicator of progressive renal dysfunction is a serial decline in creatinine clearance estimation, a measure of glomerular filtration rate.

Understanding hypernatremia is at times difficult for many clinicians. However, hypernatremia can often be deciphered easily with some basic understanding of water and sodium balance. Here, the basic pathophysiological abnormalities underlying the development of sodium disorders are reviewed, and case examples are given. Hypernatremia often arises in the hospital, especially in the intensive care units due to the combination of (1) not being able to drink water; (2) inability to concentrate the urine (most often from having kidney failure); (3) osmotic diuresis from having high serum urea concentrations, and (4) large urine or stool outputs.

### A contemporary assessment of nocturia: definition, epidemiology, pathophysiology, and management – a systematic review and meta-analysis [^fec509ff]. European Urology (2012). Low credibility.

Context

Nocturia is a common urologic symptom that has been covered in a variety of reported studies in the literature but is not specifically covered in current guidelines.

Objective

To comprehensively review the literature pertaining to the definition, etiologies, and consequences of nocturia and assess the evidence supporting the use of conservative medical and interventional therapy.

Evidence Acquisition

A literature search was conducted using the keyword nocturia, restricted to articles in the English language, after 2000 and before April 2012, in PubMed/Medline, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library databases. Regarding treatment modalities, studies were included only if nocturia was a primary end point and if the studies were designed as randomized controlled trials without limit of date. When suitable, a meta-analysis was conducted. Papers covering treatment options for nocturia specifically related to nonurologic conditions were excluded.

Evidence Synthesis

Nocturia is still defined as the symptom of wakening from sleep once or more often to void. The prevalence is high in both genders and increases with age. Frequency-volume charts, which are the pivotal tool of clinical assessment, detect 24-h polyuria, nocturnal polyuria (NP), or reduced nocturnal bladder capacity and help to target specific nonurologic etiologies. Nocturia is a morbid condition that significantly affects quality of life and increases mortality. Besides behavioral measures, validated treatment options include oral desmopressin, which is superior to placebo in treating NP. While the level of evidence for desmopressin is high, limited data support the use of α1-blockers and antimuscarinics; however, only rarely has nocturia been a primary end point when studying these drug classes, and studies have not consistently controlled for the effect of NP.

Conclusions

Our knowledge of nocturia, its etiology, and its management has substantially improved in recent years. The evidence available on the management of nocturia remains limited; contributory factors include (1) the complexity of associated conditions, (2) the underuse of objective evaluation tools, and (3) the lack of specific focus on nocturia in clinical trials.

### Desmopressin for treating nocturia in men [^d0b47ecf]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Nocturia is the bothersome symptom of awakening one or more times per night to void. Desmopressin is a commonly used medication for treating nocturia.

Objectives

To assess the effects of desmopressin as compared to other interventions in the treatment of nocturia in men.

Search Methods

We performed a comprehensive search of medical literature with no restrictions on the language of publication or publication status. The date of the latest search of all databases was August 2017.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized or quasi-randomized trials. Inclusion criteria were men with nocturia defined as one or more voids per night. Trials of children, adults with primary or secondary enuresis or underlying distinct disorders were excluded.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently classified studies and abstracted data from the included studies. We performed statistical analyses using a random-effects model and interpreted data according to the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions.

Main Results

We included 14 studies with 2966 randomized men across five comparisons. Desmopressin versus placebo: based on short-term follow-up (up to three months), desmopressin may have a similar effect on the number of nocturnal voids (mean difference (MD) -0.46, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.94 to 0.01; low-quality evidence). We are uncertain about the effect of desmopressin on major adverse events at short-term follow-up (risk ratio (RR) 0.97, 95% CI 0.10 to 9.03; very low-quality evidence). For intermediate-term follow-up (three to 12 months), desmopressin may reduce the number of nocturnal voids in an appreciable number of participants (MD -0.85, 95% CI -1.17 to -0.53; low-quality evidence). Desmopressin may result in little or no difference in major adverse events at intermediate-term follow-up (RR 3.05, 95% CI 0.13 to 73.39; low-quality evidence). We found no evidence on quality of life. Subgroup analyses suggest a larger effect with oral, higher-dose formulations of desmopressin and in men with documented nocturnal polyuria. Desmopressin versus behavior modification: there were no data regarding the effect on the number of nocturnal voids, quality of life, or major adverse events. Desmopressin versus alpha-blocker: based on short-term follow-up, desmopressin likely has a similar effect on the number of nocturnal voids (MD 0.30, 95% CI -0.20 to 0.80; moderate-quality evidence) and quality of life (MD 0.00, 95% CI -0.35 to 0.35; moderate-quality evidence). There were no major adverse events in either study group. Desmopressin plus alpha-blocker versus alpha-blocker alone: based on short-term follow-up, combination therapy likely results in a small, unimportant reduction in the number of nocturnal voids (MD -0.47, 95% CI -0.73 to -0.21; moderate-quality evidence) and quality of life (MD -0.29, 95% CI -0.51 to -0.07; moderate-quality evidence). The risk of major adverse events may be similar (RR 0.30, 95% CI 0.01 to 7.32; low-quality evidence). Desmopressin plus alpha-blocker versus alpha-blocker plus an anticholinergic: based on short-term follow-up, combination therapy likely results in little or no difference in the number of nocturnal voids (MD -0.43, 95% CI -0.97 to 0.11; moderate-quality evidence). We found no evidence on quality of life. There were no major adverse events in either study group.

Authors' Conclusions

Desmopressin may reduce the number of nocturnal voids in an appreciable number of participants compared to placebo in intermediate-term (three to 12 months) follow-up without increase in major adverse events. We found no evidence to compare its effects to behavior modification. The effect on the number of nocturnal voids is likely similar to that of alpha-blockers short-term with very infrequent major adverse events. There appears to be no added benefit in the combined use of desmopressin with an alpha-blocker or an anticholinergic. The findings of this review were limited by short-term follow-up, study limitations, and imprecision.

European Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Recommendation : Urinalysis should be performed at initial evaluation and when clinically indicated at follow‐up visits for individuals with neurological diseases and urinary symptoms. (Good practice statement; Consensus: 94%).

Clinical Question 4. Should urine cultures versus no testing be offered for individuals with neurological disease and urinary symptoms?

Quantitative urine culture is used to diagnose a UTI by testing for the type of organisms and antibiotic sensitivity, and should be performed only in patients with symptoms such as dysuria, cloudy and/or malodorous urine, lower abdominal pain, and fever.

Recommendation : A urine culture should be performed for individuals with neurological diseases reporting urinary symptoms only if there is a suspicion of a UTI. (Good practice statement; Consensus: 91%).

Clinical Question 5. Should individuals with neurological diseases reporting urinary symptoms complete a bladder diary versus not complete a bladder diary?

Recording fluid intake, ideally together with urine output, helps to corroborate the history, recognize beverages and drinking habits detrimental to urinary symptoms, and provide an assessment of the functional bladder capacity. Nocturnal polyuria and polydipsia can be diagnosed only by using a bladder diary.

Recommendation : A three‐day bladder diary should be completed by individuals with neurological diseases having urinary problems at initial evaluation and at follow‐up visits when clinically indicated to provide an objective assessment of urinary symptoms. (Good practice statement; Consensus: 94%).

Clinical Question 6. Should individuals with neurological disease reporting urinary symptoms have their post‐void residual measured vs. not have their post‐void residual measured?

Post‐void residual volume is defined as the volume of urine left in the urinary bladder at the end of micturition and is a valuable indicator of bladder emptying.

### As the river flows: a case report of post obstructive diuresis [^dd99d240]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The typical pathophysiology of PObD involves multiple mechanisms. These include a progressive reduction in medullary concentration due to washout from urinary retention and tubular injury, downregulation of sodium transport receptors in the thick ascending loop of henle, a reduction in the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) because of excess urinary retention leading to ischemic effects and damage to nephrons, and a poor response to anti-diuretic hormone (ADH) comparable to that of Nephrogenic Diabetes Insipidus (DI) [,,–]. Multiple conditions can lead to outlet obstruction of the urinary tract and induce PObD such as urinary stones, benign prostatic hyperplasia, fecal impaction, diabetes and neurogenic disorders, and/or bladder or prostate cancer as in our patient.

Although there are no concrete treatment plans for patients with PObD, there is acknowledged importance in ensuring documentation of hourly urine output and serum electrolytes every 12 h. The expectation is to replace half to two thirds of the hourly urine output to avoid increased diuresis while also ensuring adequate fluid resuscitation combined with appropriate electrolyte repletion [–,]. A urine sodium greater than 40 and a specific gravity less than 1.010 or a urine osmolality less than 450 can indicate concurrent tubular dysfunction and can also be tracked to indicate improvement in a patient’s condition [–,,].

### Calculus anuria in a spina bifida patient, who had solitary functioning kidney and recurrent renal calculi [^5812ecaf]. Spinal Cord (2004). Low credibility.

Study Design

Clinical case report with comments by colleagues from Austria, Belgium, Germany, Japan, and Poland.

Objectives

To discuss challenges in the management of spinal bifida patients, who have marked kyphoscoliosis and no vascular access.

Setting

Regional Spinal Injuries Centre, Southport, UK.

Methods

A female patient, who was born with spina bifida, paraplegia and solitary right kidney, had undergone ileal loop urinary diversion. Renal calculi were noted in 1986. Percutaneous nephrostolithotomy was performed in 1989 and there was no residual stone fragment. However, she developed recurrence of calculi in the lower pole of the right kidney in 1991. Intravenous urography, performed in 1995, revealed right staghorn calculus and hydronephrosis. Chest X-ray showed markedly restricted lung volume due to severe kyphoscoliosis. In 2000, she was declared unsuitable for anaesthesia due to a lack of venous access and a high likelihood of difficulty in weaning off the ventilator in the postoperative period. In June 2002, she developed anuria (urine output=18 ml/24 h) due to ball-valve-type obstruction by a renal stone at the ureteropelvic junction. Urea: 14.4 mmol/l; creatinine: 236 microl/l. Ultrasound showed right hydronephrosis. Percutaneous nephrostomy was performed.

Results

Following relief of urinary tract obstruction, there was postobstructive diuresis (3765 ml/24 h). However, the patient expired 19 days later due to progressive respiratory failure.

Conclusion

In this spina bifida patient, who had reached the age of 35 years, severe kyphoscoliosis and lack of vascular access presented insurmountable challenges to implement the desired surgical procedure for removal of stones from a solitary kidney.

### Pathological post-obstructive diuresis following obstructive uropathy due to constipation in the post-partum period: a case report [^0b23f76b]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2021). Medium credibility.

This is a normal physiological response adopted by the organism to remove the accumulated excess of water and solutes during the period of urinary obstruction. However, in some patients, this physiological response is prolonged past the stage of normal solute concentrations and normovolemia causing extended diuresis leading to water and electrolyte abnormalities such as severe dehydration, hyper/hyponatremia, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, metabolic acidosis and at the most extreme, hypovolemic shock and even death if not duly managed. The initial physiological post-obstructive diuresis is self-limiting and usually resolves by 24 h, whereas pathological post-obstructive diuresis lasts longer than 48 h with associated water and electrolyte imbalances, needing careful monitoring and appropriate fluid and electrolyte management.

Pathophysiology of post-obstructive diuresis is complex and can be discussed under several processes which includes, reduction of the medullary concentration gradient caused by vascular washout and downregulation of sodium transporters in thick ascending limb of loop of Henle, ischemia and loss of juxtamedullary nephrons preceded by reduced glomerular filtration rate, and nephrogenic diabetes insipidus caused by reduced response to antidiuretic hormone by the collecting duct.

These mechanisms lead to a mixed water-solute type diuresis where urine osmolality is 100-300 mmol/kg as was seen in this patient. Spot urine sodium level of more than 40 mEq/l is suggestive of renal tubular injury which, in turn, points to a more likely scenario of pathological post-obstructive diuresis. The duration of polyuria which lasted more than 48 h after relief of obstruction in this patient, is also suggestive that a pathological post-obstructive diuresis occurred while the timely management with the involvement of the nephrologist and the obstetric team stabilized patient’s condition.

Volume of urine immediately drained following relief of obstruction being more than 1500 ml may indicate that the patient would be developing post-obstructive diuresis. However, there is no clear evidence on the factors which may indicate the physiological post-obstructive diuresis developing into pathological post-obstructive diuresis. Some studies, however, point towards pre-existing renal damage, congestive heart failure and volume overload as well as dizziness and central nervous system depression to be predictors of the above development, none of which this patient exhibited. Therefore, a high index of suspicion needs to be exercised following relief of urinary tract obstruction regardless of the demographical and biological risk factors to timely intervene in post-obstructive diuresis, even in the obstetric practice.

### KDOQI US commentary on the 2012 KDIGO clinical practice guideline for acute kidney injury [^ab0f81e0]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2013). Medium credibility.

Pediatric modified RIFLE (pRIFLE) criteria in children define acute kidney injury using estimated creatinine clearance (eCCl) and urine output thresholds. Risk is “eCCl decrease by >25%” with urine output “<0.5 mL/kg/h for >8 h.” Injury is “eCCl decrease by >50%” with urine output “<0.5 mL/kg/h for >16 h.” Failure is “eCCl decrease by >75%; or eCCl <35 mL/min/1.73 m2” with urine output “<0.3 mL/kg/h for >12 h; or anuria for >12 h.” Loss is “Persistent failure for >4 wk,” and End Stage is “Persistent failure for >3 mo.” The table defines “eCCl: estimated creatinine clearance using the Schwartz formula.”

### Current management of nocturnal enuresis [^c14eb5e6]. Current Opinion in Urology (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Nocturnal enuresis is an especially common problem with the potential to have an appreciable negative impact on the emotional health of a child.

Recent Findings

Our understanding of the pathogenesis continues to improve. A disorder of sleep arousal, a low nocturnal bladder capacity, and nocturnal polyuria are the three factors that interrelate to cause nocturnal enuresis. Constipation is a very common and often unrecognized factor that appreciably affects bladder function.

Summary

Successful treatment involves interventions that simultaneously improve these factors. Self-esteem improves with any form of therapy and dryness is possible for the majority of children.

### Clinical management of SIADH [^9c2d486a]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2012). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia is the most frequent electrolyte disorder and the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) accounts for approximately one-third of all cases. In the diagnosis of SIADH it is important to ascertain the euvolemic state of extracellular fluid volume, both clinically and by laboratory measurements. SIADH should be treated to cure symptoms. While this is undisputed in the presence of grave or advanced symptoms, the clinical role and the indications for treatment in the presence of mild to moderate symptoms are currently unclear. Therapeutic modalities include nonspecific measures and means (fluid restriction, hypertonic saline, urea, demeclocycline), with fluid restriction and hypertonic saline commonly used. Recently vasopressin receptor antagonists, called vaptans, have been introduced as specific and direct therapy of SIADH. Although clinical experience with vaptans is limited at this time, they appear advantageous to patients because there is no need for fluid restriction and the correction of hyponatremia can be achieved comfortably and within a short time. Vaptans also appear to be beneficial for physicians and staff because of their efficiency and reliability. The side effects are thirst, polydipsia and frequency of urination. In any therapy of chronic SIADH it is important to limit the daily increase of serum sodium to less than 8-10 mmol/liter because higher correction rates have been associated with osmotic demyelination. In the case of vaptan treatment, the first 24 h are critical for prevention of an overly rapid correction of hyponatremia and the serum sodium should be measured after 0, 6, 24 and 48 h of treatment. Discontinuation of any vaptan therapy for longer than 5 or 6 days should be monitored to prevent hyponatremic relapse. It may be necessary to taper the vaptan dose or restrict fluid intake or both.

### Improving management of hyponatraemia by increasing urine testing in the emergency department [^5bce9c81]. BMJ Open Quality (2023). High credibility.

Problem

Hyponatraemia, as defined by serum sodium <135 mmol/L, is present in up to 10% of patients admitted to the hospital and is associated with increased length of stay (LOS), healthcare costs and mortality.Elderly patients represent a high-risk group for the occurrence of hyponatraemia, with both age and polypharmacy being independently associated with hyponatraemia.In this population, the incidence of hyponatraemia has been reported to be as high as 34% on admission in hospitalised patients over 65 years old.Furthermore, studies also indicate that symptomatic manifestations of hyponatraemia are more common and more severe in elderly patients, with hyponatraemia independently associated with increased mortality.Urine studies obtained before fluids or diuretics are administered, both of which rapidly alter the composition of urine, are essential in the workup of hyponatraemia aetiology. Despite their clinical utility, urine studies are not frequently obtained in emergency department (ED) patients before fluid or diuretic administration for a variety of reasons. These include patients not being asked to provide a urine specimen during triage and a desire to provide rapid interventions to improve a patient’s clinical status, for example, intravenous fluids in a patient who is clinically dehydrated or intravenous diuretics in a patient who is clinically volume overloaded. A baseline audit of urine collection before fluid or diuretic administration in our ED demonstrated a 34% collection rate among patients presenting with moderate-to-severe hyponatraemia, defined as serum sodium <130 mmol/L.

The participating institution is a medium-sized, 304-bed academic, tertiary care hospital that provides 35 different adult medical and surgical specialties. The facility has a 40-bed ED that serves local and regional patients, many of whom already receive subspecialty outpatient services, including oncology, transplant and neurology care. Hyponatraemia is a frequent diagnosis encountered in patients admitted to internal medicine services, and the elucidation of hyponatraemia aetiology is a frequent challenge faced by these medical teams. Given that urine sodium and osmolality measurements are cornerstone labs in the workup of hyponatraemia aetiology,an increased rate of collection of urine samples in the ED before diuretics or intravenous fluids are administered would be helpful for the care of these patients. Therefore, in this quality improvement (QI) project, we aimed to increase the rate of urine collection before fluid or diuretic administration in patients presenting with moderate-to-severe hyponatraemia to the ED by 25%, from a baseline of 34.5% to 42.5%, during the period July 2020 through June 2021.

### Targeting urine output and 30-day mortality in goal-directed therapy: a systematic review with meta-analysis and meta-regression [^9b8d4566]. BMC Anesthesiology (2017). Low credibility.

This meta-analysis supports the hypothesis that oliguria is likely an epiphenomenon rather than a modifiable risk factor. In a perioperative setting, low urine output is common in the first 24 h after surgery and in the absence of other issues it does not reliably reflect fluid status. Moreover, urine output is influenced by factors other than the hemodynamic status. Surgical trauma and physical stress in critical illness cause the release of neuro-hormonal factors which influence glomerular filtration pressure or water reabsorption in the collecting duct, such as catecholamines, arginine vasopressin and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. While these neuro-hormonal factors are also upregulated in hypovolemia resulting in oliguria, the perioperative or critical care setting itself does promote the occurrence of oliguria. Additionally, anesthetic techniques and medication can affect neuro-hormonal factors as well as vasomotor tone. Moreover, using urine output to guide fluid management is inherently flawed due to the delayed response. Evaluating the urinary response to a fluid challenge is generally possible after at least 15-30 min, and is limited by the lack of a clear dose-response relationship. In contrast, hemodynamic parameters such as cardiac output are dynamic variables which are influenced within a short interval after a fluid challenge is given and for most variables a dose-response relationship has been given. Thus, the primary cause of oliguria may not be affected by fluid administration, or may already have been resolved by acting on another target.

In light of this, the use of permissive oliguria has already been advocated in ERAS protocols, primarily to avoid excess fluid loading. In patients managed by hemodynamic targets with a better correlation to fluid status, the occurrence of oliguria due to hemodynamic causes is unlikely, which favors the exclusion of urine output as a target for fluid resuscitation. Considering this, the current paradigm that urine output reflects renal injury and – perhaps indirectly – increases mortality needs to be revisited. In most – if not all – cases, oliguria is most likely an epiphenomenon of an underlying problem. A recent study showed that after adjusting for confounders while intraoperative urine output was not associated with postoperative morbidity, total intraoperative fluid intake and postoperative fluid boluses for hypotension and low urine output were associated with an increase in postoperative morbidity. This strongly suggests that urine output should not be a target in a fluid management protocol to improve outcome.

### A European renal best practice (ERBP) position statement on the kidney disease improving global outcomes (KDIGO) clinical practice guidelines on acute kidney injury: part 1: definitions, conservative management and contrast-induced nephropathy [^383fa0aa]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2012). Low credibility.

Rationale

Patients at increased risk for AKI and particularly those with manifest AKI require careful monitoring of their haemodynamic status, in order to balance the risk of renal hypoperfusion on the one hand and fluid overload on the other. Cardiac output and blood pressure should be kept within optimal limits to ensure the best possible kidney perfusion. However, as recently reported, hazardous fluid overload must be avoided, particularly in anuric patients with AKI. Available therapies to manage hypotension should integrate fluid and vasopressor therapy in protocols with appropriate haemodynamic goals. When volume resuscitation is deemed necessary, there is sufficient evidence to support the recommendation that there is no additional advantage of (more expensive) colloid over crystalloid solutions; therefore ERBP upgraded the strength of this recommendation. However, ERBP wants to stress that this rule does not apply in patients in whom a decrease in the circulating volume is present, e.g. in haemorrhagic shock. In these conditions, the use of colloids can be warranted; iso-osmolar solutions, with low molecular branching coefficients should be preferred. ERBP also wants to point out that the use of large quantities of isotonic saline can potentially lead to metabolic acidosis.

As renal perfusion pressure is more important than renal blood flow per se, and as the action of vasopressors is immediate and directly reversible, ERBP recommends using vasopressor therapy rather than extra fluid in volume-resuscitated patients. Here, norepinephrine has advantages over dopamine, because of fewer side-effects and lower costs, but vasopressin may be used as an alternative. Several meta-analyses have pointed out that dopamine failed to improve outcomes in patients with AKI. Finally, protocol-based goal-directed therapy is advocated in the early hours of sepsis. Such goal-directed therapy includes avoiding hypotension, optimizing oxygen delivery and careful fluid and vasopressor management when indicated. Some clinical studies have highlighted the need to keep mean arterial blood pressure above 65 mmHg in critically ill patients, but the speed of intervention seems to be very important as well.

### Targeting urine output and 30-day mortality in goal-directed therapy: a systematic review with meta-analysis and meta-regression [^8a118cfc]. BMC Anesthesiology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Textbooks and guidelines frequently recommend urine output as a parameter to guide fluid administration, since decreased organ perfusion may decrease urine output in an attempt to maintain intravascular volume. However, a suboptimal hemodynamic status is not always the cause of oliguria. In recent years, the concept of an association between intraoperative urine output and postoperative acute kidney injury has been challenged. As a result, advocacy for permissive oliguria has increased, for example to include permissive oliguria in the early recovery after surgery (ERAS) protocols.

Our group has previously published meta-analyses concerning the effects of targeting urine output on acute renal failure or acute kidney injury. A frequent remark on these meta-analyses was that while targeting urine output may not have an effect on preventing acute kidney injury, there is increasing evidence that reduced urine output is a risk factor for mortality. Especially in critically ill patients, the occurrence and severity of oliguria is associated with an increase in mortality. Whether the association between urine output and outcome is due to a causal relation or rather an epiphenomenon is yet to be determined. Nevertheless, fluids and vasoactive medication are often administered to patients with a decrease in urine output to guarantee and maintain adequate perfusion. However, whether urine output is a useful target for fluid management remains doubtful, especially when direct measures related to cardiac output and oxygen delivery are available.

We hypothesize that including urine output as a target does not decrease 30-day mortality in perioperative and critical care. This study aims to investigate whether including urine output as a target in fluid management protocols reduces 30-day mortality in perioperative and critical care.

AKI Diagnosis and Staging According to UO

According to the KDIGO criteria, AKI was defined, on an hourly basis, as a 6-hour mean of less than 0.5 mL/kg/h. An AKI of stage 1 was defined as a 6-hour mean of less than 0.5 mL/kg/h, stage 2, as a 12-hour mean of less than 0.5 mL/kg/h; and stage 3, as a 24-hour mean of less than 0.3 mL/kg/h or a 12-hour mean equal to 0 mL/kg/h (anuria). As implied by such definitions, AKI stage 2 or 3 could not have been diagnosed using UO criteria before 12 hours of ICU stay.

Overall AKI Diagnosis and Group Allocation

An AKI stage was attributed to each patient for every single hour of the ICU stay based on (1) sCr criteria, (2) UO criteria, and (3) the highest among sCr and UO criteria (overall stage). For diagnosis and classification, we considered the highest AKI stage reached by a patient using sCr criteria (sCr stage), UO criteria (UO stage), and overall (overall stage) at any time within the ICU stay. Finally, patients were classified into 1 of the following categories: no AKI if they never fulfilled any AKI criteria; sCr plus UO if they fulfilled both criteria; UO only if they fulfilled UO but not sCr criteria; or sCr only if they fulfilled sCr but not UO criteria.

Missing Values Management

For missing sCr values, we attributed values calculated by linear approximation between the previous and the next measures available. When only 1 value was available, a similar value was attributed to the previous day or the next day. For missing UO values, we attributed values calculated by dividing the next available value by the number of adjacent missing values (eg, the sequence missing, missing, missing, 200 was replaced with 50, 50, 50, 50), assuming the sequence corresponded to consolidated data entry.

Missing values at the end of the ICU stay were not considered. An hourly UO value greater than 1000 mL that remained after processing of missing values was considered erroneous and replaced by the closest hourly UO value available. The number of missing and attributed values are reported below.

### Acute kidney injury: a guide to diagnosis and management-AAFP (...) [^282ee7e5]. AAFP (2012). Low credibility.

15 Patients can also present with oliguria, anuria, or normal volumes of urine. Other presentations of acute kidney injury may include development of uremic encephalopathy, anemia, or bleeding caused by uremic platelet dysfunction. Diagnosis A patient history and physical examination, with an emphasis on assessing the patient’s volume status, are crucial for determining the cause of acute kidney injury. URINE ELECTROLYTES In patients with oliguria, measurement of FE Na is helpful in distinguishing prerenal from intrinsic renal causes of acute kidney injury. FE Na is defined by the following formula: Online calculators are also available.

A value less than 1 percent indicates a prerenal cause of acute kidney injury, whereas a value greater than 2 percent indicates an intrinsic renal cause. In patients on diuretic therapy, however, a FE. Na higher than 1 percent may be caused by natriuresis induced by the diuretic, and is a less reliable measure of a prerenal state. In such cases, fractional excretion of urea may be helpful, with values less than 35 percent indicating a prerenal cause. FE Na values less than 1 percent are not specific for prerenal causes of acute kidney injury because these values can occur in other conditions, such as contrast nephropathy, rhabdomyolysis, acute glomerulonephritis, and urinary tract obstruction. 17, 18 The presence of postvoid residual urine greater than 100 mL suggests postrenal acute kidney injury and requires renal ultrasonography to detect hydronephrosis or outlet obstruction.

To diagnose extrarenal causes of obstruction, other imaging modalities, such as computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging, may be required. The main indication for use of diuretics is management of volume overload. Intravenous loop diuretics, as a bolus or continuous infusion, can be helpful for this purpose. However, it is important to note that diuretics do not improve morbidity, mortality, or renal outcomes, and should not be used to prevent or treat acute kidney injury in the absence of volume overload.

### KDIGO clinical practice guidelines for acute kidney injury [^807beabc]. Nephron: Clinical Practice (2012). Medium credibility.

KDIGO acute kidney injury (AKI)—urine output criteria and clinical judgment emphasize that the use of urine output criteria for diagnosis and staging has been less well validated and in individual patients the need for clinical judgment regarding the effects of drugs (e.g., angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors [ACE-I]), fluid balance, and other factors must be included; for very obese patients, urine output criteria for AKI may include some patients with normal urine output. It is recognized that it is frequently not possible to determine the cause, and often the exact cause does not dictate a specific therapy; however, the syndrome of AKI includes some patients with specific kidney diseases (e.g., glomerulonephritis) for which a specific treatment is available. As such, it is always necessary to search for the underlying cause of AKI.
