## Question

The common cold in children treatment

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the treatment of the common cold in children. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and natural history to set expectations. Then, I should verify which pediatric interventions have supportive evidence versus those with insufficient or harmful evidence. Next, I will review safety constraints by age, especially for infants and young children. After that, I should synthesize practical, symptom-targeted recommendations and counseling points. Finally, I will identify evidence gaps and outline a follow-up plan with red flags that warrant reassessment.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and natural history so I don't jump to conclusions. The common cold in children is a self-limited viral upper respiratory infection with typical symptoms including nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, cough, sore throat, and malaise, and most children experience multiple episodes per year, with symptoms often resolving within 10 to 15 days, though cough can persist longer in some cases, which I should explicitly counsel families about to reduce anxiety and unnecessary visits [^06539264] [^a278cecb].

> Wait, let me verify the overarching principle before recommending anything. Antibiotics are not effective for the common cold and should be avoided unless there is a clear bacterial complication, and routine use of over-the-counter cough and cold medications in young children is discouraged due to lack of proven benefit and potential harm, so supportive care remains the foundation of management in pediatrics [^8330f6f3] [^3220cad3].

> I will now examine evidence-supported symptomatic therapies, starting with cough. Honey has the most consistent pediatric signal for reducing cough frequency and severity in children aged 1 year and older, with guideline endorsements from AAFP and CHEST, and I should confirm the age restriction to avoid infant botulism risk. The comparative data suggest honey may outperform no treatment and diphenhydramine but is not clearly superior to dextromethorphan, and dextromethorphan should be avoided under age 2 years, so I need to ensure I communicate those caveats clearly [^38819be7] [^d1c1c299] [^efa95144].

> Next, I should review nasal symptoms. Saline nasal irrigation is reasonable and may reduce nasal secretions and obstruction in children aged 1 year and older, with low-certainty but supportive evidence and favorable safety, so I can recommend it as an adjunct, while reminding caregivers about proper technique and tolerability, especially in younger children [^4e91ec9a] [^727978fa].

> Hold on, I should verify the role of topical menthol rubs. A menthol-containing ointment such as Vicks VapoRub may improve nocturnal cough and sleep quality in children aged 2 years and older, though the evidence is limited and parental perception is susceptible to scent-related unblinding; I should frame this as optional, age-appropriate, and not for infants due to potential mucosal irritation and aspiration risk, and I should double-check that the AAFP endorsement applies to children 1 year and older before I overstate it [^c2d68a8d] [^d8af7362].

> Let me consider mucolytics. Acetylcysteine has some pediatric evidence suggesting benefit for cough, but availability varies and the certainty is low, so I should present it as a conditional option when accessible and appropriate, and I need to ensure I don't overpromise efficacy given the limited high-quality data in children [^9c9f98f1].

> I should confirm the status of intranasal ipratropium. For bothersome rhinorrhea in children aged 5 years and older, intranasal ipratropium 0.06% can be used short term, with pediatric safety data supporting use for 2 to 4 days in common colds; I need to emphasize that efficacy is modest and limited to rhinorrhea, and that use in children under 5 years is not established [^3989927e] [^df1563c2].

> Now, I need to check which commonly used therapies lack sufficient pediatric evidence or carry safety concerns. Zinc lozenges have inconsistent results in adults and no definitive pediatric recommendation, with taste disturbance and rare anosmia risks, so I should not routinely recommend zinc for treatment in children. Likewise, echinacea has not shown consistent benefit in treatment trials. And codeine is contraindicated for pediatric cough due to respiratory depression risk, so I must explicitly advise against it [^5369eb4f] [^4d326b19] [^c062c8af] [^547d765c].

> But wait, what about decongestants and antihistamines. I initially thought topical decongestants might help nasal obstruction in children, but I should double-check the pediatric data. The Cochrane reviews and guidelines indicate insufficient evidence for routine use of nasal decongestants in children, with potential adverse effects, and oral decongestants are not recommended under 12 years, so I should correct my initial inclination and advise against decongestants in young children, reserving any consideration for older children only if benefits clearly outweigh risks and after shared decision-making [^1f156404] [^643943fc].

> Next, I should review age-specific safety constraints so I don't miss a critical restriction. For infants under 1 year, honey is contraindicated due to botulism risk, and for children under 2 years, dextromethorphan should be avoided. Across all pediatric ages, codeine-containing medications are contraindicated for cough, and OTC cough and cold combination products should not be used in children under 4 years, with many authorities extending caution to under 6 years, so I need to ensure my counseling aligns with these thresholds [^d1c1c299] [^18de641b] [^8330f6f3] [^643943fc].

> I will now synthesize practical, symptom-targeted recommendations. For cough in children aged 1 year and older, consider honey, especially at night, and consider menthol rub in children aged 2 years and older. For nasal congestion and rhinorrhea, use saline irrigation in children aged 1 year and older, and consider intranasal ipratropium for persistent watery rhinorrhea in children aged 5 years and older. For fever and discomfort, use weight-appropriate acetaminophen or ibuprofen. Throughout, reinforce hydration, rest, and hand hygiene to reduce transmission, and avoid antibiotics and OTC cough and cold combinations in young children [^38819be7] [^c2d68a8d] [^4e91ec9a] [^3989927e] [^8330f6f3].

> Hold on, I should verify that I am not overlooking any red flags that would change management. Persistent fever beyond 3 to 4 days, respiratory distress, lethargy, poor intake, ear pain, or symptoms worsening after initial improvement should prompt reassessment for complications such as otitis media, pneumonia, or asthma exacerbation, and I should communicate these warning signs clearly to caregivers during the initial visit [^notfound].

> Let me reconsider the strength of evidence and be transparent about uncertainties. Many pediatric cold interventions have low to very low certainty evidence, so shared decision-making is essential, and I should document that I have discussed the limited benefits, potential harms, and the self-limited nature of the illness, while also noting that ongoing research may refine recommendations in the future [^7fe57ce2] [^59b366d3].

> Finally, I should confirm a follow-up plan. Most children improve within 10 to 15 days, so routine follow-up is not necessary if improving, but I will offer a safety-net return visit if symptoms persist beyond two weeks, worsen at any time, or if new concerning features develop, and I will provide written instructions to reinforce age-appropriate therapies and avoidance of contraindicated medications [^06539264].

For children with the common cold, **supportive care is first-line** [^9c9f98f1] and includes hydration, rest, and age-appropriate acetaminophen or ibuprofen for fever or discomfort [^notfound]. Honey is effective for **cough relief in children older than 1 year** [^38819be7] [^d1c1c299], while saline nasal irrigation can ease congestion [^4e91ec9a] [^727978fa]. Avoid **OTC cough and cold medications** in children under 4 years due to limited benefit and potential harm [^8330f6f3] [^3220cad3]; do not use codeine or aspirin [^547d765c] [^notfound]. Antibiotics are not indicated unless bacterial infection is suspected [^a064477c]. Educate families on the typical 7–10 day course and red flags that warrant reassessment [^06539264].

---

## Supportive care

Supportive care remains the cornerstone of management for pediatric colds:

- **Hydration**: Encourage adequate fluid intake to maintain hydration [^notfound].

- **Rest**: Ensure sufficient rest to support recovery [^notfound].

- **Fever management**: Use acetaminophen or ibuprofen for fever or discomfort, dosing by weight and age [^notfound].

---

## Pharmacologic interventions

### Analgesics and antipyretics

Acetaminophen and ibuprofen are recommended for **fever and discomfort** [^notfound]; ibuprofen is not recommended for children under 6 months.

---

### Cough management

- **Honey**: For children older than 1 year, honey is effective for cough relief and is superior to no treatment, diphenhydramine, or placebo, but not better than dextromethorphan [^38819be7] [^d1c1c299] [^8d8b5d3a].

- **Dextromethorphan**: Not recommended for children under 2 years due to lack of efficacy and potential adverse effects [^d1c1c299].

- **Codeine**: Contraindicated in children under 18 years due to risk of respiratory depression [^547d765c] [^511f6491].

---

### Nasal congestion management

Saline nasal irrigation is recommended for children aged **≥ 1 year** to relieve nasal congestion and improve breathing [^4e91ec9a] [^727978fa]. Intranasal ipratropium may be considered for persistent rhinorrhea in children aged **≥ 5 years** [^3989927e] [^df1563c2].

---

### Over-the-counter (OTC) cough and cold medications

OTC cough and cold medications are **not recommended for children under 4 years** due to limited efficacy and potential adverse effects, including overdose and toxicity [^8330f6f3] [^3220cad3]. For children aged 4–6 years, use only if clearly indicated and with caution; for those older than 6 years, consider only if benefits outweigh risks [^notfound].

---

## Non-pharmacologic interventions

- **Humidified air**: May provide symptomatic relief, though evidence is limited and mixed [^d1be0184].

- **Menthol rubs**: Topical menthol-containing ointments may relieve nocturnal cough in children aged ≥ 2 years [^c2d68a8d] [^d8af7362].

---

## Preventive measures

Hand hygiene is the most effective strategy to **reduce transmission** of cold viruses [^643943fc]. Probiotics may modestly reduce the incidence of upper respiratory infections, but evidence is limited and inconsistent [^ffc263e3].

---

## When to seek medical attention

Parents should seek medical evaluation if any of the following occur:

- **Respiratory distress**: Difficulty breathing, rapid breathing, or wheezing.

- **Persistent fever**: Fever lasting more than 3 days or temperature ≥ 40°C (104°F).

- **Lethargy or irritability**: Excessive sleepiness, difficulty waking, or persistent irritability.

- **Poor intake**: Signs of dehydration (dry mouth, decreased urine output).

- **Ear pain**: Suggestive of otitis media.

- **Symptom persistence**: Cough or congestion lasting more than 10 days without improvement.

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Intervention** | **Recommendation** | **Age group** |
|-|-|-|
| Acetaminophen/Ibuprofen | Recommended for fever/discomfort | ≥ 6 months |
| Honey | Recommended for cough | ≥ 1 year |
| Saline nasal irrigation | Recommended for congestion | ≥ 1 year |
| Intranasal ipratropium | Consider for rhinorrhea | ≥ 5 years |
| OTC cough/cold meds | Not recommended | < 4 years |
| Codeine | Contraindicated | < 18 years |
| Antibiotics | Not indicated unless bacterial infection suspected | All ages |

---

Supportive care is the foundation of pediatric cold management, with **limited roles for pharmacologic therapy**. Honey and saline irrigation are the most evidence-based options; avoid OTC cough and cold medications in young children and use caution in older children.

### Pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatment for acute cough associated with the common cold: CHEST expert panel report [^9d6123d4]. Chest (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Acute cough associated with the common cold (CACC) causes significant impairment in quality of life. Effective treatment approaches are needed for CACC. We conducted a systematic review on the management of CACC to update the recommendations and suggestions of the CHEST 2006 guideline on this topic.

Methods

This systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) asked the question: Is there evidence of clinically relevant treatment effects for pharmacologic or nonpharmacologic therapies in reducing the duration/severity of acute CACC? Studies of adults and pediatric patients with CACC were included and assessed for relevance and quality. Based on the systematic review, guideline suggestions were developed and voted on using the American College of Chest Physicians organization methodology.

Results

Six systematic reviews and four primary studies identified from updated literature searches for each of the reviews or from hand searching were included and reported data on 6,496 participants with CACC who received one or more of a variety of interventions. The studies used an assortment of descriptors and assessments to identify CACC.

Conclusions

The evidence supporting the management of CACC is overall of low quality. This document provides treatment suggestions based on the best currently available evidence and identifies gaps in our knowledge and areas for future research.

### Antihistamines for the common cold [^1e112a0c]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The common cold is an upper respiratory tract infection, most commonly caused by a rhinovirus. It affects people of all age groups and although in most cases it is self limiting, the common cold still causes significant morbidity. Antihistamines are commonly offered over the counter to relieve symptoms for patients affected by the common cold, however there is not much evidence of their efficacy.

Objectives

To assess the effects of antihistamines on the common cold.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL (2015, Issue 6), MEDLINE (1948 to July week 4, 2015), EMBASE (2010 to August 2015), CINAHL (1981 to August 2015), LILACS (1982 to August 2015) and Biosis Previews (1985 to August 2015).

Selection Criteria

We selected randomised controlled trials (RCTs) using antihistamines as monotherapy for the common cold. We excluded any studies with combination therapy or using antihistamines in patients with an allergic component in their illness.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. We collected adverse effects information from the included trials.

Main Results

We included 18 RCTs, which were reported in 17 publications (one publication reports on two trials) with 4342 participants (of which 212 were children) suffering from the common cold, both naturally occurring and experimentally induced. The interventions consisted of an antihistamine as monotherapy compared with placebo. In adults there was a short-term beneficial effect of antihistamines on severity of overall symptoms: on day one or two of treatment 45% had a beneficial effect with antihistamines versus 38% with placebo (odds ratio (OR) 0.74, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.60 to 0.92). However, there was no difference between antihistamines and placebo in the mid term (three to four days) to long term (six to 10 days). When evaluating individual symptoms such as nasal congestion, rhinorrhoea and sneezing, there was some beneficial effect of the sedating antihistamines compared to placebo (e.g. rhinorrhoea on day three: mean difference (MD) -0.23, 95% CI -0.39 to -0.06 on a four- or five-point severity scale; sneezing on day three: MD -0.35, 95% CI -0.49 to -0.20 on a four-point severity scale), but this effect is clinically non-significant. Adverse events such as sedation were more commonly reported with sedating antihistamines although the differences were not statistically significant. Only two trials included children and the results were conflicting. The majority of the trials had a low risk of bias although some lacked sufficient trial quality information.

Authors' Conclusions

Antihistamines have a limited short-term (days one and two of treatment) beneficial effect on severity of overall symptoms but not in the mid to long term. There is no clinically significant effect on nasal obstruction, rhinorrhoea or sneezing. Although side effects are more common with sedating antihistamines, the difference is not statistically significant. There is no evidence of effectiveness of antihistamines in children.

### Zinc for prevention and treatment of the common cold [^4d326b19]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The common cold is an acute, self-limiting viral respiratory illness. Symptoms include nasal congestion and mucus discharge, sneezing, sore throat, cough, and general malaise. Given the frequency of colds, they are a public health burden and a significant cause of lost work productivity and school absenteeism. There are no established interventions to prevent colds or shorten their duration. However, zinc supplements are commonly recommended and taken for this purpose.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness and safety of zinc for the prevention and treatment of the common cold.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and LILACS to 22 May 2023, and searched Web of Science Core Collection and two trials registries to 14 June 2023. We also used reference checking, citation searching, and contact with study authors to identify additional studies.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in children or adults that tested any form of zinc against placebo to prevent or treat the common cold or upper respiratory infection (URTI). We excluded zinc interventions in which zinc was combined with other minerals, vitamins, or herbs (e.g. a multivitamin, or mineral supplement containing zinc).

Data Collection and Analysis

We used the Cochrane risk of bias tool to assess risks of bias, and GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence. We independently extracted data. When necessary, we contacted study authors for additional information. We assessed zinc (type and route) with placebo in the prevention and treatment of the common cold. Primary outcomes included the proportion of participants developing colds (for analyses of prevention trials only), duration of cold (measured in days from start to resolution of the cold), adverse events potentially due to zinc supplements (e.g. unpleasant taste, loss of smell, vomiting, stomach cramps, and diarrhoea), and adverse events considered to be potential complications of the common cold (e.g. respiratory bacterial infections).

Main Results

We included 34 studies (15 prevention, 19 treatment) involving 8526 participants. Twenty-two studies were conducted on adults and 12 studies were conducted on children. Most trials were conducted in the USA (n = 18), followed by India, Indonesia, Iran, and Turkey (two studies each), and Australia, Burkina Faso, Colombia, Denmark, Finland, Tanzania, Thailand, and the UK (one study each). The 15 prevention studies identified the condition as either common cold (n = 8) or URTI (n = 7). However, almost all therapeutic studies (17/19) focused on the common cold. Most studies (17/34) evaluated the effectiveness of zinc administered as lozenges (3 prevention; 14 treatment) in acetate, gluconate, and orotate forms; gluconate lozenges were the most common (9/17). Zinc gluconate was given at doses between 45 and 276 mg/day for between 4.5 and 21 days. Five (5/17) lozenge studies gave acetate lozenges and two (2/17) gave both acetate and gluconate lozenges. One (1/17) lozenge study administered intranasal (gluconate) and lozenge (orotate) zinc in tandem for cold treatment. Of the 17/34 studies that did not use lozenges, 1/17 gave capsules, 3/17 administered dissolved powders, 5/17 gave tablets, 4/17 used syrups, and 4/17 used intranasal administration. Most studies were at unclear or high risk of bias in at least one domain. There may be little or no reduction in the risk of developing a cold with zinc compared to placebo (risk ratio (RR) 0.93, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.01; I² = 20%; 9 studies, 1449 participants; low-certainty evidence). There may be little or no reduction in the mean number of colds that occur over five to 18 months of follow-up (mean difference (MD) -0.90, 95% CI -1.93 to 0.12; I² = 96%; 2 studies, 1284 participants; low-certainty evidence). When colds occur, there is probably little or no difference in the duration of colds in days (MD -0.63, 95% CI -1.29 to 0.04; I² = 77%; 3 studies, 740 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), and there may be little or no difference in global symptom severity (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.04, 95% CI -0.35 to 0.43; I² = 0%; 2 studies, 101 participants; low-certainty evidence). When zinc is used for cold treatment, there may be a reduction in the mean duration of the cold in days (MD -2.37, 95% CI -4.21 to -0.53; I² = 97%; 8 studies, 972 participants; low-certainty evidence), although it is uncertain whether there is a reduction in the risk of having an ongoing cold at the end of follow-up (RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.21 to 1.27; I² = 65%; 5 studies, 357 participants; very low-certainty evidence), or global symptom severity (SMD -0.03, 95% CI -0.56 to 0.50; I² = 78%; 2 studies, 261 participants; very low-certainty evidence), and there may be little or no difference in the risk of a change in global symptom severity (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.23; 1 study, 114 participants; low-certainty evidence). Thirty-one studies reported non-serious adverse events (2422 participants). It is uncertain whether there is a difference in the risk of adverse events with zinc used for cold prevention (RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.47; I² = 0%; 7 studies, 1517 participants; very low-certainty evidence) or an increase in the risk of serious adverse events (RR 1.67, 95% CI 0.78 to 3.57; I² = 0%; 3 studies, 1563 participants; low-certainty evidence). There is probably an increase in the risk of non-serious adverse events when zinc is used for cold treatment (RR 1.34, 95% CI 1.15 to 1.55; I² = 44%; 2084 participants, 16 studies; moderate-certainty evidence); no treatment study provided information on serious adverse events. No study provided clear information about adverse events considered to be potential complications of the common cold.

Authors' Conclusions

The findings suggest that zinc supplementation may have little or no effect on the prevention of colds but may reduce the duration of ongoing colds, with an increase in non-serious adverse events. Overall, there was wide variation in interventions (including concomitant therapy) and outcomes across the studies, as well as incomplete reporting of several domains, which should be considered when making conclusions about the efficacy of zinc for the common cold.

### Treatment of the common cold [^8330f6f3]. American Family Physician (2019). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for common cold, more specifically with respect to cold medications, AAFP 2019 guidelines recommend to do not prescribe OTC cold medications in pediatric patients (< 4 years old) with common cold because of potential harms and lack of benefit.

### Antihistamines for the common cold [^3e12b651]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Although antihistamines are prescribed in large quantities for the common cold, there is little evidence to whether these drugs are effective.

Objectives

To assess in patients with a common cold the effects of antihistamines in alleviating nasal symptoms, or in shortening of illness duration.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Group Specialized Register and EMBASE up to December 2002; Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and MEDLINE up to February 2003. We also followed up references in identified papers. We appealed for further articles at a major international conference on Acute Respiratory Infections (1997). We corresponded with experts and got in touch with pharmaceutical companies.

Selection Criteria

Randomised, placebo-controlled trials on treatment of common cold with antihistamines, used either singly or in combination, in adults or children.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data were extracted by two reviewers and authors were contacted for further data. Trials were subdivided into monotherapy and combination therapy. Data on general recovery, nasal obstruction, rhinorrhea, sneezing, and side-effects were extracted and summarized in a systematic review.

Main Results

We included thirty two papers describing 35 comparisons; 22 trials studied monotherapy, 13 trials a combination of antihistamines with other medication. A total of 8930 people suffering from the common cold were included. There were large differences in study designs, participants, interventions, and outcomes. There was no evidence of any clinically significant effect - in children or in adults - on general recovery of antihistamines in monotherapy. First generation - but not non-sedating - antihistamines have a small effect on rhinorrhea and sneezing. In trials with first generation antihistamines the incidence of side effects (especially sedation) is significantly higher with active treatment. Two trials, studying a combination of antihistamines with decongestives in small children, both failed to show any effect. Of the eleven trials on older children and adults, the majority show an effect on general recovery and on nasal symptom severity.

Reviewer's Conclusions

Antihistamines in monotherapy - in children as well as in adults - do not alleviate to a clinical extend nasal congestion, rhinorrhoea and sneezing, or subjective improvement of the common cold. First generation antihistamines also cause more side-effects than placebo, in particular they increase sedation in cold sufferers. Combinations of antihistamines with decongestives are not effective in small children. In older children and adults most trials show a beneficial effect on general recovery as well as on nasal symptoms. It is however not clear whether these effects are clinically significant.

### Common cold [^3651291f]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2011). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Each year, children suffer up to 5 colds and adults have two to three infections, leading to time off school or work, and considerable discomfort. Most symptoms resolve within 1 week, but coughs often persist for longer.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of treatments for common cold? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to January 2010 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 21 systematic reviews and RCTs that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: analgesics or anti-inflammatory drugs, antibiotics, antihistamines, decongestants for short-term and for long-term relief, decongestants plus antihistamines, echinacea, steam inhalation, vitamin C, and zinc (intranasal gel or lozenges).

### Common cold [^1343e0ab]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2008). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Each year, children suffer up to 5 colds and adults have 2–3 infections, leading to time off school or work, and considerable discomfort. Most symptoms resolve within a week, but coughs often persist for longer.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of treatments for common cold? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library and other important databases up to May 2007 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 19 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: analgesics or anti-inflammatory drugs, antibiotics, antihistamines, decongestants (norephedrine, oxymetazoline, or pseudoephedrine), decongestants plus antihistamine, echinacea, steam inhalation, vitamin C, and zinc (intranasal gel or lozenges).

### Treatment of the common cold [^9c9f98f1]. American Family Physician (2019). Medium credibility.

Acute upper respiratory tract infections are extremely common in adults and children, but only a few safe and effective treatments are available. Patients typically present with nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, sore throat, cough, general malaise, and/or low-grade fever. Informing patients about the self-limited nature of the common cold can help manage expectations, limit antibiotic use, and avoid over-the-counter purchases that may not help. Treatments with proven effectiveness for cold symptoms in adults include over-the-counter analgesics, zinc, nasal decongestants with or without antihistamines, and ipratropium for cough. Lower-quality evidence suggests that Lactobacillus casei may be beneficial in older adults. The only established safe and effective treatments for children are acetylcysteine, honey (for children one year and older), nasal saline irrigation, intranasal ipratropium, and topical application of ointment containing camphor, menthol, and eucalyptus oils. Over-the-counter cold medications should not be used in children younger than four years. Counseling patients about the importance of good hand hygiene is the best way to prevent transmission of cold viruses.

### Nasal decongestants for the common cold [^1f156404]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Background

The common cold is a major and recurrent cause of morbidity, on average affecting children and adults two or more times each year. Nasal congestion is its commonest symptom and many therapies are marketed for its relief. There is no meta-analysis of controlled clinical trials on the effects of nasal decongestants in the common cold.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy of nasal decongestants at reducing the symptom of nasal congestion in adults and children with the common cold and to identify possible adverse effects associated with their use.

Search Strategy

In this updated review in 2006, the following databases were searched: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library, Issue 3, 2006); MEDLINE (January 1996 to September 2006); OLDMEDLINE (1951 to 1965); EMBASE (1980 to Week 36, 2006). We contacted known principal investigators and pharmaceutical companies.

Selection Criteria

Randomised, placebo controlled trials of single-active oral and topical nasal decongestants in adults and children suffering from common cold.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors (DT and GJL) independently extracted data. All outcomes variables were continuous. Subjective outcomes were normalised to a common scale and a weighted mean difference (WMD) was calculated. A standardised mean difference (SMD) was calculated for the objective outcomes.

Main Results

Seven studies in adults, but none in children, fitted all inclusion criteria. There was a small but statistically significant 6% decrease in subjective symptoms after a single dose of decongestant compared with placebo. This was supported by a significant decrease in nasal airways resistance. With repeated doses, nasal decongestants produce a very small statistical benefit of 4% over three to five days, again supported by a decrease in nasal airways resistance. Two studies provided safety data for this meta-analysis, showing a relatively small number of adverse events and only a small increased risk of insomnia with pseudoephedrine compared to placebo.

Authors' Conclusions

A single oral dose of nasal decongestant in the common cold is modestly effective for the short term relief of congestion in adults, and these drugs also provide benefit in some individuals after regular use over three to five days. Adverse events in adults are rare and mild. There is insufficient data on the use of these medications in children and therefore they are not recommended for use in children younger than 12 years of age with the common cold.

### Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for the common cold [^8778affc]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have been widely used for the treatment of pain and fever associated with the common cold. However, there is no systematic review to assess the effects of NSAIDs in treating the common cold.

Objectives

To determine the effects of NSAIDs versus placebo (and other treatments) on signs and symptoms of the common cold, and to determine any adverse effects of NSAIDs in people with the common cold.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2013, Issue 1), MEDLINE (January 1966 to April week 4, 2013), EMBASE (January 1980 to April 2013), CINAHL (January 1982 to April 2013) and ProQuest Digital Dissertations (January 1938 to April 2013).

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of NSAIDS in adults or children with the common cold.

Data Collection and Analysis

Four review authors extracted data. We subdivided trials into placebo-controlled RCTs and head-to-head comparisons of NSAIDs. We extracted and summarised data on global efficacies of analgesic effects (such as reduction of headache and myalgia), non-analgesic effects (such as reduction of nasal symptoms, cough, sputum and sneezing) and side effects. We expressed dichotomous outcomes as risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) and continuous data as mean differences (MD) or standardised mean differences (SMD). We pooled data using the fixed- and random-effects models.

Main Results

We included nine RCTs with 1069 participants, describing 37 comparisons: six were NSAIDs versus placebo and three were NSAIDs versus NSAIDs. The overall risk of bias in the included studies was mixed. In a pooled analysis, NSAIDs did not significantly reduce the total symptom score (SMD -0.40, 95% CI -1.03 to 0.24, three studies, random-effects model), or duration of colds (MD -0.23, 95% CI -1.75 to 1.29, two studies, random-effects model). For respiratory symptoms, cough did not improve (SMD -0.05, 95% CI -0.66 to 0.56, two studies, random-effects model) but the sneezing score significantly improved (SMD -0.44, 95% CI -0.75 to -0.12, two studies, random-effects model). For outcomes related to the analgesic effects of NSAIDs (headache, ear pain, and muscle and joint pain) the treatment produced significant benefits. The risk of adverse effects was not high with NSAIDs (RR 2.94, 95% CI 0.51 to 17.03, two studies, random-effects model) and it is difficult to conclude that such drugs are not different from placebo.

Authors' Conclusions

NSAIDs are somewhat effective in relieving discomfort caused by a cold but there is no clear evidence of their effect in easing respiratory symptoms. The balance of benefit and harms needs to be considered when using NSAIDs for colds.

### WITHDRAWN: antihistamines for the common cold [^4a79b4c7]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Although antihistamines are prescribed in large quantities for the common cold, there is little evidence as to whether these drugs are effective.

Objectives

To assess in patients with a common cold the effects of antihistamines in alleviating nasal symptoms, or the shortening the duration of illness.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library, 2002, issue 4), which contains the Acute Respiratory Infections Group's Specilaized Register; MEDLINE (1966 to February 2003); and EMBASE (1987 to December 2002).

Selection Criteria

Randomised, placebo-controlled trials on treatment of common cold with antihistamines, used either singly or in combination, in adults or children.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors extracted data and trial authors were contacted for further data. Trials were subdivided into monotherapy and combination therapy. Data on general recovery, nasal obstruction, rhinorrhea, sneezing, and side-effects were extracted and summarized.

Main Results

We included 32 papers describing 35 comparisons; 22 trials studied monotherapy, 13 trials a combination of antihistamines with other medication. A total of 8930 people suffering from the common cold were included. There were large differences in study designs, participants, interventions, and outcomes. There was no evidence of any clinically significant effect - in children or in adults - on general recovery of antihistamines in monotherapy. First generation - but not non-sedating - antihistamines have a small effect on rhinorrhea and sneezing. In trials with first generation antihistamines the incidence of side effects (especially sedation) is significantly higher with active treatment. Two trials, studying a combination of antihistamines with decongestives in small children, both failed to show any effect. Of the 11 trials on older children and adults, the majority show an effect on general recovery and on nasal symptom severity.

Authors' Conclusions

Antihistamines in monotherapy - in children as well as in adults - do not alleviate to a clinical extent nasal congestion, rhinorrhoea and sneezing, or subjective improvement of the common cold. First generation antihistamines also cause more side-effects than placebo, in particular they increase sedation in cold sufferers. Combinations of antihistamines with decongestives are not effective in small children. In older children and adults most trials show a beneficial effect on general recovery as well as on nasal symptoms. However, it is not clear whether these effects are clinically significant.

### Treatment of the common cold [^37920dfe]. American Family Physician (2007). Low credibility.

The common cold is a viral illness that affects persons of all ages, prompting frequent use of over-the-counter and prescription medications and alternative remedies. Treatment focuses on relieving symptoms (e.g., cough, nasal congestion, rhinorrhea). Dextromethorphan may be beneficial in adults with cough, but its effectiveness has not been demonstrated in children and adolescents. Codeine has not been shown to effectively treat cough caused by the common cold. Although hydrocodone is widely used and has been shown to effectively treat cough caused by other conditions, the drug has not been studied in patients with colds. Topical (intranasal) and oral nasal decongestants have been shown to relieve nasal symptoms and can be used in adolescents and adults for up to three days. Antihistamines and combination antihistamine/decongestant therapies can modestly improve symptoms in adults; however, the benefits must be weighed against potential side effects. Newer nonsedating antihistamines are ineffective against cough. Topical ipratropium, a prescription anticholinergic, relieves nasal symptoms in older children and adults. Antibiotics have not been shown to improve symptoms or shorten illness duration. Complementary and alternative therapies (i.e. Echinacea, vitamin C, and zinc) are not recommended for treating common cold symptoms; however, humidified air and fluid intake may be useful without adverse side effects. Vitamin C prophylaxis may modestly reduce the duration and severity of the common cold in the general population and may reduce the incidence of the illness in persons exposed to physical and environmental stresses.

### Duration of symptoms of respiratory tract infections in children: systematic review [^a278cecb]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Respiratory tract infections are particularly common in children; most are self limiting and the risk of complications is small. Recommended management therefore typically involves self care and treatment of symptoms. Nevertheless, such infections still account for over a third of paediatric consultations to primary care in the United Kingdom and the United States, and antibiotics are commonly prescribed in many countries despite limited evidence of effectiveness.

One of the most common questions that parents ask when consulting healthcare services is "how long will my child's symptoms last?" Accurate information about the expected course of respiratory tract infections in children is essential for both clinicians and parents, as it sets expectations and lets them know when the illness is deviating from the expected. This directly informs parents' decisions to seek medical attention, whether to re-consult, and when to use delayed prescriptions of antibiotics, as well as clinicians' decisions on when to prescribe antibiotics or consider other treatments.

Commonly used estimates of the expected time course of symptoms of common respiratory tract infections are highly variable and not always evidence based. For example, the 2008 National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines for treatment of respiratory tract infections include estimates of average duration of the illness (before and after seeing a doctor) of four days for acute otitis media, one week for acute sore throat, one and a half weeks for the common cold, and three weeks for acute cough or bronchitis. By contrast, information for patients from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention describe sore throat as lasting one to two weeks, common cold lasting up to two weeks, and cough duration ranging from two to eight weeks. The durations quoted in these sources reflect findings based on expert opinion or from individual studies rather than from data synthesis of multiple studies and are not child specific. We therefore conducted a systematic review of the literature on symptom durations of the most common respiratory tract infections (earache, sore throat, cough, and common cold) in children presenting to primary care.

### Pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatment for acute cough associated with the common cold: CHEST expert panel report [^efa95144]. Chest (2017). Medium credibility.

CHEST Expert Panel — acute cough due to the common cold — issues ungraded consensus-based suggestions as follows: For adult and pediatric patients, "we suggest against the use of over the counter cough and cold medicines until they have been shown to make cough less severe or resolve sooner" (Ungraded Consensus-Based Statement). In adult patients, "we suggest against the use of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents until they have been shown to make cough less severe or resolve sooner" (Ungraded Consensus-Based Statement). In pediatric patients (aged 1–18 years), "we suggest honey may offer more relief for cough symptoms than no treatment, diphenhydramine, or placebo, but it is not better than dextromethorphan" (Ungraded Consensus-Based Statement), with the remark that "Infants < 1 year of age should not be administered honey, and children < 2 years of age should not be administered dextromethorphan for cough symptoms". In pediatric patients (aged < 18 years), "we suggest avoiding use of codeine-containing medications because of the potential for serious side effects including respiratory distress" (Ungraded Consensus-Based Statement).

### Nasal decongestants in monotherapy for the common cold [^7b3209a8]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Many treatments for the common cold exist and are sold over-the-counter. Nevertheless, evidence on the effectiveness and safety of nasal decongestants is limited.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy, and short- and long-term safety, of nasal decongestants used in monotherapy to alleviate symptoms of the common cold in adults and children.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, Issue 6, June 2016), which contains the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections (ARI) Specialised Register, MEDLINE (1946 to July 2016), Embase (2010 to 15 July 2016), CINAHL (1981 to 15 July 2016), LILACS (1982 to July 2016), Web of Science (1955 to July 2016) and clinical trials registers.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and cluster-RCTs investigating the effectiveness and adverse effects of nasal decongestants compared with placebo for treating the common cold in adults and children. We excluded quasi-RCTs.

Data Collection and Analysis

Three review authors independently extracted and summarised data on subjective measures of nasal congestion, overall patient well-being score, objective measures of nasal airway resistance, adverse effects and general recovery. One review author acted as arbiter in cases of disagreement. We categorised trials as single and multi-dose and analysed data both separately and together. We also analysed studies using an oral or topical nasal decongestant separately and together.

Main Results

We included 15 trials with 1838 participants. Fourteen studies included adult participants only (aged 18 years and over). In six studies the intervention was a single dose and in nine studies multiple doses were used. Nine studies used pseudoephedrine and three studies used oxymetazoline. Other decongestants included phenylpropanolamine, norephedrine and xylometazoline. Phenylpropanolamine (or norephedrine) is no longer available on the market therefore we did not include the results of these studies in the meta-analyses. Eleven studies used oral decongestants; four studies used topical decongestants. Participants were included after contracting the common cold. The duration of symptoms differed among studies; in 10 studies participants had symptoms for less than three days, in three studies symptoms were present for less than five days, one study counted the number of colds over one year, and one study experimentally induced the common cold. In the single-dose studies, the effectiveness of a nasal decongestant was measured on the same day, whereas the follow-up in multi-dose studies ranged between one and 10 days. Most studies were conducted in university settings (N = eight), six at a specific university common cold centre. Three studies were conducted at a university in collaboration with a hospital and two in a hospital only setting. In two studies the setting was unclear. There were large differences in the reporting of outcomes and the reporting of methods in most studies was limited. Therefore, we judged most studies to be at low or unclear risk of bias. Pooling was possible for a limited number of studies only; measures of effect are expressed as standardised mean differences (SMDs). A positive SMD represents an improvement in congestion. There is no defined minimal clinically important difference for measures of subjective improvement in nasal congestion, therefore we used the SMDs as a guide to assess whether an effect was small (0.2 to 0.49), moderate (0.5 to 0.79) or large (≥ 0.8). Single-dose decongestant versus placebo: 10 studies compared a single dose of nasal decongestant with placebo and their effectiveness was tested between 15 minutes and 10 hours after dosing. Seven of 10 studies reported subjective symptom scores for nasal congestion; none reported overall patient well-being. However, pooling was not possible due to the large diversity in the measurement and reporting of symptoms of congestion. Two studies recorded adverse events. Both studies used an oral decongestant and each of them showed that there was no statistical difference between the number of adverse events in the treatment group versus the placebo group. Multi-dose decongestant versus placebo: nine studies compared multiple doses of nasal decongestants with placebo, but only five reported on the primary outcome, subjective symptom scores for nasal congestion. Only one study used a topical decongestant; none reported overall patient well-being. Subjective measures of congestion were significantly better for the treatment group compared with placebo approximately three hours after the last dose (SMD 0.49, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.07 to 0.92; P = 0.02; GRADE: low-quality evidence). However, the SMD of 0.49 only indicates a small clinical effect. Pooling was based on two studies, one oral and one topical, therefore we were unable to assess the effects of oral and topical decongestants separately. Seven studies reported adverse events (six oral and one topical decongestant); meta-analysis showed that there was no statistical difference between the number of adverse events in the treatment group (125 per 1000) compared to the placebo group (126 per 1000). The odds ratio (OR) for adverse events in the treatment group was 0.98 (95% CI 0.68 to 1.40; P = 0.90; GRADE: low-quality evidence). The results remained the same when we only considered studies using an oral decongestant (OR 0.95, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.39; P = 0.80; GRADE: low-quality evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

We were unable to draw conclusions on the effectiveness of single-dose nasal decongestants due to the limited evidence available. For multiple doses of nasal decongestants, the current evidence suggests that these may have a small positive effect on subjective measures of nasal congestion in adults with the common cold. However, the clinical relevance of this small effect is unknown and there is insufficient good-quality evidence to draw any firm conclusions. Due to the small number of studies that used a topical nasal decongestant, we were also unable to draw conclusions on the effectiveness of oral versus topical decongestants. Nasal decongestants do not seem to increase the risk of adverse events in adults in the short term. The effectiveness and safety of nasal decongestants in children and the clinical relevance of their small effect in adults is yet to be determined.

### Oral antihistamine-decongestant-analgesic combinations for the common cold [^ff39cedf]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Although combination formulas containing antihistamines, decongestants, and/or analgesics are sold over-the-counter in large quantities for the common cold, the evidence for their effectiveness is limited. This is an update of a review first published in 2012.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of antihistamine-decongestant-analgesic combinations compared with placebo or other active controls (excluding antibiotics) in reducing the duration of symptoms and alleviating symptoms (general feeling of illness, nasal congestion, rhinorrhoea, sneezing, and cough) in children and adults with the common cold.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE via EBSCOhost, Embase, CINAHL via EBSCOhost, LILACS, and Web of Science to 10 June 2021. We searched the WHO ICTRP and ClinicalTrials.gov on 10 June 2021.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials investigating the effectiveness of antihistamine-decongestant-analgesic combinations compared with placebo, other active treatment (excluding antibiotics), or no treatment in children and adults with the common cold.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. We categorised the included trials according to the active ingredients.

Main Results

We identified 30 studies (6304 participants) including 31 treatment comparisons. The control intervention was placebo in 26 trials and an active substance (paracetamol, chlorphenindione + phenylpropanolamine + belladonna, diphenhydramine) in six trials (two trials had placebo as well as active treatment arms). Reporting of methods was generally poor, and there were large differences in study design, participants, interventions, and outcomes. Most of the included trials involved adult participants. Children were included in nine trials. Three trials included very young children (from six months to five years), and five trials included children aged 2 to 16. One trial included adults and children aged 12 years or older. The trials took place in different settings: university clinics, paediatric departments, family medicine departments, and general practice surgeries. Antihistamine-decongestant: 14 trials (1298 participants). Eight trials reported on global effectiveness, of which six studies were pooled (281 participants on active treatment and 284 participants on placebo). The odds ratio (OR) of treatment failure was 0.31 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.20 to 0.48; moderate certainty evidence); number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 3.9 (95% CI 3.03 to 5.2). On the final evaluation day (follow-up: 3 to 10 days), 55% of participants in the placebo group had a favourable response compared to 70% on active treatment. Of the two trials not pooled, one showed some global effect, whilst the other showed no effect. Adverse effects: the antihistamine-decongestant group experienced more adverse effects than the control group: 128/419 (31%) versus 100/423 (13%) participants suffered one or more adverse effects (OR 1.58, 95%CI 0.78 to 3.21; moderate certainty of evidence). Antihistamine-analgesic: four trials (1608 participants). Two trials reported on global effectiveness; data from one trial were presented (290 participants on active treatment and 292 participants on ascorbic acid). The OR of treatment failure was 0.33 (95% CI 0.23 to 0.46; moderate certainty evidence); NNTB 6.67 (95% CI 4.76 to 12.5). Forty-three per cent of participants in the control group and 70% in the active treatment group were cured after six days of treatment. The second trial also showed an effect in favour of the active treatment. Adverse effects: there were not significantly more adverse effects in the active treatment group compared to placebo (drowsiness, hypersomnia, sleepiness 10/152 versus 4/120; OR 1.64 (95% CI 0.48 to 5.59; low certainty evidence). Analgesic-decongestant: seven trials (2575 participants). One trial reported on global effectiveness: 73% of participants in the analgesic-decongestant group reported a benefit compared with 52% in the control group (paracetamol) (OR of treatment failure 0.28, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.52; moderate certainty evidence; NNTB 4.7). Adverse effects: the decongestant-analgesic group experienced significantly more adverse effects than the control group (199/1122 versus 75/675; OR 1.62 95% CI 1.18 to 2.23; high certainty evidence; number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH 17). Antihistamine-analgesic-decongestant: six trials (1014 participants). Five trials reported on global effectiveness, of which two studies in adults could be pooled: global effect reported with active treatment (52%) and placebo (34%) was equivalent to a difference of less than one point on a four- or five-point scale; the OR of treatment failure was 0.47 (95% CI 0.33 to 0.67; low certainty evidence); NNTB 5.6 (95% CI 3.8 to 10.2). One trial in children aged 2 to 12 years, and two trials in adults found no beneficial effect. Adverse effects: in one trial 5/224 (2%) suffered adverse effects with the active treatment versus 9/208 (4%) with placebo. Two other trials reported no differences between treatment groups.

Authors' Conclusions

We found a lack of data on the effectiveness of antihistamine-analgesic-decongestant combinations for the common cold. Based on these scarce data, the effect on individual symptoms is probably too small to be clinically relevant. The current evidence suggests that antihistamine-analgesic-decongestant combinations have some general benefit in adults and older children. These benefits must be weighed against the risk of adverse effects. There is no evidence of effectiveness in young children. In 2005, the US Food and Drug Administration issued a warning about adverse effects associated with the use of over-the-counter nasal preparations containing phenylpropanolamine.

### Oral antihistamine-decongestant-analgesic combinations for the common cold [^30d89d96]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Although combination formulas containing antihistamines, decongestants and/or analgesics are sold over-the-counter (OTC) in large quantities for the common cold, the evidence of effectiveness is limited.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of antihistamine-decongestant-analgesic combinations in reducing the duration and alleviating the symptoms of the common cold in adults and children.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2011, Issue 4), which contains the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Group's Specialised Register, OLDMEDLINE (1953 to 1965), MEDLINE (1966 to November Week 3, 2011) and EMBASE (1990 to December 2011).

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) investigating the effectiveness of antihistamine-decongestant-analgesic combinations compared with placebo, other active treatment (excluding antibiotics) or no treatment in children and adults with the common cold.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted and summarised data on general recovery, nasal obstruction, rhinorrhoea, sneezing, cough and side effects. We categorised the trials according to the active ingredients.

Main Results

We included 27 trials (5117 participants) of common cold treatments. Fourteen trials studied antihistamine-decongestant combinations; two antihistamine-analgesic; six analgesic-decongestant; and five antihistamine-analgesic-decongestant combinations. In 21 trials the control intervention was placebo and in six trials an active substance. Reporting of methods in most trials was poor and there were large differences in design, participants, interventions and outcomes. Pooling was only possible for a limited number of studies and outcomes. Antihistamine-decongestant: 12 trials. Eight trials report on global effectiveness, six could be pooled; n = 309 on active treatment, n = 312 placebo) the odds ratio (OR) of treatment failure was 0.27 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.15 to 0.50); the number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) was four (95% CI 3 to 5.6). On the final evaluation day 41% of participants in the placebo group had a favourable response compared to 66% on active treatment. Of the two trials that were not included in the pooling, one showed some global effect, the other showed no effect. Antihistamine-analgesic: three trials. Two reported on global effectiveness, data from one study was presented. (n = 290 on active treatment, n = 292 ascorbic acid). The OR of treatment failure was 0.33 (95% CI 0.23 to 0.46) and the NNTB was 6.67 (95% CI 4.76 to 12.5). After six days of treatment 43% were cured in the control group and 70% in the active treatment group. The second study also showed an effect in favour of active treatment. Analgesic-decongestant: six trials. One trial reported on global effectiveness: 73% benefited compared with 52% in the control group (paracetamol) (OR 0.28, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.52). Antihistamine-analgesic-decongestant: Five trials. Four trials reported on global effectiveness, two could be pooled: global effect reported (less than one severity point on a four or five-point scale) with active treatment (52%) and placebo (34%); the OR of treatment failure was 0.47 (95% CI 0.33 to 0.67) and the NNTB was 5.6 (95% CI 3.8 to 10.2). Two other trials found no beneficial effect. Two other studies did not show any effect. Two studies with antihistamine-decongestant (113 children) could not be pooled. There was no significant effect of the active treatment. Adverse effects: the combination of antihistamine-decongestant had more adverse effects than the control intervention but the difference was not significant: 157/810 (19%) versus 60/477 (13%) participants suffered one or more adverse effects (OR 1.58, 95% CI 0.78 to 3.21). Analgesic-decongestant combinations had significantly more adverse effects than control (OR 1.71, 95% CI 1.23 to 2.37); the number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH) was 14. None of the other two combinations caused significantly more adverse effects. Antihistamine-analgesic: 11/90 with combination suffered one or more adverse effects (12%) versus 9/91 (10%) with control (OR 1.27, 95% CI 0.50 to 3.23). Antihistamine-analgesic-decongestant: in one study 5/224 (2%) suffered adverse effects with active treatment versus 9/208 (4%) with placebo. Two other trials reported no differences between treatment groups but numbers were not reported.

Authors' Conclusions

Current evidence suggests that antihistamine-analgesic-decongestant combinations have some general benefit in adults and older children. These benefits must be weighed against the risk of adverse effects. There is no evidence of effectiveness in young children.

Common cold — over-the-counter (OTC) medications for acute cough in children and adults in community settings are summarized as follows: Antitussive agents included 6 adult studies and 4 child studies with 1,526 adults and 327 children; pooling not possible and studies had variable results, with quality very low. Expectorants comprised 3 studies (604), with pooling not possible and studies had conflicting results, quality very low. Mucolytic agents had 1 adult study and 1 child study with 99 adults and 40 children; pooling not possible; quality very low. Other combinations included 4 adult studies and 2 child studies with 836 adults and 94 children; pooling not possible; studies were very small, heterogeneous, and used very different drug preparations and dosing frequency, limiting their comparability; quality very low. Vicks VapoRub was evaluated in 1 child study with 138 children, showing change in cough frequency −1.5 placebo vs Vicks VapoRub −2.5; P = 0.07 and change in cough severity −1.4 placebo vs Vicks VapoRub −2.1; P = 0.06, with quality low.

Zinc lozenges for acute cough associated with the common cold — adult signal, pediatric data, and prophylaxis guidance: Zinc lozenges (dosed ≥ 75 mg/d) given within 24 hours of symptom onset may reduce the duration of cold symptoms, such as cough, in healthy individuals, and a 2008 adult study reported a significant reduction in the duration of cold symptoms and cough in 50 adult patients. A suggestion for the use of zinc lozenges in healthy adults with cough due to common cold was considered by the expert panel; however, due to weak evidence, the potential side effects of zinc, and the relatively benign and common nature of the condition being treated, the panel did not approve inclusion of this suggestion. In pediatrics, no systematic review is available and no recommendation can be made for the use of zinc supplements to reduce the duration and severity of cough. A pediatric trial assessed the efficacy of 15 mg of chelated zinc given once daily vs placebo for 3 months during the winter season to 100 children aged 8 to 13 years in Thailand, with no significant difference in the incidence of common cold symptoms while reporting significantly reduced duration of cough in the intervention group. No recommendation can be made for the use of zinc supplement prophylaxis.

CHEST Expert Panel — honey for pediatric cough due to the common cold — in pediatric patients (aged 1–18 years) with cough due to the common cold, we suggest honey may offer more relief for cough symptoms than no treatment, diphenhydramine, or placebo, but it is not better than dextromethorphan (Ungraded Consensus-Based Statement). Supporting trials included a comparison of honey to diphenhydramine with 40 subjects in each group, two randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in which honey was probably better than no treatment in 154 participants, and a third RCT of 300 pediatric patients indicating honey may be better than placebo; infants < 1 year of age should not be administered honey, and children < 2 years of age should not be administered dextromethorphan for cough symptoms.

### Non-antibiotic treatments for upper-respiratory tract infections (common cold) [^a05ba89c]. Respiratory Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Objectives

To review the seven Cochrane reviews of non-antibiotic treatment for the common cold.

Methods

Each Cochrane review was read and summarized, and results presented as relative risks and, where possible, numbers needed to treat.

Results

The main theme that runs through these Cochrane reviews is the variable quality of the primary studies. In general, the reviewers are fairly cautious about the benefits of any of the treatments other than first-dose decongestants and antihistamine-decongestant combinations. For antihistamines alone, the reviewers were clear about the lack of efficacy except in the high-quality studies in which a global improvement in symptoms was noted. Some studies were statistically significant, but the Cochrane reviewers were guarded about how clinically significant they were. For Echinacea, problems were found with the quality of the studies and the wide range of different forms of this substance. Heated humidified air seemed to be effective in the UK and Israel, but not the USA, making definitive statements about efficacy difficult. Over-the-counter medication for cough seemed to have no documented benefit in children under the age of 5 years. Letosteine (a mucolytic) may be effective in children but is not available in the UK. Bisolvon (a mucolytic) was found to be effective for cough in only one study. For older children and adults, dextromethorphan may be effective (two out of three studies showed benefit), and guiafenesin (an expectorant) showed mixed benefit in two trials. Dexbrompheniramine (a sedating antihistamine)/pseudoephedrine (6 mg/120 mg twice daily for 1 week) was significantly more effective than placebo for severity of cough, whereas, in another study, loratadine (a non-sedating antihistamine)/pseudoephedrine (5 mg/120 mg twice daily for 4 days) did not show any difference between the study groups. Vitamin C may have a small role in preventing the common cold, with possibly a greater role in high-intensity physical activity and sub-arctic conditions. Zinc lozenges seemed to be effective, but the issue of unblinding due to taste was a methodological issue of concern to the reviewers. The benefits and harms are calculated as numbers needed to treat for one person to benefit (NNTB) and numbers needed to treat for one person to harm (NNTH), and were calculated by the author.

Conclusion

Most non-antibiotic treatments for the common cold are probably not effective. The most promising are dextromethorphan, bisolvon and guiaphenesin for cough, antihistamine-decongestant combinations for a wide range of symptoms, nasal decongestants (at least for the first dose) and possibly zinc lozenges.

### Echinacea for preventing and treating the common cold [^c062c8af]. JAMA (2015). Excellent credibility.

Clinical Question

Are Echinacea products associated with a reduced incidence and a shorter duration of common colds compared with placebo?

Bottom Line

Individual prophylaxis trials show no association with prevention of the common cold, but exploratory meta-analysis suggests that Echinacea products may be associated with a small reduction in cold incidence. In treatment trials, there was no association of Echinacea products with a shorter duration of colds.

### Treatment of the common cold in children and adults [^d7043560]. American Family Physician (2012). Low credibility.

The common cold, or upper respiratory tract infection, is one of the leading reasons for physician visits. Generally caused by viruses, the common cold is treated symptomatically. Antibiotics are not effective in children or adults. In children, there is a potential for harm and no benefits with over-the-counter cough and cold medications; therefore, they should not be used in children younger than four years. Other commonly used medications, such as inhaled corticosteroids, oral prednisolone, and Echinacea, also are ineffective in children. Products that improve symptoms in children include vapor rub, zinc sulfate, Pelargonium sidoides (geranium) extract, and buckwheat honey. Prophylactic probiotics, zinc sulfate, nasal saline irrigation, and the herbal preparation Chizukit reduce the incidence of colds in children. For adults, antihistamines, intranasal corticosteroids, codeine, nasal saline irrigation, Echinacea angustifolia preparations, and steam inhalation are ineffective at relieving cold symptoms. Pseudoephedrine, phenylephrine, inhaled ipratropium, and zinc (acetate or gluconate) modestly reduce the severity and duration of symptoms for adults. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and some herbal preparations, including Echinacea purpurea, improve symptoms in adults. Prophylactic use of garlic may decrease the frequency of colds in adults, but has no effect on duration of symptoms. Hand hygiene reduces the spread of viruses that cause cold illnesses. Prophylactic vitamin C modestly reduces cold symptom duration in adults and children.

### Over-the-counter cough and cold medications in children: are they helpful? [^b4f6c447]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Over-the-counter cough/cold medications are commonly used in children. Recent recommendations by the Food and Drug Administration and changes to product labeling by cough/cold product manufacturers have reduced use of these products in children younger than four years of age. Data from controlled clinical trials of cough/cold product ingredients do not support their efficacy in young children. Serious adverse effects have been reported from cough/cold product use in infants and children, which largely result from inappropriate use by caregivers. Conservative therapies, including nasal suctioning, humidification, and nasal saline, should be recommended over cough/cold product use for infants and children. Otolaryngologists should educate caregivers of children on the safe and effective use of these products and therapies.

Systematic review scope and methods — acute cough associated with the common cold (CACC) — are described as follows. The panel stated it "believed it would be beneficial to perform a systematic review to update the recommendations of the 2006 guideline". The clinical question was specified: "The review question was: Is there evidence of clinically relevant treatment effects for pharmacologic or nonpharmacologic therapies in reducing the duration/severity of acute CACC?" Methods conformed to CHEST processes: "The methods used for this systematic review conformed to those outlined in the article 'Methodologies for the Development of CHEST Guidelines and Expert Panel Reports'. Sources included guideline repositories: "The National Guideline Clearinghouse (http://www.guideline.gov) and the Guidelines International Network (http://www.g-i-n.net) were searched for existing guidelines on pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatment for CACC". Databases and timeframe were comprehensive: "Systematic reviews and clinical trials were identified from searches of electronic databases (PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials [Cochrane Library], Google Scholar, and CINAHL), commencing from the earliest available date until April 2016". Search terms were prespecified: "The search terms used were common cold, cough, antihistamine, decongestant, cough suppressant, antitussive, antibiotic, zinc, expectorant, acute cough, anticholinergic, topical steroids, upper respiratory tract infection". A consensus approach was applied: "A highly structured consensus-based Delphi approach was used to provide expert advice on all guidance statements".

### Heated, humidified air for the common cold [^d1be0184]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Heated, humidified air has long been used by people with the common cold. The theoretical basis is that steam may help congested mucus drain better and that heat may destroy the cold virus as it does in vitro. This is an update of a review last published in 2013.

Objectives

To assess the effects of inhaling heated water vapour (steam) in the treatment of the common cold by comparing symptoms, viral shedding, and nasal resistance.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (to February 2017), MEDLINE (1966 to 24 February 2017), Embase (1990 to 24 February 2017), and Current Contents (1998 to 24 February 2017). We also searched World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) (8 March 2017) and ClinicalTrials.gov (8 March 2017) as well as reference lists of included studies.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials using heated water vapour in participants with the common cold or experimentally induced common cold were eligible for inclusion.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Three review authors independently screened titles and abstracts for inclusion of potential studies identified from the search. We recorded the selection process in sufficient detail to complete a PRISMA flow diagram. We used a data collection form for study characteristics and outcome data that was developed and used for previous versions of this review. Two review authors independently extracted data, and a third review author resolved any disagreements. We used Review Manager 5 software to analyse data.

Main Results

We included six trials from five publications involving a total of 387 participants. We included no new studies in this 2017 update. The 'Risk of bias' assessment suggested an unclear risk of bias in the domain of randomisation and a low risk of bias in performance, detection, attrition, and reporting. It was uncertain whether heated, humidified air provides symptomatic relief for the common cold, as the fixed-effect analysis showed evidence of an effect (odds ratio (OR) 0.30, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.16 to 0.56; 2 studies, 149 participants), but the random-effects analysis showed no significant difference in the results (OR 0.22, 95% CI 0.03 to 1.95). There is an argument for using either form of analysis. No studies demonstrated an exacerbation of clinical symptom scores. One study conducted in the USA demonstrated worsened nasal resistance, but an earlier Israeli study showed improvement. One study examined viral shedding in nasal washings, finding no significant difference between treatment and placebo groups (OR 0.47, 95% CI 0.04 to 5.19). As judged by the subjective response to therapy (i.e. therapy did not help), the number of participants reporting resolution of symptoms was not significantly higher in the heated humidified group (OR 0.58, 95% CI 0.28 to 1.18; 2 studies, 124 participants). There was significant heterogeneity in the effects of heated, humidified air on different outcomes, therefore we graded the quality of the evidence as low. Some studies reported minor adverse events (including discomfort or irritation of the nose).

Authors' Conclusions

The current evidence does not show any benefits or harms from the use of heated, humidified air delivered via the RhinoTherm device for the treatment of the common cold. There is a need for more double-blind, randomised trials that include standardised treatment modalities.

### Efficacy of a carrageenan nasal spray in patients with common cold: a randomized controlled trial [^5c3e1e18]. Respiratory Research (2013). Low credibility.

Background

The common cold is the most widespread viral infection in humans. Iota-carrageenan has previously shown antiviral effectiveness against cold viruses in clinical trials. This study investigated the efficacy of a carrageenan-containing nasal spray on the duration of the common cold and nasal fluid viral load in adult patients.

Methods

In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 211 patients suffering from early symptoms of the common cold were treated for seven days. Application was performed three times daily with either a carrageenan-supplemented nasal spray or saline solution as placebo with an overall observation period of 21 days. The primary endpoint was the duration of disease defined as the time until the last day with symptoms followed by all other days in the study period without symptoms. During the study, but prior unblinding, the definition of disease duration was adapted from the original protocol that defines disease duration as the time period of symptoms followed by 48 hours without symptoms.

Results

In patients showing a laboratory-confirmed cold virus infection and adherence to the protocol, alleviation of symptoms was 2.1 days faster in the carrageenan group in comparison to placebo (p = 0.037). The primary endpoint that had been prespecified but was changed before unblinding was not met. Viral titers in nasal fluids showed a significantly greater decrease in carrageenan patients in the intention-to-treat population (p = 0.024) and in the per protocol population (p = 0.018) between days 1 and 3/4.

Conclusions

In adults with common cold virus infections, direct local administration of carrageenan with nasal sprays reduced the duration of cold symptoms. A significant reduction of viral load in the nasal wash fluids of patients confirmed similar findings from earlier trials in children and adults.

### Saline nasal irrigation for acute upper respiratory tract infections [^727978fa]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Acute upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs), including the common cold and rhinosinusitis, are common afflictions that cause discomfort and debilitation and contribute significantly to workplace absenteeism. Treatment is generally by antipyretic and decongestant drugs and sometimes antibiotics, even though most infections are viral. Nasal irrigation with saline is often employed as an adjunct treatment for URTI symptoms despite a relative lack of evidence for benefit in this clinical setting. This review is an update of the Cochrane review by Kassel et al, which found that saline was probably effective in reducing the severity of some symptoms associated with acute URTIs.

Objectives

To assess the effects of saline nasal irrigation for treating the symptoms of acute URTIs.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL (2014, Issue 7), MEDLINE (1966 to July week 5, 2014), EMBASE (1974 to August 2014), CINAHL (1982 to August 2014), AMED (1985 to August 2014) and LILACS (1982 to August 2014).

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing topical nasal saline treatment to other interventions in adults and children with clinically diagnosed acute URTIs.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors (DK, BM) independently assessed trial quality with the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool and extracted data. We analysed all data using the Cochrane Review Manager software. Due to the large variability of outcome measures only a small number of outcomes could be pooled for statistical analysis.

Main Results

We identified five RCTs that randomised 544 children (three studies) and 205 adults (exclusively from two studies). They all compared saline irrigation to routine care or other nose sprays, rather than placebo. We included two new trials in this update, which did not contribute data of sufficient size or quality to materially change the original findings. Most trials were small and we judged them to be of low quality, contributing to an unclear risk of bias. Most outcome measures differed greatly between included studies and therefore could not be pooled. Most results showed no difference between nasal saline treatment and control. However, one larger trial, conducted with children, did show a significant reduction in nasal secretion score (mean difference (MD) -0.31, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.48 to -0.14) and nasal breathing (obstruction) score (MD -0.33, 95% CI -0.47 to -0.19) in the saline group. However, a MD of -0.33 on a four-point symptom scale may have minimal clinical significance. The trial also showed a significant reduction in the use of decongestant medication by the saline group. Minor nasal discomfort and/or irritation was the only side effect reported by a minority of participants.

Authors' Conclusions

Nasal saline irrigation possibly has benefits for relieving the symptoms of acute URTIs. However, the included trials were generally too small and had a high risk of bias, reducing confidence in the evidence supporting this. Future trials should involve larger numbers of participants and report standardised and clinically meaningful outcome measures.

Pharmacologic treatment categories included acetylcysteine; antihistamine alone; expectorant alone; cough suppressant alone; combinations such as antihistamine + expectorant, antihistamine + suppressant, expectorant + cough suppressant, and antihistamine + suppressant + expectorant; supplements (zinc, vitamin C); antihistamine + decongestants, inhaled nasal steroids, inhaled nasal antihistamines and inhaled nasal ipratropium bromide; NSAIDs and acetaminophen; and OTC cough and cold remedies. Nonpharmacologic therapies included neti pot, chest rub (Vicks VapoRub), honey, demulcents, cough drops, gelatin, chicken soup, and complementary/alternative therapies. Comparisons/controls included other pharmacologic or nonpharmacologic therapies, placebo, head to head comparisons, and pharmacologic agents added to antibiotics vs no antibiotics.

### The common cold: the need for an effective treatment amid the FDA discussion on oral phenylephrine [^3e731578]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2024). Medium credibility.

The majority of individuals self-administer over-the-counter (OTC) cough and cold products to combat the common cold. Pharmacologic interventions to treat the common cold include analgesics, antihistamines, decongestants, and a combination of these medications. These treatments aim to alleviate the symptoms of a common cold, and several studies have demonstrated the (partial) efficacy of these products. However, the disadvantage of these products is that they reduce only some but not all of the symptoms of the common cold. For instance, acetaminophen (paracetamol) may improve nasal obstruction and runny nose, but it shows no significant improvement in other symptoms, such as sore throat, coughing or general malaise. Other popular treatments include vitamin supplements, herbal products, and honey. However, review studies have revealed only low- to moderate-quality evidence to support the efficacy of these products in reducing severity, with no impact on duration of the common cold episode. Alternatively, zinc supplementation did not reduce the severity of the common cold episode, although it has been shown to reduce the duration of a common cold episode. However, the use of zinc may be associated with bad taste and nausea. Therefore, individuals who want to use zinc should weigh the benefit of a potential shortening of the common cold episode against the risk of these unwanted side effects. Finally, a Cochrane review concluded that use of intranasal corticosteroids for symptomatic relief from the common cold was not effective. Taken together, the data indicate that currently, there is no treatment available for which scientific research has demonstrated ability to reduce both the severity and the duration of a common cold episode.

### Sufficiently important difference for common cold: severity reduction [^9c12507c]. Annals of Family Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose

We undertook a study to estimate the sufficiently important difference (SID) for the common cold. The SID is the smallest benefit that an intervention would require to justify costs and risks.

Methods

Benefit-harm tradeoff interviews (in-person and telephone) assessed SID in terms of overall severity reduction using evidence-based simple-language scenarios for 4 common cold treatments: vitamin C, the herbal medicine echinacea, zinc lozenges, and the unlicensed antiviral pleconaril.

Results

Response patterns to the 4 scenarios in the telephone and in-person samples were not statistically distinguishable and were merged for most analyses. The scenario based on vitamin C led to a mean SID of 25% (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.23–0.27). For the echinacea-based scenario, mean SID was 32% (95% CI, 0.30–0.34). For the zinc-based scenario, mean SID was 47% (95% CI, 0.43–0.51). The scenario based on preliminary antiviral trials provided a mean SID of 57% (95% CI, 0.53–0.61). Multivariate analyses suggested that (1) between-scenario differences were substantive and reproducible in the 2 samples, (2) presence or severity of illness did not predict SID, and (3) SID was not influenced by age, sex, tobacco use, ethnicity, income, or education. Despite consistencies supporting the model and methods, response patterns were diverse, with wide spreads of individual SID values within and among treatment scenarios.

Conclusions

Depending on treatment specifics, people want an on-average 25% to 57% reduction in overall illness severity to justify costs and risks of popular cold treatments. Randomized trial evidence does not support benefits this large. This model and these methods should be further developed for use in other disease entities.

### Common cold… [^643943fc]. publications.aap.org (2025). Medium credibility.

Key Points Counseling patients about the importance of good hand hygiene is the best way to prevent transmission of cold viruses. The only established safe and effective treatments for children are acetylcysteine, honey, nasal saline irrigation, intranasal ipratropium, and topical application of ointment containing camphor, menthol, and eucalyptus oils. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommended avoiding cough and cold medications in children younger than 6 years. Do not prescribe decongestants to children younger than 12 years, as evidence of the effectiveness of decongestants is limited, and they are associated with adverse effects.

### The common cold: the need for an effective treatment amid the FDA discussion on oral phenylephrine [^4f503c41]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2024). Medium credibility.

An episode of the common cold can have a significant negative impact on quality of life, mood, and daily activities. In line with this fact, there is a growing demand for health care and treatments associated with the common cold. Current treatments aim to (1) inhibit symptom severity and (2) shorten the duration of an episode of the common cold. These products include analgesics, antihistamines, and decongestants. In addition, various supplements, including vitamins, minerals, and herbs, are marketed to treat the common cold. The current products marketed for treating the common cold may reduce the severity of some (but not all) common cold symptoms, but they usually do not shorten the common cold episode. The recent indication that phenylephrine is not effective means that it will ultimately need to be removed from the over-the-counter monograph. Manufacturers will consequently need to reformulate their products and withdraw oral phenylephrine-containing products. Several newly developed common cold products are currently under investigation. These clinical trials should evaluate their efficacy and safety, as there remains a clear need for common cold products that significantly reduce both the symptom severity and the duration of episodes of the common cold.

### Complementary and integrative treatments: upper respiratory infection [^317a7f80]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

The combination of nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, sore throat, cough, and malaise is the symptomatic profile that constitutes an uncomplicated upper respiratory tract infection (URI), also known as the common cold. Because no known cure exists for a URI, numerous products are available, each marketed with the promise of alleviating the associated symptoms and/or shortening the duration of illness. The evidence supporting these claims is variable and is the focus of this article, with an emphasis on complementary and integrative therapies.

### Efficacy and safety of iota-carrageenan nasal spray versus placebo in early treatment of the common cold in adults: the ICICC trial [^eb583cfa]. Respiratory Research (2015). Low credibility.

Published clinical evidence concerning the frequencies of detectable viruses varies but with modern techniques, viruses (particularly rhinoviruses) have been found in up to 90% of patients suffering from cold symptoms. It can therefore be expected that in real-life conditions patients/consumers who empirically choose to use the I-C spray have a relatively high likelihood of being infected with rhinovirus or one of a variety of respiratory viruses that manifest with the common cold symptoms. The uncertainty of true infection in such a setting is counter-balanced by the very low intolerance and toxicity rates of the I-C spray and its relative inexpensiveness, thus giving favorable potential benefit-risk and benefit-cost ratios to the empiric use of the I-C spray.

In clinical trials of cough & cold, a substantial proportion of studies demonstrate trends but may not reach statistically significant efficacy outcomes. This observation may be due to the large variability in the disease severity between native infection and patients recruited in the early stages of a cold. When a controlled clinical trial tries to recruit patients at the earliest stages of a common cold - when symptoms are still emerging and are mild - patients may incorrectly believe they are coming down with a cold, prior to full blown cold symptoms. The relatively low frequency of rhinovirus-positive patients in the ICICC study demonstrates that there is often a trade-off when this standard design is used for cold studies. The peculiarities of the outcome of the ICICC study are also useful in that they may trigger a discussion among the scientific community about more suitable study designs to investigate common cold treatments.

Furthermore, the results of the ICICC study are in line with many other common cold studies which showed relatively small effects of treatment on symptom severity or duration. One example is the study by Barrett et al. on Echinacea which showed as well trends in the direction of benefit, amounting to an average half day reduction in the duration of a week-long cold, or an approximate 10% reduction in overall severity. The authors concluded that "while these results do not allow us to reject the null hypothesis and confidently claim evidence-of-benefit, data are also insufficient to exclude the possibility of a clinically significant effect".

Although not addressed in the ICICC trial, I-C's antiviral properties lead to speculation that its use might decrease cold transmission to patients' family members and other social contacts.

### Echinacea for treating the common cold: a randomized trial [^735aa21f]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Echinacea is widely used to treat the common cold.

Objective

To assess the potential benefits of echinacea as a treatment of common cold.

Design

Randomized, controlled trial. (ClinicalTrials.gov registration number: NCT00065715)

Setting

Dane County, Wisconsin.

Patients

719 patients, aged 12 to 80 years, with new-onset common cold.

Intervention

Patients were assigned to 1 of 4 parallel groups: no pills, placebo pills (blinded), echinacea pills (blinded), or echinacea pills (unblinded, open-label). Echinacea groups received the equivalent of 10.2 g of dried echinacea root during the first 24 hours and 5.1 g during each of the next 4 days. Indistinguishable placebo tablets contained only inert ingredients.

Measurements

The primary outcome was the area under the curve for global severity, with severity assessed twice daily by self-report using the Wisconsin Upper Respiratory Symptom Survey, short version. Secondary outcomes included interleukin-8 levels and neutrophil counts from nasal wash, assessed at intake and 2 days later.

Results

Of the 719 patients enrolled, 713 completed the protocol. Mean age was 33.7 years, 64% were female, and 88% were white. Mean global severity was 236 and 258 for the blinded and unblinded echinacea groups, respectively; 264 for the blinded placebo group; and 286 for the no-pill group. A comparison of the 2 blinded groups showed a 28-point trend (95% CI, -69 to 13 points) toward benefit for echinacea (P = 0.089). Mean illness duration in the blinded and unblinded echinacea groups was 6.34 and 6.76 days, respectively, compared with 6.87 days in the blinded placebo group and 7.03 days in the no-pill group. A comparison of the blinded groups showed a nonsignificant 0.53-day (CI, -1.25 to 0.19 days) benefit (P = 0.075). Median change in interleukin-8 levels and neutrophil counts were also not statistically significant (30 ng/L and 1 cell/high-power field [hpf] in the no-pill group, 39 ng/L and 1 cell/hpf in the blinded placebo group, 58 ng/L and 2 cells/hpf in the blinded echinacea group, and 70 ng/L and 1 cell/hpf in the open-label echinacea group).

Limitation

Higher-than-expected variability limited power to detect small benefits.

Conclusion

Illness duration and severity were not statistically significant with echinacea compared with placebo. These results do not support the ability of this dose of the echinacea formulation to substantively change the course of the common cold.

### Toxicity of over-the-counter cough and cold medications [^ae2f104b]. Pediatrics (2001). Low credibility.

Over-the-counter (OTC) cough and cold medications are marketed widely for relief of common cold symptoms, and yet studies have failed to demonstrate a benefit of these medications for young children. In addition, OTC medications can be associated with significant morbidity and even mortality in both acute overdoses and when administered in correct doses for chronic periods of time. Physicians often do not inquire about OTC medication use, and parents (or other caregivers) often do not perceive OTCs as medications. We present 3 cases of adverse outcomes over a 13-month period-including 1 death-as a result of OTC cough and cold medication use. We explore the toxicities of OTC cough and cold medications, discuss mechanisms of dosing errors, and suggest why physicians should be more vigilant in specifically inquiring about OTCs when evaluating an ill child.

Codeine use in children — Food and Drug Administration (FDA) safety communication and advisory panel actions are outlined as follows: On July 1, 2015, the FDA issued a drug safety communication investigating risks of codeine-containing medicines for coughs and colds in children younger than 18 years because of serious adverse effects, including slowed or difficult breathing. An FDA advisory panel met in December 2015 and, by an overwhelming majority vote, recommended that the use of codeine in the treatment of cough in all children up to 18 years of age should be contraindicated, with final agency action on this recommendation pending at this time; alternative therapies for cough have recently been reviewed.

### Treatment of naturally acquired common colds with zinc: a structured review [^91f7d4c5]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Over the past 20 years, the use of zinc as an over-the-counter alternative therapy for the common cold has vastly grown in popularity. Recent reports of potentially permanent anosmia caused by intranasal zinc therapy warrant careful analysis of the therapeutic effects of zinc.

Methods

A search of the Medline database (including articles published during 1966–2006) for studies of zinc and the common cold produced 105 published reports. Fourteen were randomized, placebo-controlled studies that examined the effect of zinc lozenges, nasal sprays, or nasal gels on naturally acquired common colds. Eleven features of experimental design affecting signal quality, chance, bias, and blinding were used to evaluate the 14 placebo-controlled studies. These criteria were validated case definition, quantifiable hypothesis, sample size calculation, randomized assignment, double blinding, proof of blinding, measurement of compliance, measurement of dropout rate, analysis by intent to treat, description of methods of analysis, and measurements of probability. Equal weight was given to each criterion, because failure to meet any one could potentially invalidate the findings of a clinical trial.

Results

Four studies met all 11 criteria. Three of these studies reported no therapeutic effect from zinc lozenge or nasal spray. One study reported positive results from zinc nasal gel. Of the remaining 10 studies, 6 reported a positive effect and 4 reported no effect. Intent-to-treat analysis was the most common criterion not met.

Conclusions

This structured review suggests that the therapeutic effectiveness of zinc lozenges has yet to be established. One well-designed study did report a positive effect of zinc nasal gel.

### Comprehensive evidence-based review on European antitussives [^334bcc19]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2016). Medium credibility.

Acute cough in common cold and acute bronchitis

A number of overlapping terms are used throughout the world to describe the clinical syndrome of acute viral upper respiratory tract infection (URTI). We suggest that the terminology below really describes different aspects of the same common syndrome.

The common cold is defined as an acute viral URTI, with symptoms of sore throat, sneezing, chilliness, nasal discharge, nasal obstruction, cough and malaise.

Acute cough, that is a cough arbitrarily defined as being of < 2 weeks duration, is one of the most common reasons for patient visits to ambulatory care.

Acute bronchitis is a clinical term implying a self-limited inflammation of the large airways of the lung that is characterised by cough without pneumonia, the latter being diagnosed by focal consolidation on examination or on chest X-ray.

It is now recognised that distinguishing between acute cough due to acute bronchitis and/or common cold is not practicable. Only slight pathological differences, if any, exist due to the principal localisation of viruses infecting the respiratory tract. Epidemiological surveys have shown that acute cough in otherwise healthy adults is a self-limiting disease with an average duration of the main symptom, cough of 14 days. In children, however, acute cough can last an average of 25 days.

Acute bronchitis is caused by viruses (∼50% rhinovirus infection) in at least 90% of cases. For these infections, no curative (antiviral) treatment exists and antibiotic therapy has been repeatedly shown to be ineffective in patients without pre-existing lung disease. Despite being a self-limiting disease, acute bronchitis poses both a high symptom burden to individuals and a high financial burden to society, mainly due to work and school absenteeism. Over 50% of new patient consultations to primary care are due to acute cough and up to 85% of cases are erroneously treated with antibiotics — with no impact on recovery. Apparent success is due to rapid spontaneous recovery and a huge placebo effect. Unnecessary and uncontrolled use of antibiotics in acute bronchitis contributes to an impending doom of antibiotic resistance.

### Saline nasal irrigation for acute upper respiratory tract infections [^cfa7155d]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Acute upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs), including the common cold and rhinosinusitis, are common afflictions that cause discomfort and debilitation, and contribute significantly to workplace absenteeism. Treatment is generally by antipyretic and mucolytic drugs, and often antibiotics, even though most infections are viral. Nasal irrigation with saline is often employed as an adjunct treatment for chronic or allergic sinusitis, but little is known about its effect on acute URTIs.

Objectives

To evaluate the efficacy of saline nasal irrigation in treating the symptoms of acute URTIs.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2009, issue 2) which contains the Acute Respiratory Infections (ARI) Group's Specialised Register, MEDLINE (1966 to May 2009), EMBASE (1974 to May 2009), CINAHL (1982 to May 2009), AMED (1985 to 2009) and LILACS (May 2009).

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing topical nasal saline treatment to other interventions in adults and children with clinically diagnosed acute URTIs.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors (DK, GS) independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. All data were analysed using Cochrane Review Manager software.

Main Results

Three RCTs (618 participants) were included. Most results showed no difference between nasal saline treatment and control. However, there was limited evidence of benefit with nasal saline irrigation in adults. One study showed a mean difference of 0.3 day (out of eight days) for symptom resolution, but this was not significant. Nasal saline irrigation was associated with less time off work in one study. Minor discomfort was not uncommon and 40% of babies did not tolerate nasal saline drops.

Authors' Conclusions

Included trials were too small and had too high a risk of bias to be confident about the possible benefits of nasal saline irrigation in acute URTIs. Future trials should involve much larger numbers of participants and be rigorously designed and controlled.

### Duration of symptoms of respiratory tract infections in children: systematic review [^06539264]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

Our review provides parents, clinicians, and policy makers with up-to-date evidence based estimates of the expected length of symptoms for children presenting with the most common respiratory tract infections in primary care and emergency department settings in high income countries: earache, sore throat, cough, and non-specific cold symptoms. These infections were selected because they are common and drive most primary care consultations and antibiotic prescribing for children in high income countries. We used data from systematic searches for both randomised controlled trials (placebo arms) and observational studies conducted in high income countries. For many symptoms of respiratory tract infection the data were highly heterogeneous in terms of age, definition of infection, outcome assessment, and duration of illness before study entry; however, our data provide the most robust estimates available.

For some symptoms of respiratory tract infections our estimates of duration are much longer than those currently used (table 8). For example, for earache (otitis media) we found that 90% of children are better by seven to eight days, which is considerably longer than the average duration of four days cited by the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence and two days cited by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In contrast, for some symptoms current estimates seem to overestimate the expected duration. We found that acute cough symptoms are better in 50% of children by 10 days, in contrast with the longer average duration of 21 days cited by National Institute for Health and Care Excellence. Finally, for other symptoms, the currently cited estimates of symptom duration match closely (or are slightly longer) with our finding — for example, for sore throat/tonsillitis we found that 90% are better by two to seven days, whereas National Institute for Health and Care Excellence and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention cite average durations of seven days and seven to 14 days, respectively. Similarly, the common cold seems to last from 10 (50% better) to 15 days (90% better), similar to advice from both National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (10–11 days) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (< 14 days).

### Efficacy of a yeast postbiotic on cold / flu symptoms in healthy children: a randomized-controlled trial [^ffc263e3]. Pediatric Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) are the most frequently reported health problems in children. Despite the common cold/flu being a self-limiting viral infection, visits to physicians, treatments, absenteeism from school or daycare as well as absenteeism of caregivers from work, contribute to a substantial economic burden. On average, children can have 7–10 cold/flu incidences per year, with higher incidences for children attending daycare or school. Cold/flu medications used to alleviate symptoms such as codeine, hydrocodone, and decongestants are not recommended for children and there is little evidence that over-the-counter (OTC) medications are effective for this age group. Further, overuse and misuse of antibiotics in pediatric populations is associated with growing antibiotic resistance and side effects, such as rash, diarrhea, and allergic reactions. Therefore, additional safe and efficacious solutions are needed to manage cold/flu and to decrease their incidence, severity, and duration in children.

Dietary supplements such as echinacea, zinc, elderberry, and β-glucan have been investigated for their effects on reducing or treating cold symptoms. However, there are inconsistencies in the findings or insufficient clinical evidence for these supplements demonstrating a beneficial effect in children. – A recent systematic review and meta-analysis reported that probiotics may reduce the incidence of acute URTIs in children, however, effects on the duration or severity of cold symptoms were not reported. Overall, not much is known about the safety of these supplements in children with only a limited number of published studies in the pediatric population.

Furthermore, accumulating evidence suggests that the viability of microorganisms included in probiotics are not essential for eliciting beneficial effects on human health. Administration of compounds composed of non-viable micro-organisms often with their metabolites, commonly known as postbiotics, offers safety advantages over probiotics, as there is no risk of intestinal translocation, bacterial resistance, or worsening of local inflammation. Given these advantages, postbiotic supplementation may be a promising alternative for reducing the incidence of infectious diseases in pediatric populations. EpiCor postbiotic has been demonstrated to improve immune function in healthy adults, lessening the impact or incidence of cold/flu-like or allergy symptoms. – However, the effects of postbiotic supplementation on immune function in the developing immune systems of children are not well understood. The objective of this study was to investigate the efficacy and safety of 84-day supplementation of EpiCor on the incidence of cold/flu symptoms among children aged 4–12 years.

### Managing chronic cough as a symptom in children and management algorithms: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^3220cad3]. Chest (2020). High credibility.

Over-the-counter (OTC) cough medications and pediatric acute/chronic cough: Manufacturers re-labeled these OTC products "do not use in children under 4 years of age", and in 2018 FDA labeling for prescription opioid cough and cold medicines was changed to limit their use to adults ≥ 18 years. OTC cough medications have little, if any, benefit in symptomatic control of acute cough in children and preparations containing anti-histamine and dextromethorphan were associated with adverse events, including reported death from toxicity in young children. CHEST advises that OTC use for chronic cough in children is the same as for acute cough due to the common cold. Consensus statements: 38) For children with acute cough, we suggest that the use of over the counter cough and cold medicines should not be prescribed until they have been shown to make cough less severe or resolve sooner; 39) For children with acute cough, we suggest that honey may offer more relief for cough symptoms than no treatment, diphenhydramine, or placebo, but it is not better than dextromethorphan; 40) For children with acute cough, we suggest avoiding using codeine-containing medications because of the potential for serious side effects including respiratory distress.

### Ipratropium bromide [^df1563c2]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

For Symptomatic Relief of Rhinorrhea Associated with the Common Cold

The recommended dose of ipratropium bromide nasal solution, 0.06% is two sprays (84 mcg) per nostril three or four times daily (total dose 504 to 672 mcg/day) in adults and children age 12 years and older. Optimum dosage varies with response of the individual patient. The recommended dose of ipratropium bromide nasal solution, 0.06% for children age 5 to11 years is two sprays (84 mcg) per nostril three times daily (total dose of 504 mcg/day).

The safety and effectiveness of the use of ipratropium bromide nasal solution, 0.06% beyond four days in patients with the common cold have not been established.

For Symptomatic Relief of Rhinorrhea Associated with Seasonal Allergic Rhinitis

The recommended dose of ipratropium bromide nasal solution, 0.06% is two sprays (84 mcg) per nostril four times daily (total dose 672 mcg/day) in adults and children age 5 years and older.

The safety and effectiveness of the use of ipratropium bromide nasal solution, 0.06% beyond three weeks in patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis have not been established.

Initial pump priming requires seven sprays of the pump. If used regularly as recommended, no further priming is required. If not used for more than 24 hours, the pump will require two sprays, or if not used for more than seven days, the pump will require seven sprays to reprime. Avoid spraying into eyes.

### Chronic cough due to acute bronchitis: ACCP evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^a064477c]. Chest (2006). Low credibility.

Background

The purpose of this review is to present the evidence for the diagnosis and treatment of cough due to acute bronchitis and make recommendations that will be useful for clinical practice. Acute bronchitis is one of the most common diagnoses made by primary care clinicians and emergency department physicians. It is an acute respiratory infection with a normal chest radiograph that is manifested by cough with or without phlegm production that lasts for up to 3 weeks. Respiratory viruses appear to be the most common cause of acute bronchitis; however, the organism responsible is rarely identified in clinical practice because viral cultures and serologic assays are not routinely performed. Fewer than 10% of patients will have a bacterial infection diagnosed as the cause of bronchitis. The diagnosis of acute bronchitis should be made only when there is no clinical or radiographic evidence of pneumonia, and the common cold, acute asthma, or an exacerbation of COPD have been ruled out as the cause of cough. Acute bronchitis is a self-limited respiratory disorder, and when the cough persists for > 3 weeks, other diagnoses must be considered.

Methods

Recommendations for this review were obtained from data using a National Library of Medicine (PubMed) search dating back to 1950, which was performed in August 2004. The search was limited to literature published in the English language and human studies, using search terms such as "cough", "acute bronchitis", and "acute viral respiratory infection".

Results

Unfortunately, most previous controlled trials guiding the treatment of acute bronchitis have not vigorously differentiated acute bronchitis and the common cold, and also have not distinguished between an acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis and acute asthma as a cause of acute cough. For patients with the putative diagnosis of acute bronchitis, routine treatment with antibiotics is not justified and should not be offered. Antitussive agents are occasionally useful and can be offered as therapy for short-term symptomatic relief of coughing, but there is no role for inhaled bronchodilator or expectorant therapy. Children and adult patients with confirmed and probable whooping cough should receive a macrolide antibiotic and should be isolated for 5 days from the start of treatment; early treatment within the first few weeks will diminish the coughing paroxysms and prevent spread of the disease; the patient is unlikely to respond to treatment beyond this period.

Conclusion

Acute bronchitis is an acute respiratory infection that is manifested by cough and, at times, sputum production that lasts for no more than 3 weeks. This syndrome should be distinguished from the common cold, an acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis, and acute asthma as the cause of acute cough. The widespread use of antibiotics for the treatment of acute bronchitis is not justified, and vigorous efforts to curtail their use should be encouraged.

### Echinacea for preventing and treating the common cold [^85f7275f]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Echinacea plant preparations (family Asteraceae) are widely used in Europe and North America for common colds. Most consumers and physicians are not aware that products available under the term Echinacea differ appreciably in their composition, mainly due to the use of variable plant material, extraction methods and the addition of other components.

Objectives

To assess whether there is evidence that Echinacea preparations are effective and safe compared to placebo in the prevention and treatment of the common cold.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL 2013, Issue 5, MEDLINE (1946 to May week 5, 2013), EMBASE (1991 to June 2013), CINAHL (1981 to June 2013), AMED (1985 to February 2012), LILACS (1981 to June 2013), Web of Science (1955 to June 2013), CAMBASE (no time limits), the Centre for Complementary Medicine Research (1988 to September 2007), WHO ICTRP and clinicaltrials.gov (last searched 5 June 2013), screened references and asked experts in the field about published and unpublished studies.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing mono-preparations of Echinacea with placebo.

Data Collection and Analysis

At least two review authors independently assessed eligibility and trial quality and extracted data. The primary efficacy outcome was the number of individuals with at least one cold in prevention trials and the duration of colds in treatment trials. For all included trials the primary safety and acceptability outcome was the number of participants dropping out due to adverse events. We assessed trial quality using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool.

Main Results

Twenty-four double-blind trials with 4631 participants including a total of 33 comparisons of Echinacea preparations and placebo met the inclusion criteria. A variety of different Echinacea preparations based on different species and parts of plant were used. Evidence from seven trials was available for preparations based on the aerial parts of Echinacea purpurea. Ten trials were considered to have a low risk of bias, six to have an unclear risk of bias and eight to have a high risk of bias. Ten trials with 13 comparisons investigated prevention and 15 trials with 20 comparisons investigated treatment of colds (one trial addressed both prevention and treatment). Due to the strong clinical heterogeneity of the studies we refrained from pooling for the main analysis. None of the 12 prevention comparisons reporting the number of patients with at least one cold episode found a statistically significant difference. However a post hoc pooling of their results, suggests a relative risk reduction of 10% to 20%. Of the seven treatment trials reporting data on the duration of colds, only one showed a significant effect of Echinacea over placebo. The number of patients dropping out or reporting adverse effects did not differ significantly between treatment and control groups in prevention and treatment trials. However, in prevention trials there was a trend towards a larger number of patients dropping out due to adverse events in the treatment groups.

Authors' Conclusions

Echinacea products have not here been shown to provide benefits for treating colds, although, it is possible there is a weak benefit from some Echinacea products: the results of individual prophylaxis trials consistently show positive (if non-significant) trends, although potential effects are of questionable clinical relevance.

### Efficacy of a carrageenan nasal spray in patients with common cold: a randomized controlled trial [^0d152ddc]. Respiratory Research (2013). Low credibility.

Due to the physical mechanism of action of carrageenan, it is unlikely that patients with cold symptoms not caused by a virus would have an added benefit in comparison to placebo treatment with a saline nasal solution. Treatment of common colds with saline nasal irrigation has been discussed to have a clinical benefit and has been described to be associated with less time off work. Consequently, the current study is limited by the fact that the placebo nasal spray containing a saline nasal solution most likely has caused a clinical benefit as well. This could explain why no significant effect on the primary endpoint in the ITT population was observed in this trial in contrast to the virus positive population that comprised 58% virus positive patients.

A recent study in children with a similar design revealed a significant reduction of time to disease clearance of 1.8 days in the ITT population comparable to this study. In that children trial around 90% of the children were tested virus-positive and hence there was negligible difference between the ITT and the ITT-VP population, although also in this study the ITT-VP population experienced a stronger effect of treatment with carrageenan. It can be assumed that both, adults and children infected with common cold viruses will benefit from local application of carrageenan in a similar way. In adults, the effect on disease duration might be masked by patients with cold symptoms not caused by viral infections. However, the faster rate of symptom reduction in all iota-carrageenan treated adults suggests that all patients with cold symptoms will have an added benefit when compared with a standard saline nasal spray that served as a placebo in the trial.

Analysis of TSS showed faster symptom improvement in carrageenan treated patients during the second phase of disease with statistically significant differences in the ITT-VP and PP-VP groups. In addition, the break point (representing changes in course of disease and start of recovery) was earlier in the ITT-VP and PP-VP in carrageenan patients. The applied ReWuMod method allows the evaluation of different courses of disease independent of absolute values. This was of particular interest as absolute values depend on different pathogens and subjective patient assessment. No significant difference in TSS between carrageenan and placebo groups was observed in the first 3 days of the study. However, carrageenan treated patients experienced a significantly earlier improvement in disease symptoms. Furthermore, the rate of symptom reduction per day was approximately doubled. It can therefore be concluded that the significant reduction in time to disease clearance was achieved by a faster decrease of symptoms visible on day 4 after inclusion.

### Codeine versus placebo for chronic cough in children [^55024709]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Cough in children is a commonly experienced symptom that is associated with increased health service utilisation and burden to parents. The presence of chronic (equal to or more than four weeks) cough in children may indicate a serious underlying condition such as inhaled foreign body or bronchiectasis. Codeine (and derivative)-based medications are sometimes used to treat cough due to their antitussive properties. However, there are inherent risks associated with the use of these medications such as respiratory drive suppression, anaesthetic-induced anaphylaxis, and addiction. Metabolic response and dosage variability place children at increased risk of experiencing such side effects. A systematic review evaluating the quality of the available literature would be useful to inform management practices.

Objectives

To evaluate the safety and efficacy of codeine (and derivatives) in the treatment of chronic cough in children.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Register of Trials, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (1946 to 8 June 2016), EMBASE (1974 to 8 June 2016), the online trials registries of the World Health Organization and ClinicalTrials.gov, and the bibliographic references of publications. We imposed no language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

We considered studies eligible for analysis when: the participant population included children aged less than 18 years with chronic cough (duration equal to or more than four weeks at the time of intervention); and the study design evaluated codeine or codeine-based derivatives against placebo through a randomised controlled trial.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened the search results to determine eligibility against a standardised criteria, and we had a pre-planned method for analysis.

Main Results

We identified a total of 556 records, of which 486 records were excluded on the basis of title and abstract. We retrieved the remaining 70 references in full to determine eligibility. No studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria of this review, and thus we found no evidence to support or oppose the use of codeine or derivatives as antitussive agents for chronic cough in children. While chronic cough is not the same as acute cough, systematic reviews on the use of codeine efficacy for acute cough in children conclude an overall lack of evidence to support or oppose the use of over-the-counter cough and cold medications containing codeine (or derivatives) for treatment of acute cough in children. The lack of sufficient evidence to support the use of these medications has been consistently reaffirmed by medical experts in international chronic cough guidelines and by governing medical and pharmaceutical authorities in the USA, Europe, Canada, New Zealand, and Australia. Due to the lack of sufficient evidence to support efficacy, and the known risks associated with use - in particular the increased risks for children - these medications are now not recommended for children less than 12 years of age and children between 12 to 18 years with respiratory conditions.

Authors' Conclusions

This review has highlighted the absence of any randomised controlled trials evaluating codeine-based medications in the treatment of childhood chronic cough. Given the potential adverse events of respiratory suppression and opioid toxicity, national therapeutic regulatory authorities recommend the contraindication of access to codeine in children less than 12 years of age. We suggest that clinical practice adhere to clinical practice guidelines and thus refrain from using codeine or its derivatives to treat cough in children. Aetiological-based management practices continue to be advocated for children with chronic cough.

### Zinc supplementation reduces common cold duration among healthy adults: a systematic review of randomized controlled trials with micronutrients supplementation [^903d5261]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Medium credibility.

Data extraction and risk assessment.

Key characteristics and relevant outcome information were extracted from selected studies using a standardized data abstraction sheet and are summarized in Table 2. The corresponding authors of included studies were contacted for information or clarification when required. When available, the number of cold episodes, mean duration, and severity of cold episodes were evaluated as the main outcomes of this review. For studies reporting both data for self-reported colds and clinically diagnosed or laboratory-confirmed colds, only data for clinically diagnosed or laboratory-confirmed colds were recorded. For dichotomous outcomes, the number of cold outcomes and cold episodes in the intervention and placebo groups were collected. For continuous outcomes, means and SDs in duration and severity of common cold episodes in the intervention and placebo groups were collected. When these data were not reported or available after contacting authors, methods outlined in the Cochrane handbook to calculate SDs from CIs and P -values were used. When studies reported only median and interquartile range (IQR), the median was used to reflect the mean and the IQR was divided by 1.35 to obtain the SD.

Table 2
Study characteristics

The risk of bias in included studies was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. The certainty of evidence for each outcome was also assessed using the GRADE approach (GRADE). The approach examines the trials included for each outcome on the grounds of 1) study design; 2) risk of bias; 3) inconsistency, indirectness, and imprecision in outcome measures; and 4) the presence of publication bias, large effect magnitude, plausible confounding, and dose-response gradient, to determine the level of confidence in the summary statistic through discussion between reviewers.

Study selection, data extraction, and risk of bias assessment were performed in duplicate by the two reviewers (M. X. W. and S. S. W.). Discrepancies were discussed and resolved by consensus at the end of each procedure with a third reviewer (J. P.).

### Ipratropium bromide [^3989927e]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Pediatric Use

The safety ofipratropium bromide nasal solution, 0.06% at a dose of two sprays (84 mcg) per nostril three times a day (total dose 504 mcg/day) for two to four days has been demonstrated in two clinical trials involving 362 pediatric patients 5 to 11 years of age with naturally acquired common colds. In this pediatric population ipratropium bromide nasal solution, 0.06% had an adverse event profile similar to that observed in adolescent and adult patients. When ipratropium bromide nasal solution, 0.06% was concomitantly administered with an oral decongestant (pseudoephedrine HCI) in 122 children ages 5 to 12 years, and concomitantly administered with an oral decongestant/antihistamine combination (pseudoephedrine HCI/chlorpheniramine maleate) in 123 children ages 5 to 12 years, adverse event profiles were similar to ipratropium bromide nasal solution, 0.06% alone. The safety of ipratropium bromide nasal solution, 0.06% at a dose of two sprays (84 mcg) per nostril four times a day (total dose 672 mcg/day) for three weeks in pediatric seasonal allergic rhinitis patients down to 5 years is based upon the safety demonstrated in the pediatric common cold trials and the trial in adult and adolescent patients 12 to 75 years of age with seasonal allergic rhinitis. The effectiveness of ipratropium bromide nasal solution, 0.06% for the treatment of rhinorrhea associated with the common cold and seasonal allergic rhinitis in this pediatric age group is based on extrapolation of the demonstrated efficacy of ipratropium bromide nasal solution, 0.06% in adolescents and adults with the conditions and the likelihood that the disease course, pathophysiology, and the drug's effects are substantially similar to that of adults. The recommended dose for common cold for the pediatric population is based on cross-study comparisons of the efficacy of ipratropium bromide nasal solution, 0.06% in adult and pediatric patients and on its safety profile in both adults and pediatric common cold patients. The recommended dose for seasonal allergic rhinitis for the pediatric population down to 5 years is based upon the efficacy and safety of ipratropium bromide nasal solution, 0.06% in adults and adolescents 12 years of age and above with seasonal allergic rhinitis and the safety profile of this dose in both adult and pediatric common cold patients. The safety and effectiveness of ipratropium bromide nasal solution, 0.06% in pediatric patients under 5 years of age have not been established.

### Clinical policy for well-appearing infants and children younger than 2 years of age presenting to the emergency department with fever [^75ae3348]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

Translation of classes of evidence to recommendation levels — strength of recommendations regarding each critical question is based on evidence grading, expert opinion, and consensus, with Level A recommendations reflecting a high degree of clinical certainty (eg, based on evidence from 1 or more Class of Evidence I or multiple Class of Evidence II studies), Level B recommendations identifying strategies that reflect moderate clinical certainty (eg, based on evidence from 1 or more Class of Evidence II studies or strong consensus of Class of Evidence III studies), and Level C recommendations based on Class of Evidence III studies or, in the absence of adequate published literature, expert consensus, with "consensus" placed in parentheses at the end of the recommendation; recommendations may be downgraded because of heterogeneity of results, uncertainty about effect magnitude and consequences, and publication bias, and, when possible, clinically oriented statistics such as likelihood ratios (LRs) and number needed to treat are presented.

### Evaluation of echinacea for the prevention and treatment of the common cold: a meta-analysis [^f09751cd]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2007). Medium credibility.

Echinacea is one of the most commonly used herbal products, but controversy exists about its benefit in the prevention and treatment of the common cold. Thus, we did a meta-analysis evaluating the effect of echinacea on the incidence and duration of the common cold. 14 unique studies were included in the meta-analysis. Incidence of the common cold was reported as an odds ratio (OR) with 95% CI, and duration of the common cold was reported as the weighted mean difference (WMD) with 95% CI. Weighted averages and mean differences were calculated by a random-effects model (DerSimonian-Laird methodology). Heterogeneity was assessed by the Q statistic and review of L'Abbé plots, and publication bias was assessed through the Egger weighted regression statistic and visual inspection of funnel plots. Echinacea decreased the odds of developing the common cold by 58% (OR 0.42; 95% CI 0.25–0.71; Q statistic p < 0.001) and the duration of a cold by 1.4 days (WMD -1.44, -2.24 to -0.64; p = 0.01). Similarly, significant reductions were maintained in subgroup analyses limited to Echinaguard/Echinacin use, concomitant supplement use, method of cold exposure, Jadad scores less than 3, or use of a fixed-effects model. Published evidence supports echinacea's benefit in decreasing the incidence and duration of the common cold.

### Cough [^f5909817]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

The management of cough in children should be etiologically based. This requires that all children with cough should be carefully evaluated and managed differently than adults because the etiologic factors and treatment in children are significantly different than that in adults. In all children with cough, exacerbation factors should be sought and intervention options for cessation advised or initiated. Parental expectations and specific concerns should also be sought and addressed.

### Echinacea for preventing and treating the common cold [^9020ab4c]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Preparations of the plant Echinacea (family Compositae) are widely used in some European countries and in North America for common colds. Most consumers and physicians are not aware that products available under the term Echinacea differ appreciably in their composition, mainly due to the use of variable plant material, extraction methods and addition of other components.

Objectives

The objective of this review was to assess whether there is evidence that Echinacea preparations are 1) more effective than no treatment; 2) more effective than placebo; 3) similarly effective to other treatments in A) the prevention and B) the treatment of the common cold.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library Issue 3, 2005); PubMed (1997 to April 2005), EMBASE (1998 to June 2005), AMED (to August 2005), Centre for Complementary Medicine Research (in Munich) (1988 to May 2005), contacted experts, and screened references of reviews.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials that compared mono-preparations of Echinacea with a placebo, no treatment, or another treatment for the prevention or treatment of common colds. Trials on combinations of Echinacea and other herbs were excluded.

Data Collection and Analysis

For all studies, at least two authors independently assessed eligibility and trial quality, and extracted data. Outcomes of interest in prevention trials were: numbers of individuals with one or more colds, and severity and duration of colds; and in treatment trials: total symptom scores, nasal symptoms, and duration of colds.

Main Results

Sixteen trials including a total of 22 comparisons of an Echinacea preparation and a control group (19 with placebo, 2 with no treatment, 1 with another herbal preparation) met the inclusion criteria. All trials except one were described as double-blind. The majority had reasonable to good methodological quality. Three comparisons investigated prevention of colds and 19 comparisons tested treatment of colds. A variety of different Echinacea preparations were used. None of the three comparisons in the prevention trials showed an effect over placebo. Comparing an Echinacea preparation with placebo as treatment, a significant effect was reported in nine comparisons, a trend in one, and no difference in six. More than one trial was available only for preparations based on the aerial parts from Echinacea purpurea (E. purpurea).

Authors' Conclusions

Echinacea preparations tested in clinical trials differ greatly. There is some evidence that preparations based on the aerial parts of Echinacea purpurea might be effective for the early treatment of colds in adults but results are not fully consistent. Beneficial effects of other Echinacea preparations, and for preventative purposes might exist but have not been shown in independently replicated, rigorous randomized trials.

### Therapeutic principles and unmet needs in the treatment of cough in pediatric patients: review and expert survey [^853400cb]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Cough is a highly prevalent symptom in children of all ages and in different regions of the world. Pediatric cough is most commonly caused by acute viral respiratory tract infection, though it can be triggered by numerous conditions including bacterial infection, allergic response, and asthma. Pediatric cough has a major impact on sleep, school performance, and the ability to play and, therefore, has a negative influence on children's quality of life. Pediatric cough is also a source of stress and anxiety for parents, due to its impact on children's behavior (e.g. refusing food) and sleep patterns, and the often unwarranted fear that it will escalate into a more serious health condition. Thus, pediatric cough is a major driver to seek medical attention, and is associated with high costs resulting from physician visits, diagnostic tests, and medications, thereby placing a high burden on healthcare systems.

Various local, national, and international organizations have developed clinical practice guidelines in order to standardize the treatment of cough in adults and/or children. However, these guidelines vary in quality, and recommendations are often based on low-quality evidence (observational studies or expert consensus, as opposed to randomized controlled trials [RCTs]). Cough is a symptom of multiple diseases and, therefore, is managed by a variety of disciplines. Furthermore, while guidelines for adults outnumber those for children, adult guidelines do not translate well to children. Overall, there are evidence gaps in the management of pediatric cough, particularly for acute pediatric cough. The aims of this study were to identify and present therapeutic principles and unmet needs in the treatment of cough in pediatric patients, at an international level, and to consider the clinical studies required to address these unmet needs. The aims are addressed through a review of current literature on pediatric cough, and expert opinion collected using a questionnaire.

### Echinacea for prevention of the common cold: an illustrative overview of how information from different systematic reviews is summarised on the internet [^4483f660]. Preventive Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Objectives

Three systematic reviews of echinacea for the prevention of colds have somewhat different conclusions. Our study objectives were to illustrate how selection criteria for trials in each of the reviews could lead to different conclusions, and to classify the ways in which webpage authors use the reviews to construct advice about echinacea.

Methods

A funnel plot was constructed of all treatment comparisons in the primary trials included in the reviews. A World Wide Web search was undertaken using five major search engines in order to locate webpages that referred to the efficacy of echinacea in cold prevention and also referred to each of the reviews.

Results

Twelve webpages were located. Three webpages presented findings from all three reviews; five presented findings from one or two; four used all three reviews as general supporting references. Views about efficacy differed. There were few comments about the sources of heterogeneity between reviews.

Conclusions

Given the residual uncertainty and the gaps between the evidence and the ways that this is summarised on webpages, it may prove difficult for consumers to assimilate the evidence. As well as undertaking high-quality trials in complementary medicine, we also need to ensure precision in the reporting of uncertainty.

### Natural alternatives and the common cold and influenza [^af7d5b47]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

The use of complementary and integrative medicine has increased. It is estimated that one-third of the population of the United States uses some form of alternative medicine. Physicians should consider integrative medicine therapies. Alternative medical therapies for the common cold and influenza include herbal supplements, dietary supplements, diet, and other adjunct therapies. However, it is important to research and study these therapies. Therefore, communication with patients and other health care providers is important. This will ensure effective and positive patient care experiences. Further randomized clinical trials are necessary to further establish the role of various alternative options.

### Efficacy of a carrageenan nasal spray in patients with common cold: a randomized controlled trial [^59ce0945]. Respiratory Research (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Acute viral respiratory tract infection (ARTI), also known as the common cold, is the most prevalent disease in humans. In the USA alone, non-influenza colds annually account for more than 20 million doctor visits and 40 million lost school and work days. With a total economic impact of approximately $40 billion, ARTI is among the ten most expensive illnesses in society.

In the majority of cases, common colds are caused by respiratory viruses such as rhinovirus, coronavirus, parainfluenza, influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, enterovirus, or metapneumovirus.

The number of etiological agents and antigenic variability has limited the possibility of creating an effective vaccine against the common cold. Numerous attempts to find effective prophylactic or therapeutic treatments including pharmaceutical and herbal products, vitamins, zinc and others have provided controversial results and are not considered effective when systematically reviewed.

Presently, therapy for the common cold mainly includes general care and treatment of symptoms. While these measures reduce symptoms, therapeutic interventions to date have not been proven to be effective in reducing viral load or the duration or severity of common colds.

The concept of using sulphated polysaccharides as antiviral agents was introduced more than 25 years ago. Due to the high molecular weight of polymers, parenteral administration is not feasible. For the treatment of sexually transmitted diseases, research has focused on topical microbicide development although not enough evidence has accumulated to recommend these agents at present. However, these polysaccharides have been tested to prevent sexually transmitted viral infections as a component of spermicides.

Recently it was shown that iota-carrageenan, a sulphated polysaccharide found in some species of red seaweed, is a potent antiviral agent against respiratory viruses in cell culture and animal models. Laboratory data show that the carrageenan-polymer binds directly to the virus but not to cells trapping the particle and preventing cell attachment. Thus, carrageenan interferes with the virus life cycle at a very early stage due to a physical mechanism of action. Studies in vitro and in vivo have shown the effectiveness of carrageenan against several viruses such as hRV, influenza A and RSV. Tests in vitro have shown that carrageenan does not penetrate the mucosa. Therefore, pharmacological, immunological or metabolic activities of carrageenan are not to be expected.
