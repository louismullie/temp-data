## Question

CEA marker is indicated for?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the clinical indications for carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) testing. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core clinical contexts where CEA is used. Then, I should verify the strength of evidence and guideline support for each indication. Next, I will examine diagnostic performance, thresholds, and limitations. After that, I should consider special populations and non-colorectal cancers. Finally, I will synthesize a concise, prioritized list of indications with caveats and monitoring recommendations.

> Let me first confirm the primary clinical contexts. CEA is most consistently used in colorectal cancer for preoperative prognostication, postoperative surveillance for recurrence, and treatment response monitoring in metastatic disease, with additional roles in select non-colorectal settings such as mucinous ovarian tumors and, to a lesser extent, lung and medullary thyroid cancers, though the evidence base varies by disease and indication [^f9dda7f4] [^6de73f57] [^d1c63b77] [^cc1cc2f2] [^32928cda].

> I will now examine preoperative prognostication in colorectal cancer. Wait, let me verify the magnitude of prognostic impact. Multiple high-quality guidelines and large cohort analyses show that elevated preoperative CEA independently predicts worse overall survival and recurrence risk, with hazard ratios around 1.4–1.6 for modest elevations and higher for marked elevations, and this informs baseline risk stratification and surgical planning [^f9dda7f4] [^6de73f57] [^d98e7a73]. Hold on, I should also note that while preoperative CEA is prognostic, it is not a stand-alone determinant of adjuvant therapy decisions, which still hinge on pathologic stage and clinical judgment [^notfound].

> Next, I should review postoperative surveillance. The NCCN and ASCO recommend serial CEA measurements every 3–6 months for about 2–3 years and then every 6–12 months up to 5 years in patients who are candidates for curative-intent treatment of recurrence, recognizing that CEA alone is insufficiently sensitive and must be paired with imaging and clinical assessment [^2df51410] [^0c576bfc]. I need to check the diagnostic performance at common thresholds; at a 10 ng/mL cutoff, pooled sensitivity is about 68% and specificity about 97%, meaning roughly one-third of recurrences are missed and false positives cluster in the 5–15 ng/mL range, which is why trends and confirmatory imaging are essential [^22505aa9] [^d96a0d0b]. But wait, what if CEA is rising and CT is negative? In that scenario, PET/CT can be considered given its high sensitivity for recurrence, though guidelines caution against routine PET/CT surveillance and against blind CEA-directed surgery when imaging is negative [^de35889d] [^6142e240].

> I should confirm the role in metastatic disease monitoring. CEA is the marker of choice to track systemic therapy response in metastatic colorectal cancer, with serial changes correlating with radiographic response and survival; however, I need to ensure we interpret kinetics carefully because CEA flare can occur early with effective therapy and should not be mistaken for progression without imaging confirmation [^8b5711ee] [^855ec322]. Hold on, I should verify that CEA is not used to declare progression in isolation; indeed, rising CEA should prompt imaging rather than automatic treatment changes, given nonspecific elevations and the risk of overtreatment [^c9381b96].

> Let me consider special populations and non-colorectal cancers. In mucinous ovarian tumors, elevated CEA can suggest a gastrointestinal primary and may aid surveillance; a CA-125:CEA ratio greater than 25 supports an ovarian source, though this is adjunctive rather than definitive [^d1c63b77] [^f7eaf874]. In early-stage non-small cell lung cancer, postoperative CEA has been explored for risk stratification, but evidence is limited and not practice-changing; I should be cautious not to overstate its role here [^cc1cc2f2]. In medullary thyroid carcinoma, CEA can be elevated and trend with disease burden, but calcitonin remains the primary marker; CEA may be supportive in select cases [^32928cda] [^3aa1cb56].

> I need to ensure I address limitations and confounders. CEA is nonspecific and can be elevated in smokers, liver disease, pancreatitis, inflammatory bowel disease, and other benign conditions, which explains frequent false positives in the 5–15 ng/mL range and underscores the need to interpret values in clinical context and confirm isolated rises before escalating workup [^802f5412] [^6142e240]. Hmm, wait a minute, I almost implied that a CEA above 35 ng/mL is diagnostic of recurrence; I should correct that — while values above 35 ng/mL are highly specific for recurrence in post-resection patients, they are not absolutely diagnostic and still require imaging confirmation before declaring recurrence or initiating treatment [^6142e240].

> Next, I should review comparative and emerging surveillance strategies. Randomized and observational data show that intensive CEA and/or CT surveillance can detect recurrences earlier and increase curative-intent resections, but randomized trials have not consistently demonstrated an overall survival benefit, so shared decision-making is important when balancing intensity, costs, and patient preferences [^fa0f27c9] [^65a87637]. Let me double-check ctDNA data; prospective cohorts suggest ctDNA does not clearly outperform standard imaging plus CEA for early recurrence detection, so ctDNA should not replace guideline-concordant surveillance outside trials at this time [^82361d2c] [^e26d7ed2].

> I will now synthesize the indications succinctly. CEA is indicated for colorectal cancer in three principal ways: establish a preoperative baseline for prognostication and future surveillance, conduct postoperative surveillance for recurrence in conjunction with imaging and clinical assessment, and monitor treatment response in metastatic disease; adjunctive roles include helping distinguish mucinous ovarian primaries from colorectal metastases and supporting surveillance in select non-colorectal cancers where CEA is known to reflect tumor burden, always interpreted in context and confirmed with imaging when rising [^f9dda7f4] [^6de73f57] [^22505aa9] [^d1c63b77] [^32928cda].

> Finally, I should confirm practical thresholds and actions. A CEA above 10 ng/mL in the postoperative setting warrants prompt imaging and clinical evaluation, whereas values in the 5–15 ng/mL range should be confirmed with repeat testing and trend analysis before escalation; if CEA rises and high-quality CT is negative, PET/CT can be considered, but blind laparotomy or laparoscopy based on CEA alone is not recommended [^c9381b96] [^de35889d] [^22505aa9]. Hold on, I should verify duration; routine CEA surveillance is generally discontinued after 5 years given diminishing yield, aligning with guideline endpoints and evolving evidence on cost-effectiveness and patient-centered care [^e492533d].

CEA is indicated for **postoperative surveillance** of colorectal cancer [^22505aa9] to detect recurrence early, with measurements every 3–6 months for 2–3 years and then annually for up to 5 years [^notfound]. It is also used to **monitor treatment response** in metastatic colorectal cancer [^8b5711ee], where rising CEA suggests progression and falling CEA suggests response. CEA is not recommended for screening or diagnosis because of low sensitivity and specificity [^d96a0d0b] [^802f5412], and false positives can occur in smokers and with liver disease, so results must be interpreted in clinical context [^6142e240] [^802f5412].

## Clinical indications for CEA testing

### Colorectal cancer (CRC)

#### Preoperative assessment

Preoperative CEA establishes a **baseline** for prognosis and future surveillance [^f9dda7f4]; elevated preoperative CEA is associated with worse outcomes and higher recurrence risk [^d98e7a73].

---

#### Postoperative surveillance

Postoperative surveillance entails **regular CEA monitoring** every 3–6 months for 2–3 years, then annually up to 5 years [^2df51410], to detect recurrence early [^fa0f27c9]. CEA has moderate sensitivity and high specificity for recurrence; trends improve accuracy over single values [^d96a0d0b] [^67a1a7c3].

---

#### Monitoring treatment response

In metastatic CRC, serial CEA tracks **response**; rising CEA suggests progression, while falling CEA suggests response [^8b5711ee] [^a7ae7945].

---

### Other cancers

CEA may be elevated in lung, breast, gastric, pancreatic, and medullary thyroid cancers, but it is **not specific** and is not used for screening or diagnosis in these settings [^802f5412] [^37579ce5]. In mucinous ovarian tumors, CEA can help distinguish metastatic GI primaries from primary ovarian cancer and may aid surveillance [^d1c63b77] [^f7eaf874].

---

## Limitations and considerations

- **False positives**: Smoking, liver disease, and inflammation can elevate CEA [^802f5412] [^6142e240].
- **False negatives**: Some CRCs do not produce CEA, so normal levels do not exclude recurrence [^d96a0d0b] [^bdcf2796].
- **Not for screening**: CEA is not recommended for population screening or initial diagnosis due to low sensitivity and specificity [^d96a0d0b] [^802f5412].

## Summary of CEA indications

| **Clinical context** | **Indication** | **Frequency** |
|-|-|-|
| Colorectal cancer | Preoperative baseline | Once before surgery |
| Colorectal cancer | Postoperative surveillance | Every 3–6 months for 2–3 years, then annually for up to 5 years |
| Metastatic colorectal cancer | Treatment monitoring | Serial measurements during therapy |
| Mucinous ovarian tumors | Differentiation and surveillance | As clinically indicated |

---

CEA is most useful for **postoperative surveillance** and **treatment monitoring** in colorectal cancer, with limited roles in other cancers. Results must be interpreted in clinical context due to nonspecific elevations and false negatives.

Clinical Question

What is the trade-off between sensitivity and specificity at specific carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) thresholds for detecting recurrent colorectal cancer?

Bottom Line

To detect colorectal cancer recurrence, the sensitivity of CEA ranges from 68% for a threshold of 10 µg/L to 82% for a threshold of 2.5 µg/L and the specificity ranges from 97% for a threshold of 10 µg/L to 80% for a threshold of 2.5 µg/L.

### Summary report of the standards, options and recommendations for the use of serum tumour markers in breast cancer: 2000 [^bbbbbde7]. British Journal of Cancer (2003). Low credibility.

OBJECTIVES

The objective was to define the characteristics of breast cancer tumour markers and identify their potential role in the management of patient with cancer. The main question concerns the role of CA 15–3 (and to a lesser degree that of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA)) in the early diagnosis of metastases and locoregional recurrence and in evaluation of response to treatment.

These recommendations are intended for both scientists and clinicians. This document does not cover the clinical indications in which tumour markers should or can be used. This aspect is covered in the Standards, Options and Recommendations (SORs) document on metastatic breast cancer. This document aims to provide the multidisciplinary team, responsible for defining the treatment plan, with laboratory data to help them optimise the management of patients with metastatic breast cancer.

### New insights into the role of age and carcinoembryonic antigen in the prognosis of colorectal cancer [^afff2340]. British Journal of Cancer (2008). Low credibility.

The clinical importance of CEA is clear at whatever time it is assessed along the clinical course of patients with colorectal cancer, but the demonstration of it having a prognostic role also postoperatively would be interesting for deciding treatment strategies. Besides providing a serologic indication of how radical the resection has been, in addition to the mandatory microscopic inspections by the histopathologists – it could offer further information to guide the choice of subsequent treatment. This decisional step is becoming ever more critical given the large number of available adjuvant chemotherapy regimens, with selective indications and different intensities and toxicities. Since the ultimate fate of the patients with colorectal cancer is related to three main factors (initial tumour stage, radicality of the surgical resection and effectiveness of adjuvant therapy – when necessary), the postoperative evaluation of the CEA level (after 5–6 weeks), in that it allows a reliable check of the last two factors, can be at least as important as the preoperative one. Thus, we fully agree with the proposal of the American Joint Committee on Cancer, which recommends the inclusion of CEA into the TNM classification (with the following suggested notations for any stage: CX, CEA not assessed; C0, CEA not elevated; and C1, CEA elevated). We only wonder whether the measurements of CEA for such a categorisation should be more properly performed at a suitable interval after surgery (we suggest 5–6 weeks) – instead of or in addition to before surgery.

In conclusion, our study of the relative survival in a population of patients who had undergone radical resection of colorectal cancer fully confirms the adequacy of the individual clinicopathological factors, which are the basis of the current Dukes', modified Astler–Coller and TNM staging classifications. The results presented offer a possible explanation for the conflicting reports on the prognostic role of age and, finally, show the true prognostic value – strictly related to cancer – of the CEA level, with particular emphasis on its postoperative assessment.

### ASCO 2006 update of recommendations for the use of tumor markers in gastrointestinal cancer [^8b5711ee]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose

To update the recommendations for the use of tumor marker tests in the prevention, screening, treatment, and surveillance of gastrointestinal cancers.

Methods

For the 2006 update, an update committee composed of members from the full Panel was formed to complete the review and analysis of data published since 1999. Computerized literature searches of Medline and the Cochrane Collaboration Library were performed. The Update Committee's literature review focused attention on available systematic reviews and meta-analyses of published tumor marker studies.

Recommendations and Conclusion

For colorectal cancer, it is recommended that carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) be ordered preoperatively, if it would assist in staging and surgical planning. Postoperative CEA levels should be performed every 3 months for stage II and III disease for at least 3 years if the patient is a potential candidate for surgery or chemotherapy of metastatic disease. CEA is the marker of choice for monitoring the response of metastatic disease to systemic therapy. Data are insufficient to recommend the routine use of p53, ras, thymidine synthase, dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase, thymidine phosphorylase, microsatellite instability, 18q loss of heterozygosity, or deleted in colon cancer (DCC) protein in the management of patients with colorectal cancer. For pancreatic cancer, CA 19–9 can be measured every 1 to 3 months for patients with locally advanced or metastatic disease receiving active therapy. Elevations in serial CA 19–9 determinations suggest progressive disease but confirmation with other studies should be sought. New markers and new evidence to support the use of the currently reviewed markers will be evaluated in future updates of these guidelines.

### The American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons clinical practice guidelines for the management of colon cancer [^f9dda7f4]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2022). High credibility.

Preoperative assessment and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) in colon cancer — A carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level should be obtained before elective surgery for colon cancer to establish a baseline value that is prognostic for recurrence and survival and to provide a reference value for use during surveillance; routine labs should include a complete blood count, liver function tests, and a chemistry panel, and physical examination should include assessment for an abdominal mass or surgical scars. A multivariate analysis of more than 130,000 patients indicated that preoperative CEA is an independent predictor of overall survival in patients with stage I to III colon cancer, and patients with an elevated CEA had a 62% increase in the hazard of death compared with patients with a normal preoperative CEA, although the optimal cutoff value is not clear. In stage IV colorectal cancer, a decrease in CEA in response to treatment with chemotherapy has been associated with improved survival.

### The American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons clinical practice guidelines for the management of rectal cancer [^6de73f57]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2020). High credibility.

Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and other tumor markers in preoperative evaluation — key points are that routine laboratory bloodwork and a CEA level are part of the preoperative evaluation. The baseline CEA level before initiating elective treatment is prognostic of long-term survival and is used as a reference during posttherapy surveillance. Although CEA levels assessed at different time points during multimodality treatment can correlate with treatment response, CEA does not reliably predict pathologic response to neoadjuvant therapy. There is insufficient evidence to support the routine use of other tumor markers such as CA19-9 in the evaluation of patients with rectal cancer.

### Reporting of prognostic markers: current problems and development of guidelines for evidence-based practice in the future [^ffd79fa5]. British Journal of Cancer (2003). Low credibility.

Prognostic markers (also called prognostic variables or factors) are relevant tools in the management of patients with cancer, and also many other medical conditions, because they help to stratify patients for treatment by identifying different risk groups in order to reduce morbidity and mortality. They include biological, clinical, genetic, histological and pathological features. For example, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) is a prognostic marker in colorectal cancer.

An evidence-based approach to identifying the most valuable prognostic markers for a given disease is clearly important because it is common for evidence relating to markers to be published across a number of studies, often with conflicting results (, pp 228–247;). Furthermore, a frequent difficulty in assessing the clinical value of prognostic markers is the relatively small number of patients in primary research studies, sometimes a consequence of disease rarity and limited resources, such that each primary study has low statistical power for detecting any benefits of prognostic staging. The use of systematic review, and in particular meta-analysis, methodology may therefore be important and allow a useful assessment of the prognostic power of markers (, pp 228–247). A systematic review is the preferred means of identifying and combining existing evidence. Meta-analysis is the statistical analysis of the review, which seeks to combine all the relevant results found from the literature identified in a quantitative way to produce results more precise than is possible from the individual studies.

In this paper, we use a recently performed systematic review of prognostic tumour markers studied in neuroblastoma to demonstrate the problems encountered when using this approach, and highlight how they limit evidence-based practice. We then generalise the problems to other areas of oncology, and indeed other disease settings, and ultimately provide specific guidelines for reporting primary prognostic marker studies.

### Concordance of carcinoembryonic antigen ratio and response evaluation criteria in solid tumors as prognostic surrogate indicators of metastatic colorectal cancer patients treated with chemotherapy [^a7ae7945]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) is widely used as a tumor marker in colorectal cancer (CRC). This study aimed to evaluate the role of the degree of change in CEA levels during the treatment period and found that the degree of change highly correlated with disease survival and Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria in evaluating therapy response.

Methods

A total of 447 metastatic CRC patients treated with surgery of the primary tumor followed by systemic therapy at a single center from the year 2000 through 2011 were reviewed. The degree of change in CEA levels was expressed as the CEA ratio (post-CEA/pre-CEA) and classified into four groups during the treatment period for further evaluation. The imaging change of the same population was also compared with the CEA ratio during the treatment period.

Results

The CEA ratio was significantly correlated with different chemotherapy regimens (p < 0.001), pre-treatment CEA level (p < 0.001), lymphovascular invasion (p = 0.006), and tumor differentiation (p = 0.018). CEA ratio and imaging change according to RECIST criteria were both correlated with overall survival (p < 0.001). These two methods for evaluating treatment response were highly correlated (p < 0.001).

Conclusions

CEA ratio was found to be a reliable prognostic factor in stage IV CRC, and was highly correlated with the imaging survey according to RECIST criteria. Further prospective studies are essential to validate these findings.

### Colon cancer, version 3.2024, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^22505aa9]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2024). High credibility.

Colon cancer — carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) surveillance after R0 resection: CEA follow-up is described as every 3 months until either disease is identified or CEA level stabilizes or declines. Approximately half of elevations were false positives, mostly 5 to 15 ng/mL; false-positive results > 15 ng/mL were rare, and all results > 35 ng/mL represented true positives. The pooled sensitivity and specificity of CEA at a cutoff of 10 ng/mL were 68% (95% CI, 53–79) and 97% (95% CI, 90–99), respectively. In the first 2 years post-resection, a CEA cutoff of 10 ng/mL is estimated to detect 20 recurrences, miss 10 recurrences, and result in 29 false positives.

### Use of tumor markers in gastrointestinal cancers: surgeon perceptions and cost-benefit trade-off analysis [^7e096a3a]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2017). Low credibility.

Tumor Marker Survey

The survey was distributed online from 1 August to 1 September 2015, and a total of 443 responses were collected, representing a response rate of 8.1%. There were 273 respondents with an interest in colorectal disease (200 consultants, 59 registrars, and 14 who were primarily academic), and who had completed a median of more than 100 cancer operations. CEA was the most commonly utilized tumor marker in colorectal cancer (Fig. 2 a), with surveillance for recurrence the most common indication (Fig. 2 c).

Fig. 2
Survey results detailing the most commonly used tumor markers and the most commonly cited indications in (a, c) colorectal cancer and (b, d) esophagogastric cancer. CEA carcinoembryonic antigen, CA cancer antigen

With respect to upper gastrointestinal surgery, 170 respondents (131 consultants, 29 registrars, and 10 primarily academic) had completed a median of more than 100 cancer operations. CEA was the most commonly employed tumor marker (Fig. 2 b), with assessment for recurrence being the most common indication (Fig. 2 d).

Of the eight performance characteristics, the ideal tumor marker would have, diagnostic sensitivity ranked the overall highest (most desirable), followed by diagnostic specificity. Consistency across demographics was considered the least desirable (Tables 1, 2).

Cost-Benefit Trade-Off

All tumor markers had identical performances with regard to patient acceptability and speed for result. As all were derived from serum, with a result returned within 24 h, these characteristics were removed from the analysis. Tables 1 and 2 display the performance of each tumor marker with respect to the eight characteristics and the associated importance ranking derived from the survey.

Figure 3 displays the trade-offs between the benefits (high diagnostic sensitivity, specificity, consistency, predictive ability for recurrence and metastases) and costs (financial). CEA outperformed both CA19-9 and CA125 with respect to overall utility; it had lower associated financial costs and higher benefits, as weighted by the importance placed on the characteristics. This pattern was seen with both colorectal and esophagogastric cancer.

### Carcinoembryonic antigen is the preferred biomarker for in vivo colorectal cancer targeting [^6faf79bd]. British Journal of Cancer (2013). Low credibility.

A surprising feature of all the above examples of targeted tumour delivery is that the choice of biomarker used is rarely justified in terms of its tumour sensitivity and specificity. The characteristics of suitable cancer biomarkers are that they must be highly expressed in a large majority of tumours and have low or no expression in normal tissue, encompassing the normal tissue from which the tumour is derived and – ideally – most or all normal adult tissues accessible to systemic delivery. Suitable molecules must also be located on the external facing surfaces of cancer cells so as to be accessible to systemically delivered recognition molecules. To our knowledge, expression of the most commonly used markers for colorectal cancer has never been rigorously evaluated in a well-defined cohort of cancer and normal tissue. We aimed to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of the four most commonly used markers for colorectal cancer, CEA, TAG-72, FR α, and EGFR, to define which is most suitable for in vivo tumour targeting.

### Definition of tumor marker-NCI dictionary of cancer terms… [^1a17f4f1]. NCI (2011). Low credibility.

tumor marker A substance found in tissue, blood, bone marrow, or other body fluids that may be a sign of cancer or certain benign conditions. Many tumor markers are proteins made by both normal cells and cancer cells, but they are made in higher amounts by cancer cells. Genetic changes in tumor tissue, such as gene mutations, patterns of gene expression, and other changes in tumor DNA or RNA, are also being used as tumor markers. A tumor marker may be used with other tests to help diagnose cancer. It may also be used to help plan treatment, give a likely prognosis, and find out how well treatment is working or if cancer has come back. Examples of tumor markers include CA-125, estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor, CEA, PCA3 mRNA and PSA, and EGFR gene mutation.

### Effect of 3 to 5 years of scheduled CEA and CT follow-up to detect recurrence of colorectal cancer: the FACS randomized clinical trial [^fa0f27c9]. JAMA (2014). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Intensive follow-up after surgery for colorectal cancer is common practice but is based on limited evidence.

Objective

To assess the effect of scheduled blood measurement of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and computed tomography (CT) as follow-up to detect recurrent colorectal cancer treatable with curative intent.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Randomized clinical trial in 39 National Health Service hospitals in the United Kingdom; 1202 eligible participants were recruited between January 2003 and August 2009 who had undergone curative surgery for primary colorectal cancer, including adjuvant treatment if indicated, with no evidence of residual disease on investigation.

Interventions

Participants were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 groups: CEA only (n = 300), CT only (n = 299), CEA+CT (n = 302), or minimum follow-up (n = 301). Blood CEA was measured every 3 months for 2 years, then every 6 months for 3 years; CT scans of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis were performed every 6 months for 2 years, then annually for 3 years; and the minimum follow-up group received follow-up if symptoms occurred.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was surgical treatment of recurrence with curative intent; secondary outcomes were mortality (total and colorectal cancer), time to detection of recurrence, and survival after treatment of recurrence with curative intent.

Results

After a mean 4.4 (SD, 0.8) years of observation, cancer recurrence was detected in 199 participants (16.6%; 95% CI, 14.5%-18.7%) overall; 71 of 1202 participants (5.9%; 95% CI, 4.6%-7.2%) were treated for recurrence with curative intent, with little difference according to Dukes staging (stage A, 5.1% [13/254]; stage B, 6.1% [34/553]; stage C, 6.2% [22/354]). Surgical treatment of recurrence with curative intent was 2.3% (7/301) in the minimum follow-up group, 6.7% (20/300) in the CEA group, 8% (24/299) in the CT group, and 6.6% (20/302) in the CEA+CT group. Compared with minimum follow-up, the absolute difference in the percentage of patients treated with curative intent in the CEA group was 4.4% (95% CI, 1.0%-7.9%; adjusted odds ratio [OR], 3.00; 95% CI, 1.23–7.33), in the CT group was 5.7% (95% CI, 2.2%-9.5%; adjusted OR, 3.63; 95% CI, 1.51–8.69), and in the CEA+CT group was 4.3% (95% CI, 1.0%-7.9%; adjusted OR, 3.10; 95% CI, 1.10–8.71). The number of deaths was not significantly different in the combined intensive monitoring groups (CEA, CT, and CEA+CT; 18.2% [164/901]) vs the minimum follow-up group (15.9% [48/301]; difference, 2.3%; 95% CI, -2.6% to 7.1%).

Conclusions and Relevance

Among patients who had undergone curative surgery for primary colorectal cancer, intensive imaging or CEA screening each provided an increased rate of surgical treatment of recurrence with curative intent compared with minimal follow-up; there was no advantage in combining CEA and CT. If there is a survival advantage to any strategy, it is likely to be small.

### Comparison of carcinoembryonic antigen prognostic value in serum and tumour tissue of patients with colorectal cancer [^7ca061e1]. Colorectal Disease (2009). Low credibility.

Introduction

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common tumour types in the world, with about 400 000 deaths annually. In the United States, despite a slight decrease in its incidence and mortality during the past two decades, CRC remains the third most common cancer, affecting about 140 000 people and accounting for 50 000 cancer-related deaths per year. In China, where the incidence rate was initially low, due to the changes in lifestyle and nutritional habits, the CRC rate is increasing by 4.2% annually.

Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) is the most commonly used tumour marker for the diagnosis of CRC and evaluation of prognosis or recurrence after treatment. The guideline of National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) indicated that for T2 or greater lesions, a CEA test is recommended at baseline and every 3 months for 2 years. CEA can be detected and quantitatively measured in the serum and the tumour tissue of CRC patients, but their role in the prognosis of CRC remains controversial. The objective of this study was to compare the prognostic value of CEA both in tumour tissue and in serum of the patients with CRC.

### Serum carcinoembryonic antigen trends for diagnosing colorectal cancer recurrence in the FACS randomized clinical trial [^67a1a7c3]. The British Journal of Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Most guidelines recommend that patients who have undergone curative resection for primary colorectal cancer are followed up for 5 years with regular blood carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) tests to trigger further investigation for recurrence. However, CEA may miss recurrences, or patients may have false alarms and undergo unnecessary investigation.

Methods

The diagnostic accuracy of trends in CEA measurements for recurrent colorectal cancer, taken as part of the FACS (Follow-up After Colorectal Surgery) trial (2003–2014), were analysed. Investigation to detect recurrence was triggered by clinical symptoms, scheduled CT or colonoscopy, or a CEA level of at least 7 μg/l above baseline. Time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to compare the diagnostic accuracy of CEA trends with single measurements. CEA trends were estimated using linear regression.

Results

The area under the ROC curve (AUC) for CEA trend was at least 0.820 across all 5 years of follow-up. In comparison, the AUCs for single measurements ranged from 0.623 to 0.749. Improvement was most marked at the end of the first year of follow-up, with the AUC increasing from 0.623 (95 per cent c.i. 0.509 to 0.736) to 0.880 (0.814 to 0.947). However, no individual trend threshold achieved a sensitivity above 70 per cent (30 per cent missed recurrences).

Conclusion

Interpreting trends in CEA measurements instead of single CEA test results improves diagnostic accuracy for recurrence, but not sufficiently to warrant it being used as a single surveillance strategy to trigger further investigation. In the absence of a more accurate biomarker, monitoring trends in CEA should be combined with clinical, endoscopic and imaging surveillance for improved accuracy.

### Transient carcinoembryonic antigen elevations during adjuvant chemotherapy for colorectal cancer reflect the burden of residual micrometastatic disease [^eddbfa4a]. Clinical Colorectal Cancer (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) testing is routinely used to monitor the progress of patients with advanced cancer on treatment, or else to detect relapse during follow-up, particularly in colorectal cancer (CRC). Although CEA levels have been reported to rise during adjuvant drug therapies, the mechanism of such 'surges' is not clear. This study was conducted to clarify the clinical significance of this phenomenon.

Patients and Methods

We conducted a retrospective analysis of CEA levels in 88 consecutive patients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy in our center: 39 patients with primary CRC and a comparison cohort of 49 patients with breast cancer treated with adjuvant chemotherapy. In the event of 2 serial CEA increases, endoscopic and/or imaging investigations were performed to exclude recurrence. Subset analyses were based on nodal status and primary tumor type.

Results

Primary resection was associated with significant CEA decline in patients with CRC but not in those with breast cancer. Forty-three patients (48.9%) experienced CEA fluctuations exceeding 0.5 ng/mL during adjuvant chemotherapy; CEA increases indicated true recurrence in 2 patients (4.7%). Adjuvant CEA surges occurred both more often and more extensively in disease associated with ≥ 4 positive nodes in patients with CRC but not in patients with breast cancer (P < .05).

Conclusion

Both the frequency and extent of CEA surges during adjuvant chemotherapy parallel the severity of preoperative nodal involvement in CRC but not in breast cancer, suggesting that such surges reflect tumorilytic effects on occult disease in patients with CRC only. However, whether these CEA surges predict survival that is inferior (ie, because of greater burden of residual disease) or superior (ie, because of greater tumorilytic efficacy) to that of stagematched 'nonsurge' patients, remains to be determined by larger, prospective CRC studies.

### Comparison of carcinoembryonic antigen prognostic value in serum and tumour tissue of patients with colorectal cancer [^a937658d]. Colorectal Disease (2009). Low credibility.

Discussion

Carcinoembryonic antigen was first described in 1965 by Gold and Freedman, when they identified an antigen that was present in both fetal colon and colon adenocarcinoma but that was absent from the healthy adult colon, hence its name, carcinoembryonic antigen. Subsequent work showed that CEA was also present in certain healthy tissues, although concentrations in tumours were on average 60-fold higher than in the nonmalignant tissues. Now CEA gene is classified as a member of the immunoglobulin supergene family.

Carcinoembryonic antigen is the most widely used tumour marker worldwide and certainly the most frequently used marker in CRC. It could be detected and measured both in serum and in CRC tissue. The prognostic role of increased CEA level in serum and tumour tissue of CRC patients remains unknown.

### Characteristics of carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecules and their relationship to cancer [^90c61e92]. Molecular Cancer Therapeutics (2024). Medium credibility.

Carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecules (CEACAM), such as carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and the oncofetal glycoprotein family, are tumor markers. The CEACAMs consist of 12 different human CEACAMs and 5 different murine CEACAMs. The CEACAM family of proteins participates in multiple biological processes that include the immune response, angiogenesis, and cancer. CEACAMs play a significant role in cancer initiation and development. Increasing evidence suggests that family members may be new cancer biomarkers and targets in that CEACEAMs tend to be aberrantly expressed and therefore may have potential diagnostic and therapeutic importance. This review systematically summarizes the biogenesis, biological properties, and functions of CEACAMs, with a focus on their relationship with cancer and potential clinical application. As our knowledge of the relationships among CEACAMs and cancer increases, and as our understanding of the involved molecular mechanisms improves, new therapeutic strategies will evolve for cancer prevention and treatment of patients with cancer.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: rectal cancer, version 3.2024 [^9caa5191]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2024). High credibility.

Managing an increasing carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level after resection should include colonoscopy; chest, abdominal, and pelvic CT scans; physical examination; and consideration of a PET/CT scan, and if imaging study results are normal in the face of a rising CEA, repeat CT scans are recommended every 3 months until either disease is identified or CEA level stabilizes or declines. In a retrospective chart review, approximately half of elevations in CEA levels after R0 resection of locoregional CRC were false positives, with most being in the range of 5 to 15 ng/mL; false-positive results greater than 15 ng/mL were rare, and all results greater than 35 ng/mL represented true positives. At a cutoff of 10 ng/mL, pooled CEA performance was calculated at 68% (95% CI, 53%–79%) sensitivity and 97% (95% CI, 90%–99%) specificity, with estimates that in the first 2 years post-resection a CEA cutoff of 10 ng/mL would detect 20 recurrences, miss 10 recurrences, and result in 29 false positives. A PET/CT scan may be considered in the scenario of an elevated CEA with negative, good-quality CT scans; a meta-analysis of 11 studies (510 patients) reported pooled sensitivity and specificity for the detection of tumor recurrence of 94.1% (95% CI, 89.4%–97.1%) and 77.2% (95% CI, 66.4%–85.9%), respectively, and an analysis of 88 patients under surveillance found PET/CT had a sensitivity of 88% and a specificity of 88% for the detection of recurrences. The panel does not recommend a so-called blind or CEA-directed laparotomy or laparoscopy for patients whose workup for an increased CEA level is negative.

### Prognostic value of the postoperative carcinoembryonic antigen level in colorectal cancer: a meta-analysis [^1cbbfb5e]. World Journal of Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) is one of the commonly used preoperative biomarkers for colorectal cancer (CRC), but no meta-analysis has evaluated the findings of all recently published studies to determine whether its postoperative level can serve as a prognostic indicator.

Methods

We conducted a systematic search for eligible literature from the PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science databases in October 2023. Studies that investigated the relationship between postoperative serum CEA levels and prognosis in CRC patients were included. Outcome indicators, including overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), and progression-free survival (PFS)/recurrence-free survival (RFS), were analyzed using a fixed-effects or random-effects model. The pooled hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were used as effective values.

Results

This meta-analysis included 20 eligible studies involving 10,114 CRC patients from the East Asian and Western countries. A comprehensive analysis revealed that elevated postoperative CEA levels were associated with low OS (HR: 2.92, 95% CI: 2.36–3.62, and p < 0.000), DFS (HR: 2.81, 95% CI: 2.01–3.94, and p < 0.000), and RFS/PFS (HR: 2.52, 95% CI: 1.75–3.62, p < 0.000). A subgroup analysis by region, analysis type, distant metastasis, HR obtain method, sample size, postoperative measurement date, and study design demonstrated that the negative correlation observed between high serum CEA levels after surgery and poor prognosis was not significantly different between the subgroups.

Conclusion

When CEA levels are found to be elevated during postoperative follow-up, more active intervention measures should be implemented to further improve the patient's survival outcomes.

### Carcinoembryonic antigen is the preferred biomarker for in vivo colorectal cancer targeting [^1915eb6f]. British Journal of Cancer (2013). Low credibility.

In practical imaging situations, the threshold, or cutoff, used to differentiate between normal and tumour would be determined by the user, by adjusting the signal gain. This could be altered to favour either sensitivity (lowering the cutoff to detect tumours more easily at the risk of detecting normal tissue erroneously) or specificity (raising the cutoff to avoid detection of normal tissue at the risk of missing tumour cells). We quantified the abilities of the markers to be used in tumour cell detection using their optimal cutoffs, as determined using ROC analyses, in terms of sensitivity (proportion of tumours correctly detected) and specificity (proportion of normal tissues correctly not detected). Carcinoembryonic antigen was the most sensitive marker by a considerable margin (93.7%, as compared with the nearest alternative TAG-72 at 70.3%), and was also highly specific (96.1%). Folate receptor- α was the most specific marker (99.2%); however, its utility is limited by the fact that it was not detectable in the majority of tumours, as previously reported, resulting in a poor sensitivity (39.3%). In addition, the magnitude of differential expression between normal and tumour was relatively narrow, providing less security in determining tumour or normal identities. Most notably, EGFR was a surprisingly poor marker, being detected in less than half the tumours and being commonly more highly expressed in normal tissues than in tumours. For applications aiming at targeted delivery of therapeutics, similar considerations apply. Markers must allow a balance between ensuring tumour cells receive the cytotoxic insult while minimising collateral damage in normal cells that may express the antigen. In this context, FR α may be an appropriate target in the tumours that express it, with very high specificity allowing minimal damage to normal cells. However, CEA is more suitable in a much larger proportion of tumours, accepting that normal tissues may suffer some dose of drug, albeit a much lower dose than the tumour cells.

We therefore conclude that of the four biomarkers tested, CEA alone is the most suitable for tumour targeting, and this should be reflected in future strategies for in vivo tumour diagnosis and therapeutic delivery.

### Carcinoembryonic antigen as an independent prognostic factor of recurrence and survival in patients resected for colorectal liver metastases: a systematic review [^4fa59ffa]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2001). Low credibility.

Purpose

We attempted to answer the question of whether serum levels of carcinoembryonic antigen provide prognostic information, in terms of survival, in patients resected for colorectal liver metastases, independently of that provided by other commonly used radioclinical and pathologic factors.

Method

We performed a systematic review, without meta-analysis, of the biomedical literature using the methodology recommended by the Committee on Evidence-Based Laboratory Medicine of the International Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine.

Results

Despite the absence of sufficient details about the methods used to measure serum carcinoembryonic antigen in the 14 studies reviewed, strong arguments exist to include preoperative carcinoembryonic antigen measurements in future trials on the subject. In particular, preoperative carcinoembryonic antigen was found to be significant in the two studies with the greatest number of patients having a preoperative carcinoembryonic antigen assay, in the four studies with the most recent series of patients, in the study in which preoperative carcinoembryonic antigen was used as a continuous variable, and in the study in which preoperative carcinoembryonic antigen was used in terms of doubling time. Postoperative carcinoembryonic antigen was found to have a prognostic significance in the only two studies that evaluated this variable.

Conclusion

Taking into account the possible reasons for disagreements regarding carcinoembryonic antigen prognostic value between the 14 studies reviewed, we propose some recommendations to improve the reproducibility and the quality of future studies in this field. In particular, we stress the need for a higher degree of multidisciplinary collaboration in clinical trials.

### Blood CEA levels for detecting recurrent colorectal cancer [^d96a0d0b]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Testing for carcino-embryonic antigen (CEA) in the blood is a recommended part of follow-up to detect recurrence of colorectal cancer following primary curative treatment. There is substantial clinical variation in the cut-off level applied to trigger further investigation.

Objectives

To determine the diagnostic performance of different blood CEA levels in identifying people with colorectal cancer recurrence in order to inform clinical practice.

Search Methods

We conducted all searches to January 29 2014. We applied no language limits to the searches, and translated non-English manuscripts. We searched for relevant reviews in the MEDLINE, EMBASE, MEDION and DARE databases. We searched for primary studies (including conference abstracts) in the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), in MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Science Citation Index & Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science. We identified ongoing studies by searching WHO ICTRP and the ASCO meeting library.

Selection Criteria

We included cross-sectional diagnostic test accuracy studies, cohort studies, and randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of post-resection colorectal cancer follow-up that compared CEA to a reference standard. We included studies only if we could extract 2 x 2 accuracy data. We excluded case-control studies, as the ratio of cases to controls is determined by the study design, making the data unsuitable for assessing test accuracy.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors (BDN, IP) assessed the quality of all articles independently, discussing any disagreements. Where we could not reach consensus, a third author (BS) acted as moderator. We assessed methodological quality against QUADAS-2 criteria. We extracted binary diagnostic accuracy data from all included studies as 2 x 2 tables. We conducted a bivariate meta-analysis. We used the xtmelogit command in Stata to produce the pooled estimates of sensitivity and specificity and we also produced hierarchical summary ROC plots.

Main Results

In the 52 included studies, sensitivity ranged from 41% to 97% and specificity from 52% to 100%. In the seven studies reporting the impact of applying a threshold of 2.5 µg/L, pooled sensitivity was 82% (95% confidence interval (CI) 78% to 86%) and pooled specificity 80% (95% CI 59% to 92%). In the 23 studies reporting the impact of applying a threshold of 5 µg/L, pooled sensitivity was 71% (95% CI 64% to 76%) and pooled specificity 88% (95% CI 84% to 92%). In the seven studies reporting the impact of applying a threshold of 10 µg/L, pooled sensitivity was 68% (95% CI 53% to 79%) and pooled specificity 97% (95% CI 90% to 99%).

Authors' Conclusions

CEA is insufficiently sensitive to be used alone, even with a low threshold. It is therefore essential to augment CEA monitoring with another diagnostic modality in order to avoid missed cases. Trying to improve sensitivity by adopting a low threshold is a poor strategy because of the high numbers of false alarms generated. We therefore recommend monitoring for colorectal cancer recurrence with more than one diagnostic modality but applying the highest CEA cut-off assessed (10 µg/L).

### Carbohydrate antigen 19–9 plus carcinoembryonic antigen for prognosis in colorectal cancer: an observational study [^d06b108f]. Colorectal Disease (2023). Medium credibility.

Aim

Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) is a primary prognostic marker and can detect colorectal cancer (CRC) recurrence; however, it has low sensitivity. Carbohydrate antigen 19–9 (CA 19–9) can be used as a supplemental tumour marker along with CEA. The purpose of this study was to determine whether preoperative CA 19–9 added to CEA helped predict long-term prognosis and whether follow-up CA 19–9 added to CEA had additional benefits in diagnosing the recurrence of CRC.

Method

We retrospectively assessed patients who underwent surgery for primary CRC between January 2004 and December 2015 at Seoul National University Hospital. Data on demographics, preoperative and follow-up CEA and CA 19–9 levels, recurrence and survival were obtained and analysed with respect to tumour marker levels to ascertain their prognostic and diagnostic values.

Results

A total of 4972 and 1530 patients were included to analyse preoperative and follow-up tumour marker levels, respectively. The 5-year relapse-free survival rates were 72.2% ± 0.8%, 52.5% ± 2.2%, 55.5% ± 3.2% and 32.1% ± 2.3% in the normal CEA and CA 19–9, high CEA, high CA 19–9, and high CEA and high CA 19–9 groups, respectively (all P < 0.001). Patients whose elevated CEA or CA 19–9 levels reduced to normal levels had better survival outcomes than those with postoperatively elevated levels. Elevated follow-up CA 19–9 and CEA levels were related to higher incidences of distant metastasis (CA 19–9, 14.0% vs. 23.1%, P = 0.004; CEA, 12.6% vs. 30.1%, P < 0.001) but not to local recurrence. Combined follow-up CEA and CA 19–9 increased the sensitivity for recurrence to 31.4%, with a 5% difference from the sensitivity of CEA alone. In the subgroup with high preoperative CA 19–9 levels, sensitivity increased by 18.2% overall.

Conclusion

CA 19–9 is a valuable prognostic and diagnostic marker for CRC when used adjunctively with CEA and can be a supplementary marker with CEA to improve sensitivity, especially with elevated preoperative CA 19–9.

### Community compliance with carcinoembryonic antigen: follow-up of patients with colorectal cancer [^d06cd83c]. Clinical Colorectal Cancer (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose

The aim of this study was to determine whether recommendations for surveillance carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) testing in stage II/III colorectal cancer (CRC) are adhered to upon discharge from our cancer center, patterns of care after CEA elevation, and whether differences in outcomes exist between patients who did and did not receive recommended CEA monitoring.

Patients and Methods

A retrospective, single-institution chart review was completed at the Cross Cancer Institute (CCI) in Edmonton, Alberta. The Alberta Cancer Registry (ACR) identified patients with CRC diagnosed between January 1 and December 31, 2001. Patients with stage II/III CRC seen and/or treated at the CCI and later discharged to the community with follow-up recommendations based on American Society of Clinical Oncology guidelines were included. Carcinoembryonic antigen monitoring ≥ every 4 months for ≥ 2 years was deemed acceptable for study purposes.

Results

The ACR identified 152 stage II/III CRC cases meeting inclusion criteria. Eleven patients (7.2%) received the minimum predefined CEA follow-up. Eighty-seven CEA follow-up tests were elevated; only 20 (23%) elevated CEAs were investigated with predefined timely intervention. Twenty-six patients (17.1%) had documentable tumor recurrence. There was no difference in overall survival or time to recurrence between the groups who received and did not receive appropriate follow-up, although small numbers limit the effectiveness of statistical analysis.

Conclusion

Post-therapy surveillance is important in CRC management. Our study reveals follow-up recommendations based on best available evidence for interval CEA testing are not followed in the community. These findings suggest the need for review of recommendations and change in management for monitoring discharged patients with stage II/III CRC.

### Assessing the prognostic value of preoperative carcinoembryonic antigen-specific T-cell responses in colorectal cancer [^7c97b86f]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2015). Low credibility.

CEA-specific T-cell responsiveness could also reflect more advanced tumor stages, ie, presence of micrometastases that are not demonstrated by conventional staging techniques. Whilst further studies are required to uncover why CEA-specific T-cells confer harm, it is clear that measuring these responses could offer crucial prognostic information independent of tumor stage and help identify patients at risk for tumor recurrence. Although this particular study was limited by the relatively small sample size without a validation cohort and by the fact that immunological data were not available for all patients, the conclusions from this study raise the possibility that targeting adjuvant treatments at CEA + T-cell responders may improve treatment outcome.

### Evaluation of comparative surveillance strategies of circulating tumor DNA, imaging, and carcinoembryonic antigen levels in patients with resected colorectal cancer [^82361d2c]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Is serial analysis of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) associated with improved sensitivity and earlier detection of recurrence compared with standard imaging and evaluation of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels per National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines in patients with resected colorectal cancer?

Findings

In this cohort study of 48 patients with resected colorectal cancer, 15 had confirmed disease recurrence by imaging, of whom only 8 had a concurrent positive ctDNA finding. The combination of imaging and CEA measurement had better sensitivity compared with ctDNA in identifying disease recurrence (73.3% vs 53.3%).

Meaning

The findings of this cohort study suggest that ctDNA assay provides no definitive advantage compared with standard imaging and CEA measurement in the surveillance of patients with resected colorectal cancer.

### Elevated preoperative CEA is associated with subclinical nodal involvement and worse survival in stage I non-small cell lung cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^622833d2]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Methods

A comprehensive search was performed for articles published on non-small cell lung cancer and tumor markers using the Medline, EMBASE, Scopus data bases. Search terms included "non-small cell lung cancer" or NSCLC or lung adenocarcinoma, AND carcinoembryonic antigen or squamous cell carcinoma antigen or cytokeratin fragment antigen, AND stage I or stage IA or early stage". Literature was limited to human studies in the English language. Abstracts and titles were screened for inclusion by two reviewers (AN and JL). Non-relevant articles based on their abstract were not included for full-text evaluation. Abstracts were then further screened based on the following inclusion criteria: 1) adult patient ≥ 18 years old, 2) primary non-small cell lung cancer (stage I or stage IA or early stage), 3) Tumor markers (Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), cytokeratin fragment antigen (CYFRA 21–1) and squamous cell carcinoma antigen (SCC)), 4) any further imaging such as positron emission tomography (PET) scan or procedure such as mediastinoscopy or endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) or further treatment, 5) studies including > 5 patients, 6) articles in English language. Exclusion criteria included non-English studies, abstracts only, and duplicates.

The primary outcome of interest was utility of tumour markers for predicting pathological tumor invasiveness in patients with clinical stage I NSCLC. Secondary outcomes included subtype of lung cancer, follow-up duration, procedure performed, smoking status, and region of publication. Meta-analysis was performed to determine the following: death within 5 years, and lymph node involvement. This study was conducted and the results are presented according to PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines.

In addition, two independent reviewers assessed the risk of bias using the Newcastle–Ottawa Scale (NOS) for evaluating the quality of the included studies. We rated the quality of the studies (good, fair and poor) according to the guidelines of the NOS. A "good" quality score required 3 or 4 points in selection, 1 or 2 points in comparability, and 2 or 3 points in outcomes. A "fair" quality score required 2 points in selection, 1 or 2 points in comparability, and 2 or 3 points in outcomes. A "poor" quality score reflected 0 or 1 point in selection, or 0 points in comparability, or 0 or 1 point in outcomes (Table 1).

### Evaluation of comparative surveillance strategies of circulating tumor DNA, imaging, and carcinoembryonic antigen levels in patients with resected colorectal cancer [^2df51410]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Surveillance strategies in the management of resected locoregional and metastatic colorectal cancer have been investigated thoroughly during the last several decades. Although carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels and intensive imaging have been investigated as sole or combination strategies in the surveillance of resected stage I to III disease, considerable disagreement remains regarding the impact of these assays on colorectal cancer outcome. Despite the limited benefits of measuring CEA levels and imaging on the overall survival among patients with colorectal cancer, these tests are still believed to have value in the early detection of metastatic disease recurrence, which can lead to curative surgery. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) currently recommends the surveillance of stage II and III colorectal cancer with measurement of CEA levels every 3 to 6 months for 2 years followed by every 6 months for 3 years. In addition, patients with stage II to III colorectal cancer are to undergo computed tomography (CT) of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis every 6 to 12 months for 2 years followed by yearly imaging for 3 years. For resected stage IV disease, the NCCN recommends a similar CEA surveillance strategy and intensive imaging, with a CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis every 3 to 6 months for 2 years followed by every 6 to 12 months for another 3 years. The European Society of Medical Oncology (ESMO) has largely endorsed a similar surveillance strategy. Neither the NCCN nor the ESMO recommend the use of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) assays for surveillance of colorectal cancer.

### Elevated carcinoembryonic antigen and sarcoidosis masquerading as metastatic colon cancer [^5e865a6e]. Clinical Colorectal Cancer (2009). Low credibility.

When patients with colorectal cancer are monitored after resection of primary or metastatic disease, an elevated carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level is usually an indicator of recurrent disease. Positron emission tomography (PET) scans are often used to locate the site of recurrences when computed tomography scans do not show the presence of disease. This case highlights an important cause of a falsely elevated CEA with abnormal PET imaging.

### Carcinoembryonic antigen is the preferred biomarker for in vivo colorectal cancer targeting [^abc94a32]. British Journal of Cancer (2013). Low credibility.

Background:

Colorectal cancer-specific biomarkers have been used as molecular targets for fluorescent intra-operative imaging, targeted PET/MRI, and selective cytotoxic drug delivery yet the selection of biomarkers used is rarely evidence-based. We evaluated sensitivities and specificites of four of the most commonly used markers: carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), tumour-associated glycoprotein-72 (TAG-72), folate receptor- α (FR α) and Epithelial growth factor receptor (EGFR).

Methods:

Marker expression was evaluated semi-quantitatively in matched mucosal and colorectal cancer tissues from 280 patients using immunohistochemistry (scores of 0–15). Matched positive and negative lymph nodes from 18 patients were also examined.

Results:

Markers were more highly expressed in tumour tissue than in matched normal tissue in 98.8%, 79.0%, 37.1% and 32.8% of cases for CEA, TAG-72, FR α and EGFR, respectively. Carcinoembryonic antigen showed the greatest differential expression, with tumours scoring a mean of 10.8 points higher than normal tissues (95% CI 10.31–11.21, P < 0.001). Similarly, CEA showed the greatest differential expression between positive and negative lymph nodes. Receiver operating characteristic analyses showed CEA to have the best sensitivity (93.7%) and specificity (96.1%) for colorectal cancer detection.

Conclusion:

Carcinoembryonic antigen has the greatest potential to allow highly specific tumour imaging and drug delivery; future translational research should aim to exploit this.

### Characterizing surveillance recommendations from National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines [^c058a83a]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Results

Forty-three guidelines provided 483 recommendations across 99 cancer types (Table 1). Four hundred fifty recommendations (93%) of recommendations were assigned category 2A evidence (ie, lower-level evidence with uniform consensus). Although 327 recommendations (68%) were stratified by stage, treatment, or a combination of factors, only 116 (24%) called for individualizing surveillance testing to patient-specific factors (eg, measuring a tumor marker only when initially elevated).

Table 1.
Frequency and Duration Characteristics of Surveillance Recommendations With Select Examples

Abbreviations: CBC, complete blood count; CEA, carcinoembryonic antigen; CT, computed tomography; MRI, magnetic resonance imaging; PSA, prostate specific antigen.

Two hundred twenty-two recommendations (46%) were for imaging, mostly using cross-sectional modalities. Laboratory tests were advised in 109 recommendations (23%), with near-equal distribution across routine (eg, chemistry panel), specialty (eg, hormone panel), and tumor marker laboratory tests. A history and physical or focused clinical examination was recommended in 106 cases (22%), followed by endoscopy in 31 (6%), and pathology testing in 15 cases (3%).

Most recommendations (337 of 483 [70%]) provided guidance on evaluation frequency. Of these, 215 (64%) suggested frequency as a range, and 216 (64%) advised lengthening the interval over time. Regarding duration, 234 (48%) defined an end point and 15 (3%) recommended surveillance testing indefinitely or until cancer progression. An equal number (234 of 483 [48%]) deferred surveillance duration to clinical judgment (ie, "as clinically indicated") or did not specify further.

### The impact of carcinoembryonic antigen flare in patients with advanced colorectal cancer receiving first-line chemotherapy [^855ec322]. Annals of Oncology (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) flare may have a favourable response to chemotherapy, but its impact on survival is unknown. This study aimed to evaluate the incidence of CEA flare and its impact on objective response rate (ORR), progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).

Patients and Methods

Patients with histologically proven advanced colorectal cancer undergoing first-line chemotherapy with three or more serial CEA measurements (one at baseline and two or more during treatment) were included. Patients were grouped according to CEA kinetic as flare (F), decreasing CEA, normal baseline CEA, stable CEA and increasing CEA (I).

Results

From January 2000 to February 2008, 837 patients were screened of whom 670 were eligible. CEA flare occurred in 78 (11.6%) patients. On multivariate analysis, compared with patients with increasing CEA, patients with CEA flare had a significantly better ORR [I versus F: 11% versus 73%; risk ratio (RR): 27.96; 95% confidence interval (CI): 9.55–81.88; P < 0.001], PFS (median 3.1 versus 8.3 months; RR: 0.38; 95% CI: 0.26–0.56; P < 0.001) and OS (median 10.9 versus 17.7 months; RR: 0.53; 95% CI: 0.34–0.82; P < 0.001).

Conclusions

Compared with patients with rising CEA, flare was an independent favourable predictive and prognostic factor for tumour response and survival.

### Carcinoembryonic antigen is the preferred biomarker for in vivo colorectal cancer targeting [^0651b773]. British Journal of Cancer (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Colorectal cancer-specific biomarkers have been used as molecular targets for fluorescent intra-operative imaging, targeted PET/MRI, and selective cytotoxic drug delivery yet the selection of biomarkers used is rarely evidence-based. We evaluated sensitivities and specificites of four of the most commonly used markers: carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), tumour-associated glycoprotein-72 (TAG-72), folate receptor-α (FRα) and Epithelial growth factor receptor (EGFR).

Methods

Marker expression was evaluated semi-quantitatively in matched mucosal and colorectal cancer tissues from 280 patients using immunohistochemistry (scores of 0–15). Matched positive and negative lymph nodes from 18 patients were also examined.

Results

Markers were more highly expressed in tumour tissue than in matched normal tissue in 98.8%, 79.0%, 37.1% and 32.8% of cases for CEA, TAG-72, FRα and EGFR, respectively. Carcinoembryonic antigen showed the greatest differential expression, with tumours scoring a mean of 10.8 points higher than normal tissues (95% CI 10.31–11.21, P < 0.001). Similarly, CEA showed the greatest differential expression between positive and negative lymph nodes. Receiver operating characteristic analyses showed CEA to have the best sensitivity (93.7%) and specificity (96.1%) for colorectal cancer detection.

Conclusion

Carcinoembryonic antigen has the greatest potential to allow highly specific tumour imaging and drug delivery; future translational research should aim to exploit this.

### Assessing the prognostic value of preoperative carcinoembryonic antigen-specific T-cell responses in colorectal cancer [^97db45f4]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2015). Low credibility.

Figure 2.
CEA-specific T-cell responses and tumor recurrence. Irrespective of the tumor stage, patients producing an anti-CEA IFN-γ + T-cell response were more likely to suffer a tumor recurrence, as demonstrated in the Kaplan-Meier curve (A) and the Forest plot (B). The statistically significant difference is indicated (P < .01). All statistical tests were two-sided. For the numbers of patients at risk for each group in the curves please see(available online). CEA = carcinoembryonic antigen; CI = confidence interval; OR = odds ratio; TNM = Tumor-Node-Metastasis.

Currently there is much interest in targeting CEA via anticancer vaccination or T-cell–directed adoptive transfer, thus our findings open up debate about the potential risks of such strategies in certain situations. Why should CEA-specific, but not 5T4-specific, responses be detrimental? There are data demonstrating that adoptive transfer of CEA-specific T-cells to control CRC induces enteropathy in normal colonic tissue. It is possible that a loss of mucosal integrity with increased epithelial leakiness facilitates tumor growth or recurrence.

Additionally, upon examination of primary tumor samples from the cohort described herein, intratumoral T-cells were dominated by the expression of the transcription factor RORγT +, a marker for T H 17 cells; however, this preponderance of RORγT + T-cells within tumors was found in both CEA responders and nonresponders (, available online). The dominance of T H 17 type cells in all patient groups is unexpected. We have optimized peripheral blood assays for measuring IL-17 responses, but as part of an ongoing study in a new group of CRC patients, peripheral blood–derived CEA-specific IL-17–producing T-cells are observed in less than 5% of patients (data not shown). The relationship between blood-derived and tumor-derived antigen-specific T-cell responses awaits further investigation.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: ovarian cancer / fallopian tube cancer / primary peritoneal cancer, version 3.2024 [^d1c63b77]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2024). High credibility.

NCCN Ovarian cancer — tumor markers (CEA, CA-125:CEA ratio, CA19-9): Elevated serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) is associated with gastrointestinal (GI) primaries but can occur in ovarian malignancies, particularly mucinous tumors, and some advocate further GI imaging when serum CEA is high. A ratio of serum CA-125 to CEA > 25 has been proposed to differentiate ovarian cancer from colorectal cancer and this CA-125:CEA ratio has been incorporated into entry criteria in trials testing neoadjuvant therapies. For mucinous ovarian cancer, CEA may be useful for monitoring for recurrent disease. CA19-9 is elevated more often in mucinous tumors, and some studies suggest serum CA19-9 may be useful for monitoring for recurrence, especially in mucinous ovarian cancers and in those with high CA19-9 levels prior to treatment.

### A general cutoff level combined with personalized dynamic change of serum carcinoembryonic antigen can suggest timely use of FDG PET for early detection of recurrent colorectal cancer [^02a35835]. Clinical Nuclear Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose

FDG PET that has been used is good for diagnosing asymptomatic colorectal cancer (CRC) recurrence in patients with elevated serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level. However, there is no reference level of CEA rise that would universally suggest the necessity of a PET study. The purpose of this retrospective study was to identify the high-risk group of CRC recurrence through an examination of the dynamics of the CEA level rise as a recurrence indicator.

Patients and Methods

Between July 2002 and May 2010, 112 patients (59 men, 53 women; age, 18–87 years) had FDG PET for suspicious CRC recurrence indicated by elevated CEA level. We reviewed the PET results and the medical records for recurrence verification and calculated the ratio of increase and the velocity of change in CEA levels for risk stratification.

Results

The patient-based sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of PET are 96.6%, 91.3%, and 95.5%, respectively. The probability of recurrence positively correlated with the CEA level rise and the newly diagnosed disease stage. Carcinoembryonic antigen level greater than 13 ng/mL indicated significantly higher risks of recurrence. In patients with CEA level rise of 13 ng/mL or less, an increase over 3.34 times the individualized baseline also indicated high risks of recurrence.

Conclusions

A posttreatment CEA level rise to greater than 13 ng/mL is suggestive of the optimal use of FDG PET, and so is a mild increase below 13 ng/mL at an increase rate over 3.34.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: ovarian cancer / fallopian tube cancer / primary peritoneal cancer, version 3.2024 [^f66cd679]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2024). High credibility.

NCCN Ovarian cancer — serum tumor markers in preoperative workup and monitoring: CA-125 testing is included as a possible element of preoperative workup when clinically indicated, supported by its correlation with extent of disease, potential prognostic value, and usefulness for monitoring response and surveillance. For HE4, evidence suggests prognostic value and potential earlier detection of recurrence, and panel members sometimes test it for future monitoring in patients without elevated CA-125; however, the guidelines currently do not recommend routine HE4 as part of preoperative workup. In addition to CA-125, other markers may be used preoperatively if clinically indicated — namely inhibin, alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), beta–human chorionic gonadotropin (beta-hCG), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), and CA19-9 — to help assess for less common ovarian cancers and facilitate future surveillance, especially when CA-125 is not elevated or is less informative.

### False-positive elevations of carcinoembryonic antigen in patients with a history of resected colorectal cancer [^6142e240]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2014). Low credibility.

Routine monitoring of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels is standard in patients with resected colorectal cancer (CRC). The incidence of false-positives and the upper limits of false-positive elevations have not been previously well characterized. A search of medical records at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center identified 728 patients who underwent an R0 resection of locoregional CRC between January 2003 and December 2012 and who had an increase in CEA level above the normal range after a normal perioperative CEA level. Of these, 358 had a false-positive elevation of CEA level, 335 had a true-positive elevation indicative of recurrent CRC, and 35 had a true-positive elevation indicative of the development of a new, non-CRC malignancy. Of those with false elevations, 111 had a single isolated CEA level elevation (median highest CEA level of 5.5 ng/mL) with no further abnormal measurements, whereas 247 had elevations on 2 or more readings, with a median highest level of 6.7 ng/mL. Of these 247 patients with confirmed false-positive CEA level elevations, only 5 (2%) had measurements greater than 15 ng/mL, and no confirmed elevation greater than 35 ng/mL was a false-positive. False-positive CEA test results in the range of 5 to 15 ng/mL are common. Confirmation of CEA elevation in this range before initiating imaging studies may be appropriate. False-positive results greater than 15 ng/mL are rare, and all confirmed CEA levels greater than 35 ng/mL were associated with cancer recurrence.

### Carcinoembryonic antigen directed PET-CECT scanning for postoperative surveillance of colorectal cancer [^a90bd275]. Colorectal Disease (2017). Low credibility.

Aim

During the follow-up of surgically resected colorectal cancer (CRC), positron emission tomography-contrast-enhanced computed tomography (PET-CECT) is indicated for asymptomatic elevation of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) > 5 ng/ml and no obvious site of recurrence on clinical examination and basic imaging. As an institutional policy, a PET-CECT scan was performed at our institute whenever (1) CEA levels rose above 5 ng/ml and (2) CEA values were doubled (even if the CEA level was < 5 ng/ml). Our aim was to correlate the range of CEA elevation with recurrence rates and to evaluate the diagnostic utility of PET-CECT scanning in this setting.

Method

We retrospectively analysed all cases where a PET-CECT scan was performed for elevated CEA levels during surveillance visits after complete resection of the primary tumour followed by adjuvant therapy. This study was conducted from 1 January 2013 to 31 July 2015.

Results

In all, 104 patients underwent a PET-CECT scan for rising CEA values, and 62 patients (59.6%) were found to have recurrent disease. At CEA levels < 5, 5.1–10, 10.1–15, 15.1–50 and > 50 ng/ml, disease recurred in 10%, 45%, 70%, 94% and 100% patients, respectively. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of the PET-CECT scan were 92.7%, 95.2%, 96.2% and 90.9%, respectively. Elevation of CEA levels during follow-up was indicative of recurrence in 68% of the secretors and 45% of the non-secretors (based on baseline CEA status).

Conclusion

In the setting of rising CEA levels during follow-up of patients with CRC, a PET-CECT scan is a valuable tool to detect recurrence, irrespective of the baseline CEA secretor status. The likelihood of recurrence of disease was directly proportional to the value of the raised CEA level.

### Negative serum carcinoembryonic antigen has insufficient accuracy for excluding recurrence from patients with dukes C colorectal cancer: analysis with likelihood ratio and posttest probability in a follow-up study [^bdcf2796]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose

This study was designed to determine the efficacy of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) monitoring for screening patients with colorectal cancer by using posttest probability of recurrence.

Methods

For this study, 348 (preoperative serum CEA level elevated: CEA+, n = 119; or normal: CEA-, n = 229) patients who had undergone potentially curative surgery for colorectal cancer were enrolled. After five-year follow-up with measurements of serum CEA levels and imaging workup, posttest probabilities of recurrence were calculated.

Results

Recurrence was observed in 39 percent of CEA+ patients and 30 percent in CEA- patients, and CEA levels were elevated in 33.3 percent of CEA+ patients and 17.5 percent of CEA- patients. With obtained sensitivity (68.4 percent, CEA+; 41 percent, CEA-), specificity (83 percent, CEA+; 91 percent, CEA-) and likelihood ratio (test positive: 4.0, CEA+; 4.4, CEA-; and test negative: 0.38, CEA+; 0.66, CEA-), posttest probability given the presence of CEA elevation in the CEA+ and CEA- was 72.2 and 65.5 percent, respectively, and that given the absence of CEA elevation was 20 and 22.2 percent, respectively.

Conclusions

Whereas postoperative CEA elevation indicates recurrence with high probability, a normal postoperative CEA is not useful for excluding the probability of recurrence.

### Circulating biomarkers for therapeutic monitoring of anti-cancer agents [^802f5412]. The Oncologist (2022). Medium credibility.

Tumor Markers

Extensive efforts have been invested into identifying tumor markers with greater specificity in evaluating tumor burden and response to therapy. Biomarkers with variable clinical utility have been proposed, including those that attempt to recapitulate the tumor burden of cancers with certain histopathological origins.

Cancer Antigen 125

Bast et al first suggested CA 125 (MUC16) as a diagnostic marker of epithelial ovarian cancer in 1983. At present, CA 125 maintains a role in monitoring disease response and is recommended alongside imaging criteria for response assessment in relapsed ovarian cancer by the Gynecological Cancer Intergroup. Despite this, the use of CA 125 elevation as a threshold for initiating treatment before radiological disease recurrence has not been linked to an improvement in OS. Moreover, the sensitivity of CA 125 declines in heavily treated ovarian cancer that is resistant to platinum chemotherapy, reflecting a potential concerning dynamic change in test performance as cancer biology evolves.

Prostate-Specific Antigen

Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is a serine protease which is exclusively produced by prostatic epithelium and escapes into circulation in the setting of malignancy. Blood PSA levels are highly specific for disease recurrence and are also directly linked with survival outcomes in advanced disease. Serum PSA is routinely used to assess disease response in patients with advanced prostate cancer treated with either chemotherapy or androgen receptor axis-targeted treatment. Indeed, PSA is included in standard response assessment criteria in castrate-resistant prostate cancer put forth by the Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Working Group 3. A notable exception to this would be prostate tumors with neuroendocrine features without significant PSA production.

Carcinoembryonic Antigen

Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) is an adhesion molecule involved in signal transduction within adenocarcinomas. Increased serum CEA levels have been described in breast, colorectal, gastric, lung, pancreatic, and ovarian malignancies but can also be observed in benign conditions including inflammatory bowel disease, cigarette smoking, diverticulitis, pancreatitis, liver disease, and alcohol consumption. Although CEA has a weak role as a screening tool for colorectal cancer (CRC), it has been validated as a prognostic biomarker and surrogate of disease burden pre-operatively for patients undergoing CRC resection, as well as a predictor of disease recurrence during follow-up. Stable CEA levels are associated with significantly improved PFS in patients with unresectable metastatic CRC.

### Meta-analysis of colorectal cancer follow-up after potentially curative resection [^b53769b9]. The British Journal of Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Background

After potentially curative resection of primary colorectal cancer, patients may be monitored by measurement of carcinoembryonic antigen and/or CT to detect asymptomatic metastatic disease earlier.

Methods

A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to find evidence for the clinical effectiveness of monitoring in advancing the diagnosis of recurrence and its effect on survival. MEDLINE (Ovid), Embase, the Cochrane Library, Web of Science and other databases were searched for randomized comparisons of increased intensity monitoring compared with a contemporary standard policy after resection of primary colorectal cancer.

Results

There were 16 randomized comparisons, 11 with published survival data. More intensive monitoring advanced the diagnosis of recurrence by a median of 10 (i.q.r. 5–24) months. In ten of 11 studies the authors reported no demonstrable difference in overall survival. Seven RCTs, published from 1995 to 2016, randomly assigned 3325 patients to a monitoring protocol made more intensive by introducing new methods or increasing the frequency of existing follow-up protocols versus less invasive monitoring. No detectable difference in overall survival was associated with more intensive monitoring protocols (hazard ratio 0.98, 95 per cent c.i. 0.87 to 1.11).

Conclusion

Based on pooled data from randomized trials published from 1995 to 2016, the anticipated survival benefit from surgical treatment resulting from earlier detection of metastases has not been achieved.

### The American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons clinical practice guidelines for the management of colon cancer [^532d4a37]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2022). High credibility.

Evaluation and risk assessment — history, laboratory testing, and genetic risk: A cancer-specific history should be obtained including disease-specific symptoms, past medical and family history, physical examination, and perioperative medical risk, and routine laboratory values, including carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level, should be obtained; this is a strong recommendation based on moderate-quality evidence, 1B. Sporadic, familial, and hereditary colorectal cancer types account for approximately 65%, 30%, and < 5% of new colorectal cancers in the United States, respectively. The personal and family history should include documentation of premalignant lesions and cancers, age of diagnosis, and the lineage of affected first- and second-degree relatives, and patients should be asked about known hereditary cancer predisposition syndromes, previous genetic testing, and family ancestry/ethnicity. Patients with findings suggestive of an inherited susceptibility should be referred for genetic counseling. Among colon cancer patients younger than 50 years, up to one-third may carry a germline mutation associated with colon cancer.

### Is it reasonable to add preoperative serum level of CEA and CA19-9 to staging for colorectal cancer? [^89f919b5]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and carbohydrate antigen 19–9 (CA19-9) are the most common tumor markers for colorectal cancer. The aim of this study was to evaluate the possibility of adding them into the current staging system by analyzing their prognostic significance.

Materials and Methods

The study population was patients (n = 574, 67.1 ± 11.3 years old, 397 males) who received potentially curative resection of colorectal adenocarcinoma (stage I-III) between January 1994 and August 2002, including preoperative measurements of CEA and CA19-9. Clinicopathological characteristics and associated follow-up data were retrospectively collected by reviewing available medical charts. CEA higher or equal to 5 ng/ml was defined as abnormal (CEA+). The CA19-9 level was set at 37 U/ml (CA19-9+). Patients were further divided into four groups (1, 2, 3, 4) according to the results of these two markers (CEA/CA19-9: -/-, -/+, ±, and +/+). Survival was analyzed for AJCC staging, CEA (+) versus (-), CA19-9 (+) versus (-), and four groups.

Results

CEA and CA19-9 survival curves were not significantly different. However, the combined use of the two markers revealed a significant survival benefit (P = 0.035) of group 1 ("-" for both markers) over 4 ("+" for both) in stage II.

Conclusions

Patients with an elevated level of both CEA and CA19-9 in stage II of colorectal cancer have a significantly poorer prognosis than those with normal levels of these markers. We recommend adding both CEA and CA19-9 to the current staging system.

### Circulating tumor DNA, imaging, and carcinoembryonic antigen: comparison of surveillance strategies among patients who underwent resection of colorectal cancer – A systematic review and meta-analysis [^1f1e5398]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Almost one-third of colorectal cancer (CRC) patients experience recurrence after resection; nevertheless, follow-up strategies remain controversial. We sought to systematically assess and compare the accuracy of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), imaging [positron emission tomography (PET) and computed tomography (CT) scans], and circulating tumor DNA (CtDNA) as surveillance strategies.

Patients and Methods

PubMed, Medline, Embase, Scopus, Cochrane, Web of Science, and CINAHL were systematically searched. The Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 (QUADAS-2) was used to assess methodological quality. We performed a bivariate random-effects meta-analysis and reported pooled sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) values for each surveillance strategy.

Results

Thirty studies were included in the analysis. PET scans had the highest sensitivity to detect recurrence (0.95; 95%CI 0.91–0.97), followed by CT scans (0.77; 95%CI 0.67–0.85). CtDNA positivity had the highest specificity to detect recurrence (0.95; 95%CI 0.91–0.97), followed by increased CEA levels (0.88; 95%CI 0.82–0.92). Furthermore, PET scans had the highest DOR to detect recurrence (DOR 120.7; 95%CI 48.9–297.9) followed by CtDNA (DOR 37.6; 95%CI 20.8–68.0).

Conclusion

PET scans had the highest sensitivity and DOR to detect recurrence, while CtDNA had the highest specificity and second highest DOR. Combinations of traditional cross-sectional/functional imaging and newer platforms such as CtDNA may result in optimized surveillance of patients following resection of CRC.

### Colorectal cancer surveillance: 2005 update of an American Society of Clinical Oncology practice guideline [^0c576bfc]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose

To update the 2000 American Society of Clinical Oncology guideline on colorectal cancer surveillance.

Recommendations

Based on results from three independently reported meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials that compared low-intensity and high-intensity programs of colorectal cancer surveillance, and on recent analyses of data from major clinical trials in colon and rectal cancer, the Panel recommends annual computed tomography (CT) of the chest and abdomen for 3 years after primary therapy for patients who are at higher risk of recurrence and who could be candidates for curative-intent surgery; pelvic CT scan for rectal cancer surveillance, especially for patients with several poor prognostic factors, including those who have not been treated with radiation; colonoscopy at 3 years after operative treatment, and, if results are normal, every 5 years thereafter; flexible proctosigmoidoscopy every 6 months for 5 years for rectal cancer patients who have not been treated with pelvic radiation; history and physical examination every 3 to 6 months for the first 3 years, every 6 months during years 4 and 5, and subsequently at the discretion of the physician; and carcinoembryonic antigen every 3 months postoperatively for at least 3 years after diagnosis, if the patient is a candidate for surgery or systemic therapy. Chest x-rays, CBCs, and liver function tests are not recommended, and molecular or cellular markers should not influence the surveillance strategy based on available evidence.

### Effect of 5 years of CT-scan and CEA follow-up on survival endpoints in patients with colorectal cancer [^8d81e24d]. Annals of Oncology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Intensive follow-up of patients after curative surgery for colorectal cancer is recommended by various scientific societies. However, these recommendations are based mainly on expert opinions, while the results of the few clinical trials are controversial. Moreover, no survival benefit has been demonstrated to date.

Patients and Methods

PRODIGE-13 is a cooperative prospective multicentre controlled phase III trial evaluating by factorial plan the impact of i) intensive radiological monitoring (alternating abdominal ultrasound (US)/CT-scan/3m) versus standard monitoring (US/3m and thoracic radiography/6m) and ii) Carcinoembryonic Antigen (CEA) assessment versus no assessment, in the follow-up of resected stage II or III colorectal cancer with no evidence of residual disease on baseline post-surgical investigation in France and Belgium. The primary endpoint was 5-year overall survival (OS).

Results

Altogether, 2009 patients were randomized. Among them, 16% had rectal cancer, and 44% left colon cancer; 75.9% were less than 75 years old. With a median follow-up of 7.8 years, cancer recurred in 22.3% of patients (local 10.5%, metastatic 72.9%, both 16.6%). The 5-year OS rates were 82.1% (95%CI [78.5;85.2]) in group A (intensive imaging + CEA) vs. 84.1% (95%CI [80.5;87.0]) in group B (intensive imaging alone), vs. 83.6%, (95%CI [80.1;86.6]) in group C (standard imaging+ CEA) vs. 79.5% (95%CI [75.7;82.8]) in group D (standard imaging alone) (p(logrank) = 0.170. Median OS was not reached in the four groups, Five-year relapse-free survival (RFS) was 73.8% in the CT-scan surveillance group vs. 69.3% in the no-CT-scan group (HR 0.89 [0.76;1.03]; p = 0.108). Five-year RFS was 71.3% in the CEA surveillance group vs. 71.8% in the no-CEA group (HR 1.00 [0.86;1.16]; 0.959).

Conclusions

Among patients with stage II or III colorectal cancer, after curative surgery, the implementation of CEA and/or CT-scan surveillance did not provide any benefit in 5-year overall survival for the overall population of the study.

### Tumor markers… [^37579ce5]. training.seer.cancer.gov (2025). Medium credibility.

Tumor Markers Key Information Prognostic. CEA A blood test measuring the presence of an antigen in malignancies arising in endodermal or gastrointestinal tissue. Persistent elevated levels indicate residual or recurrent metastatic carcinoma. CEA assay is nonspecific for identifying a primary site, but it does indicate the presence of malignancy. Smokers may have an elevated CEA without malignant disease. Normal range: < 2. 5 ng/ml. Normal range may vary somewhat depending on the brand of assay used. Levels > 10 ng/ml suggest extensive disease and levels > 20 ng/ml suggest metastatic disease.

### Use of tumor markers in gastrointestinal cancers: surgeon perceptions and cost-benefit trade-off analysis [^26c59525]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2017). Low credibility.

Gastrointestinal cancers are the third most common cancers worldwide, with a prevalence of 1,281,539 in the US in 2013. Survival for gastrointestinal malignancies have been improving worldwide due to advances in multimodality treatments, diagnostic strategies and expanding the criteria for treatable disease. While these strategies commonly involve a combination of radiological and endoscopic techniques, some studies have shown serum tumor markers may have a diagnostic, as well as therapeutic, monitoring role.

A tumor marker is defined as a compound produced by the tumor or the host, in response to a malignancy. Traditionally, markers such as carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and, to a lesser extent, cancer antigen (CA) 19–9, have been used clinically to monitor disease response, whereby the efficacy of treatments can be assessed by noting a reduction in the level of a marker, which was previously high. In colorectal cancer, the use of tumor makers in postoperative surveillance has been recommended by the American Society of Clinical Oncology; however, their use in the identification of metastasis and diagnostic accuracy has not been establisheddespite some clinicians incorporating them into regular practice. In contrast, the use of tumor markers in esophagogastric malignancies in any capacity remains controversial. A number of studies have assessed the use of several tumor markers in prognosis and diagnosis, however they are of limited quality. As such, there is no clear consensus on the use of tumor markers, and current practice is dependent on the individual clinician's choice.

In both cancer types, there is hence a clear need for an objective evaluation of common tumor markers in several clinical scenarios. This appraisal requires a comparison of clinical utility and costs or negatives with the utilization of the marker; however the relative importance of these benefits and costs, or performance characteristics, as drivers to uptake has not yet been quantified by the literature and would be dependent on how clinicians perceive the use of tumor markers. This study aimed to critically assess the cost-benefit trade-off of three common tumor markers in gastrointestinal cancers by means of evaluating the perceptions of surgeons to common markers.

### New insights into the role of age and carcinoembryonic antigen in the prognosis of colorectal cancer [^28a28541]. British Journal of Cancer (2008). Low credibility.

The third main result of this study is the independent predictive value of postsurgery CEA levels. In our multivariate analysis the postoperative level of CEA replaced that of postoperative CA19-9 as the major determinant (with a statistically relevant weight for relative survival), although the two had apparently similar prognostic roles at univariate analysis. In most of the previous studies aimed at evaluating the implications of CEA levels for staging and prognosis, the serum concentration of CEA was evaluated preoperatively and, despite some conflicting results, the majority of them showed a direct prognostic value (a nice review on this topic is available in a recent paper by). Since the CEA level seems to roughly reflect the tumour burden and/or diffusion, its preoperative evaluation might offer a crude estimate of neoplastic spread and, thus, of the probable difficulty of achieving successful radical resection. A drop in CEA levels after the resection is considered a favourable indicator of the completeness of the surgical excision, although CEA concentration is generally regarded as more sensitive for hepatic and retroperitoneal metastases than for local recurrence or peritoneal and pulmonary metastases. According to, the measurement of the CEA level in the blood intraoperatively taken from the mesenteric vein offers some advantage, as both indicator of hepatic metastases and predictor of 5-year survival. The same investigators also found a higher recurrence rate in patients with both high CEA levels and positive citology in peritoneal washings taken at the beginning of surgery. Several patients in the present series were referred to our unit from a neighbouring hospital with preoperative CEA often not technically comparable or even not assessed. However, we know that apart from cases with documented distant metastases (stage IV), some patients have CEA levels higher than normal after putatively radical operations, without any instrumental macroscopic evidence of persisting local residual disease or distant spread. Since the half-life of CEA serum level has been calculated to be a few days – from 3.0 to 4.3 or 6.2 – our evaluation at a mean interval of 42 days after surgery – and rarely after less than 4 weeks – seems able to reliably reflect the presence of occult spread of the disease. In such cases, the clinical problem is whether to plan adjuvant therapy according to the TNM stage only or whether to consider also the altered marker value as an important worsening factor.

### Meta-analysis of colorectal cancer follow-up after potentially curative resection [^37418a02]. The British Journal of Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Abstract

Background

After potentially curative resection of primary colorectal cancer, patients may be monitored by measurement of carcinoembryonic antigen and/or CT to detect asymptomatic metastatic disease earlier.

Methods

A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to find evidence for the clinical effectiveness of monitoring in advancing the diagnosis of recurrence and its effect on survival. MEDLINE (Ovid), Embase, the Cochrane Library, Web of Science and other databases were searched for randomized comparisons of increased intensity monitoring compared with a contemporary standard policy after resection of primary colorectal cancer.

Results

There were 16 randomized comparisons, 11 with published survival data. More intensive monitoring advanced the diagnosis of recurrence by a median of 10 (i.q.r. 5–24) months. In ten of 11 studies the authors reported no demonstrable difference in overall survival. Seven RCTs, published from 1995 to 2016, randomly assigned 3325 patients to a monitoring protocol made more intensive by introducing new methods or increasing the frequency of existing follow-up protocols versus less invasive monitoring. No detectable difference in overall survival was associated with more intensive monitoring protocols (hazard ratio 0.98, 95 per cent c.i. 0.87 to 1.11).

Conclusion

Based on pooled data from randomized trials published from 1995 to 2016, the anticipated survival benefit from surgical treatment resulting from earlier detection of metastases has not been achieved.

Less common ovarian cancers (LCOC) — workup for a pelvic mass mirrors that for other ovarian cancers but includes targeted tumor markers and assessments. Tumor markers may include CA-125, inhibin, beta-hCG, alpha-fetoprotein, and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). Individuals younger than 35 years with a pelvic mass should have AFP levels measured to assess for germ cell tumors and to rule out pregnancy. A GI tract evaluation is recommended for mucinous histology to determine whether an occult GI primary has metastasized to the ovaries. An intraoperative frozen section evaluation is recommended for those who would like to maintain their fertility.

### Follow-up and surveillance of the patient with lung cancer after curative-intent therapy: diagnosis and management of lung cancer, 3rd ed: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^cc1cc2f2]. Chest (2013). Medium credibility.

Biomarkers and postoperative carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) for risk-stratified surveillance after curative therapy are discussed, noting uncertainty about testing intervals and that several biomarkers predict a higher risk for recurrence. In one study, postoperative serum levels of CEA ≤ 2.5 ng/mL and absence of vascular invasion predicted no recurrence of stage I lung adenocarcinoma; using a cutoff of 2.5 ng/mL, nine of 16 cases (56%) showed disease recurrence, whereas six of 120 cases (5%) showed recurrence at levels ≤ 2.5 ng/mL, suggesting less-intense surveillance for the low-CEA group. If results are replicated in additional studies, such a strategy might be recommended for selecting patients for more-intense follow-up as well as for selecting patients for adjuvant chemotherapy.

### Evaluation of comparative surveillance strategies of circulating tumor DNA, imaging, and carcinoembryonic antigen levels in patients with resected colorectal cancer [^bcd5a532]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Conclusions

The findings of this prospective cohort study suggest that ctDNA assay may not provide definitive advantages as a surveillance strategy compared with standard imaging combined with measurement of CEA levels when performed per NCCN guidelines. The correlation between low-burden lung recurrence and negative ctDNA findings should be investigated further in larger prospective studies.

### Preoperative carcinoembryonic antigen as a poor prognostic factor in stage I-III colorectal cancer after curative-intent resection: a propensity score matching analysis [^d98e7a73]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Preoperative carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) has yet to be used as a prognostic or adjuvant chemotherapy factor for colorectal cancer (CRC).

Methods

This retrospective cohort study included all stage I-III CRC patients with different preoperative serum CEA levels (≤ 5, 5–10, and > 10 ng/ml) at a single center between 1995 and 2010. Propensity score matching was performed in a 1:1 ratio between the two elevated CEA groups (5–10 ng/ml and > 10 ng/ml) and in a 1:2 ratio between the elevated and non-elevated groups (≤ 5 ng/ml), with a caliper of 0.05.

Results

After exclusion and matching, 3857 patients had preoperative CEA levels ≤ 5 ng/ml, 1121 patients had CEA levels between 5 and 10 ng/ml, and 1121 patients had CEA levels > 10 ng/ml. Elevated preoperative CEA showed an increased risk of overall survival (5–10 ng/ml: hazard ratio [HR] 1.376; > 10 ng/ml: HR 1.523; both p < 0.001), cancer-specific survival (5–10 ng/ml: HR 1.404; > 10 ng/ml: HR 1.712; both p < 0.001), and recurrence free interval (5–10 ng/ml: HR 1.190; > 10 ng/ml: HR 1.468; both p < 0.05). Patients with negative lymph node staging (LNs) and CEA > 10 ng/ml, as well as those with positive LNs and CEA ≤ 5 ng/ml, showed similar overall survival (5-year survival: 72% vs. 69%; p = 0.542) and recurrence free intervals (19.9 vs. 21.72 months; p = 0.662).

Conclusions

A preoperative CEA level can be an independent prognostic factor for stage I-III CRC after curative resection. Patients with negative LNs and preoperative CEA level > 10 ng/ml should be considered for intensive follow-up or adjuvant chemotherapy.

### Prognostic role of carcinoembryonic antigen and carbohydrate antigen 19–9 in metastatic colorectal cancer: a BRAF-mutant subset with high CA 19–9 level and poor outcome [^ceefba2b]. British Journal of Cancer (2018). Low credibility.

We are aware of some limitations for CA 19–9 as a biomarker, since several benign diseases may also give rise to elevated levels, and CA 19–9 is not expressed in subjects with Le (a-b-) genotype in the Lewis blood group system. In this study, the Lewis blood-type status of the patient cohort was unknown. Nine percent of the patients in our cohort had no detectable CA 19–9 as judged by the lower reference value, and in a clinical routine setting, these patients will be reckoned as having a very low serum level of CA 19–9 below a detection limit, but it will not be possible to distinguish between patients with very low CA 19–9 levels from those who do not express CA 19–9 due to their Lewis blood type. This subgroup of patients had clinical characteristics and outcome that did not differ significantly from the total population with detectable levels of CA 19–9, suggesting that it included patients across the total population and not specifically those with a low CA 19–9 level.

Serum CA 19–9, alone or in combination with markers of systemic inflammation, can be useful in the management of patients with BRAF -mutant, primary unresectable mCRC. We believe that the findings are of general relevance, although the underlying chemotherapy regimen in the present study is not commonly used outside the Nordic countries. Elevated serum CA 19–9 level may help to identify patients with a highly aggressive disease, like those who should be considered for intensive first-line therapy, such as the triple combination FOLFOXIRI. In conclusion, integrated prognostic data, including the CEA and CA 19–9 biomarkers, may give more accurate information about the disease and can be useful in shared decision-making, enabling patient and clinician to establish an optimal treatment plan.

### Clinical usefulness of postoperative serum carcinoembryonic antigen in patients with colorectal cancer with liver metastases [^eb6ce316]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Colorectal cancer with liver metastasis (CLM) has high postoperative recurrence rates; therefore, optimizing perioperative treatment is imperative. Postoperative carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) can aid in detecting minimal residual disease in colon cancer following curative resection. This study aimed to identify the potential role of serum CEA following liver resection in patients with CLM.

Methods

This retrospective study was conducted at the Cancer Institute Hospital of the Japanese Foundation for Cancer Research from 2004 to 2018 and enrolled patients with CLM who underwent complete resection of primary tumors and CLM. Associations between perioperative CEA levels and characteristics of recurrence were investigated.

Results

Recurrence was detected during a median follow-up period of 90.1 months in 343 (54.2%) out of 633 analyzed patients. Patients in the postoperative CEA level > 5 ng/ml group had a significantly higher recurrence rate (75.7% versus 50.0%, p < 0.01) and shorter time until recurrence (4.4 versus 36.9 months, p < 0.01) than those in the postoperative CEA level ≤ 5 ng/ml group. Multivariate analysis revealed that postoperative CEA level > 5 ng/ml was an independent predictor, with hazard ratios of 2.77 (p < 0.01) for recurrence-free survival (RFS) and 3.18 (p < 0.01) for overall survival (OS). Additionally, RFS was significantly shorter among patients in the postoperative CEA level > 5 ng/ml group who did not have normalized CEA levels following adjuvant chemotherapy than among those in the normalized CEA group.

Conclusions

The postoperative and post-adjuvant chemotherapy CEA levels in the CEA level > 5 ng/ml group may be predictors of RFS and OS.

### Association between the tumor marker carcinoembryonic antigen and the risk of dementia [^71965208]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2020). Medium credibility.

There is an ongoing debate about how cancer and dementia relate to each other, and whether their relation is biologically determined or caused by surveillance and survival bias. We aimed to circumvent these biases by determining the relation between the tumor marker carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and the risk of dementia in 6,692 participants from the population-based Rotterdam Study. We found that higher levels of CEA were associated with a higher risk of dementia (HR per standard deviation increase in CEA = 1.11, 95% CI 1.04; 1.18). This finding may indicate that cancer and dementia are positively associated, but the mechanisms underlying the relation between CEA and dementia warrant further investigation.

### Colon cancer, version 3.2024, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^65a87637]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2024). High credibility.

Randomized trials of surveillance intensity after resected stage I–III CRC show detection benefits without clear survival improvement: in the randomized controlled FACS trial of 1202 patients, intensive surveillance imaging or carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) screening increased curative-intent surgery rates versus minimum follow-up, but no advantage was seen in the CEA and CT combination arm (2.3% in the minimum follow-up group, 6.7% in the CEA group, 8% in the CT group, and 6.6% in the CEA plus CT group), and no mortality benefit was observed compared with minimum follow-up (death rate, 18.2% vs. 15.9%; difference, 2.3%; 95% CI, −2.6%–7.1%). The randomized COLOFOL trial of 2509 patients compared a high-frequency approach (CT and CEA at 6, 12, 18, 24, and 36 months post-surgery) with a low-frequency approach (CT and CEA at 12 and 36 months post-surgery) and reported no significant difference in 5-year overall mortality or CRC-specific mortality. The CEAwatch trial compared usual follow-up to CEA every 2 months in 3223 patients at 11 hospitals and found more recurrences detected, more that could be treated with curative intent, and shorter time to detection under intensive CEA surveillance; another randomized trial of 1228 patients showed earlier detection with more intensive surveillance but did not affect OS.

### Increased serum carcinoembryonic antigen levels as an early sign of medullary thyroid carcinoma [^32928cda]. Endocrine Practice (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To emphasize the potential association between increased levels of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and the presence of medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC).

Methods

We present two case reports of this association, including long-term serial measurements of CEA in one patient.

Results

CEA is a tumor marker often associated with colon cancer. In recent years, increased CEA in plasma has been reported in patients with other cancers. Diagnoses of MTC in two patients were preceded by increased CEA levels (for 6 years in one patient). Because CEA levels returned to normal after thyroidectomy, MTC may have been the cause of the increases.

Conclusion

In patients with increased plasma CEA levels, MTC should be considered in the differential diagnosis even if thyroid palpation is nonrevealing and thyroid function is normal.

### Tumor marker ordering: Do not lose control: a prospective clinical trial [^bbeaee0d]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2015). Low credibility.

Objectives

In this study, we evaluated the extent of inappropriate tumor marker (TM) ordering in a secondary care setting, approximately 6 years after the introduction of local guidelines, and we identified the main factors potentially influencing clinicians when performing an inappropriate TM request.

Methods

For this purpose, we regularly checked all requests containing more than two TMs. During the 21-month audit, the rate of rejected requests amounted to 3.6%. Several of those were performed for diagnostic purposes. The most frequent and inappropriately requested TMs were carcinoembryonic antigen and carbohydrate antigen 19.9.

Results

The inappropriateness of requests appeared to be linked to the need for more education and knowledge on their clinical applicability and limitations. The clinical motivation was generally associated with patients displaying nonspecific signs/symptoms (ie, weight loss with worsening general conditions), having an incidentally positive result to some recently performed TM tests, or being tested by a TM to avoid more expensive diagnostic imaging procedures.

Conclusions

Our data show that real-time control and management of inappropriate requests by laboratory professionals may be relevant to increase the clinical efficacy of TM testing and useful in perspective to drive the introduction of new validated biomarkers.

### Persistent elevation of carcinoembryonic antigen as first presentation of a medullary thyroid carcinoma [^3aa1cb56]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) is still the most widely used tumour marker for gastrointestinal cancer. CEA was originally thought to be a specific marker for colorectal cancer, but it turned out to be a non-specific marker for further studies. CEA levels can be elevated in breast, lung and liver cancers, among others, including medullary thyroid cancer. The authors report a case of a 73-year-old woman who had a right hemicolectomy for an ascending colon adenocarcinoma and showed a persistent elevation in the CEA marker during follow-up. After several imaging tests, recurrence of the colon cancer was not found, but the presence of thyroid nodules had been detected. The diagnosis of a medullary thyroid carcinoma was made after the finding of a high value of calcitonin. The patient had a total thyroidectomy with resection of the central and lateral lymph nodes.

### Choosing wisely in oncology: are guidelines effective at preventing unnecessary diagnostics? The example of surveillance positron emission tomography for patients with localised colorectal cancer [^6f06b1f0]. BMJ Oncology (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

In all healthcare systems around the world, using appropriate diagnostic approaches is important for both patients and payers. For patients, it is important to balance the need to diagnose serious disease, against the risk of overdiagnosis. For payers, the costs of using diagnostic testing must be balanced against the clinical benefit that the testing provides. For healthcare systems with finite availability of certain tests, the appropriate policy must ensure that such tests are available for those that need them. It has been well recognised that sometimes, there is overuse of certain diagnostic techniques. In order to provide a framework to consider such overuse, the 'Choosing Wisely' campaign was developed by the American Board of Internal Medicine, and its recommendations have been adopted by many professional organisations around the world. The recommendations have been considered to be only for advisory purposes to guide clinician decision-making.

In the field of oncology, many 'Choosing Wisely' recommendations focus on the appropriate use of advanced imaging technologies such as positron emission tomography (PETCT). One such recommendation specifically stated in 2013 ' Avoid using PET or PET-CT scanning as part of routine follow-up care to monitor for a cancer recurrence in asymptomatic patients who have finished initial treatment to eliminate the cancer unless there is high-level evidence that such imaging will change the outcome'. In the field of colorectal cancer (CRC), it is recommended that patients treated with surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy should not undergo surveillance with PETCT imaging. This recommendation against surveillance PETCT is supported by guidelines of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, The European Society of Medical Oncology, The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN), American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons, The Society of Surgical Oncologyand The Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain and Ireland. The recommendations are underpinned by randomised controlled clinical trial data reported in 2018 by Sobhani et al. In this study, 239 patients undergoing surveillance with physical examination, liver ultrasound, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and CT were randomised to groups with or without PETCT every 6 months. There was no difference in rates of unresectable recurrence or death from any cause.

### Serum carcinoembryonic antigen monitoring after curative resection for colorectal cancer: clinical significance of the preoperative level [^80e6ab1e]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2009). Low credibility.

Aim

We evaluated preoperative serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) as a prognostic factor for colorectal cancer and determined when surveillance of this marker was useful.

Methods

Serum CEA was measured preoperatively in 1,263 patients who underwent curative resection for colorectal cancer at 3-month intervals for the first 2 postoperative years and at 6-month intervals thereafter. Mean follow-up was 48 months (range 1–156 months).

Results

The 5-year disease-free survival was less in patients with a high preoperative serum CEA level (P < 0.0001). Among patients with a tumor recurrence, 38.5% had high follow-up serum CEA levels. The number of patients with high postoperative serum CEA levels exceeded the number of patients with high preoperative levels. High preoperative and follow-up serum CEA levels were independent prognostic factors for tumor recurrence (P = 0.003 and P < 0.001, respectively). In patients with high preoperative serum CEA levels, CEA surveillance had a 92.3% positive predictive value (PPV) and a 96.1% negative predictive value (NPV). The mean interval between postoperative serum CEA elevation and the diagnosis of a tumor recurrence [diagnostic interval (DI)] was 2.5 months (range 5–17 months). The DI was 0 in 18.8% of patients with a tumor recurrence.

Conclusion

High serum CEA levels preoperatively and at follow-up are prognostic factors for colorectal cancer. Postoperative serum CEA surveillance is used most effectively when patients have high preoperative serum CEA levels. Considering the DI of 0 in 18.8% of the patients, the current CEA surveillance schedule might be changed.

### Diagnostic accuracy of serum-carcinoembryonic antigen in recurrent colorectal cancer: a receiver operating characteristic curve analysis [^fce4204e]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Serial measurements of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) are frequently used in the follow-up after colorectal cancer (CRC), but its usefulness remains debatable. Choosing the appropriate cut-off point is crucial to the diagnostic accuracy (DA) of continuous test variables. Receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis is the appropriate statistical method for this purpose, but has not been applied in previous studies.

Methods

One hundred ninety-four consecutive patients surgically treated with curative intent for CRC between July 1996 and June 1999 had systematic follow-up for five years. Follow-up included imaging, coloscopy and serial CEA measurements. Complete data including CEA measurements were available from 153 patients. ROC analysis of CEA was done with regard to detection of recurrent disease.

Results

Depending on the chosen cut-off value of CEA, DA varied widely within the normal range (CEA ≤ 10 U/ml). CEA > 4 U/ml provided the highest sensitivity (0.78) and specificity (0.91), compared to a sensitivity and specificity at the upper normal range (CEA = 10 U/ml) of 0.51 and 0.99, respectively. Thirty-three patients (24%) developed recurrence. Among 11 (5%) asymptomatic patients diagnosed by elevated CEA levels, only two patients (1.5%) were amenable to secondary curative surgery. A threefold increase of CEA in an individual patient had the same DA as the best cut-off value (> 4 U/ml).

Conclusions

Diagnostic accuracy of CEA in follow-up after curative surgery for CRC is influenced by the chosen cut-off value. A threefold increase of CEA may indicate recurrent disease. The value of serial measurement of CEA was limited.

Methods

Study Design and Patient Selection

The current study was an open-label, nonblinded, proof-of-principle, phase 1 nonrandomized controlled trial performed in patients 18 years or older at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia from August 1, 2020, to January 31, 2022. The trial protocol appears in Supplement 1. Details on immunohistochemistry, The Cancer Genome Atlas analysis, inclusion and exclusion criteria, fluorochrome parameters, camera systems used, and outcomes analyzed are detailed in the eMethods in Supplement 2. Data on race and ethnicity were not collected because this was a cellular molecular study and such data would not be informative. The study was reviewed and approved by the University of Pennsylvania Institutional Review Board in accordance with Good Clinical Practice guidelines as outlined by the International Council of Harmonization of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use in addition to laws and regulations for human research by the state of Pennsylvania and the FDA. All patients were informed of the risks, benefits, and alternatives regarding the interventions in the study. Participants enrolled in the study signed written informed consent forms approved by the University of Pennsylvania Institutional Review Board before initiation of the trial. The rationale, background, methods, design, analysis, and interpretation of the study follow the recommendations set by the Transparent Reporting of Evaluations With Nonrandomized Designs (TREND) reporting guideline.

Study Groups

In this nonrandomized controlled trial, the first group (positive control) included patients with known primary or recurrent gastrointestinal adenocarcinoma (colon, rectal, and pancreatic adenocarcinoma) with or without elevated serum CEA levels who were found to have nodules suggestive of pulmonary metastases. The second group included patients with nodules suggestive of malignant primary pulmonary disease on screening imaging who were scheduled for surgical resection regardless of serum CEA status. Of note, our institutional practice does not include preoperative nodule sampling.

NIR Tracer

SGM-101 was manufactured in accordance with Good Laboratory Practice guidelines and supplied by Surgimab. The SGM-101 active ingredient is a covalent conjugate of the SGM-Ch511 anti-CEACAM5 chimeric monoclonal antibody with the fluorochrome BM-104. Patients in this study were administered 10 mg of SGM-101 intravenously for 30 minutes followed by a 50-mL flush of isotonic saline to account for the dead volume of the tubing. Patients were administered SGM-101 3 to 5 days (± 1 day) before surgery at the Center for Health and Precision Surgery and monitored for a minimum of 1-hour after infusion.

### Association of preoperative and postoperative serum carcinoembryonic antigen and colon cancer outcome [^cebb1497]. JAMA Oncology (2018). Medium credibility.

Importance

Guidelines recommend measuring preoperative carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) in patients with colon cancer. Although persistently elevated CEA after surgery has been associated with increased risk for metastatic disease, prognostic significance of elevated preoperative CEA that normalized after resection is unknown.

Objective

To investigate whether patients with elevated preoperative CEA that normalizes after colon cancer resection have a higher risk of recurrence than patients with normal preoperative CEA.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This retrospective cohort analysis was conducted at a comprehensive cancer center. Consecutive patients with colon cancer who underwent curative resection for stage I to III colon adenocarcinoma at the center from January 2007 to December 2014 were identified.

Exposures

Patients were grouped into 3 cohorts: normal preoperative CEA, elevated preoperative but normalized postoperative CEA, and elevated preoperative and postoperative CEA.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Three-year recurrence-free survival (RFS) and hazard function curves over time were analyzed.

Results

A total of 1027 patients (461 [50.4%] male; median [IQR] age, 64 [53–75] years) were identified. Patients with normal preoperative CEA had 7.4% higher 3-year RFS (n = 715 [89.7%]) than the combined cohorts with elevated preoperative CEA (n = 312 [82.3%]) (P = 0.01) but had RFS similar to that of patients with normalized postoperative CEA (n = 142 [87.9%]) (P = 0.86). Patients with elevated postoperative CEA had 14.9% lower RFS (n = 57 [74.5%]) than the combined cohorts with normal postoperative CEA (n = 857 [89.4%]) (P = 0.001). The hazard function of recurrence for elevated postoperative CEA peaked earlier than for the other cohorts. Multivariate analyses confirmed that elevated postoperative CEA (hazard ratio [HR], 2.0; 95% CI, 1.1–3.5), but not normalized postoperative CEA (HR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.45–1.30), was independently associated with shorter RFS.

Conclusions and Relevance

Elevated preoperative CEA that normalizes after resection is not an indicator of poor prognosis. Routine measurement of postoperative, rather than preoperative, CEA is warranted. Patients with elevated postoperative CEA are at increased risk for recurrence, especially within the first 12 months after surgery.

### Evaluation of comparative surveillance strategies of circulating tumor DNA, imaging, and carcinoembryonic antigen levels in patients with resected colorectal cancer [^6189c220]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Limitations

Our study is limited by its small size, small number of recurrences, and short follow-up. We defined ctDNA-detected recurrence as a true recurrence despite the lack of a mandate of a radiographic progression; however, our decision to proceed with such a definition was based on supporting evidence that persistent ctDNA positivity has been associated with recurrence in all patients in 2 studies. In addition, delayed recurrences have been seen in patients with colorectal cancer, although infrequently. Hence, the lack of radiographic recurrence, even at 5 years, in a patient with persistent ctDNA positivity does not preclude the presence of minimal residual disease or later recurrences. Nonetheless, all our patients with ctDNA-detected relapses did eventually experience radiographic recurrence and hence represent true-positive findings by radiographic criteria, adding further strength to our findings. Our statistical analysis did not show any significant difference in sensitivity and specificity between measurement of CEA levels and ctDNA, as well as combined measurement of CEA levels and imaging, probably reflecting that our analysis is underpowered by the small sample size. Additional limitations include the heterogenous patient population by stage and treatment, which may limit the generalization of our data within different populations with colorectal cancer. Nonetheless, the correlation between low-burden lung recurrence and negative ctDNA findings is striking and calls for larger prospective studies to assess the sensitivity of ctDNA vs standard of care surveillance. Such studies should be standardized to include intensive surveillance approaches as supported by NCCN and ESMO guidelines.

### Conditional survival and the prognostic value of serum carcinoembryonic antigen level in oldest old with colorectal cancer [^743d5922]. BMC Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common malignancy worldwide. As the average lifespan increases, the number of elderly patients (≥ 85 years old) with CRC has also increased. Patients aged 85 and above are often considered the oldest-old.

In the United States, the median age of diagnosis of colorectal cancer is 67 years, and 11.2% of new cases occur in individuals over the age of 84. The oldest-old category comprises 20.6% of the total deaths caused by CRC. The oldest-old is a specific population in CRC, characterized by multiple comorbidities with increased postoperative morbidity and mortality. Moreover, the Tumor-Node-Metastasis (TNM) staging system developed by the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) is inadequate for accurately assessing the prognosis of CRC Therefore, there is a need for improvement of the current staging system.

Serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) is a highly glycosylated 201 kDa antigen expressed on the apical surface of colon epithelial cells and excreted through the intestinal cavity. CEA is the most widely used blood-based molecular marker for CRC and has been shown to play an important role in monitoring disease progression and predicting disease prognosis. The AJCC Colorectal Working Group recommended the inclusion of serum CEA levels (C stage) to complement and modify the anatomic TNM staging of CRC in early 2000.

The present study was a large population-based study designed to evaluate the clinical value of serum CEA levels and their impact on the diagnostic value of the conventional TNM staging system in the oldest-old patients with CRC.

### CA 19–9 as a marker in addition to CEA to monitor colorectal cancer [^c122f9ec]. Clinical Colorectal Cancer (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Carcinoembryonic antigen is the commonly used tumor marker in patients with colorectal cancer, and CA 19–9 might be an additional marker. The aim of this retrospective study was to investigate whether CA 19–9 levels can be used to monitor the disease process in patients with colorectal cancer who had no elevated CEA levels. The secondary aim was to determine if preoperative increased levels of CEA and CA 19–9 were associated with mortality.

Materials and Methods

Two sets of data from patients with histologically confirmed colorectal cancer, were included in a single-center study. First, patients with a minimum of 3 serial measurements of CA 19–9 and CEA tumor markers were related to the clinical course of their disease. Second, patients with preoperative levels of CEA and CA 19–9 were related to survival.

Results

In patients with colorectal cancer and 3 serial measurements of tumor markers, 7.3% had only increased CA 19–9 levels without increased CEA levels, and 55.4% of the patients had an increase of CA 19–9 and CEA levels. In the patients with available preoperative markers, patients with only an increase of CA 19–9 had a significantly decreased 5-year survival compared with patients with an increase of only CEA (P = 0.013).

Conclusion

CA 19–9 can be used as additional marker to follow the disease process in patients with colorectal cancer without an increase in CEA level. Patients with preoperative increased CA 19–9 level had a poorer 5-year survival than patients with preoperative increased CEA levels.

### Evaluation of comparative surveillance strategies of circulating tumor DNA, imaging, and carcinoembryonic antigen levels in patients with resected colorectal cancer [^e26d7ed2]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Importance

A circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) assay (Signatera; Natera) has been marketed for use in the surveillance of resected colorectal cancer despite limited data supporting such practice.

Objective

To compare a ctDNA assay with standard radiographic imaging and measurement of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels, per National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines, in the surveillance of resected colorectal cancer.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This retrospective, single-center cohort study evaluated surveillance strategies of ctDNA, imaging, and measurement of CEA levels in patients with resected colorectal cancer from September 1, 2019, to November 30, 2021.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The sensitivity and specificity of ctDNA, imaging, measurement of CEA levels, and combination of imaging plus measurement of CEA levels in detecting a confirmed recurrence of colorectal disease. A confirmed recurrence was defined asa positivectDNA finding or a finding on imaging confirmed by biopsy, CEA level elevation, or subsequent tumor radiographic dynamics.

Results

A total of 48 patients with curatively resected colorectal cancer satisfied the inclusion criteria for this study (28 men [58.3%]; median age, 60 [IQR, 34–85] years) and underwent surveillance by ctDNA, imaging, and measurement of CEA levels. Fifteen patients had disease recurrence during surveillance. Positive ctDNA findings confirmed disease recurrence in 8 patients; imaging, in 9 patients; CEA levels, in 3 patients; and combined imaging plus CEA levels, in 11 patients. Numerically, ctDNA did not perform better than imaging in detecting recurrence, with sensitivities of 53.3% (95% CI, 27.4%-77.7%) and 60.0% (95% CI, 32.9%-82.5%), respectively (P > .99). The combination of imaging plus measurement of CEA levels (sensitivity, 73.3% [95% CI, 44.8%-91.1%]) had a numerical advantage compared with ctDNA in identifying recurrence (P = 0.55). In addition, no significant difference was noted among ctDNA (median, 14.3 months), imaging (median, 15.0 months), or imaging plus measurement of CEA levels (median, 15.0 months) in the time to identify disease recurrence.

Conclusions and Relevance

The findings of this cohort study suggest that ctDNA assay may not provide advantages as a surveillance strategy compared with standard imaging combined with CEA levels when performed per National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: breast cancer, version 5.2025 [^c8a14d63]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

NCCN Invasive Breast Cancer — findings concerning for progression of metastatic disease — findings concerning for progression of disease include worsening symptoms such as pain or dyspnea, evidence of worsening or new disease on physical examination, declining performance status, unexplained weight loss, increasing alkaline phosphatase, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), or bilirubin, hypercalcemia, new radiographic abnormality or increase in the size of pre-existing radiographic abnormality, new areas of abnormality on functional imaging (eg, bone scan, PET/CT), and increasing tumor markers (eg, carcinoembryonic antigen [CEA], CA 15–3, CA 27.29). Rising tumor markers (eg, CEA, CA 15–3, CA 27.29) are concerning for tumor progression, but may also be seen in the setting of responding disease, and an isolated increase in tumor markers should rarely be used to declare progression of disease; changes in bone lesions are often difficult to assess on plain or cross-sectional radiology or on bone scan, and for these reasons, patient symptoms and serum tumor markers may be more helpful in patients with bone-dominant metastatic disease.

### Prediction of prognosis and surgical indications for pulmonary metastasectomy from colorectal cancer [^5cff2e7a]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Treatment of pulmonary metastases from colorectal cancer by excision has increased rapidly, but reports on indications and prognostic factors are inconsistent. We sought to identify poor prognostic factors preoperatively and to retrospectively evaluate preoperative clinical indications for surgery.

Methods

A total of 75 patients with colorectal cancer had pulmonary metastases excised from 1986 to 2003. Tumor size, number, laterality, hilar or mediastinal lymphadenopathy, and carcinoembryonic antigen level were possible risk factors for metastatic tumors, with primary site of colorectal tumor, disease-free interval, and hepatectomy for liver metastasis possible risk factors for primary tumors. Prognostic factors in univariate and multivariate analyses also included age and sex.

Results

Five-year survival rates were 41.3% after pulmonary excision and 73.1% after primary colorectal resection. Three factors identified as significant by univariate log-rank test for overall survival after pulmonary resection were carcinoembryonic antigen (p < 0.0001), tumor laterality (p = 0.0205), and number of pulmonary metastases (p = 0.0028). Multivariate analysis found that carcinoembryonic antigen, tumor number, tumor size, and patient's age were also independent prognostic factors. In contrast, carcinoembryonic antigen, number of metastases, and disease-free interval predicted prognosis after primary colorectal resection. Prior hepatectomy for metastases did not influence prognosis after pulmonary metastasectomy.

Conclusions

Elevated carcinoembryonic antigen level and multiple metastases are preoperative predictors of poor prognosis after resection of pulmonary metastases from colorectal cancer. Survival rate is sufficient to justify pulmonary metastasectomy if there is no local or distant metastatic lesion other than in the liver; if needed, sequential pulmonary and hepatic metastasectomy can be performed.

### Soluble carcinoembryonic antigen activates endothelial cells and tumor angiogenesis [^d3c247e5]. Cancer Research (2013). Low credibility.

Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA, CD66e, CEACAM-5) is a cell-surface-bound glycoprotein overexpressed and released by many solid tumors that has an autocrine function in cancer cell survival and differentiation. Soluble CEA released by tumors is present in the circulation of patients with cancer, where it is used as a marker for cancer progression, but whether this form of CEA exerts any effects in the tumor microenvironment is unknown. Here, we present evidence that soluble CEA is sufficient to induce proangiogenic endothelial cell behaviors, including adhesion, spreading, proliferation, and migration in vitro and tumor microvascularization in vivo. CEA-induced activation of endothelial cells was dependent on integrin β-3 signals that activate the focal-adhesion kinase and c-Src kinase and their downstream MAP-ERK kinase/extracellular signal regulated kinase and phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt effector pathways. Notably, while interference with VEGF signaling had no effect on CEA-induced endothelial cell activation, downregulation with the CEA receptor in endothelial cells attenuated CEA-induced signaling and tumor angiogenesis. Corroborating these results clinically, we found that tumor microvascularization was higher in patients with colorectal cancer exhibiting higher serum levels of soluble CEA. Together, our results elucidate a novel function for soluble CEA in tumor angiogenesis.

### 'FLARE' of tumor marker in advanced gastric cancer treated with first-line systemic therapy [^439f08de]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Transient tumor marker elevations caused by chemotherapy were defined as 'Flare' and have been demonstrated in some solid tumors. In clinical practice, we observed that some patients were accompanied by elevated tumor markers during treatment, but subsequent imaging proved that the treatment they received was effective.

Objectives

We aimed to study the Flare and the prognosis in advanced gastric cancer.

Design

This is an observational retrospective study. A total of 167 patients were enrolled in this study. Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), carbohydrate antigen (CA) 19–9 and CA125 values were obtained before the first, second, third, fourth, fifth and sixth cycles of treatment, respectively.

Methods

Imaging for the first efficacy assessment was reviewed according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) criteria. Kaplan-Meier analyses and log-rank tests were performed for overall survival (OS) analyses. Univariate and multivariate Cox analyses were used to determine the prognostic factor for OS and progression-free survival (PFS).

Results

37.1% of patients were accompanied with at least one tumor marker Flare during the course of treatment. The median time to tumor marker peak was 24-30days and the Flare duration lasted 49-53days. Patients with tumor markers Flare had a worse OS. Flare may be associated with the use of 5-fluorouracil. Baseline CEA and CA125 levels were the independent prognostic factors for OS and baseline CA125 level was the independent prognostic factor for PFS.

Conclusion

Initial elevation of tumor markers during treatment is not an indication of tumor progression. Patients with tumor markers 'Flare' may had a worse OS.

### Does serum CA19-9 play a practical role in the management of patients with colorectal cancer? [^1dd7123e]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose

CA19-9 is often used in combination with carcinoembryonic antigen to manage patients with colorectal cancer, even though there is insufficient evidence to support this use of CA19-9. Carcinoembryonic antigen, by contrast, has been regarded as a better indicator of poor prognosis and recurrence. The purpose of this study is to clarify whether CA19-9 is, in fact, a useful marker in the management of colorectal cancer patients by comparing it with carcinoembryonic antigen.

Methods

A retrospective investigation was done for a consecutive series of 155 patients with colorectal adenocarcinoma who underwent potentially curative surgery between 1995 and 1999. Excluded were patients with postoperative assays performed less than three times for either carcinoembryonic antigen or CA19-9 and those who had developed secondary cancers. Data from 118 patients were analyzed in terms of prediction of prognosis and detection of recurrences.

Results

The sensitivities of preoperative CA19-9 and carcinoembryonic antigen were 29.8 percent and 45.3 percent, respectively. In the univariate analysis of preoperative carcinoembryonic antigen and CA19-9 assays in 114 patients, high carcinoembryonic antigen level was significantly associated with poor prognosis (P = 0.0090) by log-rank test). We could not find a significant association between preoperative CA19-9 abnormality and survival (P = 0.12). Multivariate analysis of preoperative factors indicated significance in TNM stage (P = 0.0094) and tumor location (P = 0.036) but in neither carcinoembryonic antigen (P = 0.061) nor CA19-9 (P = 0.22). Among 40 patients with recurrences, postoperative elevations of tumor markers were seen in 19 cases for CA19-9 and in 37 for carcinoembryonic antigen throughout the follow-up periods. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were 0.48, 0.88, 0.68, and 0.77, respectively, for CA19-9, and 0.93, 0.88, 0.80, and 0.96, respectively, for carcinoembryonic antigen. In patients with recurrences, the initial postoperative elevation of tumor markers was seen earlier than the detection of recurrence in 68.4 percent of those with CA19-9 elevation and in 67.6 percent of those with carcinoembryonic antigen elevation. There was only one patient with recurrence who had CA19-9 elevation without carcinoembryonic antigen elevation, while 19 recurrent patients had carcinoembryonic antigen elevation without CA19-9 elevation. Multivariate analysis showed a significant risk of carcinoembryonic antigen elevation against recurrence with an odds ratio of 32.0 (P < 0.0001), in contrast to an insignificant association of CA19-9 elevation (P = 0.23).

Conclusion

We could not find clinical significance to support the use of CA19-9 to predict the prognosis and detect recurrence of colorectal cancer. Because of this, we do not recommend routine use of CA19-9 in staging and surveillance of colorectal cancer patients.

### New insights into the role of age and carcinoembryonic antigen in the prognosis of colorectal cancer [^66e620b5]. British Journal of Cancer (2008). Low credibility.

DISCUSSION

Checking prognostic factors evaluated in relation to overall survival for their significance to relative survival is a way of recognising and separating what of the patients' fate depends strictly on cancer and what depends on the large number of comorbid conditions that increasingly affect the elderly. Since the age of the population is increasing and, moreover, the incidence of colorectal cancer rises with age, it is useful to adjust the overall survival of these cancer patients according to the expected mortality from all causes of death. The datum used for this purpose is the expected mortality in the general population with exactly the same age, sex and length of observation as for the group of patients. Note that by this method, sex and age are considered prognostic factors already present in the general population, as they undoubtedly are, and can be considered prognostic factors of the disease under investigation only if the role usually exerted on the general population is significantly altered. The relative survival obtained in this way is a very good estimate of the specific survival, moreover, achieved without the well-known difficulty of defining the exact causes of death in retrospective series. This investigation was limited to patients who underwent local radical resection of a colorectal tumour and all the data analysed were collected before the start of adjuvant chemotherapy (or follow-up, if no therapy had to be administered).

Pooled Analysis for Diagnostic Sensitivity and Specificity

The pooled diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of CEA in colorectal cancer was 0.53 (95% CI 0.50–0.56) and 0.86 (95% CI 0.85–0.88), respectively (Table 3). For CA19-9, sensitivity was 0.47 (95% CI 0.44–0.51) and specificity was 0.92 (95% CI 0.91–0.94) and, for CA125, pooled diagnostic sensitivity was 0.20 (95% CI 0.15–0.26) and specificity was 0.99 (95% CI 0.98–1.00). Heterogeneity for diagnosis determined using the I 2 statistic, which represented the consistency, was 0.86 for CEA and 0.96 for CA19-9 and CA125. Similar results were found for esophagogastric cancer (Table 4).

### Comparison of carcinoembryonic antigen prognostic value in serum and tumour tissue of patients with colorectal cancer [^d3f35e89]. Colorectal Disease (2009). Low credibility.

In the current study of 173 CRC patients, there was no significant difference in the disease-free survival time between low and high S-CEA. The S-CEA is not an independent prognostic factor for CRC by multivariate analysis. Previous experiments have reported that an elevated preoperative serum CEA level is a predictor for poor survival after CRC resection, some even suggesting that serum CEA was an independent factor of CRC prognosis. By contrast, some studies demonstrated that serum CEA had significant prognostic value only in some special stages or the significance is not independent of staging system, which is similar to our results. The present study, along with some previous reports, had revealed no significant relationship between preoperative serum CEA and tumour tissue CEA concentrations. The reasons for these inconsistent results may be due to CEA production, release and metabolism. As we know, many factors may affect this course. Firstly, well-differentiated CRCs produce more CEA than poorly differentiated specimens. Similarly, S-CEA tends to be higher in patients with well-differentiated tumours compared with those poorly differentiated tumours. Thus, a lack of differentiation or poor differentiation may explain why some patients with advanced CRC do not have increased S-CEA values. Secondly, the liver is the primary site for the metabolism of CEA. Consequently, S-CEA can be increased from patients with impaired liver function such as certain nonmalignant liver diseases. Thirdly, some reports suggest that patients with tumours in the left side of the colon generally have a higher incidence of increased S-CEA than those with malignancies on the right side of the colon. Fourthly, Sugarbaker showed that bowel obstruction may give rise to S-CEA in patients with CRC and decompression alone can reduce serum CEA values. Fifthly, S-CEA values can be almost doubled by smoking. Finally, patients with aneuploid CRC have been shown to produce higher S-CEA than those with tumours with a near diploid pattern. All these findings make the S-CEA and T-CEA unparallel.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: ovarian cancer / fallopian tube cancer / primary peritoneal cancer, version 3.2024 [^f7eaf874]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2024). High credibility.

Ovarian cancer tumor markers and mucinous histology — elevations and diagnostic cutoffs are outlined as follows: "Elevated serum CEA is a marker associated with gastrointestinal (GI) primary cancers, but can also occur in patients with ovarian malignancies, particularly mucinous tumors". Because of this association, "some advocate for further GI imaging in patients with high serum CEA". A "ratio of serum CA-125 to CEA > 25 has been proposed for differentiating ovarian cancer from colorectal cancer", and "CA-125:CEA ratio has been incorporated into entry criteria in trials testing neoadjuvant therapies". For mucinous ovarian cancer, "it has been proposed that CEA may be useful for monitoring for recurrent disease". "CA19-9 is another marker that is elevated more often in mucinous tumors compared with other ovarian cancer types", and "serum CA19-9 may be useful for monitoring for recurrence, especially in patients with mucinous ovarian cancers, and in those with high CA19-9 levels prior to treatment".

### New insights into the role of age and carcinoembryonic antigen in the prognosis of colorectal cancer [^9d5a4985]. British Journal of Cancer (2008). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to verify through relative survival (an estimate of cancer-specific survival) the true prognostic factors of colorectal cancer. The study involved 506 patients who underwent locally radical resection. All the clinical, histological and laboratory parameters were prognostically analysed for both overall and relative survival. This latter was calculated from the expected survival of the general population with identical age, sex and calendar years of observation. Univariate and multivariate analyses were applied to the proportional hazards model. Liver metastases, age, lymph node involvement and depth of bowel wall involvement were independent prognosticators of both overall and relative survival, whereas carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) was predictive only of relative survival. Increasing age was unfavourably related to overall survival, but mildly protective with regard to relative survival. Three out of the five prognostic factors identified are the cornerstones of the current staging systems, and were confirmed as adequate by the analysis of relative survival. The results regarding age explain the conflicting findings so far obtained from studies considering overall survival only and advise against the adoption of absolute age limits in therapeutic protocols. Moreover, the prechemotherapy CEA level showed a high clinical value.

### Carcinoembryonic antigen is the preferred biomarker for in vivo colorectal cancer targeting [^c7eadf91]. British Journal of Cancer (2013). Low credibility.

Results

Expression of markers in normal colorectal tissue and tumours

We examined expression of CEA, TAG-72, FR α and EGFR in a cohort of 280 colorectal carcinomas and matched normal tissues. Clinical and pathological features of this cohort are shown in Table 1. Representative images of staining for each antigen in both normal and tumour tissues are shown in Figure 1. All four markers showed epithelial cell specific staining that was diffuse with some luminal accentuation. No staining for any marker was noted in blood cells within the sections, suggesting that expression in this compartment is negligible. The intra-class correlation coefficient was 0.89, demonstrating good agreement between scorers. Both the proportion of epithelial cells staining positively and the intensity of staining varied widely throughout the cohort in normal and tumour tissues (Figure 2). Strongly positive staining in normal tissues was relatively uncommon for all antigens, especially for FR α (negative in over 99% at the concentrations used). In the tumours, by contrast, strongly positive staining was prevalent for CEA and TAG-72, and was more common for FR α than in normal tissue although tumours were also mostly negative (61%). Epithelial growth factor receptor staining in tumours showed a similar range of scores to those in normal tissues. Carcinoembryonic antigen, TAG-72 and FR α, but not EGFR, were significantly more highly expressed in colorectal tumour tissues than in the normal tissues (P < 0.001; Table 2).

### Monitoring and predicting response to therapy with 18F-FDG PET in colorectal cancer: a systematic review [^822b73b1]. Journal of Nuclear Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Molecular imaging with (18)F-FDG PET has been proven useful in the management of colorectal cancer. (18)F-FDG PET plays a pivotal role in staging before surgical resection of recurrent colorectal cancer and metastases, in the localization of recurrence in patients with an unexplained rise in serum carcinoembryonic antigen levels, and in the assessment of residual masses after treatment. Currently, there is increasing interest in the role of (18)F-FDG PET beyond staging. The technique appears to have significant potential for the characterization of tumors and for the prediction of prognosis in the context of treatment stratification and early assessment of tumor response to therapy. This systematic review provides an overview of the literature on the value of (18)F-FDG PET for monitoring and predicting the response to therapy in colorectal cancer. The review covers chemotherapy response monitoring in advanced colorectal cancer, monitoring of the effects of local ablative therapies, and preoperative radiotherapy and multimodality treatment response evaluation in primary rectal cancer. Given the added value of (18)F-FDG PET for these indications, implementation in clinical practice and systematic inclusion in therapeutic trials to exploit the potential of (18)F-FDG PET are warranted.

### Carcinoembryonic antigen interacts with TGF-{ beta } receptor and inhibits TGF-{ beta } signaling in colorectal cancers [^eaa7c6a2]. Cancer Research (2010). Low credibility.

As a tumor marker for colorectal cancers, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) enhances the metastatic potential of cancer cells. CEA functions as an intercellular adhesion molecule and is upregulated in a wide variety of human cancers. However, the molecular mechanisms by which CEA mediates metastasis remain to be understood. Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) signaling regulates both tumor suppression and metastasis, and also contributes to the stimulation of CEA transcription and secretion in colorectal cancer cells. However, it remains unknown whether CEA, in turn, influences TGF-β functions and if a regulatory cross-talk exists between CEA and the TGF-β signaling pathway. Here, we report that CEA directly interacts with TGF-β receptor and inhibits TGF-β signaling. Targeting CEA with either CEA-specific antibody or siRNA rescues TGF-β response in colorectal cancer cell lines with elevated CEA, thereby restoring the inhibitory effects of TGF-β signaling on proliferation. CEA also enhances the survival of colorectal cancer cells in both local colonization and liver metastasis in animal study. Our study provides novel insights into the interaction between CEA and TGF-β signaling pathway and establishes a negative feedback loop in amplifying the progression of colon cancer cells to more invasive phenotypes. These findings offer new therapeutic opportunities to inhibit colorectal cancer cell proliferation by cotargeting CEA in promoting tumor-inhibitory action of the TGF-β pathway.
