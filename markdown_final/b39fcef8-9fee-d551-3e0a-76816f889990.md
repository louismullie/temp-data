## Question

Quelle investigation faire chez son enfant de deux mois ayant une hemi hypertrophie et une augmentation de l'alphafoetoprotéines à 773 µg par litre

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what investigations to perform for a 2-month-old infant with hemihypertrophy and an elevated alpha-fetoprotein of 773 µg/L. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the AFP unit and whether this value is truly abnormal for the infant's age. Then, I should verify the malignancy risks associated with lateralized overgrowth and the role of AFP in hepatoblastoma screening. Next, I will outline the immediate imaging and laboratory workup, including renal ultrasound and liver imaging. After that, I need to consider genetic testing strategies and the distinction between Beckwith-Wiedemann spectrum and idiopathic lateralized overgrowth. Finally, I will synthesize a surveillance plan and address key differentials and pitfalls, ensuring each step aligns with current guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the AFP value and its significance. Wait, let me verify the unit conversion: 773 µg/L equals 773 ng/mL, which is markedly elevated for a 2-month-old infant, since physiologic AFP declines rapidly after birth and should be near adult levels by about 6 months, so this is not a physiologic elevation and warrants urgent evaluation for hepatoblastoma and other embryonal tumors [^notfound].

> Next, I should review the malignancy risks tied to hemihypertrophy. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions: historically, isolated hemihypertrophy carried an approximate 5% risk of Wilms tumor and hepatoblastoma, prompting routine surveillance until age 7, but more recent ACMG guidance reframes this as lateralized overgrowth and emphasizes that with modern molecular evaluation, idiopathic cases may carry a lower risk, though consensus still supports baseline abdominal ultrasound and selective AFP surveillance in many infants with LO/hemihypertrophy [^6c245028] [^88265d41] [^5c4274c2].

> I will now examine the immediate imaging strategy. I need to ensure we image both kidneys and the liver promptly: abdominal ultrasound is first-line to assess renal asymmetry and screen for Wilms tumor, and to evaluate the liver for hepatoblastoma; if ultrasound is abnormal or AFP remains elevated, MRI of the liver is indicated to better characterize hepatic lesions, given MRI's superior sensitivity and specificity for pediatric liver tumors compared with ultrasound alone [^88265d41] [^b95eee21].

> Let me consider the laboratory workup. I should confirm that serial AFP measurements are obtained every 3 months until age 3, because AFP dynamics help detect hepatoblastoma early; importantly, AFP is not perfectly sensitive, so a normal AFP does not exclude tumor, and conversely, nonmalignant liver conditions can rarely elevate AFP, which is why imaging correlation is essential [^88265d41] [^b95eee21].

> Next, I should review genetic testing. Hold on, I should verify the approach: testing for Beckwith-Wiedemann spectrum should include methylation analysis of 11p15.5 and consideration of CDKN1C sequencing, ideally in blood and, if available, affected tissue, because mosaicism and somatic variants can be missed in blood alone; if negative, broader mosaic overgrowth panels or exome/genome with attention to mosaic calls may be considered, recognizing that many cases remain idiopathic despite thorough testing [^d9ca2095] [^78303085] [^88265d41].

> I need to ensure the surveillance plan is explicit and age-appropriate. Let me think about the timing: if kidneys are symmetric on baseline ultrasound and no molecular diagnosis is established, tumor risk is likely under 1% and ongoing screening may be deferred; if kidneys are asymmetric or if any molecular abnormality is found, continue abdominal ultrasound every 3 months until age 3 and then annually to age 7, with AFP every 3 months until age 3 and periodic clinical exams, aligning with ACMG and historical BWS/hemihypertrophy protocols [^88265d41] [^6c245028].

> But wait, what if the AFP elevation is not due to tumor? I should double-check differentials: physiologic neonatal AFP is high at birth and falls quickly, so a level of 773 ng/mL at 2 months is still abnormal; rare benign entities like hereditary persistence of AFP can cause chronically elevated AFP without disease, and certain hepatic vascular malformations or regenerative states can also raise AFP, so serial trending and imaging correlation are critical to avoid misclassification [^0c5ddfb3] [^b21168ab].

> I should confirm that the initial evaluation also screens for other overgrowth features. Let me reconsider the exam elements: look for macroglossia, ear creases/pits, neonatal hypoglycemia, organomegaly, and abdominal wall defects to support Beckwith-Wiedemann spectrum, because identifying BWS changes molecular testing selection and may influence tumor risk stratification and counseling [^d9ca2095].

> In summary, I need to ensure a coordinated, time-sensitive plan: urgently obtain abdominal ultrasound of kidneys and liver, repeat AFP now and then every 3 months until age 3, initiate BWS/11p15 methylation testing with consideration of affected tissue mosaicism, and escalate to liver MRI if ultrasound is abnormal or AFP remains elevated; tailor ongoing surveillance to kidney symmetry and molecular findings, and maintain a low threshold to image and trend given the elevated AFP and lateralized overgrowth in this 2-month-old infant [^88265d41] [^d9ca2095] [^b95eee21].

Chez un enfant de 2 mois avec hémihypertrophie et une AFP à 773 µg/L, il faut **urgemment évaluer le risque de tumeurs embryonnaires** (hépatoblastome et tumeur de Wilms) [^6c245028] [^88265d41]. Le plan d'investigation comprend:

- **Échographie abdominale urgente** (reins et foie) pour rechercher une tumeur de Wilms ou un hépatoblastome [^88265d41].
- **Dosage répété de l'AFP** tous les 3 mois jusqu'à 3 ans, car l'AFP est un marqueur du hépatoblastome [^88265d41].
- **Consultation en génétique** pour évaluer un syndrome de Beckwith-Wiedemann ou une autre cause génétique [^d9ca2095].
- **Surveillance clinique régulière** (examen physique tous les 6 mois jusqu'à 7 ans) [^88265d41].

Cette démarche permet une **détection précoce des tumeurs** et une prise en charge adaptée [^aef77606].

## Signification clinique de l'élévation de l'alpha-fœtoprotéine (AFP)

L'AFP est un marqueur tumoral produit par le foie fœtal et la vésicule vitelline. Chez le nourrisson, des niveaux élevés peuvent indiquer une **tumeur hépatique primitive** (hépatoblastome) ou d'autres tumeurs embryonnaires [^aef77606]. Des valeurs normales élevées sont attendues chez le nouveau-né, mais elles diminuent rapidement; à 2 mois, une AFP de 773 µg/L est **anormalement élevée** et justifie une évaluation approfondie [^notfound].

---

## Investigations recommandées

### Imagerie médicale

- **Échographie abdominale urgente**: évaluation des reins et du foie pour détecter une tumeur de Wilms ou un hépatoblastome [^88265d41].
- **IRM abdominale**: si l'échographie est anormale ou non concluante, pour une meilleure définition des lésions [^b95eee21].

---

### Tests biologiques

Des **dosages répétés de l'AFP** tous les 3 mois jusqu'à l'âge de 3 ans sont recommandés pour surveiller l'évolution et détecter une éventuelle tumeur hépatique [^88265d41]. Un **test génétique** — évaluation pour un syndrome de Beckwith-Wiedemann ou d'autres syndromes génétiques associés à l'hémihypertrophie — est également indiqué [^d9ca2095].

---

### Surveillance clinique

Un **examen physique régulier** tous les 6 mois jusqu'à l'âge de 7 ans permet de détecter précocement toute anomalie clinique [^88265d41].

This article aims to provide a structured and concise guide for the general paediatrician managing a child with hemihypertrophy. Hemihypertrophy is a relatively uncommon condition. The significance is that a proportion of those affected are at risk of developing malignancies in childhood. For these children regular surveillance is required. We have outlined how one might assess and investigate a child presenting with hemihypertrophy. We have also formulated a practicable surveillance strategy which is in line with the current Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health (RCPCH) guideline 'Wilms' tumour surveillance in at-risk children'.

### Congenital hemihypertrophy with hemihypertrichosis [^ecec08a6]. The Journal of Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

The rare condition in which one side of the body seems to grow faster than the other is called hemihypertrophy. This may be accepted as normal, but there are certain serious conditions that may be associated with this type of growth pattern. Congenital hypertrichosis is believed to be a genetic disorder that is inherited or occurs as a result of spontaneous mutation. The incidence of generalised congenital hypertrichosis is about one in a billion. A seven-month-old female case was brought to the hospital with growth and hairiness complaints, which were more apparent in the right side of the face, the right arm and the right leg. Physical examination showed more apparent hypertrophy and hypertrichosis, which covered the entire right side of the body beginning from the face and including the lower extremities and the genitalia. Hypertrichosis was more evident above the right scapula and on the right leg. The diameter of the right upper extremity and the right lower extremity were measured at 13 mm and 14 mm thicker than the left side, respectively. The infant did not have teeth yet and had totally normal nail growth. Skeletal structure, cardiovascular, respiratory, urogenital, central nervous system and eye examinations were all normal. Results of all laboratory analyses, including genetic examination, and those of the imaging techniques were found to be normal. We hereby present the rare co-presence of hemihypertrophy and hemihypertrichosis, for which we could not identify an etiological cause and which is the third such case in the literature.

### Α-fetoprotein assay on dried blood spot for hepatoblastoma screening in children with overgrowth-cancer predisposition syndromes [^cea55411]. Pediatric Research (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS) and hemihyperplasia (HH) are overgrowth conditions with predisposition to hepatoblastoma for which early diagnosis patients undergo cancer screening based on determination of the tumor marker α-fetoprotein (αFP). Repeated blood draws are a burden for patients with consequent compliance issues and poor adherence to surveillance protocol. We sought to analyze feasibility and reliability of αFP dosage using an analytical micromethod based on blood dried on filter paper (DBS).

Methods

Overall 143 coupled αFP determinations on plasma and DBS collected simultaneously were performed, of which 31 were in patients with hepatoblastoma predisposition syndromes and 112 were in controls. The plasma αFP dosage method was adapted to DBS adsorbed on paper matrix for newborn screening.

Results

There was strong correlation between plasmatic and DBS αFP (r² = 0.999, P < 0.001). Cohen's k coefficient for correlation was 0.96 for diagnostic cut-off of 10U/ml (P < 0.001), commonly employed in clinical practice. The measurements on plasma and DBS were highly overlapping and consistent.

Conclusion

The DBS method allowed to dose αFP reliably and consistently for the concentrations commonly employed in clinical settings for the screening of hepatoblastoma, opening new scenarios about conducting cancer screening in overgrowth syndromes.

### The following 3 cases were presented at the 2020 virtual PUOWG conferenceLate presentation of wilms tumor in a patient with hemihypertrophy after normal screening [^8f5b7053]. Urology (2021). Medium credibility.

An identifiable genetic malformation or predisposition syndrome is present in 18% of Wilms tumor cases. Given this, children with conditions associated with a greater than 1% risk of developing Wilms tumor are recommended to have regular surveillance imaging with renal ultrasound until age 7. Seven years is the recommended screening duration because 95% of cases will occur by this age. We present a case of a child with isolated hemihypertrophy, associated with 5% risk of Wilms tumor, who presented with a tumor after the recommended screening, at age 9, brining into question the age cutoffs currently used.

### Thyroid hemiagenesis: incidence, clinical significance, and genetic background [^795d8e15]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2017). Low credibility.

Context

Thyroid hemiagenesis (THA) constitutes a rare, congenital disorder that is characterized by an absence of one thyroid lobe. Because the pathogenesis and clinical significance of this malformation remain undefined, specific clinical recommendations are lacking, especially for asymptomatic cases.

Evidence Acquisition

The PubMed database was searched (years 1970 to 2017), and the following terms were used to retrieve the results: "thyroid hemiagenesis", "thyroid hemiaplasia", "one thyroid lobe agenesis", and "one thyroid lobe aplasia". Subsequently, reference sections of the retrieved articles were searched.

Evidence Synthesis

There is a noticeable susceptibility of subjects with THA to develop additional thyroid and nonthyroidal pathologies. In pathogenesis of concomitant thyroid pathologies, a chronic elevation in thyroid-stimulating hormone values may play an important role. Thus far, genetic studies failed to find a common genetic background of the anomaly, and the potential underlying cause was identified in a minority of the cases.

Conclusions

Patients with THA are prone to develop additional thyroid pathologies and theoretically might benefit from l-thyroxine treatment to lower the thyrotropin levels to those observed in the normal population. However, further research should be done to ascertain whether such intervention early in life would prevent development of associated thyroid conditions. At least, increased vigilance should be maintained to reveal all of the concomitant disorders as soon as possible during follow-up examinations. Application of high-throughput technologies enabling a genome-wide search for novel factors involved in thyroid embryogenesis might be the next step to expand the knowledge on THA pathogenesis.

### Report of hereditary persistence of α-fetoprotein in a Spanish family: molecular basis and clinical concerns [^0c5ddfb3]. Journal of Hepatology (2003). Low credibility.

The serum level of alpha-fetoprotein in normal adults is lower than 10 ng/ml. High levels of alpha-fetoprotein in adults are linked to cirrhosis, acute or chronic hepatitis, hepatocellular carcinomas and other pathologies, as well as to foetal malformation, and this protein is therefore used as a regular clinical marker for these diseases. We report a Spanish family in which very high levels of alpha-fetoprotein have been detected in nine members from the screening of a total of 17 relatives. These levels of alpha-fetoprotein are not accompanied by a causing pathology, are inherited as an autosomal dominant genetic trait, and are associated to a G→ A substitution at position -116 of the 5'-flanking region of the alpha-fetoprotein gene. This is an unusual benign trait of hereditary persistence of alpha-fetoprotein. This paper provides a detailed clinical report of the family including a study of the molecular basis of this trait. The desirability of a test to detect and/or rule out this benign trait in adults with abnormal levels of alpha-fetoprotein is considered.

The authors present the case of a child diagnosed as having Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome and Chiari I malformation. Hemihypertrophy is associated with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome and has been described in conjunction with Chiari I malformation. The authors hypothesize that the hemihypertrophy that may involve the skull base and Chiari I malformation found in their patient are not spurious findings but are pathologically related, perhaps by slight dysmorphologies of the posterior cranial fossa.

### Methylation analysis and diagnostics of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome in 1, 000 subjects [^78303085]. Clinical Epigenetics (2014). Low credibility.

As genetic testing becomes less expensive and more accessible, testing is frequently requested by non-specialist clinicians, and it becomes increasingly useful to have criteria for identifying those patients who are most likely to have a positive test. Traditionally, clinical diagnostic criteria are used to select patients for molecular investigations. However, in the case of BWS clinical diagnostic criteria might be satisfied but molecular testing might be negative and, conversely, a molecular abnormality might be detected in a patient who does not satisfy clinical diagnostic criteria – such as in isolated hemihypertrophy. Here, we have focused on identifying a set of clinical criteria that are most predictive of a positive 'BWS methylation assay'. Initially, we evaluated different sets of proposed clinical diagnostic criteria and, although some performed better than others, none was strikingly superior. We therefore used logistical regression analysis to identify those features most predictive of a positive 'BWS methylation assay' test and then developed a weighted clinical scoring system that was demonstrated to outperform previously reported sets of clinical diagnostic criteria. Hence, we propose that this new scoring system should be used to guide which individuals with suspected BWS should be selected for investigation with a 'BWS methylation assay' test. However, it should be noted that there are limitations to this scoring system. Firstly, less frequent, but potentially significant, clinical features such as embryonal tumours are not incorporated into the scoring system because there is insufficient data to support their inclusion, and so the scoring system would not be appropriate for patients presenting with a BWS-related tumour. Secondly, the scoring system is to predict a positive result for a 'BWS methylation assay' and not a positive result for all BWS-associated molecular abnormalities. Thus, in familial BWS, where CDKN1C mutations are the most frequent abnormality, a scoring system designed to predict an abnormal 'BWS methylation assay' would not be appropriate as a normal IC1/2 methylation profile and a positive family history of maternally inherited BWS would indicate a requirement for CDKN1C mutation analysis. Similarly, this is also indicated in sporadic cases with an abdominal wall defect (umbilical hernia or exomphalos) and no hemihypertrophy. Although our cohort was not comprehensively tested for CDKN1C mutations, 2.9% (17/584) of referrals with a normal 'BWS methylation assay' result were later found to have a CDKN1C mutation (mean score 4.1, range 0 to 7). Furthermore, the challenge that detection of low-level mosaicism brings to BWS diagnostics must be considered. Thus, given the increased risk of tumorigenesis in individuals with isolated hemihypertrophy, and the difficulty in identifying a molecular abnormality, such individuals may benefit from further sensitive testing.

### New frontiers in biomarkers for hepatocellular carcinoma [^b99a1ea4]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2006). Low credibility.

Hepatocellular carcinoma represents the fifth most frequent cancer in the world; it commonly occurs on cirrhotic liver. Prognosis and survival are still poor, mainly because of diagnosis at a late stage and/or recurrence of the disease. For this reason, surveillance strategies are widely used to screen for early occurrence of cancer in populations at risk. Alpha-foetoprotein is so far the only serological marker available, but its diagnostic accuracy is unsatisfactory because of low sensitivity despite reliable specificity. For this reason, new biomarkers for the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma are in strong demand by clinicians. In this review, we will focus on new biomarkers currently under investigation, but also on still newer, very promising biomarkers that seem to significantly improve diagnosis.

### Bilateral pheochromocytomas in a child who had hemihypertrophy and alteration in the VHL gene [^67aca764]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2013). Low credibility.

The association of hypertrophy with neoplasm is well-known. Pheochromocytoma is a rare neoplasm in children. Isolated hemihypertrophy and hemihypertrophy linked to other genetic disorders have rarely been associated with the development of pheochromocytoma, with only two cases reported to date. We report a novel case of a 4-year-old male with bilateral adrenal pheochromocytomas and lower extremity hemihypertrophy in the setting of von Hippel-Lindau syndrome.

### Coincidence of congenital pseudarthrosis of the tibia and hemihypertrophy in a patient with neurofibromatosis type 1 [^c71befc2]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The coexistence of hemihypertrophy with CPT in the same limb can change the plan of treating the patient; instead of achieving union with a shorter limb, our patient achieved union with a longer limb because of the coexistence of segmental hypertrophy of the affected limb.

The goals of treating patients with congenital pseudarthrosis of tibia are to resect the pathological segment of bone, solid fixation, and achieve bone union. Resecting pathological bone predisposes those patients to have leg length discrepancies during follow-up, which ends up with the patient requiring lengthening procedures in the future. The rate of ending up with a short limb after completing the treatment for CPT patients can reach 77%.

Hemihypertrophy of the limb is a pathological condition that can be generalized or localized to a single limb. The affected tissues, including muscles and bone, are involved in pathological overgrowth. The etiology of hemihypertrophy can be idiopathic or have a background of a syndrome. The prevalence of idiopathic hemihypertrophy is reported to be 1:86,000 births, but the literature lacks consensus on the rate of hemihypertrophy in patients with NF-1. Leg length discrepancy in hemihypertrophy patients is considered predictable and, therefore, can be managed anytime during the patient's growth.

### Hemihyperplasia-multiple lipomatosis syndrome: an underdiagnosed entity in children with asymmetric overgrowth [^a8c2e601]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Hemihyperplasia can be found as an isolated abnormality, or as a predominant associated feature of an asymmetric overgrowth syndrome. This report describes 2 patients with hemihyperplasia-multiple lipomatosis syndrome. The finding of hemihyperplasia prompts careful examination for associated lipomatous lesions. Close follow-up is required because progressive growth of lipomatous lesions can be encountered as well as recurrence after excision.

### Methylation analysis and diagnostics of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome in 1, 000 subjects [^04c3adb9]. Clinical Epigenetics (2014). Low credibility.

Results

Clinical features of patients referred for diagnostic testing

A total of 1,091 individuals (male:female = 1.06:1) were referred for diagnostic testing. The most frequent indications for referral were: macroglossia (52.3%), anterior abdominal wall defects (44.8%; exomphalos in 22.8%, umbilical hernia in 21.5%, and diastasis recti in 5.4%), hemihypertrophy (41.4%), pre- or postnatal macrosomia (38.7%), ear creases/pits (36.4%), neonatal hypoglycaemia (29.8%), facial naevus flammeus (FNF, 24.1%), organomegaly (17.0%), polyhydramnios (10.1%), maxillary hypoplasia (9.6%), congenital heart defects (8.3%), and embryonal tumours (3.1%). The median number of clinical features at referral was three (range 1 to 13). Of those with a single clinical indication (22.8% of total referrals), the most frequent was hemihypertrophy (present in 65.5% of those with a single feature). In those with two or more clinical indications for referral, the most frequent combinations of features were macroglossia and ear creases/pits (37.9%).

### Muscle hemihypertrophy syndrome withgene mutation associated with tourette syndrome [^e1425453]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The PIK3CA mutation-related overgrowth syndrome or spectrum (PROS) is a group of heterogeneous diseases characterized by a segmental hypertrophy linked to a post-zygotic gain of function mutation in the PIK3CA gene. The PIK3CA gene encodes PI3-kinase, an enzyme involved in the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway, one of the major pathways of cell growth.

Here we report the case of a girl with a muscular hemihypertrophy associated with a PIK3CA gene mutation and Tourette syndrome (TS), which we consider a non-random association.

### Follow-up and risk of tumors in overgrowth syndromes [^162e107b]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2005). Low credibility.

A striking feature of the overgrowth syndromes (OGS) is the risk of cancer. In some OGS (Beckwith-Wiedemann, Perlman, Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndromes and hemihypertrophy) tumors appeared mostly in the abdomen (more than 94% of tumors), are usually diagnosed before 10 years, and most of them are embryonal. Conversely, in other OGS, such as Sotos syndrome, the most frequent type is lympho-hematological tumors, about two-thirds are extra-abdominal and some of these tumors may appear after the second decade of life. Based on a previous literature review, a specific schedule protocol for tumor screening was suggested for many OGS. In this article we briefly review some aspects of the current knowledge of OGS and tumors, emphasizing the follow-up of these disorders.

### European Society of Endocrinology and endocrine society joint clinical guideline: diagnosis and therapy of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency [^40b3ce2c]. European Journal of Endocrinology (2024). High credibility.

Morning serum cortisol thresholds for recovery of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis: If confirmation of recovery is desired, we recommend morning serum cortisol as the first test and consider values as a continuum. As a guide, we suggest recovery if cortisol is > 300 nmol/L or 10 µg/dL and glucocorticoids can be stopped safely; we suggest continuing the physiologic dose and repeating morning cortisol when results are between 150 nmol/L or 5 µg/dL and 300 nmol/L or 10 µg/dL; and we suggest continuing the physiologic dose and repeating morning cortisol after a few months when results are < 150 nmol/L or 5 µg/dL.

### Diagnostic criteria and tumor screening for individuals with isolated hemihyperplasia [^6c245028]. Genetics in Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Isolated hemihyperplasia, formerly termed isolated hemihypertrophy, is a congenital overgrowth disorder associated with an increased risk for embryonal tumors, mainly Wilms tumor and hepatoblastoma. This practice guideline will set forth the diagnostic criteria and tumor screening recommendations for children with isolated hemihyperplasia, based on the best information available. There is clinical overlap between isolated hemihyperplasia with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome. The majority of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome patients have a molecular abnormality involving the imprinted cluster of genes at 11p15.5. In contrast, the preponderance of isolated hemihyperplasia patients studied have no identified etiology. Tumors have developed in isolated hemihyperplasia patients with and without molecular abnormalities. For this reason, molecular diagnostics are not helpful in identifying the subset of isolated hemihyperplasia patients with tumor risk and all isolated hemihyperplasia patients should undergo tumor screening.

### Confounding association of lower limb hypertrophy with retarded long bone growth in mosaic somatic neurofibromatosis 1 – A genetic review and femoral lengthening treatment [^27747a9c]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

This is a case report of a 15-year-old adolescent boy with NF1 with regional somatic mosaicism in the right half of his body. The novel clinical features are generalized hemihypertrophy of the right leg with progressive growth retardation of long bones of the same extremity, which results in a shorter leg. The patient successfully underwent limb lengthening procedure.

### Isolated lateralized overgrowth and the need for tumor screening: a clinical practice resource of the American College of Medical Genetics and genomics (ACMG) [^c62c8052]. Genetics in Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Definition and diagnosis of lateralized overgrowth (LO) — In 2017, the terms "isolated hemihypertrophy" and "isolated hemihyperplasia" were replaced by LO, defined as "significantly larger length and/or girth of aspect(s) of one side of the body compared with its contralateral side". The diagnosis of LO is usually based on physical examination, and although length or girth discrepancies of 10% or more are usually visually apparent, experienced examiners may detect more subtle asymmetries; given the variability and subjectivity, no objective parameters have been established and it is generally left to the examiner to decide if findings warrant further evaluation.

### Muscle hemihypertrophy syndrome withgene mutation associated with tourette syndrome [^08028d28]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Case report

This 9-year-old girl was referred for hypertrophy of the left upper limb and left hemithorax since birth (Fig 1). She was born as the first child from healthy and non-consanguineous parents. Pregnancy was marked by intrauterine growth retardation. Birth weight was 2520 g and birth length was 46 cm. Hemihypertrophy of the left arm and hand was noted immediately after birth. The hypertrophy was more pronounced on the thenar eminence, with an enlarged palm and abnormal palmar folds (Fig 2). There was no functional impact. There were no other pertinent exam findings. Whole-body magnetic resonance imaging showed isolated muscle hypertrophy over the left upper limb. The injected magnetic resonance imaging of the brain did not reveal abnormality.

Fig 2
Photo of the hypertrophy of the left upper limb and left hemithorax.

The molecular genetic analysis on a skin biopsy of the affected member showed a post-zygotic heterozygous missense variation c.1633G > A, which predicts p. Glu545Lys in PIK3CA. Quantitative PCR for the PIK3CA mutation c.1633G > A determined a fraction of 15% of mutant DNA in the affected skin tissue.

No progression of the muscular hypertrophy was noted. At 10 years of age, the patient developed daily verbal tics (screams, sounds, isolated words, and echolalia) and motor tics (upper limb spasms), associated with significant anxiety and difficulty in falling asleep. The diagnosis of TS was assessed and aripiprazole was prescribed with clinical monitoring.

### Bilateral adrenal cysts and ectopic pancreatic tissue in Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome: is a conservative approach acceptable? [^3014dd2d]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2004). Low credibility.

Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome is a common overgrowth syndrome associated with an increased risk of neoplasias which might be explained by the nature and localization of the genetic defect. While malignant tumors are often associated with hemihypertrophy, benign tumors are also found. We report a patient with the typical features of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome with two histologically different abdominal tumors, bilateral cystic adrenals and ectopic pancreatic tissue present at birth. In both tumors no malignancy could be detected. Ectopic pancreatic tissue is rarely seen and has been described in Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome only once. After extirpation of the ectopic pancreatic tissue the cystic adrenals were left in situ since macroscopically no normal adrenal tissue could be identified and separated. Regular ultrasound examinations revealed complete resolution of the cystic adrenals within 24 months. Thus it seems that a conservative approach in selected tumors associated with the Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome might be acceptable.

3.2. Monitoring treatment in primary CH

We recommend measurement of serum fT4 and TSH concentrations before or at least 4 hours after the last (daily) LT4 administration (1/++0).
We recommend evaluation of fT4 and TSH according to age-specific reference intervals (1/++0).
The first treatment goal in neonates with primary CH is to rapidly increase the circulating amount of TH, reflected by normalization of serum TSH; therafter, TSH should be kept within the reference interval.
If TSH is in the age-specific reference interval, fT4 concentrations above the upper limit of the reference interval can be accepted and recommend maintaining the same LT4 dose (1/++0).
Any reduction of the LT4 dose should not be based on a single higher than normal fT4 concentration, unless TSH is suppressed (i.e. below the lower limit of the reference interval) or there are signs of overtreatment (e.g. jitteriness or tachycardia) (1/++0).
The first clinical and biochemical follow-up evaluation should take place 1 to 2 weeks after the start of LT4 treatment (1 week at the latest in case of a starting dose of 50 μg per day or an even higher dose) (1/+00).
Subsequent (clinical and biochemical) evaluation should take place every 2 weeks until complete normalization of serum TSH is achieved; therafter, the evaluation frequency can be lowered to once every 1 to 3 months until the age of 12 months (1/+00).
Between the ages of 12 months and 3 years, the evaluation frequency can be lowered to every 2 to 4 months; thereafter, evaluations should be carried out every 3 to 6 months until growth is completed (1/+00).
If abnormal fT4 or TSH values are found, or if compliance is questioned, the evaluation frequency should be increased (2/+00).
After a change of LT4 dose or formulation, an extra evaluation should be carried out after 4 to 6 weeks (2/+00).
We recommend physicians to avoid long-term under- or overtreatment during childhood (1/++0).
In contrast to adults, in neonates, infants, and children, LT4 can be administered together with food (but with avoidance of soy protein and vegetable fiber); more important, LT4 should be administered at the same time every day, also in relation to food intake; while this approach can improve compliance, it ensures as constant as possible LT4 absorption and, with that, as good as possible LT4 dose titration (2/+00).
In case of an unexpected need for LT4 dose increase, reduced absorption, or increased metabolization of thyroxine (T4) by other disease (e.g. gastrointestinal), food or medication should be considered (2/+00); incompliance may be the most frequent cause, especially in teenagers and adolescents.

### Coincidence of congenital pseudarthrosis of the tibia and hemihypertrophy in a patient with neurofibromatosis type 1 [^a535dad1]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF-1) leads to cutaneous, neurological, and musculoskeletal manifestations. Congenital pseudarthrosis of the tibia treatment is considered aggressive in achieving bone union. Most of those patients get a short limb at the end of treatment because of pathological bone resection and malalignment. One of the manifestations that can appear in patients is localized hemihypertrophy of the limb. In our case, we present the first time a coexistence of congenital pseudarthrosis of the tibia and hemihypertrophy in the same leg was reported.

### The significance of the F variant of α-1-antitrypsin and unique case report of a PiFF homozygote [^b4e71dc0]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency (A1ATD) is a recognised genetic condition that predisposes to the development of early onset basal panacinar emphysema. The pathophysiology is thought to reflect a critically low or absent level of alpha-1-antitrypsin (A1AT) which reduces the ability of the lung to protect itself from neutrophil serine proteinases (NSPs) such as neutrophil elastase (NE) and proteinase 3 (PR3). The ability of A1AT to protect tissues is both dependent on its concentration and also the speed with which it traps and inactivates these enzymes, its association rate constant (K ass). The third NSP inhibited by A1AT, cathepsin G, does not produce emphysema-like lesions in animal models, and has not been included in this study.

The F variant of A1AT was first described in 1965 and results from a single amino acid substitution of arginine at residue 223 by cysteine. It has been reported to have a low K ass for NE, and has thus been implicated as a susceptibility factor for emphysema in its own right despite normal serum and hence lung levels. The F variant is relatively uncommon (reported to have an allelic frequency of approximately 0.002 in the Caucasian population) making clinical and epidemiological studies impractical. Even cases of heterozygotes with the Z or other deficiency variants which have both low A1AT levels and reduced K ass for NE are infrequent, although such patients are often considered for augmentation therapy.

We report a unique case of a patient who is homozygous for the F variant that permitted us to measure the K ass for NE and PR3 with confidence and also review the clinical features both of this patient and of those heterozygous with the Z variant. These data provide insight into whether the F variant represents a risk factor for the development of emphysema, either alone or in combination with the Z variant.

### Diagnostic and mechanistic implications of serum free light chains, albumin and α-fetoprotein in hepatocellular carcinoma [^8584a7b9]. British Journal of Cancer (2014). Low credibility.

Early diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is widely considered to be the key to effective therapy. Radical, potentially curative treatments, such as surgical resection, radiofrequency ablation and orthotopic liver transplantation are only applicable to that minority of patients who present with, or who are detected by screening to have, smaller tumours, typically < 5 cm in diameter. This observation has led to routine screening/surveillance of patients at high risk of HCC, namely those with advanced chronic liver disease and certain carriers of the hepatitis B or C viruses (HBV, HCV). Both in the screening situation and the clinical situation where it is required to determine if HCC has developed in a patient with symptoms, an imaging procedure, usually ultrasound, followed by a CT or MRI are the primary diagnostic modalities supplemented where necessary with histological confirmation by biopsy. Characteristic imaging features such as arterial enhancement and portal phase 'washout' have been recognised to be highly sensitive and specific features for the diagnosis of HCC. Nonetheless, such an approach is expensive and ultrasound examination is time-consuming and highly operator-dependent so, a simple serological diagnostic test would be invaluable. Estimation of serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) has been widely used in this respect and indeed it is well recognised to be highly specific and useful in the clinical setting when levels are elevated above a particular threshold typically set between 200 and 500 ng mL⁻¹. However, the role of AFP in the screening setting remains controversial, some supporting its utility and others, because of its low sensitivity in the early stages of the disease, have suggested that AFP has no role in the screening setting.

### Hepatoblastoma in a mosaic trisomy 18 child with hemihypertrophy [^9696f0d3]. BMJ Case Reports (2016). Medium credibility.

To date, there are 12 reported cases of hepatoblastoma in trisomy 18 patients, three of whom had a mosaic chromosome pattern. We report on an 18-month-old child who had hemihypertrophy and developmental delay, was found to have hepatoblastoma on surveillance ultrasound scan, and was subsequently diagnosed with mosaic trisomy 18 on array comparative genomic hybridisation from a peripheral blood sample and molecular cytogenetic analysis of the tumour specimen. Although hemihypertrophy has been associated with mosaic trisomies, there are only a couple of published case reports of hemihypertrophy or asymmetry in mosaic trisomy 18 patients and none in the reported cases of hepatoblastoma in a mosaic trisomy 18 setting. We have reviewed the published case reports of hepatoblastoma in trisomy 18 patients and found that they seem to tolerate the intensive treatment very well if there are no significant comorbidities.

### Extending the spectrum of AKT1 mosaicism: not just the Proteus syndrome [^d73a43de]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

, A 5‐year‐old girl was referred to us for evaluation of a pigmented birthmark, unchanged since birth, on her right cheek. There was no other previous medical history of note and no family history of relevant problems. Cutaneous examination revealed a pigmented keratinocytic epidermal naevus following fine Blaschko lines on the right cheek and neck (Fig. 1), and a solitary, 1‐cm café‐au‐lait macule on the lower leg. Subtle hemihypertrophy of the right cheek was noted, including the tragus of the ear, which had appeared to progress over time. In conjunction, she was noted to have right‐sided hemihypertrophy of the tongue with intraoral pigmentation of the mucosal surfaces, linear naevoid‐looking change on the right side of the tongue and right‐sided misalignment of the teeth. Her parents also gave a history of frequent malodorous right ear discharge. The patient was referred to otorhinolaryngology, who diagnosed a severe right‐sided conductive hearing loss. The remainder of her physical examination was unremarkable. Magnetic resonance imaging confirmed soft tissue hemihypertrophy of the cheek, with extensive soft tissue overgrowth within the right external auditory canal and middle‐ear cleft, and a sclerotic bony spur in the posterior inferior aspect of the external auditory canal (Fig. 1 g).

### EMQN best practice guidelines for the molecular genetic testing and reporting of chromosome 11p15 imprinting disorders: silver-russell and Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome [^d9ca2095]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2016). Low credibility.

Beckwith–Wiedemann syndrome

Beckwith–Wiedemann syndrome (BWS; OMIM130650) was initially called EMG syndrome from its three main features exomphalos/umbilical hernia, macroglossia and (neonatal) gigantism. Additional signs include neonatal hypoglycemia, hemihypertrophy, organomegaly (essentially kidney, liver, spleen, pancreas), earlobe creases, polyhydramnios, hemangioma and cardiomyopathy. In 5–7% of children, embryonal tumors (most commonly Wilm's tumor (WT)) are diagnosed (for a review see Brioude et al). The clinical diagnosis of BWS is often difficult because of its variable presentation and overlap with other overgrowth syndromes (for a review see Shuman et al), and hence several scoring systems have been suggested, (reviewed by Ibrahim et al). Robust genotype/epigenotype–phenotype correlations have been established, (Table 1): hemihypertrophy is strongly associated with upd(11)pat, exomphalos with H19/IGF2: IG-DMR hypermethylation and CDKN1C mutations, and, most importantly, the risk for WT is predominant in H19/IGF2: IG-DMR hypermethylation and upd(11)pat. By contrast, other embryonal tumors such as hepatoblastoma, neuroblastoma and adrenal tumors are observed in patients with KCNQ1OT1 :TSS-DMR or upd(11)pat, although at a much lower incidence. In patients with a mosaic paternal uniparental diploidy (also named 'genome-wide UPD'), further tumors can occur, with a later age of onset than in case of the other molecular subtypes. Hence, the determination of the molecular subtype is important for an individual prognosis and management. Nevertheless, phenotypic transitions are fluid, ranging from some features that include 'incomplete BWS' to the full clinical picture. Thus, molecular testing for BWS is also suggested in case of isolated hemihypertrophy as molecular changes in 11p15.5 have also been identified in patients with isolated body asymmetry. It should furthermore be considered in bilateral WT, familial WT cases and WT patients with at least one feature of BWS.

### Differences in dental and bone maturation in regions with or without hemihypertrophy in two patients with russell-silver syndrome [^e835f4f8]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2005). Low credibility.

Hemihypertrophy (hemihyperplasia) is defined as asymmetric body overgrowth of one or more body parts. Hemihypertrophy can be isolated or be part of well-defined syndromes, such as Russell-Silver syndrome (RSS). RSS is characterized by severe intrauterine growth retardation, postnatal short stature, asymmetry of the face, body, and limbs, short and incurved fifth fingers, broad forehead, pointed small triangular shaped face, girdle nose, normal psychomotor development, variations in the pattern of sexual development, and dental and oral abnormalities. The aim of this study was to determine whether or not there was any difference in the maturity of bone in left and right hand-wrist radiographs and dental development in the right and left jaws of two patients with RSS. In addition, the clinical features of the syndrome are discussed.

The hallmarks of thalassemias are ineffective erythropoiesis and peripheral hemolysis leading to a cascade of events responsible for several clinical complications. This pathophysiologic mechanism can be partially controlled by blood transfusions or by correction of the severity of ineffective erythropoiesis. Thalassemias include a spectrum of phenotypes. Two main groups can be clinically distinguished: transfusion-dependent (TDT) and non-transfusion-dependent (NTDT) thalassemia. Both conditions are characterized by several clinical complications along life; some are shared, whereas some have higher prevalence in one group over the other. The authors present the most common clinical complications in TDT and NTDT and their management.

Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS) is a complex overgrowth disorder usually recognized at birth. Children diagnosed with BWS, particularly those with hemihypertrophy, experience an increased risk of developing benign and malignant tumors. This case report presents a 12-year-old girl with BWS and hemihypertrophy who rapidly developed enlarging, asymmetric tumors of bilateral breasts. Few cases of patients with BWS and benign breast tumors exist in the literature. The differential diagnosis of breast tumors in the adolescent female is described. The treatment plan and reconstruction options particular to the developing young female are also discussed.

### Alpha-foetoprotein in umbilical cord in relation to severe pre-eclampsia, birth weight and future breast cancer risk [^8180862f]. British Journal of Cancer (2002). Low credibility.

DISCUSSION

Severe pre-eclampsia is characterised by abnormally shallow decidual invasion by the trophoblast, placental hypoxia, and reduced uteroplacental blood flow. We found that umbilical cord plasma AFP was substantially higher in severe pre-eclampsia compared to controls, whereas cord plasma oestradiol did not differ between the groups. Neither AFP nor oestradiol varied systematically with birth weight, but at each level of birth weight, AFP was consistently and significantly higher in severe pre-eclampsia than in controls.

To our knowledge, no previous study has used umbilical measurements of AFP and oestradiol to examine the association between pre-eclampsia and birth weight. Our study was performed within a population of nearly 13 000 consecutive births for whom umbilical cord plasma was collected. The large number of pregnancies and a strict clinical definition of pre-eclampsia allowed us to reliably distinguish between mild and severe disease. We have also benefited from the results of a longitudinal study of Scandinavian pregnancies. By using repeated ultrasonographic scans, the objective of that study was to establish standards for foetal growth. Expected birth weights were derived from these standards, and dividing observed birth weight by the expected yielded standardised estimates for birth weight adjusted for gestational age at birth and offspring sex.

The results in the control population (Table 2) were in line with previous research in that lower birth weight was related to primiparity, maternal smoking, and to the newborn being of the female sex. This supports the validity of the novel results of our investigation. We found substantially higher cord levels of AFP in boys than girls, but no sex difference for oestradiol. Moreover, we found that cord levels of oestradiol were inversely related to maternal age and parity. This has been demonstrated previously in maternal blood, and our results show a similar relation for oestradiol measured in cord blood.

In uncomplicated pregnancies, α-foetoprotein reaches its maximum at the beginning of the third trimester, and drops thereafter towards term. Cases of severe pre-eclampsia typically require that births will be therapeutically induced up to several weeks before term. Thus, collection of cord blood may coincide with a period in gestation when AFP levels would normally be higher than at term. Our results confirm that the association between severe pre-eclampsia and AFP was confounded by differences in gestational age. By taking these differences into account, the association was substantially attenuated, but remained statistically significant.

### Coincidence of congenital pseudarthrosis of the tibia and hemihypertrophy in a patient with neurofibromatosis type 1 [^8b400a2f]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF-1) was found to be one of the most prevalent autosomal dominant disorders that can be present in one among 3000 to 4000 of the population.NF-1 is a neurocutaneous disorder that varies in presentation from cutaneous, ocular, neoplastic, and musculoskeletal involvement. Patients can present for the first time with musculoskeletal involvement, including scoliosis, congenital pseudarthrosis of the tibia (CPT), or bowing of the forearm.CPT is considered a rare disease where it presents in one among 250,000 newborns. Almost 75% of those patients are diagnosed with NF1. Hemihypertrophy of the limb is a rare entity, with an overall prevalence of 10 births among 860,000. Localized hemihypertrophy of the limb is described as one of the manifestations of NF-1 patients with no reported consensus. Coexistent localized hemihypertrophy of the limb and CPT have never been reported. In this case, we report a 5-year-old girl who presented with a CPT with localized hemihypertrophy of the same limb, which presented with the affected leg longer than the normal side.

### Alpha-foetoprotein in umbilical cord in relation to severe pre-eclampsia, birth weight and future breast cancer risk [^fb127f5e]. British Journal of Cancer (2002). Low credibility.

Recent studies have found that women who were born after pre-eclamptic pregnancies have a reduced risk of breast cancer in adult life. Several studies have also suggested that low birth weight may be associated with reduced breast cancer risk. Since severe pre-eclampsia clearly reduces birth weight, one could speculate that the risk reduction linked to pre-eclampsia is mediated by restricted foetal growth. However, we found higher cord levels of AFP in the severe pre-eclampsia group than in controls, even after adjustment for birth weight and length of gestation. This finding may reinforce recent experimental evidence that AFP may be a factor with breast cancer inhibiting potential. In adulthood, two studies have recently related maternal blood levels of AFP during the second or third trimester among pregnant women to these women's subsequent risk of breast cancer. Both studies found that high pregnancy levels of AFP were associated with lower maternal breast cancer risk, and the authors attributed their findings to an anti-oestrogenic effect of AFP. Our findings may be important because they indicate that elevated AFP levels are associated with reduced breast cancer risk, not only among the pregnant women, but also among their female offspring.

Conclusion

The treatment of CPT is evolving and can lead to a short limb at the end of the treatment. Localized overgrowth of the limb is a reported manifestation of NF-1. The coexistence of CPT and localized hemihypertrophy in the same limb can change the management options for LLD in patients with CPT. The options can include permanent epiphysiodesis of the distal femur and proximal tibia on the CPT side or lengthening of the contralateral side.

Hereditary hemochromatosis — hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) risk and surveillance in cirrhosis are highlighted by substantial risk and defined intervals: in cirrhosis, HCC "accounts for as much as 45% of deaths in this population", with "the relative risk of tumor formation in HH… between 20 and 200" and "a SF level above 2000 ng/mL indicates particularly high risk". The "10-year incidence of HCC in patients with cirrhosis secondary HH is approximately 6%–10%". For surveillance, recommendations specify "ultrasound with or without alpha-fetoprotein levels performed every 6 months", and surveillance "should continue after iron removal is completed". Outside cirrhosis, "There are no data addressing the efficacy of HCC screening in patients with HH without cirrhosis" and "it is unknown whether patients with HH with stage 3 fibrosis are at increased risk of HCC".

Hepatocellular carcinoma — diagnostic imaging and AFP-based follow-up: For a definitely benign observed lesion, patients should return to a screening program with US and AFP in 6 months; if a diagnostic imaging test is suspected to be a false negative, a different imaging method with or without AFP may be considered, and if the observation is inconclusive multidisciplinary discussion and individualized workup may be pursued. Since serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) may be elevated in nonmalignant conditions or be within normal limits in up to 30% of patients with HCC, the panel considers an imaging finding of classic enhancement to be more definitive in the diagnostic setting compared to AFP alone. Additional imaging studies (CT or MRI) are recommended for patients with a rising serum AFP level in the absence of a liver mass, and if no liver mass is detected after an elevated AFP the patient should be followed with AFP testing and liver imaging.

### Presence of vascular anomalies with congenital hemihypertrophy and wilms tumor: an evidence-based evaluation [^a7ae2a87]. Pediatric Dermatology (2003). Low credibility.

Congenital hemihypertrophy is an uncommon condition of unknown etiology characterized by unilateral overgrowth of part or all of one side of the body. Hemihypertrophy is known to be associated with certain childhood tumors, most notably Wilms tumor (or nephroblastoma), and for this reason infants with hemihypertrophy are often followed with serial abdominal ultrasounds. Klippel-Trénaunay syndrome (KTS) is the triad of port-wine stain, venous varicosities, and soft tissue and/or bony hypertrophy. Children with KTS typically have localized rather than generalized hemihypertrophy, but occasionally the hypertrophy is more extensive than the vascular anomaly itself. Information is lacking about whether hemihypertrophy in this setting can also be a risk factor for Wilms tumor. We systematically reviewed the medical literature to determine whether well-documented cases of Wilms tumor in the setting of both hemihypertrophy and vascular anomalies have been described, and if found, whether the association was sufficiently frequent that routine screening for Wilms tumor in this setting should be recommended. A review of case reports and case series in the pediatric population was undertaken using specific inclusion and exclusion criteria. We found 4 of 58 subjects with hemihypertrophy and Wilms tumor had a reported vascular anomaly, but in only one case was a clear-cut diagnosis of KTS confirmed. The relationship of the other three vascular anomalies reported was of uncertain significance. In conclusion, our review suggests that the risk of Wilms tumor in the setting of localized soft-tissue hypertrophy in conjunction with a vascular malformation is quite low. More extensive hemihypertrophy extending to body sites remote from the vascular malformation itself could have a higher risk of Wilms tumor, although the magnitude of this risk is uncertain. Our findings suggest that routine serial abdominal ultrasounds in patients with vascular malformations in association with localized soft-tissue hypertrophy are unwarranted.

### Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome and primary lymphedema of the lower extremity [^de6e46f1]. Pediatric Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome is the most common genetic overgrowth syndrome. Patients with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome may have hemihypertrophy, but their lymphatic vasculature is intact. We present a child with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome and lower extremity enlargement thought to be due to hemihypertrophy that was instead diagnosed with primary lymphedema. There are many causes of leg overgrowth in the pediatric population and misdiagnosis is common. While extremity enlargement secondary to hemihypertrophy may occur in 15% of patients with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, progression and pitting edema only occur in primary lymphedema. This report highlights the importance of ensuring an accurate diagnosis so that patients are managed appropriately.

### Alpha-foetoprotein in umbilical cord in relation to severe pre-eclampsia, birth weight and future breast cancer risk [^d4fc20c4]. British Journal of Cancer (2002). Low credibility.

RESULTS

Table 1

Table 1
Characteristics of pregnancies (mean and standard deviation and percentages) with severe pre-eclampsia and control pregnancies

shows that in severe pre-eclampsia, mean maternal age was 26.2 vs 28.2 years among controls, whereas mean length of gestation was 251 and 280 days. In the pre-eclampsia group, 71% were primipara against 36.4% among controls. Infant birth weight was substantially lower after severe pre-eclampsia (mean: 2527 vs 3565 grams), as was infant length (mean: 45.2 vs 49.9 cm).

In Table 2

Maternal age, parity, pre-pregnancy weight, smoking in pregnancy, and offspring sex, related to median cord plasma levels of α-foeto protein (AFP), oestradiol, amd mean birth weight of the offspring in 610 pregnancies not complicated by pre-eclampsia, we describe the control population according to categories of maternal factors and sex of the infant. We found higher oestradiol (P < 0.03) in umbilical cord plasma in younger women, but no difference in AFP by maternal age. In primipara, cord plasma oestradiol was higher than in multiparae (P < 0.001), and there was a consistent reduction in cord plasma oestradiol (P for trend < 0.001) with increasing parity (Figure 1

Figure 1
Oestradiol in umbilical cord plasma according to maternal parity.). For AFP, we found no association with parity. There were no associations between pre-pregnancy weight and cord levels of oestradiol or AFP, and oestradiol and AFP did not significantly differ between smokers and non-smokers. Offspring birth weight was higher among multiparae than among primipara, it was positively associated with maternal pre-pregnancy weight, and birth weight was 188 g lower (P < 0.001) if the mother reported smoking at the beginning of pregnancy. Birth weight was 106 g higher (P = 0.01) in boys than girls. Oestradiol did not significantly differ by sex of the newborn, but AFP was higher in boys than in girls (P < 0.02).

### Isolated lateralized overgrowth and the need for tumor screening: a clinical practice resource of the American College of Medical Genetics and genomics (ACMG) [^5c4274c2]. Genetics in Medicine (2025). High credibility.

ACMG practice resource — isolated lateralized overgrowth (ILO) introduction summarizes that overgrowth can be generalized or localized as "lateralized overgrowth" (LO), with individuals having isolated LO considered idiopathic isolated lateralized overgrowth when no molecular cause is found; prior terms "isolated hemihypertrophy" or "isolated hemihyperplasia" are now considered obsolete. The document notes that evaluation for mosaic or somatic variants in affected tissue has historically not been part of testing for LO and remains underutilized, making it likely that some individuals with ILO have a missed molecular diagnosis; past test sensitivity likely inflated cancer risk estimates for "isolated hemihyperplasia". Historical ACMG guidance stated that all children with isolated hemihypertrophy/hemihyperplasia be screened for renal and hepatic malignancies until age 7, by which time > 95% of tumors would have occurred, based on an assumed 5% approximate lifetime risk of Wilms tumor and/or hepatoblastoma. This practice resource reevaluates the 2009 recommendations and addresses delineating a specific definition of ILO, a diagnostic strategy, the role of mosaicism and somatic variants, and providing recommendations for tumor screening in idiopathic ILO.

### Why does my patient have thrombocytosis? [^b519ddbb]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Thrombocytosis is a common clinical problem frequently encountered during routine evaluation. The diagnostic workup entails a step-by-step approach, which allows for an accurate assessment of the underlying cause. A thorough clinical history and physical examination may help differentiate thrombocytosis secondary to a reactive process versus an underlying clonal proliferation process. Once essential thrombocytosis is evident, relevant laboratory evaluation for an ongoing myeloproliferative disorder is paramount. Various treatment modalities have been proven to be beneficial. With further scientific investigation underway, molecular therapies may soon be cornerstones of therapy in essential thrombocytosis.

### European society for paediatric endocrinology consensus guidelines on screening, diagnosis, and management of congenital hypothyroidism [^7c53bb98]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2014). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Further research is required to improve our understanding of the pathophysiology and management of this heterogenous disorder.

Thyroid hormones play a crucial role in early neurodevelopment so that untreated severe CH results in neurological and psychiatric deficits, including intellectual disability, spasticity, and disturbances of gait and co-ordination. CH is one of the most common preventable causes of mental retardation. Screening programs, which have been in operation over the last 30 years in most industrialized countries, have led to the successful early detection and treatment of infants with CH and have eliminated the severe neurodevelopmental deficits resulting from late diagnosis. Studies on cognitive function in patients with CH treated soon after birth have shown that normal development can be achieved in most patients, although some may have subtle neurocognitive deficits.

Estimates of the prevalence of CH vary according to the method of ascertainment: about 1 in 2000 to 3000 live births in countries with neonatal screening vs about 1 in 6700 live births before the screening era. Recent reports have indicated that the incidence of primary CH may be increasing in some countries, particularly for cases with a normally located (eutopic) thyroid gland and milder dysfunction. The reasons for this remain unclear but may relate to changes in screening thresholds.

The results from neonatal screening programs have also helped to identify a broad spectrum of thyroid dysfunctions with different underlying etiologies. CH can be classified according to site: primary (thyroid) or secondary/central (pituitary and/or hypothalamic); to severity: FT4 levels within the normal range for age (compensated) or subnormal (decompensated); and to age of onset. The most common form of CH is primary hypothyroidism, with high TSH levels reflecting various types of abnormal thyroid gland development or dyshormonogenesis. Secondary hypothyroidism is much less frequent, either with isolated TSH deficiency due to mutations inactivating the TSH β-subunit, the TRH receptor, or IGSF1 (ImmunoGlobulin SuperFamily member 1), or more commonly with TSH deficiency associated with other pituitary hormone deficiencies.

Impaired thyroid hormone production may also be temporary or permanent, the latter requiring lifelong treatment, and thyroid dysfunction may change in a given individual with growth and development stages. Transient primary CH can be defined as an increase in TSH levels during the neonatal period, with normal TFT results obtained off treatment at a later stage. The purely descriptive term "hyperthyrotropinemia" refers to a form of compensated CH in which there is a mild increase in TSH concentration (eg, 6–20 mU/L) with normal thyroid hormone concentrations. It may also be transient or permanent.

### Abdominal ultrasound and α-foetoprotein for the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma in adults with chronic liver disease [^88094258]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) occurs mostly in people with chronic liver disease and ranks sixth in terms of global instances of cancer, and fourth in terms of cancer deaths for men. Despite that abdominal ultrasound (US) is used as an initial test to exclude the presence of focal liver lesions and serum alpha-foetoprotein (AFP) measurement may raise suspicion of HCC occurrence, further testing to confirm diagnosis as well as staging of HCC is required. Current guidelines recommend surveillance programme using US, with or without AFP, to detect HCC in high-risk populations despite the lack of clear benefits on overall survival. Assessing the diagnostic accuracy of US and AFP may clarify whether the absence of benefit in surveillance programmes could be related to under-diagnosis. Therefore, assessment of the accuracy of these two tests for diagnosing HCC in people with chronic liver disease, not included in surveillance programmes, is needed.

Objectives

Primary: the diagnostic accuracy of US and AFP, alone or in combination, for the diagnosis of HCC of any size and at any stage in adults with chronic liver disease, either in a surveillance programme or in a clinical setting. Secondary: to assess the diagnostic accuracy of abdominal US and AFP, alone or in combination, for the diagnosis of resectable HCC; to compare the diagnostic accuracy of the individual tests versus the combination of both tests; to investigate sources of heterogeneity in the results.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register, the Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Diagnostic-Test-Accuracy Studies Register, Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, Science Citation Index Expanded, until 5 June 2020. We applied no language or document-type restrictions.

Selection Criteria

Studies assessing the diagnostic accuracy of US and AFP, independently or in combination, for the diagnosis of HCC in adults with chronic liver disease, with cross-sectional and case-control designs, using one of the acceptable reference standards, such as pathology of the explanted liver, histology of resected or biopsied focal liver lesion, or typical characteristics on computed tomography, or magnetic resonance imaging, all with a six-months follow-up.

Data Collection and Analysis

We independently screened studies, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias and applicability concerns, using the QUADAS-2 checklist. We presented the results of sensitivity and specificity, using paired forest-plots, and tabulated the results. We used a hierarchical meta-analysis model where appropriate. We presented uncertainty of the accuracy estimates using 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We double-checked all data extractions and analyses.

Main Results

We included 373 studies. The index-test was AFP (326 studies, 144,570 participants); US (39 studies, 18,792 participants); and a combination of AFP and US (eight studies, 5454 participants). We judged at high-risk of bias all but one study. Most studies used different reference standards, often inappropriate to exclude the presence of the target condition, and the time-interval between the index test and the reference standard was rarely defined. Most studies with AFP had a case-control design. We also had major concerns for the applicability due to the characteristics of the participants. As the primary studies with AFP used different cut-offs, we performed a meta-analysis using the hierarchical-summary-receiver-operating-characteristic model, then we carried out two meta-analyses including only studies reporting the most used cut-offs: around 20 ng/mL or 200 ng/mL. AFP cut-off 20 ng/mL: for HCC (147 studies) sensitivity 60% (95% CI 58% to 62%), specificity 84% (95% CI 82% to 86%); for resectable HCC (six studies) sensitivity 65% (95% CI 62% to 68%), specificity 80% (95% CI 59% to 91%). AFP cut-off 200 ng/mL: for HCC (56 studies) sensitivity 36% (95% CI 31% to 41%), specificity 99% (95% CI 98% to 99%); for resectable HCC (two studies) one with sensitivity 4% (95% CI 0% to 19%), specificity 100% (95% CI 96% to 100%), and one with sensitivity 8% (95% CI 3% to 18%), specificity 100% (95% CI 97% to 100%). US: for HCC (39 studies) sensitivity 72% (95% CI 63% to 79%), specificity 94% (95% CI 91% to 96%); for resectable HCC (seven studies) sensitivity 53% (95% CI 38% to 67%), specificity 96% (95% CI 94% to 97%). Combination of AFP (cut-off of 20 ng/mL) and US: for HCC (six studies) sensitivity 96% (95% CI 88% to 98%), specificity 85% (95% CI 73% to 93%); for resectable HCC (two studies) one with sensitivity 89% (95% CI 73% to 97%), specificity of 83% (95% CI 76% to 88%), and one with sensitivity 79% (95% CI 54% to 94%), specificity 87% (95% CI 79% to 94%). The observed heterogeneity in the results remains mostly unexplained, and only in part referable to different cut-offs or settings (surveillance programme compared to clinical series). The sensitivity analyses, excluding studies published as abstracts, or with case-control design, showed no variation in the results. We compared the accuracy obtained from studies with AFP (cut-off around 20 ng/mL) and US: a direct comparison in 11 studies (6674 participants) showed a higher sensitivity of US (81%, 95% CI 66% to 90%) versus AFP (64%, 95% CI 56% to 71%) with similar specificity: US 92% (95% CI 83% to 97%) versus AFP 89% (95% CI 79% to 94%). A direct comparison of six studies (5044 participants) showed a higher sensitivity (96%, 95% CI 88% to 98%) of the combination of AFP and US versus US (76%, 95% CI 56% to 89%) with similar specificity: AFP and US 85% (95% CI 73% to 92%) versus US 93% (95% CI 80% to 98%).

Authors' Conclusions

In the clinical pathway for the diagnosis of HCC in adults, AFP and US, singularly or in combination, have the role of triage-tests. We found that using AFP, with 20 ng/mL as a cut-off, about 40% of HCC occurrences would be missed, and with US alone, more than a quarter. The combination of the two tests showed the highest sensitivity and less than 5% of HCC occurrences would be missed with about 15% of false-positive results. The uncertainty resulting from the poor study quality and the heterogeneity of included studies limit our ability to confidently draw conclusions based on our results.

### Diagnostic approach to the patient with a suspected inherited platelet disorder: who and how to test [^1a1b083a]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2021). Medium credibility.

Bleeding and thrombocytopenia are common referrals to the pediatric and adult hematology practice. The differential diagnosis encompasses a wide spectrum of entities that vary in acuity, severity, and etiology. Most will be acquired (especially in adult patients), but many can be inherited, and some may have manifestations affecting other organ systems. The first step: defining whether the symptoms and/or laboratory findings are clinically significant and warrant additional work-up, can be equally as challenging as reaching the diagnosis itself. How much bleeding is too much to be considered normal? How low of a platelet count is too low? Once the decision has been made to pursue additional studies, considering the increasing number of laboratory tests available, the diagnostic process can be complex. In this article, we outline a general approach for the evaluation of patients in whom an inherited platelet disorder is being considered. We present two clinical vignettes as introduction to the diagnostic approach to inherited platelet disorders. We describe the rationale for the different types of tests that are clinically available, their limitations, and finally the challenges that are frequently encountered in the interpretation of results. We also intend to provide some guidance on the expected phenotype in terms of severity of bleeding and/or thrombocytopenia according to the etiology of the inherited disorder. Our goal is to provide the practicing hematologist with a practical framework that is clinically applicable in their daily practice.

### Prenatal features in Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome and indications for prenatal testing [^4df0b312]. Journal of Medical Genetics (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Most cases of Beckwith-Wiedemann spectrum (BWSp) are diagnosed after birth and few studies evaluated the prenatal phenotype; here, we investigate these aspects in a large series of patients with BWSp.

Methods

Eighty-nine patients with BWSp recruited through the BWSp Internal Registry of the Pediatric Genetics Unit of the Regina Margherita Children's Hospital of Torino and through the Italian Association of Patients with BWSp. Data collection was conducted through administration of a personalised questionnaire, interview to patients' parents, review of the clinical records, including prenatal ultrasound (US) and biochemical screening tests, physical examination and review of clinical and molecular data of the patients.

Results

Seventeen patients (19.1%) were conceived through assisted reproductive techniques (ART). Twinning occurred in nine pregnancies (three from ART). Pregnancy biochemical screening tests showed increased alpha-fetoprotein (1.52 ± 0.79multiples of median (MoM), p = 0.001), uEstriol (1.37 ± 0.38MoM, p < 0.001) and total human chorionic gonadotrophin (2.14 ± 2.12MoM, p = 0.008) at 15–18 weeks (n = 28). Morphology US scan revealed abdominal and head circumferences higher than normal (1.42 ± 1.10SD scores, p < 0.001and 0.54 ± 0.88, p < 0.001, respectively) with normal femur lengths. Sixty-four cases (71.9%%) had a various combination of US findings, including macrosomia (n = 32), omphalocele (n = 15), enlargement of abdominal organs (n = 6), macroglossia (n = 11), adrenal cysts/masses (n = 2), nephroureteral anomalies (n = 11), polyhydramnios (n = 28), placental enlargement (n = 2) or mesenchymal dysplasia (n = 4).

Conclusion

We propose a clinical scoring system for prenatal molecular investigations defining major, minor and supportive criteria among the several features often observed prenatally in BWSp.

Treatment of serum with methylamine to inactivate A2M

In order to measure K ass for serum A1AT with NE or PR3, it was first necessary to inactivate the other major serum inhibitor of NSPs, alpha-2-macroglobulin (A2M). This was achieved by treating the serum samples with 0.1 M methylamine (Fisher Scientific, UK) for 10 minutes at 37°C. The inactivation of A2M was confirmed indirectly by measuring NE and PR3 inhibition by serum samples with and without treatment with methylamine. The substrate used for these experiments was N-Methoxysuccinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Val p-nitroanilide (MSaapvN; Sigma-Aldrich, UK) at 0.6 mg/ml in 0.1 M Hepes, pH 7.5, 9.5% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO).

Measurement of K ass for A1AT variants and NE

Pure NE of known activity was diluted to an active concentration of 100nM with buffer (50 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 0.05% Igepal CA-630 (v/v)). Methylamine-treated serum samples or pure M or Z variant A1AT were also diluted to an A1AT concentration of 100nM (Z variant A1AT purified from human plasma was a kind gift from the research group of Prof. D. Lomas, University of Cambridge, UK), and these samples were titrated against NE to determine the percentage of active A1AT. Following this initial step, the time-dependent measurements were performed by incubating equimolar amounts of NE and active A1AT (1nM each) in a 1 mL polystyrene cuvette with a 1 cm pathlength at 23°C. Residual NE activity at 1–5 minutes was measured by the addition of 200 μL of MSaapvN and measurement of the change in absorbance (410 nm) over 10 minutes using a spectrophotometer (Jasco V550). At each time point, the percentage of NE inhibition was determined. The K ass was calculated by plotting the inverse of NE activity at each time point versus time. From the linear portion of the slope, the half time (t½) of the reaction was calculated using the formula:

K ass was calculated using the equation;

This was also apparent when survival was analysed in subgroup of patients who underwent surgery. A similar impact of AFP on survival was noted in patients with HCC having viral aetiology. Similarly, AFP is a well-known marker that predicts the outcome after liver transplantation for HCC.

Laboratory investigations revealed normal values for creatine kinase and hepatic enzymes (ASAT, ALAT) at birth, which were elevated twofold at 10 months of age. Investigation of lipid values revealed slightly elevated total triglycerides (3.36 mmol/l; normal (N < 2.26 mmol/l). His cholesterol values were normal, however, his leptin levels were reduced to < 0.2 µg/l (N > 0.35 µg/l). He presented with hypothyroidism, which was successfully treated by L-thyroxin supplementation. His differential blood count showed hyperleukocytosis with polynuclear neutrophils and low platelet counts. At 4 years of age triglycerides were slightly elevated (2.41 mmol/l; N < 2.26 mmol/l). Platelets were still low at 101 × 10⁹ /l (N > 193 × 10⁹ /l). Genetic analysis by array-CGH and clinical exome sequencing revealed no pathogenic variants in known disease genes explaining this combination of symptoms.

Disease gene identification

To decipher the genetic basis of the observed phenotype we performed trio-genome sequencing (GS) of the affected individual and his parents. Variants were evaluated using the Varfish platform (Holtgrewe et al.). We assumed an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance. Initially, we tested genes associated with different forms of lipodystrophy from Genomics England PanelApp (Lipodystrophy - childhood onset (Version 4.50); ID: R158) and all candidates listed in Supplementary Table 4. to investigate whether a variant affecting a known disease gene was initially missed. We could not find any variant explaining the observed phenotype in line with the negative result from clinical exome sequencing. Next, we performed genome-wide filtering for rare homozygous or compound heterozygous variants. In addition, we tested for de novo variants in case the assumption of an autosomal recessive mode was incorrect. This approach revealed two heterozygous variants in SUPT7L (NM_014860.3).

Extracolonic surveillance in FAP/MAP/attenuated polyposis (Recommendations 10–12) includes upper gastrointestinal, thyroid, and pediatric screening: Screening for gastric and proximal small bowel tumors should be done using upper endoscopy including duodenoscopy starting at age 25–30 years, and surveillance should be repeated every 0.5–4 years depending on Spigelman stage of duodenal polyposis: 0 = 4 years; I = 2–3 years; II = 1–3 years; III = 6–12 months, and IV = surgical evaluation; stomach examination should include random sampling of fundic gland polyps, and surgery should be reserved for high-grade dysplasia or cancer (strong recommendation, very low quality of evidence). Annual thyroid screening by ultrasound should be recommended to individuals affected with FAP, MAP, and attenuated polyposis (conditional recommendation, low quality of evidence). Biannual screening should be offered to affected infants until age 7 years with α-fetoprotein and ultrasound (conditional recommendation, very low quality of evidence).

### Infantile hemangioendothelioma with elevated serum alpha fetoprotein: report of 2 cases with immunohistochemical analysis [^b21168ab]. Human Pathology (2010). Low credibility.

Infantile hemangioendothelioma is the most common benign mesenchymal tumor of the liver presenting during the first 6 months of life. Serum alpha fetoprotein is an important tumor marker for hepatoblastoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, and germ cell tumors. However, it is rarely elevated in patients with hepatic infantile hemangioendothelioma. In such cases, surgery may be done to rule out malignancies when alpha fetoprotein levels are high. The etiology of the elevated alpha fetoprotein level has not yet been elucidated. We report 2 cases of solitary hepatic infantile hemangioendothelioma and demonstrate immunohistochemically that hepatocytes near or entrapped within the tumor were the source of the increased serum levels of alpha fetoprotein explaining the unusual clinical presentation.

Table 4
Median values of umbilical cord plasma α-foeto protein (AFP), by levels of standardised birth weight), AFP was fairly uniform for both groups, but at each level of birth weight, the absolute value of AFP was approximately twice as high in the pre-eclampsia group as in controls. Adjustment for length of gestation (in days) attenuated the positive association between severe pre-eclampsia and AFP (Table 5

The pathophysiology of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is widely accepted to reflect an abnormal inflammatory response to the inhalation of toxic agents, especially cigarette smoke. This is supported by the development of multiple transgenic and knockout mice that either develop "emphysema-like" changes spontaneously or become more resistant or susceptible to cigarette smoke exposure.

These studies have their origin in the observation some 60 years ago of several subjects with a circulating deficiency of alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) associated with severe early onset basal panlobular emphysema. Once recognized as a clinical and familial entity, targeted testing confirmed the association. Index was the term used for those identified by testing symptomatic subjects and nonindex for those identified by chance or family screening. Nonindex cases were generally younger with better preserved lung function, suggesting an earlier stage of evolution of the disease.

Because AAT was recognized as an inhibitor of neutrophil elastase (NE), which can replicate many of the features of COPD, the concept of an NE/AAT imbalance became, and remains, the cornerstone of the pathophysiology of COPD and, specifically, AAT deficiency.

Logically, supplementation of AAT should restore the normal NE/AAT physiological balance in the lung. In the early 1980s, AAT was purified from human blood and shown to increase recipient AAT in both blood and the lungs, falling over seven days to levels still above baseline (∼12 μM). It was argued that this was still protective because other AAT variants with levels above this were not at increased risk for COPD. In vitro experiments confirmed excess connective tissue damage with ZZ plasma was greatly abrogated by MM plasma and decreasing ambient level with SZ; MS and MZ plasma had a similar effect, enabling physiological NE activity to take place while preventing excessive damage. The authors concluded a target threshold of 11 μM was largely "protective".

### Hemiatrophy [^e63e2d2a]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2002). Low credibility.

The authors present a series of seven patients who have a diagnosis fitting that of combined ipsilateral facial and somatic hemiatrophy. Diagnostic features include facial, tongue, and ear asymmetry and associated decreases in length and size of the ipsilateral limbs. The symptomatic problems related to leg length discrepancy can be addressed in the usual fashion, and this condition does not appear to progress to large leg length discrepancies. The cosmetic side of this disorder is often concerning: it is the most reliable identification of the existence of this condition and is present from birth. Facial hemiatrophy is mild and does not appear to be progressive. The hemiatrophies probably have a multifactorial pathogenesis that most likely has at its basis a genetic cause.

### Alpha-foetoprotein in umbilical cord in relation to severe pre-eclampsia, birth weight and future breast cancer risk [^f4ead28d]. British Journal of Cancer (2002). Low credibility.

The hypothesis that breast cancer may originate in utero implies that intrauterine factors that lead to higher birth weight increase the risk of breast cancer in female offspring. The evidence related to birth weight is suggestive, but not conclusive. Two large Swedish studies, however, have shown that women born after pre-eclamptic pregnancies have a risk reduction for breast cancer of more than 50%. The authors attributed this effect to lower intrauterine oestrogen influence on foetal breast tissue in pre-eclampsia. However, the results of two recent studies indicate that an alternative interpretation may be relevant, since α-foetoprotein (AFP), a glycoprotein produced by the foetal liver and yolk sac, also has anti-oestrogenic properties. Thus, a prospective study in Denmark has shown that high serum concentrations of maternal α-foetoprotein in pregnancy were related to lower risk of maternal breast cancer during follow-up. An inverse association between third trimester levels of AFP and subsequent risk of breast cancer has also been reported by an American study.

AFP enters the maternal circulation through the placenta and reaches its peak concentrations at the beginning of the third trimester. In animal models, AFP can inhibit growth of oestrogen dependent mammary carcinomas in vivo and recently, it has been shown that human AFP peptides may bind the oestrogen receptor and suppress breast cancer cell growth.

We have hypothesized that the anti-oestrogenic effect of pre-eclampsia could be mediated through high intrauterine levels of AFP, rather than low levels of oestradiol. We have further considered that an effect of severe pre-eclampsia could be related to reduced foetal growth. In a nested case–control study of pre-eclampsia in Norway, we have therefore compared oestradiol and AFP in umbilical cord plasma between cases of severe pre-eclampsia and control infants. We have also studied the relation between these two hormones in umbilical cord blood and infant birth weight.

### Isolated lateralized overgrowth and the need for tumor screening: a clinical practice resource of the American College of Medical Genetics and genomics (ACMG) [^88265d41]. Genetics in Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Isolated lateralized overgrowth — clinical evaluation and tumor screening recommendations (Table 2) state that any child with a suspected LO condition should be referred to a clinical geneticist or medical provider familiar with overgrowth conditions for evaluation, and diagnostic evaluation should be exhaustive and include testing of the affected tissue for overgrowth syndromes. If, after a thorough molecular evaluation, no molecular cause can be established in blood and affected tissue and criteria for a clinical diagnosis of Beckwith-Wiedemann spectrum (BWSp) are not met, the individual can be diagnosed with idiopathic isolated lateralized overgrowth (ILO). Clinicians should discuss tumor risk with parents; if comprehensive molecular work-up was performed including blood and affected tissue, tumor risk is likely < 5%, and a baseline abdominal ultrasound should be considered to assess for renal asymmetry. For symmetric kidneys (< 1-cm difference in size), tumor risk can be assumed to be < 1%, and ongoing screening may not be indicated, whereas for asymmetric kidneys (> 1-cm difference in size), ongoing screening for malignancy should be considered. If tumor screening is recommended or desired, the following are specified: abdominal ultrasound every 3 months until the third birthday then renal ultrasounds until the seventh birthday, serum alpha-fetoprotein measurement every 3 months until the third birthday, and physical examination every 6 months by a medical professional until the seventh birthday.

Tyrosine hydroxylase deficiency (THD) — urinary neurotransmitter metabolites: Urinary dopamine levels showed decreased values in 2/10 patients (20%), urinary epinephrine excretion was low in 1/10 patients, and urinary norepinephrine excretion was decreased in 7/10 patients (70%); overall, urine measurement of dopamine, epinephrine, and norepinephrine is not a reliable marker to diagnose THD as these parameters may be influenced by dietary intake, and urinary dopamine, epinephrine, and norepinephrine are not reliable diagnostic tools and should not be used to diagnose THD.

### Sticky platelet syndrome and thrombocythemia [^45930397]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Platelets are intimately involved in the pathogenesis of thromboembolic disorders, especially arterial forms of thrombosis. Although most arterial thromboses develop on the basis of endothelial injuries, some do not. In these instances "hyperactive" platelets could be the cause. Hyperaggregable platelets have been described in association with a number of acquired disease entities whereby the cause-and-effect relationship is unclear. In contrast, the sticky platelet syndrome is a congenital, autosomal dominant disorder, characterized by hyperaggregable platelets in response to ADP, epinephrine, or both. Patients usually seek treatment for transient or permanent arterial vascular occlusions. These are often precipitated by stressful events. Treatment with low-dose aspirin (81 mg/day) reverses clinical symptoms and hyperaggregability in the laboratory.

### Parkes-Weber syndrome in the emergency department [^7e8868ee]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Background

Parkes-Weber syndrome is a rare genetic disease with an unknown prevalence presenting with pathological capillary malformations and arteriovenous malformations affecting the same limb. The aetiology is due to a spontaneous or inherited RASA1 gene mutation involved in the development of the vascular system. At birth or during childhood, the capillary malformations clinically present as portwine stains, whereas the arteriovenous malformations present as hemihypertrophy, resulting in length/circumference discrepancies and spontaneous swelling associated with pain. The most significant life-threatening complication is high-output heart failure secondary to the arteriovenous malformations, resulting in cardiomegaly and pulmonary oedema.

Another syndrome commonly confused with Parkes-Weber syndrome is Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome, as both are associated with capillary malformations (portwine stains), hemihypertrophy and a deep tissue malformation. They can be distinguished, however, by the difference in appearance of the portwine stains and by the type of deep tissue malformations. The portwine stains of Parkes-Weber syndrome are salmon-coloured, in contrast to dark purple in Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome; and the deep malformations of Parkes-Weber syndrome are arteriovenous malformations, whereas those in Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome are venous malformations. Therefore, although both syndromes have similarities, the symptoms and treatments are vastly different.

### Treatment of inherited thrombocytopenias [^99963bca]. Haematologica (2022). Medium credibility.

The search for parameters predicting delivery-related bleeding in the mother suggested that hemorrhages requiring blood transfusion were more frequent in women with a history of severe bleedings before pregnancy and with platelet count < 50 × 10⁹/L. A surprising finding was the similar incidence of bleeding at delivery in those mothers receiving and those not receiving prophylactic platelet transfusions. However, platelet count was lower in women given transfusions, and this suggests that prophylactic platelet infusions were effective in reducing the frequency of hemorrhages.

The second study analyzed 829 surgical procedures carried out in 423 patients with well-defined forms of inherited platelet disorders, including 185 subjects with IT. Also in this context, bleeding was more frequent in IT than in healthy subjects, and a platelet count < 68 × 10⁹/L, as well as a history of previous hemorrhages, predicted these events. The presence of functional platelet defects associated with thrombocytopenia (Table 1) also had a negative prognostic value. As in the study on pregnancy, platelet transfusions were given more frequently to patients with severe thrombocytopenia, and this is probably the reason why bleeding was similar in those subjects receiving and those not receiving this prophylactic treatment. Of note, this study also suggested that prophylactic treatments other than platelet transfusions were effective in reducing bleeding at surgery (see below).

### Guideline on the investigation, management and prevention of venous thrombosis in children [^4d30b026]. British Journal of Haematology (2011). Medium credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for venous thromboembolism in children, more specifically with respect to testing for inherited thrombophilia, BSH 2011 guidelines recommend to recognize that testing for inherited thrombophilia after a first episode of VTE has uncertain predictive value for recurrence. Do not use the results of testing for inherited thrombophilia, factor VIII levels, and D-dimer as sole determining factors for the duration of anticoagulation in pediatric patients, as these decisions are not evidence-based.

### Pre-treatment alphafeto protein in hepatocellular carcinoma with non-viral aetiology-a prospective study [^60004fc9]. BMC Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

In this cohort of patients with non-viral aetiology, 41% patients had AFP above the reference range while 23% had AFP over 400 ng/ml. higher percentage of larger, vascular invading and advanced stage tumours had AFP level over 400 ng/ml. Surgical candidates had a lower AFP levels. Having AFP over 400 ng/ml predicted poor outcome after surgery.

Worldwide pattern of aetiology of HCC seem to be changing. Previously dominated hepatitis B and C are falling in incidence due to vaccination and effective treatment. Non-viral HCC is becoming the predominant variety. With this change in pattern of disease, it is worth re-evaluating the previously used criteria in managing HCC.

Serum alpha-fetoprotein is a traditional tumour maker used in HCC screening and surveillance. Sensitivity and specificity of AFP in diagnosing HCC varies widely and depends on the cut off level. Variations in the AFP levels depending on the etiology have been observed before. In a cohort of patients with hepatitis B related HCC, AFP at 200 ng/ml and 400 ng/ml showed a sensitivity of 79.8% and 91.5% respectively. In another study specificity was 50% in HBV-positive patients compared to 78% in HBV-negative patients.

Limited number of researchers has looked in to the value of AFP in HCC of non-viral aetiology. In our study population of non-viral aetiology, 58.8% had normal AFP levels (< 10 ng/ml). Low levels of AFP positivity was also seen in a study done by Murugavel et al. where they studies a group of HCC patients with mixed aetiology. In their study AFP positivity was 20.5% (negative in 79.5%) when the patients were of non viral aetiology. This is comparable with our findings. Patients with non-viral aetiology seem to have a lower AFP levels. Thomson et al. in a systematic review on screening a cohort of mixed aetiology HCC came to the conclusion that screening ultrasound is cost effective when it is offered to patients with an AFP value more than 20 ng/ml. With This criterion applied to our study it would miss 48% of the patients with HCC. Using AFP as a screening or diagnostic investigation seem to be unreliable in them. Block et al. in their study of molecular pathology of viral HCC indicated high hepatocyte turnover in these patients. Relatively lower AFP in non-viral HCC could be related to low rate of hepatocyte turn over.

### Diagnostic and mechanistic implications of serum free light chains, albumin and α-fetoprotein in hepatocellular carcinoma [^b914c3f1]. British Journal of Cancer (2014). Low credibility.

As noted in Figure 1, most values within the control group fell within the reference range, but in the HCC group, levels were signifcantly higher across all aetiology groups. Gamma globulin was moderately directly related to both FLCs (κ and λ) with an R² figure of 0.37 and 0.33, respectively, while it was moderately inversely related to serum albumin with an R² value of 0.34 (Figure 4A–C).

Finally, we explored the relationship between serum albumin and gamma globulin as assessed by the difference between total protein and albumin, or by individual immunoglobulin subgroups, that is, IgG, IgA and IgM. There was a moderate inverse relationship between serum albumin and the difference between total protein and albumin (i.e. the gamma globulin fraction) with an R² value of 0.42 (Figure 5A). Among all the immunoglobulins, the relationship of IgG and albumin was most akin to the overall gamma globulin in relation to albumin as indicated by equal slopes (Figure 5B).
