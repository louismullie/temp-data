## Question

work up for chronic elevated liver enzymes

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for a stepwise workup for chronic elevated liver enzymes. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming chronicity and characterizing the biochemical pattern of injury. Then, I should obtain a targeted history and initial laboratory panel. Next, I'll risk-stratify fibrosis noninvasively and decide on imaging. After that, I will pursue condition-specific secondary testing, consider elastography and referral, and finally reserve liver biopsy for unresolved diagnostic questions, while noting special populations and drug-induced liver injury signals throughout [^1155Yms9] [^117MpALN].

> Let me first confirm persistence and chronicity, because transient abnormalities are common and context matters. Wait, let me verify the retesting data: in primary care cohorts, 84% of abnormal liver tests remained abnormal at one month and 75% at two years, so repeating the panel alone does not typically normalize the issue, yet a single repeat in 1–3 months can be reasonable if the elevation is mild and the patient is asymptomatic after excluding obvious acute causes such as intercurrent illness, new drugs, or recent heavy alcohol use [^113XoUqa]. Hold on, I need to ensure we do not equate the magnitude of enzyme elevation with prognosis; outcomes are driven by etiology and fibrosis, and ALT is not a "liver function" test, so I should avoid false reassurance from modest values and avoid alarm from marked values taken out of context [^117VSnab] [^116xdYTr].

> Next, I should define the pattern of injury, because pattern recognition narrows the differential and guides tests. I will classify as hepatocellular when AST/ALT predominate, cholestatic when ALP/GGT predominate, mixed when both are concurrently elevated, and isolated hyperbilirubinemia when bilirubin is elevated with normal enzymes, and I will calculate the AST:ALT ratio since a ratio > 1 suggests advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis and should prompt urgent fibrosis assessment, though I should double-check for confounders such as alcohol and low ALT with sarcopenia before jumping to conclusions [^117MpALN] [^112XLmib] [^116MUPTF].

> Now I will take a comprehensive history and stratify risk. Let me consider alcohol, medications and supplements, metabolic syndrome, viral risks, autoimmune and hereditary clues, and extrahepatic mimics. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially wrote "AUDIT-C score > 100 U/L warrants fibrosis assessment", but that's incorrect wording; AUDIT-C is a questionnaire, not a laboratory unit, and what I should have said is that harmful drinking warrants noninvasive fibrosis assessment and referral pathways, and programs often triage heavy drinkers, sometimes using thresholds like > 100 units/week, to elastography and specialist evaluation, so I should correct that phrasing now and proceed accordingly [^117J7mYC] [^1155DZgq] [^116wVLAe]. I need to check for drug-induced liver injury by carefully reviewing all prescription, over-the-counter, herbal, and dietary supplements, recognizing that DILI spans hepatocellular, cholestatic, or mixed patterns and can be transient or severe, guiding me to pause suspected agents when appropriate [^1166BbqX] [^112vVxoA].

> Next, I should order a streamlined but sensitive initial laboratory panel to anchor the evaluation. I will obtain ALT, AST, ALP, GGT, and total and direct bilirubin to characterize injury and cholestasis; albumin and INR to assess hepatic synthetic function; a complete blood count with platelets to inform fibrosis scoring; fasting glucose or HbA1c and a lipid profile for metabolic risk; hepatitis B surface antigen and hepatitis C antibody guided by risk; and iron studies with ferritin and transferrin saturation because hemochromatosis is a treatable cause that should not be missed, while using GGT to confirm that an elevated ALP is hepatic rather than bony in origin [^116MUPTF] [^115wEbB4] [^117MpALN] [^115eFu7U].

> Hold on, I should tailor first-line additions to the pattern. For cholestatic signals, I will add antimitochondrial antibody to screen for primary biliary cholangitis and keep primary sclerosing cholangitis in mind, whereas for hepatocellular signals with risk factors, I will include acute viral hepatitis serologies and pregnancy testing when appropriate, and for unexplained hyperbilirubinemia I will distinguish unconjugated from conjugated fractions and evaluate for hemolysis or Gilbert syndrome as indicated [^117MpALN] [^112XLmib]. But wait, what if the enzymes reflect extrahepatic disorders? I should double-check thyroid function, celiac serology, and creatine kinase when symptoms suggest endocrine, intestinal, or muscle disease, respectively, to avoid a liver-centric anchoring error [^113Yditq].

> I will now examine fibrosis risk because stage governs prognosis and referral more than enzyme levels. Let me calculate FIB-4 using age, AST, ALT, and platelets, with < 1.3 indicating low risk (often manageable in primary care with lifestyle measures and periodic monitoring), ≥ 1.3 prompting enhanced testing, and ≥ 2.67 suggesting a high probability of advanced fibrosis meriting urgent hepatology referral, remembering that cutoffs differ in special populations and tools are not validated in children, and that APRI and the AST:ALT ratio can provide supportive signals when platelets are available or ALT is low [^111EWoPD] [^1141bnYV] [^116MUPTF] [^1155DZgq].

> Next, I should obtain abdominal ultrasound for patients with persistent enzyme elevation or any cholestatic pattern, to assess parenchyma, biliary tree, steatosis, masses, and portal features. If ultrasound is negative or unclear but MASLD remains likely, I need to consider ultrasound-based controlled attenuation parameter to quantify steatosis, recognizing that this can refine staging and counseling in metabolic disease pathways [^11571hhv] [^1155tM6b]. Let me verify that if an incidental focal lesion appears, contrast-enhanced imaging and a structured cancer and medication history are indicated to classify benign versus malignant etiologies before invasive steps [^1148P7xy].

> Based on initial data, I will pursue condition-specific tests. If autoimmune hepatitis is suspected, I should obtain ANA, SMA, anti–LKM-1, and IgG, understanding imaging plays a limited role for AIH diagnosis and that histologic remission remains the most stringent endpoint, while remaining cautious not to conflate drug-induced AIH with idiopathic AIH without histologic and clinical correlation [^116a72Z7] [^111kKbpn]. If Wilson disease is on the table, I need to check ceruloplasmin, 24-hour urinary copper, and consider a slit-lamp exam, and if α-1 antitrypsin deficiency is suspected, I should measure level and phenotype, whereas persistent cholestatic profiles or suspected obstruction warrant MRCP or ERCP to define sclerosing cholangitis or stones and to guide intervention [^114c8Asx] [^117MpALN].

> If the FIB-4 is ≥ 1.3 or clinical features suggest advanced disease, I should confirm or exclude significant fibrosis noninvasively. Let me consider vibration-controlled transient elastography, where liver stiffness values above about 8 kPa suggest significant fibrosis and values above about 12–16 kPa suggest cirrhosis, and consider magnetic resonance elastography for indeterminate or technically limited cases, or the ELF panel as an alternative when imaging is unavailable, referring to hepatology for integration of results and management [^111EWoPD] [^1155tM6b]. Hold on, I should verify that in alcohol-associated liver disease pathways, noninvasive blood scores and elastography are also recommended to grade fibrosis and direct counseling and referral, which aligns with this algorithmic approach [^1155DZgq].

> Liver biopsy should be reserved for unresolved diagnostic uncertainty, discordant noninvasive results, or when histologic grading will alter management, such as differentiating atypical MASLD from autoimmune or drug-induced injury, or confirming overlap syndromes. I need to ensure that the pathologist is provided with the clinical pattern and competing etiologies to optimize interpretive yield, and I should remember that distinguishing idiopathic AIH from drug-induced AIH can be challenging because interface hepatitis and plasma cells are not pathognomonic, making clinical course and fibrosis context essential to interpretation [^1114y3Y5] [^111kKbpn] [^116HcWAh] [^11457Umx].

> Let me think about special populations and caveats. In children, noninvasive adult algorithms are not validated, and the cholestatic differential differs, so I should have a lower threshold for pediatric referral and integrate age-specific considerations like GGT utility and genetic cholestasis, while in pregnancy certain analytes shift physiologically and other changes mandate prompt evaluation, and in Turner syndrome, fluctuating enzyme elevations are common, requiring reassessment and referral if persistent or > 2× ULN [^112XLmib] [^116MUPTF] [^115LahNR] [^111M3tfK].

> But wait, I should also account for common transient or contextual factors that can mislead. Viral syndromes like COVID-19 frequently produce mild hepatocellular-predominant enzyme rises that track with systemic inflammation, so I need to interpret trends with the clinical picture, and for statins and other chronic cardiometabolic therapies, mild transaminase elevations are often self-limited and not a reason for automatic discontinuation absent other injury signals, reinforcing the importance of medication reconciliation before attributing causality [^113pbPRG] [^1141HZDQ].

> Next, I should review for drug-induced liver injury warning signs and institute monitoring or cessation thresholds when indicated. I need to check labeling and guidance for specific agents and remember Hy's law criteria as a strong predictor of severe DILI, and if ALT or AST are ≥ 3× ULN with bilirubin > 2× ULN without alternative explanation, I should interrupt the drug and investigate promptly, with closer surveillance in patients with baseline elevations or concomitant hepatotoxic drugs such as valproate where relevant [^1166BbqX] [^115k4dmG].

> Finally, I need to ensure follow-up is structured: document chronicity, reassess fibrosis risk periodically rather than repeatedly reordering the same panel, address lifestyle and cardiometabolic risk in MASLD, and refer when noninvasive thresholds or clinical red flags are met. Hold on, let me double-check that the goal is to link patients efficiently to fibrosis assessment pathways in the community to reduce missed advanced disease and unnecessary testing, which is central to high-value care in primary and specialty settings alike [^1141bnYV] [^1155Yms9].

A structured workup for chronically elevated liver enzymes begins with a **focused history and exam** [^1155Yms9] to identify alcohol, metabolic, medication, and viral risks, and to classify the pattern as hepatocellular, cholestatic, or mixed [^117MpALN]. Initial labs should include **ALT, AST, ALP, GGT, bilirubin, albumin, INR, CBC, and platelets** [^115wEbB4] [^117MpALN], plus **hepatitis B/C serologies, iron studies, and metabolic panels** [^113Yditq]. If enzymes remain elevated after 3–6 months or if advanced fibrosis is suspected [^111EWoPD], add autoimmune serologies, ceruloplasmin, alpha-1 antitrypsin, and celiac testing [^117MpALN] [^114c8Asx]; obtain abdominal ultrasound with elastography [^1155DZgq]; and use FIB-4/APRI to assess fibrosis risk [^1155tM6b] [^1141bnYV]. Refer to **hepatology** [^1155Yms9] for persistent unexplained elevations, advanced fibrosis, or suspected autoimmune or cholestatic disease, and consider liver biopsy if the diagnosis remains unclear or to stage disease severity [^1114y3Y5] [^116HcWAh].

---

## Initial clinical assessment

### History and physical examination

A thorough history and physical examination should quantify alcohol use and screen for alcohol use disorder [^117J7mYC] [^116wVLAe]; review prescription, OTC, and herbal medications and supplements for hepatotoxicity [^112vVxoA]; and **assess risk factors** including viral hepatitis (HBV, HCV), metabolic syndrome, obesity, diabetes, dyslipidemia, and family history of liver disease [^1155tM6b] [^113XN4Ar]. Elicit symptoms such as fatigue, pruritus, jaundice, abdominal pain, and weight loss, and look for signs of chronic liver disease (spider angiomas, palmar erythema, hepatomegaly) [^117MpALN].

---

## Laboratory evaluation

### Initial laboratory tests

Initial laboratory tests include:

| **Test** | **Purpose** |
|-|-|
| - ALT <br/> - AST | Hepatocellular injury [^112XLmib] [^117MpALN] |
| - ALP <br/> - GGT | Cholestatic injury [^112XLmib] [^113Fviv2] [^115eFu7U] |
| Total and direct bilirubin | Liver function and cholestasis [^112XLmib] [^112RBbyZ] |
| - Albumin <br/> - INR | Synthetic liver function [^112XLmib] [^117MpALN] |
| - CBC <br/> - Platelets | - Hematologic abnormalities <br/> - Thrombocytopenia [^112XLmib] [^115wEbB4] |
| - Hepatitis B surface antigen <br/> - Hepatitis C antibody | Viral hepatitis screening [^112XLmib] [^117MpALN] |
| Iron studies (ferritin, transferrin saturation) | Hemochromatosis screening [^113Yditq] |
| - Fasting glucose <br/> - Lipid profile | Metabolic syndrome assessment [^113Yditq] [^1155tM6b] |

---

### Pattern recognition

Interpreting **liver enzyme patterns** helps narrow the differential diagnosis:

- **Hepatocellular pattern**: Elevated ALT/AST suggests viral hepatitis, NAFLD, alcoholic liver disease, autoimmune hepatitis, or drug-induced liver injury [^117MpALN] [^1155tM6b].

- **Cholestatic pattern**: Elevated ALP/GGT suggests biliary obstruction, primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), or drug-induced cholestasis [^112XLmib] [^116SAcCw].

- **Mixed pattern**: Combination of hepatocellular and cholestatic injury [^112XLmib].

---

## Imaging studies

Imaging is essential to evaluate liver structure, steatosis, fibrosis, and biliary obstruction [^117MpALN]. Abdominal ultrasound is **first-line** for assessing liver parenchyma, steatosis [^11571hhv], and biliary obstruction [^112XLmib] [^116SAcCw], while transient elastography (FibroScan) provides non-invasive assessment of liver fibrosis [^1155DZgq] [^111EWoPD]. MRI or CT is reserved for advanced evaluation of focal lesions or complex biliary disease [^1148P7xy].

---

## Advanced laboratory testing

If initial tests are inconclusive or enzymes remain elevated for 3–6 months, **additional tests include**:

- **Autoimmune serologies**: ANA, ASMA, anti-LKM1, AMA, IgG, IgM [^112XLmib] [^11457Umx].

- **Wilson's disease**: Ceruloplasmin, 24-hour urinary copper [^113Yditq] [^114c8Asx].

- **Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency**: Serum alpha-1 antitrypsin levels [^113Yditq].

- **Celiac disease**: Tissue transglutaminase antibodies [^113Yditq] [^117MpALN].

---

## Indications for liver biopsy

Liver **biopsy** is indicated when **diagnosis remains unclear** despite comprehensive non-invasive evaluation [^1155Yms9], and for:

- **Suspected autoimmune hepatitis** or other inflammatory liver diseases [^11457Umx].

- **Assessment of fibrosis** when non-invasive tests are inconclusive [^1114y3Y5].

- **Persistent unexplained elevations** of liver enzymes [^117MpALN].

---

## Follow-up and monitoring

Regular **follow-up** is essential to monitor disease progression and response to interventions [^1155Yms9]. Repeat liver enzymes every 3–6 months; monitor fibrosis progression with non-invasive tests (FIB-4, APRI, transient elastography) [^111EWoPD] [^1141bnYV] implement lifestyle modifications (weight loss, alcohol cessation, control of metabolic risk factors) [^1155tM6b] [^116wVLAe] and refer to hepatology if advanced fibrosis, cirrhosis, or complex liver disease is suspected [^1155Yms9].

---

A structured, **stepwise approach** to persistently elevated liver enzymes — history, physical exam, labs, imaging, and selective biopsy — enables accurate diagnosis and management [^1155Yms9].

Regarding diagnostic investigations for metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease, more specifically with respect to initial evaluation, EASD/EASL/EASO 2024 guidelines recommend obtaining an evaluation for the potential etiology of steatotic liver disease. This should be conducted alongside tests for the presence of advanced fibrosis to determine the risk of liver-related and/or cardiovascular outcomes. These assessments inform appropriate care in patients with an incidental finding of steatosis.

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^112XLmib]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

There are three common patterns of abnormal liver test results, whose recognition can aid diagnosis:

- **Isolated raised bilirubin**: This is most commonly caused by Gilbert's syndrome, which affects 5–8% of the population. Consider haemolysis in patients with anaemia. Repeat liver blood tests on a fasting sample with a full blood count and both direct and indirect bilirubin. The total bilirubin should rise further due to the indirect component, and there should be no evidence of anaemia. If the patient is anaemic, haemolysis needs to be excluded by requesting a reticulocyte count, lactate dehydrogenase, and haptoglobin. If the unconjugated bilirubin is more markedly elevated (> 40 μmol/L), then rarer causes such as Crigler-Najjar syndrome should be considered, and genetic testing undertaken.

- **Cholestatic**: Predominantly raised ALP and GGT indicate cholestasis. Common causes include primary biliary cholangitis, PSC, biliary obstruction (such as stones, strictures, neoplasia, etc), hepatic congestion, and drug-induced liver injury. In children, additional disorders that may present with cholestasis include biliary tract abnormalities and genetic disorders of bile synthesis and excretion. However, an isolated raised ALP may be caused by vitamin D deficiency and not be liver-related. It may also relate to raised values during periods of rapid growth in childhood. Thus, the presence of a concomitantly elevated GGT can help confirm the cause of liver disease.

In children with specific inherited disorders of bile acid synthesis and transport, GGT is characteristically normal.

### Causes and evaluation of mildly elevated liver transaminase levels [^113Yditq]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Mild elevations in levels of the liver enzymes alanine transaminase and aspartate transaminase are commonly discovered in asymptomatic patients in primary care. Evidence to guide the diagnostic workup is limited. If the history and physical examination do not suggest a cause, a stepwise evaluation should be initiated based on the prevalence of diseases that cause mild elevations in transaminase levels.

- **Common causes**: The most common cause is nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, which can affect up to 30 percent of the population. Other common causes include alcoholic liver disease, medication-associated liver injury, viral hepatitis (hepatitis B and C), and hemochromatosis.

- **Less common causes**: These include α(1)-antitrypsin deficiency, autoimmune hepatitis, and Wilson disease. Extrahepatic conditions such as thyroid disorders, celiac disease, hemolysis, and muscle disorders can also cause elevated liver transaminase levels.

- **Initial testing**: It should include a fasting lipid profile; measurement of glucose, serum iron, and ferritin; total iron-binding capacity; and hepatitis B surface antigen and hepatitis C virus antibody testing. If test results are normal, a trial of lifestyle modification with observation or further testing for less common causes is appropriate.

Additional testing may include ultrasonography; measurement of α(1)-antitrypsin and ceruloplasmin; serum protein electrophoresis; and antinuclear antibody, smooth muscle antibody, and liver/kidney microsomal antibody type 1 testing. Referral for further evaluation and possible liver biopsy is recommended if transaminase levels remain elevated.

### Care of the patient with abnormal liver test results [^1155Yms9]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Liver tests are commonly performed in primary care and may signal the presence of acute or chronic liver disease. Abnormal results are defined by standardized, rather than individual, laboratory thresholds and must be interpreted in the context of a patient's history and examination. The pattern and severity of liver injury may provide clues about the cause of disease and should guide diagnostic evaluation with serologic testing and liver imaging. A systematic, stepwise approach to the evaluation and management of abnormal liver test results is recommended to optimize high-value care.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease, more specifically concerning the initial evaluation, AASLD 2023 guidelines recommend considering obtaining vibration-controlled elastography, magnetic resonance elastography, or enhanced liver fibrosis to exclude advanced fibrosis if the FIB-4 index is ≥ 1.3.

### Optimizing diagnosis from the medical liver biopsy [^1114y3Y5]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2007). Low credibility.

The histologic assessment of acute and chronic liver disease is based on an accurate description of the pattern of injury within the tissue specimen. Interpretation of the injury pattern requires review of the associated clinical and laboratory features. The morphologic interpretation achieves relevance only if it satisfactorily explains the clinical syndrome. Clinical characterization of the liver disease as having a hepatitic or cholestatic nature is useful in focusing the histologic assessment.

The principal histologic patterns have hepatitic, steatotic, biliary, granulomatous, vascular, and metabolic designations, and mixed clinical and histologic patterns are possible. The goal of this review is to optimize the yield from the liver biopsy examination by indicating the importance of a systematic analysis of the tissue specimen and the crucial need for correlating the clinical and histologic patterns of liver injury. Meaningful histologic interpretations reflect the collaborative effort of the pathologist and the clinical physician. Neoplastic changes typically are cytologic transformations rather than injury patterns, and they are not discussed here.

Regarding the use of flutamide PO in patients with chronic liver disease, Child-Pugh B (moderate):

- **Do not use**.
- **Monitor serum concentrations**: Monitor serum aminotransferases.
- **Baseline hepatic enzymes**: Baseline hepatic enzymes should be evaluated prior to treatment.

### Hepatic encephalopathy in chronic liver disease: 2014 practice guideline by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases and the European Association for the Study of the Liver [^114zUApH]. Hepatology (2014). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for liver cirrhosis, specifically in evaluating hepatic encephalopathy, the AASLD/EASL 2014 guidelines recommend that increased blood ammonia alone does not provide diagnostic, staging, or prognostic value for hepatic encephalopathy in patients with chronic liver disease. It is advised to reevaluate patients with a normal blood ammonia value.

### ACG clinical guideline: Alcohol-associated liver disease [^1155DZgq]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for alcohol-related liver disease, particularly concerning the initial evaluation, the ACG 2024 guidelines recommend obtaining noninvasive blood and/or imaging studies to assess the severity of fibrosis in patients with asymptomatic ALD. Use the Fibrosis-4 score, a blood-based marker, and hepatic transient elastography for fibrosis detection in patients with ALD.

### Alanine aminotransferase: A clinical and regulatory tool for detecting liver injury-past, present, and future [^116xdYTr]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2012). Low credibility.

Assay of the serum activity of the enzyme alanine aminotransferase (ALT) has become the primary screening tool for detecting acute liver injury. But what does an elevated value mean? Not what it is too often mistakenly believed to indicate. It is not a test of liver function. It does not necessarily predict worse effects to come in a given person. It is not a valid measure of the severity of liver injury or dysfunction. It is too unspecific to be reliable in screening for relatively rare effects on the liver. Although these are substantial limitations, ALT is a very useful biomarker if understood and used properly. It is important to consider how and why these erroneous concepts came to have such wide acceptance, and how elevations of ALT activity for evaluating patients and subjects under study might be interpreted better.

### ACG clinical guideline: Focal liver lesions [^1148P7xy]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for focal liver lesions, specifically in the initial evaluation, ACG 2024 guidelines recommend certain steps for the evaluation of asymptomatic patients without known liver disease and with an incidentally detected liver lesion:

- **Patient history**: History of previous cancer.

- **Constitutional symptoms**: Weight loss, loss of appetite, and fever.

- **Medication history**: Oral contraceptives and steroids.

- **Risk factors for chronic liver disease**: Viral hepatitis, transfusion history, tattoos, intravenous drug use, and alcohol excess.

- **Features of metabolic syndrome**: Obesity, dyslipidemia, insulin resistance, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease (CVD).

- **Blood tests**: Liver enzymes, tumor markers, and viral hepatitis panel.

- **Contrast-enhanced imaging**: Contrast-enhanced ultrasound, MRI, and CT.

### The liver in COVID-19: Prevalence, patterns, predictors, and impact on outcomes of liver test abnormalities [^116mgxHL]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2021). Low credibility.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused a global pandemic unprecedented in over a century, with approximately 35 million cases and more than 1 million deaths globally. Though predominantly a lower respiratory illness, other organ injuries are well-recognized. Among these, liver injury is of major interest.

- **Objective**: To define the prevalence, pattern, predictors, and impact of liver injury among patients hospitalized with COVID-19.

- **Methods**: Demographic, clinical, and biochemical data were collected retrospectively among patients admitted to St. Luke's University Hospital with COVID-19 between March 1 and April 18, 2020. The association of liver tests (LTs) with mortality and the need for mechanical ventilation, adjusted for demographic, clinical, and biochemical predictors, was examined.

- **Results**: Data were available on 551 patients. Prevalence of any or ≥ 3 × upper limit of normal transaminase elevation was 61.2% and 9.4% on admission, and 72.1% and 22.4% at peak. Bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase elevations were less common on admission (11.4% and 12.6%, respectively) and at peak (17.7% and 22%, respectively). All liver test elevations were consistently predicted by inflammatory markers. Hyperbilirubinemia predicted mortality on admission and at peak. Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) had opposite impacts on mortality, with AST positively and ALT negatively associated with mortality. Hence, besides hyperbilirubinemia, the AST:ALT ratio emerged as the best marker for mortality among the LTs.

- **Conclusion**: LT elevations among patients presenting with COVID-19 are significantly associated with increased mortality risk, highlighting the importance of monitoring these markers.

### Approach to the liver biopsy in the patient with chronic low-level aminotransferase elevations [^116HcWAh]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Pathologists sometimes encounter a liver biopsy from an asymptomatic patient with unexplained low-level parenchymal liver enzyme elevations. These biopsies often have minor histologic changes but are otherwise almost entirely normal. This can lead to the quandary of whether the features are clinically meaningful and how one must formulate a diagnosis from the possibly nonspecific findings of a near-normal biopsy. The following discussion focuses on the histologic changes that can be seen in these biopsies and the practical issues involved in making a diagnosis that provides useful information to the clinician. The literature and textbooks addressing the histologic and clinical features of these cases are reviewed with an emphasis on the clinical implications of finding nonspecific histologic alterations in these patients.

### Clinical practice guidelines for the care of girls and women with Turner syndrome [^111M3tfK]. European Journal of Endocrinology (2024). High credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for Turner syndrome, especially concerning liver damage, the ESE/PES 2024 guidelines recommend obtaining reassessment if liver enzymes are elevated at least two times the upper normal limit, as fluctuation is common. If liver function abnormalities persist, further evaluation should be conducted, and a referral to a gastroenterologist is advised.

### Liver enzyme elevation in coronavirus disease 2019: A multicenter, retrospective, cross-sectional study [^114eyJeX]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2020). Low credibility.

Elevated liver enzyme levels are observed in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); however, these features have not been characterized.

- **Methods**: Hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in Zhejiang Province, China, from January 17 to February 12, 2020, were enrolled. Liver enzyme level elevation was defined as alanine aminotransferase level > 35 U/L for men and > 25 U/L for women at admission. Patients with normal alanine aminotransferase levels were included in the control group. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction was used to confirm severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, and patients symptomatic with SARS-CoV-2 infection were defined as patients with COVID-19. Epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, treatment, and outcome data were collected and compared.

- **Results**: Of 788 patients with COVID-19, 222 (28.2%) had elevated liver enzyme levels (median [interquartile range {IQR}] age, 47.0 [35.0–55.0] years; 40.5% women). Being male, overweight, and smoking increased the risk of liver enzyme level elevation. The liver enzyme level elevation group had less pharyngalgia and more diarrhea than the control group. The median time from illness onset to admission was 3 days for the liver enzyme level elevation group (IQR, 2–6), whereas the median hospitalization time for 86 (38.7%) discharged patients was 13 days (IQR, 11–16). No differences in disease severity and clinical outcomes were noted between the groups.

- **Discussion**: We found that 28.2% of patients with COVID-19 presented with elevated liver enzyme levels.

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^115eFu7U]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

γ-Glutamyltransferase (GGT) is abundant in the liver and also present in the kidney, intestine, prostate, and pancreas, but not in bone; therefore, it can be useful in confirming that an elevated ALP is of liver and not bony origin. GGT is most commonly elevated as a result of obesity, excess alcohol consumption, or may be induced by drugs. Although an elevated GGT has a low specificity for liver disease, it is one of the best predictors of liver mortality. It is particularly useful in children to establish the likelihood of biliary disease when ALP is not a reliable indicator. Predominant causes of cholestasis in children include congenital abnormalities of the biliary tract and genetic disorders affecting bile synthesis and excretion.

### EASL clinical practice guidelines for the management of occupational liver diseases [^112PznxK]. Liver International (2020). High credibility.

Regarding the classification and risk stratification for occupational liver disease, particularly in severity grading, the EASL 2020 guidelines recommend considering dynamic evaluation. This includes repeated liver tests and liver stiffness measurements using transient elastography, or serum predictors of fibrosis such as Fib-4 and the AST to platelet ratio index, for staging the disease once the patient is removed from occupational exposure to suspected toxins.

### Liver biochemistries in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 [^113pbPRG]. Hepatology (2021). Low credibility.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) leads to elevated liver biochemistries in approximately half of patients on presentation. At the time of writing, data are limited regarding the trend of liver biochemistries over the course of illness. We aimed to evaluate the trend, etiology, and outcomes associated with liver biochemistries in COVID-19.

- **Approach and results**: A total of 60 patients with COVID-19 were admitted between March 21 and March 28, 2020. The mean age was 57 years, 65% were male, and 28% were Hispanic. At the study conclusion, 6 patients were deceased, 28 were discharged, and 26 remained admitted. Patients who remained admitted were followed for a median of 12 days.

Of 60 patients, 41 (69%) had at least one abnormal liver biochemistry on admission. Median aspartate aminotransferase (AST) was higher than alanine aminotransferase (ALT) at admission (46 vs. 30 U/L) and during the hospital course. Aminotransferases rose above normal in 54 (93%) patients, whereas alkaline phosphatase and total bilirubin elevations were rare. Ten (17%) patients developed aminotransferases more than 5 times the upper limit of normal. AST highly correlated with ALT throughout the illness course (r = 0.97; P < 0.0001), whereas correlations with markers of muscle injury and inflammation were weak.

Statin use was common before (40%) and during admission (80%) at our center, with no difference in peak liver biochemistries between users and nonusers. No demographic or comorbid illness was associated with liver injury. Admission AST (69 vs. 49; P < 0.05) and peak AST (364 vs. 77; P = 0.003).

### Exposure-safety analyses of nintedanib in patients with chronic fibrosing interstitial lung disease [^116nw4fF]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Exposure–liver enzyme elevations analyses were initially developed using data from combined IPF studies. Parametric time-to-first-event (survival) modeling was applied to investigate the relationship between nintedanib exposure and the probability of developing a liver enzyme elevation. The model was first fit to placebo-treated patients, where survival times were assumed to follow a Weibull distribution. This model was compared with a model assuming a constant baseline hazard. Subsequently, the nintedanib drug effect was included by simultaneously analyzing all patients (both placebo- and nintedanib-treated). Linear, log-linear, maximum effect (E max), and sigmoidal E max relationships on the log of the hazard were evaluated as drug effect functions, and both PopPK-predicted and observed C pre, ss values were used as exposure measures.

Finally, a stepwise covariate analysis consisting of univariate analysis (p = 0.05), forward inclusion (p = 0.05), and backward elimination (p = 0.001) was used to explore factors potentially influencing the exposure–safety relationship. Stricter criteria were used in the backward elimination step, as commonly done to reduce selection bias of the multiple covariate testing procedure. The covariates tested for IPF included age, height, gender, body weight, body surface area, Asian subpopulations, smoking status, and study.

The exposure–liver enzyme elevation model developed for IPF was subsequently applied to combined data from the IPF Phase II/III studies (TOMORROW, INPULSIS-1, INPULSIS-2) and the SENS.

### Time to focus on chronic liver diseases in the community: A review of primary care hepatology tools, pathways of care and reimbursement mechanisms [^1141bnYV]. Journal of Hepatology (2023). High credibility.

Addressing primary care's low confidence in detecting and managing chronic liver disease is becoming increasingly important owing to the escalating prevalence of its common lifestyle-related metabolic risk factors — obesity, physical inactivity, smoking, and alcohol consumption. While liver blood testing is frequently carried out in the management of long-term conditions, its interpretation is not typically focused on specific liver disease risk. Educational steps for primary care should outline how liver fibrosis is the flag of pathological concern; encourage use of pragmatic algorithms, such as the fibrosis-4 index, to differentiate between those requiring referral for further fibrosis risk assessment and those who can be managed in the community; and emphasize that isolated minor liver function test abnormalities are unreliable for estimating the risk of fibrosis progression.

Measures to increase primary care's interest and engagement should make use of existing frameworks for the management of long-term conditions so that liver disease is considered alongside other metabolic disorders, including type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and chronic kidney disease. Selling points when considering the required investment in developing local fibrosis assessment pathways include reduced repeat testing of minor abnormalities, improved secondary care referrals, and improvements in the patient's journey through long-term multimorbidity care. A focus on improving chronic liver disease is likely to have wide-ranging benefits across co-existing metabolic disorders.

### Elevated liver enzymes: Emergency department-focused management [^111MfEZb]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Liver function test (LFT) abnormalities are a common problem faced by emergency physicians. This issue has become more prevalent with the introduction of laboratory panels and automated routine laboratory testing. Fortunately, not all patients with irregularities in liver enzymes possess underlying pathology. This emergency medicine-focused review discusses the various biochemical tests, their biological basis, and an algorithmic approach to interpreting these abnormalities.

- **Objective**: Our aim was to provide emergency physicians with an overview of the evaluation and management of patients with elevated LFTs.

- **Discussion**: The liver is a complex organ with multiple roles. Key biochemical markers of hepatic function can be organized into the groupings of hepatocellular, cholestatic, or functioning liver, based on underlying enzymatic roles. Pathologic alterations to these markers can be algorithmically assessed by separating disease processes of these groupings, followed by assessment of the magnitude of enzymatic elevation. This review conducts an in-depth evaluation of the differential diagnosis and emergency department-centered clinical response of elevated LFTs based on subcategories of mild, moderate, and severe transaminase elevation.

- **Conclusions**: By understanding the biochemical basis of each LFT, it is possible to correlate laboratory findings to a patient's clinical presentation. An algorithmic approach can be taken to help narrow the spectrum of a differential diagnosis, which may assist providers in ensuring appropriate management.

### Risk stratification in autoimmune cholestatic liver diseases: Opportunities for clinicians and trialists [^1128gu8U]. Hepatology (2016). Low credibility.

Biochemical nonresponders represent the most readily identifiable at-risk group in PBC, and incorporating a step-wise algorithm with response criteria as the central feature is likely to capture the greatest breadth of individuals who will benefit from clinical trials (Figure 2A). Validation at interim time points for groups who commonly experience treatment failure is urgently needed and may assist in the earlier identification of high-risk patients. Along similar lines, prospective banking of biological materials with paired long-term clinical follow-up data could yield predictive markers from the point of diagnosis through interrogation of key pathways underlying nonresponse.

The few PBC patients who endure adverse events despite attainment of response remain poorly defined but are increasingly recognized; the additional impact of "biochemical escape" — wherein previous responders develop subsequent elevations in laboratory parameters — has yet to be explored. The additive predictive value of histology and its noninvasive surrogates to existing criteria also requires further validation in a manner similar to that presented for APRI, in addition to newer biochemical response criteria with dynamic predictive capabilities.

### Autoimmune hepatitis in practice, from diagnosis to complications: What is the role of imaging? A clinicoradiological review [^116a72Z7]. Clinical Imaging (2021). High credibility.

Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is a chronic inflammatory liver disease of unknown origin that can lead to liver cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), liver transplantation, or death. Diagnosis is performed using a multifactorial score. Treatment is based on a combination of immunosuppressants, aiming at clinical, laboratory, and histological remission, with the latter being the most challenging to achieve and prove. The absence of liver inflammation, as defined by biopsy, is the main determinant in remission or therapeutic modification. Imaging exams have a limited role in clinical management, with the main findings related to chronic liver disease.

- **Role of imaging**: Imaging's relevance lies mainly in excluding overlapping syndromes and assessing complications related to cirrhosis, such as in screening for HCC. In recent years, however, advances in the radiological literature have emerged regarding imaging biomarkers in liver disease, leading some authors to envision a future of virtual liver biopsy performed by magnetic resonance imaging.

The present study aims to review the role of imaging in the management of AIH in light of recent advances in the literature and to provide an illustrated guide with the main findings described in the disease.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for Turner syndrome, particularly in relation to liver damage surveillance, the ESE/PES 2024 guidelines recommend obtaining liver enzymes (ALT at a minimum) during childhood and every 1–2 years starting at age 10, continuing throughout the lifespan. For adult patients, AST, GGT, and ALP should be obtained in addition to ALT.

### AASLD practice guidance on drug, herbal, and dietary supplement-induced liver injury [^111kKbpn]. Hepatology (2023). High credibility.

The approach to liver biopsy interpretation is critical in evaluating a patient with suspected DILI. The first step involves determining the pattern of injury, as DILI can present with a variety of histological patterns. Approximately one-third to one-half of DILI cases will present with acute hepatocellular liver injury accompanied by necro-inflammatory histology, which may include acute or chronic hepatitis with or without mild cholestasis. This histological pattern is characterized by varying degrees of lobular inflammation, portal inflammation, interface hepatitis, apoptosis, granulomas, coagulative necrosis, and confluent or bridging necrosis.

A diagnostic challenge arises in distinguishing idiopathic AIH from drug-induced AIH (DI-AIH). Histologic features typically observed in AIH, such as interface hepatitis, emperipolesis (which is the presence of an intact cell within the cytoplasm of another), and rosette formation, are also observed among DILI cases (89%, 34%, and 40%, respectively, in DILI cases) and are not pathognomonic for AIH. DI-AIH may exhibit more portal neutrophilic infiltrates and be accompanied by cholestasis, whereas sporadic AIH may present with a chronic "hepatitis" pattern, with interface hepatitis dominated by plasma cells. The presence of fibrosis may assist in distinguishing AIH from DI-AIH.

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^113XoUqa]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

In response to abnormal liver blood tests, outcomes and pathways must be carefully considered. As indicated in Figure 1, the presence of unexplained clinical jaundice or suspicion of possible hepatic or biliary malignancy should lead to an immediate referral. For adults with incidentally raised liver enzymes, it is important to take a thorough history and perform a targeted clinical examination to identify the cause. While liver enzymes can occasionally be raised due to intercurrent illness, retesting after one month showed that 84% of these tests remained abnormal, and even after two years, 75% were still abnormal. Therefore, it is not recommended to simply repeat the same panel of tests unless there is a strong clinical suspicion of a transient issue.

In children, there should be a low threshold for referral to a pediatrician for further investigation, as the most common causes of liver dysfunction in adults differ from those in children, and the differential diagnosis is broader.

- **Response to abnormal liver blood tests**: This figure details the initial response to abnormal liver blood tests. Boxes in yellow indicate the initial evaluation of the clinical presentation. Patients with marked derangement of liver blood tests, synthetic failure, and/or suspicious clinical symptoms/signs should be considered for urgent referral to secondary care (red box). For the remainder, a clinical history alongside evaluation of the pattern of liver blood test derangement will determine the choice of pathway.

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^116MUPTF]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

The analysis from the BALLETS study was predicated on the identification of adults with established causes of liver disease, such as autoimmune liver disease, viral hepatitis, or metal storage disorders, which were found in just 5% of those with abnormal liver blood tests. Thus, these data would support a strategy of a streamlined panel with high sensitivity without generating large numbers of false positives, which have the potential to lead to greater patient anxiety, over-investigation, and considerably increased costs.

- **Recommendation 1**: Initial investigation for potential liver disease should include bilirubin, albumin, ALT, ALP, and GGT, together with a full blood count if not already performed within the previous 12 months.

If there is clear indication of a specific clinical risk — for example, in high-risk groups such as injecting drug users, migrants from high prevalence areas, or prisoners, then some aspects of second-line testing can be undertaken simultaneously. In many patients with liver damage, an assessment of liver fibrosis is critical in making decisions about referral and management. In adults, clues to the level of liver fibrosis can be gleaned from the use of non-invasive algorithms, such as the AST to ALT ratio. An AST:ALT ratio of > 1 indicates advanced fibrosis/cirrhosis; hence the inclusion of this ratio in algorithms has the potential to assess the risk of significant fibrosis in adults with abnormal liver blood tests. However, non-invasive markers have not been sufficiently validated in children to be routinely applied in clinical practice.

### EASL clinical practice guidelines: Drug-induced liver injury [^1166BbqX]. Journal of Hepatology (2019). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for drug-induced liver injury, particularly with respect to liver function tests (LFTs), the EASL 2019 guidelines recommend obtaining alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and total bilirubin (TBIL) as standard tests to define liver damage and liver dysfunction in patients with DILI.

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^115LahNR]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

Interpretation of abnormal liver blood tests requires an understanding of the context in which they arise. This can be illustrated in the extreme by comparing a patient receiving statin therapy who has an ALT of 80 U/L, is well, and requires continued treatment with the statin, with a patient with end-stage alcohol-related liver disease who has an ALT in the normal reference interval at 30 U/L and may have a life expectancy of weeks. A common assumption is that the detected abnormality represents the first presentation of abnormal liver function tests (LFTs), when it should be standard practice to review previous blood test records and past medical history before requesting additional investigations and referrals.

Another setting in which liver bloods are commonly abnormal but not necessarily of clinical concern is pregnancy, where alkaline phosphatase and serum albumin are often elevated and reduced, respectively. Other changes in liver bloods in this setting may indicate worsening of pre-existing disease or the development of pregnancy-related disease, which would warrant prompt investigation.

Abnormal liver blood test results should only be interpreted after review of the previous results, past medical history, and medical condition.

### Implication of normal liver enzymes in liver disease [^115UN9Jy]. Journal of Viral Hepatitis (2009). Low credibility.

Chronic liver disease is usually asymptomatic until its late stages. Significant hepatic necroinflammation and fibrosis may be present even with persistently normal ALT levels in HBV and HCV carriers or in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Given the large number of individuals who may harbor clinically significant liver disease despite normal alanine aminotransferase levels, more attention should be devoted to future research for alternative noninvasive markers of liver damage.

### Key characteristics of human hepatotoxicants as a basis for identification and characterization of the causes of liver toxicity [^114KGeMy]. Hepatology (2021). Low credibility.

Hazard identification regarding adverse effects on the liver is a critical step in safety evaluations of drugs and other chemicals. Testing paradigms for hepatotoxicity rely heavily on preclinical studies in animals and human data, including epidemiology and clinical trials. Mechanistic understanding of the molecular and cellular pathways that may cause or exacerbate hepatotoxicity is well advanced and holds promise for the identification of hepatotoxicants.

One of the challenges in translating mechanistic evidence into robust decisions about potential hepatotoxicity is the lack of a systematic approach to integrate these data to help identify liver toxicity hazards. Recently, marked improvements were achieved in the practice of hazard identification of carcinogens, female and male reproductive toxicants, and endocrine-disrupting chemicals using the key characteristics approach. Here, we describe the methods by which key characteristics of human hepatotoxicants were identified and provide examples for how they could be used to systematically identify, organize, and use mechanistic data when identifying hepatotoxicants.

### Elevated liver enzymes in inflammatory bowel disease: The role and safety of infliximab [^113fxYfo]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2016). Low credibility.

Abnormal liver enzymes are frequently encountered in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients. Infliximab has been implicated in inducing drug-induced liver injury, autoimmune hepatitis, or reactivation of hepatitis B virus. We aimed to clarify the role of infliximab in liver impairment in an IBD cohort.

- **Study**: A total of 305 patients with IBD, without evidence of chronic liver disease, were included in the study and retrospectively evaluated. Laboratory and clinical data were retrieved from a prospectively acquired database. In all, 176 consecutive patients treated with infliximab during the last five years were compared with a matched population of 129 patients who did not receive any antitumor necrosis factor treatment.

- **Results**: Elevation of alanine transaminase (ALT) was frequent in the entire population (36.4%), and it was not significantly associated with the use of infliximab (P = 0.284). Elevations more than three times the upper limit of normal were observed in 7.9%, and these resolved spontaneously in 83%. The use of immunomodulators was the only factor that was significantly associated with liver enzyme abnormalities in multivariate analysis [odds ratio (OR) 2.666, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.576–4.511, P < 0.005]. Overall, 39% of patients on infliximab had elevated liver enzymes, and this was associated with increased ALT before starting infliximab (OR 3.854, 95% CI 1.800–8.251, P = 0.001) and with a longer duration of infliximab treatment (OR 1.030, 95% CI 1.013–1.047, P = 0.001).

- **Conclusion**: Elevated liver enzymes are frequently found in IBD patients and they usually res.

### Alyftrek [^114SvBst]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Prior to initiating Alyftrek, obtain liver function tests (ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin) for all patients. Monitor liver function tests every month during the first 6 months of treatment, then every 3 months for the next 12 months, and at least annually thereafter. Consider more frequent monitoring for patients with a history of liver disease, elevated liver function tests at baseline, or a history of elevated liver function tests with drugs containing elexacaftor, tezacaftor, and/or ivacaftor [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Use in Specific Populations (8.7)].

- **Recommended dosage**: The recommended Alyftrek dosage in adult and pediatric patients aged 6 years and older is provided in Table 1. Administer Alyftrek orally (swallow the tablets whole) with fat-containing food, once daily, at approximately the same time each day [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Examples of meals or snacks that contain fat include those prepared with butter or oils or those containing eggs, peanut butter, cheeses, nuts, whole milk, or meats.

- **Dosage modification for strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitors**: Table 2 describes the recommended dosage modification for Alyftrek when used concomitantly with strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitors [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. Administer Alyftrek orally (swallow the tablets whole) with fat-containing food, once daily, at approximately the same time each day [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### Covid-19: Abnormal liver function tests [^1127LXx3]. Journal of Hepatology (2020). Low credibility.

Recent data on the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has begun to shed light on the impact of the disease on the liver. However, no studies at the time of writing have systematically described liver test abnormalities in patients with COVID-19. We evaluated the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in patients with abnormal liver test results.

Clinical records and laboratory results were obtained from 417 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 who were admitted to the only referral hospital in Shenzhen, China, from January 11 to February 21, 2020, and followed up to March 7, 2020. Information on clinical features of patients with abnormal liver tests was collected for analysis.

Of the 417 patients with COVID-19, 318 (76.3%) had abnormal liver test results, and 90 (21.5%) experienced liver injury during hospitalization. The presence of abnormal liver tests became more pronounced during hospitalization within two weeks, with 49 (23.4%), 31 (14.8%), 24 (11.5%), and 51 (24.4%) patients having alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, total bilirubin, and gamma-glutamyl transferase levels elevated to more than three times the upper limit of normal, respectively. Patients with abnormal liver tests of hepatocellular type or mixed type at admission had higher odds of progressing to severe disease (odds ratios [ORs] 2.73; 95% CI 1.19–6.3, and 4.44, 95% CI 1.93–10.23, respectively). The use of lopinavir/ritonavir was also found to lead to increased odds of liver injury (OR from 4.44 to 5.03).

### Liver biopsy in inflammatory bowel disease patients with sustained abnormal liver function tests: A retrospective single-center study [^112BohGA]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2022). Low credibility.

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic idiopathic gastrointestinal condition, with the main subtypes being Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). Several extraintestinal manifestations may be associated with both CD and UC, and the disease may have a profound impact on patients' quality of life.

Hepatobiliary disorders are common extraintestinal manifestations in IBD and may appear at any time during the natural course of the disease or in association with treatment. It is estimated that approximately 50% of patients may present abnormal liver function tests (LFT) during their disease course. Although these are most commonly transient liver enzyme elevations associated with an IBD flare, the spectrum of clinical manifestations is wide, ranging from an incidental finding in asymptomatic patients to more severe manifestations, including liver failure, liver cirrhosis, portal hypertension, and death.

These manifestations may be linked to IBD in several ways:

- **Disorders with a proven association with IBD**: These may possibly share a common pathophysiology, including primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) and autoimmune hepatitis (AIH).

- **Diseases directly and structurally related to intestinal inflammation**: Examples include portal vein thrombosis, liver abscesses, and granulomatous hepatitis.

- **Adverse events of IBD treatment**.

- **Disorders linked to the metabolic consequences of IBD**: These include cholelithiasis, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), and amyloidosis.

Considering this extensive differential diagnosis and wide spectrum of clinical manifestations, careful evaluation is essential.

### Elevated liver enzymes and comorbidities in type 2 diabetes: A multicentre analysis of 51 645 patients from the Diabetes Prospective Follow-up (DPV) database [^113XN4Ar]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2022). High credibility.

The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of elevated liver enzymes and associated diabetes-related comorbidities in type 2 diabetes (T2D). Between 2010 and 2019, data from 281,245 patients with T2D (aged 18–75 years) were collected across 501 Diabetes Prospective Follow-up (DPV) centers, resulting in an analysis of 51,645 patients with complete data on demographics and liver enzymes.

Elevated liver enzymes were found in 40.2% of all patients. However, only 8.6% of these patients had International Classification of Diseases-10 codes for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and/or nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. After adjusting for age, sex, diabetes duration, body mass index, and glycated hemoglobin, patients with elevated liver enzymes exhibited a higher prevalence of several conditions: arterial hypertension (P < 0.0001), dyslipidemia (P < 0.0001), peripheral artery disease (P = 0.0029), myocardial infarction (P = 0.0003), coronary artery disease (P = 0.0001), microalbuminuria (P < 0.0001), and chronic kidney disease (P < 0.0001) when compared to those with normal liver enzymes. The prevalence of elevated liver enzymes was lowest in patients receiving sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors or a combination of SGLT2 inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists.

In conclusion, elevated liver enzymes are common in patients with T2D and are clearly correlated with a higher prevalence of clinically relevant comorbidities. Therefore, assessing liver enzymes should be a standard clinical routine in T2D, given their potential predictive role for comorbidities and complications.

### EASL clinical practice guidelines: Drug-induced liver injury [^115xnbqU]. Journal of Hepatology (2019). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for drug-induced liver injury, specifically with respect to liver function tests (LFTs), the EASL 2019 guidelines recommend obtaining aspartate aminotransferase (AST) as a reliable substitute for alanine aminotransferase (ALT) in calculating the pattern of injury if ALT is unavailable at the time of DILI recognition, whereas gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) is less reliable as a substitute for alkaline phosphatase.

### Hepatotoxicity associated with protease inhibitor-based antiretroviral regimens with or without concurrent ritonavir [^111oRmHW]. AIDS (2004). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to determine the incidence of significant liver enzyme elevations following the initiation of protease inhibitor (PI)-based antiretroviral therapy (ART), with or without pharmacokinetic boosting with ritonavir (RTV), and to define the role of chronic viral hepatitis in its development.

- **Design**: Prospective cohort analysis of 1,161 PI-naive, HIV-infected patients receiving RTV-boosted (lopinavir, indinavir, and saquinavir) and unboosted PI-based ART (indinavir, nelfinavir) who had at least one liver enzyme measurement before and during therapy.

- **Methods**: The incidence of grade 3 and 4 liver enzyme elevations among persons with and without hepatitis B and/or C co-infection treated with PI-based ART were compared. Severe hepatotoxicity was defined as an increase in serum liver enzyme ≥ 5-times the upper limit of the normal range or 3.5-times an elevated baseline level.

- **Results**: The incidence of grade 3 or 4 elevations among PI-naive patients was as follows: nelfinavir, 11%; lopinavir/RTV (200 mg/day), 9%; indinavir, 13%; indinavir/RTV (200–400 mg/day), 12.8%; and saquinavir/RTV (800 mg/day), 17.2%. The risk was significantly greater among persons with chronic viral hepatitis (63% of cases); however, the majority of hepatitis C virus (HCV)-infected patients treated with nelfinavir (84%), saquinavir/RTV (74%), indinavir (86%), indinavir/RTV (90%), or lopinavir/RTV (87%) did not develop hepatotoxicity.

- **Conclusions**: Our data suggest that lopinavir/RTV is not associated with a significantly increased risk of hepatotoxicity among HCV-infected and uninfected patients compared with other regimens.

### How are abnormal results for liver function tests dealt with in primary care? Audit of yield and impact [^114FH32S]. BMJ (2001). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to determine whether abnormal results for liver function tests are investigated in primary care and to document the findings upon full investigation.

This was structured as a retrospective audit and prospective clinical investigation conducted within a university hospital and surrounding general practices, serving a population of approximately 330,000 people. The subjects included adults with abnormal liver function test results based on tests requested by their doctors between January 1 and June 30, 1995.

All patients with gamma-glutamyltransferase, alanine aminotransferase, or alkaline phosphatase levels at least twice the upper limit of the reference range were studied. A median of 15 months (range 12–21 months) later, their hospital attendance records and further investigations were examined. Where investigations were incomplete, records from general practice were also examined, and suitable patients were invited to attend the liver clinic.

The main outcome measures were the investigations requested by the doctor and the final diagnoses reached.

Results indicated that 933 patients with abnormal liver function tests were identified, and follow-up data were obtained for 873 (94%). Of these, 531 patients were already under hospital review. Among the remaining 342 patients, 157 were suitable for further investigation — the others had died, moved away, were elderly, or had repeat liver function tests with normal results. For 91 (58%) of these patients, no further tests were requested. Sixty-six had been partially investigated by their doctors, and in seven patients, results suggesting a treatable chronic liver disease had not been followed up. Upon investigation, 97 (62%) patients had an identifiable condition.

### Autoimmune hepatitis: Trust in transaminases [^115TRw6D]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Low credibility.

A rational and appropriate evaluation of liver biochemical tests is essential, given the increased number of abnormal laboratory results in asymptomatic patients. Critical judgement allows early diagnosis in the absence of typical clinical signs. Autoimmune hepatitis is a rare disease with high clinical variability. We present a child investigated for an unexplained increase in aminotransferases, discovered accidentally 2 months earlier in a standard laboratory panel approach. She was asymptomatic and no physical signs of chronic or acute liver disease were found. Laboratory investigation showed hypergammaglobulinaemia with selective elevation of IgG and a positive anti-liver cytosol type 1. Severe interface hepatitis was found on liver biopsy and treatment was initiated with steroids and azathioprine with good response. This case highlights the importance of trusting in any serum aminotransferase abnormality, even in asymptomatic children, and emphasizes the value of clinical suspicion and specific immunosuppressive therapy in prognosis.

### Mildly elevated liver transaminase levels in the asymptomatic patient [^114h9YzH]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Mild elevations in liver chemistry tests, such as alanine transaminase and aspartate transaminase, can reveal serious underlying conditions or present with transient and benign etiologies. Potential causes of liver transaminase elevations include viral hepatitis, alcohol use, medication use, steatosis or steatohepatitis, and cirrhosis.

The history should be thorough, with special attention given to the use of medications, vitamins, herbs, drugs, and alcohol; family history; and any history of blood-product transfusions. Other common health conditions, such as diabetes, heart disease, and thyroid disease, can cause or augment liver transaminase elevations. The recent American Gastroenterological Association guideline regarding the evaluation and management of abnormal liver chemistry tests proposes a practical, algorithmic approach when the history and physical examination do not reveal the cause.

In addition to liver chemistries, an initial serologic evaluation includes a prothrombin time; albumin; complete blood count with platelets; hepatitis A, B, and C serologies; and iron studies. Depending on the etiology, management strategies may include cessation of alcohol use, attention to medications, control of diabetes, and modification of lifestyle factors such as obesity. If elevations persist after an appropriate period of observation, further testing may include ultrasonography and other serum studies. In some cases, biopsy may be indicated.

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^1133f5Yq]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

Liver blood or function tests (LFTs), which are perceived to be inexpensive, are checked ever more frequently in both primary and secondary care. This is done in an attempt to exclude liver disease, for monitoring potential adverse effects of drugs on the liver, such as statins, and for investigating the generally unwell patient. These tests often produce abnormal results, the clinical significance of which is unclear. In many cases, they are requested in response to non-specific symptoms where there is little potential link between symptoms and the likelihood of liver disease, or the blood tests are performed for unrelated reasons such as chronic disease monitoring. This commonly leads to a cycle of additional liver blood test testing in an otherwise asymptomatic individual. Notably, most patients referred to hospitals with abnormal liver tests do not have any evidence of significant liver disease.

For example, University Hospital Birmingham Foundation Trust received 130,849 requests for liver blood tests in 2016, from 82 general practices, and of these, 38,636 (30%) contained at least one abnormal result, defined as being outside the stated reference range. The Abnormal Liver Function Investigations Evaluation (ALFIE) study from Tayside in Scotland showed that over a 10-year period, 25% of the community population aged over 16 had liver blood tests, with about a third having at least one abnormal value. Although an abnormal aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level was predictive of liver disease (HR = 4.2), the rate of detection was remarkable.

### Exposure-safety analyses of nintedanib in patients with chronic fibrosing interstitial lung disease [^115QtLbH]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

- **Exposure–liver enzyme elevation analyses**: For the initial analyses based on IPF data, the number of patients experiencing an ALT and/or AST elevation ≥ 3 × ULN across the treatment groups was low, with 38 patients experiencing events out of 895 nintedanib-treated patients and only 3 in the placebo group. Therefore, a parametric time-to-event model could not be fitted to the data from placebo patients, even if the model was reduced to a constant hazard model. By analyzing placebo and nintedanib-treated patients, a Weibull baseline hazard with a log-linear drug effect relationship between observed or predicted C pre, ss and the log of the hazard showed the best model performance (in comparison to a linear, E max, or sigmoidal E max function considering objective function values and parameter precision).

Gender had a significant influence on the risk of developing liver enzyme elevations, independent of exposure, with females having an approximately three- to fourfold higher exposure-adjusted risk than males. Although this trend was seen in both C pre, ss models, gender remained significant after the final step of covariate analysis only in the predicted C pre, ss model. Due to the consistent trend in visual predictive checks indicating a gender effect despite the limited number of events, this effect was retained in both models. Univariate analysis also identified patients with low height, low body weight, or low body surface area as having a significantly higher risk of a transaminase elevation. However, after adjusting for gender, these covariates no longer had a significant effect on the exposure.

### Exposure-safety analyses of nintedanib in patients with chronic fibrosing interstitial lung disease [^114uMpE7]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

The exposure–diarrhea analyses were congruent with the analyses focusing on liver enzyme elevations. These analyses were initially developed based on data from IPF studies. Parametric time-to-first-event (survival) modeling was applied to investigate the relationship between nintedanib exposure and the probability of developing an episode of diarrhea (any severity grade) over 52 weeks. Similar to the exposure–liver enzyme elevation analyses, the analysis consisted of three steps:

- **Time-to-first-event analysis**: Conducted on placebo-treated patients.
- **Addition of the effect of nintedanib exposure**: Evaluated the risk of experiencing diarrhea using observed and predicted C pre, ss by simultaneously fitting placebo- and nintedanib-treated patients.
- **Stepwise covariate analysis**: Included univariate analysis where p = 0.05, forward inclusion where p = 0.05, and backward elimination where p = 0.001.

Linear, log-linear, E max, and sigmoidal E max relationships were evaluated as drug effect functions. The same covariates as for the liver enzyme elevation variable were evaluated. However, since no exposure–diarrhea model could be established to describe the data, the covariate analysis was additionally performed for a model using categorical dose (instead of plasma exposure) as a predictor of diarrhea risk.

Exploratory analyses were performed to further differentiate between exposure and dose as predictors of diarrhea risk. Patients from the 100 mg BID treatment group were optimally matched by nintedanib exposure to patients from the 150 mg BID treatment group (1:2 matching).

Regarding diagnostic investigations for alcohol-related liver disease, more specifically with respect to initial evaluation, the ACG 2024 guidelines recommend counseling patients with heavy drinking and evidence of ALD detected through noninvasive tests about the risk of progressive liver disease. These patients should be referred to a hepatology specialist for further management.

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^112RBbyZ]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

Liver blood tests are readily available biochemical laboratory tests, with the standard panel varying from hospital to hospital. They have historically been referred to as liver function tests (LFTs). However, the predominant abnormality relates not to liver dysfunction but to elevations of hepatobiliary liver enzymes. For this reason, this guideline will refer to liver blood tests rather than LFTs, as it more accurately captures their usage in clinical practice. Hepatobiliary enzymes, when interpreted in isolation, convey information on the level of ongoing injury, whereas bilirubin, albumin, and INR convey information on liver function, with platelets conveying information on the level of fibrosis. In this guideline, an abnormal liver blood test is defined as being a value outside the standard reference interval, although there is emerging literature suggesting that the reference intervals for ALT may be too high.

Bilirubin is predominantly the by-product of the breakdown of the haem component of hemoglobin by the reticuloendothelial system. It exists in two forms: unconjugated and conjugated. Bilirubin is transported to the liver in its insoluble unconjugated form, where it is converted into soluble conjugated bilirubin to be excreted. Unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia is usually due to hemolysis or impaired conjugation, whereas conjugated hyperbilirubinemia is typically due to parenchymal liver disease or obstruction of the biliary system.

Most laboratories will routinely report total bilirubin, which comprises the unconjugated and conjugated fractions.

### Loss to follow-up in the hepatitis C care cascade: A substantial problem but opportunity for micro-elimination [^115MuokL]. Journal of Viral Hepatitis (2020). Low credibility.

Loss to follow-up (LTFU) during liver disease assessment (CHCOC step 4) remains a significant issue. Several diagnostic procedures are available to grade and stage liver disease. While liver biopsy was the standard of care in the past, noninvasive methods are now largely preferred. Liver fibrosis may be quantified using serological panels, such as the widely used FIB-4 (which incorporates the patient's age, platelet count, AST, and ALT levels) or the APRI score (utilizing AST levels, the AST upper limit of normal, and platelet count), or by employing transient elastography.

Almost all studies in the direct-acting antiviral (DAA) era employ noninvasive ways to assess liver disease severity. Among individuals attending their first visit post-diagnosis or referral, fibrosis was assessed with the APRI score in 52%-99% of cases (median 87%) [Suppl file 2,24,33] and with FibroScan in 59%-100% (median 79%) [Suppl file 9,12,22,25,27,30,34,35,40,41,50,53]. Studies employing other noninvasive measures or not reporting specific measures showed assessment rates in 48%-95% of attendees (median 88%) [Suppl file 20,21,25,26,36]. LTFU may contribute to this suboptimal assessment rate and should be addressed.

### Patients with elevated liver enzymes are not at higher risk for statin hepatotoxicity [^1141HZDQ]. Gastroenterology (2004). Low credibility.

Studies that evaluate the risk of hepatotoxicity from statins in hyperlipidemic subjects with elevated baseline serum transaminases are lacking. We conducted a study to test the hypothesis that patients with elevated baseline liver enzymes have a higher risk of statin hepatotoxicity.

- **Methods**: Our study consisted of the following three cohorts of patients seen between January 1, 1998, and June 31, 2002:
	- **Cohort 1**: 342 hyperlipidemic patients with elevated baseline enzymes (AST > 40 IU/L or ALT > 35 IU/L) who were prescribed a statin.
	- **Cohort 2**: 1437 hyperlipidemic patients with normal transaminases who were prescribed a statin.
	- **Cohort 3**: 2245 patients with elevated liver enzymes but who were not prescribed a statin.

	- The effect of statins on liver biochemistries was assessed over a six-month period after statins were prescribed. Elevations in liver biochemistries during follow-up were categorized into mild-moderate or severe based on predefined criteria.

- **Results**: The incidence of mild-moderate elevations and severe elevations in liver biochemistries in cohort 1 were 4.7% and 0.6%, respectively. Compared with cohort 1, individuals in cohort 2 had a lower incidence of mild-moderate elevations (1.9%, P = 0.002) but not severe elevations (0.2%, P = 0.2). However, between cohorts 1 and 3, there were no differences in the incidence of mild-moderate elevations (4.7% vs. 6.4%, respectively, P = 0.2) or severe elevations (0.6% vs. 0.4%, respectively, P = 0.6). Statin discontinuation during the follow-up was similar between cohorts 1 and 2 (11.1% vs. 10.7%, respectively).

### Clinical proof-of-concept results with a novel TRPA1 antagonist (LY3526318) in 3 chronic pain states [^117WhYEB]. Pain (2024). High credibility.

An important safety finding for LY3526318 during phase 2 development is an elevation in liver enzymes (ALT and/or AST) in a small number of participants not seen in the phase 1 study in healthy individuals. Five of the 314 participants randomized to LY3526318 in the 3 studies had aminotransferases elevated ≥ 3 × ULN, representing an incidence within the group of 1.6%. Of note, clinically important liver injury measured by ALT elevation is defined by experts as ≥ 5 × ULN. The CPMP study design made possible early identification of this low-incidence event by studying safety in a larger population across 3 disease states.

FDA guidelines state that finding of a higher rate of ALT/AST elevations in drug-treated subjects than in a control group is a sensitive but nonspecific signal of severe drug-induced liver injury (DILI). A more specific signal is a higher rate of aminotransferase elevations > 10 × ULN, and the single most specific predictor of a drug's potential for severe hepatotoxicity is aminotransferase elevation accompanied by increased serum total bilirubin (TBL), not explained by any other cause (Hy's law: e.g. ALT ≥ 3 × ULN and TBL > 2 × ULN). In the 3 studies here, no cases of Hy's law were identified, but 1 of the OA02 participants showed ALT elevations > 10 × ULN without TBL reaching 2 × ULN or clinical signs/symptoms of hepatotoxicity. However, the incidence of aminotransferase elevation was seen only in LY3526318-treated participants, and following a comprehensive evaluation, no alternative causes for the elevations were identified. It is highly possible that the hepatic signal is related to the drug.

### Extensive testing or focused testing of patients with elevated liver enzymes [^113vf1Rq]. Journal of Hepatology (2017). Low credibility.

Many patients have elevated serum aminotransferases reflecting various underlying conditions, both common and rare. Clinicians generally apply one of two evaluative strategies: testing for all diseases at once (extensive) or just common diseases first (focused).

- **Methods**: We simulated the evaluation of 10,000 adult outpatients with elevated alanine aminotransferase to compare both testing strategies. Model inputs employed population-based data from the US (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey) and Britain (Birmingham and Lambeth Liver Evaluation Testing Strategies). Patients were followed until a diagnosis was provided or a diagnostic liver biopsy was considered. The primary outcome was US dollars per diagnosis. Secondary outcomes included doctor visits per diagnosis, false-positives per diagnosis, and confirmatory liver biopsies ordered.

- **Results**: The extensive testing strategy required the lowest monetary cost, yielding diagnoses for 54% of patients at $448/patient compared to 53% for $502 under the focused strategy. The extensive strategy also required fewer doctor visits (1.35 vs. 1.61 visits/patient). However, the focused strategy generated fewer false-positives (0.1 vs. 0.19/patient) and more biopsies (0.04 vs. 0.08/patient). Focused testing becomes the most cost-effective strategy when accounting for pre-test probabilities and prior evaluations performed, including when the respective prevalence of alcoholic, non-alcoholic, and drug-induced liver disease exceeds 51.1%, 53.0%, and 13.0%.

### Epidiolex [^115k4dmG]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

In general, transaminase elevations of greater than three times the upper limit of normal (ULN) in the presence of elevated bilirubin without an alternative explanation are an important predictor of severe liver injury. Early identification of elevated liver enzymes may decrease the risk of a serious outcome. Patients with elevated baseline transaminase levels above three times the ULN, accompanied by elevations in bilirubin above two times the ULN, should be evaluated prior to initiation of Epidiolex treatment.

Prior to starting treatment with Epidiolex, obtain serum transaminases (ALT and AST) and total bilirubin levels. Serum transaminases and total bilirubin levels should be obtained at one month, three months, and six months after initiation of treatment with Epidiolex, and periodically thereafter or as clinically indicated. Serum transaminases and total bilirubin levels should also be obtained within one month following changes in Epidiolex dosage and addition of or changes in medications that are known to impact the liver. Consider more frequent monitoring of serum transaminases and bilirubin in patients who are taking valproate or who have elevated liver enzymes at baseline.

If a patient develops clinical signs or symptoms suggestive of hepatic dysfunction (e.g. unexplained nausea, vomiting, right upper quadrant abdominal pain, fatigue, anorexia, or jaundice and/or dark urine), promptly measure serum transaminases and total bilirubin and interrupt or discontinue treatment with Epidiolex, as appropriate. Discontinue Epidiolex in any patients with elevations of transaminase levels greater than three times the ULN in the presence of elevations in bilirubin.

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^113Fviv2]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) is produced mainly in the liver (from the biliary epithelium) but is also found in abundance in bone and in smaller quantities in the intestines, kidneys, and white blood cells. Levels are physiologically higher in childhood, associated with bone growth, and in pregnancy due to placental production. Pathologically increased levels occur mainly in bone disease, such as metastatic bone disease and bone fractures, and cholestatic liver disease, for example, primary biliary cholangitis, primary sclerosing cholangitis, common bile duct obstruction, intrahepatic duct obstruction (metastases), and drug-induced cholestasis. Furthermore, hepatic congestion secondary to right-sided heart failure can also lead to cholestasis, characterized by elevated ALP levels and/or bilirubin.

When ALP is elevated in isolation, the measurement of γ-glutamyltransferase can indicate whether the ALP is of hepatic or non-hepatic origin. While there are no data on the most likely causes of an isolated raised ALP in an asymptomatic population, the most common cause is likely to be vitamin D deficiency or a normal increase seen in childhood due to rapid growth. Other causes include Paget's disease and bony metastases. If doubt still exists, the use of electrophoresis to separate the isoenzymes of ALP can differentiate hepatic from non-hepatic causes of increased ALP.

AST and ALT are enzymes present in hepatocytes and are released into the bloodstream in response to hepatocyte injury or death (hepatitis). Elevations in either of these enzymes are the most common abnormality seen on liver blood tests.

### The association of higher levels of within-normal-limits liver enzymes and the prevalence of the metabolic syndrome [^1112hUfL]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2010). Low credibility.

The notion that persistently elevated liver enzyme concentrations, even within the so-called "reference" range, is associated with cardiovascular risk factors and future disease has been previously demonstrated. In fact, it has been shown that several liver enzymes, in particular GGT, are associated with the appearance of cardiovascular events. This is also relevant to individuals with the metabolic syndrome (MetS). Thus, the recognition that the prevalence of the MetS increases even in individuals whose liver enzymes are in the lower part of the 'normal' reference range might have clinical significance in terms of early recognition of these dysmetabolic changes.

We recognize several limitations in the analysis. First, our conclusions are of a descriptive nature and are based essentially only on associations between parameters. Based upon its cross-sectional design, the present findings are inherently limited in the ability to eliminate causal relationships. Second, since some of the study population had several risk factors, we could not fully eliminate the possible effect of underlying diseases and medications used for these diseases on the present findings. Further prospective population-based studies are needed to investigate the mechanisms in order to answer these questions. Finally, serum GGT is a sensitive indicator of alcohol consumption and/or liver dysfunction, such as fatty liver, and is also high in patients with liver disease: chronic viral hepatitis, primary biliary cirrhosis, or drug-induced liver injury. These liver diseases are present in community-dwelling persons.

### ACG clinical guideline: Evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^117MpALN]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Clinicians are required to assess abnormal liver chemistries on a daily basis. The most common liver chemistries ordered are serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin. These tests should be termed liver chemistries or liver tests. Hepatocellular injury is defined as a disproportionate elevation of AST and ALT levels compared with alkaline phosphatase levels. In contrast, cholestatic injury is defined as a disproportionate elevation of alkaline phosphatase level compared with AST and ALT levels.

The majority of bilirubin circulates as unconjugated bilirubin, and an elevated conjugated bilirubin implies hepatocellular disease or cholestasis. Multiple studies have demonstrated that the presence of an elevated ALT has been associated with increased liver-related mortality. A true healthy normal ALT level ranges from 29 to 33 IU/l for males and 19 to 25 IU/l for females; levels above this should be assessed. The degree of elevation of ALT and/or AST in the clinical setting helps guide the evaluation.

- **Evaluation of hepatocellular injury**: This includes testing for viral hepatitis A, B, and C, assessment for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and alcoholic liver disease, and screening for hereditary hemochromatosis, autoimmune hepatitis, Wilson's disease, and alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. Additionally, a history of prescribed and over-the-counter medicines should be sought.

- **Elevation of alkaline phosphatase**: For an alkaline phosphatase elevation determined to be of hepatic origin, testing for primary biliary cholangitis and primary sclerosing cholangitis should be considered.

### SPL drug information for atrasentan [^115QpAfR]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Regarding the use of atrasentan PO (also known as Vanrafia) in patients with acute or decompensated chronic liver disease:

- **Monitor liver function tests**: Regular monitoring is essential.
- **Discontinue atrasentan** if clinically relevant aminotransferase elevations occur or if elevations are accompanied by an increase in bilirubin > 2× upper limit of normal or by clinical symptoms of hepatotoxicity. Consider re-initiating atrasentan when hepatic enzyme levels normalize in patients who have not experienced clinical symptoms of hepatotoxicity or jaundice.

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^115wEbB4]. Gut (2018). High credibility.

What constitutes a standard liver blood test panel?

There are remarkably few data to determine what an optimal liver blood test panel should include, although this would be influenced by the clinical setting. The Health Technology Assessment commissioned Birmingham and Lambeth Liver Evaluation Testing Strategies (BALLETS) study reported that ALT and ALP identified the vast majority of adults with necro-inflammatory liver disease. The routine addition of GGT led to a marginal increase in sensitivity but at the cost of a loss of specificity and a higher false-positive rate. However, the analysis did not include adults with NAFLD or alcohol-related liver disease (ARLD), which account for 90% of liver mortality, in whom liver blood tests and the follow-on liver etiology screen are seldom diagnostic. In this setting, GGT and AST would aid the sensitivity of detecting such patients. The addition of GGT to a liver blood test panel increases the likelihood of an adult having abnormal liver blood tests from around 15% to 30%, and notably, a raised GGT is associated with increased liver as well as all-cause (including cancer) mortality, with the greatest risk being observed in those with the most significant elevations of GGT. In addition, the routine addition of AST to the initial panel did not improve the detection of specific disease.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for drug-induced liver injury, specifically in relation to liver function tests (LFTs), the EASL 2019 guidelines recommend using persistently elevated total bilirubin (TBIL) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) as markers for chronic drug-induced liver injury (DILI) in the second month from the onset of DILI.

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^117VSnab]. Gut (2018). High credibility.

The extent of abnormality in liver blood tests is a common concern. It is often assumed that the magnitude of derangement in a liver blood test panel correlates with prognosis. Therefore, threshold values above the upper limit of the reference interval are commonly used to direct the need for further investigation. However, this assumption is not supported by the literature. Prognosis is more accurately determined by the diagnosis and the context within which the tests are requested.

To illustrate, consider two patients: one with an acute hepatitis A infection may have ALT values greater than 1000 U/L, while another with hepatitis C may have ALT within the normal reference interval. Yet, ten years later, the patient with hepatitis A is likely to be alive and well, irrespective of management, whereas the patient with hepatitis C, if not diagnosed and investigated, is at substantial risk of progressing to end-stage liver disease. Indeed, the most common causes of abnormal liver blood tests leading to chronic liver disease — non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, alcohol-related liver disease, and hepatitis C — are frequently associated with only mild or moderate liver blood test abnormalities.

Therefore, despite the increasing use of liver blood tests, patients continue to present with undiagnosed end-stage liver disease, which might have been preventable by earlier diagnosis. Moreover, the upper limit of normal for many liver enzymes (for example, ALT) may be too high, likely because patients with occult NAFLD were included when generating normal serum ALT ranges.

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^117J7mYC]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

- **Recommendation 9**: Harmful drinkers should undergo risk stratification with clinical assessment and Fibroscan/ARFI elastography. Adults should be referred to secondary care if there is evidence of advanced liver disease, such as features of cirrhosis or portal hypertension on imaging or from blood tests, and/or Fibroscan reading is > 16 kPa (if available).

- **Patients flagged up with the AUDIT-C** should consider an assessment of liver fibrosis if drinking exceeds 100 U/L, similar to the higher-risk group.

- **Research recommendation 2**: Further evidence is required to establish the most cost-effective approach to identify patients with alcohol-related liver disease (ARLD) and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) at risk of having advanced liver fibrosis.
