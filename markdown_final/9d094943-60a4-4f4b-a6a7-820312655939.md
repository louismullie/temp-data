## Question

Stemi post orthopedic surgery

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about diagnosing and managing STEMI after orthopedic surgery. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about immediate recognition and confirmation of STEMI in the postoperative setting. Then, I should verify the pathophysiology and why this matters for urgency. Next, I will review guideline-directed medical therapy and how to adapt it to postoperative bleeding risk. After that, I need to weigh reperfusion strategy, balancing PCI versus CABG versus fibrinolysis in the context of recent surgery. Then, I should consider antithrombotic management, including DAPT timing and bridging. I will also examine special scenarios like recent PCI, cardiogenic shock, and LV thrombus. Finally, I will outline monitoring, surveillance, and secondary prevention, and close with a concise decision algorithm summary.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and not jump to conclusions, because postoperative patients often have atypical symptoms and sedation can mask ischemia; I need to check for new ST-segment elevation in at least two contiguous leads or a new LBBB, and I should double-check troponin dynamics with a rise and/or fall above the 99th percentile upper reference limit to distinguish myocardial injury from infarction using the Universal Definition of MI criteria, including symptoms, ischemic ECG changes, imaging evidence of new wall motion abnormality, or angiographic thrombus, while remembering that many perioperative MIs are type 2 from supply–demand mismatch rather than plaque rupture, which changes management priorities [^1142gzgN] [^115ZR6FY] [^116JmiJV].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about mechanism; I should verify whether this is type 1 MI with plaque rupture and thrombosis versus type 2 MI from anemia, hypotension, tachycardia, hypoxia, or pain, because perioperative STEMI after noncardiac surgery carries very high in-hospital mortality around 30–35% and most perioperative MIs are type 2, which means I must correct the precipitant while still delivering guideline-directed therapy when STEMI is confirmed [^115Fz3aF] [^116JmiJV].

> I need to ensure hemodynamic stability first; let me check ABCs, start oxygen if SpO2 is under 90%, obtain continuous ECG monitoring, establish reliable IV access, and draw labs including serial high-sensitivity troponins, CBC, renal function, and coagulation profile, while remembering that most MINS cases are asymptomatic and would be missed without routine troponin surveillance in high-risk patients, so I should maintain a high index of suspicion in orthopedic patients with risk factors [^111cqFtf] [^116Jmqif].

> Next, I should review guideline-directed medical therapy and adapt it to the postoperative context; I will give aspirin 150–325 mg immediately if not contraindicated, consider a P2Y12 inhibitor if bleeding risk is acceptable, and start a statin regardless of LDL, but I need to be cautious with beta-blockers and anticoagulation given postoperative hypotension and bleeding risk, so I will individualize and reassess frequently rather than apply a one-size-fits-all approach [^116uuK3C] [^115ZR6FY].

> Now, I will examine reperfusion strategy; primary PCI is the gold standard and should be pursued emergently if available, with door-to-balloon time under 90 minutes when feasible, but wait, I should verify surgical bleeding risk and coordinate with the orthopedic team because postoperative patients may have wound hematomas and prosthetic joint infection risk, so if PCI is not available within 120 minutes, fibrinolysis can be considered if surgical bleeding is not prohibitive, and if PCI fails or is not feasible and there is a large myocardium at risk, urgent or emergency CABG may be indicated after heart team discussion [^113CjF7p] [^115Fz3aF] [^112k3RQ3].

> Let me think about antithrombotic therapy and the DAPT dilemma; if the patient recently had PCI with DES, I should confirm timing because the risk of stent thrombosis is highest in the first 4–6 weeks and remains elevated to 6 months, so I need to balance continuing DAPT against surgical bleeding, and if DAPT must be interrupted, I should consider continuing aspirin and using IV cangrelor or a short-acting GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor as a bridge in selected high-thrombotic-risk patients, acknowledging that evidence for bridging is limited and decisions should be individualized by cardiology, surgery, and anesthesia [^117AF2u6] [^11397sbi] [^111XpipL].

> But wait, what if the patient is in cardiogenic shock or has mechanical complications; I should confirm that emergency revascularization is indicated irrespective of time delay, with PCI preferred if feasible and urgent CABG considered when PCI is not possible or unsuccessful, and I need to ensure management in a facility with cardiac surgical capability and mechanical support if needed [^114DEhJj] [^115o9Fqm] [^114rAgBi].

> I should also consider LV thrombus risk after anterior STEMI; if LVEF is under 30% or there is an apical aneurysm, I need to check for thrombus with echocardiography and consider cardiac MRI if suspicion remains high, and if thrombus is present, I should add anticoagulation for about 3 months with repeat imaging to guide duration, carefully balancing bleeding risk from recent orthopedic surgery [^1147QMLc].

> Next, I should review monitoring and surveillance; continuous telemetry is essential, serial troponins help define the rise and fall pattern, and I need to watch for arrhythmias, heart failure, and recurrent ischemia, while remembering that in high-risk orthopedic patients routine postoperative troponin surveillance on days 1–3 can detect otherwise silent MINS, which itself portends worse outcomes and warrants aggressive risk factor modification and follow-up [^111cqFtf] [^116Jmqif].

> I will now examine secondary prevention and long-term management; high-intensity statin therapy, ACE inhibitor or ARB if indicated, and risk-stratified beta-blocker use should be initiated when safe, and I should confirm DAPT duration based on stent type and bleeding risk, with consideration of shorter DAPT courses in patients at high bleeding risk and longer courses in those at high ischemic risk, all coordinated with the surgical team to protect the joint and wound [^113CjF7p] [^111w1N9U].

> Hold on, I should verify that multidisciplinary coordination is explicit; decisions about timing of surgery, interruption of antiplatelet therapy, and the choice of reperfusion strategy should be made in a team-based manner involving cardiology, orthopedic surgery, anesthesia, and critical care, with shared decision-making documented, especially when balancing competing risks of bleeding and ischemia [^115Fz3aF] [^112fqddF].

> Let me reconsider the timing of noncardiac surgery after recent MI or stenting because this affects risk counseling; elective surgery should generally be deferred at least 6–12 months after DES and ideally a full year after ACS, but if surgery is urgent, I should minimize DAPT interruption, continue aspirin when possible, and use bridging selectively, recognizing that risk of stent thrombosis is front-loaded in the first month and declines but persists to 6 months [^117AF2u6] [^116LfKye].

> Finally, I should double-check that my decision algorithm is coherent: confirm STEMI with ECG and troponin dynamics, stabilize and start GDMT adapted to bleeding risk, pursue emergent PCI when feasible with surgical input, consider fibrinolysis or urgent CABG if PCI is not available or fails and bleeding risk is acceptable, tailor antithrombotic therapy to stent timing and bleeding risk with bridging only when necessary, monitor closely for complications, and implement aggressive secondary prevention with structured follow-up, adjusting plans as the clinical picture evolves [^116uuK3C] [^115Fz3aF] [^115ZR6FY].

STEMI after orthopedic surgery is rare but high-risk, often silent, and strongly linked to mortality [^115Fz3aF] [^117B2JHr]. Immediate **ECG and hs-troponin** are essential for diagnosis, as symptoms are frequently masked by analgesia [^111cqFtf] [^1142gzgN]. Management follows standard STEMI care — aspirin, P2Y12 inhibitor, anticoagulation, and urgent reperfusion — but must be balanced against **postoperative bleeding risk** and the surgical site [^116uuK3C] [^116LReAL]. Primary PCI is preferred when feasible; fibrinolysis is generally avoided due to bleeding risk. Antiplatelet therapy should be individualized, and DAPT minimized if bleeding risk is high. Early cardiology involvement and multidisciplinary planning are critical to optimize outcomes [^115Fz3aF] [^116LReAL].

---

## Incidence and risk factors

Incidence is low but significant: **0.1–0.2%** after major orthopedic surgery, with higher risk in emergency settings [^114zJ5eX] [^116Jmqif]. Risk factors include age ≥ 65 years, male sex, diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, smoking, CKD, prior CAD/MI, and recent PCI; urgent/emergency surgery and procedures such as hip fracture repair, TKA/THA, and spine surgery also increase risk [^111ToS8k] [^116jyvjS] [^115ckN4J].

---

## Pathophysiology

Pathophysiology includes **type 1 MI** from plaque rupture/thrombosis triggered by perioperative stress, inflammation, and catecholamines, and **type 2 MI** from supply–demand mismatch due to anemia, hypotension, tachycardia, hypoxia, or pain [^116JmiJV] [^115Fz3aF].

---

## Clinical presentation

Presentation is often **atypical or silent** because postoperative analgesia masks ischemic symptoms; patients may present with dyspnea, confusion, hypotension, or arrhythmias rather than chest pain [^111cqFtf] [^117B2JHr].

---

## Diagnostic criteria and biomarkers

Diagnosis relies on **serial hs-troponin measurements** (rise/fall with ≥ 1 value > 99th percentile) plus ischemic symptoms, new ST-T changes, or imaging evidence of ischemia [^115ZR6FY]. ECG may show ST elevation, new LBBB, or posterior MI; posterior MI can present with ST depression in V1–V3 [^112hoKP7]. hs-troponin is highly sensitive for perioperative MI, including asymptomatic cases [^111cqFtf].

---

## Immediate management

### General principles

Immediate management centers on **early recognition** with prompt ECG and hs-troponin, hemodynamic stabilization, and urgent cardiology consultation [^111cqFtf] [^115Fz3aF]. Multidisciplinary coordination with surgery, anesthesia, and cardiology is essential to balance ischemic and bleeding risks [^115Fz3aF].

---

### Pharmacological management

- **Antiplatelet therapy**: Aspirin 150–325 mg loading dose unless contraindicated; P2Y12 inhibitor (clopidogrel preferred) if bleeding risk acceptable [^114uMZXu].
- **Anticoagulation**: Heparin or LMWH unless bleeding risk is high; adjust based on surgical site and timing [^115tg8Zj] [^1179bGbY].
- **Beta-blockers**: Use cautiously; avoid in hypotension or cardiogenic shock [^114uMZXu].
- **Statins**: Initiate or continue high-intensity statin unless contraindicated [^111GSE9U].

---

### Reperfusion strategies

Primary PCI is the **preferred reperfusion method** when available and feasible, balancing bleeding risk and surgical site [^116uuK3C] [^115Fz3aF]. Fibrinolysis is generally avoided due to bleeding risk; consider only if PCI is unavailable and bleeding risk is acceptable [^notfound]. CABG is reserved for failed PCI or complex multivessel disease with large ischemic burden [^117R4QoC].

---

## Perioperative considerations and complications

- **Bleeding risk**: Major concern due to antiplatelet/anticoagulant therapy; assess surgical site, hematoma, and transfusion needs [^113HD68j].
- **Wound complications**: Increased risk of infection and dehiscence with antiplatelet therapy [^notfound].
- **Anesthetic considerations**: Regional anesthesia may be contraindicated with anticoagulation; tailor plan to bleeding risk [^notfound].

---

## Prognosis and long-term outcomes

Mortality is high, with **30-day mortality ~10–15%** and 1-year mortality ~20–30% [^116Jmqif] [^113E7N7r]. Morbidity includes increased risk of recurrent MI, heart failure, arrhythmias, and reduced functional recovery [^notfound].

---

## Prevention strategies

- **Preoperative risk assessment**: Use RCRI, cardiac biomarkers, and clinical risk factors to stratify risk [^1142gzgN].
- **Medical optimization**: Control hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia; treat anemia; continue statins and beta-blockers when indicated [^111DqCbJ].
- **Perioperative monitoring**: Routine hs-troponin on postoperative days 1–3 in high-risk patients [^111GSE9U].
- **Antiplatelet management**: Continue aspirin perioperatively when feasible; minimize DAPT interruption [^116LfKye].

---

## Current guidelines and recommendations

Current guidance emphasizes **multidisciplinary care** with coordinated cardiology, surgery, and anesthesia input [^115Fz3aF]. Management should follow STEMI guidelines while individualizing antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy to bleeding risk [^116uuK3C]. Routine postoperative troponin surveillance is recommended in high-risk patients [^111cqFtf].

---

STEMI after orthopedic surgery is a rare but high-mortality event; **prompt recognition**, guideline-directed therapy, and multidisciplinary management are essential to balance ischemic and bleeding risks and improve outcomes.

The primary management strategy for the post-myocardial infarction patient continues to be controversial despite published guidelines. In part, this is the consequence of study designs that are not directly applicable to individual patients, but also to the rapidly changing pharmacological and mechanical device armamentarium that rapidly renders clinical trial results obsolete within a few years. This review attempts to highlight those areas where there is consensus as well as to explicate those situations where common clinical practice appears to be in conflict with accepted guidelines.

### Management of a complex acetabular fracture following defibrillation for ventricular fibrillation cardiac arrest [^115Uwrej]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). High credibility.

Background

Primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with implantation of a drug-eluting stent is the gold-standard treatment for ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). Following this, patients are routinely treated with 12 months of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT), unless there is a bleeding contraindication. In patients who require non-cardiac surgery while on DAPT, several considerations need to be balanced to manage risks to patients and overall outcomes.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2024). High credibility.

Perioperative STEMI after noncardiac surgery — urgent management: Perioperative STEMI due to acute plaque rupture occurs in a minority of patients with perioperative MI but is associated with in-hospital mortality of 30% to 35%. GDMT for perioperative STEMI should be promptly initiated, balancing postoperative risks such as bleeding and hypotension; emergent ICA should be strongly considered, weighing bleeding and thrombotic risks with the severity of clinical presentation, and management decisions should be made in a team-based manner involving the surgeon, anesthesiologist, and cardiologist.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2024). High credibility.

Perioperative myocardial infarction (MI) after noncardiac surgery — epidemiology and diagnostic/management considerations: The incidence of perioperative MI ranges widely from 0.90% to 15% depending on the definitions, patient risk factors, and surgical type. Patients with perioperative STEMI and NSTEMI have a substantial mortality risk, with nearly one-third of patients either dying or being readmitted at 30 days, and they are more likely to present with type 2 MI due to supply–demand mismatch than type 1 MI. Recognition can be difficult because sedation and analgesia can limit symptom reporting; in suspected type 2 MI, management should address the underlying supply–demand mismatch, and nonischemic causes of troponin elevation should be considered. ICA may be indicated when acute coronary occlusion is suspected after individualized risk stratification that accounts for residual bleeding risk, type of surgery, and time since surgery.

RESULTS

Our retrospective chart review identified 548 patients who met the inclusion and exclusion criteria for the study. A total of 211 patients were noted to have a troponin elevation, while 337 patients did not have a troponin elevation. As seen in Table 1, the most common surgical procedures for all patients were general (24%), orthopedic (22%), and vascular (18%). ECGs were obtained in > 97% of the patients with troponin elevation. Less than 2% of patients had ST elevation, ≈30% of patients had ST segment or T‐wave changes consistent with ischemia, and ≈65% of the patients did not have ischemic changes (Table S1). While cardiology service was consulted for a majority of these patients, only 11% (n = 24) were thought to need coronary angiography, of which only a total of 8 patients required coronary revascularization (Table S2).

Table 1
Baseline Patient Characteristics and the Distribution of Surgery Types Within the Total Population in the Study

Table 1 shows the baseline characteristics of the patients within the population in this study. Our study population had fair representation of female patients, about three‐fourths had hypertension, about one‐half were smokers or had hyperlipidemia, but only one‐third of the patients had diabetes mellitus or known coronary artery disease. The majority of patients did not have chronic kidney disease. The overall all‐cause mortality at 1 year in this study population was 16%.

Table 2 shows the characteristics of these patients when the total population is subdivided into patients with and without postoperative troponin elevation. Between the 2 groups, there is a comparable proportion of female patients and patients with coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular accident, diabetes mellitus, and chronic kidney disease. The positive troponin group had fewer patients with hypertension (12.6%), hyperlipidemia (19.3%), and smokers (9%). The positive troponin group had a higher proportion of patients with a known history of peripheral vascular disease (10.8%) and a significantly high 1‐year mortality (20.24%) compared with the group of patients without postoperative troponin elevation. This significant difference (OR, 3.9; 95% CI, 2.44–6.33) in long‐term mortality between patients with and without postoperative troponin elevation is seen early (within the first 3–6 months) in Figure with a persistent separation of the survival curves.

### Myocardial infarction prior to TKA is associated with increased risk of medical and surgical complications in a time-dependent manner [^115ckN4J]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

There has been minimal literature evaluating how a prior myocardial infraction (MI) influences outcomes after total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Thus, the purpose of this study was to evaluate how the timing, type, and treatment of MI prior to TKA affect postoperative cardiac complications, general medical complications, and surgical complications.

Methods

A retrospective comparative study was conducted using a large insurance database. Patients undergoing primary TKA for osteoarthritis were included. Patients who had experienced MI within 2 years before TKA were identified and were matched 1:4 with patients who had not had such an MI on the basis of demographic variables and comorbidities. Patients who had a prior MI were stratified into 4 groups based on the timing of the MI: 0 to < 6 months, 6 to < 12 months, 12 to < 18 months, and 18 to 24 months before TKA. The rates of postoperative cardiac, general medical, and surgical complications were compared between groups. Subanalyses on the prior MI type, treatment, and location were performed.

Results

Prior MI was associated with increased risks of postoperative MI (odds ratio [OR], 3.97 [95% confidence interval (CI), 3.20 to 4.93]), heart failure (OR, 1.45 [95% CI, 1.24 to 1.75]), and 90-day mortality (OR, 2.15 [95% CI, 1.41 to 3.28]). The risk of postoperative MI was highest for those with MI within 6 months before TKA (OR, 6.86 [95% CI, 5.34 to 8.82]). Type-1 MI, ST-elevation MI (STEMI), non-ST-elevation MI (NSTEMI), and anterior and inferior MIs were linked to elevated postoperative MI and/or mortality risks, with timing closer to surgery further amplifying the risk. Percutaneous coronary intervention within 6 months before TKA also increased postoperative risks. Type-2 MI within 6 months before TKA was associated with an increased risk of periprosthetic joint infection compared with controls (OR, 4.23 [95% CI, 1.67 to 10.67]).

Conclusions

Patients who had a prior MI, particularly within 6 months before TKA, had significantly elevated risks of postoperative MI, heart failure, and mortality. Outcomes varied by MI type, treatment, and location, with type-1 MIs and STEMIs increasing the postoperative mortality risk.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2024). High credibility.

Evaluation of an Abnormal Troponin Obtained for Postoperative Surveillance — this algorithm starts with "Troponin > 99th percentile URL" and then distinguishes myocardial infarction (MI) from injury using the Universal Definition of MI. The decision node asks "Has at least 1 criterion for Universal Definition of MI been met?" with criteria including "Symptoms of acute myocardial ischemia", "New ischemic ECG changes", "Development of pathologic Q waves", "Imaging evidence of new loss of viable myocardium or new regional wall motion abnormality", and "Identification of a coronary thrombus by angiography including intracoronary imaging". If MI criteria are not met, it asks "Is the myocardial injury likely due to a nonischemic process?" and specifies that "Nonsischemic myocardial injury encompasses pulmonary embolism, sepsis, acute decompensated heart failure, or acute stroke"; if not nonischemic, classify as myocardial injury after noncardiac surgery (MINS), for which "Discussion and recognition of MINS diagnosis, including outpatient referral, is reasonable (2a)". If MI criteria are met, manage as NSTEMI or STEMI. For NSTEMI, "Patients who develop NSTEMI after NCS should receive GDMT as recommended for patients with spontaneous MI, with limitations imposed by bleeding risk and postoperative hemodynamic status (1)" and "Patients who develop NSTEMI after NCS can benefit from invasive coronary angiography after weighing bleeding and thrombotic risks based on the severity of clinical presentation (2a)"; when plaque rupture is not suspected (Type 2 NSTEMI), "Treat underlying cause of supply-demand mismatch and optimize GDMT with limitations imposed by bleeding risk and postoperative hemodynamic status". For STEMI, "Patients who develop STEMI after NCS should receive GDMT including consideration of invasive coronary angiography, balancing bleeding and thrombotic risks with severity of the clinical presentation (1)". The figure notes that evaluation "Presumes a rise and fall of troponin consistent with acute myocardial injury. Troponin may be measured using a conventional fourth-generation or a high-sensitivity assay".

### 2024 AHA / ACC / ACS / ASNC / HRS / SCA / SCCT / SCMR / SVM guideline for perioperative cardiovascular management for noncardiac surgery: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^117AF2u6]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2024). High credibility.

Synopsis — perioperative risk windows and postponement guidance: The risk of perioperative stent thrombosis is greatest in the first 4 to 6 weeks post-PCI, with excess risks that decline over time but persist to 6 months. For most patients with CCD, DAPT is recommended for 6 months, followed by single antiplatelet therapy (either with aspirin or P2Y12 inhibitor). Selected patients may be eligible for shorter durations of DAPT (28–31 days or 90 days) post-PCI based on recent data. Patients with PCI performed for MI have nearly 3-fold higher risks of postoperative MACE versus those with CCD as the indication for PCI. Ideally, NCS should be postponed ≥ 1 year after PCI for ACS, although NCS can be considered ≥ 6 months after DES placement for CCD and after 3 months for time-sensitive NCS if the benefits of surgery outweigh the risk of MACE. If a patient requires urgent NCS requiring interruption of DAPT, balloon angioplasty without stent may be considered, with NCS delayed for a minimum of 14 days due to higher perioperative MACE risk very early after PCI.

### Comprehensive review of myocardial injury after noncardiac surgery: prevention, intervention, and long-term management strategies [^114otiuH]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Each tool has its advantages and disadvantages when identifying cardiac complications postoperatively. When utilizing a risk assessment tool, there is variability in patient risk due to various populations and various study parameters. For risk assessment tools to be useful, these calculations must identify higher-risk patients who will benefit from pre-operative cardiac optimization which may call for the use of numerous risk assessment types. However, it is imperative to understand the limitations of each risk assessment calculator used in MINS to address accuracy concerns and the potential overestimation or underestimation of risk in certain populations. Overall, each preoperative patient must have a personalized care plan that takes into account medical history, lifestyle choices, comorbidities, and risk factors when utilizing risk assessments to provide more accurate predictions and recommendations for patient care.

### Perioperative management of the patient with cardiac disease [^1121D9Aj]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2010). Low credibility.

The overall incidence of perioperative death is relatively low. However, patients with coronary artery disease are at higher than average risk of perioperative cardiac complications. Thus, preoperative testing for cardiac disease should be done in certain patients in an effort to reduce postoperative mortality and morbidity. Patients who require emergent orthopaedic surgery are at greater risk of perioperative cardiac events than are those who undergo elective procedures. Certain modalities, such as beta blockers, statins, and alpha-2 agonists, may be started or continued in the postoperative period to further enhance cardiac function. We review the current recommendations for preoperative cardiac testing in orthopaedic patients and for perioperative management of orthopaedic patients with known cardiac disease.

### Pre-operative risk assessment and risk reduction before surgery [^111DqCbJ]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2008). Low credibility.

Perioperative myocardial infarctions are the predominant cause of morbidity and mortality in patients undergoing noncardiac surgery. The pathophysiology of perioperative myocardial infarction is complex. Prolonged myocardial ischemia due to the stress of surgery in the presence of a hemodynamically significant coronary lesion, leading to subendocardial ischemia, and acute coronary artery occlusion after plaque rupture and thrombus formation contribute equally to these devastating events. Perioperative management aims at optimizing the patient's condition by identification and modification of underlying cardiac risk factors and diseases. During recent decades there has been a shift from the assessment and treatment of the underlying culprit coronary lesion toward a systemic medical therapy aiming at prevention of myocardial oxygen supply demand mismatch and coronary plaque stabilization. Beta-blockers, statins, and aspirin are widely used in this setting. The role of prophylactic coronary revascularization has been restricted to the same indications as the nonoperative setting. Therefore pre-operative cardiac testing is recommended only if test results will change perioperative management. In addition to the limited perioperative period, physicians should benefit from this opportunity to initiate lifestyle changes and medical therapy to lessen the impact of cardiac risk factors, as patients should live long enough after the operation to enjoy the benefits of surgery.

### Risk of post-TKA acute myocardial infarction in patients with a history of myocardial infarction or coronary stent [^116jyvjS]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is one of the most important perioperative complications of total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Although risk-stratification tools exist for the prediction of cardiac complications including AMI after noncardiac surgery, such stratification does not differentiate the patients with a coronary stent alone, AMI without a stent, or AMI with a stent. The risk of postoperative AMI in these patient groups may vary. Several studies have recommended suitable times for noncardiac surgery in patients with a coronary stent; however, they do not differentiate between the patients with AMI and no AMI. The suitable time of noncardiac surgery for patients with AMI and stent may vary from those with a stent alone. Moreover, a study to evaluate the risk of AMI within 1 year in an Asian population with a history of AMI or coronary stent who underwent TKA has not been reported.

Questions/Purposes

(1) What are the risks of AMI within 1 year of TKA in patients who have had a stent alone, AMI without a stent, or AMI with a stent as compared with patients without an AMI/stent? (2) For patients with AMI/stent placement, when can TKA be performed where the risk of subsequent AMI normalizes? (3) What comorbidities are associated with post-TKA AMI? (4) Is the risk of AMI within 1 year after surgery in patients undergoing TKA without a history of AMI/stent higher than that in patients with no surgery?

Methods

This study is a retrospective study of the medical claim records of 128,216 patients who underwent TKA between 1997 and 2010 in Taiwan. The records were retrieved from the research database of the Bureau of National Health Insurance in Taiwan, which maintains the records of 99.68% of the Taiwan population. The patients who had a history of AMI or coronary stent placement within the year before TKA were compared with the patients who had not experienced AMI or stent placement before TKA. The control subjects were matched according to sex, age, Charlson score, and year of surgery. There were 2413 patients in each group. The patients with a history of AMI or stent placement and the timing of TKA after coronary event were further stratified as with a coronary stent alone, AMI without a stent, and AMI with a stent. The effects of the comorbidities of renal failure, diabetes, liver failure, and hypertension were also analyzed individually. The risk of AMI within 1 year after TKA was investigated using bivariate analysis and the Cox proportional hazard model. To compare the risk of AMI within 1 year of surgery in the patients with a history of TKA and no AMI/stent with the population without a history of surgery, a similar bivariate analysis and the Cox proportional hazard model were applied to their matched case and control groups, each containing 110,980 patients.

Results

In the adjusted model, using no AMI/stent before TKA as a reference, patients having undergone AMI + stent had the highest risk (hazard ratio [HR], 5.23; 95% confidence interval, 1.81–15.14; p = 0.002), AMI alone without a stent had less risk (HR, 4.88; 95% CI, 1.49–16.01; p = 0.009), and stent alone with AMI had the lowest risk (HR, 3.16; 95% CI, 1.29–7.71; p = 0.012). In all patients, risk of AMI after TKA was not different than reference values after 1 year of initial AMI or stent (stent: HR, 1.67; 95% CI, 0.71–3.94; p = 0.239; AMI: HR, 1.88; 95% CI, 0.42–8.49; p = 0.412; AMI + stent: HR, 1.91; 95% CI, 0.53–6.89; p = 0.321). The risk of post-TKA AMI was elevated within 1 year of the previous episode of AMI/stent (0–180 days: HR, 8.42; 95% CI, 3.03–23.41; p < 0.001; 181–365 days: HR, 7.52; 95% CI, 2.47–22.88; p < 0.001). Only chronic renal failure under hemodialysis was associated with increased risk of AMI within 1 year of TKA (adjusted HR, 4.34; 95% CI, 1.22–15.43; p = 0.023). Patients undergoing TKA with no history of AMI/stent had a lower risk of AMI within 1 year of TKA compared with the patients with no history of surgery (adjusted HR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.86–0.99; p = 0.016).

Conclusions

This study found the risk of post-TKA AMI remains high within 1 year in patients with a history of AMI/stent. It is recommended that an elective TKA should be performed at least 1 year after an episode of AMI or stent placement. Stents do not provide protection against post-TKA AMI within 6 months of the AMI and patients with AMI + stent have a higher risk of AMI than those with only AMI. Patients of AMI/stent on hemodialysis have a very high risk of post-TKA AMI. However, the risk of AMI is lower in post-TKA patients compared with those with no TKA.

### Myocardial infarction risk in arthroplasty vs arthroscopy: how much does procedure type matter? [^114zJ5eX]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2017). Low credibility.

Background

This study aimed at assessing short-term risk of serious cardiac events after elective total joint arthroplasty (TJA) as compared to a less-invasive procedure, knee arthroscopy (KA).

Methods

Patients who underwent elective primary total hip arthroplasty (THA), total knee arthroplasty (TKA), or KA from 2011 to 2014 were identified in the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database. A 1:1 propensity matching was used to generate 2 control cohorts of KA patients with similar characteristics. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were assessed using perioperative variables.

Results

A total of 24,203 THA, 21,740 TKA, and 45,943 KA patients were included. Bivariate analysis revealed significantly higher rates of serious 30-day cardiac events (myocardial infarction or cardiac arrest) among THA (0.15% vs 0.05%, P < .001) and TKA patients (0.14% vs 0.05%, P < .03) vs KA controls. In multivariate analysis controlling for patient characteristics and comorbidities, THA and TKA were associated with a 2.61 and 1.98 times odds of serious 30-day cardiac events as compared to controls (P ≤ .03 for both). Additional independent predictors of serious 30-day cardiac events included age, smoking, cardiac disease, and American Society of Anesthesiologists class 3/4. In the THA and TKA cohorts, serious cardiac events occurred within the first 3 days postoperation compared to 4 days in controls.

Conclusion

After controlling for patient characteristics and comorbidities, TJA increased the short-term risk of serious cardiac event compared to a less-invasive procedure. This information better quantifies the risk differential for patients considering surgery as they engage in shared decision making with their providers. In addition, our data may have an impact on perioperative management of antithrombotic medications used in patients with cardiac disease. The median time in days to serious cardiac event was 2 in THA and 3 in TKA vs 4 in KA, which may have implications in postoperative monitoring of patients after surgery.

### Fourth universal definition of myocardial infarction (2018) [^1142gzgN]. European Heart Journal (2019). High credibility.

Myocardial injury and infarction associated with noncardiac procedures — perioperative myocardial infarction (MI) is one of the most important complications in major noncardiac surgery and is associated with a poor prognosis; most patients will not experience ischemic symptoms, yet asymptomatic perioperative MI is as strongly associated with 30 day mortality as symptomatic MI, and knowledge about baseline high-sensitivity cardiac troponin (hs-cTn) values can help to identify chronic elevation before surgery and increased risk during and after the procedure.

### Late medical versus interventional therapy for stable ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction [^115JA8vg]. Nature Clinical Practice: Cardiovascular Medicine (2008). Medium credibility.

ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is associated with high morbidity and mortality, but timely reperfusion is known to result in dramatically improved patient outcomes. As many as 40% of patients with STEMI, however, present late after symptom onset, which reduces the likelihood of them receiving reperfusion therapy. The past two decades have been plagued with controversy regarding the relative benefits of reperfusion therapy after 12 h from symptom onset. Despite considerable data supporting late reperfusion and the 'late open-artery hypothesis', recent studies have demonstrated a lack of benefit with late reperfusion. Moreover, advances in the medical management of STEMI have dramatically reduced morbidity and mortality, further challenging the need for more-invasive techniques. Numerous questions have arisen regarding the appropriate management and risk stratification of asymptomatic post-STEMI patients who present late after symptom onset. In light of recent data, we present a Review of late reperfusion in STEMI, specifically highlighting the effects of current medical therapies, risk-stratification techniques, and indications for the use of late reperfusion over medical management.

### Navigating cardiovascular events in non-cardiac surgery: a comprehensive review of complications and risk assessment strategies [^111B7HyX]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2025). Medium credibility.

Cardiovascular complications following non-cardiac surgery pose a significant global concern, affecting millions of patients annually. These complications, ranging from asymptomatic troponin elevations to major adverse cardiac events, contribute to heightened morbidity, mortality, and health care expenditures. The underlying mechanisms involve oxygen supply-demand imbalances and acute coronary syndromes precipitated by perioperative stressors. High-risk surgeries, including vascular and major abdominal procedures, are particularly susceptible to these complications. Risk assessment tools and biomarkers, especially high-sensitivity cardiac troponins, play pivotal roles in prognostication. However, despite advances in perioperative care, optimal management strategies remain elusive, as underscored by conflicting guidelines regarding interventions such as β-blockers and statins. This review aims to consolidate current evidence on cardiovascular complications following non-cardiac surgery, evaluate the utility of biomarkers, and discuss international guidelines for risk mitigation. An enhanced understanding regarding the standardized approaches is imperative in mitigating these complications effectively. Further research is essential to refine risk prediction models, validate biomarker thresholds, and elucidate the efficacy of preventive measures. Addressing these challenges can eventually lead to improved patient outcomes and more efficient healthcare resource utilization worldwide.

### Management of perioperative myocardial infarction in noncardiac surgical patients [^117F5RGn]. Chest (2006). Low credibility.

Perioperative myocardial infarction (PMI) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients undergoing noncardiac surgery. The incidence of PMI varies depending on the method used for diagnosis and is likely to increase as the population ages. Studies have examined different methods for prevention of myocardial infarction (MI), including the use of perioperative beta-blockers, alpha(2)-agonists, and statin therapy. However, few studies have focused on the treatment of PMI. Current therapy for acute MI generally involves anticoagulation and antiplatelet therapy, raising the potential for surgical site hemorrhage in this population. This article reviews the possible mechanisms, diagnosis, and treatment options for MI in the surgical setting. We also suggest algorithms for treatment.

### Comprehensive review of myocardial injury after noncardiac surgery: prevention, intervention, and long-term management strategies [^115sqhk4]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Myocardial Injury after Noncardiac Surgery (MINS) is an increasingly recognized complication that significantly impacts postoperative morbidity and mortality. Characterized by elevated cardiac troponin levels without overt ischemic symptoms, MINS presents a challenge in perioperative care. This review article explores the epidemiology, etiology, and management of MINS, with a particular focus on prevention and the latest management strategies. We discuss the role of aspirin, statins, anticoagulation, and Dual Antiplatelet Therapy (DAPT) within the context of MINS, drawing on evidence from notable clinical trials as well as observational studies. Despite advancements in understanding and managing MINS, the condition continues to be associated with high mortality and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), underscoring the need for ongoing research and development of more effective management protocols.

### Myocardial injury after non-cardiac surgery: diagnosis and management [^111GSE9U]. European Heart Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Myocardial injury after non-cardiac surgery (MINS) is due to myocardial ischaemia (i.e. supply-demand mismatch or thrombus) and is associated with an increased risk of mortality and major vascular complications at 30 days and up to 2years after non-cardiac surgery. The diagnostic criteria for MINS includes an elevated post-operative troponin measurement judged as resulting from myocardial ischaemia (i.e. no evidence of a non-ischaemic aetiology), during or within 30days after non-cardiac surgery, and without the requirement of an ischaemic feature (e.g. ischaemic symptom, ischaemic electrocardiography finding). For patients with MINS who are not at high risk of bleeding, physicians should consider initiating dabigatran 110mg twice daily and low-dose aspirin. Physicians should also consider initiating statin therapy in patients with MINS. Most MINS patients should only be referred to cardiac catheterization if they demonstrate recurrent instability (e.g. cardiac ischaemia, heart failure). Patients ≥ 65years of age or with known atherosclerotic disease should have troponin measurements on days 1, 2, and 3 after surgery while the patient is in hospital to avoid missing > 90% of MINS and the opportunity to initiate secondary prophylactic measures and follow-up.

Managing the patient with peri-operative myocardial injury and type 5 myocardial infarction

There is limited evidence from clinical studies comparing strategies on how best to manage either prognostically significant PMI or Type 5 MI following CABG surgery. The key issue in the immediate post-operative period is to identify patients with regional ischaemia due to graft-failure or an acute coronary event in the native coronaries, as this group of patients may benefit from urgent revascularisation. Graft failure post-CABG surgery is associated with higher mortality (∼15%), and is potentially amenable to intervention (PCI or redo-CABG). Early intervention in these patients may reduce the extent of Type 5 MI, thereby improving clinical outcomes. For non-graft-related PMI, there is currently no specific therapy available, only general supportive measures.

General management of peri-operative myocardial injury and type 5 myocardial infarction

General supportive measures apply both to graft-related as well as non-graft-related PMI and Type 5 MI. It is important to note that while there are several risk-stratification models to determine the risk of mortality in the patients undergoing CABG surgery based on pre-operative risk factors, such as EuroSCORE, EuroSCORE II, and STS score, there are currently no validated prediction models to determine which patients are at high-risk of PMI or Type 5 MI following CABG surgery. If patients at high risk of PMI or Type 5 MI can be identified, customised management pathways comprising more aggressive monitoring, investigations and/or treatment approaches may result in improved clinical outcomes. The ultimate treatment would be urgent coronary revascularisation, either interventional or surgical.

### Cardiac injury and troponin testing after orthopaedic surgery [^117B2JHr]. Injury (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Cardiac injury after orthopaedic surgery is an increasing problem particularly in an ageing population. The detection of cardiac injury has been aided by the use of cardiac troponins which has also raised questions about the utility of this enzyme in the post-operative setting.

Objective

This review evaluates the diagnosis and pathophysiology of myocardial infarction after orthopaedic surgery and examines how myocardial injury is detected, with particular emphasis on the role of troponin testing.

Subjects

Eight recent orthopaedic trials evaluating the use of troponin were identified in the literature and included in this review.

Results

This review found that the diagnosis of myocardial infarction ismore difficult after surgery since classic symptoms may be atypical or absent. Therefore, there ismore reliance on the typical rise and fall in troponin to diagnose cardiac injury especially because electrocardiograph changes may be hard to detect. The pathophysiology of ischaemia after orthopaedic surgery may be different to ischaemia in the non-surgical setting. The incidence of troponin elevation is between 22 and 52.9% after emergency orthopaedic operations. Of note, patients sustaining a troponin elevation are often asymptomatic. Small studies have found troponin to be a prognostic marker of in-hospital cardiac complications, increased length of stay, increased likelihood of discharge to residential care and death at 1 year. No interventional studies have been published to date.

Conclusion

Cardiac injury is an important complication after orthopaedic surgery. Studies have found that troponin testing can detect asymptomatic cardiac injury. These patients are at risk of poorer outcomes and future research should be directed towards treatment of these patients.

### Use of antiplatelet therapy / DAPT for Post-PCI patients undergoing noncardiac surgery [^112fmPAR]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) is prescribed to millions of patients worldwide following coronary stenting. DAPT is indicated to lower the risk of ischemic events, such as myocardial infarction, including stent thrombosis, ischemic stroke, or death from cardiovascular causes. A significant number of these patients undergo noncardiac surgery and may require DAPT interruption. This poses a significant clinical dilemma because DAPT interruption exposes patients to the potential risk of stent thrombosis, perioperative myocardial infarction, or both. Conversely, continuing DAPT may be associated with excess bleeding complications. Observational data in this area are conflicting, and there are no randomized clinical trials to guide practitioner decision making. On the basis of predominantly consensus recommendations, various strategies for managing DAPT during the perioperative period have been proposed. This review presents 3 commonly encountered clinical scenarios that lead into an evidence-based discussion of practical strategies for managing perioperative antiplatelet therapy in patients following percutaneous coronary intervention.

### Diagnosis and management of patients with myocardial injury after noncardiac surgery: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^111cqFtf]. Circulation (2021). Medium credibility.

Myocardial injury after noncardiac surgery is defined by elevated postoperative cardiac troponin concentrations that exceed the 99th percentile of the upper reference limit of the assay and are attributable to a presumed ischemic mechanism, with or without concomitant symptoms or signs. Myocardial injury after noncardiac surgery occurs in ≈20% of patients who have major inpatient surgery, and most are asymptomatic. Myocardial injury after noncardiac surgery is independently and strongly associated with both short-term and long-term mortality, even in the absence of clinical symptoms, electrocardiographic changes, or imaging evidence of myocardial ischemia consistent with myocardial infarction. Consequently, surveillance of myocardial injury after noncardiac surgery is warranted in patients at high risk for perioperative cardiovascular complications. This scientific statement provides diagnostic criteria and reviews the epidemiology, pathophysiology, and prognosis of myocardial injury after noncardiac surgery. This scientific statement also presents surveillance strategies and treatment approaches.

Evidence gaps — initial evaluation and management: Although the 2025 ACS guideline recognizes the value of risk scores in estimating the risk of death or recurrent MI, limited prospective randomized data are available as to whether risk scores should be used to determine treatment strategies. The highest risk patients are those who present after a cardiac arrest, and although the data support an invasive approach in resuscitated patients with ST-segment elevation on the postarrest ECG, any potential benefit of coronary angiography may be attenuated in those who are comatose. It is also less clear whether reperfusion with either fibrinolysis or primary PCI provides clinical benefit in ST-segment elevation patients who present late after symptom onset (12 to 48 hours) but who are no longer symptomatic.

The American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association, in collaboration with the Canadian Cardiovascular Society, have issued an update of the 2004 guideline for the management of patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. The American Academy of Family Physicians endorses and accepts this guideline as its policy. Early recognition and prompt initiation of reperfusion therapy remains the cornerstone of management of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. Aspirin should be given to symptomatic patients. Beta blockers should be used cautiously in the acute setting because they may increase the risk of cardiogenic shock and death. The combination of clopidogrel and aspirin is indicated in patients who have had ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. A stepped care approach to analgesia for musculoskeletal pain in patients with coronary heart disease is provided. Cyclooxygenase inhibitors and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs increase mortality risk and should be avoided. Primary prevention is important to reduce the burden of heart disease. Secondary prevention interventions are critically important to prevent recurrent events in patients who survive.

### Rehospitalizations following primary percutaneous coronary intervention in patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction: results from a multi-center randomized trial [^113Np6ve]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Rehospitalizations (RHs) after myocardial infarction (MI) are the aftermath of in‐hospital quality of care, postdischarge management, and an individual's vulnerability. 1, 2 Up to one fifth of patients who survive to hospital discharge will be readmitted within 1 month, 3, 4 with the consequent economic burden as well as impact on quality of life and long‐term prognosis. Identifying the characteristics associated with RHs could aid in stratifying patients according to their risk of RHs and assist physicians in optimizing management following discharge. 5

Although extensive data have been published regarding RHs after acute MI, 5 RHs after primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in patients presenting with ST‐segment elevation MI (STEMI) have not been systematically studied, and available data are limited to 30 days of follow‐up. 2, 4 Moreover, predictors of RHs have not been consistent throughout studies, which is partially explained by the diverse types of RHs reported (eg, all cause, cardiac related), as well as the quality and granularity of data expected based on the study design. 5 In addition, regional differences in the frequency emerged in multinational studies, underscoring the impact of health systems and local practices on RHs. 2

Planned RHs post‐PCI for STEMI may reflect good clinical practice, given that they relate to clinical decisions to better diagnose or treat patients. Such decisions could occur before (eg, hip replacement), during (eg, staged PCI), or after (eg, implantation of a cardioverter defibrillator) the index hospitalization. Consequently, examining unplanned RHs may better characterize patients at increased risk. Our aim was to investigate the frequency, reasons, and predictors of unplanned cardiac and noncardiac RHs following primary PCI in STEMI patients.

### Relation of perioperative elevation of troponin to long-term mortality after orthopedic surgery [^111RvXXB]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

Myocardial necrosis in the perioperative period of noncardiac surgery is associated with short-term mortality, but long-term outcomes have not been characterized. We investigated the association between perioperative troponin elevation and long-term mortality in a retrospective study of consecutive subjects who underwent hip, knee, and spine surgery. Perioperative myocardial necrosis and International Classification of Disease, Ninth Revision-coded myocardial infarction (MI) were recorded. Long-term survival was assessed using the Social Security Death Index database. Logistic regression models were used to identify independent predictors of long-term mortality. A total of 3,050 subjects underwent surgery. Mean age was 60.8 years, and 59% were women. Postoperative troponin was measured in 1,055 subjects (34.6%). Myocardial necrosis occurred in 179 cases (5.9%), and MI was coded in 20 (0.7%). Over 9,015 patient-years of follow-up, 111 deaths (3.6%) occurred. Long-term mortality was 16.8% in subjects with myocardial necrosis and 5.8% with a troponin in the normal range. Perioperative troponin elevation (hazard ratio 2.33, 95% confidence interval 1.33 to 4.10) and coded postoperative MI (adjusted hazard ratio 3.51, 95% confidence interval 1.44 to 8.53) were significantly associated with long-term mortality after multivariable adjustment. After excluding patients with coronary artery disease and renal dysfunction, myocardial necrosis remained associated with long-term mortality. In conclusion, postoperative myocardial necrosis is common after orthopedic surgery. Myocardial necrosis is independently associated with long-term mortality at 3 years and may be used to identify patients at higher risk for events who may benefit from aggressive management of cardiovascular risk factors.

### Association between myocardial injury and cardiovascular outcomes of orthopaedic surgery: a vascular events in noncardiac surgery patients cohort evaluation (VISION) substudy [^116Jmqif]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Myocardial injury after noncardiac surgery (MINS) is common and of prognostic importance. Little is known about MINS in orthopaedic surgery. The diagnostic criterion for MINS was a level of ≥ 0.03 ng/mL on a non-high-sensitivity troponin T (TnT) assay due to myocardial ischemia.

Methods

We undertook an international, prospective study of 15,103 patients ≥ 45 years of age who had inpatient noncardiac surgery; 3,092 underwent orthopaedic surgery. Non-high-sensitivity TnT assays were performed on postoperative days 0, 1, 2, and 3. Among orthopaedic patients, we determined (1) the prognostic relevance of the MINS diagnostic criteria, (2) the 30-day mortality rate for those with and without MINS, and (3) the probable proportion of MINS cases that would go undetected without troponin monitoring because of a lack of an ischemic symptom.

Results

Three hundred and sixty-seven orthopaedic patients (11.9%) had MINS. MINS was associated independently with 30-day mortality including among those who had had orthopaedic surgery. Orthopaedic patients without and with MINS had a 30-day mortality rate of 1.0% and 9.8%, respectively (odds ratio [OR], 11.28; 95% confidence interval, 6.72 to 18.92). The 30-day mortality rate was increased for patients with MINS who had an ischemic feature (i.e., symptoms, or evidence of ischemia on electrocardiography or imaging) (OR, 18.25; 95% CI, 10.06 to 33.10) and for those who did not have an ischemic feature (OR, 7.35; 95% CI, 3.37 to 16.01). The proportion of orthopaedic patients with MINS who were asymptomatic and in whom the myocardial injury would have probably gone undetected without TnT monitoring was 81.3% (95% CI, 76.3% to 85.4%).

Conclusions

One in 8 orthopaedic patients in our study had MINS, and MINS was associated with a higher mortality rate regardless of symptoms. Troponin levels should be measured after surgery in at-risk patients because most MINS cases (> 80%) are asymptomatic and would go undetected without routine measurements.

Despite these recommendations cardiothoracic surgeons are asked on many occasions to perform CABG on STEMI patients because of technical issues in the catherization laboratory. The findings from our study have been seen previously in a few studies but the debate on the timing of surgical revascularization is still present. Further support for our results has been stated beforehand and documented in the 2004 ACC/AHA guidelines. In the guidelines the management of patients with STEMI gives the following class IIa recommendation: "In patients who have had a STEMI, CABG mortality is elevated for the first 3 to 7 days after infarction, and the benefit of revascularization must be balanced against the increased risk. Patients who have been stabilized after STEMI and who have incurred a significant fall in LV function should have their surgery delayed to allow myocardial recovery to occur". The data from our study supports these statements and further helps to identify the optimal timing when patients should undergo CABG. Frequently, cardiothoracic surgeons do not have the luxury of waiting for 7 days to intervene and as a result reporting the impact of surgery earlier is important to know.

In this study, patients with STEMI who underwent CABG during the first 24 h after the event were found to have higher cardiac, respiratory and renal complications. They were also more likely to have increased in-hospital mortality and a longer length of hospital stay.

### Does cardiology intervention improve mortality for post-operative troponin elevations after emergency orthopaedic-geriatric surgery? A randomised controlled study [^1129ou19]. Injury (2012). Low credibility.

Objectives

Troponin elevations are common after emergency orthopaedic surgery and confer a higher mortality at one year. The objective was to determine if comprehensive cardiology care after emergency orthopaedic surgery reduces mortality at one year in patients who sustain a post-operative troponin elevation versus standard care.

Methods

A randomised controlled trial was conducted at a metropolitan teaching hospital in Melbourne, Australia. 187 consecutive patients were eligible with 70 patients randomised. Troponin I was tested peri-operatively and patients with a troponin elevation were randomised to cardiology care versus standard ward management. The main outcome measure was one year mortality.

Results

The incidence of a post-operative troponin elevation was 37.4% (70/187) and these 70 patients were randomised. In-hospital cardiac complications were similar between the randomised groups: standard care (7/35 or 20.0%) versus cardiology care (8/35 or 22.9%). There was no difference in 1 year mortality between the randomised groups (6/35 or 17.1% in each group). Multivariate predictors of 1 year mortality were post-operative troponin elevation OR 4.3 (95% CI, 1.1–16.4, p = 0.035), age OR 1.1 (95% CI, 1.02–1.2, p = 0.016) and number of comorbidities OR 2.1 (95% CI, 1.3–3.5, p = 0.004). At 1 year 35/187 (18.7%) sustained a cardiac complication and 23/35 (65.7%) had a troponin elevation.

Conclusions

There was no difference in mortality between patients with a post-operative troponin elevation randomised to cardiology care compared with standard care. Troponin elevation predicted one year mortality. Further research is needed to find an effective intervention to reduce mortality.

### Perioperative antiplatelet therapy: the case for continuing therapy in patients at risk of myocardial infarction [^1165aTNE]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2007). Low credibility.

Recent clinical data show that the risk of coronary thrombosis after antiplatelet drugs withdrawal is much higher than that of surgical bleeding if they are continued. In secondary prevention, aspirin is a lifelong therapy and should never be stopped. Clopidogrel is regarded as mandatory until the coronary stents are fully endothelialized, which takes 3 months for bare metal stents, but up to 1 yr for drug-eluting stents. Therefore, interruption of antiplatelet therapy 10 days before surgery should be revised. After reviewing the data on the use of antiplatelet drugs in cardiology and in surgery, we propose an algorithm for the management of patients, based on the risk of myocardial ischaemia and death compared with that of bleeding, for different types of surgery. Even if large prospective studies with a high degree of evidence are still lacking on different antiplatelet regimens during non-cardiac surgery, we propose that, apart from low coronary risk situations, patients on antiplatelet drugs should continue their treatment throughout surgery, except when bleeding might occur in a closed space. A therapeutic bridge with shorter-acting antiplatelet drugs may be considered.

### Management and outcome across the spectrum of high-risk patients with myocardial infarction according to the thrmobolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) risk-score for secondary prevention [^112NgZ7T]. Clinical Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

In view of the above, it is difficult to draw firm conclusions as to the presence of a graded benefit in clinical outcomes with higher patient risk within the high‐risk patient group specifically. However, for the general cohort included in this study, clinical outcomes have changed for the better throughout the two‐time periods, despite these patients' multitude of cardiovascular conditions and risk factors.

This study is based on a large registry of consecutive patients from a tertiary medical center. The data are complete and well documented. Nonetheless, our study has several limitations, including those inherent to a retrospective single‐center study. First, the data on medication use pertained only to the medications at discharge as data with respect to patient adherence to treatment were unavailable. Therefore, we cannot vouch for medication adherence post‐discharge date, though many of these patients continued follow‐up in the hospital clinics. Second, we had no available information regarding the number, location, and specific types of stents deployed, nor did we pertain data concerning periprocedural bleeding complications. Nevertheless, we did obtain data regarding blood transfusions received and hemoglobin levels at several time points during hospitalization and at 1‐year follow‐up. In addition, we lacked data with respect to rehabilitation referral, an important part of guideline‐directed management. Finally, our study cannot infer a causal relationship between the improved treatment and outcome.

### Frequency and impact of cardiology evaluation following perioperative myocardial infarction [^111nofTZ]. Clinical Cardiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Perioperative myocardial infarction (PMI) after noncardiac surgery results in significant morbidity and mortality. While comprehensive management, including imaging and guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT), improves outcomes, utilization of these strategies and the impact of physician evaluation on their utilization are unknown. This study evaluates the frequency of cardiology evaluation after PMI and its association with guideline-recommended care.

Methods

Using IBM MarketScan (2016–2021), we analyzed claims for patients ≥ 45 years old with PMI during or after major noncardiac surgery. We examined the relationship between cardiology evaluation and post-PMI care using three regression models: (1) a Poisson model for GDMT class prescriptions filled within 3 months post-discharge, and logistic models for (2) ischemic testing and (3) echocardiography during hospitalization or within 3 months post-discharge.

Results

Among 5660 patients with PMI (mean age 68, 56.9% male, 27.2% with STEMI), 19% were not evaluated by a cardiologist. Patients with cardiology evaluation were more likely to receive at least one GDMT prescription after PMI (78.8% vs 74.0%, p < 0.001). Cardiology evaluation was also associated with an increased likelihood of ischemic testing (38.2% vs 23.0%, p < 0.001) and echocardiography (75.9% vs 53.6%, p < 0.001).

Conclusion

One in five PMI patients lacks cardiology evaluation, and evaluation is associated with an increased likelihood of recommended management after PMI. Future studies should explore whether cardiology evaluation and management strategies impact patient outcomes.

### Impact of perioperative cardiac assessment guidelines on management of orthopedic surgery patients [^111ToS8k]. The American Journal of Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose

The study assessed whether the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) preoperative cardiac assessment guidelines impact patient management and predict major cardiac events in patients undergoing orthopedic surgery.

Subjects and Methods

We conducted a retrospective review of 338 consecutive orthopedic preoperative evaluations performed by internal medicine consultants. Major cardiac events were defined as myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, and sudden cardiac death.

Results

Major cardiac events occurred in 5.7% of patients. Patients with minor or absent ACC/AHA clinical risk predictors were less likely to have major cardiac events (P = 0.007). More than half (51%) of patients meeting ACC/AHA indications for noninvasive cardiac tests did not receive them. However, most (69%) major cardiac events occurred in patients not meeting criteria for cardiac testing. Abnormal noninvasive cardiac testing results did not alter medication recommendations and only resulted in coronary revascularization in 0.6% of patients. Only 3% of patients with abnormal noninvasive cardiac testing results had major cardiac events. Patients with abnormal cardiac test results were more likely to have recommendations for perioperative beta-blockade (P < .01). Patients aged more than 70 years (odds ratio 5.0; 95% confidence interval, 1.32–19.28) and patients undergoing hip surgery (odds ratio 7.5, 95% confidence interval, 1.02–54.55) were more likely to have major cardiac events. Major cardiac events occurred in 12% of urgent and 4% of elective procedures (P = 0.009).

Conclusions

The ACC/AHA guidelines accurately predict cardiac risk in orthopedic surgery. Abnormal noninvasive cardiac test results rarely affected preoperative recommendations, but improved compliance with beta-blocker therapy. Advanced age, urgent procedures, and hip surgery were associated with increased risk of major cardiac events.

### Management of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction: comparison of the updated guidelines from north America and Europe [^115xT4sB]. American Heart Journal (2009). Low credibility.

The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association and the European Society of Cardiology each recently published updated guidelines for management of patients with acute ST elevation myocardial infarction. In this article, we highlight the most important new recommendations, review their supporting data, and describe differences between the guidelines. Key aspects of these updates include detailed guidance regarding the selection of a reperfusion strategy and the incorporation of newer adjunctive antithrombotic agents. Both new guidelines suggest caution in the administration of intravenous beta-blockers, avoidance of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, and support a more aggressive approach to secondary risk factor management. The 2 guidelines have some nuanced differences as well as some recommendations that are unique to each guideline. They present different levels of support for the 4 available adjunctive parenteral anticoagulants, vary in their endorsement of routine elective coronary angiography after fibrinolysis, and cite different targets for low density lipoprotein long-term. Major unique recommendations include the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Assocaition's emphasis of a stepped approach to analgesia in patients with musculoskeletal pain beginning with acetaminophen or aspirin and a lower target international normalized ratio in patients receiving warfarin, aspirin, and clopidogrel. Meanwhile, unique recommendations in the European Society of Cardiology guidelines include measures to prevent/treat microvascular obstruction and reperfusion injury associated with percutaneous coronary intervention and greater emphasis on maintaining eugylcemia. As these guidelines represent an evidence based approach, health care providers should become familiar with the new data and the resultant updated recommendations to ensure optimal treatment of their patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction.

### Patient blood management program improves blood use and clinical outcomes in orthopedic surgery [^115ve7qM]. Anesthesiology (2018). Low credibility.

What We Already Know About This Topic

WHAT THIS ARTICLE TELLS US THAT IS NEW: BACKGROUND:: Although randomized trials show that patients do well when given less blood, there remains a persistent impression that orthopedic surgery patients require a higher hemoglobin transfusion threshold than other patient populations (8 g/dl vs. 7 g/dl). The authors tested the hypothesis in orthopedic patients that implementation of a patient blood management program encouraging a hemoglobin threshold less than 7 g/dl results in decreased blood use with no change in clinical outcomes.

Methods

After launching a multifaceted patient blood management program, the authors retrospectively evaluated all adult orthopedic patients, comparing transfusion practices and clinical outcomes in the pre- and post-blood management cohorts. Risk adjustment accounted for age, sex, surgical procedure, and case mix index.

Results

After patient blood management implementation, the mean hemoglobin threshold decreased from 7.8 ± 1.0 g/dl to 6.8 ± 1.0 g/dl (P < 0.0001). Erythrocyte use decreased by 32.5% (from 338 to 228 erythrocyte units per 1,000 patients; P = 0.0007). Clinical outcomes improved, with decreased morbidity (from 1.3% to 0.54%; P = 0.01), composite morbidity or mortality (from 1.5% to 0.75%; P = 0.035), and 30-day readmissions (from 9.0% to 5.8%; P = 0.0002). Improved outcomes were primarily recognized in patients 65 yr of age and older. After risk adjustment, patient blood management was independently associated with decreased composite morbidity or mortality (odds ratio, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.22 to 0.86; P = 0.016).

Conclusions

In a retrospective study, patient blood management was associated with reduced blood use with similar or improved clinical outcomes in orthopedic surgery. A hemoglobin threshold of 7 g/dl appears to be safe for many orthopedic patients.

### Predicting risk of cardiovascular events 1 to 3 years post-myocardial infarction using a global registry [^113bHHa7]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

6 CONCLUSION

We have described how risk of subsequent cardiovascular events and death varies substantially among patients 1 to 3 years post‐MI. A risk index based on 11 readily available items enables stratification of such patients into markedly different risk categories. Such knowledge could help identify very high‐risk patients in need of more intensive management.

The American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association last published evidence-based guidelines for the management of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) in 1999. In mid-2004, in recognition of the evolution and improvement of many of the most basic tenets of clinical management of STEMI since that time, an updated edition of the STEMI guidelines has been published. These guidelines offer many evidence-based recommendations that are pertinent to the out-of-hospital and emergency department care of STEMI patients, including initial evaluation, risk stratification, stabilizing management, and the choice between pharmacologic and mechanical revascularization. These are presented and discussed here.

### Perioperative management of patients with drug-eluting stents [^111kje1B]. JACC: Cardiovascular Interventions (2010). Low credibility.

Thrombosis of a drug-eluting stent (DES) is a catastrophic complication. The risk of stent thrombosis (ST) is increased in the perioperative setting and is strongly associated with the cessation of antiplatelet therapy. This article reviews the perioperative management of patients with DES with a clinical focus on the perioperative use of antiplatelet therapy. Cessation of dual antiplatelet therapy is the single most significant predictor of perioperative ST. Available data on perioperative management of patients with DES are limited, and recommendations are therefore limited. To avoid ST with DES, aspirin and thienopyridines should ideally be continued throughout surgery. In spite of the increased risk of bleeding, this strategy is acceptable in many types of invasive surgical procedures with no change in outcome. However, if the bleeding risk outweighs the risk of ST, other potential strategies include treatment with aspirin alone, "bridging therapy" with aspirin and a glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor and/or heparin, and "bridging therapy" without aspirin. Novel antiplatelet therapies are promising and potentially valuable in the perioperative management of patients with DES. Maintaining dual antiplatelet therapy is the mainstay of perioperative ST prevention. However, short-term discontinuation of thienopyridines might be associated with relatively low risk if aspirin therapy is maintained perioperatively.

### Paired risk scores to predict ischaemic and bleeding risk twenty-eight days to one year after an acute coronary syndrome [^111w1N9U]. Heart (2023). Medium credibility.

Clinical implications and implementation

In an era of shared decision making, it is important to provide patients and clinicians with objective risk estimates as a basis for deciding on management. The ANZACS-QI risk scores presented here are calculated at hospital discharge using data consistently available at that time point. They provide an estimate of risks from 28 days to 1 year as long as the patient remains event free at 1 month. Consequently, they can be used at discharge to plan DAPT duration beyond a month. In clinical practice, if an event does occur within the first 28 days the estimated risks are no longer relevant and the decision to stop or continue DAPT must be individualised.

The evidence around DAPT duration post-ACS continues to evolve, and the role of ischaemic and bleeding risk scores requires justification in prospective clinical trials. In table 5, we have proposed a potential clinical and research algorithm based on the recent ESC recommendations applied to the ANZACS-QI risk categories. The one-third of the cohort at elevated bleeding risk were also mostly at elevated ischaemic risk. As discussed above, recent clinical trials suggest that in these patients the efficacy of DAPT for reducing ischaemic events may be less than for patients at lower bleeding risk and an abbreviated DAPT duration is recommended. The ESC currently recommend a default 12 months of DAPT in all those at low bleeding risk. However, the ESC also recommends that for those at low risk of major bleeding and an elevated ischaemic risk (37% of our cohort), more prolonged DAPT may be justified, and for those with low bleeding and ischaemic risk (29% of our cohort) a shorter period of DAPT may be justified. In clinical practice, there are other factors which might also influence the decision regarding DAPT duration. These include procedural variables such as stent type, lesion location and length, and vessel size, and specific clinical situations such as the need for non-cardiac surgery. In addition to informing DAPT duration decisions, the bleeding risk estimates are useful to decide on whether to use a potent P2Y12 receptor inhibitor (ticagrelor or prasugrel) or the less potent clopidogrel.

### Perioperative management of antithrombotic therapy: an American College of Chest Physicians clinical practice guideline [^116LfKye]. Chest (2022). High credibility.

Patients with coronary stents having surgery — Perioperative antiplatelet management evidence indicates that stent thrombosis "occurs in 2% to 5% of patients and is associated with mortality as high as 50%". In a POISE-2 subanalysis of "470 patients with a coronary stent who required major non-cardiac surgery", continuing ASA preoperatively was associated with lower myocardial infarction "(5.1% vs 11.0%; HR = 0.45; 95% CI: 0.22–0.87)" but a small increase in major bleeding "(4.6% vs 3.8%; HR = 1.22; 95% CI: 1.01–1.48)". Observational data found that interruption "for > 5 days" predicted major adverse events "(OR = 2.11; 95% CI: 1.23–3.63)" and "no perioperative antiplatelet therapy" also increased risk "(OR = 3.73; 95% CI: 1.26–11.07)". A systematic review reported variable adverse cardiovascular event rates "(0%-21%)" and bleeding "(0%-22%)" across strategies and "no observable pattern of adverse outcome incidence". Timing studies noted highest risk in the first "6 weeks after stent placement (8% to 10%)" with rates that "plateau at 6 months (1%–2%) and remain stable at 24 months". In a database study comparing "4,303 patients with and 20,232 patients without" recent drug-eluting stent placement, stenting was associated with higher myocardial infarction "(1.6% vs 0.2%; OR = 4.82; 95% CI: 3.25–7.16)" and cardiac death "(1.0% vs 0.2%; OR = 5.87; 95% CI: 3.60–9.58)", significant only if surgery occurred "within 1 month of stenting". Regarding bridging, an IV cangrelor randomized trial reported no effect on CABG-related bleeding "(OR = 1.15; 95% CI: 0.47–2.79)" or other adverse events "(7.8% vs 5.2%; p = 0.45)", and observational studies of "IV UFH", "subcutaneous LMWH", or "short-acting IV glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors" found "no clear benefits of these approaches".

### Myocardial injury in patients with hip fracture: a HIP ATTACK randomized trial substudy [^116BqPYf]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Myocardial injury after a hip fracture is common and has a poor prognosis. Patients with a hip fracture and myocardial injury may benefit from accelerated surgery to remove the physiological stress associated with the hip fracture. This study aimed to determine if accelerated surgery is superior to standard care in terms of the 90-day risk of death in patients with a hip fracture who presented with an elevated cardiac biomarker/enzyme measurement at hospital arrival.

Methods

The HIP fracture Accelerated surgical TreaTment And Care tracK (HIP ATTACK) trial was a randomized controlled trial designed to determine whether accelerated surgery for hip fracture was superior to standard care in reducing death or major complications. This substudy is a post-hoc analysis of 1392 patients (from the original study of 2970 patients) who had a cardiac biomarker/enzyme measurement (> 99.9% had a troponin measurement and thus "troponin" is the term used throughout the paper) at hospital arrival. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality. The secondary composite outcome included all-cause mortality and non-fatal myocardial infarction, stroke, and congestive heart failure 90 days after randomization.

Results

Three hundred and twenty-two (23%) of the 1392 patients had troponin elevation at hospital arrival. Among the patients with troponin elevation, the median time from hip fracture diagnosis to surgery was 6 hours (interquartile range [IQR] = 5 to 13) in the accelerated surgery group and 29 hours (IQR = 19 to 52) in the standard care group. Patients with troponin elevation had a lower risk of mortality with accelerated surgery compared with standard care (17 [10%] of 163 versus 36 [23%] of 159; hazard ratio [HR] = 0.43 [95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.24 to 0.77]) and a lower risk of the secondary composite outcome (23 [14%] of 163 versus 47 [30%] of 159; HR = 0.43 [95% CI = 0.26 to 0.72]).

Conclusions

One in 5 patients with a hip fracture presented with myocardial injury. Accelerated surgery resulted in a lower mortality risk than standard care for these patients; however, these findings need to be confirmed.

Smilowitz et al. found that kidney transplant procedures had lower adjusted odds of death and stroke, but two-fold higher odds of AMI when compared to other procedures (again, not limited to those with kidney failure). In absolute risk, 0.5% of kidney transplant recipients died in hospital in their study, and 1.2% had an AMI during their index transplant admission. In another study from the same group, perioperative AMI occurred in approximately 2.7% of people with kidney failure after major non-cardiac surgery. These estimates of cardiac event risk are similar to our own. Both of our studies used the same algorithms to identify ST-segment elevation MIs (STEMIs) and Non-STEMIs. These codes should not identify less severe presentations which may be asymptomatic, highlighting the difficulty in ascertaining postoperative AMIs from administrative data sources. With the degree of baseline cardiac enzyme elevation in the kidney failure population, diagnosis of asymptomatic perioperative AMIs is challenging. Routine monitoring of cardiac biomarkers in higher risk patients postoperatively has only been recently recognized as important to identify otherwise asymptomatic myocardial injury, and recommended by our national perioperative risk stratification guidelines. Importantly, this monitoring practice was not in place during the period of this cohort study and therefore we likely underestimated perioperative CV event occurrence.

ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) with multivessel disease (MVD) — complete revascularization with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) has shown benefit versus culprit-only strategies in randomized trials. PRAMI randomized 465 patients with STEMI and MVD to complete revascularization versus culprit artery only revascularization, and the trial was stopped early due to a significant reduction in the primary composite endpoint with complete revascularization. The COMPLETE trial randomized 4041 patients with STEMI and significant MVD to staged PCI of the non–infarct-related artery (performed up to 45 days post MI) versus culprit vessel–only revascularization, and at a median follow-up of 3 years multivessel PCI reduced cardiovascular death or myocardial infarction (MI) and the composite of cardiovascular death, MI, or ischemia-driven revascularization. Angina-related quality of life improved with multivessel PCI, and a meta-analysis found reduced cardiovascular death in patients with STEMI; however, a meta-analysis across trials did not suggest any differential benefit for complete revascularization when guided by fractional flow reserve (FFR) versus angiography. The benefits of complete revascularization with multivessel PCI should not be extrapolated to patients with disease more suited to coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery because they were excluded from these trials.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Left ventricular (LV) thrombus after myocardial infarction — risk, imaging, and antithrombotic therapy: In the era of PCI, the incidence of LV thrombus after ACS has decreased and is estimated to be < 5% to 10% in the post-MI population, and limited RCT data are available with current management based mostly on retrospective and observational data and expert consensus; patients at highest risk include anterior ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) involving the left anterior descending artery, LVEF < 30% (especially with an LV aneurysm), and longer times to reperfusion. An echocardiogram is the recommended imaging modality for diagnosis, whereas cardiac MRI is more sensitive for detection of LV thrombus and may be considered when there is high clinical suspicion and echocardiogram results are inconclusive; LV thrombus may form later during hospitalization or after discharge, so repeat imaging can sometimes detect LV thrombus in high-risk patients. Because DAPT is recommended for most patients early after ACS, the addition of an anticoagulant for LV thrombus needs to be considered in the context of bleeding versus embolic risk; most patients with LV thrombus will warrant anticoagulation for a period of 3 months, with repeat imaging to assess residual thrombus to decide on a more prolonged course if warranted. Although direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC) are routinely used, there are limited data comparing a DOAC versus vitamin K antagonist; observational studies and small RCTs have suggested that DOAC may be noninferior with respect to mortality, stroke, or LV thrombus resolution, and DOACs may offer an improved bleeding profile.

### Characterization of post-operative risk associated with prior drug-eluting stent use [^114ZkeBP]. JACC: Cardiovascular Interventions (2009). Low credibility.

Objectives

The aim of this study was to assess risk of inpatient surgery at any time after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with drug-eluting stents (DES).

Background

Risk of adverse events, including stent thrombosis (ST), in patients undergoing surgical procedures with prior DES remains poorly defined.

Methods

Outcomes of consecutive patients having inpatient surgical procedures after PCI with DES, placed from April 28, 2003 until December 31, 2006 at a tertiary-care medical center, were studied. Primary and secondary end points were 30-day post-operative risk of the Academic Research Consortium (ARC) definite and modified probable definitions of ST and combined 30-day post-operative risk of death, nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI), or ST, respectively. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to determine independent risk factors.

Results

Six hundred six inpatient surgeries on 481 patients with a mean time from PCI to surgery of 1.07 ± 0.89 years were evaluated. The primary and secondary end points occurred after 11 (2.0%) and 56 (9%) surgeries, respectively. Risk of the combined end point and ST decreased significantly in the first 1 to 6 months after PCI (p < 0.0001 and p < 0.014, respectively); however, risk persisted when time between PCI and surgery was > 12 months. Independent correlates of the combined end point include emergency surgery, antecedent MI, the pre-operative use of intravenous heparin, and atherosclerotic lesion length treated with DES. Oral antiplatelet status at time of surgery was not a correlate of events.

Conclusions

Risk of 30-day post-operative adverse events, including ST, remains significantly higher when surgery is performed soon after PCI, while intermediate-term risk extending at least 2 to 3 years remains important.

### Ivabradine in the prevention, and reduction in size, of perioperative myocardial injury in patients undergoing orthopedic surgery for acute fracture [^114QaWyh]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Postoperative hemoglobin and renal function were not statistically different between groups. Renal function remained similar to preoperative values, whereas mean hemoglobin across the whole cohort decreased from 124.5 (121.9–127.0) g/L preoperatively to 108.6 (106.4–111.6) g/L postoperatively.

Consistent with the mechanism of action of ivabradine and the associations seen between treatment group and high‐sensitivity troponin, there was a nonstatistically significant trend toward patients with lower average heart rates having lower high‐sensitivity troponin elevations, independent of treatment arm. Evident across all patients, this was particularly notable in patients with PMI (as per the universal definition of myocardial infarction), as seen in Figure 3B: those with the highest categories of peak troponin elevation had higher heart rates over time. The differences did not reach statistical significance.

Of all patients with a positive troponin recorded postoperatively, only 3 reported chest pain on any postoperative day (1 ivabradine group, 2 placebo group). Ischemic ECG changes occurred in 17 (29%) of the total 59 patients with troponin elevation, most commonly T‐wave inversion (5 in the ivabradine group and 12 in the placebo group; P = 0.08). One patient in the placebo arm had ST‐segment elevation in a single lead that did not meet ST‐segment–elevation myocardial infarction criteria.

Of those with PMI, 4 had a clinical diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction by the treating team at the time, of whom 2 underwent coronary angiography and 2 were conservatively medically managed. One angiogram occurred preoperatively, revealing severe triple‐vessel disease that was managed medically after extensive family discussion about coronary artery bypass grafting; this patient subsequently underwent orthopedic surgery. The second patient had his/her coronary angiogram postoperatively, revealing a chronic total occlusion of the right coronary artery that was managed medically with dual antiplatelet therapy.

### Acute coronary syndrome and myocardial infarction after orthopedic surgery in a patient with a recently placed drug-eluting stent [^112RWibm]. Journal of Clinical Anesthesia (2006). Low credibility.

Providing anesthesia care for patients who have recently undergone intracoronary drug-eluting stent placement presents unique clinical challenges. It is currently recommended that these patients remain on antiplatelet therapy until reendothelialization of the vessel has occurred (ie, 3–6 months, depending on the eluting medication) to prevent stent restenosis. In the setting of urgent or emergent surgery, it may not be possible to wait until a full course of antiplatelet therapy has been completed. We report an unusual case of postoperative acute coronary syndrome in a gentleman who underwent intracoronary stenting 7 weeks before nonelective revision hip arthroplasty. To our knowledge, this is the first case in the anesthesia literature to report postoperative cardiac morbidity after recent drug-eluting stent deployment.

### Invasive and antiplatelet treatment of patients with non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction: understanding and addressing the global risk-treatment paradox [^114MNqKw]. Clinical Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

4 CONCLUSIONS

Patients with NSTEMI have a higher long‐term mortality risk than patients with STEMI but are often treated less aggressively, with those who have the highest ischemic risk often receiving the least aggressive treatment (the "treatment‐risk paradox"). The suboptimal treatment of patients with NSTEMI can be explained by the heterogeneity of patient characteristics, an underestimation of the high ischemic risk compared with bleeding risk by physicians, procedure availability, and policy. To address these challenges, potential approaches include: developing guidelines and protocols that include rigorous definitions of NSTEMI, risk assessment, and integrated quality assessment measures; providing education to physicians on the management of long‐term cardiovascular risk in patients with NSTEMI; and making stents and antiplatelet therapies more accessible to patients.

### Bridging antiplatelet therapy after percutaneous coronary intervention: JACC review topic of the week [^115QHwFX]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Patients undergoing early surgery after coronary stent implantation are at increased risk for mortality from ischemic and hemorrhagic complications. The optimal antiplatelet strategy in patients who cannot discontinue dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) before surgery is unclear. Current guidelines, based on surgical and clinical characteristics, provide risk stratification for bridging therapy with intravenous antiplatelet agents, but management is guided primarily by expert opinion. This review summarizes perioperative risk factors to consider before discontinuing DAPT and reviews the data for intravenous bridging therapies. Published reports have included bridging options such as small molecule glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors (eptifibatide or tirofiban) and cangrelor, an intravenous P2Y 12 inhibitor. However, optimal management of these complex patients remains unclear in the absence of randomized controlled data, without which an argument can be made both for and against the use of perioperative intravenous bridging therapy after discontinuing oral P2Y 12 inhibitors. Multidisciplinary risk assessment remains a critical component of perioperative care.

Perioperative medication management — anticoagulation — "Perioperative management of anticoagulation medications warrants consideration before foot and ankle surgical procedures" was appropriate, and "the panel reached consensus that foot and ankle surgeons should consider and be cognizant of anticoagulation medications in the perioperative period but also concluded that this specific management was probably best deferred to the patient's primary care physician, cardiologist, or vascular surgeon when possible". The American College of Chest Physicians guidelines state that "these guidelines recommend discontinuing vitamin K antagonists 5 days before surgery and resuming the anticoagulant 12 to 24 hours after surgery when hemostasis has been achieved", "Bridging anticoagulation is recommended for patients at high risk of thromboembolism", and "In patients with a relatively low risk of thromboembolism, bridging was not recommended". "For patients taking aspirin and aspirin monotherapy prior to surgery, it was recommended that aspirin should be continued around the time of surgery rather than discontinuing it for 7 to 10 days before the procedure". "In patients with a coronary stent who require surgery, it is recommended that surgical intervention should be delayed 6 weeks after bare metal stent placement and 6 months after drug-eluting stent placement", and "If surgery is required during those periods, it is recommended that the antithrombotic therapy be continued through the surgery rather than stopping the therapy". "We recommend that foot and ankle surgeons familiarize themselves with these guidelines".

### Continuation versus discontinuation of antiplatelet therapy for bleeding and ischaemic events in adults undergoing non-cardiac surgery [^112kQLKd]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Antiplatelet agents are recommended for people with myocardial infarction and acute coronary syndromes, transient ischaemic attack or stroke, and for those in whom coronary stents have been inserted. People who take antiplatelet agents are at increased risk of adverse events when undergoing non-cardiac surgery because of these indications. However, taking antiplatelet therapy also introduces risk to the person undergoing surgery because the likelihood of bleeding is increased. Discontinuing antiplatelet therapy before surgery might reduce this risk but subsequently it might make thrombotic problems, such as myocardial infarction, more likely.

Objectives

To compare the effects of continuation versus discontinuation for at least five days of antiplatelet therapy on the occurrence of bleeding and ischaemic events in adults undergoing non-cardiac surgery under general, spinal or regional anaesthesia.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2018, Issue 1), MEDLINE (1946 to January 2018), and Embase (1974 to January 2018). We searched clinical trials registers for ongoing studies, and conducted backward and forward citation searching of relevant articles.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials of adults who were taking single or dual antiplatelet therapy, for at least two weeks, and were scheduled for elective non-cardiac surgery. Included participants had at least one cardiac risk factor. We planned to include quasi-randomized studies. We excluded people scheduled for minor surgeries under local anaesthetic or sedation in which bleeding that required transfusion or additional surgery was unlikely. We included studies which compared perioperative continuation of antiplatelet therapy versus discontinuation of antiplatelet therapy or versus substitution of antiplatelet therapy with a placebo for at least five days before surgery.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion, extracted data, assessed risk of bias and synthesized findings. Our primary outcomes were: all-cause mortality at longest follow-up (up to six months); all-cause mortality (up to 30 days). Secondary outcomes included: blood loss requiring transfusion of blood products; blood loss requiring further surgical intervention; risk of ischaemic events. We used GRADE to assess the quality of evidence for each outcome MAIN RESULTS: We included five RCTs with 666 randomized adults. We identified three ongoing studies. All study participants were scheduled for elective general surgery (including abdominal, urological, orthopaedic and gynaecological surgery) under general, spinal or regional anaesthesia. Studies compared continuation of single or dual antiplatelet therapy (aspirin or clopidogrel) with discontinuation of therapy for at least five days before surgery. Three studies reported adequate methods of randomization, and two reported methods to conceal allocation. Three studies were placebo-controlled trials and were at low risk of performance bias, and three studies reported adequate methods to blind outcome assessors to group allocation. Attrition was limited in four studies and two studies had reported prospective registration with clinical trial registers and were at low risk of selective outcome reporting bias. We reported mortality at two time points: the longest follow-up reported by study authors up to six months, and time point reported by study authors up to 30 days. Five studies reported mortality up to six months (of which four studies had a longest follow-up at 30 days, and one study at 90 days) and we found that either continuation or discontinuation of antiplatelet therapy may make little or no difference to mortality up to six months (risk ratio (RR) 1.21, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.34 to 4.27; 659 participants; low-certainty evidence); the absolute effect is three more deaths per 1000 with continuation of antiplatelets (ranging from eight fewer to 40 more). Combining the four studies with a longest follow-up at 30 days alone showed the same effect estimate, and we found that either continuation or discontinuation of antiplatelet therapy may make little or no difference to mortality at 30 days after surgery (RR 1.21, 95% CI 0.34 to 4.27; 616 participants; low-certainty evidence); the absolute effect is three more deaths per 1000 with continuation of antiplatelets (ranging from nine fewer to 42 more). We found that either continuation or discontinuation of antiplatelet therapy probably makes little or no difference in incidences of blood loss requiring transfusion (RR 1.37, 95% CI 0.83 to 2.26; 368 participants; absolute effect of 42 more participants per 1000 requiring transfusion in the continuation group, ranging from 19 fewer to 119 more; four studies; moderate-certainty evidence); and may make little or no difference in incidences of blood loss requiring additional surgery (RR 1.54, 95% CI 0.31 to 7.58; 368 participants; absolute effect of six more participants per 1000 requiring additional surgery in the continuation group, ranging from seven fewer to 71 more; four studies; low-certainty evidence). We found that either continuation or discontinuation of antiplatelet therapy may make little or no difference to incidences of ischaemic events (to include peripheral ischaemia, cerebral infarction, and myocardial infarction) within 30 days of surgery (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.25 to 1.77; 616 participants; absolute effect of 17 fewer participants per 1000 with an ischaemic event in the continuation group, ranging from 39 fewer to 40 more; four studies; low-certainty evidence). We used the GRADE approach to downgrade evidence for all outcomes owing to limited evidence from few studies. We noted a wide confidence in effect estimates for mortality at the end of follow-up and at 30 days, and for blood loss requiring transfusion which suggested imprecision. We noted visual differences in study results for ischaemic events which suggested inconsistency.

Authors' Conclusions

We found low-certainty evidence that either continuation or discontinuation of antiplatelet therapy before non-cardiac surgery may make little or no difference to mortality, bleeding requiring surgical intervention, or ischaemic events. We found moderate-certainty evidence that either continuation or discontinuation of antiplatelet therapy before non-cardiac surgery probably makes little or no difference to bleeding requiring transfusion. Evidence was limited to few studies with few participants, and with few events. The three ongoing studies may alter the conclusions of the review once published and assessed.

### Time since prior NSTEMI and MACCE after noncardiac surgery… [^115cgR9x]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Meaning Delaying surgery 90 to 180 days after an NSTEMI in patients who have had revascularization may be reasonable. Importance Delaying elective noncardiac surgery after a recent acute myocardial infarction is associated with better outcomes, but current American Heart Association recommendations are based on data that are more than 20 years old. The odds of postoperative MACCE leveled off after 30 days in patients who had undergone any coronary revascularization procedure and then increased after 180 days. The odds of MACCE did not level off for patients who did not have revascularization.

Findings for all-cause 30-day mortality were similar to those for MACCE, except that the odds of mortality in patients with previous NSTEMI who had revascularization leveled off after 60 days in elective surgeries and 90 days for nonelective surgeries. Conclusions and Relevance This study found that among older patients undergoing noncardiac surgery who had revascularization, the odds of postoperative MACCE and mortality leveled off between 30 and 90 days and then increased after 180 days. The odds did not level off for patients who did not have revascularization. Delaying elective noncardiac surgery to occur between 90 and 180 days after an NSTEMI may be reasonable for patients who have had revascularization.

### The ongoing dilemma of timing noncardiac surgery after NSTEMI… [^113T5LiJ]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Determining the optimal timing for noncardiac surgery in patients with underlying ischemic heart disease, particularly after recent myocardial infarction, is challenging. The ACC/AHA guidelines recommend delaying noncardiac surgery for more than 60 days after an MI treated without coronary intervention and 365 days after drug-eluding stent implantation. Noncardiac surgery can be considered after 180 days from DES but with the caveat that dual-antiplatelet therapy should not be discontinued perioperatively.

### ACC / AHA guideline update for the management of ST-segment… [^112hoKP7]. AAFP (2009). Low credibility.

Acute Management STEMI is defined as ST-segment elevation of greater than 0. 1 mV in at least two contiguous precordial or adjacent limb leads, a new left bundle branch block, or a true posterior MI. The most important point in managing STEMI is minimizing the time from the onset of symptoms until the initiation of reperfusion therapy. The goal is for fibrinolysis to begin less than 30 minutes from the time of the patient's first contact with the health care system, or for balloon inflation for PCI to begin in less than 90 minutes. Figure 1 summarizes the recommended approach to a patient with STEMI, and it reviews conditions in which PCI or fibrinolysis is preferred or contraindicated. 1 Patients with STEMI who present within 12 hours of symptom onset and do not have contraindications should receive reperfusion therapy.

Patients with MI with ST-segment depression should not be treated with fibrinolysis unless they have a true posterior MI. Rescue PCI is reasonable in patients who have less than 50 percent resolution of ST-segment elevation 90 minutes after initiation of fibrinolytic therapy and a moderately large area of myocardium at risk. The routine use of intravenous beta blocker therapy in the acute phase of STEMI is not recommended because of the increased risk of cardiogenic shock, based on findings from the COMMIT/CCS-2 study. Changes in Post-STEMI Management Patients who receive pharmacologic reperfusion therapy should receive subsequent anticoagulation therapy for a minimum of 48 hours. There is no evidence of benefit for unfractionated heparin beyond 48 hours unless there are ongoing indications for anticoagulation.

Low-molecular-weight heparin may be used instead for the duration of the hospitalization, up to eight days, if the patient has no significant renal dysfunction. The update lists effective anticoagulation regimens. In patients with baremetal stents, clopidogrel should be continued for at least one month; it should be continued for several months in patients with drug-eluting stents and 12 months in patients who are not at high risk of bleeding.

### ACC / AHA release guidelines on management of patients… [^115tg8Zj]. AAFP (2004). Low credibility.

Intravenous, oral, or topical nitrates are useful beyond the first 48 hours after STEMI for treatment of recurrent angina or persistent congestive heart failure if their use does not preclude therapy with beta blockers or ACE inhibitors. Class IIb The continued use of nitrate therapy beyond the first 24 to 48 hours in the absence of continued or recurrent angina or CHF may be helpful, although the benefit is likely to be small and is not well established in contemporary practice. INHIBITION OF THE RENIN-ANGIOTENSIN-ALDOSTERONE SYSTEM Class I An ACE inhibitor should be administered orally during convalescence from STEMI in patients who tolerate this class of medication, and it should be continued over the long term.

For patients who have undergone diagnostic cardiac catheterization and for whom percutaneous coronary intervention is planned, clopidogrel should be started and continued for at least one month after bare metal stent implantation and up to 12 months in patients who are not at high risk for bleeding. Antithrombotics Class I Intravenous unfractionated heparin or low-molecular-weight heparin should be used in patients after STEMI who are at high risk for systemic emboli.

Class IIa It is reasonable that patients with STEMI who are not undergoing reperfusion therapy and do not have a contraindication to anticoagulation be treated with intravenous or subcutaneous unfractionated heparin or with subcutaneous LMWH for at least 48 hours. In patients whose clinical condition necessitates prolonged bed rest and/or minimized activities, it is reasonable that treatment be continued until the patient is ambulatory.
