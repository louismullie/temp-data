## Question

Porche has 3 hours to get all her homework done. Her math homework takes her 45 minutes. Her English homework takes her 30 minutes. Her science homework takes her 50 minutes. Her history homework takes her 25 minutes. She also has a special project due the next day. How much time does she have left to get that project done?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how much time Porche has left to complete her special project after finishing her math, English, science, and history homework within a 3-hour window. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about converting the total available time into minutes. Then, I should add up the time required for each subject's homework. Next, I will subtract the total homework time from the total available time to find the remaining minutes. Finally, I will convert the remaining minutes back into hours and minutes to give a clear answer.

> Let me first confirm the total available time. Three hours equals 180 minutes, so Porche has 180 minutes to work with in total.

> Now, I need to add up the homework durations carefully. Math takes 45 minutes, English takes 30 minutes, science takes 50 minutes, and history takes 25 minutes. Adding these together, 45 + 30 + 50 + 25 equals 150 minutes of homework time.

> Wait, let me verify the subtraction before I conclude. Total available time is 180 minutes minus total homework time of 150 minutes, which leaves 30 minutes remaining for the special project.

> I should double-check the unit conversion to make sure the final phrasing is precise. Thirty minutes is exactly 0.5 hours, so Porche has 30 minutes, or half an hour, left to complete her special project.

Porche has **30 minutes** left to complete her special project. Here's the math: total homework time is 45 + 30 + 50 + 25 = 150 minutes, and 3 hours is 180 minutes, so 180 − 150 = 30 minutes remaining.

---

## Step-by-step calculation

| **Subject** | **Time required (minutes)** |
|-|-|
| Math | 45 |
| English | 30 |
| Science | 50 |
| History | 25 |
| Total homework time | 150 |

---

Total available time = 3 hours = 180 minutes\
Time remaining = 180 minutes − 150 minutes = **30 minutes**

---

Porche has **30 minutes** left to complete her special project.

### Long duration of stressful homework as a potential obesogenic factor in children: a QUALITY study [^112izP66]. Obesity (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

To examine for the first time whether stressful mental tasks are associated with an unfavorable anthropometric profile in children.

Methods

A cross-sectional analysis was undertaken in 511 children. A complete anthropometric profile was assessed, and children reported their homework duration and the presence/absence of stress related to schoolwork. Accelerometers and questionnaires provided the other profile of lifestyle components.

Results

Homework duration was not related to adiposity indicators in children not stressed by schoolwork. In boys stressed by schoolwork, significantly higher total and trunk body fat percentages were obtained in the high versus low duration of homework group. No difference in adiposity indicators was present in boys not stressed by schoolwork and in girls. A reduced activity level and an increased screen time partly mediated the relationship between homework and anthropometric profiles.

Conclusions

Boys with a high workload of homework, when combined with the presence of schoolwork-related stress, have unfavorable adiposity indicators. This study suggests that more attention should be paid to stressful mental work as a potent risk factor for obesity.

### Total workload and recovery in relation to worktime reduction: a randomised controlled intervention study with time-use data [^111M1M5Y]. Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Exploring subgroups

When adding gender as an additional between-group factor, the analyses showed no significant effects of gender in relation to the intervention, neither in the crude models (data and results in table 3) nor in the adjusted models. There was no effect of gender on the amount of paid work, non-paid work, total workload or recovery activities, neither on workdays nor on days off (data and results in table 3). The adjusted models did not change these results.

Adding having children living at home (yes/no) as a between-group factor showed no differences in the effect of the intervention on time-use depending on being a parent or not (see online supplementary table A). Moreover, adding sharing household with a partner (yes/no) to the model yielded one significant effect on the amount of paid work on days off (see online supplementary table B). This effect disappeared in the adjusted model.

Living alone with children did not influence the effects of the intervention neither in the crude (see online supplementary table C) nor in the adjusted model, and neither did job nature, in terms of working area or working shift (see online supplementary table D and E).

Ethical considerations

The GSHS adhered to human subjects' protection standards. Each participating country approved the research project through their local government administrations. Additionally, all studies received approval from ethics committees in their respective countries and followed the standards established by the WHO. Data from this study and detailed methods used in the GSHS are described online on the WHO website and in other publications. Participation was voluntary; adolescents provided their assent, and informed consent was obtained from their parents or guardians. All methods were performed in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration and guidelines.

Physical activity, transportation to or from school and sitting time

Total PA was assessed using the following question: "During the last 7 days, on how many days did you engage in PA for a total of at least 60 minutes per day?" (Add up all the time you spent in any kind of PA each day). Responses ranged from 0 to 7 days. PA was defined as any activity that increases the heart rate or leaves the student out of breath. This includes leisure sports, exercising with friends, or active transportation to or from school. Based on their responses, adolescents were classified as physically inactive (0 days), insufficiently active (1 to 4 days), or physically active (5 or more days).

Transportation to or from school refers to how adolescents travel between home and school. This was assessed with the question, "In the last 7 days, on how many days did you walk or ride a bicycle to or from school?" Possible answers ranged from 0 to 7 days. Adolescents who walked or cycled to or from school at least 3 days a week were considered to be engaging in active transportation, as 3 days represent the majority of school days in a week.

Time spent sitting was evaluated with the question, "How much time do you spend on a typical day sitting and watching television, playing on the computer, talking with friends, or doing other activities while seated, such as surfing the internet?" (Excluding time spent sitting at school or for homework). Response options included "less than 1 hour/day", "1 to 2 hours/day", "3 to 4 hours/day", "5 to 6 hours/day", "7 to 8 hours/day", or "more than 8 hours/day". A cut-off of 3 or more hours/day was used to define excessive sedentary time, based on previous associations with adverse health outcomes.

### Clinical impact of 3-vs. 5-minute delay and 30-vs. 60-second intervals on unattended automated office blood pressure measurements [^116canYJ]. American Journal of Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

Multiple guidelines recommend 1–2 minutes between BP measurements, based on a few studies showing minimal differences between 1- and 2-minute intervals. However, data comparing measurements with shorter time intervals are limited. Imamura and colleagues found similar performance between measurements with 30- and 60-second intervals. Our previous work in a distinct group of over 100 patients found that a 30-second interval was statistically equivalent to 60 seconds in the clinic setting following a 5-minute delay. The present study examined this question after a 3-minute delay, showing similar accuracy and precision between shorter and longer intervals regardless of the initial delay. Another important consideration is the sequence effect, which has been well-described and has been a major rationale behind discarding the first measurement when assessing BP. Later measures may be especially influenced by a shorter interval. Nevertheless, we did not observe consistent differences across protocol assignments even after discarding the first measurement.

### A 20-week, randomized controlled trial to determine the efficacy of the aging well through interaction and scientific education-action plan (ageWISE-AP) program in older veterans [^116k493J]. BMC Geriatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

The study has been approved by the VA's Central Institutional Review Board (cIRB) and Scientific Review Committee. Participant recruitment is at a target rate of 1–2 Veterans a week, projected at approximately 16 Veterans per study quarter during months 4 through 27 (see Table 3). The Bedford VA Healthcare System is a Category 3 facility located in the north-west suburbs of Boston serving approximately 20,000 Veterans with the bulk of clinical services in mental health, primary care, and geriatrics and extended care. Participants will be recruited from neurological, psychological, geriatric, and primary care services.

Table 3
Project Timeline

For Aims 1 through 3 (Primary Aims), the baseline evaluation takes participants an average of 1.25 h (1 h and 15 min) to complete the following measures, including collection of the demographic data (see below); sessions can be broken into two sessions as needed to minimize any fatigue. Follow-up evaluations take place immediately after the AgeWISE-AP intervention has ended (immediate post intervention), 3-months post intervention, and 6-months post intervention (i.e. 1 year after enrollment) and take an estimated hour and a half to complete. Structural imaging data is collected at baseline and again at one year, taking an estimated hour and a half to complete, with 30–45 min preparation for scanning and another 45 min of time spent in the scanner.

Assessments

The outcome measures for this study were chosen to inform our specific aims. We seek to investigate whether AgeWISE-AP boosts older Veterans' engagement in lifestyle activities that promote brain health (Aim 1) and improves psychological wellbeing (Aim 2) and cognition (Aim 3) compared to a treatment as usual (no intervention) control group. We will additionally explore whether there is an intervention effect on biomarkers of brain health using structural neuroimaging methods (exploratory Aim 4). The following measures will be used to test the hypotheses associated with each aim. A detailed description of each measure is provided below. A demographic questionnaire will be administered only at baseline that captures basic data including age, gender, race, educational history, occupational history, medical history, and psychiatric history.

Outcome measures

The following instruments will be administered at baseline (pre-intervention), immediately post intervention, and 3- and 6-months post intervention (see Table 4).

### Healthy housing reference manual [^112dionR]. CDC (2006). Medium credibility.

Pool content turnover rate — definition, 6-hour standard, and calculation are detailed. The turnover rate is the number of times a pool's contents can be filtered though its filtration equipment in a 24-hour period, and a 6-hour turnover rate will result in 98% clarification if the pool is properly designed. A typical-use pool should have a pump and filtration system capable of pumping the entire contents of the pool though the filters every 6 hours; to determine compliance, use Turnover rate = pool volume (gallons)/flow rate×60 (minutes in hour). A sample calculation shows Turnover rate = 90,000 (gallons in pool)/ 180 gallons per minute×60 (minutes in hour), yielding an 8.3-hour turnover rate = 90,000 (pool volume in gallons)/10,800, which would not meet the required turnover rate of 6 hours.

### Role of the intensity of habitual physical activity in the maintenance of normal blood pressure: findings from the SUN longitudinal cohort study [^114wD8pm]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

The baseline questionnaire asked, "How much do you usually walk each day?" (answer choices: < 10 minutes/10–20 minutes/21–30 minutes/30 minutes–1 hour/1–2 hours/ > 2 hours) and "How many flights of stairs do you climb each day?" (≤ 2/3–4/5–9/10–14/ ≥ 15). We converted the number of flights of stairs into time climbing stairs (≤ 2 flights = 30 s, 3–4 flights = 1 minute 45 s, 5–9 flights = 3 minutes 30 s, 10–14 flights = 6 minutes, ≥ 15 flights = 8 minutes 45 s).

The question set used to assess LTPA has been validated in our cohort. Participants were asked, "Do you exercise?" (yes/no), then directed to complete a 17‐item LTPA question set titled, "During the last year, how much time on average did you spend doing the following activities?". Specified activities were "walking"; "jogging"; "running"; "cycling"; "stationary bike"; "swimming"; "racket sports"; "soccer and indoor soccer"; "other team sports (eg, basketball, handball)"; "dance and aerobics"; "hiking and rock‐climbing"; "gym‐based work outs": "gardening, yard maintenance, pool maintenance and renovations"; "skiing, ice‐skating and rollerblading"; "judo, karate and martial arts"; "sailing" and "other sports or activities not listed". The seasonal variation of LTPA was also taken into account: for each activity, participants answered, "Average time per week" (Never/1–4 minutes/5–19 minutes/20–59 minutes/ < 1 hour/1–1.5 hours/2–3 hours/4–6 hours/7–10 hours/ ≥ 11 hours) as well as "Months per year" (< 3 months/3–6 months/ > 6 months). Reported time per week was multiplied by 0.125 for < 3 months, or 0.375 for 3 to 6 months, or 0.75 for > 6 months. Nonresponse for an activity was interpreted as nonparticipation, whereas partial response — that is, answering only "hours per week" or "months per year" but not both — was considered an incomplete answer. Participants with incomplete data for incidental PA or LTPA were excluded from the analysis. PA data were explored for plausibility and no data were identified as implausible.

Self-reported measure

Self-reported PA

The measurement of PA will be based on the following questions: 'Over the past 7 days, how many days were you physically active for a total of at least 60 minutes per day?'. Response options will range from 0 to 7 days per week in 1-day increments. PA will be defined as less than 60 min of PA per day on at least 7 days per week. Also, the measurement of vigorous PA activities will be based on the following question: 'Outside school hours: how often do you usually exercise in your free time so much that you get out of breath or sweat?' The response choices ranged from every day to never.

Self-reported SB

SB will be based on the following questions: How many hours a day, in your free time, do you usually spend watching TV, videos, DVDs and other entertainment on a screen?, How many hours a day in your free time, do you usually spend playing games on a computer, games console, tablet (like iPad) or smartphone or other electronic devices (not only including moving or fitness games)?, How many hours a day, in your free time, do you usually spend using electronic devices such as computers, tablets (like iPad) or smartphones for other purposes, for example, homework, emailing, tweeting, Facebook, chatting, surfing the internet?The total daily sedentary screen time will be determined by summing the durations of various daily screen time activities. Additionally, total screen time for both weekdays and weekends will be calculated.

Self-reported sleep time

Sleep time will be based on the following question: 'How many hours do you usually sleep per day on average (including sleep at night and during the day?'

### Improving door to CT scanner times for potential stroke thrombolysis candidates-the emergency department's role [^111BUjcg]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

Stroke thrombolysis is an important treatment in the management of acute strokes. Its' effectiveness is reliant on prompt administration after stroke onset. Disability free survival at 3–6 months increases by 10% when administered within 3 hours. There is also an economic benefit from early administration with reduced institutional care. New Scottish care standards have been introduced which suggest a target that 50% of suitable patients should receive thrombolysis within 30 minutes, and 80% within one hour.

Processes in the Emergency Department play a key role in determining the time a patient waits between arrival and reaching the CT scanner. The project team looked at Ninewells Emergency Department times to CT scanner between May and August 2015 and found that only 20% of patients had their scan within 20 minutes, and 70% within 45 minutes. The team went on to conduct a quality improvement project. This involved initial patient mapping and short interviews with staff. A multi action approach was developed involving education in the form of emails, presentations and visual charts, and the final step was to simplify the paperwork involved. The project was conducted over 11 months and successfully reduced the times to CT, with 60% having had their CT scan within 20 minutes, and 100% within 45 minutes, with a very noticeable reduction in variation around the mean. It is hoped to take this approach forward and apply it to other processes in the department.

### Joint consensus statement of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine and sleep research society on the recommended amount of sleep for a healthy adult: methodology and discussion [^116gdZmn]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Recommended amount of sleep for a healthy adult — future directions specify "five specific areas for future research consideration", including: 1) "Improved sleep duration measures and study designs", where studies "should include objective measures of sleep when possible, well-validated self-report measures, and ecologically valid study designs", and epidemiology "would benefit from using home polysomnography, actigraphy, or other novel objective methods"; laboratory work is "needed that systematically vary sleep opportunity in discrete steps between doses of 6 hours and 8 hours", and "should examine relevant time periods (e.g., 30 days)" and "more systematically mimic the more typical lifestyle of cycling through doses of shorter (restricted) and longer (extended) sleep opportunities". 2) "Investigate downstream mechanisms linking habitual sleep duration to health and functioning", with "Intervention studies [that] could also help to clarify whether modifying sleep improves health outcomes". 3) "Better delineate the upstream physiologic, behavioral, social, and environmental factors that may play a role in sleep duration and health outcomes". 4) "Develop intervention studies", since we "do not yet know whether habitual sleep duration can be modified in the real world", so "a systematic approach, moving from treatment development studies, to efficacy studies, to large-scale pragmatic trials, is warranted".

### Improving door to CT scanner times for potential stroke thrombolysis candidates-the emergency department's role [^112WRSNd]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

Results

A total of 73 patients were included in the project. 20 prior to project, and 53 throughout the PDSA cycles. The mean time to CT had reduced from 45 minutes to 22 minutes from start to end of project. There was an improvement from 20 to 45% in patients reaching the CT scanner within 20 minutes, after education, and this improved further to 60% after new paperwork was brought in [see Figure 2]. There was also an improvement in the percentage of patients reaching the scanner within 45 minutes from 70% pre-project, to 94% post education, and 100% post paperwork introduction. This improvement could potentially then allow Ninewells hospital to meet the new Scottish stroke care standard targets for time to thrombolysis within the 30 minutes and 1 hour windows.

Figure 2
Percentage of patients completing scan within 20, 30 and 45 minutes of arrival in the department

To aid interpretation of the results a run chart was plotted [see Figure 1]. This showed that the biggest shift in the process was with increased staff awareness at PDSA1. There were fewer runs as the project went on, and few enough to suggest a statistically significant change. All of the astronomical points had their notes reviewed and found to have valid reasons for increased time such as hypertensive patients requiring management, or seizure management, and one case was when junior doctors first stepped up to the senior doctor role, and were unfamiliar with the process/ paperwork. Perhaps this is an area for review, to ensure they have shadowed established senior members of staff more often prior to taking on initial stroke assessment in thrombolysis cases.

Figure 1
Run chart of results

The data would suggest that there was no significant difference between patients seen at weekends, overnight or within normal working hours, and all time periods saw an improvement [see Figure 3].

### Interviewing children: the impact of the COVID-19 quarantine on children's perceived psychological distress and changes in routine [^116GboRt]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Results

Socio-demographic characteristics of the sample

In total 82 children and adolescents, aged 6 to 14 (mean age of 10.4 years) were interviewed; of whom 53.7% were males and 46.3% were females.

Just over half of students (54.9%) went to primary school and 45.1% to middle school. Most (72%) were attending public schools.

All students were living in Milan (Italy). In particular, 53 (64.6%) were living in the urban area of Milan, while 29 (35.4%) in the metropolitan area. A minority of the students (11%) had specific learning disorders or special educational needs. Most (89%) had brothers or sisters; the majority of them (78%) had parents who were working during the lockdown. 68.3% of the subjects spent less than 2 h per day on leisure screen time, but 26 respondents (31.7%) reported spending more than two hours a day in front of screens, excluding hours of online lessons and homework.

Of the 82 children and adolescents who participated in the study, 3 (3.6%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 virus and 12(14.6%) had close relatives who had been infected. This means that 7 respondents had been exposed to COVID-19 without contracting the disease.

### "From the moment I wake up I will use it… every day, very hour": a qualitative study on the patterns of adolescents' mobile touch screen device use from adolescent and parent perspectives [^115UE9CJ]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

"It's more of an interval thing… open [phone] check then close, open check close… [almost] every other minute, each time less than even three minutes. Just a simple check then close". (A23).

Many parents also agreed with their adolescents in their adolescents' frequent use of MTSDs; they reported that their adolescents seemed to always have their MTSDs with them, using them almost the whole time whenever possible:

"She is using her mobile most of the time. So, [whenever] I see her, the mobile phone usually will not leave her… just like [it is] attached to her every time [I see her]". (P15–16).

(ii) Ubiquitous use

The use of MTSDs by adolescents was ubiquitous; at various locations at home, in school and in the community when outdoors, bringing them almost wherever they were and having them often within reach. At home, adolescents used MTSDs at various places, such as on the sofa or dining table, in the living room or kitchen, on the study table or in bed in the bedroom, and even in the toilet, which were similarly noted by their parents too:

"Every other minute they will not go anywhere without the phone, even from the room to the hall to the kitchen… anywhere in the house he moves, the phone moves with him". (P28).

In school, whether in the assembly hall before school starts, the classroom during or in between lessons, or in the canteen during recess or lunch time, they also used MTSDs. When outdoors in the community, for example when commuting in public transport, in cars or when walking to and from school or other places, and when out with family and friends (e.g. shopping centres or restaurants), they also often used MTSDs. At home, many adolescents tended to use MTSDs for longer periods as they had more free time available and were not occupied with school lessons or other activities. In school and in the community, use tended to be intermittent in shorter bouts, during breaks or any free time that was available when they go about their activities; for example, before start of morning school assembly, when commuting or whilst waiting (e.g. for food to arrive when dining out or parents to finish their shopping errands).

### Total workload and recovery in relation to worktime reduction: a randomised controlled intervention study with time-use data [^115nDmhX]. Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

It has been suggested that the beneficial effects of worktime reduction might be explained by increased time for recovery and social activities. However, to retrospectively estimate time spent in specific activities in questionnaires may give inaccurate estimates, and an alternative measurement strategy would be to collect time-use data through activity reporting sheets in diaries. The present paper is the first to investigate whether total workload (including both paid and non-paid work) decreases and recovery time increases when work hours are reduced. It is thus hypothesised that the worktime reduction results in diminished total workload and increased time for recovery activities during workdays. However, there may be individual differences in how the additional free time is used. For example, if the extra time is used for non-paid work, total workload and recovery time might be the same as before the intervention. Hence, differences in relation to gender and family situation, for example having children living at home (yes/no), sharing household with a partner (yes/no) and living alone with children (yes/no), were also explored. Time-use patterns were investigated also on days off.

### Fatigue risk management in the workplace [^116kMtaf]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

Circadian sleep physiology in adults indicates typical sleep need and timing. Most individuals require between 7 and 8 hours of sleep per night to be fully alert, although some require only 6 hours, and others may require as many as 10 hours per night. Humans operate on a daily cycle that is generally slightly longer than 24 hours, with sleep drive reaching a peak in the early morning hours and a small increase in the early to midafternoon.

### Assessment of potential myopia risk factors, including chronotype, in Estonian adolescents: a cross-sectional study [^116cBf9d]. BMC Ophthalmology (2024). Medium credibility.

A set of questions were administered to the participants to analyse their daily activities. The activities defined as near work and intermediate distance work were defined based on the study by Rose et al. In their study, near work activities included drawing, homework, reading, and handheld computer use. Intermediate distance activities were a sum of watching television, playing video games and using the computer. The English translations of the questions used in this study are: (1) How many hours do you spend outdoors? (2) How many hours do you spend doing near work (for example, reading, writing, using a mobile phone or a tablet)? (3) How many hours do you spend using the computer? (4) How many hours do you spend watching the TV and/or playing video games? Questions 3 and 4 were summed to get the value for intermediate viewing distance activities. These four questions were asked separately for school days and free days. The total time per week was calculated and used in the analysis. While this set of questions has not undergone formal validation in the context of comparing self-reported data to objective measures, we took care to ensure that the questions were clear and comprehensively captured the key activities previously defined in studies on near work and intermediate distance work. Furthermore, while self-reporting is known to introduce both random and non-random errors, we do not have reason to believe that these errors would systematically differ between myopes and non-myopes, thus minimising the risk of introducing systematic reporting bias.

### Association between physical activity and risk of depression: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1114QGcn]. JAMA Psychiatry (2022). High credibility.

Physical Activity Exposure Harmonization

We harmonized reported exposure levels to a common metric of physical activity volume in marginal metabolic equivalent task hours per week (mMET-h/wk), reflecting the energy expended above the resting metabolic rate (1 MET). Combinations of harmonization techniques were used depending on what was reported or obtained from authors and availability of validation work (details of the original exposure data, harmonization methods, and harmonization flowchart are available in an Open Science Frameworkrepository).

Frequency, Duration, and Intensity Assumptions

Studies that described physical activity exposure as frequency and duration were converted to a measure of weekly duration. If session duration was not provided, a session duration of 0.75 hours was assumed. Weekly durations were then converted to activity volume in mMET hours per week by multiplying by intensity values of 1.5 mMET for light, 3.5 mMET for moderate and moderate to vigorous, and 7.0 mMET for vigorous physical activity. A score of 3.5 mMET corresponds to the midpoint of the range for moderate-intensity activity (≥ 2 to < 5 mMETs). Vigorous was scored at 7 mMET because activity of this intensity contributes twice as much toward meeting physical activity guidelines compared with moderate activity (the World Health Organization advises 150–300 minutes of moderate intensity activity or 75–150 minutes of vigorous intensity activity per week). Light activities are those in the range of 0.5 to 2 mMETs; however, these were scored slightly higher than the midpoint at 1.5 mMET to reflect the intensity of behaviors commonly referred to as light activity in questionnaires (eg, light housework, light gardening).

Converting Energy Expenditure to MET Units

One study reported energy expenditure without adjustment for body weight (kcal/wk). Weight was calculated using body mass index and height from national survey data. The exposure in kcal per week was then divided by derived weight and further converted to MET hours using 1 kcal/kg = 1 MET hour.

Removing the Resting Energy Expenditure Component of Physical Activity

For studies reporting physical activity volume and corresponding duration data, 1 MET hour per week was subtracted for each hour of activity undertaken; this is equivalent to the original studies having multiplied activity duration with net (mMET) rather than gross (MET) intensity values. If duration for each volume level was not reported or obtainable from authors, we used a prediction equation derived from studies where both volume and duration were available (eMethods 3 in the Supplement).

### Computer and furniture affecting musculoskeletal problems and work performance in work from home during COVID-19 pandemic [^116wQUNn]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

RESULTS

A total of 4711 homeworkers completed the questionnaires (response rate, 58.9%). Among these, 4112 questionnaires from 1930 males and 2182 females were included in the analysis.

Baseline Characteristics of Homeworkers

Table 1 provides the baseline characteristics of homeworkers. Most homeworkers (39.1%) were in the 40- to 49-year-old age group. Those belonging to the younger than 40-year group accounted for 26.3%, while those older than 50 years comprised 34.7%. In terms of working time, 31.3% reported working more than 7 hours but less than or equal to 8 hours, 25.3% reported working less than or equal to 7 hours, 22.6% reported working more than 9 hours, and 20.8% reported working more than 8 hours but less than 9 hours. The average working time was 8.37 ± 1.8 hours per day, whereas the prescribed working time in the company was only 7 hours. Most respondents (58.9%) reported having 1 or 2 breaks per hour. Twenty-eight percent reported no break time during WFH (28.0%), and 1.8% had more than 5 breaks per hour. In terms of WFH frequency, half of respondents (65.7%) reported having 4 or more days of WFH per week, and only 8.3% reported less than 2 days. Body height, weight, and job description are listed in Table 1.

### Comparing the acute effects of shiftwork on mothers and fathers [^111Wqf9b]. Occupational Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Figure 1.
The process of categorizing participants with respect to their work schedule.

Work schedule was ascertained by asking respondents about their normal working hours. Response options were daywork (~ 6.00 a.m.–6.00 p.m.), evening work (~ 6.00 p.m.–10 p.m.), nightwork (~ 6.00 p.m.–6.00 a.m.), two-shift shift work, three-shift shift work, rostered work (i.e. following an ad hoc duty rota) without nightshifts, rostered work including nightshifts, discretionary/unregulated working hours and other. Participants included in the current analyses were classified as undertaking either daywork, shift work with nights (either nightwork, three-shift shift work or rostered work including nights) or shift work without nights (two-shift shift work or rostered work without nights).

Gender was obtained from registers linked to questionnaire responses by means of the unique Swedish 10-digit personal identification numbers. Presence of children under 13 years at home was determined from a series of items asking about the number and ages of any children at home, from which participants were categorized as having either at least one child at home under 13 years or as none.

Age (at the end of the year during which the baseline questionnaire was completed) was also obtained from registers. Educational level was determined from registers indicating the respondents' highest level of education attained, categorized as < 3 years of higher education or ≥ 3 years of higher education. Employment status was self-reported, with participants categorized as working either full-time or part-time.

Sleep disturbance, mental fatigue and sleep insufficiency were measured with items from the Karolinska Sleep Questionnaire, which assesses sleep problems experienced in the last 3 months. Sleep disturbance was calculated as the mean of four items assessing the frequencies of: difficulty falling asleep, disturbed sleep, premature awakening and repeated awakenings; while a fifth item measured the frequency of experiencing mental fatigue (1: never; 6: always/five times a week). Sleep insufficiency was based on a single item asking whether the respondent felt that they got enough sleep (1: yes, definitely enough; 5: no, far from enough).

### How much activity do youth get? A quantitative review of heart-rate measured activity [^114YV64L]. Pediatrics (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

Recommendations for adult physical activity have shifted from 20 to 60 minutes of continuous vigorous activity 3 to 5 times a week to accumulation of 30 minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity most days of the week. Variations of these guidelines also have been suggested for children, based on the idea of accumulating moderate to vigorous physical activity throughout the day, rather than attaining vigorous physical activity in continuous blocks. The goal of this study was to assess accumulated amounts of physical activity at different intensities in children.

Methods

We reviewed 26 studies (n = 1883) in youth aged 3 to 17 years that used heart-rate recording to measure physical activity in children to determine accumulated daily activity. Included were studies that provided time being active for at least 2 heart rate intensities at or above 120 beats/minute. Descriptive characteristics of the study groups were determined, and the influence of age, gender, and hours and days of observation on the slope of activity time as a function of percentage of heart rate reserve (HRR) was determined using hierarchical linear regression.

Results

Youth attained 128.0 ± 45.6, 47.1 ± 14.9, 29.3 ± 13.7, and 14.7 ± 6.0 minutes/day between 20% to 40%, 40% to 50%, 50% to 60%, and greater than 60% HRR, respectively. Age was a significant predictor of the intercept and slope of the physical activity and %HRR relationship.

Conclusion

Youth of all ages attain > 60 minutes/day of low-intensity physical activity and approximately 30 minutes/day of activity at traditional cardiovascular fitness training levels of 50% or more of HRR. Recommendations for youth activity are discussed.

### Total workload and recovery in relation to worktime reduction: a randomised controlled intervention study with time-use data [^111N1sVP]. Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Figure 1
Activity reporting sheet.

These predefined activities were then divided into four different groups based on the type of activity: (1) paid work (including labour work at the office or at home), (2) non-paid work (including household work, care of own children and care of others), (3) total workload (the sum of paid and non-paid work), and (4) recovery activities (including personal care, meals, rest, leisure time, social activities, own time and daytime sleep). This division is based on the following arguments: first, we wanted to sort out activities that were not related to work (eg, recovery activities vs total workload). Second, we wanted to separate activities outside paid work that might enhance recovery (recovery activities) and activities that might hinder recovery opportunities (non-paid work). All groups of activities were mapped out (see figure 1) and calculated in terms of average number of hours per day on workdays and days off separately. Days of sickness absence were consequently not included in the data analyses. Every measurement week included 7 (days)×39 (half-hours)×636 (individuals) = 173 628 data points. Data were coded as missing if the rate of missing activities for 1 day exceeded 25% (more than 10 missing activities out of 39). The average rate of internal missing at baseline was 5.4% (3.0% among completers and 30.6% among those who later on dropped off). At the 9-month follow-up, it was 3.0% and at the 18-month follow-up 2.9%.

The SKAMP-Combined score, measured at 0.75, 2, 4, 8, 10, 12, and 13 hours post-dose during the laboratory classroom day at the end of the double-blind treatment period, was used to assess the primary and the key secondary efficacy parameters. The primary efficacy endpoint was the average of treatment effects across all the time points as specified above during the classroom day. The key secondary efficacy parameters were onset and duration of clinical effect. QuilliChew ER was statistically significantly superior to placebo with respect to the primary endpoint (Table 2). QuilliChew ER also showed improvement over placebo at 0.75, 2, 4, and 8 hours post-dosing. Efficacy results at each time point are summarized in Figure 3.

### Permanent standard time is the optimal choice for health and safety: an American Academy of Sleep Medicine position statement [^112ngwB3]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Chronic effects of daylight saving time (DST) — naturalistic comparisons within single time zones where solar exposure differs indicate that an extra hour of evening natural light is linked to reduced sleep and other harms: in the United States, solar light/dark exposure differs by about 1 hour or more, an extra hour of natural light in the evening reduced sleep duration chronically by an average of 19 minutes and increased self-reported insufficient sleep; westward position shows increased cancer risk with even a 5° westward position, and economic models indicate productivity losses equivalent to 4.4 million lost days of work. Under DST, chronic misalignment between internal circadian timing and social schedules results in significant sleep differences between workdays and days off ("social jet lag"); adolescents and young adults are most impacted due to later bed/wake times and longer sleep needs, and persistent, augmented social jet lag and mood disturbance have been demonstrated with permanent DST, with those having an evening chronotype potentially more impacted.

### Association between developmental dyslexia and anxiety / depressive symptoms among children in China: the chain mediating of time spent on homework and stress [^115Cp9PV]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

The relationship between dyslexia and anxiety/depressive symptoms among children in China is unclear. Besides, the pathways to explain the risks are also undefined.

Methods

3993 primary school students from grade 2 to 6 were recruited in this study. The Dyslexia Checklist for Chinese Children and the Pupil Rating Scale-Revised Screening for Learning Disabilities were used to filter the dyslexic children. The Chinese perceived stress scale, the Screen for Child Anxiety Related Emotional Disorders, and the Children's Depression Inventory-Short Form were used separately to assess stress, anxiety symptoms, and depressive symptoms of the children. Time spent on homework was obtained by asking their parents: "How long does it take the children to complete the homework every day?". The chain mediation models were examined using SPSS PROCESS macro 3.3 software.

Results

Dyslexic children spend more time on homework (2.61 ± 1.15), and have higher scores for depression (4.75 ± 3.60) and stress (26.55 ± 7.40) compared to normal children (1.87 ± 0.77, 3.25 ± 3.32, and 23.20 ± 8.43, respectively). The differences are statistically significant (all P < 0.01). There is no direct association between dyslexia and anxiety symptoms, while dyslexia has a direct link with depressive symptoms. Dyslexia could affect anxiety/depressive symptoms via the independent mediating effect of stress and the chain mediating effect of time spent on homework and stress. The total indirect effect is 0.21 and 0.25, respectively.

Limitations

The data used in our study is self-reported and this is a cross-sectional study.

Conclusions

Time spent on homework and stress could mediate the association between dyslexia and anxiety/depressive symptoms.

### Time for self-care: downtime recovery as a buffer of work and home / family time pressures [^114iUsKt]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

Opportunities for people to recover from stress are insufficient, because demanding and excessive life activities leave little time for recovery. Downtime is a self-care behavior that can occur in any life domain (ie, work, home/family, leisure).

Methods

Using survey data from a cross-section of 422 U.S. workers, we tested hypotheses regarding downtime as a buffer of the effects of time pressure and whether downtime's benefits were related to the domain in which it was taken, or influenced by perceived time control.

Results

In situations of high time pressure, work and home/family downtime were beneficial when time control was high, while relaxing leisure was beneficial when time control was low.

Conclusions

Downtime is available whenever people recognize their need for recovery and respond by entering a state of physical relaxation and psychological detachment from stressors.

### Joint consensus statement of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine and sleep research society on the recommended amount of sleep for a healthy adult: methodology and discussion [^1111k9WH]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Recommended amount of sleep for a healthy adult — measurement considerations and ecological validity emphasize that real-world sleep patterns can produce circadian disruption "equivalent to taking a 2–3 hour "flight" westward on Friday night… only to "fly" back on Sunday night — waking earlier than desired Monday morning". The panel notes "the heterogeneity of sleep duration measurement", with "retrospective self-report, the most common method in epidemiologic studies and in clinical practice", that is easy but limited as "sleep duration can vary substantially over time", questions "may capture time in bed rather than time asleep", and "self-reported sleep duration often differs considerably from objective measures". Among objective tools, "Actigraphy has better sensitivity (detecting sleep) than specificity (detecting wake)" and "often overestimates sleep duration", while "PSG is the only common method that directly measures brain activity", yet is "more intrusive… may interfere with the very thing it measures", is "expensive and less well-suited" for large, home, or multi-night studies; emerging "consumer sleep technologies may create opportunities for accurate, reliable, scalable objective sleep duration assessment".

### Midodrine hydrochloride [^114pkY4M]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

In a 2-day study, after open-label midodrine, known midodrine responders received midodrine 10 mg or placebo at 0, 3, and 6 hours. One-minute standing systolic blood pressures were increased 1 hour after each dose by about 15 mmHg and 3 hours after each dose by about 12mmHg; 3-minute standing pressures were increased also at 1, but not 3, hours after dosing. There were increases in standing time seen intermittently 1 hour after dosing, but not at 3 hours.

In a 1-day, dose-response trial, single doses of 0, 2.5, 10, and 20 mg of midodrine were given to 25 patients. The 10- and 20-mg doses produced increases in standing 1- minute systolic pressure of about 30 mmHg at 1 hour; the increase was sustained in part for 2 hours after 10 mg and 4 hours after 20 mg. Supine systolic pressure was ≥ 200 mmHg in 22% of patients on 10mg and 45% of patients on 20 mg; elevated pressures often lasted 6 hours or more.

Special Populations

A study with 16 patients undergoing hemodialysis demonstrated that Midodrine hydrochloride is removed by dialysis.

### Total workload and recovery in relation to worktime reduction: a randomised controlled intervention study with time-use data [^114rPa7s]. Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Measurements and outcomes

The questionnaire data included questions on demographic data and work situation, including questions of work environment exposure evaluated through job demands (1, low demands–4, high demands) and job control (1, low control–4, high control).

Time-use recordings were adapted by a methodology developed at Statistics Sweden, where the activity reporting sheets include 10 min intervals and participants should freely register activities during 1 weekday and 1 day during the weekend. The activities are then coded into 99 different types of activities. They are further classified into 24 categories, which in turn are divided into five main groups of activities: paid work, domestic work, studies, personal needs and free time.

Because of the high burden during the data collections in this present study, the activity reporting sheets developed here were divided into intervals of 30 min, from 06:00 to 01:00 the next night, every day during 1 week per measurement period. There were 13 predefined activities that the participants could register: work, work performed at home, household work, care of own children, care of others, personal care, meals, sleep, rest, leisure time, social activities, own time and other. Sleep reported between 08:30 and 21:30 was labelled daytime sleep. The activity 'other' was not used in this study. This resulted in 12 categories, which are defined and presented in figure 1.

### Total workload and recovery in relation to worktime reduction: a randomised controlled intervention study with time-use data [^114nXPKN]. Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Statistical analyses

Mean values for workdays and days off for the different categories of the time-use data were studied with multilevel modelling. A value of the intraclass correlation (ICC) of workplace was calculated for each variable at baseline. Although the values of ICC were low (ranging from 0.000 to 0.130 for the activities on workdays and from 0.000 to 0.023 on days off), they were taken into consideration in all statistical analyses, which were based on multilevel mixed models including random effects for workplace at level 2.

The model included the outcome variable and the fixed effects of the between-group factor group (intervention vs control; level 2), the within-group factor time (baseline, 9 months and 18 months; level 1), and the interaction between group and time. The models were fitted by modelling the autocorrelation and adjusted by educational level and working shift (yes/no), since the groups differed in these parameters at baseline. The autocorrelation residuals (as indicated by r) ranged from −0.238 to 0.228 for the activities on workdays and from −0.011 to 0.245 on days off. Contrast coefficients were calculated by group in order to evaluate the effects by time period (baseline vs 9-month follow-up and 9-month vs 18-month follow-up).

Sensitivity analyses (eg, excluding the eight participants who had 1 day off per week instead of having shorter workdays) were made since those two types of worktime reduction influence time-use patterns differently. Moreover, sensitivity analyses, by excluding the workplace that was not randomised, were made in order to rule out possible bias due to the randomisation procedure.

The subgroup analysis of gender was made by adding a second between-group factor (gender) into the model, resulting in several two-way interactions and one three-way interaction of group×time×gender. Additional subgroup analyses of having children living at home (yes/no), living with a partner (yes/no), living alone with children (yes/no), working area (social services/technical services/care and welfare/call centre) and working shift (yes/no) were also performed. Shift workers were defined as employees reporting normal work hours during evening and/or night in the questionnaire at all three measurement periods.

### Total workload and recovery in relation to worktime reduction: a randomised controlled intervention study with time-use data [^116PiUB5]. Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Participants worked at 33 different workplaces (including 3–68 participants per workplace), in four working sectors: social services, n = 170; technical services, n = 236; care and welfare, n = 159; and call centre, n = 71. Almost one-third were shift workers, most of the participants were women, and the average age was M = 44.2 years, SD = 10.9 years (range between 20 and 65 years). Half of the participants reported they had children living at home. About 75% reported they lived with a partner and about 5% were single parents living alone with children. Background variables are presented in table 1. In the intervention group, there were 33 individuals who worked 4 days a week and had no reduction of daily work hours at the 9-month follow-up. At the 18-month follow-up, there were 35 such individuals. However, only eight participants worked shorter workweeks at both occasions instead of reducing the daily worktime. They were consequently excluded in a sensitivity analysis.

Table 1
Descriptive data at baseline presented by group

T-tests showed no age difference or differences in level of job demand or job control between groups (table 1). The number of reported hours of paid work, non-paid work, total workload and recovery activities on workdays or on days off did not differ between groups at baseline (P = 0.133–0.764), except for recovery on days off (t = 2.94; P = 0.003). The intervention group reported somewhat more time in recovery activities on days off as compared with the control group at baseline. Moreover, χ² tests indicated differences between groups in two of the background variables presented in table 1: educational level (university level; yes/no) and working shift (yes/no), which were consequently added as covariates in the statistical models.

### Measuring up: musings of a family doctor on the employee time clock [^111m2osS]. Annals of Family Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Recently, at the health maintenance organization (HMO) where I work, they introduced an employee time clock. As in many other workplaces, doctors across the country are now obligated to punch the clock at the beginning and end of their workday. This is the final act in an ongoing attempt to enhance management of doctors' schedules: limit nonurgent appointments to 10 minutes, define planned or urgent home visits, and control a physician's time, as well as managerial and clinical decisions. In this story I describe a day in the life of a family doctor, a salaried employee at a large HMO where there is now a time clock. I provide details on how the introduction of the clock influences small everyday clinical decisions that potentially affect the quality and depth of treatment while sharing the internal dialogue that accompanies me as I reaffirm my professional integrity again and again with each hastened visit. I also bring the internal dialogue of 2 of my patients, to illustrate the emotional world on the other side of these 10-minute interventions.

### Association of work-related psychosocial factors and day-to-day home blood pressure variation: the finn-home study [^1111AqiR]. Journal of Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

Work-related psychosocial factors

Job strain was measured with a modified version of the Job Content Questionnaire. The following job demands items were used: 'My job requires working very fast'; 'My job requires working very hard'; 'I am not asked to do an excessive amount of work'; 'I have enough time to get my job done'; and 'My job includes conflicting demands'. The following job control items were used: 'My job allows me to make a lot of decisions on my own'; 'My job requires me to be creative'; 'My job requires that I learn new things'; 'My job involves a lot of repetitive work'; 'I have a lot of control over what happens at my job'; 'My job requires a high level of skill'; 'I get to do a variety of different things on my job'; 'I have an opportunity to develop my own special abilities'; and 'On my job, I am given a lot of freedom to decide how I do my work'. All items had a 5-point response scale, ranging from 'I completely agree' to 'I completely disagree'. The participants were divided into high vs. low demands and high vs. low control based on median scores in the entire Health 2000 Study sample (3.20 for demands and 3.78 for control). The presence of high job strain was defined as having high demands (above the median) and low control (below the median). All other participants were included in the low job strain group.

Covariates

Educational level was self-reported and classified as low, intermediate or high. Occupational status was classified as nonmanual (soldiers, directors and superior civil servants, specialists, experts, office and client service workers, service employees, sales and care workers), manual (farmers, foresters, construction, repair and craft workers and process and transport workers), and other workers. BMI was calculated from the measured weight and height. Information on physical activity, alcohol use and smoking was collected in a questionnaire. Self-reported leisure-time physical activity was classified into three categories based on the volume of activity: low, medium, and high. Alcohol use was categorized as risk-use or not (≥ 288 g per week for men, ≥ 192 g per week for women). Smoking status was classified as current smoker (daily or less often) and nonsmoker (never and former).

### Expanding developmental and behavioral health capacity in pediatric primary care [^116kWG32]. Clinical Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Prior to DBAC's launch, the general pediatrician completed the REACH Institute's16.25-hour "mini-fellowship" in pediatric psychopharmacology and a 34.5-hour Developmental-Behavioral Pediatric Board Review Course (DB:PREP)sponsored by the American Academy of Pediatrics. The DBAC clinician also received training in the following developmental testing tools: the Capute Scales for cognitive and language delay in children aged 0 to 36 months, the Screening Tool for Autism in Toddlers & Young Children (STAT), the Bracken School Readiness Assessment, 3rd Edition (BRSA-3) to assess school-readiness skills in children aged 3 to 6, and the Wide Range Achievement Test, 5th Edition (WRAT-5) for youth in grades kindergarten through 12 to monitor reading, spelling, and math skills. All of these assessments were designed to take less than 30 minutes of face-to-face time and were only available at an in-office visit. For the first 3 months of the pilot study, the DBAC clinician also consulted by telephone with her DBP proctor for each DBAC case. After this initial period, the frequency of consultation decreased substantially, but still occurred intermittently when the general pediatrician had questions regarding diagnosis or treatment planning for DBAC patients.

DBAC started with a half-day clinic session per week co-located in the primary care clinic; due to demand, this expanded to a full-day clinic per week after 6 months. The COVID-19 pandemic forced a temporary closure of in-person clinic sessions, as services rapidly converted to telehealth platforms. Currently, DBAC operates on-site at the primary care clinic for a half-day session per week and by off-site telehealth for an additional 1 to 2 half-day sessions every week. New patient visits are 60 minutes and follow-up visits are 30 minutes; time-based billing is used. The DBAC clinician also provides informal consultation to other general pediatric attendings and regular teaching for pediatric residents.

### Time well spent? Relating television use to children's free-time activities [^11451LCn]. Pediatrics (2006). Low credibility.

Objectives

This study assessed the claim that children's television use interferes with time spent in more developmentally appropriate activities.

Methods

Data came from the first wave of the Child Development Supplement, a nationally representative sample of children aged 0 to 12 in 1997 (N = 1712). Twenty-four-hour time-use diaries from 1 randomly chosen weekday and 1 randomly chosen weekend day were used to assess children's time spent watching television, time spent with parents, time spent with siblings, time spent reading (or being read to), time spent doing homework, time spent in creative play, and time spent in active play. Ordinary least squares multiple regression was used to assess the relationship between children's television use and time spent pursuing other activities.

Results

Results indicated that time spent watching television both with and without parents or siblings was negatively related to time spent with parents or siblings, respectively, in other activities. Television viewing also was negatively related to time spent doing homework for 7- to 12-year-olds and negatively related to creative play, especially among very young children (younger than 5 years). There was no relationship between time spent watching television and time spent reading (or being read to) or to time spent in active play.

Conclusions

The results of this study are among the first to provide empirical support for the assumptions made by the American Academy of Pediatrics in their screen time recommendations. Time spent viewing television both with and without parents and siblings present was strongly negatively related to time spent interacting with parents or siblings. Television viewing was associated with decreased homework time and decreased time in creative play. Conversely, there was no support for the widespread belief that television interferes with time spent reading or in active play.

Position statement: daylight saving time — future directions note that although the acute, adverse effects of DST are well-described, few studies have evaluated the chronic effects of DST on physiology, performance, health, economics and safety; such studies should attempt to address confounding seasonal effects, including the length of the photoperiod; more studies are needed to determine how eastward or westward position in a time zone influences health and safety outcomes; and studies that compare the impacts of permanent standard time to permanent DST are also needed.

The final phase of the recruitment effort is to make sure that the candidate fulfills the needs of the group and to try to make as sure as possible that the candidate would be happy in the new position. This means there must be a very candid exchange of information regarding the goals and expectations of the group and the individual, and how the group's expectations will be measured. It also means making sure that there is a good fit between the culture of the group and the desires of the candidate. Furthermore, a substantial effort should be made to make sure the candidate (and his family) will be happy in the practice location.

### A mixed-methods study of challenges experienced by clinical teams in measuring improvement [^111pC9sb]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2021). High credibility.

It would have been great to have someone with data analysis skills, or someone from our informatics team who was dedicated to (our project). We've used up a lot of our teams' time learning where different bits are kept. (Interview, main phase)

In some cases, appropriate analysis was not possible because of basic weaknesses in the measures or data recording, for example, when the definitions used were so poorly specified that it was not clear exactly what was being measured. For instance, in measuring the time from admission to the diagnostic test being done, one team recorded the time but not the date of the test. It was therefore impossible to distinguish whether the test had taken, for example, 4 or 28 hours.

Analysis was also severely hindered by missing data. For example, in one site, missing data for 1 week meant that it was not possible to complete SPC analysis of one of their key measures. This site's measurement planning did not include any strategies for minimising or mitigating missing data, a common theme across the sites. In another site, data collection was frustrated by the small number of patients meeting the eligibility criteria, complicating any attempts to make valid inferences or draw conclusions about the impact of the intervention. Since very few measurement plans included an advance plan for the type of analysis, many sites failed to exploit some available support tools that would have proved highly beneficial. For example, when using a p-chart, tables could be used to identify an appropriate frequency of data collection and a subgrouping strategy (ie, weekly percentages vs monthly or other period) to make sure that the chart is sensitive enough to be useful.

Analysis and interpretation were sometimes flawed: we saw evidence of sites assuming that their data provided evidence of improvement, but such interpretations were not always backed up by sound statistical analysis. One site reported improvement on a measure from around 75% to just under 90%, but no statistical analysis was presented to back up this claim. Visual inspection of a time series chart seemed to show a potentially unstable process; it was therefore impossible to draw accurate conclusions from such statements. Another site presented data for two measures that showed possible evidence of improvement, but without SPC analysis, it was not possible to conclude whether this was true improvement in the process.

### Practice quality improvement during residency: where do we stand and where can we improve? [^116FqVp2]. Academic Radiology (2014). Low credibility.

Rationale and Objectives

Completing a systems-based practice project, equivalent to a practice quality improvement project (PQI), is a residency requirement by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education and an American Board of Radiology milestone. The aim of this study was to assess the residents' perspectives on quality improvement projects in radiology.

Materials and Methods

Survey data were collected from 154 trainee members of the Association of University Radiologists to evaluate the residents' views on PQI.

Results

Most residents were aware of the requirement of completing a PQI project and had faculty mentors for their projects. Residents who thought it was difficult to find a mentor were more likely to start their project later in residency (P < .0001). Publication rates were low overall, and lack of time was considered the greatest obstacle. Having dedicated time for a PQI project was associated with increased likelihood of publishing or presenting the data (P = 0.0091). Residents who rated the five surveyed PQI steps (coming up with an idea, finding a mentor, designing a project, finding resources, and finding time) as difficult steps were more likely to not have initiated a PQI project (P < .0001 for the first four and P = 0.0046 for time).

Conclusion

We present five practical areas of improvement to make PQI a valuable learning experience: 1) Increasing awareness of PQI and providing ideas for projects, 2) encouraging faculty mentorship and publication, 3) educating residents about project design and implementation, 4) providing resources such as books and funds, and 5) allowing dedicated time.

### Midodrine hydrochloride (proAmatine) [^114C2VZJ]. FDA (2010). Low credibility.

In a 2-day study, after open-label midodrine, known midodrine responders
received midodrine 10 mg or placebo at 0, 3, and 6 hours. One-minute standing
systolic blood pressures were increased 1 hour after each dose by about 15 mmHg
and 3 hours after each dose by about 12mmHg; 3-minute standing pressures were
increased also at 1, but not 3, hours after dosing. There were increases in
standing time seen intermittently 1 hour after dosing, but not at 3 hours.

In a 1-day, dose-response trial, single doses of 0, 2.5, 10, and 20 mg of
midodrine were given to 25 patients. The 10- and 20-mg doses produced increases
in standing 1- minute systolic pressure of about 30 mmHg at 1 hour; the increase
was sustained in part for 2 hours after 10 mg and 4 hours after 20 mg. Supine
systolic pressure was = 200 mmHg in 22% of patients on 10mg and 45% of patients
on 20 mg; elevated pressures often lasted 6 hours or more.

Special Populations

A study with 16 patients undergoing hemodialysis demonstrated that ProAmatine ®is removed by dialysis.

### Total workload and recovery in relation to worktime reduction: a randomised controlled intervention study with time-use data [^115WakMt]. Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Exploring the importance of gender, children and job nature

The time-use patterns in relation to the intervention were similar for men and women as well as for those having children living at home and those who did not. Living with a partner and living alone with children did not influence time-use patterns in relation to the intervention.

Despite the fact that there were no differences between subgroups related to the intervention, it has previously been shown that reduced worktime is associated with less conflict between work and family life, and that the effects of a shorter workday on work family conflict were more appreciated by employees with children as compared with those without children. In Anttila et al's study, there were only women participating, ruling out the possibility to investigate gender differences. In the study by Åkerstedt et al on worktime reduction, the strongest effect of the intervention was the increasing time spent with family and friends, which was estimated by the participants to be 'too little' at the start and somewhere between 'almost' and 'completely sufficient' after the introduction of the reduced worktime.

Statistics Sweden showed in their report Women and men in Sweden that both men and women (aged between 20 and 64 years) have an average total workload of about 8 hours per day (workdays and days off included). During workdays women spend about 9 hours and men about 9.5 hours in paid and non-paid work. Importantly, more men than women work full time (55% of all working women and 73% of all working men in Sweden are full-time workers), and even though women spend more time in non-paid work as compared with men these differences have been more equalised during the past years. The amount of time spent on personal needs and in free-time activities over the week is very similar for men and women in this report, although women spend more time during workdays and men more time on weekends in these activities.

### Primary care sports medicine fellowship: AMSSM proposed standards of excellence [^116P4heE]. Clinical Journal of Sport Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Primary care sports medicine fellowship duty hours and call policies — programs should have and discuss a duty-hours policy that addresses the 80-hour work week; a minimum of 1 day free of duty every week (when averaged over 4 weeks); a maximum of 24 hours of continuous duty with no additional clinical responsibilities after 24 hours of continuous in-house duty; effective transitions of care taking no more than an additional 4 hours; 8 hours free of duty between scheduled duty periods; no more than 6 consecutive nights of night float; in-house call no more frequently than every-third-night; and at-home call counting toward the 80-hour maximum weekly hour limit when called into the hospital. Programs must have a moonlighting policy, moonlighting must not interfere with educational goals, and moonlighting time must be counted toward the 80-hour work week limitation. Programs should also define when fellows can break duty hours: in unusual circumstances fellows, on their own initiative, may remain beyond their scheduled period of duty to continue to provide care to a single patient or return to the hospital with less than the expected 8-hours free of duty; justifications for such extensions are limited to reasons of required continuity for a severely ill or unstable patient, academic importance of the events transpiring, or humanistic attention to the needs of a patient or family; these instances must be documented and reviewed with the Program Director after each occurrence.

The purpose of ST tools use was categorized into 3 groups: 1) only education, 2) leisure/ entertainment, and 3) Both of them. Leisure or entertainment was explained to the students as follows: reading or listening for a fun time, talking with friends, and recreational ST (watching TV, video, time spent in front of a computer screen, smartphone, tablet for any reason). SB was calculated by summing up ST and HT per day.

According to the age of the students, the PA questionnaire for the adolescents (PAQ-A) or older children (PAQ-C) was used to assess the general levels of PA for the students. The score ranges for PAQ were from 1–5. The inactive, moderate, and active students scored between 1–1.9, 2–3.9, and 4–5, respectively.

Anthropometric information (weight, height, BMI, and waist circumference (WC)) were measured in the morning before completing the questionnaires and the students were lightly dressed and without shoes. BMI (kg/m²) was calculated by this equation: weight (kg) /height² (m²). BMI z-score was categorized into normal students (BMI between 1SD to -2SD) and overweight or obesity (BMI ≥ 1SD)). Age-and-sex-specific 90 th percentile cut-offs of WC was used to categorize into 2 groups including normal (< 90 th percentile) and central/abdominal obesity (≥ 90 th percentile).

Daily energy intake was assessed by the average of three, 24-h dietary recalls (2 weekdays and 1 weekend) for each student, individually.

### The resident 80-hour work week: how has it affected surgical specialties? [^113HUcF6]. The Laryngoscope (2004). Low credibility.

Objectives

To identify strategies employed by surgical departments to address recently implemented resident duty hour regulations, and to assess resident and faculty acceptance of these changes.

Methods

Attendees to the 2003 Residency Program Coordinator/Administrator Workshop for sub-specialties (Denver, CO) were surveyed.

Results

The study population included 46 respondents spanning 9 surgical sub-specialties. Forty-eight percent of programs instituted at least 1 administrative change specifically to comply with duty hour regulations. The most commonly employed strategies were the hiring of nurse practitioners or physician assistants (30%) and the use of Internet-based software to track resident duty hours (30%). Other changes included giving call responsibilities to residents on research rotations (19%), institution of home-call (13%), and assignment of a night-float resident (11%). Perceptions of program coordinators indicated that junior residents and junior faculty accepted changes better than did senior residents and senior faculty (P = 0.025).

Conclusion

The resident 80-hour work week is a major health care policy change that has required academic sub-specialty departments to make significant alterations in their administrative structure. Further study is necessary to determine how these changes affect both quality of training and patient care in the short and long term.

### The personal physician's role in helping patients with medical conditions stay at work or return to work [^117Jwpv6]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Guidance for physicians — encouraging routine activity, minimizing time off work, and structuring return-to-work plans is specified as follows. Physicians should encourage patients to minimize life disruption due to illness, injury, or other health conditions and to keep as closely as possible to their usual daily routine; for employed patients this includes finding a way to stay at work. If work must be interrupted, the time away from employment should be minimized, and the patient returned to transitional work or full duty as soon as it is medically reasonable and safe. If a patient cannot safely perform the usual job, the physician should encourage some type of productive work activity through temporary restrictions, with exceptions when serious medical or safety hazards would be involved or when existing laws or regulations prohibit specific occupations. Patients whose care includes attention to occupational issues have faster recoveries and a more sustainable return to work, and in the workers' compensation arena there is a time-sensitive window: by the 12th week off work, there is a 50% probability that the individual will still be off at 1 year. Programs to return patients to work should include medical treatment or care plans that consist of current best medical practices that are evidence-based; treatment plans should identify the optimal sequence and timing of interventions, the physician should understand typical durations of treatment and anticipated time off work, and should provide rationale for any delay in return to full or light duty; and prompt addressing of causality.

### No evidence for decision fatigue using large-scale field data from healthcare [^113BkFUJ]. Communications Psychology (2025). Medium credibility.

a) Overlap AM-PM shift. Here we want as much separation as possible in time spent at work (long for the AM shift, short for the PM shift) but also as large a sample as possible. For example, choosing only those nurses who start very early would mean increased separation (longer time until the overlap period) but at the cost of getting a smaller sample, because those who start later but are still in the AM shift would be excluded. We used the following main rules: Consider only decisions taken between 13:00–17:00 on Mon–Fri for workers who either take their first call 6:00–9:00 and their last call after 13:00 (AM worker), or take their first call 13:00–18:00 and their last call after 19:00 (PM worker). Then also exclude workers who take < 12 calls because they are likely working on other tasks (e.g. admin) that we do not have data on. Further, we divide the relevant time window (13:00–17:00) in 30 min time bins (thus eight in total) and keep only those bins with > 100 observations for each category of workers (AM and PM shifts, respectively). Applied to the pilot data these rules resulted in a final sample size of n = 9730 calls to k = 166 nurses; applied to the target data (stage 2), using these rules resulted in a final sample size of n = 9648 calls to k = 143 nurses.

b) Intense call sequences before vs. after breaks. Here we want sufficiently long and intense sequences, meaning many calls with little time in-between for rest, but also as large a sample as possible. We used the following main rules: Consider only sequences where a nurse handled at least five calls before and five calls after a break 8–40 min, and there are at most five min between each call. The exact values used here are arbitrary (unless changed substantially), e.g. using 7 or 9 min instead of 8 min as lower cutoff for a break should not make a difference; the important part for us was to decide on and specify these values exactly and in advance, in order to credibly restrict analytic flexibility later on when analyzing the new data. These rules resulted in a final sample size of n = 5120 calls to k = 116 nurses in the pilot data; and n = 4940 calls to k = 77 nurses in the target (stage 2) data.

Pre- and post- intervention changes

There were no significant changes in device-measured total sedentary time, standing time, average steps, sit to stand transitions, or number of bouts of sitting > 30 min (Table 2). Device-measured movement patterns by weekday and weekend day are shown in Additional file 3, Table S3. At Site A, participants had significantly more sit-to-stand transitions at baseline on weekdays compared to weekends (Weekdays: 51.35 ± 10.76, Weekends: 44.40 ± 10.00, t = 3.38, p = 0.03).

One participant was excluded from analysis of self-reported sedentary time due to invalid data (sum of values exceeded 24 h) leaving n = 9. Across the six domains of napping, seated reading, listening to music, watching TV, seated hobbies, and talking to friends, there was a large but non-significant 142.2 min/day decrease in weekday sedentary time (t = 1.96, p = 0.09, Cohen's d = 0.90) (Table 3). Self-report data from each domain of the LASA questionnaire can be viewed in Additional file 2, Table S2.

### Workers' activity profiles associated with predicted 10-year cardiovascular disease risk [^115tsWys]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Daily Physical Activity

Participants were asked to wear an Actical accelerometer (Philips Respironics, Bend, OR) on their right hip during waking hours for 7 consecutive days starting at a date scheduled soon after completing the survey component of the CHMS. The Actical was previously validated to measure PA in adults. Each device measured time‐stamped acceleration in all directions. For this study, respondents were required to have at least 4 days with ≥ 10 hours of accelerometer wear time. Device‐measured activity counts were summed over 1‐minute intervals. The total activity undertaken was derived by calculating the average counts per minute for 10‐minute periods over the course of a 24‐hour day. Weekday and weekend counts were examined separately. Over 10‐minute periods, low PA was defined as accumulating < 1000 counts, moderate PA defined as 1000 to 2000 counts, and high PA defined as > 2000 counts. Figure 1 outlines the accelerometer data processing steps.

Figure 1
Accelerometer data processing steps.

CHMS indicates Canadian Health Measures Survey.

To supplement the accelerometer‐derived activity profiles, we obtained self‐reported PA from the household questionnaire of CHMS cycles 4 and 5. Respondents were asked to report their weekly time, of at least 10 minutes, in the following activities: "recreational PA", "active transportation", and "other PA" (eg, while working, in or around the home). For each PA question, the proportion of respondents reporting any time in a PA domain, and total time per week in each PA domain were examined.

### To disclose, or not to disclose? Context matters [^116vxrrJ]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2015). Low credibility.

' — In an ideal world, we would probably say, you know, anything that is of high relevance for the patient should be returned, even if it's a certain period of time. But, of course, the longer time goes on in terms of the feasibility of actually doing that, and also knowing the limitations of research studies – as a researcher I know that, as much as we would like to do that, there are certain limitations in terms of resource s that will not really make it possible to return findings to patients after five or. ten years'.
Certainly, resource constraints remain a limiting factor to maintaining ties with participants beyond a study's duration. But whereas resource distribution can have a finite end, the continuation of professional responsibilities to patients may not be so linear. The clinical and analytical validity of a genetic diagnosis is proportional to technological innovation and time. Presumably as genetic technology becomes more ubiquitous in the clinical sphere, the validity of genetic findings discovered in previous years become subject to reevaluation. It is this issue that has at least one researcher worried:

' — So that's the problem [with disclosing incidental findings], or at least one of the problems: For how long? If the results become available ten years later, really, we're opening such a huge box that's potentially without boundaries, and I'm concerned about the responsibility that that might put upon us. '

In contrast, one clinician investigator argued if the participant can be traced and recontacted using stored information, the responsibility to inform extends beyond the duration of the study. Although this responsibility is believed to exist, the respondent identified that fulfilling it occurs in the absence of a framework or guideline:

' — As long as the data has been stored in a way where it's possible to retrieve and identify the person where there is information of concern that relates to them, then I don't think responsibility ends because the study itself was terminated. But it is very unclear and I don't think right now the way research is structured there is a real clear way of designating how you maintain that ongoing responsibility'.

### Preventing needless work disability by helping people stay employed [^1173aXvf]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2006). Medium credibility.

ACOEM guideline — Stay-at-Work/Return-to-Work (SAW/RTW) decision-making data collection contrasts low-cost/simple with high-cost/complex methods across key questions. For defining functional job demands, low-cost approaches ask the worker about usual tasks, whereas high-cost approaches use formal job analyses with multipage functional job descriptions and worksite measurements. For current work capacity and limitations, low-cost methods ask what the worker cannot do, observe behavior in the examination room, and perform a physical examination, while high-cost methods use treadmill testing, functional capacity evaluation, or neuropsychologic testing and reports from special testing facilities. For determining medical reasons to remove from work or avoid exposures, low-cost methods rely on the physician's workplace knowledge to write medical restrictions, and the page notes that, other than disability duration guidelines, no clinical resource systematically reviews occupational implications across conditions. To judge whether a specific job fits the worker's capacity/restrictions, low-cost approaches make an informed guess or match abilities in a physician's note to job demands, whereas high-cost approaches duplicate maximum job demands in a testing facility to identify mismatches. For modifying jobs or making accommodations, low-cost suggestions draw on physician experience or consultation, and high-cost methods rely on vocational counselor reports with detailed recommendations.

### Gamifying accelerometer use increases physical activity levels of sedentary office workers [^115vMzBh]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

The primary findings from this study suggest that the MapTrek game was effective at dramatically increasing daily step counts initially. Immediately after the start of the intervention, MT players took an average of 2183 (95% CI, 992–3344) more steps per day than controls. An increase of 2000 steps per day is clinically meaningful as it has been associated with a 10% relative reduction in long‐term incidence of cardiovascular disease. 35 Further, the MT group was walking an average of 7100 steps per day upon enrollment, which would place them in the "low active" step index before receiving the intervention. 36 An increase of 2000 steps per day would place the majority of participants into the "somewhat active" step index. This is important given that the greatest physical activity–induced health benefits are realized by those who are least active. 37 While this effect does not persist indefinitely, and the MT group appears to have a more rapidly decreasing step count with time, even 9 weeks after the start of the intervention, the average MapTrek player took 900 more steps per day than the average subject randomized to the FB group.

The MT group also significantly increased the number of active minutes, suggesting that MapTrek was effective for both promoting more steps but also more purposeful steps taken at a moderate intensity. 38 According to the model described in Table 3, at the start of the intervention, the FB group had an average of 24.4 active minutes per day. The MT group spent an additional 12.8 (95% CI, 6.3–19.3) minutes per day active or a total of 37.2 minutes according to the model. The additional 12.8 minutes per day adds 89.6 minutes per week to the 170.8 minutes the FB subjects spent active. The MT average of 260.4 active minutes per week is 73% more than the recommended Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans. 2 A 2011 study by Wen and colleagues, 39 which found that achieving 92 minutes per week of moderate‐intensity aerobic activity was associated with a 14% (95% CI, 9%–19%) reduction in all‐cause mortality and an additional 3 years in life expectancy compared to controls who exercised for < 1 hour per week. Additionally, for each additional 15 minutes spent above the 92 minute per week threshold, there was a further 4% (95% CI, 2.5–7.0) reduction in all‐cause mortality. 39

### The pediatric residency training on tobacco project: baseline findings from the resident tobacco survey and observed structured clinical examinations [^1118PdFj]. Preventive Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Residency training is an ideal time to prepare pediatricians to address tobacco, although few programs provide the necessary training. Barriers to training include competing priorities, lack of resources, and unavailability of expertise. Solutions for Smoking, a hybrid CD-ROM and web site training program for pediatric residents, may enable training directors to overcome these barriers and to include training on tobacco in their curriculum. The Pediatric Residency Training on Tobacco Project is a 4-year randomized prospective study that compares the effectiveness of a special training program, with Solutions for Smoking as the main teaching tool, to a standard training program in 15 pediatric residency-training programs.

Methods

Fifteen pediatric residency-training programs were assigned randomly to special and standard training conditions. Evaluation instruments include baseline and follow-up resident tobacco surveys and observed structured clinical examinations (OSCEs), patient tobacco surveys, and parent or guardian tobacco surveys.

Results

The present report describes the Pediatric Residency Training on Tobacco Project, the special and standard training conditions, and Solutions for Smoking, a hybrid CD-ROM and web site training program on tobacco for pediatric residents. Data from the baseline resident tobacco survey and OSCEs also are presented. While residents believed that pediatricians should play a leadership role in tobacco prevention and control, few had formal training in tobacco intervention, most were skeptical about the efficacy of intervention, and they were more likely to ask about tobacco and advise change than to help patients and parents to modify their behavior.

Conclusions

The baseline findings underscore the importance of the proposed research, and the special training program may serve as a useful model for training pediatric residents to address tobacco in the future.

### It's a long shot, but it just might work! perspectives on the future of medicine [^114K6ek4]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

What was the last product you searched for online? Every aspect of the information presented to you, from its position on the screen to whether the text was underlined, was shaped by thousands of online randomized controlled experiments and scads of data being processed in real-time from millions of other customers like you. Contrast this experience with the last time you received a healthcare intervention. If a treatment existed for your problem, then the (very expensive) evidence for it was generated long ago from a tiny and highly unusual group of volunteers who were followed up for a relatively short time period, with all the data gathered by the company with most to gain from a positive result, approved in a binary one-time process, and with a price shrouded in secrecy. Since then, nearly all the outcome data on the success or failure of the treatment for every other person like you was either scrawled on paper in filing cabinets or, most likely, was never written down in the first place. If the outcome data was stored electronically, that was probably only for routine management or reimbursement purposes and extracting meaning from the "data shadow" is challenging. Consequently, neither you nor your doctor know with confidence if the treatment they prescribed is really working for you, the manufacturer does not have much feedback as to what they could do better, and whoever paid for it does not know if they got value for money. This worries me greatly, as it seems like Amazon is leveraging every drop of data on the planet to feed my daughter the best suggestion for which episode of Peppa Pig to watch next, but that the health system has given me a paper booklet on which to record her health data.

### Total workload and recovery in relation to worktime reduction: a randomised controlled intervention study with time-use data [^113tGurz]. Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Methods

Design and procedure

Data were collected within a longitudinal controlled intervention study evaluating a 25% reduction of weekly work hours and its impact on health. Thirty-three workplaces were included and randomised (see Schiller et al for more details). This is thus a cluster-randomised controlled trial. One of the 33 workplaces was not able to recruit new staff and was consequently allocated to the control group, resulting in 17 workplaces in the intervention group and 16 in the control group. Participants in the intervention group preserved their salary, and the workplaces obtained funding for recruiting more staff in order to avoid an increase in workload for the employees. Data were collected at baseline (1–2 months before the intervention; February–May 2005) and approximately 9 months and 18 months after the introduction of reduced work hours (in January/February and October/November 2006). At each data collection participants filled out a questionnaire and completed activity reporting sheets daily during 1 week. Data collections were made at home through the paper-and-pen method.

Study sample

Initially, 33 workplaces (N) with 919 employees (n) within the public sector agreed to participate, of whom 98 employees dropped out after randomisation. The main reasons for this were changed job/workplace (n = 29), parental leave (n = 14) and long-term sickness absence (n = 14). Altogether 636 employees were included in the study, since they met the inclusion criteria of working full time (n = 180 were excluded due to part-time work), having reduced the worktime with 25% according to the employers' time recording data (intervention group) and having participated in the data collection at baseline (see flow chart in online supplementary file). There were 370 individuals in the intervention group and 266 in the control group.

### Lisdexamfetamine dimesylate [^112DM9BG]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Adults: Short-Term Treatment in ADHD

A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study (Study 7) was conducted in adults ages 18 to 55 (N = 420) who met DSM-IV criteria for ADHD. In this study, patients were randomized to receive final doses of 30 mg, 50 mg, or 70 mg of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate or placebo for a total of four weeks of treatment. All patients receiving lisdexamfetamine dimesylate were initiated on 30 mg for the first week of treatment. Patients assigned to the 50 mg and 70 mg dose groups were titrated by 20 mg per week until they achieved their assigned dose. The primary efficacy outcome was change in Total Score from baseline to endpoint in investigator ratings on the ADHD Rating Scale (ADHD-RS). Endpoint was defined as the last post-randomization treatment week (i.e. Weeks 1 through 4) for which a valid score was obtained. All lisdexamfetamine dimesylate dose groups were superior to placebo in the primary efficacy outcome (Study 7 in Table 6).

The second study was a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over, modified analog classroom study (Study 8) of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate to simulate a workplace environment in 142 adults ages 18 to 55 who met DSM-IV-TR criteria for ADHD. There was a 4-week open-label, dose optimization phase with lisdexamfetamine dimesylate (30 mg/day, 50 mg/day, or 70 mg/day in the morning). Patients were then randomized to one of two treatment sequences: 1) lisdexamfetamine dimesylate (optimized dose) followed by placebo, each for one week, or 2) placebo followed by lisdexamfetamine dimesylate, each for one week. Efficacy assessments occurred at the end of each week, using the Permanent Product Measure of Performance (PERMP), a skill-adjusted math test that measures attention in ADHD. PERMP total score results from the sum of the number of math problems attempted plus the number of math problems answered correctly. Lisdexamfetamine dimesylate treatment, compared to placebo, resulted in a statistically significant improvement in attention across all post-dose time points, as measured by average PERMP total scores over the course of one assessment day, as well as at each time point measured. The PERMP assessments were administered at pre-dose (-0.5 hours) and at 2, 4, 8,10,12, and 14 hours post-dose (Study 8 in Table 6, Figure 6).

### Trends in screen time use among children during the COVID-19 pandemic, July 2019 through August 2021 [^113SLvsb]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Measures

Children's screen time measures were collected during the 8-month period before the COVID-19 pandemic (July 1, 2019, to March 1, 2020) as part of the ECHO protocol. Repeated measures of the same behaviors were collected during 2 pandemic periods: December 1, 2020, to April 30, 2021, and May 1 to August 31, 2021, from the same dyads (Figure 2).

Figure 2.
Date of Screen Time Outcome Assessment

Graph shows number of children assessed for screen time each month between July 2019 and August 2021.

Screen time was assessed with the ECHO Child Media Use questionnaire, which was modified from the Common Sense Census. Type and frequency of TV, tablet, computer, and smartphone use was reported separately for weekdays and weekends by the parent or caregiver. We calculated a weighted average of weekday and weekend duration for each screen time activity and created 3 categories of screen time activity: total, educational, and recreational. Total screen time comprised time spent on 10 specific activities: watching TV shows, DVDs, or videos; playing video games; playing games on an education game device; playing computer games; playing games or using apps on a smartphone or tablet; video chatting; doing homework on a computer or tablet; browsing websites; doing anything else on a computer; and doing anything else on a smartphone or tablet. Playing games on an educational game device and doing homework on a computer or tablet were included in educational screen time; however, because this survey was developed before the pandemic, screen time for remote schooling was not included. All other activities were considered recreational screen time. The child's social media access was assessed with the following question answered by the parent or caregiver: "Does the child have one or more of his/her own social media accounts (for example, Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat, Instagram)?" Measures of activities performed together with a caregiver were assessed and dichotomized as some of the time or most of the time and never or hardly ever.

### Practice guideline for the treatment of patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder [^111Nud3M]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2007). Medium credibility.

Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) intensive ERP versus clomipramine, combination, and placebo — A multisite trial in adults without co-occurring depression tested 12 weeks of ERP, clomipramine, their combination, and pill placebo; of 122 entering randomly assigned treatment, 87 (71%) completed the study. ERP was delivered intensively for the first 4 weeks (i.e., five 2-hour sessions per week), followed by 8 weeks of 45-minute maintenance sessions without in-session exposures. Clomipramine was titrated up to 200 mg/day in the first 5 weeks with maintenance to 250 mg/day by week 9; all active treatments were superior to placebo, and ITT and completer response rates (CGI-I:1,2) were, respectively, 62% and 86% for intensive ERP, 42% and 48% for clomipramine, 70% and 79% for combination, and 8% and 10% for placebo. Post hoc analyses showed intensive ERP with or without clomipramine yielded a significantly higher proportion of patients (> 50%) with minimal symptoms (i.e. Y-BOCS ≤ 12) than either placebo (0%) or clomipramine alone (25%), but refusal and dropout were high at 71% of eligible patients refusing, with 18% dropping out at randomization and an additional 23% before completion.

### Pregnant womens' concerns when invited to a randomized trial: a qualitative case control study [^111SnDvT]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2015). Low credibility.

E. Intervention

Participants mentioned the potential therapeutic benefit of the intervention as a reason for participation.

"Well, yes, if they stay inside longer in that case, than that's an advantage for me, too. Actually, that was my only reason for taking part. But I did need to be convinced that there wouldn't be any drawbacks if they didn't stay inside so long because of it". [Participant ProTwin trial]

Other women disliked an interventional ("active") strategy, and rather preferred the natural course, or were more focused on potential (unknown) negative effects. They mentioned that the risk associated with a natural course is one you do not choose for. It is already present, contrary to the risk of an intervention or the risk of trial participation, which result from the women's choice. All non-participants stated that a negative association with the intervention or a negative effect of intervention played a role, as discussed under the main motivations.

"To me it was already pretty clear, actually. Once I was here I thought, like, just let Mother Nature do her work. I'm not going to mess around with with something if nature has decided that's the way it is. I let it be, you know". [Non-participant ProTwin trial]

F. Information and counseling

Women considered the information adequate, but indicated that the counseling was done very hastily. A no rush atmosphere, where counseling was often done by a research nurse or midwife, with sufficient time to discuss questions, was viewed as positive.

"But maybe with hindsight I think it matters a lot: the person who comes to tell you [about the study]. If someone like Ms J [the research midwife] had come to my bed at the beginning and taken her time over it, then maybe I would've thought differently than when you have a doctor perched on the window-sill, only just not looking at her watch, saying I'm just popping in for five minutes and then I'm gone and you have to make a decision. Because you have to join the study at two o'clock this afternoon, otherwise it's too late. Yes, that feels different and the results are different. Perhaps even when it comes to taking part in the research". [Participant Apostel II]

### Daylight saving time: an American Academy of Sleep Medicine position statement [^116qF8Bf]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Position statement: daylight saving time — conclusions state that existing data support the elimination of seasonal time changes in favor of a fixed, year-round time. Daylight saving time (DST) can cause misalignment of the human circadian biological clock and environmental clock, resulting in significant health and public safety-related consequences. A change to permanent standard time is best aligned with human circadian biology and has the potential to produce beneficial effects for public health and safety.
