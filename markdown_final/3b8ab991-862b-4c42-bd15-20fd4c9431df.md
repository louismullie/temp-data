## Question

Blood pressure target in pulmonary embolism

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about blood pressure targets in acute pulmonary embolism and how to interpret and apply them clinically. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how PE risk is stratified by hemodynamics and why that matters. Then, I should verify the specific thresholds that define high-risk PE and trigger reperfusion. Next, I will examine whether there are numeric "targets" for normotensive patients or if the emphasis is on avoiding hypotension. After that, I need to check how blood pressure is used in prognostic tools and what cutoffs predict deterioration. Finally, I will consider special situations like chronic hypertension, peri-intubation care, and long-term follow-up, and then synthesize a practical, reference-aligned approach.

> Let me first confirm the risk framework, because everything hinges on it. In acute PE, patients are stratified by the presence or absence of hemodynamic instability, with high-risk PE defined by shock, sustained hypotension, or the need for vasopressors, whereas intermediate- and low-risk PE are normotensive and distinguished by the presence of right ventricular dysfunction and myocardial injury markers, respectively [^115wxPf2] [^114bmBSd].

> I need to verify the exact hemodynamic thresholds. High-risk PE is consistently defined by systolic blood pressure less than 90 mmHg sustained for at least 15 minutes or a drop in systolic BP of at least 40 mmHg from baseline, or the need for vasopressors to maintain systemic perfusion; this is the canonical trigger for urgent reperfusion strategies in guidelines and contemporary reviews [^1165KSCs] [^113vYhaW] [^113wKh2T].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about "blood pressure targets" in normotensive patients. I should confirm whether any guideline specifies a numeric systolic BP target for stable PE. The ESC and CHEST guidance emphasize maintaining normotension and avoiding hypotension rather than prescribing a numeric target; they direct clinicians to monitor closely for deterioration and escalate if hypotension develops or if there are signs of impending hemodynamic collapse despite anticoagulation, but they do not set a specific systolic BP goal above 90 mmHg for stable patients [^114bmBSd] [^116sqyH3].

> Wait, let me verify prognostic cutoffs that might be confused with "targets". Observational data show that systolic BP of 120 mmHg or less and diastolic BP of 65 mmHg or less at presentation correlate with higher in-hospital mortality and myocardial necrosis, and the simplified PESI flags systolic BP less than 100 mmHg as high risk; these are prognostic markers, not therapeutic targets, and they should prompt closer monitoring and consideration of escalation if the patient deteriorates rather than aggressive BP-lowering therapy [^111q94ra] [^115ygVHU] [^115ErE2p].

> I will now examine how this translates into treatment decisions. For high-risk PE with hypotension, systemic thrombolysis is recommended if bleeding risk is acceptable, with surgical embolectomy or catheter-directed therapy as alternatives when thrombolysis is contraindicated or fails. For intermediate-risk PE, anticoagulation is foundational, with rescue reperfusion considered if hemodynamics worsen, recognizing that routine upfront thrombolysis increases bleeding without clear mortality benefit in this group [^113vYhaW] [^115uSEkd] [^1125PLxj].

> Let me consider special situations. In patients with chronic hypertension who present with PE, I initially thought to apply a stricter outpatient BP target like less than 130/80 mmHg during the acute phase; hmm, wait a minute, that would be a mistake because general hypertension targets are not appropriate in acute RV afterload physiology, and the immediate priority remains preventing hypotension and RV ischemia, with antihypertensives held or carefully titrated only if they compromise perfusion or are otherwise harmful in the acute setting [^111a7vEY].

> Next, I should review peri-intubation and critical care nuances. Positive pressure ventilation can precipitate RV collapse in PE, so intubation should be hemodynamically planned and fluids given cautiously. Norepinephrine is a reasonable first-line vasopressor to support coronary perfusion pressure, and fluids should be restricted unless there is clear hypovolemia without RV dilation, aligning with ICU guidance on RV-sparing resuscitation in PE [^1145AH5H] [^117Kpbs7].

> I need to ensure I address long-term follow-up. After the acute phase, blood pressure should be reassessed and managed per general cardiovascular risk reduction, with attention to modifiable risk factors and anticoagulation safety; ESC follow-up guidance explicitly calls for periodic assessment of blood pressure during long-term anticoagulation, but this pertains to chronic risk modification rather than acute PE hemodynamic targets [^1168LdUY] [^111a7vEY].

> Let me synthesize a practical approach and double-check it aligns with guidelines. In acute PE, the operative "target" is to keep the patient normotensive and to avoid sustained systolic BP less than 90 mmHg; there is no endorsed numeric systolic BP target above 90 mmHg for stable patients, but systolic BP around or below 100–120 mmHg should heighten vigilance for deterioration and may warrant closer monitoring or PERT involvement, with escalation triggered by hypotension or progressive RV failure despite anticoagulation [^113vYhaW] [^113wKh2T] [^111q94ra] [^115ygVHU] [^114BcDd9].

---

In pulmonary embolism, **maintain systolic BP ≥ 90 mmHg** to prevent right ventricular failure and shock [^1165KSCs]. Hypotension (SBP < 90 mmHg) indicates high-risk PE and warrants **urgent reperfusion** with systemic thrombolysis or catheter-directed therapy [^115uSEkd] [^113vYhaW]. For normotensive patients, **avoid aggressive fluid resuscitation**; use vasopressors (norepinephrine first-line) if needed and reserve fluids for clear hypovolemia [^1145AH5H]. There is **no specific upper BP target**; prioritize hemodynamic stability and RV perfusion [^114bmBSd].

---

## Blood pressure thresholds and risk stratification

Blood pressure is a **key parameter** in risk stratifying patients with PE [^111q94ra]. The following thresholds are commonly used:

- **High-risk PE**: Systolic BP < 90 mmHg or a drop in systolic BP ≥ 40 mmHg from baseline lasting > 15 minutes, or the need for vasopressor support [^1165KSCs] [^113wKh2T].
- **Intermediate-risk PE**: Normotensive patients with evidence of right ventricular (RV) dysfunction or myocardial injury (elevated troponin or BNP) [^114zzQed] [^116RuoX3].
- **Low-risk PE**: Normotensive patients without RV dysfunction or myocardial injury [^114zzQed].

These categories **guide management**, with high-risk PE requiring immediate reperfusion therapy [^115uSEkd].

---

## Hemodynamic consequences of hypotension in PE

Hypotension in PE reflects acute RV failure from increased afterload, reduced preload, and impaired coronary perfusion [^1173QTXu]. This can cause a vicious cycle of RV ischemia, dilation, and further hemodynamic compromise, leading to shock and multi-organ failure [^1173QTXu].

---

## Recommended blood pressure targets and management strategies

### High-risk PE (hypotensive patients)

In high-risk PE, **immediate stabilization** and reperfusion are critical:

- **Initial stabilization**: Vasopressor support (norepinephrine preferred) to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) ≥ 65 mmHg and systolic BP ≥ 90 mmHg [^1145AH5H].
- **Reperfusion therapy**: Systemic thrombolysis is the first-line treatment for high-risk PE without contraindications [^115uSEkd].
- **Alternative therapies**: Catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT) or surgical embolectomy if systemic thrombolysis is contraindicated or fails [^111AdDAo] [^1145aMza].

---

### Intermediate-risk PE (normotensive patients with RV dysfunction)

For intermediate-risk PE, **careful monitoring** and **individualized management** are essential:

- **Anticoagulation**: Initiate therapeutic anticoagulation promptly [^112u5zuH].
- **Monitoring**: Close observation for signs of hemodynamic deterioration, including declining BP, tachycardia, or worsening RV dysfunction [^114bmBSd].
- **Rescue thrombolysis**: Consider if the patient deteriorates clinically or develops hypotension despite anticoagulation [^116sqyH3] [^113iAGRs].

---

### Low-risk PE

For low-risk PE, **anticoagulation alone** is sufficient, with no specific BP target beyond maintaining normotension [^1132t65a].

---

## Role of vasopressors and inotropes

Vasopressors and inotropes are essential to maintain **systemic perfusion** and **coronary flow** in PE-related RV failure. Norepinephrine is the **first-line vasopressor** because it maintains systemic vascular resistance and coronary perfusion pressure [^1145AH5H]. Dobutamine or epinephrine may be added if inotropic support is needed, but caution is required to avoid excessive tachycardia and myocardial oxygen consumption.

---

## Fluid management considerations

Fluid administration in PE is controversial. While fluids may improve preload in hypovolemic patients, excessive fluids can worsen RV dilation and interventricular septal shift, reducing left ventricular output [^1145AH5H]. Fluids should be **administered cautiously** and only if there is clear evidence of hypovolemia [^1145AH5H].

---

## Clinical outcomes associated with different blood pressure levels

Lower systolic BP correlates with higher mortality and complications in PE. Systolic BP < 90 mmHg is associated with significantly increased **in-hospital mortality**, while systolic BP ≤ 120 mmHg is also associated with higher in-hospital death and **myocardial necrosis** [^111q94ra]. Maintaining **systolic BP ≥ 90 mmHg** is therefore critical to reduce these risks [^notfound].

---

## Special considerations

- **Chronic hypertension**: Patients with chronic hypertension may require individualized BP targets, balancing the risk of RV failure against the potential benefits of aggressive BP control.
- **Comorbidities**: Coexisting conditions such as heart failure, renal impairment, or chronic lung disease may influence BP management strategies and require careful titration of vasopressors and fluids [^113vcb4g].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Risk category** | **Blood pressure target** | **Management strategy** |
|-|-|-|
| High-risk PE | Systolic BP ≥ 90 mmHg | - Vasopressors <br/> - Systemic thrombolysis <br/> - CDT or surgical embolectomy if indicated [^115uSEkd] [^113vYhaW] |
| Intermediate-risk PE | Maintain normotension | - Anticoagulation <br/> - Close monitoring <br/> - Rescue thrombolysis if deterioration [^114bmBSd] [^116sqyH3] |
| Low-risk PE | Maintain normotension | Anticoagulation alone [^1132t65a] |

---

Maintaining **systolic BP ≥ 90 mmHg** is essential in PE to prevent RV failure and shock. High-risk PE requires immediate reperfusion, while intermediate- and low-risk PE are managed with anticoagulation and close monitoring. Vasopressors and careful fluid management are key to maintaining hemodynamic stability.

Signs and Symptoms of Pulmonary Embolism Patients with a small PE may experience no symptoms. Larger PEs commonly cause shortness of breath and chest pain. Very large PEs can limit the heart's ability to deliver blood to the lung, causing low blood pressure, fainting, or death. Risk Factors for Pulmonary Embolism. Diagnosis of Pulmonary Embolism The first step of diagnosis involves determining the likelihood of PE using a validated scoring system or the clinical opinion of a treating clinician. Patients at low or moderate risk of PE typically undergo blood testing for D-dimer, which is a by-product of blood clotting. If the D-dimer level is low, no further evaluation for PE is needed. An imaging study should be ordered for all patients at high risk of PE and those at low or intermediate risk who have elevated D-dimer. The preferred imaging test is a computed tomography pulmonary angiogram, which uses intravenous contrast to identify blood clots in the pulmonary artery.

The preferred medication for most patients with PE is a direct oral anticoagulant, which includes apixaban, rivaroxaban, edoxaban, and dabigatran. Vitamin K antagonist drugs are recommended for patients with certain conditions associated with increased risk of blood clots. Pregnant patients with PE should be treated with low-molecular-weight heparin because this medication does not cause fetal anomalies. Patients at high risk of death from PE without an increased risk of bleeding should receive a clot-dissolving medication. Other treatment options for high-risk PE may include catheter-based therapy or surgery to remove blood clots from the lung. Potential Consequences of Pulmonary Embolism. Some patients develop post-PE syndrome, which may include shortness of breath and decreased health-related quality of life several months after starting anticoagulation.

Approximately 1% to 4% of patients with an acute PE develop chronically elevated pressure in the pulmonary artery. This condition has a mortality rate of 25% to 30% at 3 years, if untreated, but can be cured or improved with surgery.

### The impact of right ventricular dysfunction on the prognosis and therapy of normotensive patients with pulmonary embolism [^115F6t6i]. Chest (2004). Low credibility.

The prognosis and optimal therapy of patients with pulmonary embolism (PE) are strongly influenced by the presence or absence of associated hemodynamic derangements. Patients with normal systemic arterial pressure have a relatively low risk of recurrent PE and death when treated promptly with therapeutic anticoagulation. Those who present with hypotension, shock, or cardiac arrest, however, have a much higher mortality rate and often receive thrombolytic therapy. Recent evidence indicates that the presence of right ventricular (RV) dysfunction identifies a subgroup of normotensive patients with a much more guarded prognosis who may benefit from more intensive therapy with thrombolytic agents. This article reviews our current understanding of the pathophysiology and diagnosis of RV dysfunction and its impact on the prognosis and therapy of normotensive patients with PE.

Indications and contraindications to invasive haemodynamic monitoring

Current 2021 ESC guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of HF state that the CardioMEMS system may be considered to measure and monitor PAP in symptomatic patients with HF with reduced ejection fraction in order to improve clinical outcomes with a class IIb recommendation and a level of evidence B, as based on only the CHAMPION trial. However, the ESC guidelines were published before the results of GUIDE‐HF became available and, similarly, the 2023 ESC guideline focused update was also finalized before MONITOR‐HF was published.

The CardioMEMS HF system represents a significant advance in HF management, offering a tailored treatment for patients with HF. However, it is crucial to consider both medical indications and contraindications, as well as the patient's overall health profile, compliance with medical care, and the potential benefits of remote monitoring (Table 2). Higher risk groups, such as NYHA class III patients and patients with a recent HF hospitalization, will most likely receive the larger absolute risk reductions. Results demonstrate consistent benefits from PAP‐guided remote patient management across the LVEF spectrum with elevated PAP despite being already on GDMT. Subgroup analyses have demonstrated that the CardioMEMS system has beneficial effects across different subgroups, including patients with left ventricular assist device (LVAD), patients with cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT), and patients with pulmonary hypertension, regardless of the subtype. Both male and female patients experienced similar reductions in HF‐related hospitalizations, which is reassuring given known disparities in HF treatment by sex. The efficacy was also independent of LVEF.

Table 2
Indications and contraindications to invasive haemodynamic monitoring with the CardioMEMS system

Contraindications include patients who cannot take antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy post‐implantation and those with conditions like active infections, history of recurrent pulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis. Additionally, the treatment is not advised for patients with severe kidney dysfunction, congenital heart disease, coagulation disorders, hypersensitivity to certain medications, recent CRT implantation, or those who present certain physical parameters such as a high body mass index and chest circumference.

Based on the available data, the CardioMEMS system is useful for patients with symptomatic HF at moderate to high risk of new worsening HF events as shown by one or more worsening HF events in the previous year (Figure 1). The characteristics of the ideal candidate for remote invasive PAP monitoring are depicted in Figure 2.

### Advanced management of intermediate-and high-risk pulmonary embolism: JACC focus seminar [^113HRHDR]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Intermediate-risk (submassive) pulmonary embolism (PE) describes normotensive patients with evidence of right ventricular compromise, whereas high-risk (massive) PE comprises those who have experienced hemodynamic decompensation with hypotension, cardiogenic shock, or cardiac arrest. Together, these 2 syndromes represent the most clinically challenging manifestations of the PE spectrum. Prompt therapeutic anticoagulation remains the cornerstone of therapy for both intermediate- and high-risk PE. Patients with intermediate-risk PE who subsequently deteriorate despite anticoagulation and those with high-risk PE require additional advanced therapies, typically focused on pulmonary artery reperfusion. Strategies for reperfusion therapy include systemic fibrinolysis, surgical pulmonary embolectomy, and a growing number of options for catheter-based therapy. Multidisciplinary PE response teams can aid in selection of appropriate management strategies, especially where gaps in evidence exist and guideline recommendations are sparse.

### Pulmonary embolism severity assessment and prognostication [^114cZ7XJ]. Thrombosis Research (2018). Low credibility.

For patients who have acute symptomatic pulmonary embolism (PE), risk of short-term death and adverse outcomes should drive the initial treatment decisions. Practice guidelines recommend that patients who have a high-risk of PE-related death and adverse outcomes, determined by the presence of haemodynamic instability (i.e., shock or hypotension), should receive systemically administered thrombolytic therapy. Intermediate-high risk patients might benefit from close observation, and some should undergo escalation of therapy beyond standard anticoagulation, particularly if haemodynamic deterioration occurs. Low-risk for adverse outcomes should lead to early hospital discharge or full treatment at home. Validated prognostic tools (i.e., clinical prognostic scoring systems, imaging studies, and cardiac laboratory biomarkers) assist with risk classification of patients who have acute symptomatic PE.

### The PERT concept: a step-by-step approach to managing pulmonary embolism [^114BcDd9]. Chest (2021). Medium credibility.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a major source of morbidity and mortality. The presentation of acute PE varies, ranging from few or no symptoms to sudden death. Patient outcome depends on how well the right ventricle can sustain the increased afterload caused by the embolic burden. Careful risk stratification is critical, and the PE response team (PERT) concept offers a rapid and multidisciplinary approach. Anticoagulation is essential unless contraindicated; thrombolysis, surgical embolectomy, and catheter-directed approaches are also available. Clinical consensus statements have been published that offer a guide to PE management, but areas remain for which the evidence is inadequate. Although the management of low-risk and high-risk patients is more straightforward, optimal management of intermediate-risk patients remains controversial. In this document, we offer a case-based approach to PE management, beginning with diagnosis and risk stratification, followed by therapeutic alternatives, and finishing with follow-up care.

### Society of Interventional Radiology position statement on catheter-directed therapy for acute pulmonary embolism [^111AdDAo]. Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2018). Medium credibility.

European Society of Cardiology — management of acute pulmonary embolism: In patients with PE presenting with shock or hypotension, intravenous unfractionated heparin should be administered as the preferred mode of initial anticoagulation, and primary reperfusion treatment, particularly systemic thrombolysis, is the treatment of choice for patients with high-risk PE. If thrombolysis is contraindicated or has failed to improve hemodynamic status, surgical embolectomy is recommended if expertise/resources are available, and percutaneous catheter-directed therapy (CDT) should be considered if on-site expertise/resources are available. For PE without shock or hypotension, treatment escalation is recommended for the intermediate (high)-risk category defined by the presence of RV dysfunction and abnormal cardiac enzyme levels, with RV/LV diameter ratio ≥ 0.9 on CT prompting cardiac troponin testing unless primary reperfusion is not an option. Rescue reperfusion with thrombolysis if clinical signs of hemodynamic decompensation appear, surgical pulmonary embolectomy, or percutaneous CDT may be considered as alternative options to systemic thrombolysis, and surgical pulmonary embolectomy or percutaneous CDT may be considered as alternative rescue procedures when decompensation appears imminent and anticipated bleeding risk under systemic thrombolysis is high.

### Pulmonary embolism [^115V5a3a]. Lancet (2004). Excellent credibility.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a common illness that can cause death and disability. It is difficult to detect because patients present with a wide array of symptoms and signs. The clinical setting can raise suspicion, and certain inherited and acquired risk factors predispose susceptible individuals. D-dimer concentration in blood is the best laboratory screening test, and chest CT has become the most widespread imaging test. Treatment requires rapid and accurate risk stratification before haemodynamic decompensation and the development of cardiogenic shock. Anticoagulation is the foundation of therapy. Right-ventricular dysfunction on echocardiography and higher than normal concentrations of troponin identify high-risk patients who might need escalation of therapy with thrombolysis or embolectomy even if the blood pressure is normal on presentation. When patients are admitted to medical wards or when patients undergo surgery, their physicians should prescribe prophylactic measures to prevent PE. After hospital discharge, prophylaxis should continue for about a month for patients at high risk of thromboembolism.

Non-thrombotic PE does not represent a distinct clinical syndrome. It may be due to a variety of embolic materials and result in a wide spectrum of clinical presentations, making the diagnosis difficult. With the exception of severe air and fat embolism, the haemodynamic consequences of non-thrombotic emboli are usually mild. Treatment is mostly supportive but may differ according to the type of embolic material and clinical severity.

### Antithrombotic therapy for VTE disease: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^114bmBSd]. Chest (2016). Medium credibility.

Pulmonary embolism without hypotension — monitoring and triggers for thrombolytic therapy: patients with PE and without hypotension who have severe symptoms or marked cardiopulmonary impairment should be monitored closely for deterioration, and development of hypotension suggests that thrombolytic therapy has become indicated. Deterioration that has not resulted in hypotension may also prompt the use of thrombolytic therapy, with examples including a decrease in systolic BP (which remains > 90 mm Hg), progressive increase in heart rate, increased jugular venous pressure, worsening gas exchange, signs of shock, progressive right heart dysfunction on echocardiography, or an increase in cardiac biomarkers. Echocardiography or cardiac biomarkers are not proposed to be measured routinely in all patients with PE or all with a non–low-risk PESI assessment, but assessment of right ventricular function by echocardiography and/or measurement of cardiac biomarkers is encouraged if, following clinical assessment, there is uncertainty about whether patients require more intensive monitoring or should receive thrombolytic therapy.

### Blood pressure for outcome prediction and risk stratification in acute pulmonary embolism [^111q94ra]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Risk stratification of patients with acute pulmonary embolism (PE) is crucial in deciding appropriate therapy management. Blood pressure (BP) is rapidly available and a reliable parameter. We aimed to investigate BP for short-term outcome in acute PE.

Materials and Methods

Data of 182 patients with acute PE were analyzed retrospectively. Logistic regression models were calculated to investigate associations between BP and in-hospital-death as well as myocardial necrosis. Moreover, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and cutoff values for systolic and diastolic BPs predicting in-hospital death and myocardial necrosis were computed.

Results

A total of 182 patients (61.5% female; mean age, 68.5 ± 15.3 years) with acute PE event were included in the study. Five patients (2.7%) died in the hospital. Logistic regression models showed a significant association between in-hospital death and systolic BP ≤ 120 mm Hg (odds ratio [OR], 22.222; 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.370–200.00; p = 0.00660), systolic BP ≤ 110 mm Hg (OR, 22.727; 95% CI, 3.378–142.857; p = 0.00130), systolic BP ≤ 100 mm Hg (OR, 16.129; 95% CI, 2.304–111.111; p = 0.00513), systolic BP ≤ 90 mm Hg (OR, 22.727; 95% CI, 3.086–166.667'; p = 0.00220), and diastolic BP ≤ 65 mm Hg (OR, 14.706; 95% CI, 1.572–142.857; p = 0.0184), respectively. Association between myocardial necrosis and systolic BP0 > 100 mm Hg (OR, 5.444; 95% CI, 1.052–28.173; p = 0.0433) was also significant. Receiver operating characteristic analysis for systolic BP predicting in-hospital death revealed an area under the curve of 0.831 with a cutoff value of 119.5 mm Hg. Receiver operating characteristic analysis for diastolic BP predicting in-hospital death showed an area under the curve of 0.903 with a cutoff value of 66.5 mm Hg.

Conclusions

Systolic and diastolic BPs are excellent prognosis predictors of patients with acute PE. Systolic BP of 120 mm Hg or less and diastolic BP of 65 mm Hg or less at admission are connected with elevated risk of in-hospital death.

### Hemodynamic compromise in pulmonary embolism: "A tale of two ventricles" [^115gSgxK]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2021). Medium credibility.

In acute pulmonary embolism (PE), low cardiac output (CO)-hypotension results from disparate ventricular conditions: The left ventricle (LV) is under-filled and contracting vigorously, whereas the right ventricle (RV) is failing and dilated. The proximate cause of LV preload deprivation is thrombus-induced pulmonary vascular obstruction; abruptly increased pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) induces acute RV systolic dysfunction which further compromises trans-pulmonary flow. "Escalation of Care" interventions (thrombolytics and aspiration thrombectomy) improve systemic hemodynamics by increasing LV preload delivery directly by reducing PVR and indirectly by relief of the strained failing RV.

### Advanced cardiopulmonary support for pulmonary embolism [^113vcb4g]. Techniques in Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

Management of high-risk pulmonary embolism (PE) requires an understanding of the pathophysiology of PE, options for rapid clot reduction, critical care interventions, and advanced cardiopulmonary support. PE can lead to rapid respiratory and hemodynamic collapse via a complex sequence of events leading to acute right ventricular failure. Importantly, reduction in pulmonary vascular resistance must be accomplished either by systemic thrombolytics, catheter directed thrombolytics, endovascular clot extraction, or surgical embolectomy. There are important advances in these techniques all of which have a niche role in the cardiopulmonary stabilization of critically ill patient with PE. Critical care support surrounding the above interventions is necessary. Maintenance of systemic perfusion and cardiac output may require careful titration of vasopressors, inotropes, and preload. Extreme caution should be taken with approach to intubation and positive pressure ventilation. A hemodynamically neutral induction with preparations for circulatory collapse should be the goal. Once intubated, the effect of positive pressure on pulmonary vascular resistance and right ventricular hemodynamics is necessary. Veno-arterial extra corporeal membrane oxygenation plays an increasingly important role in the stabilization of the hemodynamically collapsed patient who either has a contraindication to systemic lytics, failed systemic lytics, or requires a bridge to surgical or catheter embolectomy. Veno-arterial extra corporeal membrane oxygenation has also been used alone to stabilize the circulation until hemodynamics normalize on anticoagulation and has also been used in tenuous patient as a safety net for endovascular procedures.

### Acute RV failure management in pulmonary embolism [^116BugpH]. Techniques in Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Acute right ventricular (RV) failure significantly influences mortality rates in patients experiencing pulmonary embolism (PE). This condition arises from an abrupt increase in RV afterload triggered by clot burden, neurohormonal activation, and hypoxia-mediated feedback mechanisms. The ensuing pathological cascade results in RV dilation, decreased stroke volume, and compromised left ventricular (LV) filling due to interventricular dependence, which can lead to hemodynamic collapse. This paper elucidates management strategies focusing on preload optimization, early clot removal through thrombolytic therapy or thrombectomy, and the judicious use of vasopressors and inotropes to sustain systemic blood pressure, enhance coronary perfusion, and maintain RV-LV coupling. In cases of respiratory failure, mechanical ventilation must be utilized with caution. At the same time, advanced interventions such as extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) or RV assist devices are reserved for more severe scenarios. A comprehensive understanding of RV physiology and the pathophysiology of PE is essential for devising early interventions aimed at averting the "RV death spiral" and enhancing patient outcomes. Timely recognition and aggressive management are foundational to treating acute RV failure in PE effectively. Acute right ventricular failure is a critical pathology observed in patients suffering from pulmonary embolism. The significance of understanding the underlying mechanisms of RV failure, particularly concerning PE, cannot be overstated, as it is a crucial determinant of morbidity and mortality. The development of acute RV failure is primarily precipitated by a sudden escalation in RV afterload, a consequence of the obstruction of pulmonary arteries by embolic material. This obstruction induces neurohormonal activation and triggers feedback mechanisms associated with hypoxia, leading to the aforementioned detrimental cascade. The resultant RV dilation and diminished stroke volume adversely affect LV filling due to the phenomenon of interventricular dependence, ultimately paving the way for hemodynamic instability. A nuanced understanding of RV physiology alongside the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying pulmonary embolism is imperative for developing and implementing timely interventions. Early recognition and an aggressive management approach are vital to prevent the "RV death spiral" and improve clinical outcomes for patients confronting acute RV failure in the context of pulmonary embolism.

### Novel management strategy for patients with suspected pulmonary embolism [^117UkSnR]. European Heart Journal (2003). Low credibility.

Aims

A simple management strategy is required for patients with acute pulmonary embolism which allows a rapid and reliable diagnosis in order to start timely and appropriate treatment.

Methods and Results

Two hundred and four consecutive patients with suspected pulmonary embolism were managed according to a standardized protocol based on the clinical pretest probability and the initial haemodynamic presentation (shock index = heart rate divided by systolic blood pressure). Patients with a high pretest probability and a positive shock index (≥ 1) (n = 21) underwent urgent transthoracic echocardiography. Based on the presence or absence of right ventricular dysfunction, reperfusion treatment was initiated immediately. Patients with a negative shock index (< 1) (n = 183) underwent diagnostic evaluation including pretest probability, D-dimer, and spiral computed tomography (CT) as first-line tests. Echocardiography was performed only when a central pulmonary embolism was found in the spiral CT(n = 33). According to our strategy, 98 patients met the diagnostic criteria of pulmonary embolism: 75 patients (all shock index < 1) were treated with heparin alone, 16 (seven had a shock index ≥ 1) with thrombolysis, four (all shock index ≥ 1) with catheter fragmentation, and three (all shock index ≥ 1) with surgical embolectomy. The all-cause mortality rate at 30 days was 5%, and at 6 months 11%. Right ventricular dysfunction on baseline echocardiography was not associated with a higher mortality rate at 6 months (logrank 2.4, P = 0.12).

Conclusions

The novel management strategy for patients with suspected pulmonary embolism resulted in a rapid diagnosis and treatment with a low 30-day mortality. In patients with pulmonary embolism and a positive shock index, time-consuming imaging tests can be avoided to reduce the risk of sudden death and not to delay reperfusion therapy.

### Surgical management and mechanical circulatory support in high-risk pulmonary embolisms: historical context, current status, and future directions: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^112LmYVw]. Circulation (2023). Medium credibility.

Acute pulmonary embolism is the third leading cause of cardiovascular death, with most pulmonary embolism-related mortality associated with acute right ventricular failure. Although there has recently been increased clinical attention to acute pulmonary embolism with the adoption of multidisciplinary pulmonary embolism response teams, mortality of patients with pulmonary embolism who present with hemodynamic compromise remains high when current guideline-directed therapy is followed. Because historical data and practice patterns affect current consensus treatment recommendations, surgical embolectomy has largely been relegated to patients who have contraindications to other treatments or when other treatment modalities fail. Despite a selection bias toward patients with greater illness, a growing body of literature describes the safety and efficacy of the surgical management of acute pulmonary embolism, especially in the hemodynamically compromised population. The purpose of this document is to describe modern techniques, strategies, and outcomes of surgical embolectomy and venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and to suggest strategies to better understand the role of surgery in the management of pulmonary embolisms.

Results

Study population

Between January 2012 and August 2022, 1060 patients were treated for high-risk acute PE at 34 participating study centers, of whom 188 patients received circulatory support with VA-ECMO as a primary treatment approach, and a total of 803 patients initially underwent advanced recanalization by means of intrahospital SYS (n = 619), ST (n = 36), or PCDT (n = 148). The remaining 69 patients received prehospital SYS and were excluded from the analysis. Further information regarding subsequent second- and third-line treatment strategies are presented in Fig. 1.

Baseline characteristics

Table 1 and Table S1 contain baseline characteristics of patients who received VA-ECMO alone (group I, n = 126), and patients who underwent at least one advanced in-hospital recanalization approach, regardless of whether or not VA-ECMO was used for initial hemodynamic stabilization (intrahospital SYS [group II, n = 643], ST [group III, n = 49], and PCDT [group IV, n = 173]). In the overall population, the median age was 62.0 years, and 53.3% of patients were male. Several baseline variables appeared to differ between groups I to IV, including median age, pH at admission, the number of patients experiencing cardiac arrest or presenting with cardiogenic shock, and the Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS) II at admission.

### Advanced management of intermediate-high risk pulmonary embolism [^1159GsGg]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Pulmonary embolism is extremely common both in the general public and in hospitalized patients, but patients who have intermediate-high risk pulmonary embolism continue to pose significant treatment dilemmas. This is because the short-term mortality of a pulmonary embolus ranges from 2% in normotensive patients, 30% in patients with right ventricular (RV) dysfunction, and up to 65% in patients with cardiac arrest on presentation.

Understanding why a pulmonary embolism can pose such danger is anchored in the delicate balance that exists between the thrombus and obstructive shock. Once thrombus has formed in or embolized to the pulmonary artery, it acutely generates increases in pulmonary hypertension inducing right-sided heart failure. This is the primary driver of mortality in patients presenting with acute pulmonary embolism.

The increase in RV afterload is not simply from the physical obstruction of the pulmonary vascular bed but also the result of vasoconstrictive effects of thrombus-derived mediators such as thromboxane-A2 and serotonin. Although the right ventricle dilates to overcome the rise in pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR), eventually the dilation increases to the point of myocyte dysfunction and decreased strength of RV contraction. Additionally, the pressure overload in the right ventricle results in bowing of the intraventricular septum, decreasing left ventricular (LV) preload and negatively impacting cardiac output.

Treatment should be modified based on disease severity, but at present no perfect predictors exist to determine which patients will decompensate. Clinical decision must be made by integrating clinical evaluation, often employing a pulmonary embolism score, in conjunction with imaging and laboratory markers that note RV dysfunction and injury. This method seems to correlate best with risk of decompensation.

The Bova score was developed to determine which hemodynamically stable patients with pulmonary embolism had worse outcomes. Patients with a heart rate ≥ 110 beats/min, systolic BP 90–100 mmHg for at least 15 min, RV dysfunction, and elevated cardiac troponin had an increased risk of decompensation. Other scores, such as the Pulmonary Embolism Severity Index (PESI) or simplified PESI (sPESI), combined with an assessment of RV function have been used to divide patients into intermediate-low risk and intermediate-high risk and help make treatment decisions. In this chapter, we will review the evidence for various treatment modalities in patients with intermediate-high risk pulmonary embolism. Intermediate-high risk pulmonary embolism is best defined as a patient who has a pulmonary embolism, is hemodynamically stable, but has an elevated pulmonary embolism score and both radiographic and laboratory signs of right heart strain (Fig. 1).

Conclusion

While the optimal management of patients in the intermediate-high risk pulmonary embolism group remains to be defined, a combination of clinical variables, biomarkers and imaging studies may assist in identifying those patients that are most likely to benefit from a closely monitored setting. At present there are a large number of treatment options ranging from various thrombolysis dosages, catheter-directed therapies, surgical therapies, and peripherally inserted devices that can aid in augmenting cardiac output. Developing a superior method to determine who in the intermediate risk group would benefit remains paramount to investigating and further defining treatment for this group. While it is clear that there is benefit in aggressive treatment in the patient who needs it, if patients are not at true risk for decompensation then aggressive treatment only comes with more risk. It is perhaps not the treatment of pulmonary embolism that needs defining but rather better individualized hemodynamic monitoring and prediction of decompensation that hold the key. Until a better characterization of this population can be made we assert that the best treatment intervention may be the implementation of PERTs so that an educated discourse can be made on a case by case basis.

### Time in target range for systolic blood pressure and cardiovascular outcomes in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction [^116WRzKa]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Blood Pressure Measurements and Definition of Time in Target Range

Participants recruited in the TOPCAT study underwent detailed evaluation at baseline. Blood pressure was measured by trained physicians or nurses in the seated posture at least 3 times after 5‐minutes rest, and the average of 3 blood pressure measurements was calculated as the blood pressure for that particular visit. Blood pressure was measured at baseline, 4 weeks, 8 weeks, 4 months, and every 4 months during the rest of the first year and every 6 months thereafter for up to 6 years. We extracted data from the first 4 months and excluded participants with < 3 available blood pressure measurements. Since the therapeutic target range for blood pressure is varied across different population, a specific time in target range should be calculated based on the recommended blood pressure target among different population group. In our analysis, the target range for SBP was defined as 110 to 130 mm Hg, because a target of SBP < 130 mm Hg has been recommended for patients with HFpEF by professional society guidelinesand the same SBP target range has been used in previous study. Time in target range was estimated using linear interpolation, which assumed a linear relationship existed between 2 consecutive blood pressure values and determined the proportion of time for which the blood pressure was within the target range (Figure 1A).

Figure 1
Diagram of time in systolic blood pressure (SBP) target range and stacked bar graphs of mean SBP by time in target range groups.

This figure depicts example of low to high time in SBP target range (A). Participants with higher time in SBP target range tend to have a greater proportion for which the mean SBP was within the target range (B). SBP indicates systolic blood pressure; and TTR, time in target range.

Clinical Outcomes

The primary outcome for this analysis was consistent with the primary end point of the TOPCAT trial, as a composite of cardiovascular death, aborted cardiac arrest, or hospitalization for HF. The secondary outcomes of interest included all‐cause mortality, cardiovascular death, and hospitalization for HF. Cardiovascular death included mortality from sudden death, pump failure, myocardial infarction, stroke, pulmonary embolism, and cardiovascular procedure‐related events. All outcome events were adjudicated by a clinical end point committee at Brigham and Women's Hospital according to pre‐specified criteria as previously described. Time origin (landmark) for follow‐up was defined as 4 months after randomization. Time‐to‐event was measured as the time from 4 months to the date of first event occurrence.

### Optimal blood pressure in patients with atrial fibrillation (from the AFFIRM trial) [^112RgBGc]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

Many medications used to treat atrial fibrillation (AF) also reduce blood pressure (BP). The relation between BP and mortality is unclear in patients with AF. We performed a post hoc analysis of 3,947 participants from the Atrial Fibrillation Follow-Up Investigation of Rhythm Management trial. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) at baseline and follow-up were categorized by 10-mm Hg increments. The end points were all-cause mortality (ACM) and secondary outcome (combination of ACM, ventricular tachycardia and/or fibrillation, pulseless electrical activity, significant bradycardia, stroke, major bleeding, myocardial infarction, and pulmonary embolism). SBP and DBP followed a "U-shaped" curve with respect to primary and secondary outcomes after multivariate analysis. A nonlinear Cox proportional hazards model showed that the incidence of ACM was lowest at 140/78 mm Hg. Subgroup analyses revealed similar U-shaped curves. There was an increased ACM observed with BP < 110/60 mm Hg (hazard ratio 2.4, p < 0.01, respectively, for SBP and DBP). In conclusion, in patients with AF, U-shaped relation existed between BP and ACM. These data suggest that the optimal BP target in patients with AF may be greater than the general population and that pharmacologic therapy to treat AF may be associated with ACM or adverse events if BP is reduced to < 110/60 mm Hg.

European Heart Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Since no biomarkers and surrogate measures to refine cardiovascular risk assessment in patients with PE have been established, we propose to perform systematic cardiovascular risk assessment in all PE patients, using validated scores and risk calculators, and according to current guidelines. Patients with PE and a high cardiovascular risk score, especially in case of unprovoked PE and/or obesity, may require urgent attention to controlling risk factors. We propose that a holistic assessment of risk factors is performed at the routine 3-month follow-up visit, while individual risk factors such as smoking and hypertension should be targeted at the earliest convenience.

In PE patients with established cardiovascular disease, cardiovascular drugs may be discontinued or modified during the acute phase of treatment. This is particularly relevant for beta-blockers and antihypertensive drugs, the administration of which should be carefully re-evaluated in acute PE presenting with hypotension and/or severe RV dysfunction. Careful assessment of the expected benefits vs. risks of such drugs should guide management decisions in the individual patient. Similar anticoagulant strategies based on assessment of the risk of bleeding and ischaemic complications as in patients with atrial fibrillation can be followed. Triple therapy for longer than 1 week should be considered when risk of stent thrombosis outweighs the bleeding risk, with the total duration (< 1 month) decided according to assessment of these risks. Triple therapy may be considered for up to 6 months in selected patients with high ischaemic risk. The treatment plan should be clearly specified at hospital discharge, and this strategy should be re-evaluated at regular intervals during follow-up. i.e. with a short period of overlapping antiplatelet therapy after myocardial infarction or percutaneous coronary intervention with stenting, to mitigate the risk of bleeding. For PE patients with established ischaemic cardiovascular disease, the full dose of anticoagulation should be continued for as long as indicated; a dose reduction in accordance with the label of rivaroxaban and apixaban after a treatment period of 6 months is not applicable in these patients.

Society of Interventional Radiology position on catheter-directed therapy (CDT) for acute pulmonary embolism (PE) states that the Society of Interventional Radiology (SIR) "considers the use of catheter-directed therapy (CDT) or thrombolysis to be an acceptable treatment option for carefully selected patients with massive (ie, high-risk) pulmonary embolism (PE) involving the proximal pulmonary arterial vasculature, in accordance with multidisciplinary guidelines", and "encourages the investigative use of CDT and new endovascular techniques in prospective outcomes studies and clinical trials, with particular attention to patients with acute submassive (ie, intermediate-risk) PE". SIR defines acute proximal PE as "new main or lobar emboli identified on radiographic imaging within 14 days of PE symptoms". Acute PE is "currently classified into three categories: low-risk, submassive (ie, intermediate-risk), and massive (ie, high-risk)". Low-risk PE is "defined by the absence of right heart strain and systemic arterial hypotension", and patients "with low-risk PE (< 1% short-term mortality rate) can be successfully managed with prompt initiation of therapeutic anticoagulation". Submassive or intermediate-risk PE is "the presence of right heart dysfunction in the setting of normal blood pressure", which "represents as many as 25% of all cases of acute PE". In submassive PE, a randomized controlled trial "demonstrated a 5.6% rate of clinical deterioration (ie, death or hemodynamic decompensation) within 7 days and a 30-day mortality rate with anticoagulation alone".

### Submassive pulmonary embolism [^111GHzWy]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) presents a spectrum of hemodynamic consequences, ranging from being asymptomatic to a life-threatening medical emergency. Management of submassive and massive PE often involves clinicians from multiple specialties, which can potentially delay the development of a unified treatment plan. In addition, patients with submassive PE can deteriorate after their presentation and require escalation of care. Underlying comorbidities such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cancer, congestive heart failure, and interstitial lung disease can impact the patient's hemodynamic ability to tolerate submassive PE. In this review, we address the definitions, risk stratification (clinical, laboratory, and imaging), management approaches, and long-term outcomes of submassive PE. We also discuss the role of the PE response team in management of patients with PE.

Although routine RH pressure measurements may help in CDT management and possibly serve as a surrogate outcome measure, more comprehensive pulmonary embolism trials are needed to solidify the role of hemodynamics in this setting.

Diagnosis and management of pulmonary embolism

The diagnosis of PE was established by computed tomography pulmonary angiography in most cases (Table 2). The usage rate of mechanical ventilation, vasoactive/inotropic medication, and renal replacement therapy was lowest in group IV, and highest in groups I and III. The percentage of patients receiving mechanical circulatory support with VA-ECMO before or after intrahospital SYS, ST, or PCDT was 30.2%, 53.1%, and 24.3% in group II, III, and IV, respectively. The least frequently used approach for recanalization was ST (78/991 [7.9%]). By contrast, a total of 235/991 (23.7%) patients underwent PCDT. The most commonly utilized techniques for PCDT, in descending order, were mechanical suction thrombectomy, ultrasound-assisted thrombolysis, and catheter-directed local thrombolysis.

Background

The optimal strategy for blood pressure management after thrombectomy remains unknown. The primary objective of The Early Intensive Blood Pressure Management after Endovascular Thrombectomy (IDENTIFY) study is to explore the efficacy and safety of early intensive blood pressure management strategies after thrombectomy compared with that of standard management.

Methods

The IDENTIFY study is a prospective, randomized, open-label, assessor-blinded multicenter clinical trial. Patients with acute anterior circulation ischaemic stroke who underwent endovascular thrombectomy within 6 h of stroke onset, achieved successful recanalization, and had two consecutive blood pressure readings > 130 mm Hg during the first 6 h after thrombectomy will be enrolled and centrally randomized into intensive or standard management groups in a 1:1 ratio. Continuous blood pressure monitoring will be initiated at the end of thrombectomy, and patients with high blood pressure during the transfer to the wards will also be enrolled. For patients in the intensive management group, the target blood pressure will be < 130 mm Hg, and the use of antihypertensive drugs will be discontinued if systolic blood pressure goes below 110 mm Hg. The target blood pressure for the standard management group will be < 180 mm Hg, and if systolic blood pressure decreases below 140 mm Hg, the use of antihypertensive drugs will be stepwise decreased until the systolic blood pressure reaches 140 mm Hg again or the infusion is discontinued. Patients will have their blood pressure reduced to the target range within 1 h from randomization and maintained until 24 h after thrombectomy with intravenous hypertensive drugs. A sample size of 600 was predicted. The primary outcome will be the rate of dependency (modified Rankin Scale scores 3–6) at 90 days. Secondary outcomes will include intracerebral hemorrhage (either symptomatic or asymptomatic) within 24 h and 7 days, malignant brain oedema, all-cause death, death and severe disability at 90 days, and quality of life at 90 days, which will be measured using the EuroQol-5 Dimensions-5 Level (EQ-5D-5L) and the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36). Safety outcomes will include stroke recurrence within 24 h, early neurological deterioration, hypotension within 24 h, death within 7 days after endovascular thrombectomy, and all-cause acute kidney injury.

### Pulmonary embolism: risk assessment and management [^116FgqiE]. European Heart Journal (2012). Low credibility.

Acute pulmonary embolism (PE) poses a significant burden on health and survival. Its severity ranges from asymptomatic, incidentally discovered subsegmental thrombi to massive, pressor-dependent PE complicated by cardiogenic shock and multisystem organ failure. Rapid and accurate risk stratification is therefore of paramount importance to ensure the highest quality of care. This article critically reviews currently available and emerging tools for risk-stratifying acute PE, and particularly for distinguishing between elevated (intermediate) and low risk among normotensive patients. We focus on the potential value of risk assessment strategies for optimizing severity-adjusted management. Apart from reviewing the current evidence on advanced early therapy of acute PE (thrombolysis, surgery, catheter interventions, vena cava filters), we discuss recent advances in oral anticoagulation with vitamin K antagonists, and with new direct inhibitors of factor Xa and thrombin, which may contribute to profound changes in the treatment and secondary prophylaxis of venous thrombo-embolism in the near future.

### Large-bore mechanical thrombectomy versus catheter-directed thrombolysis in the management of intermediate-risk pulmonary embolism: primary results of the PEERLESS randomized controlled trial [^112ZrKZy]. Circulation (2025). Medium credibility.

The study PEERLESS was published by Wissam A Jaber and colleagues in 2025 in the journal Circulation. This study is related to the following diseases: Pulmonary embolism. In the PEERLESS study, the trial question was: what is the role of large-bone mechanical thrombectomy in patients with intermediate-risk PE? In the PEERLESS study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the PEERLESS study, the population was: 550 patients (259 female, 291 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with intermediate-risk PE with RV dilatation and additional clinical risk factors. The key exclusion criteria were right heart clot-in-transit; life expectancy < 30 days; no receipt of therapeutic anticoagulation; intraprocedural systolic pulmonary artery pressure ≥ 70 mmHg on invasive hemodynamic measurement at the start of the index procedure; chronic PE. In the PEERLESS study, the interventions were: n = 274 large-bore mechanical thrombectomy (aspiration/mechanical thrombectomy by using the FlowTriever® System) n = 276 catheter-directed thrombolysis (thrombolysis treatment per local standard for device selection and thrombolytic dosing). In the PEERLESS study, the primary outcome was: significant increase in hierarchal win ratio of death, ICH, major bleeding, clinical deterioration and/or escalation to bailout, postprocedural ICU admission, and length of stay, assessed at the sooner of hospital discharge or 7 days post-procedure (52693 wins vs. 10509 wins; WR 5.01, 95% CI 3.68 to 6.97). In the PEERLESS study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in hierarchal win ratio of death, ICH, major bleeding, clinical deterioration, and/or escalation to bailout, assessed at the sooner of hospital discharge or 7 days post-procedure (7925 wins vs. 5912 wins; WR 1.34, 95% CI 0.78 to 2.35) No significant difference in major bleeding (6.9% vs. 6.9%; OR 0.99, 99% CI 0.51 to 1.92) Significant decrease in mMRC Dyspnea Score (13.5% vs. 26.4%; RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.81). In the PEERLESS study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in serious adverse events. In the PEERLESS study, the conclusion was: in patients with intermediate-risk PE with RV dilatation and additional clinical risk factors, large-bore mechanical thrombectomy was superior to catheter-directed thrombolysis with respect to hierarchal win ratio of death, ICH, major bleeding, clinical deterioration and/or escalation to bailout, postprocedural ICU admission, and length of stay, assessed at the sooner of hospital discharge or 7 days post-procedure.

### Advanced treatment strategies for acute pulmonary embolism, including thrombolysis and embolectomy [^112xSRis]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2009). Low credibility.

The optimal treatment strategy for acute pulmonary embolism relies upon a multidisciplinary team that rapidly assesses available data, performs additional testing if necessary, weighs treatment options, and recommends an appropriate therapeutic plan to the patient and family. Round-the-clock availability is imperative. Centers that specialize in pulmonary embolism management offer a wide range of therapeutic options. Hospitals with more limited facilities should establish pulmonary embolism patient referral and transfer contingency plans that can be activated at a moment's notice. Management options include anticoagulation alone, thrombolysis plus anticoagulation, insertion of an inferior vena caval filter, catheter embolectomy, or surgical embolectomy. The decision-making process requires accurate risk stratification, which is comprised of several crucial components: clinical evaluation that includes history and physical examination, biomarker measurement especially of troponin, as well as assessment of right ventricular size and function based upon chest CT scanning and echocardiography. The 'old school' approach of declaring a benign prognosis based solely upon the presence of normal systemic arterial pressure can delay advanced therapy until after the onset of irreversible cardiogenic shock. We have now formulated a more contemporary, comprehensive, and multifaceted strategy to prognosticate. Our 'new approach' uses advanced treatment strategies in addition to anticoagulation for those pulmonary embolism patients deemed to be at high risk for a poor outcome.

### Acute pulmonary embolism: a review [^116wmKo1]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Pulmonary embolism (PE) is characterized by occlusion of blood flow in a pulmonary artery, typically due to a thrombus that travels from a vein in a lower limb. The incidence of PE is approximately 60 to 120 per 100 000 people per year. Approximately 60 000 to 100 000 patients die from PE each year in the US.

Observations

PE should be considered in patients presenting with acute chest pain, shortness of breath, or syncope. The diagnosis is determined by chest imaging. In patients with a systolic blood pressure of at least 90 mm Hg, the following 3 steps can be used to evaluate a patient with possible PE: assessment of the clinical probability of PE, D-dimer testing if indicated, and chest imaging if indicated. The clinical probability of PE can be assessed using a structured score or using clinical gestalt. In patients with a probability of PE that is less than 15%, the presence of 8 clinical characteristics (age < 50 years, heart rate < 100/min, an oxygen saturation level of > 94%, no recent surgery or trauma, no prior venous thromboembolism event, no hemoptysis, no unilateral leg swelling, and no estrogen use) identifies patients at very low risk of PE in whom no further testing is needed. In patients with low or intermediate clinical probability, a D-dimer level of less than 500 ng/mL is associated with a posttest probability of PE less than 1.85%. In these patients, PE can be excluded without chest imaging. A further refinement of D-dimer threshold is possible in patients aged 50 years and older, and in patients with a low likelihood of PE. Patients with a high probability of PE (ie, > 40% probability) should undergo chest imaging, and D-dimer testing is not necessary. In patients with PE and a systolic blood pressure of 90 mm Hg or higher, compared with heparin combined with a vitamin K antagonist such as warfarin followed by warfarin alone, direct oral anticoagulants such as apixaban, edoxaban, rivaroxaban, or dabigatran, are noninferior for treating PE and have a 0.6% lower rate of bleeding. In patients with PE and systolic blood pressure lower than 90 mm Hg, systemic thrombolysis is recommended and is associated with an 1.6% absolute reduction of mortality (from 3.9% to 2.3%).

Conclusions and Relevance

In the US, PE affects approximately 370 000 patients per year and may cause approximately 60 000 to 100 000 deaths per year. First-line therapy consists of direct oral anticoagulants such as apixaban, edoxaban, rivaroxaban, or dabigatran, with thrombolysis reserved for patients with systolic blood pressure lower than 90 mm Hg.

### Management of pulmonary embolism: an update [^112aVqbB]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2016). Low credibility.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) remains a major contributor to global disease burden. Risk-adapted treatment and follow-up contributes to a favorable outcome. Age-adjusted cutoff levels increase D-dimer specificity and may decrease overuse of imaging procedures and overdiagnosis of PE. Primary systemic fibrinolysis has an unfavorable risk-benefit ratio in intermediate-risk PE; catheter-directed techniques are an option for patients with hemodynamic decompensation and high bleeding risk. New oral anticoagulant agents are effective and safe alternatives to standard anticoagulation regimens. Recent trial data do not support insertion of cava filters in patients who can receive anticoagulant treatments. Remaining areas of uncertainty include the therapeutic implications of subsegmental PE, the optimal diagnostic approach to the pregnant patient with suspected PE, and the efficacy and safety of new oral anticoagulant agents in patients with cancer. Campaigns to increase awareness combined with strategies to implement guideline recommendations will be crucial steps towards further optimizing management of acute PE.

### Management strategies for acute pulmonary embolism in the ICU [^1145AH5H]. Chest (2024). Medium credibility.

Topic Importance

Acute pulmonary embolism (PE) is a common disease encountered by pulmonologists, cardiologists, and critical care physicians throughout the world. For patients with high-risk acute PE (defined by systemic hypotension) and intermediate high-risk acute PE (defined by the absence of systemic hypotension, but the presence of numerous other concerning clinical and imaging features), intensive care often is necessary. Initial management strategies should focus on optimization of right ventricle (RV) function while decisions about advanced interventions are being considered.

Review Findings

We reviewed the existing literature of various vasoactive agents, IV fluids and diuretics, and pulmonary vasodilators in both animal models and human trials of acute PE. We also reviewed the potential complications of endotracheal intubation and positive pressure ventilation in acute PE. Finally, we reviewed the data of venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation use in acute PE. The above interventions are discussed in the context of the underlying pathophysiologic features of acute RV failure in acute PE with corresponding illustrations.

Summary

Norepinephrine is a reasonable first choice for hemodynamic support with vasopressin as an adjunct. IV loop diuretics may be useful if evidence of RV dysfunction or volume overload is present. Fluids should be given only if concern exists for hypovolemia and absence of RV dilatation. Supplemental oxygen administration should be considered even without hypoxemia. Positive pressure ventilation should be avoided if possible. Venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation cannulation should be implemented early if ongoing deterioration occurs despite these interventions.

ISHLT members have recognized the importance of a consensus statement on the evaluation and management of patients with chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension. The creation of this document required multiple steps, including the engagement of the ISHLT councils, approval by the Standards and Guidelines Committee, identification and selection of experts in the field, and the development of 6 working groups. Each working group provided a separate section based on an extensive literature search. These sections were then coalesced into a single document that was circulated to all members of the working groups. Key points were summarized at the end of each section. Due to the limited number of comparative trials in this field, the document was written as a literature review with expert opinion rather than based on level of evidence.

### European Society of Intensive Care Medicine (ESICM) 2025 clinical practice guideline on fluid therapy in adult critically ill patients: part 2-the volume of resuscitation fluids [^112JaomB]. Intensive Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

This European Society of Intensive Care Medicine (ESICM) guideline provides evidence-based recommendations on the volume of early resuscitation fluid for adult critically ill patients.

Methods

An international panel of experts developed the guideline, focusing on fluid resuscitation volume in adult critically ill patients with circulatory failure. Using the PICO format, questions were formulated, and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach was applied to assess evidence and formulate recommendations.

Results

In adults with sepsis or septic shock, the guideline suggests administering up to 30 ml/kg of intravenous crystalloids in the initial phase, with adjustments based on clinical context and frequent reassessments (very low certainty of evidence). We suggest using an individualized approach in the optimization phase (very low certainty of evidence). No recommendation could be made for or against restrictive or liberal fluid strategies in the optimization phase (moderate certainty of no effect). For hemorrhagic shock, a restrictive fluid strategy is suggested after blunt trauma (moderate certainty) and penetrating trauma (low certainty), with fluid administration for non-traumatic hemorrhagic shock guided by hemodynamic and biochemical parameters (ungraded best practice). For circulatory failure due to left-sided cardiogenic shock, fluid resuscitation as the primary treatment is not recommended. Fluids should be administered cautiously for cardiac tamponade until definitive treatment and guided by surrogate markers of right heart congestion in acute pulmonary embolism (ungraded best practice). No recommendation could be made for circulatory failure associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome.

Conclusions

The panel made four conditional recommendations and four ungraded best practice statements. No recommendations were made for two questions. Knowledge gaps were identified, and suggestions for future research were provided.

Outcomes and definitions

The primary outcome was death from any cause within 30 days after admission for acute PE. The secondary outcome was major bleeding or clinically relevant non-major bleeding defined according to the definition of the International Society of Thrombosis and Haemostasis. All suspected outcome events were classified by a central adjudication committee (GS and FS). Disagreement was resolved by a third author (RC). PE was considered as the cause of death if there was objective documentation or if death could not be attributed to another documented cause and PE could not be ruled out. Hemodynamic instability includes obstructive shock, defined as systolic blood pressure (BP) < 90 mmHg or vasopressors required to achieve a BP ≥ 90 mmHg despite an adequate filling status, in combination with end-organ hypoperfusion; or persistent hypotension, defined as systolic BP < 90 mmHg or a systolic BP drop ≥ 40 mmHg for > 15 min. Positive troponin was defined as a value > 99th percentile of healthy subjects with a coefficient of variation of 10%. RV dysfunction was defined as the presence of at least one of the following on admission echography: peak systolic gradient at the tricuspid valve > 30 mmHg, increased end-diastolic RV/left ventricle diameter ≥ 1.0 in the apical four-chamber view, flattened intraventricular septum, decreased tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion < 16 mm, or right heart thrombus detected in right heart cavities.

Long-term management of mins

Postoperative monitoring and follow-up

Postoperative care aimed at preventing and managing MINS involves a combination of monitoring, medical management, and supportive interventions. For instance, continuous monitoring of vital signs including heart rate, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation can detect signs of cardiac compromise or ischemia in a postoperative setting. ECG monitoring in high-risk patients with preexisting cardiac conditions can also promptly assess for rhythm disturbances or provide evidence for myocardial ischemia. Adequate pain control using multimodal analgesia techniques to minimize sympathetic activation may prove useful in reducing the risk of perioperative myocardial ischemia that leads to MINS. It is also important to avoid opioid overuse, as this can lead to respiratory depression and hemodynamic instability. Postoperative fluid management may help the patient maintain euvolemia and prevent fluid overload or dehydration, which can exacerbate cardiac strain and compromise cardiac perfusion. Another priority includes the administration of antihypertensive medications to meet target blood pressure. Strict blood pressure control postoperatively helps to minimize the cardiac workload as well as reduce the risk of perioperative myocardial ischemia. Lastly, early mobilization and thromboprophylaxis are key components of preventing cardiovascular complications in the postoperative setting. Early ambulation helps to prevent venous stasis, thromboembolic events, and deconditioning which all contribute to cardiovascular complications. Preventing deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism postoperatively is of utmost importance as these pathologies can pose significant cardiovascular threats after surgical intervention.

Pharmacological management for secondary prevention

Post-operative management includes close monitoring for signs of myocardial injury, with a focus on early detection and treatment of complications. This may involve the use of medications to manage symptoms and prevent further cardiac damage, such as aspirin, statins, anticoagulants, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, beta-blockers, and DAPT depending on the patient's specific risk factors and clinical presentation.

The role of aspirin in the prevention and treatment of MINS remains controversial. While aspirin can be given to prevent postoperative thrombosis formation, results from the POISE-2 trial did not support the conclusion that aspirin improves mortality rates associated with MINS within 30 days. However, postoperative aspirin has been found to decrease the risk of major cardiac events and is still regularly given by providers as prophylactic anticoagulation after major surgeries. Overall, aspirin therapy should be carefully considered by physicians and be based on individual patient's risk factors and bleeding risk.

During long-term anticoagulation, drug tolerance, drug-drug interactions, blood pressure, renal function and adherence to treatment need to be assessed on a regular basis (e.g. once a year in patients at low risk, and every 3 or 6 months in patients at high risk for bleeding) to optimize both the efficacy and safety of the treatment. Moreover, emerging modifiable risk factors for bleeding should be reversed and the appropriateness of continued anticoagulation evaluated following expert judgement and considering the patient's preference. A drastic transition between bleeding risk classes may provide justification for (temporarily) discontinuing treatment.

### Management of high-risk pulmonary embolism in the emergency department: a narrative review [^112q7VZp]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

High-risk pulmonary embolism (PE) is a complex, life-threatening condition, and emergency clinicians must be ready to resuscitate and rapidly pursue primary reperfusion therapy. The first-line reperfusion therapy for patients with high-risk PE is systemic thrombolytics (ST). Despite consensus guidelines, only a fraction of eligible patients receive ST for high-risk PE.

Objective

This review provides emergency clinicians with a comprehensive overview of the current evidence regarding the management of high-risk PE with an emphasis on ST and other reperfusion therapies to address the gap between practice and guideline recommendations.

Discussion

High-risk PE is defined as PE that causes hemodynamic instability. The high mortality rate and dynamic pathophysiology of high-risk PE make it challenging to manage. Initial stabilization of the decompensating patient includes vasopressor administration and supplemental oxygen or high-flow nasal cannula. Primary reperfusion therapy should be pursued for those with high-risk PE, and consensus guidelines recommend the use of ST for high-risk PE based on studies demonstrating benefit. Other options for reperfusion include surgical embolectomy and catheter directed interventions.

Conclusions

Emergency clinicians must possess an understanding of high-risk PE including the clinical assessment, pathophysiology, management of hemodynamic instability and respiratory failure, and primary reperfusion therapies.

Chronic thrombo-embolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) after acute pulmonary embolism (PE) — incidence and follow-up: A systematic review and meta-analysis reported "a CTEPH incidence of 0.6% in all patients with acute PE, 3.2% in survivors, and 2.8% in survivors without major comorbidities", while "a CTEPH incidence of 3.1/1000 patient-years and a 2 year cumulative incidence of 0.79% following acute PE" and a prospective study "showed a cumulative 2 year incidence of 2.3% and 16.0% for CTEPH and post-PE impairment, respectively". The guidelines state that "current guidelines do not recommend routine follow-up of patients with PE by imaging methods of the pulmonary vasculature tree, but suggest evaluating the index imaging test used to diagnose acute PE for signs of CTEPH", and "Echocardiography is the preferred first-line diagnostic test in patients with suspected CTEPH". Additionally, "Up to 50% of patients have persistent perfusion defects after an acute PE; however, the clinical relevance is unclear".

Task Force 4: Inpatient management of patients with MCSDs — chronic management after a new neurologic deficit: Close monitoring of anticoagulation in patients with a recent embolic or hemorrhagic stroke is recommended (Class I, Level of Evidence C), long-term control of blood pressure is recommended once patients have recovered from the acute neurologic event (Class I, Level of Evidence B), and resumption of anti-coagulation in patients with hemorrhagic stroke should be done in consultation with a neurologist or neurosurgeon (Class I, Level of Evidence C). To prevent recurrent stroke in DMCS patients, it is reasonable to target a mean arterial pressure 75–90 mmHg, with avoidance of excessive pharmacology hypotension (MAP < 75 mmHg), and collaboration with Neurology consultative services is recommended prior to escalation of antihypertensive therapies (Class IIa, Level of Evidence C). In patients with embolic strokes, data are insufficient to support or refute adjustment in antiplatelet therapy dosing or regimens, and it may be reasonable to consider escalation of antiplatelet therapy in patients who have thrombotic events with documented compliance to warfarin and aspirin therapies (Class IIb, Level of Evidence C).

### Revised paradigm for acute pulmonary embolism prognostication and treatment [^1137gdrS]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

- What is the optimal timing for assessing outcomes after a diagnosis of acute PE?

Early assessment for adverse outcomes might improve decision making regarding outpatient therapy of PE and escalated PE-associated monitoring and therapy.

- What kind of relationship should prognostic outcomes have to the therapeutic and monitoring options?

Prognostication should accurately estimate all-cause mortality in patients undergoing consideration for outpatient therapy. Alternatively, prognostication should accurately estimate PE-related mortality and PE-related decompensation in patients undergoing consideration for disease-specific therapy.

- What is the operational definition of PE-associated deterioration?

PE-associated adverse outcomes include death, recurrent PE, RV dysfunction, end-organ hypoperfusion, respiratory failure, and hypotension (and tachycardia).

- For patients with acute PE, how should clinicians accurately estimate the individual risk of patients for adverse outcomes?

Calculators could provide individual risk estimations that help guide the choice of available therapeutic options. Retrospective analyses of large registries' data could assist with the rapid development of new risk calculators. Prospective studies could assist with the development, validation, and revision of these tools and schemas at a slower pace and at a greater cost.

- What predictor variables should physicians consider and/or which prognostic tools should be included?

New risk calculators should include variables associated with medical history and physical examination, laboratory testing, and tests that assess for the presence and the degree of hypoxemia, RV dysfunction, myocardial injury, clot burden, organ perfusion, and systemic inflammation.

- Which intervention(s) has or have the best risk/benefit ratio for distinct subgroups of patients with acute PE?

Key Points for Practice
- A blood pressure target of less than 140/90 mm Hg is recommended in most patients with CAD and hypertension.
- A target of 130/80 mm Hg is reasonable in selected patients with CAD, including those with previous MI, stroke, or CAD risk equivalents.
- Recommended medications for patients with hypertension and chronic stable angina include beta blockers, ACE inhibitors or ARBs, and thiazide or thiazide-like diuretics. Recommendations BLOOD PRESSURE GOALS In patients with CAD and hypertension, a blood pressure target of less than 140/90 mm Hg is reasonable for the secondary prevention of cardiovascular events. A lower target of 130/80 mm Hg may be acceptable in some of these patients with previous myocardial infarction, stroke, or transient ischemic attack, or CAD risk equivalents.

In patients who have CAD with evidence of myocardial ischemia and elevated diastolic blood pressure, blood pressure should be lowered slowly. Clinicians should be cautious when lowering diastolic blood pressure to less than 60 mm Hg in patients with diabetes mellitus or who are older than 60 years. In older patients with hypertension and wide pulse pressures, lowering systolic blood pressure can lead to very low diastolic blood pressure. If this occurs, the clinician should be prompted to assess for troubling signs or symptoms, especially from myocardial ischemia. If there are no contraindications to beta blockers, the initial therapy for hypertension in patients with ACS should be an oral short-acting beta. Nitrates should be considered to lower blood pressure or relieve ongoing ischemia or pulmonary congestion. Sublingual or intravenous nitroglycerin is preferred for initial therapy, and can be transitioned to a longer-acting preparation if needed.

Nitrates should be avoided in patients with suspected right ventricular infarction or who are hemodynamically unstable. A blood pressure target of 140/90 mm Hg is reasonable in hemodynamically stable patients with ACS, and a target of 130/80 mm Hg is appropriate at the time of hospital discharge. Blood pressure should be lowered slowly and without decreasing the diastolic blood pressure to less than 60 mm Hg.

A New Conceptual Model for Risk Stratification

On the basis of these limitations, clinicians and researchers need a novel approach to more effectively assess prognosis and implement precision treatment, because the risks and benefits of treatment options and patient monitoring will vary on the basis of individual patient characteristics. Development of a future risk classification schema that provides individual patient risk assessment and has a link to available therapeutic options and treatment settings will overcome the aforementioned shortcomings (Figure 1). We define this as therapy-stratified risk classification for guiding acute PE management.

Clinicians will use the proposed new approach to risk classification, in conjunction with patient preferences, to determine the appropriate level of care and to prioritize available treatment options. Safety issues, including the risk of bleeding and other procedure-related complications, are also important determinants of the use and choice of therapies. Although all these factors are crucial in decision making for the use and choice of advanced therapies, we do not directly include them in PE-related risk of adverse events.

Therefore, the proposed new model needs to address the following key issues to improve the approach to caring for patients with acute PE:
- For patients with acute PE, which outcomes should prognostic tools assess?

Prognostic tools should predict short-term all-cause mortality, PE-related mortality, hemodynamic collapse, recurrent PE, and major bleeding.

### Reducing the hospital burden associated with the treatment of pulmonary embolism [^115xebya]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Venous thromboembolism (VTE), comprising deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), is a major health care burden worldwide (estimated annual incidence of 0.75 to 2.69 cases per 1000 population), and is associated with considerable morbidity and health care resource utilization 1. In patients with PE, almost half report reduced aerobic functional capacity 1 year after their PE diagnosis, which negatively impacts on patient quality of life 2, 3.

The hospital burden of PE is particularly high for several reasons. First, approximately two‐thirds of non‐fatal PE and fatal VTE cases are associated with recent (≤ 90 days) hospitalization for surgical procedures associated with a moderate to high risk of VTE or admission to a medical ward after acute medical illness, making them leading preventable causes of hospital‐acquired morbidity and mortality 4, 5, 6. Second, patients diagnosed with PE have traditionally been treated in hospital 7. Last, data from the European PREFER in VTE registry indicated that 10% to 25% of patients with PE were rehospitalized within 1 year of diagnosis, and 20% of these readmissions were due to VTE‐related events 8, 9.

Current guidelines suggest that the approximately 30% to 55% of patients with PE who are at low mortality risk may be suitable for early discharge and outpatient treatment 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16. Nonetheless, clinical trial and real‐world data suggest that 80% to 98% of patients diagnosed with PE are admitted to hospital 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21. The necessity of this strategy is unclear, because some centers have established outpatient treatment pathways that result in ~50% to 70% of patients with PE receiving outpatient therapy 22, 23. As well as clinical indicators of cardiopulmonary stability (e.g. blood pressure and oxygen saturation) and PE risk (e.g. high/intermediate vs. low risk), factors favoring hospitalization over outpatient treatment include first VTE (vs. recurrent VTE), provoked VTE (vs. unprovoked VTE), advancing age, and presence of comorbidities (e.g. renal impairment or cancer) 20, 22, 24, 25, 26. Type of health care system, geographical location, level of medicolegal risk, physician attitudes, and patient preferences also influence the proportion of patients with PE treated in the outpatient setting 22, 27, 28, 29.

### Catheter-directed thrombolysis for pulmonary embolism: the state of practice [^1173QTXu]. Techniques in Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

Acute pulmonary embolism (PE) is a major public health problem. It is the third most common cause of death in hospitalized patients. In the United States, there are up to 600,000 cases diagnosed per year with 100,000–180,000 acute PE-related deaths. Common risk factors include underlying genetic conditions, acquired conditions, and acquired hypercoagulable states. Acute PE increases the pulmonary vascular resistance and the load on the right ventricle (RV). Increased RV loading causes compensatory RV dilation, impaired contractility, tachycardia, and sympathetic activation. RV dilation and increased intramural pressure decrease diastolic coronary blood flow, leading to RV ischemia and myocardial necrosis. Ultimately, insufficient cardiac output from the RV causes left ventricular under-filling which results in systemic hypotension and cardiovascular collapse. Current prognostic stratification strategy separates acute PE into massive, submassive, and low-risk by presence or absence of sustained hypotension, RV dysfunction, and myocardial necrosis. Massive, submassive, and low-risk acute PE have mortality rates of 25%-65%, 3%, and < 1%, respectively. Current PE management includes the use of anticoagulation alone, systemic thrombolysis, catheter-directed thrombolysis, and surgical embolectomy. This article will describe the current state of practice for catheter-directed thrombolysis and its role in the management of acute PE.

### Percutaneous management of high-risk pulmonary embolism [^111Ae2Jj]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Interventions (2023). Medium credibility.

Acute pulmonary embolism (PE) leads to an abrupt increase in pulmonary vascular resistance and right ventricular afterload, and when significant enough, can result in hemodynamic instability. High-risk PE is a dire cardiovascular emergency and portends a poor prognosis. Traditional therapeutic options to rapidly reduce thrombus burden like systemic thrombolysis and surgical pulmonary endarterectomy have limitations, both with regards to appropriate candidates and efficacy, and have limited data demonstrating their benefit in high-risk PE. There are growing percutaneous treatment options for acute PE that include both localized thrombolysis and mechanical embolectomy. Data for such therapies with high-risk PE are currently limited. However, given the limitations, there is an opportunity to improve outcomes, with percutaneous treatments options offering new mechanisms for clot reduction with a possible improved safety profile compared with systemic thrombolysis. Additionally, mechanical circulatory support options allow for complementary treatment for patients with persistent instability, allowing for a bridge to more definitive treatment options. As more data develop, a shift toward a percutaneous approach with mechanical circulatory support may become a preferred option for the management of high-risk PE at tertiary care centers.

### No effect of epoprostenol on right ventricular diameter in patients with acute pulmonary embolism: a randomized controlled trial [^117LD9Mw]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Pulmonary embolism is a frequent and potentially fatal disorder. Despite immediate treatment with anticoagulants, morbidity and mortality are still high when hemodynamically stable patients with pulmonary embolism have echocardiographic signs of acute right ventricular overload.

An acute increase in right ventricular afterload is the hallmark of severe pulmonary embolism, and is responsible for many of its clinical manifestations and complications. The traditional view is that mechanical obstruction by thrombus mass causes pulmonary hypertension. Therefore, treatment focusses on relieving mechanical obstruction, either by anticoagulation if patients are stable, or by thrombolytic therapy in case of hemodynamic instability. The optimal treatment for haemodynamically stable patients with signs of right ventricular overload is unclear. Despite one clinical trial showing some benefit of thrombolysis in normotensive patients with pulmonary embolism and echocardiographic signs of right ventricular dysfunction, thrombolytic therapy continues to be highly controversial in this patient category.

Apart from mechanical obstruction, vasoconstriction of the pulmonary vasculature plays a pivotal role in the acute rise in pulmonary artery pressure in patients with pulmonary embolism. This is supported by the marked discrepancy between hemodynamic manifestations of acute pulmonary embolism and the degree of mechanical obstruction. Furthermore, bringing about a strictly mechanical obstruction in a pulmonary artery causes only a modest rise in pulmonary artery pressure (PAP), rarely resulting in right-sided heart failure, whereas pulmonary embolism with obstruction of only 25% of the pulmonary vascular tree can cause marked acute pulmonary hypertension. Finally, studies in experimental animal models support a crucial role for pulmonary vasoconstriction in acute pulmonary embolism.

Given the role of pulmonary vasoconstriction in the pathogenesis of pulmonary embolism-associated pulmonary hypertension, the potential benefit of pulmonary vasodilators is important. There is experimental evidence suggesting that antagonising pulmonary vasoconstriction by administration of selective vasodilators is beneficial. In animal models of acute pulmonary embolism prostacyclin, a relatively selective pulmonary vasodilator, prevented or partially reversed the rise in pulmonary vascular resistance and pressure. Pretreatment with a prostacyclin analogue protected mice from pulmonary embolism-related death in a dose-dependent manner. In humans, a case report suggested that inhaled prostacyclin may also be beneficial for acute pulmonary hypertension associated with pulmonary embolism. However, the potentially beneficial role of pulmonary vasodilatory therapy in acute pulmonary embolism has never been studied in a systematic way.

In this randomized, controlled trial, we evaluated the effects of epoprostenol, the pharmacological form of prostacyclin, on echocardiographic abnormalities, cardiac biomarkers and on hemodynamic and respiratory symptoms in patients with pulmonary embolism with echocardiographic signs of right ventricular overload.

### Medical management of pulmonary embolism: beyond anticoagulation [^111FbkUo]. Techniques in Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a common medical condition that carries significant morbidity and mortality. Although diagnosis, anticoagulation, and interventional clot-burden reduction strategies represent the focus of clinical research and care in PE, appropriate risk stratification and supportive care are crucial to ensure good outcomes. In this chapter, we will discuss the medical management of PE from the time of presentation to discharge, focusing on the critical care of acute right ventricular failure, anticoagulation of special patient populations, and appropriate follow-up testing after acute PE.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) — systemic thrombolysis recommendations: in patients with acute PE associated with hypotension (eg, systolic BP < 90 mm Hg) and without a high bleeding risk, we suggest systemically administered thrombolytic therapy over no such therapy (Grade 2B). In most patients with acute PE not associated with hypotension, we recommend against systemically administered thrombolytic therapy (Grade 1B). In selected patients with acute PE who deteriorate after starting anticoagulant therapy but have yet to develop hypotension and who have a low bleeding risk, we suggest systemically administered thrombolytic therapy over no such therapy (Grade 2C).

### Risk stratification of normotensive patients with acute symptomatic pulmonary embolism [^116RuoX3]. British Journal of Haematology (2010). Low credibility.

Treatment guidelines recommend strong consideration of thrombolysis in patients with acute symptomatic pulmonary embolism (PE) that present with arterial hypotension or shock because of the high risk of death in this setting. For haemodynamically stable patients with PE, the categorization of risk for subgroups may assist with decision-making regarding PE therapy. Clinical models [e.g. Pulmonary Embolism Severity Index (PESI)] may accurately identify those at low risk of overall death in the first 3 months after the diagnosis of PE, and such patients might benefit from an abbreviated hospital stay or outpatient therapy. Though some evidence suggests that a subset of high-risk normotensive patients with PE may have a reasonable risk to benefit ratio for thrombolytic therapy, single markers of right ventricular dysfunction (e.g. echocardiography, spiral computed tomography, or brain natriuretic peptide testing) and myocardial injury (e.g. cardiac troponin T or I testing) have an insufficient positive predictive value for PE-specific mortality to drive decision-making toward such therapy. Recommendations for outpatient treatment or thrombolytic therapy for patients with PE necessitate further development of prognostic models and conduct of clinical trials that assess various treatment strategies.

### Management of high-risk acute pulmonary embolism: an emulated target trial analysis [^1129iyV2]. Intensive Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Pulmonary embolism (PE) constitutes a major cardiovascular disease entity affecting more than 35 per 100,000 persons annually. Approximately 5% of all PE patients present with persistent hypotension, cardiogenic shock, or cardiac arrest as a result of acute right ventricular (RV) failure. The presence of hemodynamic instability defines high-risk PE which is associated with an exceptionally high mortality rate. In severe cases, progressive RV distension and loss of contractility may lead to obstruction of left ventricular (LV) diastolic filling and systemic hypoperfusion, aggravated by hypoxemia. Thus, the principal objectives of emergency care in patients experiencing high-risk PE are hemodynamic stabilization, restoration of adequate gas exchange, and alleviation of pulmonary vascular obstruction.

In patients with PE and refractory circulatory failure or cardiac arrest, veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO) represents the current first-line mechanical circulatory support device in clinical practice. VA-ECMO is capable of restoring systemic perfusion and oxygenation, but also of decreasing RV preload, thereby reducing wall stress and myocardial oxygen consumption. In conjunction with advanced circulatory support, novel catheter-based systems have diversified the therapeutic armamentarium for pulmonary recanalization, complementing established treatment options, such as systemic thrombolysis (SYS) and surgical thrombectomy (ST). However, evidence regarding the efficacy of VA-ECMO as a bridge to recovery or reperfusion, as well as the optimal selection of an advanced recanalization strategy, is sparse, and data from randomized controlled trials in high-risk populations are not available at present and difficult to obtain.

In order to address the remaining uncertainties regarding emergency management of high-risk acute PE, we emulated a target trial from one of the largest retrospective datasets compiled to date. The purpose of this study was to estimate the treatment effect of VA-ECMO alone, SYS, ST, and percutaneous catheter-directed treatment (PCDT) on in-hospital mortality. Results of the primary target trial analysis along with a series of sensitivity analyses aim to further develop treatment algorithms for this life-threatening condition.

### Thrombolytic therapy for acute pulmonary embolism: a critical appraisal [^112czDLD]. Chest (2009). Low credibility.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a prevalent condition that may account for > 300,000 deaths annually in the United States alone. Although thrombolytics have been studied as a treatment for acute PE since the 1960s, to date there have been only 11 randomized controlled trials comparing thrombolytic therapy to conventional anticoagulation, and the numbers of patients included in these trials has been small. Many studies confirm that thrombolytic therapy leads to rapid improvement in hemodynamic aberrations associated with PE, and this approach to massive PE with cardiogenic shock is a guideline-based practice. It is widely accepted that acute PE without associated right ventricular (RV) dysfunction or hemodynamic instability can be readily managed with standard anticoagulation. The appropriate therapy for submassive PE (PE associated with RV dysfunction but preserved systemic arterial BP) remains an area of contention, and definitive data proving mortality benefit in this setting are lacking. Further efforts at risk stratification may better determine who is in need of aggressive therapy. This article reviews historical aspects of and current evidence for thrombolytic therapy in acute PE with specific attention to bleeding risk, and data regarding hemodynamic parameters and mortality. We also discuss risk stratification techniques and propose a clinical algorithm for the incorporation of thrombolytic therapy.

Outcomes

Our primary outcome of interest was PE severity on presentation classified into (1) high (massive), (2) intermediate (submassive), or (3) low severity using recent guidelines published by the European Society of Cardiology (Table S3). Briefly, high‐severity PE included evidence of hemodynamic instability, defined by vasopressor support or admission hypotension (systolic blood pressure < 90 mm Hg). Intermediate severity PE included patients without hypotension but with abnormal biomarkers and cardiac workup on presentation (including right heart strain, elevated troponin‐I or BNP, vital sign abnormalities, with or without admission to intensive care unit). All others were considered low severity. The accuracy of the EHR PE severity definition was clinically adjudicated via 2 blinded reviewers on a random subset of included hospitalizations in each severity group with 100% agreement (Table S3).

Secondary in‐hospital outcomes included the receipt of PE specific interventions including systemic therapies (ie, systemic thrombolysis administration), targeted therapies (ie, catheter directed therapies or surgical embolectomy), and preventative therapies (ie, inferior vena cava filters), as well as in‐hospital mortality.

### Fibrinolysis for patients with intermediate-risk pulmonary embolism [^1125PLxj]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2014). Excellent credibility.

The study PEITHO was published by Meyer G and colleagues in 2014 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Pulmonary embolism and Deep vein thrombosis. In the PEITHO study, the trial question was: what is the role of tenecteplase in normotensive patients with intermediate-risk PE? In the PEITHO study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the PEITHO study, the population was: 1005 patients (532 female, 473 male). The inclusion criteria were normotensive patients with intermediate-risk PE. The key exclusion criteria were significant bleeding risk, coagulation disorder, administration of thrombolytic agents within the previous 4 days, uncontrolled hypertension, hypersensitivity to tenecteplase, alteplase, UFH, or pregnancy, lactation or parturition within the previous 30 days. In the PEITHO study, the interventions were: n = 506 tenecteplase (fibrinolysis received as a single weight-based intravenous bolus of 30–50 mg tenecteplase given over a period of 5–10 seconds) n = 499 placebo (a single intravenous bolus of the same volume and appearance as the bolus of tenecteplase). In the PEITHO study, the primary outcome was: significant decrease in death or hemodynamic decompensation at 7 days (2.6% vs. 5.6%; OR 0.44, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.87). In the PEITHO study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in death at 7 days (1.2% vs. 1.8%; OR 0.65, 95% CI 0.23 to 1.85) Significant decrease in the rate of hemodynamic compensation within 7 days (1.6% vs. 5%; OR 0.3, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.68) No significant difference in death at 30 days (2.4% vs. 3.2%; OR 0.73, 95% CI 0.34 to 1.57). In the PEITHO study, the safety outcomes were: significant differences in extracranial bleeding (6.3% vs. 1.2%, p < 0.001) and stroke (2.4% vs. 0.2%, p = 0.003). In the PEITHO study, the conclusion was: in normotensive patients with intermediate-risk PE, tenecteplase was superior to placebo with respect to death or hemodynamic decompensation at 7 days.

### Management guidelines from the American Society of Hematology… [^114BZgG8]. AAFP (2021). Medium credibility.

- Aspirin is less effective than anticoagulants at reducing VTE risk but has similar major bleeding risk. From the AFP Editors Every year, up to two in every 1, 000 people in the United States experience venous thromboembolism. The American Society of Hematology has updated recommendations for management of VTE, which includes deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. Systemic, regional, and catheter-directed thrombolysis have similarly elevated bleeding risks. With extensive DVT, the benefits of catheter-directed thrombolysis to prevent PE are uncertain. In patients with PE and hemodynamic compromise demonstrated by systolic blood pressure reduction of at least 40 mm Hg from baseline or systolic blood pressure measurement below 90 mm Hg, the guideline strongly recommends thrombolytic therapy to reduce mortality despite a significant risk of major bleeding that includes intracranial bleeding.

In PE with right ventricular dysfunction but no hemodynamic compromise, also called submassive PE, the decision is complicated by poor evidence quality. After VTE that is unprovoked or provoked by a chronic factor, indefinite anticoagulation should be considered. For unprovoked VTE, indefinite anticoagulation with a DOAC reduces recurrent PE and DVT, although with an increase in major bleeding. For VTE with a chronic provoking factor, benefits are similar for reducing risk of PE and DVT offset by the same slight risk of major bleeding. After VTE associated with a transient provoking factor, indefinite treatment is not recommended. After a second VTE, indefinite anticoagulation reduces future PE and future DVT with the same slight risk of major bleeding.

Evidence is lacking on whether indefinite anticoagulation is beneficial if both VTE events were associated with transient provoking factors.

### Endovascular treatments of acute pulmonary embolism in the post-fibrinolytic era: an up-to-date review [^115ktVcG]. Insights Into Imaging (2024). Medium credibility.

According to the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) 2019 guidelines, in patients with intermediate risk PE, anticoagulation should be initiated whereas systemic thrombolysis and catheter directed therapy (CDT) is reserved for those deteriorating to hemodynamic instability. Under the term catheter directed therapy both catheter directed thrombolysis and catheter directed aspiration thrombectomy are included. Moreover, in patients with high-risk PE, systemic thrombolysis and anticoagulation should be immediately administered. When systemic thrombolysis is contraindicated or has failed, catheter directed treatment may be offered (Table 1).

Table 1
Classification for the management of acute pulmonary embolism according to the 2019 ESC guidelines

The overall catheter directed therapy procedure success rate, defined as obtaining hemodynamic stabilization and overall survival at hospital discharge, ranges at 87% (Tables 2, 3).

Table 2
Summary of the benefits and pitfalls of each mechanical aspiration device

Table 3
Time-line of randomized controlled trials executed for catheter-directed therapies

The objective of the treatment in intermediate risk pulmonary embolism, is to prevent hemodynamic deterioration and instability, expedite the resolution of RV strain and prevent the progression to chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension. We are considering patients that have a lower probability of mortality compared to high-risk patients, therefore the risk of bleeding that is associated with thrombolysis should also be weighed. For intermediate risk PE that is conventionally treated with anticoagulation, but often with poor clinical outcomes, the recruitment of aspirating devices could pave the way for better management of this grey-zone area. For the sake of this review, as in most studies, the efficacy of PE treatment will be evaluated based on clinical parameters, hemodynamics as well as right ventricular/left ventricular (RV/LV) ratio, and mean pulmonary artery systemic pressure (MAP).

Definition of PE severity

In the current paper we have adopted the American Heart Association (AHA) classification. Massive PE is defined as sustained hypotension (systolic blood pressure < 90 mm Hg) for > 15 min secondary to acute PE or a requirement of inotropes or signs of shock. Submassive PE is defined by evidence of right ventricular (RV) dysfunction and/or evidence of myocardial necrosis. Patients with none of these features are defined as low-risk.
