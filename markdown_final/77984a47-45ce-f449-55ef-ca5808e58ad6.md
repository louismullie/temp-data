## Question

Types of stomach ulcers

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the types of stomach ulcers. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about precise definitions and the anatomic locations that qualify as "stomach ulcers". Then, I should verify the major etiologic categories that drive classification. Next, I will examine special morphologic variants and their clinical implications. After that, I need to consider how modern epidemiology and guidelines influence how we categorize ulcers in practice. Finally, I will synthesize a concise, clinically useful taxonomy and double-check that each subtype aligns with the evidence base and current standards of care.

> Let me first confirm the foundational definition so I don't misclassify entities. Peptic ulcer disease is a mucosal break extending beyond the muscularis mucosae in the stomach or proximal duodenum, which distinguishes ulcers from erosions that are more superficial and typically less than 3–5 mm, and this anatomic threshold is the key starting point for any typology of "stomach ulcers" [^748a2eb1] [^afcf66d4] [^43cea925].

> Wait, let me verify the anatomic scope before proceeding. "Stomach ulcers" in common usage refers to gastric ulcers in the stomach proper, but I should not conflate this with duodenal ulcers, which are anatomically distinct and have different risk profiles and management nuances, even though both are part of peptic ulcer disease; I need to keep gastric and duodenal ulcers separate in the taxonomy to avoid confusion in etiology and treatment implications [^748a2eb1] [^e3ca851f].

> I will now examine etiologic classification, because this is the most clinically consequential way to categorize gastric ulcers. The two dominant causes are Helicobacter pylori infection and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use, with H. pylori implicated in roughly 42% and NSAIDs in about 36% of peptic ulcers overall; importantly, these etiologies can coexist, and their relative contributions vary by geography and era, which shapes both prevalence and management strategies [^e3ca851f] [^1fa2fe8f] [^748a2eb1].

> Hold on, I should verify the third category so I don't overgeneralize. A meaningful fraction of ulcers are H. pylori-negative and NSAID-negative, often termed idiopathic ulcers; these require consideration of alternative causes such as gastrinoma, malignancy, Crohn's disease, ischemia, viral infection, or stress-related mucosal injury, and their rising proportion reflects declining H. pylori prevalence and evolving NSAID patterns in many regions [^19992bb4] [^1a02f3de].

> Next, I should review morphologic variants that change management. Giant gastric ulcers, typically defined as greater than 2 cm, heal more slowly and carry a higher risk of complications; they also warrant heightened suspicion for malignancy, prompting biopsy and closer follow-up, whereas smaller, shallow ulcers in low-risk patients may not require routine biopsy if the endoscopic appearance is benign and the clinical context is reassuring [^1fa2fe8f] [^8eaf63ab] [^5755ec27].

> Let me consider acute stress-related ulcers separately, because the pathophysiology and prevention differ. Stress ulcers occur in critically ill patients with risk factors such as coagulopathy, mechanical ventilation, or severe burns; prophylactic acid suppression is indicated in high-risk ICU patients, and this category is distinct from outpatient peptic ulcer disease in both cause and prevention strategies [^748a2eb1] [^1ec746e5].

> I should double-check how modern epidemiology refines the typology in practice. With falling H. pylori prevalence in many countries, NSAID-associated ulcers now account for a larger share of gastric ulcers, particularly in older adults, and this shift influences testing and prophylaxis decisions; conversely, in regions with high H. pylori prevalence, H. pylori–associated ulcers remain predominant, reinforcing the need for eradication therapy when detected [^748a2eb1] [^19992bb4].

> But wait, what if the ulcer is in an excluded stomach after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. Ulceration in the excluded stomach or duodenum is rare but clinically important; access is limited, diagnosis is often delayed, and management may require specialized endoscopic or surgical approaches, so I should flag this as a distinct anatomic-clinical subtype within "stomach ulcers" when the surgical history is present [^1cd1cd50].

> Let me synthesize a concise, clinically oriented taxonomy and ensure it aligns with the evidence. Stomach ulcers, that is, gastric ulcers, can be categorized by etiology as H. pylori–associated, NSAID-associated, or idiopathic; by morphology as simple versus giant; by context as spontaneous versus stress-related in the critically ill; and by special anatomic circumstances such as ulcers in the excluded stomach after bariatric surgery, with the etiologic axis being the primary driver of therapy and the morphologic and contextual axes guiding surveillance and procedural decisions [^748a2eb1] [^1fa2fe8f] [^1cd1cd50].

> I need to ensure the management implications are explicit so the taxonomy is actionable. For H. pylori–associated gastric ulcers, test-and-eradicate strategies reduce recurrence dramatically; for NSAID-associated ulcers, withdrawal or substitution of the NSAID plus PPI therapy is foundational; for giant or atypical ulcers, biopsy to exclude malignancy is essential; and for stress ulcers, prevention with acid suppression in high-risk ICU patients is standard, which ties the categories directly to treatment pathways [^1fa2fe8f] [^1d373b74] [^8eaf63ab] [^1ec746e5].

Stomach ulcers, or gastric ulcers, are classified by **location** (antral, body, fundus, cardia, pyloric channel) [^notfound], **size** (simple vs giant > 2 cm) [^1fa2fe8f], and **etiology** (H. pylori, NSAID, stress, idiopathic) [^748a2eb1]. They are also categorized by **complications** (bleeding, perforation, obstruction) [^8342047a] and by **endoscopic appearance** (active, healing, scarred) [^notfound]. Accurate classification guides management, including acid suppression, H. pylori eradication, NSAID modification, and endoscopic or surgical intervention for complications [^1fa2fe8f] [^8b28a6ae].

---

## Anatomical classification

By **location**, gastric ulcers are categorized as follows:

| **Location** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Antral | Lower stomach; most common site for H. pylori–associated ulcers [^notfound] |
| Body | Mid-stomach; often associated with NSAID use or stress [^notfound] |
| Fundus | Upper stomach; less common, may be stress-related [^notfound] |
| Cardia | Near the gastroesophageal junction; rare, may mimic reflux disease [^notfound] |
| Pyloric channel | Near the pylorus; prone to obstruction due to edema and scarring [^notfound] |

---

## Morphological classification

By **size and depth**, ulcers are classified as:

- **Simple ulcers**: ≤ 2 cm in diameter; typically respond to medical therapy [^1fa2fe8f].
- **Giant ulcers**: > 2 cm; higher risk of complications, slower healing, and may require longer therapy or surgical consideration [^1fa2fe8f] [^6105fce8].

---

## Etiological classification

By **cause**, gastric ulcers are classified as:

- **Helicobacter pylori–associated ulcers**: Most common cause; eradication therapy is essential [^265bda0c] [^5acc2a04].
- **NSAID-associated ulcers**: Common in chronic NSAID users; management includes stopping NSAIDs and acid suppression [^1fa2fe8f].
- **Stress-related ulcers**: Occur in critically ill patients; prophylactic acid suppression is recommended [^1ec746e5].
- **Idiopathic ulcers**: No identifiable cause; managed with acid suppression and follow-up [^19992bb4].

---

## Classification by complications

Ulcers are also classified by **complications**:

- **Bleeding ulcers**: Most common complication; managed endoscopically and with acid suppression [^8b28a6ae].
- **Perforated ulcers**: Life-threatening; require emergent surgical intervention [^9eed04ae].
- **Obstructive ulcers**: Cause gastric outlet obstruction; may need endoscopic dilation or surgery [^aa62705e].

---

## Endoscopic classification

By **endoscopic appearance**, ulcers are categorized as:

- **Active ulcers**: Fresh, with visible exudate or bleeding.
- **Healing ulcers**: Granulation tissue forming, edges flattening.
- **Scarred ulcers**: Fibrotic, often indicating chronicity or recurrence risk [^notfound].

---

## Clinical implications of classification

Classification guides therapy: H. pylori–positive ulcers require **eradication** [^5acc2a04], NSAID ulcers need **NSAID cessation** and acid suppression [^1fa2fe8f], and giant or complicated ulcers may need prolonged therapy or surgery [^6105fce8]. It also informs prognosis, as giant ulcers, NSAID-associated ulcers, and those with complications carry higher risks of recurrence, bleeding, and perforation [^1fa2fe8f] [^9eed04ae].

---

Stomach ulcers are classified by location, size, etiology, complications, and endoscopic appearance; this **classification system** is essential for selecting appropriate medical, endoscopic, or surgical management and for predicting outcomes [^748a2eb1].

Introduction

The principal effect of Helicobacter pylori infection is lifelong chronic gastritis, affecting up to 20% of younger adults but 50% to 80% of adults born in resource-rich countries before 1950.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of H pylori eradication treatment in people with a confirmed duodenal ulcer, a confirmed gastric ulcer, confirmed gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD), confirmed non-ulcer dyspepsia, uninvestigated dyspepsia, localised B cell lymphoma of the stomach, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)-related peptic ulcers? What are the effects of H pylori eradication treatment for preventing NSAID-related peptic ulcers in people with or without previous ulcers or dyspepsia? What are the effects of H pylori eradication treatment on the risk of developing gastric cancer? Do H pylori eradication treatments differ in their effects? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to September 2007 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 58 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: effects of H pylori eradication in different populations; relative effects of triple regimens, quadruple regimens, and sequential regimens.

MEDICATION GUIDE

Medication Guide for Nonsteroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs)

What is the most important information I should know about medicines called Nonsteroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs)? NSAIDs can cause serious side effects, including:

with increasing doses of NSAIDs
with longer use of NSAIDs

Do not take NSAIDs right before or after a heart surgery called a "coronary artery bypass graft (CABG)".

Avoid taking NSAIDs after a recent heart attack, unless your healthcare provider tells you to. You may have an increased risk of another heart attack if you take NSAIDs after a recent heart attack.

anytime during use
without warning symptoms
that may cause death

The risk of getting an ulcer or bleeding increases with:

past history of stomach ulcers, or stomach or intestinal bleeding with use of NSAIDs
taking medicines called "corticosteroids", "anticoagulants", "SSRIs", or "SNRIs"
increasing doses of NSAIDs
longer use of NSAIDs
smoking
drinking alcohol
older age
poor health

### Effects of gastroprotectant drugs for the prevention and treatment of peptic ulcer disease and its complications: a meta-analysis of randomised trials [^9220ba66]. The Lancet: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2018). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Worldwide, peptic ulcer disease is responsible for substantial premature mortality, with much of the burden in low-income and middle-income countries. Peptic ulcer disease comprises both gastric and duodenal ulcers — defects that penetrate, respectively, beyond the muscularis mucosae of the gastric or duodenal mucosa — and its complications can include upper gastrointestinal bleeding, perforation and, rarely, gastric outlet obstruction. Gastroprotectant drugs, defined here as proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs), prostaglandin analogues, and histamine-2 receptor antagonists (H2RAs), have been developed for the protection of the mucosa, healing of mucosal damage, and stabilisation of gastrointestinal bleeding, and are prescribed for the prevention of peptic ulcer disease, to promote healing, and as treatment for bleeding complications.

Research in context

Evidence before the study

We searched MEDLINE and Embase from Jan 1, 1950, to Dec 31, 2015, for randomised controlled trials of gastroprotectant drugs (including proton-pump inhibitors [PPIs], histamine-2 receptor antagonists, and prostaglandin analogues), with no language restrictions. These searches revealed a very large number of studies that have assessed the use of such therapy for the prevention or treatment of peptic ulcer disease. Previous systematic reviews and meta-analyses have reported varying efficacy for specific drugs, or drug classes, on certain peptic ulcer disease outcomes in particular clinical settings, often in patients treated with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). However, a comprehensive summary of the relative and absolute effects of different gastroprotectant drugs on different types of upper gastrointestinal outcomes, with or without NSAID use, and in the context both of prevention and treatment, has not been reported.

### Stomach (gastric) cancer prevention (PDQ ®)-NCI… [^8544e753]. NCI (2025). Medium credibility.

Who Is at Risk. People at elevated risk for gastric cancer include older adults with atrophic gastritis or pernicious anemia; patients with sporadic gastric adenomas, familial adenomatous polyposis, or hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer; and immigrant ethnic populations from countries with high rates of gastric carcinoma. Workers in the rubber and coal industries are also at increased risk. There is consistent evidence that Helicobacter pylori infection, also known as H. pylori infection, of the stomach is strongly associated with both the initiation and promotion of carcinoma of the gastric body and antrum and of gastric lymphoma. The International Agency for Research on Cancer classifies H. pylori infection as a cause of noncardia gastric carcinoma and gastric, low-grade, B-cell mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue or mucosa-associated lymphatic tissue lymphoma. Compared with the general population, people with duodenal ulcer disease may have a lower risk of gastric cancer. Pathogenesis Understanding of the pathogenesis of gastric cancer has advanced over the years. A lengthy precancerous process has been identified in which the gastric mucosa is slowly transformed from normal to chronic gastritis, to multifocal atrophy, to intestinal metaplasia of various degrees, to dysplasia, and then to invasive carcinoma. The process is apparently driven by forces acting on the gastric epithelium for many years, such as excessive dietary salt and, most prominently, infection with Helicobacter pylori. H. Pylori Infection Eradication Helicobacter pylori infection is an accepted cause of gastric adenocarcinoma. Questions remain concerning the natural history of H.

pylori infection, and the mechanism of transmission and the rates of reinfection or recurrence for different populations are unknown. A small randomized trial of antibiotic eradication in 140 H. pylori-infected people suggested the possibility of transmission among close family members. [.

### Management of perforated peptic ulcer: what you need to know [^040550ec]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Despite therapeutic advancements and the significant efficacy of medical management, peptic ulcer disease still affects millions of people. Elective surgical treatment, once a common intervention in General Surgery departments, is now nearly obsolete. Surgical treatment is reserved solely for complications, which occur in approximately 10% to 20% of cases. Perforation is the most common indication for surgery in peptic ulcer disease and accounts for nearly 40% of deaths from the disease. Treatment success depends on various factors, with early diagnosis and immediate surgical intervention being highlighted. Perforation is associated with a high incidence of morbidity and mortality. This article aims to analyze the different aspects related to the treatment of perforated peptic ulcers and define the best therapeutic approaches.

### Helicobacter pylori infection [^6d3d875a]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

Helicobacter pylori infection remains one of the most prevalent infections worldwide, causing significant morbidity and mortality from gastric malignancies and peptic ulcers. This article provides a summary of the microbiology and pathogenesis of this bacterium, emphasizing the complex and protean effects of H pylori on gastric epithelial cells, including stem and progenitor populations, and evasion of host immune defenses. Increasing antibiotic resistance has made management more challenging. This article discusses the appropriate diagnostic modality for different clinical scenarios, and the evolving treatment of H pylori infections, including the use of antibiotic susceptibility testing to aid regimen selection.

### Management of patients with ulcer bleeding [^8b28a6ae]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2012). Medium credibility.

ACG Practice Guidelines — Scope, evidence review, and grading — focus on ulcer-related UGIB and use GRADE for recommendations. Ulcers are the most common cause of hospitalization for UGIB, and this guideline addresses the management of patients with overt UGIB due to gastric or duodenal ulcers, where "overt" indicates hematemesis, melena, and/or hematochezia. The document covers initial assessment and risk stratification, pre-endoscopic use of medications and gastric lavage, timing of endoscopy, endoscopic and medical management, post-endoscopic medical therapy and disposition, and prevention of recurrent bleeding. Evidence review included a MEDLINE search using the MeSH term "gastrointestinal hemorrhage" limited to "all clinical trials" and "meta-analysis" for years 1966–2010 without language restriction. The GRADE system was used; the quality of evidence ranges from "high" to "very low" with stated definitions, and the strength of a recommendation is graded as strong when desirable effects clearly outweigh undesirable effects and conditional when uncertainty exists about the trade-offs; additional factors include variability in patient values and preferences and whether an intervention represents a wise use of resources.

### Management of non-neoplastic gastric lesions [^bf68057d]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Benign gastric lesions represent various pathologic entities and management considerations. Upper endoscopy serves as the primary diagnostic modality for gastric lesions. Persistent or giant gastric ulcers represent unique subtypes of ulcers, requiring investigation of the underlying cause. Medical management remains the mainstay of treatment; however, indications for surgical intervention remain. Gastric polyps also represent diverse etiologies, and accurate diagnosis requires pertinent information and tissue samples. Neoplastic lesions often present as polypoid lesions; a high index of suspicion is required when discovered endoscopically. Malignant transformation potential varies widely between the various lesions; therefore an accurate diagnosis is imperative to determine management.

### Kyoto global consensus report on Helicobacter pylori gastritis [^43cea925]. Gut (2015). Low credibility.

Comment

Gastric erosions are defined as superficial mucosal breaks with a diameter of < 3 mm or < 5 mm. This small size makes it less likely to confound erosions with peptic ulcers which, by definition, penetrate the muscularis mucosae.

Gastric erosions can be detected in the context of H. pylori infection but are more frequently caused by intake of mucosal damaging drugs — in particular, aspirin and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).

Furthermore, several different morphological forms were noted after eradication of H. pylori as (a) flat, (b) raised, (c) haemorrhagic and (d) appearing as bleeding spots with localisation in the antrum in the absence of drugs, possibly owing to hyperacidity after eradication therapy.

From a clinical perspective, the most relevant aspect of erosions is that patients taking NSAIDs and having numerous erosions in the stomach are at increased risk of developing ulcers subsequently.

Few studies on the clinical significance or natural history of gastric or duodenal erosions have been reported. Thus, it is important to conduct a prospective research in which erosions in the stomach and duodenum are separately reported in conjunction with the category of gastritis, which is needed to better understand the natural history of gastric erosions and their potential to progress to ulceration and bleeding. Validated scores for reporting erosions for research purposes should be used.

CQ6. Is H. pylori gastritis an infectious disease irrespective of symptom and complications?

Statement 6

H. pylori gastritis should be defined as an infectious disease, even when patients have no symptoms and irrespective of complications such as peptic ulcers and gastric cancer.

Grade of recommendation: strong

Evidence level: high

Consensus level: 100%

### Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug gastrointestinal toxicity [^66f437ef]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2001). Low credibility.

Toxic effects in the upper gastrointestinal tract, primarily complicated gastric and intestinal ulcers, are the most common undesirable effects of the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. During the last several years, there have been several advances, both in the laboratory and clinically, toward reducing nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs' gastrointestinal toxicity. Some of these important developments are the delineation of mechanisms of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug-induced gastrointestinal toxicity, identification of groups at highest risk for development of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug-induced gastrointestinal complications, recognition of co-therapies that could reduce nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug toxicity, and, most recently, development of classes of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs with improved gastrointestinal safety profiles. Many of these advances have occurred during the last year. This review focuses on several of the important recent observations that have improved understanding and safety of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in the gastrointestinal tract.

### Medical versus surgical treatment for refractory or recurrent peptic ulcer [^08a3bba3]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Refractory peptic ulcers are ulcers in the stomach or duodenum that do not heal after eight to 12 weeks of medical treatment or those that are associated with complications despite medical treatment. Recurrent peptic ulcers are peptic ulcers that recur after healing of the ulcer. Given the number of deaths due to peptic ulcer-related complications and the long-term complications of medical treatment (increased incidence of fracture), it is unclear whether medical or surgical intervention is the better treatment option in people with recurrent or refractory peptic ulcers.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of medical versus surgical treatment for people with recurrent or refractory peptic ulcer.

Search Methods

We searched the specialised register of the Cochrane Upper GI and Pancreatic Diseases group, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Science Citation Index Expanded, and trials registers until September 2015 to identify randomised trials and non-randomised studies, using search strategies. We also searched the references of included studies to identify further studies.

Selection Criteria

We considered randomised controlled trials and non-randomised studies comparing medical treatment with surgical treatment in people with refractory or recurrent peptic ulcer, irrespective of language, blinding, or publication status for inclusion in the review.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently identified trials and extracted data. We planned to calculate the risk ratio, mean difference, standardised mean difference, or hazard ratio with 95% confidence intervals using both fixed-effect and random-effects models with Review Manager 5 based on intention-to-treat analysis.

Main Results

We included only one non-randomised study published 30 years ago in the review. This study included 77 participants who had gastric ulcer and in whom medical therapy (histamine H2 receptor blockers, antacids, and diet) had failed after an average duration of treatment of 29 months. The authors do not state whether these were recurrent or refractory ulcers. It appears that the participants did not have previous complications such as bleeding or perforation. Of the 77 included participants, 37 participants continued to have medical therapy while 40 participants received surgical therapy (antrectomy with or without vagotomy; subtotal gastrectomy with or without vagotomy; vagotomy; pyloroplasty and suture of the ulcer; suture or closure of ulcer without vagotomy or excision of the ulcer; proximal gastric or parietal cell vagotomy alone; suture or closure of the ulcer with proximal gastric or parietal cell vagotomy). Whether to use medical or surgical treatment was determined by participant's or treating physician's preference. The study authors reported that two participants in the medical treatment group (2 out of 37; 5.4%) had gastric cancer, which was identified by repeated biopsy. They did not report the proportion of participants who had gastric cancer in the surgical treatment group. They also did not report the implications of the delayed diagnosis of gastric cancer in the medical treatment group. They did not report any other outcomes of interest for this review (that is health-related quality of life (using any validated scale), adverse events and serious adverse events, peptic ulcer bleeding, peptic ulcer perforation, abdominal pain, and long-term mortality).

Authors' Conclusions

We found no studies that provide the relative benefits and harms of medical versus surgical treatment for recurrent or refractory peptic ulcers. Studies that evaluate the natural history of recurrent and refractory peptic ulcers are urgently required to determine whether randomised controlled trials comparing medical versus surgical management in patients with recurrent or refractory peptic ulcers or both are necessary. Such studies will also provide information for the design of such randomised controlled trials. A minimum follow-up of two to three years will allow the calculation of the incidence of complications and gastric cancer (in gastric ulcers only) in recurrent and refractory peptic ulcers. In addition to complications related to treatment and disease, health-related quality of life and loss of productivity should also be measured.

2024. 27195 A peptic ulcer is a break in the lining of the lower esophagus, stomach, or upper small intestine. The 2 most common types of peptic ulcers are gastric ulcers, which occur in the stomach, and duodenal ulcers, which occur in the upper part of the small intestine. About 1% of the US population has peptic ulcer disease, and an estimated 10 000 people in the US die of peptic ulcer disease each year.

1. Infection with a bacterium called Helicobacter pylori causes about 42% of peptic ulcers, although only 10% of people with H pylori develop a peptic ulcer. About 36% of peptic ulcers are associated with use of a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug such as aspirin or ketorolac.

In addition, cigarette smoking, psychological stress, family history of peptic ulcer disease, and adverse childhood circumstances such as crowded living conditions and poor water quality can increase the risk of peptic ulcer disease. Some people with peptic ulcer disease have no symptoms, but about 81% of people with peptic ulcers have upper abdominal pain or discomfort, called dyspepsia. With duodenal ulcers, the abdominal pain may improve immediately after eating but typically worsens 2 to 3 hours later. Heartburn or acid regurgitation occurs in about 46% of people with peptic ulcers, and 29% have bleeding ulcers. Complications of peptic ulcer disease include gastrointestinal bleeding, which may lead to vomiting blood; obstruction, which prevents food from passing through the stomach and causes abdominal pain, bloating, and recurrent vomiting; and ulcer perforation, which causes sudden, severe pain and can lead to shock and death if not treated with emergency surgery.

The primary treatment for peptic ulcer disease is use of a proton pump inhibitor drug such as omeprazole or lansoprazole to decrease stomach acid and allow the lining of the stomach or duodenum to heal. Most ulcers heal within 4 weeks, but those larger than 2 cm may take 8 weeks to resolve. Antacids are appropriate only for temporary symptom relief.

### Helicobacter pylori: consensus and controversy [^cff95702]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

Helicobacter pylori is uniquely adapted to colonize the human stomach. Infection leads to a range of subclinical and clinical outcomes that depend on properties of the infecting strain, the host, and the environment. Eradication therapy is indicated for infected persons who develop peptic ulcer disease or gastric lymphoma or who are beginning long-term treatment with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. However, treatment may worsen gastroesophageal reflux disease and increase the risk of esophageal cancer. H. pylori infections can be diagnosed noninvasively and can be eradicated with approximately 85% success by a variety of multidrug, 7-14-day regimens. Unfortunately, antibiotic resistance is affecting treatment effectiveness in the United States and abroad. A more complete understanding of the variation in H. pylori pathogenesis should lead to clearer recommendations about treatment for infected persons who have neither peptic ulcer disease nor gastric lymphoma.

### East Asian-specific and cross-ancestry genome-wide meta-analyses provide mechanistic insights into peptic ulcer disease [^157180f6]. Nature Genetics (2023). High credibility.

Main

PUD refers to the acid-induced injury of the digestive tract, occurring mainly in the stomach (GU) or proximal segment of the duodenum (DU) with bleeding, perforation or gastric outlet obstruction as the major complication. PUD is one of the most common gastrointestinal disorders, with a lifetime prevalence rate of approximately 5–10% in the general population. The prevalence of PUD has been reported to be substantially higher in east Asians (EAS) than Europeans (EUR), with GU being more common than DU in the Japanese population and DU being more common in Europeans.

With HP infection and the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) being two of the most common causes of GUs and DUs, genetic factors also play a critical role in the development of PUD. Previous genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of PUD had identified multiple loci, mainly HP related, in Europeans. Given the relatively high prevalence of PUD and HP infection in east Asians and the remarkably limited number of risk loci identified in east Asian populations, GWASs with a larger sample size of EAS ancestry individuals would be required to enhance our understanding of genetic etiology of PUD. As GUs and DUs differ in various aspects, such as the proportion of ulcers that are attributable to HP infection, the genetic differences across PUD subtypes and the key cell types involved in their etiology should be investigated. Epidemiological studies have suggested that DU is a protective factor against gastric cancer (GC). However, whether genetic factors for PUD and GC are concordant and can explain the epidemiological findings remain unclear. Therefore, we anticipated that large-scale genetic studies of PUD could not only expand our understanding of PUD biology but also provide insights into the genetic factors that interact with HP or lead to different outcomes of PUD or GC, potentially enabling a more accurate prediction of individual risk in clinical settings.

To address these issues, we conducted a large east Asian-specific and cross-ancestry genome-wide analysis of PUD and PUD subtypes along with four Japanese studies and two European cohorts totaling 52,032 PUD cases and 905,344 controls.

### Double-blind randomized trials of single-tablet ibuprofen / high-dose famotidine vs. ibuprofen alone for reduction of gastric and duodenal ulcers [^c9e5210b]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

The two different primary end points in the individual studies were chosen to address both the more clinically relevant end point of upper GI ulcers (gastric and/or duodenal) and the traditional US FDA (Food and Drug Administration) end point of gastric ulcers. In clinical practice, physicians and patients are concerned about preventing ulcers, whether they are gastric or duodenal, and many clinical trials use this primary end point. However, the FDA generally has approved antisecretory medications for prevention of gastric ulcers (e.g. lansoprazole and esomeprazole). These two trials were designed to be used for registration, and, in pretrial meetings, the FDA agreed to the use of the different end points in the two trials.

Comparison between treatment arms of the crude proportions of patients with ulcers at 24 weeks with a Cochran–Mantel–Haenszel test stratified by the two randomization risk factor strata (use of low-dose aspirin and other anticoagulants, prior ulcer history) was specified as the primary statistical analysis at the time of sample size calculation and study initiation. Before study termination and unblinding, the primary analysis was changed to a comparison between treatment arms of the life table estimates of the proportion of patients with ulcers at 24 weeks employing a modified χ² using the sum of squares from the life table in the error term, with the comparison of crude proportions using the Cochran–Mantel–Haenszel test maintained as a secondary analysis. Numbers-needed-to-treat (NNTs) and absolute risk reductions were calculated using crude proportions.

### Peptic ulcer disease [^748a2eb1]. Lancet (2024). Excellent credibility.

Annual prevalence estimates of peptic ulcer disease range between 0·12% and 1·5%. Peptic ulcer disease is usually attributable to Helicobacter pylori infection, intake of some medications (such as aspirin and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications), or being critically ill (stress-related), or it can be idiopathic. The clinical presentation is usually uncomplicated, with peptic ulcer disease management based on eradicating H pylori if present, the use of acid-suppressing medications-most often proton pump inhibitors (PPIs)-or addressing complications, such as with early endoscopy and high-dose PPIs for peptic ulcer bleeding. Special considerations apply to patients on antiplatelet and antithrombotic agents. H pylori treatment has evolved, with the choice of regimen dictated by local antibiotic resistance patterns. Indications for primary and secondary prophylaxis vary across societies; most suggest PPIs for patients at highest risk of developing a peptic ulcer, its complications, or its recurrence. Additional research areas include the use of potassium-competitive acid blockers and H pylori vaccination; the optimal approach for patients at risk of stress ulcer bleeding requires more robust determinations of optimal patient selection and treatment selection, if any. Appropriate continuation of PPI use outweighs most possible side-effects if given for approved indications, while de-prescribing should be trialled when a definitive indication is no longer present.

### Effects of gastroprotectant drugs for the prevention and treatment of peptic ulcer disease and its complications: a meta-analysis of randomised trials [^c304157f]. The Lancet: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2018). Medium credibility.

Summary

Background

Gastroprotectant drugs are used for the prevention and treatment of peptic ulcer disease and might reduce its associated complications, but reliable estimates of the effects of gastroprotectants in different clinical settings are scarce. We aimed to examine the effects of proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs), prostaglandin analogues, and histamine-2 receptor antagonists (H2RAs) in different clinical circumstances by doing meta-analyses of tabular data from all relevant unconfounded randomised trials of gastroprotectant drugs.

Methods

We searched MEDLINE and Embase from Jan 1, 1950, to Dec 31, 2015, to identify unconfounded, randomised trials of a gastroprotectant drug (defined as a PPI, prostaglandin analogue, or H2RA) versus control, or versus another gastroprotectant. Two independent researchers reviewed the search results and extracted the prespecified outcomes and key characteristics for each trial. We did meta-analyses of the effects of gastroprotectant drugs on ulcer development, bleeding, and mortality overall, according to the class of gastroprotectant, and according to the individual drug within a gastroprotectant class.

Findings

We identified comparisons of gastroprotectant versus control in 849 trials (142 485 participants): 580 prevention trials (110 626 participants), 233 healing trials (24 033 participants), and 36 trials for the treatment of acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding (7826 participants). Comparisons of one gastroprotectant drug versus another were available in 345 trials (64 905 participants), comprising 160 prevention trials (32 959 participants), 167 healing trials (28 306 participants), and 18 trials for treatment of acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding (3640 participants). The median number of patients in each trial was 78 (IQR 44·0–210·5) and the median duration was 1·4 months (0·9–2·8). In prevention trials, gastroprotectant drugs reduced development of endoscopic ulcers (odds ratio [OR] 0·27, 95% CI 0·25–0·29; p < 0·0001), symptomatic ulcers (0·25, 0·22–0·29; p < 0·0001), and upper gastrointestinal bleeding (0·40, 0·32–0·50; p < 0·0001), but did not significantly reduce mortality (0·85, 0·69–1·04; p = 0·11). Larger proportional reductions in upper gastrointestinal bleeding were observed for PPIs than for other gastroprotectant drugs (PPIs 0·21, 99% CI 0·12–0·36; prostaglandin analogues 0·63, 0·35–1·12; H2RAs 0·49, 0·30–0·80; p het = 0·0005). Gastroprotectant drugs were effective in preventing bleeding irrespective of the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (p het = 0·56). In healing trials, gastroprotectants increased endoscopic ulcer healing (3·49, 95% CI 3·28–3·72; p < 0·0001), with PPIs more effective (5·22, 99% CI 4·00–6·80) than prostaglandin analogues (2·27, 1·91–2·70) and H2RAs (3·80, 3·44–4·20; p het < 0·0001). In trials among patients with acute bleeding, gastroprotectants reduced further bleeding (OR 0·68, 95% CI 0·60–0·78; p < 0·0001), blood transfusion (0·75, 0·65–0·88; p = 0·0003), further endoscopic intervention (0·56, 0·45–0·70; p < 0·0001), and surgery (0·72, 0·61–0·84; p < 0·0001), but did not significantly reduce mortality (OR 0·90, 0·72–1·11; p = 0·31). PPIs had larger protective effects than did H2RAs for further bleeding (p het = 0·0107) and blood transfusion (p het = 0·0130).

Interpretation

Gastroprotectants, in particular PPIs, reduce the risk of peptic ulcer disease and its complications and promote healing of peptic ulcers in a wide range of clinical circumstances. However, this meta-analysis might have overestimated the benefits owing to small study bias.

### Helicobacter pylori infection [^265bda0c]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2023). High credibility.

Helicobacter pylori infection causes chronic gastritis, which can progress to severe gastroduodenal pathologies, including peptic ulcer, gastric cancer and gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma. H. pylori is usually transmitted in childhood and persists for life if untreated. The infection affects around half of the population in the world but prevalence varies according to location and sanitation standards. H. pylori has unique properties to colonize gastric epithelium in an acidic environment. The pathophysiology of H. pylori infection is dependent on complex bacterial virulence mechanisms and their interaction with the host immune system and environmental factors, resulting in distinct gastritis phenotypes that determine possible progression to different gastroduodenal pathologies. The causative role of H. pylori infection in gastric cancer development presents the opportunity for preventive screen-and-treat strategies. Invasive, endoscopy-based and non-invasive methods, including breath, stool and serological tests, are used in the diagnosis of H. pylori infection. Their use depends on the specific individual patient history and local availability. H. pylori treatment consists of a strong acid suppressant in various combinations with antibiotics and/or bismuth. The dramatic increase in resistance to key antibiotics used in H. pylori eradication demands antibiotic susceptibility testing, surveillance of resistance and antibiotic stewardship.

### Eradication therapy for peptic ulcer disease in Helicobacter pylori-positive people [^5acc2a04]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Peptic ulcer disease is the cause of dyspepsia in about 10% of people. Ninety-five percent of duodenal and 70% of gastric ulcers are associated with Helicobacter pylori. Eradication of H. pylori reduces the relapse rate of ulcers but the magnitude of this effect is uncertain. This is an update of Ford AC, Delaney B, Forman D, Moayyedi P. Eradication therapy for peptic ulcer disease in Helicobacter pylori-positive patients. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews 2006, Issue 2. Art. No.: CD003840. DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD003840.pub4.

Objectives

To assess the proportion of peptic ulcers healed and the proportion of participants who remained free from relapse with eradication therapy against placebo or other pharmacological therapies in H. pylori-positive people. To assess the proportion of participants that achieved complete relief of symptoms and improvement in quality of life scores. To compare the incidence of adverse effects/drop-outs (total number for each drug) associated with the different treatments. To assess the proportion of participants in whom successful eradication was achieved.

Search Methods

In this update, we identified trials by searching the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Ovid MEDLINE (1950 to March 2016) and Ovid EMBASE (1980 to March 2016). To identify further relevant trials, we handsearched reference lists from trials selected by electronic searching, and published abstracts from conference proceedings from the United European Gastroenterology Week (published in Gut) and Digestive Disease Week (published in Gastroenterology). The search was last updated in March 2016. We contacted members of Cochrane Upper GI and Pancreatic Diseases, and experts in the field and asked them to provide details of outstanding clinical trials and any relevant unpublished materials.

Selection Criteria

We analysed randomised controlled trials of short- and long-term treatment of peptic ulcer disease in H. pylori-positive adults. Participants received at least one week of H. pylori eradication compared with ulcer healing drug, placebo or no treatment. Trials were included if they reported assessment from two weeks onwards.

Data Collection and Analysis

We collected data on ulcer healing, recurrence, relief of symptoms and adverse effects. We calculated the risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) using both fixed-effect and random-effects models with Review Manager software (RevMan 5.3) based on intention-to-treat analysis as far as possible.

Main Results

A total of 55 trials were included for one or more outcomes for this review. In duodenal ulcer healing, eradication therapy was superior to ulcer healing drug (UHD) (34 trials, 3910 participants, RR of ulcer persisting = 0.66, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.58 to 0.76; 381/2286 (adjusted proportion: 12.4%) in eradication therapy plus UHD versus 304/1624 (18.7%) in UHD; low quality evidence) and no treatment (two trials, 207 participants, RR 0.37, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.53; 30/125 (adjusted proportion: 21.7%) in eradication therapy versus 48/82 (58.5%) in no treatment; low quality evidence). In gastric ulcer healing, the differences were imprecise between eradication therapy and UHD (15 trials, 1974 participants, RR 1.23, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.68; 220/1192 (adjusted proportion: 16.0%) in eradication therapy plus UHD versus 102/782 (13.0%) in UHD; very low quality evidence). In preventing duodenal ulcer recurrence the differences were imprecise between maintenance therapy with H.pylori eradication therapy and maintenance therapy with UHD (four trials, 319 participants, RR of ulcer recurring 0.73; 95% CI 0.42 to 1.25; 19/159 (adjusted proportion: 11.9%) in eradication therapy versus 26/160 (16.3%) in UHD; very low quality evidence), but eradication therapy was superior to no treatment (27 trials 2509 participants, RR 0.20, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.26; 215/1501 (adjusted proportion: 12.9%) in eradication therapy versus 649/1008 (64.4%) in no treatment; very low quality evidence). In preventing gastric ulcer recurrence, eradication therapy was superior to no treatment (12 trials, 1476 participants, RR 0.31, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.45; 116/697 (adjusted proportion: 16.3%) in eradication therapy versus 356/679 (52.4%) in no treatment; very low quality evidence). None of the trials reported proportion of people with gastric ulcer not healed after initial therapy between H.pylori eradication therapy and no active treatment or the proportion of people with recurrent gastric ulcer or peptic ulcers during maintenance therapy between H.pylori eradication therapy and ulcer healing drug therapy.

Authors' Conclusions

Adding a one to two-week course of H. pylori eradication therapy is an effective treatment for people with H. pylori-positive duodenal ulcer when compared to ulcer healing drugs alone and no treatment. H. pylori eradication therapy is also effective in preventing recurrence of duodenal and gastric ulcer compared to no treatment. There is currently no evidence that H. pylori eradication therapy is an effective treatment in people with gastric ulcer or that it is effective in preventing recurrence of duodenal ulcer compared to ulcer healing drug. However, confidence intervals were wide and significant benefits or harms of H. pylori eradication therapy in acute ulcer healing of gastric ulcers compared to no treatment, and in preventing recurrence of duodenal ulcers compared to ulcer healing drugs cannot be ruled out.

### Kyoto global consensus report on Helicobacter pylori gastritis [^b1820189]. Gut (2015). Low credibility.

Comment

H. pylori is a major human pathogen that causes chronic and progressive gastric mucosal damage and is aetiologically related to peptic ulcer, gastric cancer and gastric atrophy. It is also closely associated with gastric MALT lymphoma, dyspepsia, hyperplastic gastric polyps and idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura. H. pylori -positive individuals are also the major reservoir for transmission of the infection.

The decision to eradicate a chronic infection in a society should be based on quantitative data regarding the outcome of untreated infections. H. pylori causes a chronic infection, similar, for example, to asymptomatic syphilis or tuberculosis, and the final outcome for any individual cannot be predicted. H. pylori infection differs from many other chronic infectious diseases because it is always transmissible, thus putting others at risk. Because the gastric damage is progressive, the lack of an obvious clinical manifestation at diagnosis has no predictive value for life-time risk to an individual patient, their family or to the community. Benefits of H. pylori eradication for an individual depend in part on the degree and extent of damage that has already occurred and the reversibility of that damage. Potential benefits of eradication include stopping the progression of mucosal damage, stabilisation or reduction in risk of developing gastric cancer, resolution of mucosal inflammation, stabilisation or improvement of gastric mucosal function, return of the normal mechanisms governing acid secretion, cure of H. pylori -related PUD, reduction in risk of gastrointestinal complications of NSAID therapy and prevention of future development of H. pylori -related peptic ulcer.

For society, the benefits include reduction of the reservoir of infected individuals capable of transmitting the infection to others, and avoidance of the costs associated with diagnosis, management and outcomes of H. pylori -related diseases that are prevented. Thus, H. pylori -infected patients should be offered eradication therapy unless there are competing considerations such as comorbidities, re-infection rates in their communities, competing health priorities of society and financial cost. It has to be remembered, however, that there are concerns about the negative impact of eradication therapies on human health, such as increase in allergy or obesity and perturbation of microbiota.

CQ18. What is the optimal timing for H. pylori eradication in asymptomatic subjects?

Statement 18

The maximum benefit of H. pylori eradication is obtained if it is done while the mucosal damage is still non-atrophic.

Grade of recommendation: strong

Evidence level: high

Consensus level: 100%

### The global, regional and national burden of peptic ulcer disease from 1990 to 2019: a population-based study [^afcf66d4]. BMC Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Peptic ulcer disease (PUD), a common disorder of the digestive system, is defined as digestive tract injury that results in a mucosal break greater than 3–5 mm, with a visible depth reaching the submucosa. Mainly occurring in the stomach and proximal duodenum, PUD accounts for an estimated lifetime prevalence of 5–10% and an annual incidence of 0.1–0.3% in the general population in Western countries. Due to nonspecific symptoms, PUD assessment and treatment requires clinical caution due to severe complications such as bleeding, perforation, penetration into adjacent organs and gastrointestinal obstruction, all of which could require acute endoscopic or surgical treatment.

Similar to several digestive disorders, the prevalence of PUD initially increased and then subsequently decreased. Jennings et al. analyzed PUD epidemiological data spanning 150 years and found that the incidence of and mortality due to PUD increased markedly during the nineteenth century and then decreased steadily due to improvements in environmental hygiene and medical therapeutic strategies. During the first 50 years of the twentieth century in the United States, PUD affected approximately 10% of the adult population. Several studies which were conducted in the past 20–30 years indicated a sharp decreasing tendency in the PUD prevalence, PUD-related hospital admissions and PUD-associated mortality due to new anti-PUD therapies application, such as Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) eradication and proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) using. However, the widespread use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), histamine 2 receptor antagonists, and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, as well as increased physiological stress, have been reported as risk factors and have changed the landscape of PUD in recent years. The details of the epidemiological changes caused by these relatively new risk factors are still controversial.

In this study, we analyzed PUD burdens in 204 countries or territories from 1990 to 2019 based on data from the Global Burden of Disease, Injuries and Risk Factors (GBD) Study, which is updated in 2020 and contains epidemiological and socioeconomic data of 354 diseases globally, allowing evaluations of the burdens, distributions and trends of PUD in different regions. Our study aims to investigate the current landscape and changes in the epidemiological characteristics of PUD to support healthcare-associated policy makers in developing improved PUD prevention strategies.

### Ulcers and gastritis [^5e9258da]. Endoscopy (2004). Low credibility.

Significant advances continue to be made in the area of gastritis and ulcer disease. Studies to identify the most appropriate use of capsule endoscopy have now confirmed that it is superior to other methods for identifying small-bowel mucosal pathology and sites of obscure gastrointestinal bleeding. It has increasingly been recognized that the complications of ulcer disease are secondary to the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and to interactions between NSAIDs and Helicobacter pylori. Effective prophylaxis for NSAID ulcers in H. pylori-negative individuals continues to be a challenge, as it has become clear that conclusions from studies focusing on "endoscopic ulcers" in patients whose H. pylori status was unknown provided a false sense of security. The concept of multifocal atrophic gastritis has been challenged. The precursor lesion to gastric cancer now appears to be a sheet of pseudopyloric metaplasia advancing into the gastric body with islands of intestinal metaplasia embedded within it. Multifactorial models such as those proposed for understanding periodontal disease, including the organism, environmental factors, and host factors, appear particularly applicable to understanding the pathogenesis of H. pylori-associated gastric cancer.

### Peptic ulcer and Helicobacter pylori [^98c871e0]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2000). Low credibility.

Although there has been an explosion of data not only since the discovery of H. pylori in 1982, but also since the first comprehensive review of H. pylori in the Gastroenterology Clinics in 1993, much remains to be learned. In 1993, there were many skeptics doubting the importance of H. pylori in ulcer disease. Although this skepticism has dissipated, many ulcer patients infected with H. pylori still do not receive appropriate therapy. This situation possibly relates to the safety, efficacy, and simplicity of prescribing acid-suppressive therapy in contrast to the confusion regarding anti-H. pylori treatment regimens. Among the many continuing unanswered questions regarding the role of H. pylori and PUD are the still enigmatic nature of host, environmental, and H. pylori-related factors that determine outcome. Why do only some infected individuals (and why do more men than women) develop PUD, and what determines whether gastric ulcers or duodenal ulcers develop? What is the explanation for the seasonal variation in ulcer disease? Although PUD is an infectious disease, are other environmental factors critical for the manifestation of ulcers in association with infection? What factors govern the outcome of the combination of H. pylori infection and NSAID use? Has attention been too focused first on the pathophysiology of acid secretion and now on H. pylori? In curing H. pylori in association with PUD, are clinicians going to displace disease northward, substituting erosions, inflammation, and neoplasia (and associated symptoms) in the esophagus and gastroesophageal junction for an ulcer crater (and its associated symptoms) in the duodenum or stomach? The epidemiology of PUD is changing — in more recent reports of ulcer patients, H. pylori and NSAID use are less prevalent than in earlier reports. These questions and comments should not be misinterpreted as advocating a lack of aggressiveness in diagnosis and treatment of H. pylori in the setting of PUD, however.

### AGA clinical practice update on high-quality upper endoscopy: expert review [^8eaf63ab]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2024). High credibility.

AGA high-quality upper endoscopy — peptic ulcer disease biopsy protocol — If gastric ulcer biopsies are performed, then biopsy specimens should be taken from base and edges of the ulcer, and biopsy the remainder of the stomach for H pylori as previously described; routine biopsies of duodenal ulcers are not necessary. Decision on biopsy of gastric ulcers may be individualized, and if very low risk of gastric cancer based on patient history and demographics (eg, young non- Hispanic white patient taking nonsteroidal anti- inflammatory drugs) and ulcer appearance (eg, shallow, flat ulcer with associated erosions), biopsy may not be necessary.

### Time trends of ulcer mortality in Europe [^938f254a]. Gastroenterology (2007). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

The aim of the present study was to follow the time trends of ulcer disease in a representative sample of European countries and assess whether the most recent behavior of peptic ulcer still fits the overall pattern governed by an underlying birth-cohort phenomenon.

Methods

Mortality data from 6 countries between 1921 and 2004 were analyzed, including Denmark, France, Germany, The Netherlands, Spain, and Switzerland. The age-specific death rates of gastric and duodenal ulcers from each individual country were plotted as period-age and cohort-age contours.

Results

The data from the past 50–80 years show striking similarities among the 6 European countries. In all countries alike, the risk of dying from gastric and duodenal ulcer increased among consecutive generations born during the second half of the 19th century until shortly before the turn of the century, and then decreased in all subsequent generations. The time trends of gastric ulcer preceded those of duodenal ulcer by 10–30 years. The increase in nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug consumption or introduction of potent antisecretory medications have not affected the long-term downward trends of ulcer mortality. The birth-cohort pattern has continued to influence the temporal variations of peptic ulcer until most recently.

Conclusions

The unique shape of the birth-cohort patterns of gastric and duodenal ulcers and their identical appearance in countries with different health care systems and varying political and socioeconomic histories reflect the overriding influence of Helicobacter pylori infection.

### Effects of gastroprotectant drugs for the prevention and treatment of peptic ulcer disease and its complications: a meta-analysis of randomised trials [^133f585e]. The Lancet: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2018). Medium credibility.

Added value of the study

This meta-analysis of more than 1200 trials included around 200 000 participants and quantified the relative treatment effects of available gastroprotectants in the settings of ulcer prevention, ulcer healing, and treatment of acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding. The findings provide evidence for benefits of gastroprotectant therapy in all three clinical contexts, with PPIs showing consistent superiority to other agents. The relative benefits of gastroprotectants were of broadly similar magnitude irrespective of whether patients were taking NSAIDs. In the absence of large-scale randomised trials, however, some uncertainty remains about whether the effect size estimates in this meta-analysis were inflated by small study bias, and insufficient reliable information is available on the safety of such treatments.

Implications of all the available evidence

This study indicates that, in the context of peptic ulcer disease, gastroprotectants — and in particular PPIs — are effective in ulcer prevention, ulcer healing, and in reducing rebleeding. The relative benefits appear similar irrespective of concomitant NSAID use. Reliable information is still needed about the long-term safety of PPIs; in particular, there is concern that PPIs might have adverse cardiovascular effects. The large ongoing COMPASS trial of pantoprazole versus placebo in 17 000 patients with stable cardiovascular disease might provide useful safety information, and could also help to determine the true size of any beneficial effects.

The most frequent causes of peptic ulcer disease are Helicobacter pylori infection and the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), including aspirin.NSAIDs are among the most widely used drugs in the world and are known to substantially increase the risk of upper gastrointestinal complications(probably as a consequence of inhibited mucosal prostaglandin production). Optimal use of gastroprotectant drugs might therefore help to reduce the global burden of peptic ulcer disease and its complications. Clinical guidelines currently recommend that PPIs are used as first-choice gastroprotectant drugs, supported by systematic reviews and meta-analyses in particular clinical settings, but to date no comprehensive effort has been made to bring together all of the evidence from randomised trials of gastroprotectant drugs in different clinical contexts. In particular, reliable estimates of the effects of different gastroprotectant drugs in specific clinical circumstances (eg, in the context of prevention, healing, or acute bleeding), at different anatomical locations (gastric or duodenal), and according to concomitant NSAID use are not available.

### Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug gastropathy and Helicobacter pylori: the search for an improbable consensus [^6e5bac77]. The American Journal of Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and Helicobacter pylori are known to share a number of pathogenic mechanisms, but there is no evidence to show a significant synergistic action between these two risk factors. Studies to assess possible interactions in the pathogenesis of dyspepsia and upper gastrointestinal mucosal lesions have differed in their endpoints, the definition of dyspepsia, and the regimens used for eradication of H. pylori. However, some conclusions may be drawn from the results of clinical trials. As far as dyspepsia is concerned, an association between NSAID dyspepsia and infection with H. pylori, seems likely, but it is difficult to make sense of the discrepant data that are currently available. On the contrary, neither short- nor long-term NSAID administration presents a definite major risk of gastric and duodenal injury or, above all, of ulcer-related complications (bleeding or perforation) in H. pylori-positive patients. Based on these considerations, what recommendations can be made with regard to H. pylori eradication in patients requiring treatment with NSAIDs? H. pylori and anti-inflammatory drugs are probably independent causes of gastric and duodenal damage. Patients taking NSAIDs who are found to have gastric or duodenal ulcers should, therefore, be tested for the bacterium and specifically treated, because H. pylori and NSAID-induced ulcers may be macroscopically indistinguishable. Whether asymptomatic patients taking NSAIDs should be tested and treated for H. pylori infection is still a matter of debate.

Table
Availability of data for measuring the effects of gastroprotectants

In prevention trials, we found that overall, compared with control, allocation to a gastroprotectant drug resulted in a substantial reduction in the odds of an endoscopic ulcer (OR 0·27 [95% CI 0·25–0·29]; absolute benefit 160 events [151–168] avoided per 1000 patients allocated treatment; p < 0·0001). PPIs appeared to be more effective (OR 0·20 [99% CI 0·17–0·23]) than prostaglandin analogues (0·26 [0·20–0·32]) or H2RAs (0·32 [0·28–0·35]; p het < 0·0001; figure 2). The relative effectiveness of particular gastroprotectant classes on duodenal ulcers and gastric ulcers also differed significantly: for trials of a gastroprotectant versus control in duodenal ulcer prevention, PPIs were the most effective gastroprotectant class, followed by H2RAs and finally prostaglandin analogues (figure 2), which was consistent with the ordering implied by the results of trials comparing one gastroprotectant class with another gastroprotectant class (appendix p 3). For prevention of gastric ulcers, however, the analogous ordering of effectiveness was prostaglandin analogues, followed by PPIs and finally H2RAs, and this was again consistent with the ordering implied by the results of trials directly comparing different gastroprotectant classes. PPIs were more effective at reducing the risk of duodenal ulcers than of gastric ulcers (p < 0·0001; figure 2).

### Perforated peptic ulcer [^9eed04ae]. Lancet (2015). Excellent credibility.

Pathogenesis, aetiology and risk factors for perforation

While an overall imbalance between the protective and the ulcerogenic factors is obvious in ulcer formation, it is unclear why some patients perforate and others do not. The ulcerogenesis involves infection (H. pylori), mucosal barrier injury (e.g. use of drugs) and increased acid-production (figure 2). However, the exact risk-estimates and contribution of each factor is still poorly understood. Only about a third of patients with PPU have a previous history of or current known peptic ulcer at time of diagnosis. Further, some patients develop very small (< 5 mm) perforations without large mucosal defects, which suggest ulcer size to be unrelated to perforation risk, while other patients may develop large mucosal defects with perforation of several centimetres.

The putative pathogenesis and role of Helicobacter virulence factors is reviewed extensively elsewhere. About 50% of the global population is colonized by H. pylori in the gastric mucosa, yet it causes disease in only 10–20%. H. pylori shows a variable prevalence (0–90%) in perforated ulcers, and ulcers may also develop in the absence of H. pylori infection and NSAIDs use. Notably, cofactors such as smoking and alcohol are found across studies from different regions (figure 2).

The perforation frequency follows in part the geographic distribution patterns of H. pylori, with duodenal perforations being more common in regions with a predominant H. pylori aetiology. One study suggested a higher density of H. pylori with perforations, pointing to a potential 'dose effect' that leads to perforation. The virulence of H. pylori may also contribute, as different strains appear to have variable pathogenic influence. Further, it is important to remember that PPU also may occur in children, where it is usually associated with H. pylori (90%). In parallel to the drop in the prevalence of H. pylori in many western countries (estimated at 20–30%), a change from predominantly duodenal ulcers to gastric ulcers seen in the elderly is attributed to increased NSAID use in this population.

### Accuracy of thediagnostic tests in patients with peptic ulcer bleeding: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^ba3ffbe1]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Materials and methods

Protocol

A diagnostic accuracy meta-analysis and systematic review were planned using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) protocols for DTA studies. The analysis was registered in advance on PROSPERO with registration number CRD42019113083, and the protocol was later updated as a network meta-analysis due to the significant variation between the comparisons of testing strategies.

Data sources and searches

We included studies from adult populations with PUB where index tests were compared with reference tests for identifying HPI. The outcomes were the diagnostic performance measures of the different diagnostic tests.

A systematic search was conducted in seven databases: Medline via PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO Global Health Library, Web of Science, Scopus, from inception to 1 November 2019. There were no restrictions or filters imposed on the search strategy apart from human studies.

Keywords for the computer-aided search were (bleed* OR haemorrhage OR hemorrhage OR haematemesis OR hematemesis OR melaena OR melena) AND ('upper gastrointestinal' OR 'upper GI' OR nonvariceal OR peptic OR gastric OR duodenal OR gastroduodenal OR antrum OR antral OR pylorus OR pyloric OR GU OR DU OR PU OR ulcer OR stomach OR curling) AND (helicobacter OR pylori). Additional articles were identified from the reference lists of primarily eligible studies.

Study selection

Records were managed by EndNote X7.4, software (Clarivate Analytics, Philadelphia, PA, USA). After exclusion of duplicates, the remaining studies were screened by title, abstract and finally by full text by two independent authors (NV, ME). Additional articles were searched manually and identified from the reference lists of primarily eligible studies. We calculated Cohen's kappa coefficient to measure the agreement between two raters (NV, ME) in three levels (title, abstract and full text) of the selection process. Disagreements were resolved by consensus and the involvement of the senior reviewer (BE).

Eligibility criteria

All prospective, cross-sectional DTA studies with relevant information about the accuracy of any HPI diagnostic test without language restriction were included in our analysis. Articles without direct or indirect information on the true positives (TP), true negatives (TN), false positives (FP) and false negatives (FN) were excluded from the analysis. Conference abstracts were excluded after we discovered they did not contain enough information.

### Ulcers and gastritis [^88655612]. Endoscopy (2003). Low credibility.

This article reviews recently published literature regarding ulcers and gastritis. Although endoscopy is the most useful procedure for diagnosis in the upper gastrointestinal tract, complications do occur, and procedure-related costs are significant. The appropriate indication for endoscopy has recently been debated. Helicobacter pylori is known to be an important pathogen involved in gastric and duodenal inflammation. Peptic ulcer disease and severe gastric mucosal injury are caused by virulent strains, and many reports have focused on CagA. Follow-up studies on surveillance endoscopy in patients with peptic ulcer or gastritis report that patients with atrophic gastritis and intestinal metaplasia are at significantly higher risk for gastric cancer. H. pylori eradication sometimes causes gastroduodenal erosion and reflux esophagitis, and the mechanisms involved have been revealed. Proton-pump inhibitors are useful in the treatment of ulcers caused by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), reflux esophagitis, and for preventing rebleeding after endoscopic hemostasis, but the effect of long-term acid suppression on the gastric mucosa is still a matter of debate. H. pylori infection and NSAID intake are both risk factors for peptic ulcer disease, and are important aspects in this field.

### Medical management of acid-peptic disorders of the stomach [^0bbddf2d]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

In the past 30 years, medicine has witnessed an unprecedented evolution in acid-peptic disorder management, fueled by major advances in our understanding of the physiology of acid secretion and the gastric mucosal barrier. The other pivotal development in understanding these disorders has been the recognition of Helicobacter pylori's role in the pathophysiology of peptic ulcer disease, chronic gastritis, and even gastric malignancy. This evolution continues as H pylori wanes in significance, and medicine is challenged by treating iatrogenic conditions brought on by ulcerogenic anti-inflammatory drugs. Following a description of the relevant physiology and biochemistry of gastric acid secretion and the gastric mucosal barrier, this article describes the current medicinal arsenal available to treat acid-peptic disorders of the stomach.

### First-line therapies foreradication: a critical reappraisal of updated guidelines [^c1394b7b]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Since the 1990s, different national and international guidelines for the management of patients with H. pylori infection have been introduced and periodically updated. Undeniably, recommendations on some issues are universally applicable to different geographic areas, such as those concerning the indications for treatment, or diagnostic procedures. For instance, H. pylori infection should be searched for in all patients with a peptic ulcer, irrespectively of the country where they are living. Likewise, the accuracy of noninvasive or invasive tests does not change among patients of different geographic areas. Therefore, guidelines on diagnosis and clinical issues may be applicable in all countries. In contrast, the efficacy of a therapy regimen may be affected by local or regional host/bacterial peculiarities. Consequently, recommendations on therapeutic approaches are more appropriately addressed in national rather than international guidelines, provided that data from national studies are considered.

Based on all these considerations, we aimed to examine the most recently updated guidelines worldwide, focusing our attention on first-line therapy recommendations for H. pylori eradication. Specifically, we considered European, NICE, Italian, Spanish American and Canadian guidelines for Western countries, and Asian, Australian, Japanese, and Chinese guidelines for Eastern countries.

### Ulcer and gastritis [^99d2b9af]. Endoscopy (2001). Low credibility.

Recent progress in the area of ulcer and gastritis is still dominated by findings and reports on Helicobacter pylori and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, which in turn are the two major causes of peptic ulcers. Although the prevalence of H. pylori is declining in most developed countries, it is still contributing to a significant proportion of peptic ulcers globally. The interrelationship of H. pylori gastritis in patients with gastroesophageal reflux has become more apparent. H. pylori-induced gastric body gastritis is associated with reduced acid production, and thus with reduced reflux and esophagitis. The controversies regarding the interactions between H. pylori and NSAIDs have still not been settled. With the availability of the new COX-2-specific inhibitors, the current scenario of NSAID-related gastroduodenal complications will certainly change. Short-term usage of these agents has significantly reduced the incidence of endoscopic ulcers, but the benefits in terms of clinical outcomes, such as bleeding or perforation, remain to be determined. This review summarizes the recent literature on peptic ulcer and gastritis.

### Effects of gastroprotectant drugs for the prevention and treatment of peptic ulcer disease and its complications: a meta-analysis of randomised trials [^f5dca579]. The Lancet: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2018). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This meta-analysis of data from more than 1200 randomised trials of the main gastroprotectant drugs currently in use, which included more than 200 000 participants in total, showed that gastroprotectant therapies are effective for the prevention and treatment of peptic ulcer disease and its main complication, upper gastrointestinal bleeding, in a wide range of clinical circumstances. However, the absence of individual trials that recorded large numbers of ulcer complications, and the paucity of reliable information on drug safety, are limitations that constrain wider use of such treatments.

The results of trials of a gastroprotectant versus control, and of one gastroprotectant versus another gastroprotectant of a different class, were consistent, with PPIs being more effective than other classes of gastroprotectant drugs; this superiority was observed uniformly in the separate clinical circumstances in which these agents are used in peptic ulcer disease, namely prevention, healing, and treatment of acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding. In the context of prevention, most information was available from trials assessing the effects of gastroprotectant drugs on endoscopic ulcers, but the evidence of benefit was corroborated by similar findings in the smaller number of trials assessing their effects on symptomatic ulcers. The relative benefits of gastroprotectants for the prevention of endoscopic ulcers, symptomatic ulcers, and bleeding were large and of broadly similar magnitude irrespective of whether patients were taking an NSAID (including aspirin). This result is especially relevant in view of the recent evidence of large excess risks of bleeding in association with aspirin use in the elderly, and hence the potential for wider use of gastroprotectant therapy (eg, PPIs) in this demographic group. Although the absolute risk of developing endoscopic or symptomatic ulcers was actually higher in trials with no concomitant NSAID use than in trials with NSAID use (figure 4; appendix p 7), this is probably due to the fact that many patients classed as not using NSAIDs in these trials had a history of a recently healed ulcer (and hence would be likely to be at higher risk of recurrence of further such events). We found some evidence to suggest that PPIs reduced the risk of duodenal ulcers more than gastric ulcers; however, the relevance of this result is uncertain. There was also a suggestion that prostaglandin analogues are at least as effective as PPIs for the prevention of gastric ulcers; however, the difference between drug classes was not as marked as for duodenal ulcers, and prostaglandin analogues are less well tolerated than PPIs because they cause nausea, diarrhoea, and abdominal pain, as previously highlighted by a Cochrane review on misoprostol.

### Birth cohort patterns of gastric cancer and peptic ulcer among non-whites in the USA [^9a21ed87]. Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health (2011). Low credibility.

Background

The aim of this study was to follow the long-term trends of mortality from gastric cancer, gastric ulcer and duodenal ulcer in the USA. It was hypothesised that the time trends among different ethnic groups would be shaped by similar birth cohort patterns.

Methods

The US ulcer and cancer data were available from 1923 to 2006 and 1930 to 2006, respectively. Age-specific death rates were calculated for consecutive 10-year periods and 10-year age groups, stratified by sex and race. They were plotted against the period of death as period-age contours and against the period of birth as cohort-age contours. The time trends were also summarised as standardised cohort mortality ratios.

Results

The occurrence of birth cohort patterns with an initial rise and a subsequent decline was observed in gastric cancer and both ulcer types. It occurred similarly in white and non-white population, as well as men and women. In all ethnic groups alike, the initial rise in mortality from gastric cancer and gastric ulcer preceded the rise of duodenal ulcer by 10–20 years. The two time lags between gastric cancer and gastric ulcer and between gastric and duodenal ulcer were most pronounced in white patients. In non-white patients, the rise of gastric cancer occurred later than in white patients and coincided with that of gastric ulcer. The initial rise in mortality from gastric cancer was more evident in non-white than in white patients.

Conclusion

The birth cohort pattern has shaped the time trends of Helicobacter pylori-related disease similarly among different ethnic and socioeconomic groups. Its cause remains unknown and warrants further investigation.

### Ulcer disease in the excluded segments after roux-en-Y gastric bypass: a current review of the literature [^1cd1cd50]. Obesity Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Bariatric surgery is the most effective treatment for morbid obesity and results in sustained weight loss and resolution of comorbidities. Over the past decades, the number of performed bariatric operations has been on a constant rise, reaching more than half a million procedures a year worldwide. This number is expected to increase even further, as metabolic surgery is advocated as a treatment option for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in patients with a body mass index (BMI) < 35 kg/m 2.

Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) is one of the most commonly performed procedures, is seen by many as the gold standard treatment in patients with preexisting gastroesophageal reflux disease, and is suggested as the first-choice procedure for patients with T2DM. After the creation of a small gastric pouch, food is diverted away from the stomach directly into the small bowel, and acid produced in the remnant stomach will no longer reach the esophagus anymore. These distinctive changes in anatomy are thought to be key factors for sustained weight loss. However, they also result in the downsides of this procedure, above all hindering access to the biliary tree, the remnant stomach, and the duodenum.

Apparent peptic ulcer disease (PUD) in the excluded stomach or duodenum is rare but leads to severe morbidity and can be life-threatening. The anatomical changes post-RYGB lead to a different clinical presentation in an altered pathophysiological environment. Whereas there are extensive data on marginal ulceration (MU) — ulcers at the gastro-jejunal anastomosis — experience with ulceration in the excluded segments, especially in regard to treatment and prevention, is mostly limited to small series and case reports. Therefore, this review aims to summarize the available data, to contrast existing guidelines to the altered situation post-RYGB and provide treatment recommendations.

### Time trends of ulcer mortality in non-European countries [^655be4c4]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2007). Low credibility.

Aims

The aim of the present study was to follow the time trends of mortality from gastric and duodenal ulcer in countries outside Europe and compare them with previous reports of ulcer mortality from Europe and North America.

Methods

Mortality data from eight different countries were analyzed, including Argentina, Australia, Chile, Hong Kong, Japan, Mexico, Singapore, and Taiwan. The age-standardized death rates of individual countries were followed from 1971 to 2004. Japan and Australia had mortality data for more than 50 yr that provided the opportunity to conduct a birth-cohort analysis.

Results

The data from all countries were characterized by a decline in gastric and duodenal ulcer mortality. Except for Hong Kong, mortality from gastric ulcer was higher than mortality from duodenal ulcer. In Japan and Australia, mortality from gastric and duodenal ulcer displayed time trends that were consistent with an underlying birth-cohort phenomenon. The risk of dying from gastric and duodenal ulcer increased in consecutive generations born between the mid- and the end of the nineteenth century and decreased in all subsequent generations. The peak mortality from gastric ulcer occurred among generations born in 1875, whereas peak mortality from duodenal ulcer occurred among generations born 10–20 yr later.

Conclusions

The ubiquitous decline in ulcer mortality in countries from different parts of the world is likely to be associated with a worldwide decline in the occurrence of H. pylori infection. The events accompanying the receding infection in developed countries must have similarly affected populations exposed to increasing standards of hygiene.

Regarding specific circumstances for peptic ulcer disease, more specifically with respect to patients with gastric outlet obstruction, ASGE 2021 guidelines recommend to insufficient evidence to uniformly support either endoscopic or surgical management in patients with mixed varieties of benign gastric outlet obstruction.

### Pyloric metaplasia, pseudopyloric metaplasia, ulcer-associated cell lineage and spasmolytic polypeptide-expressing metaplasia: reparative lineages in the gastrointestinal mucosa [^16464db5]. The Journal of Pathology (2018). Low credibility.

The gastrointestinal mucosae provide a critical barrier between the external and internal milieu. Thus, damage to the mucosa requires an immediate response to provide appropriate wound closure and healing. Metaplastic lineages with phenotypes similar to the mucous glands of the distal stomach or Brunner's glands have been associated with various injurious scenarios in the stomach, small bowel, and colon. These lineages have been assigned various names including pyloric metaplasia, pseudopyloric metaplasia, ulcer-associated cell lineage (UACL), and spasmolytic polypeptide-expressing metaplasia (SPEM). A re-examination of the literature on these various forms of mucous cell metaplasia suggests that pyloric-type mucosal gland lineages may provide a ubiquitous response to mucosal injury throughout the gastrointestinal tract as well as in the pancreas, esophagus, and other mucosal surfaces. While the cellular origin of these putative reparative lineages likely varies in different regions of the gut, their final phenotypes may converge on a pyloric-type gland dedicated to mucous secretion. In addition to their healing properties in the setting of acute injury, these pyloric-type lineages may also represent precursors to neoplastic transitions in the face of chronic inflammatory influences. Further investigations are needed to determine how discrete molecular profiles relate to the origin and function of pyloric-type metaplasias previously described by histological characteristics in multiple epithelial mucosal systems in the setting of acute and chronic damage.

### Perforated and bleeding peptic ulcer: WSES guidelines [^b22eda7d]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020). High credibility.

Regarding surgical interventions for peptic ulcer disease, more specifically with respect to choice of surgical intervention (perforated ulcer), WSES 2020 guidelines recommend to consider adopting a tailored approach based upon the location of the ulcer for the treatment of patients with perforated peptic ulcer > 2 cm. Consider performing resection with contextual operative frozen pathologic examination whenever possible in case of large gastric ulcers that raise the suspicion of malignancy. Consider performing resections or repair plus/minus pyloric exclusion/external bile drainage in case of large duodenal ulcers. Repair with duodenostomy only in extreme circumstances.

### Reassessment of the predictive value of the forrest classification for peptic ulcer rebleeding and mortality: can classification be simplified? [^a16eeb8b]. Endoscopy (2014). Low credibility.

Background and Study Aims

This study aimed to reassess whether the Forrest classification is still useful for the prediction of rebleeding and mortality in peptic ulcer bleedings and, based on this, whether the classification could be simplified.

Patients and Methods

Prospective registry data on peptic ulcer bleedings were collected and categorized according to the Forrest classification. The primary outcomes were 30-day rebleeding and all-cause mortality rates. Receiver operating characteristic curves were used to test whether simplification of the Forrest classification into high risk (Forrest Ia), increased risk (Forrest Ib-IIc), and low risk (Forrest III) classes could be an alternative to the original classification.

Results

In total, 397 patients were included, with 18 bleedings (4.5%) being classified as Forrest Ia, 73 (18.4%) as Forrest Ib, 86 (21.7%) as Forrest IIa, 32 (8.1%) as Forrest IIb, 59 (14.9%) as Forrest IIc, and 129 (32.5%) as Forrest III. Rebleeding occurred in 74 patients (18.6%). Rebleeding rates were highest in Forrest Ia peptic ulcers (59%). The odds ratios for rebleeding among Forrest Ib-IIc ulcers were similar. In subgroup analysis, predicting rebleeding using the Forrest classification was more reliable for gastric ulcers than for duodenal ulcers. The simplified Forrest classification had similar test characteristics to the original Forrest classification.

Conclusion

The Forrest classification still has predictive value for rebleeding of peptic ulcers, especially for gastric ulcers; however, it does not predict mortality. Based on these results, a simplified Forrest classification is proposed. However, further studies are needed to validate these findings.

### Peptic ulcer disease [^df7060dc]. Lancet (2009). Excellent credibility.

Peptic ulcer disease had a tremendous effect on morbidity and mortality until the last decades of the 20th century, when epidemiological trends started to point to an impressive fall in its incidence. Two important developments are associated with the decrease in rates of peptic ulcer disease: the discovery of effective and potent acid suppressants, and of Helicobacter pylori. With the discovery of H pylori infection, the causes, pathogenesis, and treatment of peptic ulcer disease have been rewritten. We focus on this revolution of understanding and management of peptic ulcer disease over the past 25 years. Despite substantial advances, this disease remains an important clinical problem, largely because of the increasingly widespread use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and low-dose aspirin. We discuss the role of these agents in the causes of ulcer disease and therapeutic and preventive strategies for drug-induced ulcers. The rare but increasingly problematic H pylori-negative NSAID-negative ulcer is also examined.

### Perforated and bleeding peptic ulcer: WSES guidelines [^6105fce8]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

While the treatment of a small ulcer is relatively straightforward, the treatment of giant peptic ulcers (diameter > 2 cm) poses different challenges according to the anatomical location. Furthermore, large gastric ulcers should always raise the suspicion of malignancy. The spontaneous perforation of gastric cancer is a rare complication, occurring in 1% of patients with gastric cancer, and it has been reported that about 10–16% of all gastric perforations are caused by gastric carcinoma. Besides this, there are no specific surgical treatment recommendations since the site of perforation and the secondary effects on the surrounding anatomical structures must direct the necessary interventions. The gastric location is usually easier to treat when compared to the duodenal location and gastric resection and reconstruction should be the surgical choice for the treatment of perforated gastric ulcers larger than 2 cm. On the other hand, only the first portion of the duodenum can be resected easily without risk of injuring the bile duct or the pancreatic head. Antrectomy plus or minus D1–D2 resection with diversion is the classic and most commonly described intervention, if the ampullary region is not involved. The proximity of the defect and its relation to the common bile duct and ampulla of Vater must also be thoroughly investigated and intraoperative cholangiography may even be necessary to verify common bile duct anatomy. Several different procedures, such as a jejunal serosal patch, Roux en-Y duodenojejunostomy, pyloric exclusion, and several variations of omental plugs have been described for large duodenal defects when the defect is felt too large to perform a primary repair. In large ulcers, leak rates up to 12% have been reported from attempted closure with an omental patch procedure. These patients also frequently present in septic shock when the amount of peritoneal spillage is large. This factor alone should significantly influence the choice of operative intervention, because a definitive resectional approach for ulcers involving the ampullary area (i.e. Whipple procedure or similar) is usually not recommended in patients with peritonitis, because of the high physiological impact of these procedures and the great risk of postoperative complications. In these cases, a damage control procedure (such as pyloric exclusion with gastric decompression via a nasogastric tube or a gastrostomy and an external biliary diversion via T-tube) will likely be the safest and most appropriate operation for the patient. Duodenostomy (e.g. over Petzer tube) should be used only as a last resort, in the presence of giant ulcers with severe tissue inflammation and when mobilization of the duodenum is not possible and the patient is in severe septic shock with hemodynamic instability.

### Ulcers and gastritis [^6e554df9]. Endoscopy (2005). Low credibility.

This article reviews recently published reports on ulcers and gastritis. Helicobacter pylori is known to be an important pathogen involved in gastroduodenal inflammation and peptic ulcers. Conventional endoscopy is of limited usefulness in the evaluation of gastritis, but magnifying endoscopy is evidently helpful in the diagnosis of chronic atrophic gastritis, intestinal metaplasia, and H. pylori infection. A significant reduction in the incidence of refractory ulcers and the prevalence of H. pylori infection in patients with peptic ulcer disease followed the introduction of H. pylori eradication treatment. Chronic H. pylori infection is associated with gastric cancer, and the effect of H. pylori eradication on the prevention of gastric cancer is an important issue that is still a matter of controversy. Endoscopic hemostasis and intravenous proton-pump inhibitor (PPI) infusion represent a widely accepted approach to the treatment of peptic ulcer bleeding. In clinical practice, it is important to prevent recurrent bleeding and to treat patients who do not respond to endoscopic therapy or PPI treatment. Laparoscopic repair for peptic ulcer perforations, with postoperative eradication treatment, has gradually met with acceptance in patients with H. pylori infection. H. pylori infection and its treatment continue to be interesting problems in this field.

### Perforated peptic ulcer [^8befaedb]. Lancet (2015). Excellent credibility.

Conclusions and future directions

The paucity in clinical progress and basic understanding of perforated peptic ulcers begs for increased attention in order to reduce morbidity and mortality. Compared to the toll on human health worldwide, there is poor understanding of the pathophysiology underlying perforation, the ability to self-heal and the development of the sepsis syndrome in these patients.

Identification of prognostic factors and pathways of care that may enhance recovery, reduce morbidity and potentially also reduce mortality should be further investigated. Novel techniques may be further explored to seek alternatives to invasive surgical repair. Similarly, some patients with minimal symptoms may also benefit from less invasive therapeutic approaches. However, groups should be investigated in prospective protocols and trials dedicated to find the safest and most efficacious management strategies and the appropriate criteria for selection. Long-term follow up studies with evaluation of quality of life are needed.

### Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs: overall risks and management. complementary roles for COX-2 inhibitors and proton pump inhibitors [^30146076]. Gut (2003). Low credibility.

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are well recognised as causing peptic ulceration and ulcer complications. However, several critical issues, including the amount of both gastrointestinal and non-gastrointestinal disease affected by NSAIDs, their interaction with ancillary risk factors, and how to optimise management in subgroups, remain poorly understood. In this article, strategies for subgroups that take account of non-specific gastrointestinal risks, minimisation of residual risk, and the importance of non-gastrointestinal toxicity are suggested, and areas for research identified.

### Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and the gastrointestinal tract. mechanisms of protection and healing: current knowledge and future research [^a8657bf2]. The American Journal of Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

The resistance of the gastric mucosa to injury is attributable to a series of factors collectively known as "mucosal defense". Many components of mucosal defense are regulated by prostaglandins and nitric oxide (NO). Thus, inhibition of the production of these mediators predisposes the stomach to injury. Administration of these agents, as synthetic prostaglandins or NO donors, can restore mucosal defense and thereby prevent damage induced by several irritants. Repair of gastric ulcers is also influenced by NO and prostaglandins. Furthermore, a variety of growth factors appear to play critical roles in stimulating the formation of granulation tissue (the "foundation" for repair), the formation of new blood vessels, and the proliferation of epithelial cells. Better understanding of the factors that regulate ulcer healing should provide clues for the development of drugs that can produce better "quality" healing of ulcers.

### Perforated and bleeding peptic ulcer: WSES guidelines [^2301446b]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Peptic ulcer disease is still common among the world population and its incidence pattern is evolving in relation to the rise of new risk factors, i.e. the increasing incidence of the Helicobacter pylori infection, the extensive use of NSAIDs and the increase in alcohol and smoking abuse. Despite the tremendous improvement in preventive therapies, the rate of complication of this disease is still high and is burdened by high morbidity and mortality. Prompt recognition and treatment of the complications lead invariably to a better outcome, especially in elderly and frail patients. For this reason, these guidelines present evidence-based international consensus statements on the management of complicated peptic ulcer from a collaboration of a panel of experts and are intended to improve the knowledge and the awareness of physicians around the world on this specific topic. We divided our work into two main topics, bleeding and perforated peptic ulcer, and structured it into six main topics that cover the entire management process of patients with complicated peptic ulcer, from diagnosis at ED arrival to post-discharge antimicrobial therapy, to provide an up-to-date and easy-to-use tool that can help physicians and surgeons during the decision-making process.

### Publications on peptic ulcer in britain, France, Germany and the US [^83caa50e]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

There are no reasonable explanations for the increases first of gastric, and then of duodenal, ulcers in the second half of the nineteenth century. Previous studies have analysed hospital admissions, necropsies and mortality data. This paper uses a novel method, a study of the rates of increases in publications on these peptic ulcers over the centuries in four countries, the US and three in Europe.

Methods

Between 1700 and 1919 the Surgeon General's Catalogues listed 2958 publications on gastric ulcer in Britain, France, Germany and the US, and between 1700 and 1929 1132 publications on duodenal ulcer. The published US cases of proven peptic ulcer in the nineteenth century were further analysed; details of sex, year of proven diagnosis and year of birth were available for 184 (90 male) cases of gastric ulcer and 77 (63 male) cases of duodenal ulcer.

Results

There were exponential increases in the number of monographs and articles on both types of peptic ulcer in the nineteenth century, and the curves for the four countries are remarkably similar. The increases in publications on gastric ulcer began about 1800 and for duodenal ulcer decades later. The number of cases of gastric ulcer diagnosed definitively in the US rose slowly in the first half of the nineteenth century and then increased markedly, with the increases in proven duodenal ulcer 10–20 years later. The birth years of patients with gastric ulcer peaked for those born in the 1850s, and about 10–20 years later for patients with duodenal ulcer.

Conclusion

Such exponential increases are compatible with current models of infection with Helicobacter pylori but do not explain either the difference in timing between gastric and duodenal ulcer or the simultaneity between the four countries.

### Turn over the new leaf of the treatment in peptic ulcer bleeding: a review of the literature [^1a02f3de]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

A peptic ulcer is a mucosal break with a size over 5 mm that forms in the lining of the stomach or the duodenum. Many kinds of etiologies can result in peptic ulcer disease. Helicobacter pylori (Hp) infection and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are the two major causes of peptic ulcers. Other uncommon etiologies for peptic ulcers are named Hp-negative, NSAID-negative ulcers, including gastrinoma (Zollinger–Ellison syndrome), gastric malignancy (adenocarcinoma and lymphoma), Crohn disease, eosinophilic gastroenteritis, viral infections, Behcet disease, acute stress, and mucosal ischemia.

Gastric acid, bicarbonate, and digestive enzymes compose the gastric environment with a dynamic pH value between 1.5 and 3. In normal conditions, protective mechanisms of the stomach can protect and repair the gastric mucosa. When an imbalance between gastric acid and mucosal protection occurs, such as gastric acid hypersecretion and impaired duodenal bicarbonate secretion, it may result in peptic ulcer disease. Hp infection can disrupt the protective mucous layer, causing gastritis and impair the mucosa healing. Hp-induced antral inflammation can also increase basal and stimulated gastric acid secretion.NSAIDs inhibit mucosal prostaglandin synthesis, which can reduce the mucosa blood flow, the integrity of the mucosal barrier, and the amount of bicarbonate.

Common symptoms of peptic ulcers include epigastric pain, bloating, nausea, vomiting, and in severe cases, bleeding or perforation of the stomach or duodenum. The most common complication of peptic ulcers in emergency departments is bleeding, approximately 100–170 per 100,000 worldwide. Peptic ulcer bleeding is a serious medical condition causing hematemesis, melena (tarry stool), or hematochezia. Patients without timely treatment can progress into anemia, hypovolemic shock, multiorgan failure, or even death. The mortality rate of peptic ulcer bleeding is approximately 5%–12%. Therefore, clinicians have been dedicated to developing the most effective treatment for peptic ulcer bleeding for decades.

### The diffuse-type gastric cancer epidemiology enigma [^8c945fb3]. BMC Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Treatment of H. pylori infection is based on combined antibiotic therapy, associated with proton-pump inhibitors; the use of this class of drugs appears to impact the gastric microbiota. Several consequences of this treatment could be hypothesized: i) reduction of non- H. pylori bacteria sensitive to the antibiotics; ii) increased proliferation of bacteria resistant to treatment; iii) a replacement of the microbiota due to empty niches previously occupied by antibiotic-sensitive bacteria and, ultimately, iv) a dysbiotic stomach microbiota.

Preliminary data seem to demonstrate that in the presence of H. pylori infection, the diversity of other bacteria is lower than in its absence. The impact of these important alterations in GC, including the diffuse-type, is unknown. Although H. pylori infection appears to have a key role in gastric cancer, interactions with other bacteria may be part of the carcinogenic process, and the understanding of these interactions might shed light on the epidemiologic trends of the diffuse-type GAC.

Gastric H. pylori infection is recognized as the main cause of both gastric cancer and duodenal peptic ulcer. Although the etiologic agent is the same, peptic ulcer occurs in a very acid environment, and the antrum seems to be the most important site of infection. On the other hand, patients with duodenal peptic ulcer have a lower risk of GAC than that of the general population.

Interactions among different bacteria and H. pylori infection may influence certain molecular pathways (Fig. 2). According to hypothetical scenarios: i) H. pylori infection plus specific bacterial co-infection may favor gastric cancer pathway; ii) H. pylori infection plus other specific bacteria may favor the benign peptic disease pathway; iii) treatment of H. pylori infection may favor the proliferation of specific bacteria that may have a role in diffuse-type carcinogenesis, thus counteracting the H. pylori eradication and keeping elevated the rates of diffuse-type cancers related to stomach infection.

### Kyoto global consensus report on Helicobacter pylori gastritis [^3334b2fa]. Gut (2015). Low credibility.

Worldwide the most common cause of chronic gastritis is infection with H. pylori. H. pylori causes progressive damage to the gastric mucosa and is now accepted as playing a causative role in a number of important diseases, including duodenal ulcer disease, gastric ulcer disease, gastric adenocarcinoma and gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma. Indeed, H. pylori –induced gastritis is considered as the most important risk factor for peptic ulcer and its complications as well as for gastric cancer.

The current International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-10), issued in 1989 by the International Conference for the Tenth Revision of the ICD was endorsed by WHO at the 43rd general assembly in 1990 and has been used for disease statistics since 1994 among member countries of WHO. In the ICD-10, all the digestive diseases are classified under K code with different two-digit numbers. However, H. pylori was not integrated into gastritis classification in the gastritis section (K29) of ICD-10, even though H. pylori gastritis is the predominant type of gastritis and clinically by far the most relevant because of its predisposing role of severe gastroduodenal complications. Moreover, the current ICD-10 classification of gastritis is not organised according to aetiology but is merely a mixture of phenotype and aetiology and also includes duodenitis (box 1). Therefore, a revision of the gastritis and duodenitis classification based on all the possible aetiologies was proposed after the working group meeting for the ICD-11 revision held in Tokyo in 2010 and submitted as the ICD11 β foundation component. However, in the ICD11 β foundation classification (box 2), the original plan was changed. In an attempt to gather broader opinions on the rationale of the new classification system originally proposed to ICD-11, we devoted one section to this important issue at this meeting.

### Diagnosis and treatment of peptic ulcer disease [^9fcdb086]. The American Journal of Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Peptic ulcer disease continues to be a source of significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. Approximately two-thirds of patients found to have peptic ulcer disease are asymptomatic. In symptomatic patients, the most common presenting symptom of peptic ulcer disease is epigastric pain, which may be associated with dyspepsia, bloating, abdominal fullness, nausea, or early satiety. Most cases of peptic ulcer disease are associated with Helicobacter pylori infection or the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), or both. In this review, we discuss the role of proton pump inhibitors in the management of peptic ulcer disease, highlight the latest guidelines about the diagnosis and management of H. pylori, and discuss the latest evidence in the management of complications related to peptic ulcer disease, including endoscopic intervention for peptic ulcer-related bleeding. Timely diagnosis and treatment of peptic ulcer disease and its sequelae are crucial in order to minimize associated morbidity and mortality, as is prevention of peptic ulcer disease among patients at high risk, including those infected with H. pylori and users of NSAIDs.

Gastric perforation is a core emergency disease treated by the general surgeon. The majority are caused by peptic ulcer disease and neoplasms; however, other etiologies, such as iatrogenic injury and gastric ischemia, are prevalent enough to merit separate attention. While the authors can extrapolate from our knowledge of the treatment of ulcer and neoplastic perforations when treating the lesser known causes, there are nuanced differences in how they approach it. The recognition and treatment of non-ulcer, nonneoplasm gastric perforation will be the focus of this article.

### Effects of gastroprotectant drugs for the prevention and treatment of peptic ulcer disease and its complications: a meta-analysis of randomised trials [^f70f1d96]. The Lancet: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2018). Medium credibility.

Figure 2
Prevention trials: effects of gastroprotectants on endoscopic and symptomatic ulcers

For 97 trials for the endoscopic outcome and 36 trials for the symptomatic outcome, in which the total number of ulcers was not reported but the breakdown was, we assumed that the total number of ulcers was equal to gastric plus duodenal: 1256 of 7414 events vs 2277 of 5766 events for endoscopic ulcers and 469 of 2492 events vs 927 of 2021 events for symptomatic ulcers. PPI = proton-pump inhibitor. H2RA = histamine-2 receptor antagonist. *Summary odds ratios, indicated by diamonds, are presented with 95% CIs; all other odds ratios are presented with 99% CIs.

Few data were available with which to assess the relative efficacy of drugs within each gastroprotectant class, but the available trials provided no evidence that any individual PPI or prostaglandin analogue was more effective for the prevention of endoscopic ulcer than any other in the same class and we found little evidence of heterogeneity in treatment effects among H2RAs (p het = 0·0286; appendix p 4).

Overall, compared with control, allocation to a gastroprotectant drug resulted in a substantial reduction in the odds of a symptomatic ulcer (OR 0·25 [95% CI 0·22–0·29]; absolute benefit 67 [59–75] events avoided per 1000 allocated treatment; p < 0·0001; figure 2). However, because there were only about a third as many symptomatic ulcers as endoscopic ulcers available for analysis, the relative effectiveness of individual gastroprotectant classes on symptomatic ulcers was less clear. Overall, PPIs were more effective than were H2RAs and prostaglandin analogues (between the three classes p het = 0·0018), but data were insufficient to provide separate estimates of effectiveness for duodenal and gastric ulcers (figure 2). We found no clear evidence that any individual PPI or prostaglandin analogue was more effective for the prevention of symptomatic ulcer than any other of the same class (appendix p 5), and only weak evidence of heterogeneity in treatment effects among H2RAs (p het = 0·0447; appendix p 5).

### Peptic ulcer disease [^19992bb4]. Lancet (2017). Excellent credibility.

The rapidly declining prevalence of Helicobacter pylori infection and widespread use of potent anti-secretory drugs means peptic ulcer disease has become substantially less prevalent than it was two decades ago. Management has, however, become more challenging than ever because of the threat of increasing antimicrobial resistance worldwide and widespread use of complex anti-thrombotic therapy in the ageing population. Peptic ulcers not associated with H pylori infection or the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are now also imposing substantial diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. This Seminar aims to provide a balanced overview of the latest advances in the pathogenetic mechanisms of peptic ulcers, guidelines on therapies targeting H pylori infection, approaches to treatment of peptic ulcer complications associated with anti-inflammatory analgesics and anti-thrombotic agents, and the unmet needs in terms of our knowledge and management of this increasingly challenging condition.

### Evidence-based medicine as it applies to acid suppression in the hospitalized patient [^1ec746e5]. Critical Care Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

An evidence-based-medicine approach may be applied to studies in the medical literature to help physicians make sound judgments about efficacy and safety data and to improve clinical decision making. To assess the role of gastric acid suppression in the prevention of stress ulcer bleeding and in the management of upper gastrointestinal bleeding after successful hemostasis of bleeding peptic ulcer disease, the following questions should be addressed: Is it possible to identify risk factors for clinically important bleeding in critically ill patients? Can intravenous acid suppression prevent stress ulcer-related bleeding or prevent rebleeding in peptic ulcers after successful hemostasis? What is the most effective method of acid suppression for these disorders? An evidence-based-medicine review of published trials yields sufficient evidence to support the use of prophylactic acid suppression in critically ill patients with coagulopathy or in those who are receiving prolonged mechanical ventilation. Not enough data have accumulated to prove the superiority of intravenous proton pump inhibitors to intravenous histamine-2-receptor antagonists for prophylaxis of clinically important stress ulcer bleeding. With respect to acute gastrointestinal bleeding, however, two well-conducted trials indicate that an intravenous proton pump inhibitor is significantly more effective than an intravenous histamine-2-receptor antagonist or placebo in reducing the rate of rebleeding after hemostasis in patients with bleeding peptic ulcer. Analysis of the data from both trials shows that only five to six patients would need to receive an intravenous proton pump inhibitor to avoid one episode of rebleeding.

### Surgical management of ulcer disease [^66d78a98]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

Surgical management of patients who have acid peptic ulcers requires a firm understanding of the technical options and an even firmer grasp of the anatomic, physiologic, and pathophysiologic relationships of the organs involved. This is a constellation of problems in which the surgeon needs to be far more than a technician. The wealth of information discovered on this subject, from the clinical observations of William Beaumont to the discovery of complex cellular biology and hormonal signaling, is enough to occupy the study of several careers. Although patients who have acid peptic disorders have largely become the primary responsibility of physicians and specialists other than surgeons, when significant complications occur in these patients, it is the surgeon who is called upon to intervene.

### Kyoto global consensus report on Helicobacter pylori gastritis [^105fc054]. Gut (2015). Low credibility.

Comment

The updated Sydney System has been globally implemented into clinical practice and requires proper assessment of all the relevant characteristics of H. pylori gastritis including atrophy and intestinal metaplasia at different gastric subsites. Categorising gastritis is clinically relevant because the 'phenotype' of H. pylori gastritis determines the risk of progression to gastroduodenal complications.

Severity and extent of atrophic gastritis and intestinal metaplasia are well established as indicators of the increased risk for developing gastric cancer. Similarly, severe H. pylori -induced corpus gastritis is associated with an increased risk for gastric cancer. New staging systems for the characterisation of gastritis have been introduced to assess the gastric cancer risk. They are used in clinical practice and are either based on the severity of atrophy in various gastric subsites (OLGA)or on intestinal metaplasia (OLGIM). Both systems, discussed further in section 3, are reported to have a positive impact on patient management.

Gastric erosions should be reported separately from gastritis. The natural history and clinical significance of gastroduodenal erosions depend on aetiology and need further clarification.

Literature searches, evidence synthesis and grading of evidence

A literature search was undertaken by each subgroup with predefined search terms, electronic databases used (PubMed, Embase, Cochrane and Medline) and the time period covered. Where appropriate, conference abstracts were used to help formulate recommendations, provided that these were of sufficient scientific rigour.

The PICOs were used to guide the search for evidence and the highest quality studies were prioritised. Systematic reviews or meta-analyses were selected initially. Where systematic reviews, meta-analyses or critically appraised articles were unavailable, lower levels of evidence were selected. Where reviews use poor-quality studies such as that by Spence et al, for example, where the review was based on small, often single-centre cohort studies resulting in high levels of heterogenicity, this is discussed in the evidence review and highlighted in the evidence tables. In this instance, more weight is given to larger studies using large databases, which are likely to be more accurate. This hierarchy of searching was performed in a pyramidal sequence from top (high quality) to bottom (low quality), cascading from recently published systematic reviews of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or observational studies, to RCTs, and subsequently to observational studies providing that no evidence is available from the higher quality categories. The selected evidence was tabulated in an evidence table categorising each study into the study design, intervention/clinical question, participants/population, reference standard, results and conclusions/comments.

Although randomised controlled studies are deemed the most appropriate type of study to assess the effectiveness of an intervention, other types of studies were included to assess types of effectiveness, such as ways of delivering service or outcomes from registries in clinical practice. If evidence from studies was weak or contradictory, searches for alternative sources were undertaken to see if the evidence concurred or contradicted (triangulation of searches). All available negative studies were included in the searches. The subgroups discussed the external validity of the studies and whether the study outcomes are applicable to the target population for the guidelines. Literature searches were transparent and reproducible to reduce 'dissemination biases'.

All evidence tables and references were downloaded to a shared reference manager (F1000Workspace), to which all GDG members had access. Shortly before the statements were finalised, a further literature search was undertaken. The quality of the evidence was assessed following the GRADE terminology using table 2. Evidence is graded as high, moderate, low and very low quality (table 2).

### Implications of the paradigm shift in management ofinfections [^46765871]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Helicobacter pylori infections are etiologically related to peptic ulcer, atrophic gastritis, and gastric cancer. Since H. pylori's discovery in the 1980's, antimicrobial therapy for H. pylori infections has primarily been empiric with potentially effective therapies being identified by trial and error; cure rates were generally low(Figures 1 and 2). It soon became apparent that finding an ideal therapy was going to be difficult as resistance to the commonly used antibiotics developed rapidly and exerted a detrimental effect on cure rates. Antibiotic regimens approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) also often had relatively low cure rates as the focus was on healing of peptic ulcers rather than on cure of the infection. Although H. pylori was declared a carcinogen by the World Health Organization in 1994the clinical focus remained on peptic ulcer which, at that time, was a major health problem and, in the United States, gastric cancer was becoming increasingly rare. The concept that cure of the infection would also prevent development of atrophic gastritis, which had long been recognized a precursor lesion for gastric cancer, was not immediately recognized.

Surgery plays an important role in the treatment of life-threatening complications of PUD, such as bleeding, perforation, and gastric outlet obstruction, as well as for disease that is refractory to medical management. The article highlights the critical role of surgery in cases where medical therapy is insufficient or in the event of emergency complications arising from PUD.

### Peptic-ulcer disease [^e0d7bb79]. Lancet (2002). Excellent credibility.

The discovery of Helicobacter pylori has greatly changed our approach to peptic ulcer disease. Bacterial, host, and environmental factors all have a role in peptic-ulcer disease. Although the prevalence of uncomplicated peptic ulcers is falling, hospital admissions for ulcer complications associated with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are rising. Evidence suggests that prescription of NSAIDs along with potent antiulcer agents and the use of highly selective cyclo-oxygenase-2 inhibitors reduce gastroduodenal ulceration. Whether these therapeutic advances will translate into clinical benefits remains to be seen. The interaction between H pylori and NSAIDs is one of the most controversial issues in peptic ulcer disease. With the fall in rates of H pylori infection, the proportion of ulcers not related to this organism and NSAIDs has risen, which will affect the management of peptic ulcer.

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are probably the most common cause of gastroduodenal injury in the United States today. Approximately half of patients who regularly take NSAIDs have gastric erosions, and 15%-30% have ulcers when they are examined endoscopically. However, the incidence of clinical gastrointestinal (GI) events caused by NSAIDs is much lower. Clinical upper GI events may occur in 3%-4.5% of patients taking NSAIDs, and serious complicated events develop in approximately 1.5%. However, the risk varies widely in relationship to clinical features such as history of ulcers or GI events, age, concomitant anticoagulant or steroid use, and NSAID dose. This review discusses the risks of clinical GI disease in NSAID users, the predictors of increased risk, and strategies for prevention of NSAID-associated GI disease.

The management of Helicobacter pylori infection is still surrounded by controversy and uncertainties. Indications and correct application of current regimens for Helicobacter pylori infection are still considered a matter of debate. Regarding indications, only peptic ulcer and mucosa associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma are considered clear indications for treatment. In other conditions, such as atrophic gastritis, post gastric cancer resection, first-degree relatives of gastric cancer patients, dyspeptic patients, patients with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug users, the value of Helicobacter pylori eradication is still controversial. The regimens for first-line and second-line treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection have been recommended by the Maastricht 2 Consensus Report. Although all the treatments are considered to be effective, physicians still do not agree on what first-line regimen should be used. Furthermore, a consensus on the duration of the antibiotic treatment is still lacking, although Maastricht guidelines for treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection recommend a one-week therapy. Also regimens, as a third-line treatment, and methods to improve compliance and clinical outcome are still a matter of debate. All these points will be considered in the present review

Comment

Although the ICD-10 has been updated regularly to accommodate new diseases and concepts, WHO recognised the necessity of overall systematic changes in the ICD and decided to revise the current ICD-10 to ICD-11 in 2007. As the intermediate process for this revision, the ICD11 β version was formulated with input from various scientific advisory groups. This version was open to the public so that opinions from various interest groups and a broader range of medical specialists could be reflected before compiling the ICD-11. ICD11 β foundation component consists of the core of the ICD-11 classification from which mortality and morbidity classifications will derive. However, it remains a draft and can be changed from time to time before finalisation of ICD-11 (for more details, please visit).

In the ICD11 β foundation component of the gastritis section, classification of gastritis was principally based on aetiological factors with consideration of their specific pathophysiological principles (box 2). Accordingly, H. pylori gastritis is categorised as a specific nosological entity.

The assessment of gastritis based on histopathological criteria was completely changed after recognition of H. pylori as the most common cause of chronic gastritis. The Sydney System was developed as a consequence and has been integrated into clinical practice. The Sydney classification of gastritis combined histological parameters of activity, chronicity, atrophy, intestinal metaplasia, topographical distribution and aetiopathogenic information for reporting the pathology of gastritis in endoscopic biopsies.

As described above, classification of gastritis in the foundation component of ICD11 β version is principally based on causative factors, in order to cover the three most important and best defined categories of gastritis — namely, (a) H. pylori -induced, (b) drug-induced and (c) autoimmune gastritis. A specific diagnosis among these different categories of gastritis is required to direct specific management and treatment strategies. The diagnosis of H. pylori -induced gastritis has major implications for life-long healthcare. H. pylori gastritis may cause dyspeptic symptomsand result in gastroduodenal pathologies, including peptic ulcer disease (PUD) and gastric cancer. The recognised role of H. pylori as a carcinogen makes eradication of H. pylori infection the preferred strategy for the prevention of gastric cancer. There is more to learn about aetiologies other than H. pylori in gastritis and this is dealt with as ' H. pylori -negative or idiopathic gastritis'.

Importance

In the US, peptic ulcer disease affects 1% of the population and approximately 54 000 patients are admitted to the hospital annually for bleeding peptic ulcers.

Observations

Approximately 10% of patients presenting with upper abdominal pain in a primary care setting have a peptic ulcer as the cause of their symptoms. The principal causes of peptic ulcer disease are Helicobacter pylori infection, which affects approximately 42% of patients with peptic ulcer disease, and aspirin or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use, which are etiologic factors in approximately 36% of people with peptic ulcer disease. Complications of peptic ulcer include bleeding (73% of patients), perforation (9% of patients), and pyloric obstruction (3% of patients). Annually, 10 000 people die of peptic ulcer disease in the US. Endoscopy definitively diagnoses peptic ulcer disease. Acid blockers, such as omeprazole, can heal peptic ulcers in approximately 80% to 100% of patients within 4 weeks, but gastric ulcers larger than 2 cm may require 8 weeks of treatment. Eradication of H pylori decreases peptic ulcer recurrence rates from approximately 50% to 60% to 0% to 2%. Discontinuing NSAIDs heals 95% of ulcers identified on endoscopy and reduces recurrence from 40% to 9%. When discontinuing an NSAID is not desirable, changing the NSAID (eg, from ketorolac to ibuprofen), adding a proton pump inhibitor such as omeprazole or lansoprazole, and eradicating H pylori with treatment such as bismuth, metronidazole, and tetracycline combined with omeprazole can reduce recurrence rates.

Conclusions and Relevance

Peptic ulcer disease is associated with increased hospitalization rates and mortality. Acid blocking with proton pump inhibitors, such as omeprazole or lansoprazole, is the primary treatment. Recurrence of ulcers can be prevented by eradicating H pylori if present and discontinuing aspirin or NSAIDs if applicable.

### Perforated and bleeding peptic ulcer: WSES guidelines [^3874c7f4]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

We suggest utlizing different types of hemodynamic monitoring (invasive or not) to optimize fluids/vasopressor therapy and to individualize the resuscitation strategy (strong recommendation based on low quality evidences, 1C).

Unstable septic perforated peptic ulcer patients need appropriate and rapid (ideally within 1 h) resuscitation to reduce mortality; this must take place simultaneously with surgical consultation, microbiological cultures (blood and other), and antibiotic administration. Primarily, as in any emergency situation, a rapid ABC (airway, breathing, and circulation) evaluation should be done. Secondarily, appropriate targets for resuscitation (the same used for sepsis and septic shock) need to be considered. In general, the most important are:
Mean arterial pressure (MAP) ≥ 65 mmHg
Urine output ≥ 0.5 ml/kg/h
Lactate normalization

Several forms of hemodynamic monitoring (invasive or not) are available to optimize resuscitation and fluid/vasopressors administration. For a more comprehensive approach to sepsis and septic shock, we suggest referring to the last published guidelines of the "Surviving Sepsis Campaign".

Notes on the use of the guidelines: aims, targets, and limitations

The Guidelines are aimed to present the state-of-the-art regarding diagnosis and therapeutic options for an optimal management of complicated peptic ulcer. These guidelines are thus intended to improve the knowledge and the awareness of physicians around the world on the specific topic of complicated peptic ulcer, providing an up-to-date tool that can help during the decision-making process. For this reason, the Guidelines are evidence-based and the grade of recommendation is provided to summarize the evidences present in literature. The population considered in these guidelines is adult patients with suspected complicated peptic ulcer disease. The practice Guidelines promulgated in this work do not represent a standard of practice. They are suggested plans of care, based on best available evidence and the consensus of experts but they do not exclude other approaches as being within the standard of practice. For example, they should not be used to compel adherence to a given method of medical management, which method should be finally determined after taking account of the conditions at the relevant medical institution (staff levels, experience, equipment, etc.) and the characteristics of the individual patient. However, responsibility for the results of treatment rests with those who are directly engaged therein, and not with the consensus group.
