## Question

How do MN and MPGN differ on the ABIM exam?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how membranous nephropathy (MN) and membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN) differ on the ABIM exam. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the key clinical-pathologic distinctions and modern classifications for MN and MPGN. Then, I should verify how KDIGO guidelines shape diagnostic and therapeutic decision-making that ABIM is likely to test. Next, I will review ABIM exam design principles to anticipate question styles and relative frequency. Finally, I will synthesize classic vignette patterns, common pitfalls, and high-yield takeaways for each entity, ensuring the reasoning aligns with contemporary evidence and exam blueprints.

> Let me first confirm the modern view of MN. MN is an autoimmune podocytopathy defined by subepithelial immune complex deposition driven by autoantibodies to specific target antigens (most commonly PLA2R, also THSD7A), and the field has moved toward an antigen-based classification that identifies at least 14 target antigens accounting for the majority of cases, which ABIM is likely to emphasize over the older primary/secondary dichotomy [^113E54sf] [^1143igxs].

> Wait, let me verify the diagnostic approach that ABIM often tests for MN. KDIGO allows a nonbiopsy diagnosis of MN when a patient presents with nephrotic syndrome and a positive anti-PLA2R serology, which is a classic testable exception to the "biopsy most glomerulopathies" rule, and ABIM frequently probes this nuance; MN is also a leading cause of adult nephrotic syndrome, increasing its exam salience [^113tA1sb] [^1152Fm9c].

> Next, I should review management in MN through a risk-stratified lens, because ABIM tends to present "next-best step" scenarios. KDIGO 2021 recommends tailoring therapy to risk: observation for low risk; rituximab or calcineurin inhibitor-based regimens for moderate/high risk; and cyclophosphamide with corticosteroids for very high risk, with supportive care for all and PLA2R antibody–guided adjustments and surveillance after 6 months of therapy, which the exam may test explicitly with antibody kinetics and regimen modifications; decisions about prophylactic anticoagulation in severe nephrosis are also tested [^111rSoUE] [^114Q5HY1] [^1127uLxk] [^115KpA3b] [^111RoC86] [^116vSvaZ] [^112GYEDG].

> Now, let me consider MPGN carefully. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — MPGN is no longer a single disease but a pattern of injury characterized by mesangial hypercellularity and capillary wall duplication; the modern reclassification is immunofluorescence-based into immune complex–mediated MPGN versus complement-mediated disease (C3 glomerulopathy), and the old EM types I/II/III are obsolete on exams, which ABIM expects examinees to recognize [^11121LqD] [^1147Vguy] [^113k9FBs].

> I should confirm the diagnostic framework ABIM is likely to test for MPGN. Unlike MN, MPGN generally requires a kidney biopsy, followed by a systematic evaluation for secondary causes in immune complex–mediated disease (chronic infections such as HCV/HBV and endocarditis, autoimmune disorders, and monoclonal gammopathy), and targeted complement and genetic assessment when no etiology is found or when C3-dominant staining suggests alternative pathway dysregulation; infection-related GN must be excluded before labeling C3 glomerulopathy, and monoclonal immunoglobulin disease should prompt a hematologic workup [^116EBLbm] [^111dbE4p] [^113Vjjqu] [^115DsqmD].

> I will now examine therapeutic principles ABIM tends to probe in MPGN. The mainstay is supportive care and treatment of the underlying process in immune complex–mediated disease; immunosuppression is reserved for specific contexts such as indolent idiopathic cases with nephrotic syndrome and preserved function or rapidly progressive crescentic disease, while C3 glomerulopathy often tests as mycophenolate plus corticosteroids first line (in the absence of monoclonal gammopathy) with eculizumab as a consideration if refractory, and participation in clinical trials is encouraged; supportive care alone is advised in many with advanced kidney dysfunction or low-grade proteinuria [^1173k4yv] [^111fTXMo] [^116UPBtB] [^116BKTeh] [^116MDVHe] [^1159fdV8] [^114ibdsc].

> Let me integrate ABIM test design principles to gauge emphasis and frequency. The blueprint weights content by importance and frequency in practice, and the cognitive level prioritizes synthesis and judgment over recall, so common, guideline-driven entities like MN appear more often than rare patterns like MPGN; nephrology in-training performance correlates strongly with ABIM outcomes, underscoring the value of mastering these high-yield frameworks [^112gkdTJ] [^113jga51] [^116HKzps].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I should also consider epidemiology to support frequency on the exam. MN is a common cause of adult nephrotic syndrome, whereas MPGN is rare in contemporary practice, with an estimated European prevalence of approximately 16 per 100,000, which helps explain why ABIM more often tests MN management algorithms and uses MPGN to assess diagnostic reasoning and classification accuracy [^1152Fm9c] [^115iYhn5].

> Let me walk through a classic MN vignette and the exam logic. A middle-aged adult with edema, nephrotic-range proteinuria, preserved eGFR, and positive anti-PLA2R presents; I initially think "biopsy confirms MN", but wait, I should double-check — KDIGO states a biopsy is not required if nephrotic syndrome coexists with positive anti-PLA2R, so ABIM may expect anti-PLA2R–based diagnosis and risk-stratified initial therapy or observation; they also like antibody-guided adjustments at 6 months and decisions about prophylactic anticoagulation in severe nephrosis, alongside supportive measures such as RAAS blockade [^113tA1sb] [^111rSoUE] [^111RoC86] [^116vSvaZ] [^112GYEDG] [^1127uLxk].

> Now a prototypical MPGN/C3G vignette and the reasoning steps. A patient with hematuria, proteinuria, low C3, and biopsy showing an MPGN pattern with C3-dominant deposits prompts classification as C3 glomerulopathy; hold on, I should verify the next step — exclude infection-related GN first, then evaluate for complement dysregulation and monoclonal gammopathy; therapy often starts with mycophenolate plus corticosteroids in moderate-to-severe disease without monoclonal drivers, consider eculizumab if refractory, reserve cyclophosphamide with high-dose steroids for rapidly progressive crescentic presentations, and provide supportive care alone in advanced CKD; ABIM may also ask for etiology-first management in immune complex–mediated MPGN (for example, treating HCV) and awareness that clinical trial participation is recommended in refractory cases [^113Vjjqu] [^116EBLbm] [^116BKTeh] [^111fTXMo] [^116UPBtB] [^114ibdsc] [^116MDVHe].

> But wait, what if the stem tries to trick me with outdated terminology or "masked" deposits. I need to ensure I reject the obsolete type I/II/III MPGN scheme and instead use IF-based classification, and I should remember that monoclonal or "masked" immunoglobulin deposits can mimic C3G on frozen IF, requiring paraffin IF to unmask true monoclonal deposits linked to an MGRS process; ABIM may test recognition of these pitfalls and the importance of standardized pathology terminology and differentials such as thrombotic microangiopathy and fibrillary GN when evaluating an MPGN pattern [^11121LqD] [^1119vBMF] [^1128VPJ7] [^113w823F].

> Hold on, I should verify one potential misconception about MPGN therapy. I almost said "steroids are standard for MPGN", but I need to correct that — guidelines prioritize treating the underlying cause and supportive care, consider limited corticosteroid courses only in specific idiopathic immune complex–mediated presentations, and reserve aggressive immunosuppression for crescentic disease or carefully selected cases, with advanced CKD often managed conservatively, which ABIM may probe to differentiate evidence-based care from reflexive immunosuppression [^1173k4yv] [^1147THAi] [^116UPBtB] [^114ibdsc].

> In summary, I should anchor the ABIM distinctions this way: MN is tested as a common, biomarker-driven autoimmune nephrotic syndrome with antigen-based classification, PLA2R-enabled diagnostic shortcuts, and clear risk-stratified treatment algorithms that hinge on KDIGO recommendations and antibody kinetics, whereas MPGN is tested as a rare biopsy pattern demanding IF-based reclassification, etiologic workups for infection/autoimmunity/monoclonal gammopathy, complement pathway evaluation, and conservative or etiology-directed therapy with selective use of immunosuppression and clinical trials; ABIM's emphasis on prevalence and clinical judgment means MN appears more frequently in "next step in management" items, while MPGN often appears in classification and diagnostic framework questions [^111rSoUE] [^113tA1sb] [^112gkdTJ] [^11121LqD] [^116EBLbm].

Key ABIM point: MN has subepithelial immune complex deposits with a "spike and dome" pattern [^113E54sf] [^113hWsYd] and **normal complement**, whereas MPGN shows mesangial/endocapillary proliferation with **double-contour GBM** [^11121LqD], subendothelial or intramembranous deposits, and **low C3** [^114xjdCn] [^11121LqD]. MN typically presents with nephrotic syndrome and is managed with risk-based immunosuppression (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, or CNIs) [^111rSoUE] [^114Q5HY1], whereas MPGN often presents with mixed nephritic–nephrotic features [^113k9FBs] and is treated by addressing the underlying cause [^1173k4yv], providing supportive care [^111fTXMo], and adding immunosuppression if needed [^116UPBtB].

| Prognosis | Variable; spontaneous remission is common [^1152rD9E] | Progressive; risk of ESRD [^113k9FBs] |

MN and MPGN differ in **pathogenesis, histology, complement, and management**: MN is subepithelial with normal complement [^113E54sf], whereas MPGN is mesangial/endocapillary with low C3 [^11121LqD].

### Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis pattern of injury [^114ce8tj]. Advances in Kidney Disease and Health (2024). Low credibility.

Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN) is no longer a disease but rather a pattern of injury observed in various diseases. Characterized by electron-dense deposits, mesangial proliferation, and duplication of the glomerular basement membrane, MPGN was previously classified based on findings detected through electron microscopy. However, the recognition of complement dysfunction in relation to cases with the MPGN pattern of injury has substantially changed our understanding of its pathogenesis. A new classification, which includes immune complex-mediated and complement-mediated MPGN, has become preferable and adopted by international guidelines.

Despite these advancements, accurately diagnosing MPGN remains a clinical challenge. This is due to the pathological and clinical similarities between immune complex-mediated and complement-mediated MPGN. Additional testing, such as molecular and genetic testing, is often necessary for proper diagnosis. Here, we summarize our understanding of the MPGN pattern of injury from a pathology perspective, serving as an introductory article for the following chapters.

### Histopathology of MPGN and C3 glomerulopathies [^11121LqD]. Nature Reviews Nephrology (2015). Low credibility.

'Membranoproliferative' describes glomerular injury characterized by capillary wall thickening and mesangial expansion due to increased matrix deposition and hypercellularity. The presence of immune deposits indicates membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN). Historically, MPGN was classified into three types based on the appearance and site of electron-dense deposits seen by electron microscopy. However, it is now recognized that many cases show only deposition of the complement component C3 due to abnormal control of the alternative pathway of complement activation. These cases are now classified as C3 glomerulopathies.

Not all cases of C3 glomerulopathy exhibit an MPGN pattern. C3 glomerulopathies include dense deposit disease, which shows dense osmiophilic deposits, and C3 glomerulonephritis, which shows isolated deposits. In many cases, the genetic mutations or autoantibodies responsible for C3 deposition have been identified. Some patients with abnormal complement control will accumulate small amounts of immunoglobulin in their glomeruli. Thus, the morphological diagnosis of 'glomerulonephritis with dominant C3' is useful for identifying patients who require investigation of the complement pathway. The recognition that many cases of MPGN are C3 glomerulopathies, and that the underlying cause can often be identified in immunoglobulin-associated cases, means that the diagnosis of idiopathic MPGN is now very uncommon.

### Mayo Clinic consensus report on membranous nephropathy: Proposal for a novel classification [^113E54sf]. Kidney International (2023). High credibility.

Membranous nephropathy (MN) is a pattern of injury caused by autoantibodies binding to specific target antigens, with accumulation of immune complexes along the subepithelial region of glomerular basement membranes. The past 20 years have brought revolutionary advances in the understanding of MN, particularly through the discovery of novel target antigens and their respective autoantibodies. These discoveries have challenged the traditional classification of MN into primary and secondary forms. At least 14 target antigens have been identified, accounting for 80%-90% of cases of MN. Many of the forms of MN associated with these novel MN target antigens have distinctive clinical and pathologic phenotypes.

The Mayo Clinic consensus report on MN proposes a two-step classification of MN. The first step, when possible, is the identification of the target antigen, based on a multistep algorithm and using a combination of serology, staining of the kidney biopsy tissue by immunofluorescence or immunohistochemistry, and/or mass spectrometry methodology. The second step is the search for a potential underlying disease or associated condition, which is particularly relevant when knowledge of the target antigen is available to direct it.

The meeting acknowledges that the resources and equipment required to perform the proposed testing may not be generally available. However, the meeting consensus was that the time has come to adopt an antigen-based classification of MN because this approach will allow for accurate and specific MN diagnosis, with significant implications for patient management.

### Glomerular diseases: Membranous nephropathy — a modern view [^1143igxs]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2014). Low credibility.

Membranous nephropathy (MN) is an autoimmune disease usually associated with a nephrotic syndrome, which may progress to ESRD in the long term. Its etiology is often unknown (idiopathic MN), whereas other cases have a recognizable etiology (secondary MN). In idiopathic MN, the glomerular lesions are mainly caused by autoantibodies against a podocyte membrane protein, the M-type of phospholipase A2 receptor 1.

The natural course of idiopathic MN is quite varied, with spontaneous complete or partial remissions being relatively common. Patients with asymptomatic non-nephrotic proteinuria seldom progress and need only conservative management. However, those with persistent full-blown nephrotic syndrome and those with declining renal function are candidates for specific treatment with any of several regimens.

- **Treatment options**: Cyclical therapy with alternating monthly intravenous and oral glucocorticoids combined with a cytotoxic agent can induce remission and preserve renal function in the long term. Cyclosporine or tacrolimus can also induce remission, but relapses are frequent after drug withdrawal. Mycophenolate mofetil monotherapy seems to be ineffective but may be beneficial when administered together with steroids.

- **Other therapies**: The experience with adrenocorticotropic hormone, natural or synthetic, is limited to a few studies with short-term follow-up. However, high rates of remission can be seen after prolonged treatment. A high rate of remission and good tolerance have also been reported with rituximab.

Patients with moderate renal insufficiency may benefit from treatment, albeit with frequent and significant side effects.

### The American Board of Internal Medicine maintenance of certification examination and state medical board disciplinary actions: A population cohort study [^113QTH2a]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Some have questioned whether successful performance in the American Board of Internal Medicine (ABIM) Maintenance of Certification (MOC) program is meaningful. The association of the ABIM Internal Medicine (IM) MOC examination with state medical board disciplinary actions is unknown.

- **Objective**: To assess the risk of disciplinary actions among general internists who did and did not pass the MOC examination within 10 years of initial certification.

- **Design**: Historical population cohort study.

- **Participants**: The population of internists certified in internal medicine, but not a subspecialty, from 1990 through 2003 (n = 47,971).

- **Intervention**: ABIM IM MOC examination.

- **Setting**: General internal medicine in the United States.

- **Main measures**: The primary outcome measure was the time to disciplinary action assessed in association with whether the physician passed the ABIM IM MOC examination within 10 years of initial certification, adjusted for training, certification, demographic, and regulatory variables including state medical board Continuing Medical Education (CME) requirements.

- **Key results**: The risk for discipline among physicians who did not pass the IM MOC examination within the 10-year requirement window was more than double that of those who did pass the examination (adjusted HR 2.09; 95% CI, 1.83 to 2.39). Disciplinary actions did not vary by state CME requirements (adjusted HR 1.02; 95% CI, 0.94 to 1.16), but declined with increasing MOC examination scores (Kendall's tau-b coefficient = -0.98 for trend, p < 0.001). Among disciplined physicians, actions were less severe.

### Renal pathology in idiopathic membranous nephropathy: A new perspective [^114tzfZm]. Kidney International (2006). Low credibility.

Histology findings in idiopathic membranous nephropathy (MGN) have been associated with the risk of renal failure, though their independence from clinical variables at the time of biopsy, ability to predict progression rate, or role in guiding therapy remains uncertain. Renal biopsies from 389 adult MGN patients were evaluated semiquantitatively for interstitial fibrosis, tubular atrophy, vascular sclerosis, focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis lesions (FSGS), complement deposition, as well as the stage and synchrony of deposits via electron microscopy (EM). Associations were tested between these findings and the rate of renal function decline (slope), renal survival, remission in proteinuria, and response to immunosuppression.

Patients with a greater degree of tubulo-interstitial disease, vascular sclerosis, and secondary FSGS tended to be older, with higher mean arterial pressure and lower creatinine clearance at presentation. Despite these histologic features being linked to reduced renal survival, they did not independently predict this outcome apart from baseline clinical variables nor did they correlate with the decline rate in function or baseline proteinuria. Additionally, the severity of tubulo-interstitial and vascular lesions did not preclude remission in proteinuria in patients who received immunosuppressive therapy. Neither the stage nor synchronicity of EM deposits, nor the amount of complement deposition, predicted renal survival, though the latter did correlate with progression rate. In MGN, certain histologic changes are associated with renal survival outcome; however, these indicators alone did not determine independent predictions separate from clinical variables.

### Practical management of C3 glomerulopathy and Ig-mediated MPGN: Facts and uncertainties [^117VdoFw]. Kidney International (2020). Low credibility.

In recent years, a substantial body of experimental and clinical work has been devoted to C3 glomerulopathy and Ig-mediated membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis. Despite the rapid accumulation of data, several uncertainties about these two rare forms of nephropathies persist. These uncertainties concern their pathophysiology, classification, clinical course, relevance of biomarkers and pathology findings, and the assessment of the efficacy of the available therapies. The present review discusses the impact of these uncertainties on the clinical management of patients.

### Differential diagnosis of glomerular disease: A systematic and inclusive approach [^113VyNbU]. American Journal of Nephrology (2013). Low credibility.

Glomerular disease is a complex and evolving topic. In evaluating a specific case, it is not unusual for the clinician to ask: 'Am I missing something? Should I biopsy? When? Should I treat first, then biopsy?' This work, which is both evidence- and experience-based, is intended to address each of these concerns and many other issues relevant to the differential diagnosis of glomerular disease.

- **Summary**: The central approach is the use of diagnostic algorithms based on quantitative measures routinely obtained early in the course of the diagnostic evaluation. The algorithms are designed to be easy to navigate, systematic, and inclusive. Also provided is a detailed and prioritized list of recommended diagnostic testing and the rationale for each test.

- **Key message**: This work is intended to facilitate accurate diagnosis in individual patients presenting with evidence of glomerular disease.

### Performance on the American Board of Family Medicine (ABFM) certification examination: Are superior test-taking skills alone sufficient to pass [^113KewUb]? Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Certification examinations used by American specialty boards have been the sine qua non for demonstrating the knowledge sufficient for attainment of board certification in the United States for more than 75 years. Some people contend that the examination is predominantly a test of superior test-taking skills rather than of family medicine decision-making ability. In an effort to explore the validity of this assertion, we administered the American Board of Family Medicine (ABFM) Certification to examinees who had demonstrated proficiency in taking standardized tests but had limited medical knowledge.

- **Methods**: Four nonphysician experts in the field of measurement and testing were administered one version of the 2009 ABFM certification examination. Scaled scores were calculated for each examinee, and psychometric analyses were performed on the examinees' responses to examination items and compared with the performance of physicians who took the same examination.

- **Results**: The minimum passing threshold for the examination was a scaled score of 390, corresponding to 57.7% to 61.0% of questions answered correctly, depending on the version of the examination. The four nonphysician examinees performed poorly, with scaled scores that ranged from 20 to 160 (mean, 87.5; SD, 57.4). The number of questions answered correctly ranged from 24.0% to 35.1% (mean, 29.2%; SD, 0.05%). Rasch analyses of the examination items revealed that the nonphysician examinees were more likely to use guessing strategies in an effort to answer questions correctly. Distracter analysis suggests near-total reliance on test-taking strategies.

### Kidney biopsy in patients with glomerulonephritis: Is the earlier the better [^1129U2sm]? BMC Nephrology (2012). Low credibility.

The time points when interventions should be recommended have been investigated and established in multiple fields of medicine. For patients with renal disease, a kidney biopsy can be necessary for diagnosis and treatment selection. Technical advances such as real-time ultrasound and automated biopsy needles have improved the general implementation of this procedure. Major complications occur in less than 0.1% of kidney biopsies.

The incidence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is increasing in Western communities, and outcomes are poor. The number of patients with CKD undergoing maintenance hemodialysis is expected to rise further. Complications of decreased kidney function or concomitant cardiovascular disease (CVD) may be preventable by early diagnosis and treatment. However, CKD is frequently underdiagnosed and undertreated.

There is insufficient evidence to conclude the best timing of invasive diagnostic procedures in patients with several kidney diseases. An early kidney biopsy may be of particular interest for those patients where disease classification is based on histological diagnosis and where the disease progression can be mitigated by treatment. While guidelines have established the medical management of glomerulonephritis (GN), including the necessity of histological analysis and administration of immunosuppressive therapies, it remains unclear if early diagnosis may result in the prevention of CKD development in this heterogeneous group of patients.

We, therefore, performed a retrospective analysis to address the question of whether early diagnosis of GN from an…

### Manifestations of complement-mediated and immune complex-mediated membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis: A comparative consecutive series [^114RRWM2]. Ophthalmology (2016). Low credibility.

Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN) was recently reclassified to reflect its underlying causes as either a complement-mediated or immune complex-mediated disease. This new classification relies on renal biopsy immunofluorescence examination, rendering the former electron-microscopy classification obsolete. In this report, we describe related eye findings in patients with MPGN according to this new classification.

The study was a retrospective case series involving all Mayo Clinic Rochester patients with pathology-confirmed complement- and immune complex-mediated MPGN who had available ophthalmology records from 1997 through 2014. The medical and pathologic records of these patients, along with their eye examination results, were reviewed.

- **Main outcome measures**: The number of patients and the number of eyes with MPGN-related pathologic features were examined. Visual acuity was also considered.

The results indicated that there were 23 patients with complement-mediated MPGN and available eye examination results. Among these, 9 patients (39%) and 17 eyes (37%) exhibited retinal pathologic features likely related to the same underlying pathophysiologic process as their renal disease. Additionally, 5 patients (22%) and 6 eyes (13%) experienced significant vision loss. Conversely, among the 23 patients with immune complex-mediated MPGN and available eye examination results, only 2 patients (9%), accounting for 4 eyes, showed retinal pathologic features that could potentially be related to the same underlying pathophysiologic process as their renal disease, and neither experienced vision loss.

### The management of membranous nephropathy-an update [^113Gx43x]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2022). High credibility.

In recent decades, several important advances have taken place in the understanding of the pathogenesis underlying membranous nephropathy (MN) that have sparked renewed interest in its management. Four landmark trials in MN, along with a fifth clinical trial — a pilot study — have been published in recent years. The results from some of these trials have had a significant impact on the recommendations included in the 2021 Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) Guideline for the Management of Glomerular Diseases, representing a significant step forward compared with the previous guideline in several aspects, including diagnosis, disease monitoring, and treatment strategies. However, considering the rapidly evolving advances in the knowledge of MN and the recent publication of the STARMEN and RI-CYCLO trials, several recommendations contained in the guideline warrant updates. This article provides a perspective of the Immunonephrology Working Group of the European Renal Association regarding the management of MN in native kidneys of adult patients.

### Diagnostic tests and treatment options in glomerular disease: 2014 update [^114LdPAy]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Glomerular diseases historically have been challenging disorders to comprehend and treat for patients and physicians alike. Kidney biopsy is the gold standard of diagnosis, but the link between pathophysiology and the histological representation of kidney injury has remained elusive in many of these diseases. As a result, treatment of glomerular disease usually involves therapies that are not specific to disease pathogenesis, such as blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and various immunosuppression regimens.

Recent research has resulted in greater insight into some glomerular diseases, leading to the hope that new diagnostic tests and treatments targeting disease-specific mechanisms are on the horizon. We review recent progress on the understanding, diagnosis, and treatment of four glomerular diseases: immunoglobulin A nephropathy, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, C3 glomerulopathies, and idiopathic membranous nephropathy.

### Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis: No longer the same disease and may need very different treatment [^113k9FBs]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2023). High credibility.

Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN) is a pattern of glomerular injury that may be primary or secondary to infections, autoimmune diseases, and hematological disorders. Primary C3G and IC-MPGN are rare and the prognosis is unfavorable. Based on immunofluorescence findings, MPGN has been classified into complement-mediated C3 glomerulopathy (C3G) and immune complex-mediated MPGN (IC-MPGN). However, this classification leaves several issues unresolved. The finding of genetic and acquired complement abnormalities in both C3G and IC-MPGN indicates they represent a heterogeneous spectrum rather than distinct diseases.

An unsupervised hierarchical clustering in a cohort of patients with primary C3G and IC-MPGN identified four distinct pathogenetic patterns, characterized by specific histologic and clinical features, and genetic and acquired complement abnormalities. These results provide the groundwork for a more accurate diagnosis and the development of targeted therapies.

The drugs currently used, such as corticosteroids and immunosuppressants, are frequently ineffective in primary C3G and IC-MPGN. Eculizumab, an anti-C5 monoclonal antibody, has been used occasionally in single cases or small series; however, only a few patients have achieved remission. This heterogeneous response could be related to the extent of terminal complement activation, which may vary substantially from patient to patient. Several drugs targeting the complement system at different levels are under investigation for C3G and IC-MPGN.

### Idiopathic membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis: Does it exist [^116RasWB]? Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2012). Low credibility.

When membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN) was first delineated as a discrete clinico-pathological entity more than a half-century ago, most cases were regarded as idiopathic (or primary) in nature. Advances in the analysis of pathogenetic mechanisms and the etiologies underlying the lesion of MPGN have radically altered the prevalence of the truly idiopathic form of MPGN. In addition, MPGN as a category among renal biopsies showing glomerulonephritis has diminished over time.

In the modern era, MPGN is mainly classified morphologically on the basis of immunoglobulin (Ig; monoclonal or polyclonal) and complement (C3 only or combined with Ig) deposition and secondarily on the basis of its appearance on ultra-structural examination. Idiopathic MPGN is a diagnosis of exclusion, at least in many adults and a portion of children, and a systematic approach to evaluation will often uncover a secondary cause, such as an infection, autoimmune disease, monoclonal gammopathy, neoplasia, complement dysregulation, or a chronic thrombotic microangiopathy. Idiopathic MPGN remains an 'endangered species' after its separation from these known causes.

Whereas early classifications of membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN) were based on morphologic features, the modern approach is directed at immunofluorescence findings. Glomerular deposits of C3 alone, without immunoglobulin, are the hallmark of alternative complement pathway dysregulation through inherited or acquired defects. These immunoglobulin-negative forms are referred to as C3 glomerulopathy, which encompasses both dense deposit disease and C3 glomerulonephritis. Distinguishing C3 glomerulopathy from immunoglobulin-mediated MPGN is opening the way to better diagnostic, prognostic, and treatment algorithms.

### Membranous-like glomerulopathy with masked IgG kappa deposits [^113Vm6G1]. Kidney International (2014). Low credibility.

The diagnostic classification of glomerulonephritis is determined by the interplay of changes observed using light, immunofluorescence, and electron microscopy of the renal biopsy. Routine direct immunofluorescence on fresh tissue is presently considered the gold standard for the detection and characterization of immune deposits. We recently identified a peculiar form of glomerular immune complex deposition wherein masked deposits required an antigen-retrieval step to be visualized. Over a 2-year period, 14 cases were characterized by numerous, large subepithelial deposits observed via electron microscopy and C3-predominant staining by routine immunofluorescence on fresh tissue, with weak to negative immunoglobulin staining. Repeat immunofluorescence after digestion of the formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue with pronase elicited strong IgG-κ staining restricted within the deposits. The patients were often young, with a mean age of 26 years, and commonly demonstrated clinical evidence of a vague autoimmune phenomenon. The clinicopathologic findings in this unusual form of glomerulopathy do not fit neatly into any currently existing diagnostic category. We have termed this unique form of glomerulopathy membranous-like glomerulopathy with masked IgG-κ deposits.

### Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis type II (dense deposit disease): an update [^114xjdCn]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2005). Low credibility.

Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis type II (MPGN II) is a rare disease characterized by the deposition of abnormal electron-dense material within the glomerular basement membrane of the kidney and often within Bruch's membrane in the eye. The diagnosis is typically made in patients between the ages of 5 and 15 years. Within 10 years, approximately half progress to end-stage renal disease, occasionally accompanied by the late comorbidity of visual impairment.

The pathophysiologic basis of MPGN II is associated with the uncontrolled systemic activation of the alternative pathway (AP) of the complement cascade. In most patients, a loss of complement regulation is caused by C3 nephritic factor, an autoantibody directed against the C3 convertase of the AP. In some patients, mutations in the factor H gene have been identified. For these patients, plasma replacement therapy can prevent renal failure. However, for the majority of patients, there is no proven effective treatment. The disease recurs in virtually all renal allografts, and a high percentage of these ultimately fail.

The development of molecular diagnostic tools and new therapies aimed at controlling the AP of the complement cascade, either locally in the kidney or at the systemic level, may lead to effective treatments for MPGN II.

### Performance on the nephrology in-training examination and ABIM nephrology certification examination outcomes [^116HKzps]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Medical specialty and subspecialty fellowship programs administer subject-specific in-training examinations to provide feedback about the level of medical knowledge to fellows preparing for subsequent board certification. This study evaluated the association between the American Society of Nephrology In-Training Examination and the American Board of Internal Medicine Nephrology Certification Examination in terms of scores and passing status.

- **Design, setting, participants, and measurements**: The study included 1,684 nephrology fellows who completed the American Society of Nephrology In-Training Examination in their second year of fellowship training between 2009 and 2014. Regression analysis examined the association between In-Training Examination and first-time Nephrology Certification Examination scores, as well as passing status relative to other standardized assessments.

- **Results**: This cohort included primarily men (62%) and international medical school graduates (62%), with fellows having an average age of 32 years old at the time of first completing the Nephrology Certification Examination. An overwhelming majority (89%) passed the Nephrology Certification on their first attempt. In-Training Examination scores showed the strongest association with first-time Nephrology Certification Examination scores, accounting for approximately 50% of the total explained variance in the model. Each standard deviation increase in In-Training Examination scores was associated with a difference of 30 units (95% confidence interval, 27 to 33) in certification performance.

### Mycophenolate mofetil or standard therapy for membranous nephropathy and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis: A pilot study [^1137UWoF]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2008). Low credibility.

The treatment regimens for patients with nephrotic syndrome due to idiopathic membranous nephropathy (MN) and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) are typically based on steroids and/or cytotoxic agents. Data on the effect of mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) for these conditions are both scarce and confounding.

- **Methods**: We compared the efficacy of an MMF-based therapy with standard therapies in inducing remission in adult nephrotics with MN and FSGS in a randomized pilot study. MMF was administered at 2 g/day for 6 months along with prednisolone at 0.5 mg/kg/day for 2–3 months. Conventional therapy consisted of prednisolone 1 mg/kg/day for 3–6 months for FSGS and alternating monthly cycles of steroids and cyclophosphamide over 6 months for MN. The primary endpoint was the change in the urinary protein/creatinine ratio.

- **Results**: A total of 54 patients (21 with MN and 33 with FSGS) were recruited; 28 patients were randomized to receive MMF (group A), and 26 were subjected to conventional treatment (group B). There was no statistically significant difference in the proportion of patients achieving remission between the two groups (64% and 80% for MN and 70% and 69% for FSGS, respectively). The frequency of relapses and the incidence of infections were similar across both groups. Notably, FSGS patients in group A achieved remission faster and required a lower cumulative dose of steroids.

- **Conclusions**: A 6-month treatment with MMF is as effective as conventional treatment for the primary management of MN and FSGS in the short term. It facilitates faster remission and reduces steroid exposure in FSGS patients. Further studies with larger sample sizes and extended follow-up periods are necessary to evaluate its impact on the preservation of kidney function.

### Consensus definitions for glomerular lesions by light and electron microscopy: Recommendations from a working group of the Renal Pathology Society [^113hWsYd]. Kidney International (2020). Low credibility.

Over the past two decades, scoring systems for multiple glomerular diseases have emerged, along with consortia of pathologists and nephrologists dedicated to studying these diseases. This includes correlating pathologic findings with clinical features and outcomes. However, members of these consortia and other renal pathologists and nephrologists face a significant limitation: a lack of uniformity and precision in clearly defining the morphologic lesions on which the scoring systems are based. To address this issue, the Renal Pathology Society organized a working group to identify the most frequently observed glomerular lesions through light microscopy and electron microscopy. The group reviewed the literature to capture the most commonly used published definitions for each lesion and determine consensus terms and definitions through a series of online and in-person meetings. These defined lesions or abnormal findings are not specific to any individual disease or subset of diseases but can be applied across the entire spectrum of glomerular diseases and in the context of different scoring systems used for evaluating and reporting these diseases. By facilitating glomerular disease research, standardized terms and definitions should help harmonize the reporting of medical kidney diseases worldwide, leading to more precise diagnoses and improved patient care.

### Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis with masked monotypic immunoglobulin deposits [^111ejzsc]. Kidney International (2015). Low credibility.

The following clinical definitions were applied: hematuria is defined as > 5 red blood cells per high-power field. Nephrotic syndrome is characterized by 24-hour urine protein > 3.5 g/day, peripheral edema, and hypoalbuminemia (1.2 mg/dl). Proteinuria is reported in g/day, when available, or as a urine protein/creatinine ratio.

- **Outcome analysis definitions**:
	- **Complete remission**: Remission of proteinuria to < 500 mg/day with normal renal function.
	- **Partial remission**: Reduction in proteinuria by at least 50% and to < 2 g/day with stable renal function (no more than a 20% increase in serum creatinine).
	- **Persistent kidney dysfunction**: Failure to meet criteria for complete or partial remission but not reaching end-stage kidney disease (includes patients with unremitting proteinuria or progressive chronic kidney disease).
	- **End-stage kidney disease**: Requiring renal replacement therapy.

### Comparison of content on the American Board of Internal Medicine Maintenance of Certification examination with conditions seen in practice by general internists [^112gkdTJ]. JAMA (2017). Low credibility.

Success on the internal medicine (IM) examination is a central requirement of the American Board of Internal Medicine's (ABIM's) Maintenance of Certification Program (MOC). Therefore, it is important to understand the degree to which this examination reflects conditions seen in practice, one dimension of content validity, which focuses on the match between content in the discipline and the topics on the examination questions.

The objective of this study was to assess whether the frequency of questions on IM-MOC examinations was concordant with the frequency of conditions seen in practice.

The design, setting, and participants involved the use of the 2010–2013 IM-MOC examinations to calculate the percentage of questions for 186 medical condition categories from the examination blueprint. This blueprint balances examination content by considering the importance and frequency of conditions seen in practice. Nationally representative estimates of conditions seen in practice by general internists were derived from the primary diagnosis for 13,832 office visits (2010–2013 National Ambulatory Medical Care Surveys) and 108,472 hospital stays (2010 National Hospital Discharge Survey).

- **Exposures**: Prevalence of conditions included on the IM-MOC examination questions.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: The outcome measure was the concordance between the percentages of IM-MOC examination questions and the percentages of conditions seen in practice during either office visits or hospital stays for each of the 186 condition categories (e.g. diabetes mellitus, ischemic heart disease, liver disease).

### Atypical haemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) and membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN), various diseases or a spectrum of complement-mediated glomerular diseases [^115tPxnR]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Low credibility.

Historically, patients with kidney diseases caused by genetic or acquired dysregulation of the complement alternative pathway have been grouped into clinical syndromes: C3 glomerulopathy (C3GN/DDD) and thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA), specifically atypical haemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS). Recent data suggest that these diseases share a common pathophysiology and that patients can transition between glomerulopathies in this spectrum.

- **Histopathologically**: The main difference cited is the immunofluorescence (IF) findings, with C3 predominance in C3 glomerulopathy (compared with immunoglobulins and complements in immune complex-mediated membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN)) and negative IF in TMA.

We report a case in which a patient presented with hypertension, seizures, proteinuria, renal impairment, and immune complex-mediated MPGN on kidney biopsy. Months later, she presented with classical TMA. She failed to respond to steroids and plasma exchange therapy but subsequently made a remarkable haematological and renal recovery after eculizumab treatment, thus supporting an underlying complement dysregulation and a diagnosis of aHUS.

### Membranous nephropathy in patients with HIV: A report of 11 cases [^113sEEzt]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Low credibility.

The spectrum of renal pathology in patients infected with HIV is broad and includes HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN), focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), thrombotic microangiopathy, and HIV-associated immune complex kidney disease (HIVICK), among others. HIVICK is a heterogeneous category of disease, comprised of specific, well-characterized glomerular diseases (e.g. IgA nephropathy, membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis, membranous nephropathy) as well as immune-complex mediated diseases not otherwise specified, including those with "lupus-like" features. In the era of antiretroviral therapy, some biopsy series in patients infected with HIV have suggested that the prevalence of HIVICK exceeds that of HIVAN. The precise role that HIV plays in the development of HIVICK remains unknown, and studies of clinical outcomes in HIVICK have been hampered largely by small sample sizes and the heterogeneity of diseases falling into this umbrella category.

Among patients with HIVICK, membranous nephropathy (MN) has been reported in approximately 3–30% of cases. Several studies have demonstrated that patients with HIV and MN are often co-infected with hepatitis C (HCV), hepatitis B viruses (HBV), and/or syphilis, which are themselves independently associated with MN, challenging a causal association between MN and HIV. At the time of writing, no study specifically investigating MN in patients with HIV who lack known co-infections has been reported. In the past decade, many important advances in the understanding of idiopathic MN have been made, including the discovery of ant.

### Diagnosis of membranous nephropathy with anti-GBM glomerulonephritis: A case series report [^111pBQze]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Low credibility.

- **Clinical features**: The clinical features of anti-GBM patients with membranous nephropathy include indicators such as acute kidney injury (AKI) and instances requiring renal replacement therapy (AKI-RRT). Additional factors include white blood cell (WBC) count, anti-neutrophil cytoplasm antibody (ANCA) presence, and the status of the M-type phospholipase A2 receptor (PLA2R). Chronic kidney disease (CKD) stages and outpatient (OP) visit histories are also documented.

- **Pathological features**: Pathological examination of anti-GBM patients with membranous nephropathy demonstrates specific glomerular characteristics. A semi-quantitative scoring of tubulointerstitial lesions is utilized, where a score of 0 represents 0% cortical area or tubules involved, score 1 represents 25% involvement, score 2 depicts 25–50% involvement, while a score of 3 indicates more than 50% involvement.

- **IgG subclass and PLA2R distribution**: Analysis of IgG subclass and PLA2R distribution is crucial for understanding the pattern within anti-GBM patients with membranous nephropathy. This aids in illuminating the immunopathological landscape specific to this co-occurrence.

Note: Abbreviations used include GBM for the glomerular basement membrane, MN for membranous nephropathy, and IgG for immunoglobulin G.

In conclusion, our study identified chronic damage greater than 50% of the interstitium as an independent predictor of kidney progression to ESKD in primary membranous nephropathy (pMN). The grade of tubulointerstitial lesions, referred to as "T", should be considered important in the histopathological report of pMN.

### Membranous nephropathy with crescents [^114RDT7U]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2011). Low credibility.

Membranous nephropathy is a common cause of nephrotic syndrome in adults and can be primary or secondary to systemic lupus erythematosus, chronic infection, or drugs. Rapid decline in renal function in patients with membranous nephropathy may be due to renal vein thrombosis, malignant hypertension, or an additional superimposed destructive process involving the renal parenchyma. Crescents are rare in primary membranous nephropathy and thus suggest another underlying disease process, such as combined membranous and focal or diffuse lupus nephritis. However, in some patients with membranous nephropathy and crescents, the crescentic lesion may be due to a distinct, separate disease process, such as anti-glomerular basement membrane antibodies or anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies-related pauci-immune glomerulonephritis. Here, we describe a case with such renal biopsy findings, review previously reported cases, and discuss possible implications for the pathogenesis of the coexistence of these lesions.

### Performance on the American Board of Family Medicine certification examination by country of medical training [^111yYci8]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Performance on the American Board of Family Medicine (ABFM) Certification and Recertification Examinations by the country of medical school training has not been examined. Based on internal medicine patterns, we hypothesize that examinees trained in the United States and Canada would outperform examinees trained in other countries.

- **Methods**: In this retrospective cohort study from 2004 to 2011, data on the ABFM examinations were obtained from the ABFM. Fisher's exact and χ² tests were performed across years based on the country of examinee training. Simple linear regression was performed to evaluate pass rates over time. All statistics were conducted using an α = 0.05.

- **Results**: The overall pass rate over the study period was 84.4% (74,821 of 88,680). The pass rate for US medical graduates (USMGs) was 88.3% (60,328 of 68,332). The pass rate for Canadian medical graduates (CMGs) was 93.8% (872 of 930). The pass rate for non-Canadian foreign medical graduates (NC-FMGs) was 70.1% (13,621 of 19,418). CMGs had a higher pass rate than USMGs (P < .001) and NC-FMGs (P < .001). Simple linear regression showed significant decreasing trends over time for all examinees (P = 0.02), for USMGs (P = 0.02), and for CMGs (P = 0.02).

- **Conclusions**: USMGs and CMGs outperform NC-FMGs on the ABFM certification and recertification examinations. These findings may alter acceptance patterns for family medicine residency programs.

### Membranous nephropathy with crescents: a series of 19 cases [^112SaoBS]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Membranous nephropathy (MN) with crescents is rare and, in the absence of lupus, is usually associated with anti-glomerular basement membrane (anti-GBM) nephritis or antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-positive glomerulonephritis. Only rare cases of crescentic MN without ANCA or anti-GBM have been reported.

- **Study design**: Case series.

- **Setting & participants**: 19 patients with ANCA- and anti-GBM-negative crescentic MN and no clinical evidence of systemic lupus.

- **Outcomes**: Clinical features, kidney biopsy findings, laboratory results, treatment, and follow-up of patients with crescentic MN.

- **Results**: The mean age was 55 years (range, 5–86 years). All patients presented with proteinuria (mean protein excretion, 11.5 g/d, range 3.3–29 g/d) and nearly all had hematuria; 16 of 19 (84%) patients had decreased estimated glomerular filtration rates (eGFRs; mean serum creatinine, 2.9 mg/dL, range 0.4–10 mg/dL; mean eGFR, 39.7 mL/min/1.73 m², range 4 to > 100 mL/min/1.73 m²). The glomeruli showed on average 25% involvement by crescents (range, 2%-73%). All showed a membranous pattern; 7 showed mesangial and 2 showed segmental endocapillary proliferation. By immunofluorescence, all cases showed granular subepithelial immunoglobulin G (IgG) and κ and λ light chains. All but one showed C3; 5 showed C1q or IgA. Electron microscopy revealed stages I-III MN; 38% of cases were M-type phospholipase A2 receptor (PLA2R) associated, indicating that at least some were primary MN. Follow-up clinical data were available for all patients (mean, 22 months; range, 1.5–138 months). 14 patients received immunosuppressive therapy.

### American Board of Internal Medicine nephrology procedure requirements for initial certification: Time for a change and pursuing consensus in the nephrology community [^111QnoKu]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2024). Low credibility.

In 1988, the American Board of Internal Medicine (ABIM) defined essential procedural skills in nephrology, requiring candidates for ABIM certification to demonstrate proficiency in temporary dialysis vascular access, hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, and percutaneous renal biopsy. In 1996, continuous renal replacement therapy was added to these procedural requirements. Despite significant changes in nephrology practice, these requirements have remained unaltered since 1996.

In March 2021, the ABIM Nephrology Board initiated a policy revision to update the nephrology certification requirements. Guided by input from nephrology diplomates, training program directors, professional and patient organizations, and other stakeholders, the ABIM Nephrology Board revised these requirements to align with current practice and national priorities. The approved changes introduce the "Opportunity to Train" standard for temporary dialysis catheters, percutaneous kidney biopsies, and home hemodialysis. This reflects the prevalent state of training in most programs and aligns with the national priority to address the underuse of home dialysis therapies. This perspective outlines the ABIM's process for revising certification procedures and details their collaboration with the broader nephrology community to consider updates and additions to these requirements.

### Diagnosis of membranous nephropathy with anti-GBM glomerulonephritis: A case series report [^116dkGAM]. BMC Nephrology (2024). High credibility.

Membranous nephropathy (MN) is a common cause of nephrotic syndrome in adults, characterized by the presence of subepithelial immune complexes followed by complement activation, basement membrane damage, and proteinuria. Fibrinoid necrosis and crescent formation are rarely encountered with MN. MN with crescents may occur as a "dual glomerulopathy" with superimposed antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated crescentic glomerulonephritis or, less often, anti-glomerular basement membrane (anti-GBM) antibodies. The combination of MN and anti-GBM disease has been well documented since the first report in 1974. This dual glomerulopathy likely represents the coincidental occurrence of two separate disease processes, MN followed by anti-GBM disease or the simultaneous presence of the two diseases. Occasionally, anti-GBM followed by MN has also been reported in individual cases.

We report three cases of MN with anti-GBM disease and analyzed their clinical and pathological characteristics. The correct diagnosis of MN with anti-GBM disease should rely on a combination of renal biopsy findings and serological testing.

### Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis with masked monotypic immunoglobulin deposits [^1119vBMF]. Kidney International (2015). Low credibility.

Glomerular involvement is not uncommonly present in patients with paraproteinemia. The paraprotein-associated glomerulopathies are classified according to the findings on renal biopsy utilizing light microscopy, immunofluorescence (IF), and electron microscopy in combination with the clinical information. Glomerular disorders in this category include immunoglobulin (Ig)-related amyloidosis, immunotactoid GN, type 1 cryoglobulinemic GN, monoclonal Ig deposition disease, proliferative GN with monoclonal Ig deposits, and C3 glomerulopathy with monoclonal gammopathy. These cases commonly fall into the category of monoclonal gammopathy of renal significance when the associated hematological process does not meet diagnostic criteria for overt multiple myeloma or B-cell lymphoma. Even in the lack of a diagnostic hematological process, the monoclonal Ig can have serious renal consequences, and treatment of the underlying clonal process is frequently warranted.

It has recently been reported that Ig proteins occasionally show false negative staining by routine IF. These deposits can be "unmasked" by performing IF on the formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue after protease digestion (paraffin IF). Applying this technique to cases that show a membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN) pattern has enabled this case series detailing the first clinicopathological description of glomerulopathy with an MPGN pattern by light microscopy and masked monotypic Ig deposits by IF. All these patients had an associated underlying clonal hematological disorder, and many of them would have been misdiagnosed.

Renal and urinary disorders include glomerulonephritis membranous, glomerulonephritis mesangioproliferative, nephrolithiasis, and renal impairment.

Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: Pruritus and rash.

- **Laboratory abnormalities**: Selected laboratory abnormalities with a worsening grade from baseline, representing the worst-grade toxicity in at least 2% of subjects in the Week 48 pooled analysis, are presented in Table 3. In the Week 148 pooled analyses, no additional selected laboratory abnormalities were observed with dolutegravir plus rilpivirine compared to those shown in Table 3.

- **Changes in serum creatinine**: Dolutegravir and rilpivirine have been shown to increase serum creatinine due to inhibition of tubular secretion of creatinine without affecting renal glomerular function [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. Increases in serum creatinine occurred within the first 4 weeks of treatment with dolutegravir plus rilpivirine and remained stable through 148 weeks. Mean changes from baseline of 0.093 mg/dL (range: -0.30 to 0.58 mg/dL) and 0.112 mg/dL (range: -0.24 to 0.81 mg/dL) were observed after 48 and 148 weeks of treatment with dolutegravir plus rilpivirine, respectively. These changes are not considered to be clinically relevant.

### Case report: A man with untreated rheumatoid arthritis, cryoglobulinemic vasculitis, membranous nephropathy and pulmonary sarcoidosis [^111pPyFX]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Low credibility.

Renal involvement in cryoglobulinemic vasculitis was not included during the development of the aforementioned GISC criteria. Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN) was known to be the predominant histologic pattern in cryoglobulinemic vasculitis. In a retrospective analysis of 62 cases of non-infectious mixed cryoglobulinemic glomerulonephritis (GN) identified in the French CryoVas Survey, 92.5% of the cases showed a pathological feature of MPGN, with mesangial proliferative GN constituting the rest of the pathology and none of the cases exhibiting a membranous pattern on biopsy.

On a detailed review of the renal pathology of our patient, there were rare eosinophilic intracapillary thrombi (Figs. 2, 3), traditionally viewed as a characteristic feature of cryoglobulinemic GN, correlating with rapid immunoglobulin (often IgM) deposition into the glomerular basement membrane. However, the specificity of this feature is less clear in the background of membranous GN, instead of MPGN.

Bone marrow transplant nephropathy is a known complication of bone marrow transplantation. Bone marrow transplantation can cause various rare kidney diseases such as membranous nephropathy and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. Idiopathic membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis is rare in children. Here, the authors report on a 5-year-old pediatric autologous stem cell recipient, in whom type I membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis developed 111 days after bone marrow transplantation and presented with hematuria, hypertension, proteinuria, and renal failure.

### Pathogenesis of the C3 glomerulopathies and reclassification of MPGN [^1147Vguy]. Nature Reviews Nephrology (2012). Low credibility.

Until recently, membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN) was clinically classified as either primary, idiopathic MPGN, or as secondary MPGN when an underlying aetiology was identifiable. Primary MPGN was further classified into three types — type I, type II, and type III — based principally on the ultrastructural appearance and location of electron-dense deposits. Both the clinical and histopathologic schemes presented problems, as neither was based on disease pathogenesis.

An improved understanding of the role of complement in the pathogenesis of MPGN has led to a proposed reclassification into immunoglobulin-mediated disease (driven by the classical complement pathway) and non-immunoglobulin-mediated disease (driven by the alternative complement pathway). This reclassification has led to improved diagnostic clinical algorithms and the emergence of a new grouping of diseases known as the C3 glomerulopathies, best represented by dense deposit disease and C3 glomerulonephritis.

In this review, we re-examine the previous classification schemes of MPGN, focusing on the role of complement. We survey data about the pathogenesis of the C3 glomerulopathies, including familial studies and patient cohorts from the United States and Europe. In addition, we discuss the diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of the C3 glomerulopathies.

### Standardized classification and reporting of glomerulonephritis [^113w823F]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2019). Low credibility.

A kidney biopsy is performed to determine the etiology of the glomerulonephritis (GN) and the severity of the lesion. It helps identify whether other lesions, related or unrelated to the GN, are present on the kidney biopsy, and ascertains the extent of chronicity of the GN. The etiology of GN is based on its classification into five groups: immune complex-mediated GN, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated GN, anti-glomerular basement membrane (GBM) GN, monoclonal immunoglobulin-mediated GN, and C3 glomerulopathy.

Immune complex GN includes multiple specific diseases such as lupus nephritis, IgA nephropathy, infection-related GN, and fibrillary GN. ANCA GN, anti-GBM GN, and C3 glomerulopathy are specific diseases in themselves, while monoclonal Ig GN includes proliferative GN with monoclonal Ig deposits and monoclonal Ig deposition disease. Identification of the class of GN and the specific disease within it determines the etiology of GN. Ancillary studies may be required to confirm the etiology.

The severity of GN is revealed by the pattern of injury, which may include crescentic, necrotizing, diffuse proliferative, exudative, membranoproliferative, mesangial proliferative, or sclerosing GN. Secondary diagnoses, whether related or unrelated to the GN, such as diabetic glomerulosclerosis, acute tubular necrosis, or thrombotic microangiopathy, may also be present and can sometimes be the reason for the kidney biopsy. The chronicity of GN is determined by evaluating the extent of glomerulosclerosis, tubular atrophy, and interstitial fibrosis.

Regarding the medical management of membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis, specifically in the context of immune complex-mediated MPGN, the KDIGO 2021 guidelines recommend considering the initiation of supportive therapy with RAAS inhibition alone. This is advised for patients with idiopathic immune complex-mediated glomerulonephritis who have proteinuria < 3.5 g/day, absence of nephrotic syndrome, and normal eGFR.

### Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis with masked monotypic immunoglobulin deposits [^116Jm16w]. Kidney International (2015). Low credibility.

To determine whether the ultrastructural findings can predict whether paraffin IF will show monoclonal deposits or not in patients with clinical evidence of monoclonal gammopathy and renal biopsy findings that would have been consistent with C3 GN based on frozen IF only, we compared the ultrastructural findings of seven cases of true C3 GN with monoclonal gammopathy (without masked monoclonal deposits) versus four cases of MPGN with masked monoclonal deposits and staining for C3 only on frozen tissue from the Mayo cohort. As evident from the data in Supplementary Table S1 online, subepithelial 'humps', intramembranous deposits, or deposits with only mild electron density, seen in 43%, 57%, and 29% of cases of true C3 GN with monoclonal gammopathy, respectively, were not present in any case of MPGN with masked monoclonal deposits, while organized deposits were only seen in MPGN with masked monoclonal deposits.

Follow-up data was available in 10 patients with a mean follow-up of 12.2 months (2–27 months). The medications used in the treatment of each patient are listed in Table 1. Most of these patients were treated with a therapy directed against the underlying hematological neoplasia, if present. At follow-up, 2 (20%) had partial remissions, 6 (60%) had persistent renal dysfunction, and 1 patient progressed to end-stage renal disease. The remaining patient had normalization of serum creatinine, but follow-up 24-hour urinary protein collection was not available.

### Distribution of IgG subclasses in a biopsy specimen showing membranous nephropathy with anti-glomerular basement membrane glomerulonephritis: an uncharacteristically good outcome with corticosteroid therapy [^115wAaEj]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Few occurrences of anti-glomerular basement membrane glomerulonephritis superimposed on membranous nephropathy have been reported; most reported cases began as membranous nephropathy. Little is known about the etiology, pathogenesis, or immunoglobulin G subclasses in glomerular basement membrane deposits in these combined cases. The authors report the case of an elderly patient with apparently simultaneous onset of both membranous nephropathy and anti-glomerular basement membrane glomerulonephritis who had an excellent outcome with only pulse corticosteroid therapy. Successive renal biopsy specimens showed occurrence and disappearance of immunoglobulin G4 deposits in the glomerular basement membrane. Immunoglobulin G subclass analysis was important in recognizing membranous nephropathy underlying the anti-glomerular basement membrane disease.

### The five types of glomerulonephritis classified by pathogenesis, activity and chronicity (GN-AC) [^112YLhDF]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2023). Low credibility.

The lesion-based diagnostic approach acts as a barrier to understanding and managing glomerulonephritis (GN). Some examples illustrate better the limitations of this approach:

- **Mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN)**: MPGN is perhaps the best example of how using descriptive terms can hamper progress by causing confusion. The broad differential diagnosis of MPGN encompasses completely different disorders with different therapies, disqualifying the use of this term to define a disease entity. The lesion pattern of MPGN can be replaced easily by more specific histopathological descriptions such as immune complex GN (infection or autoimmune), MGRS (monotypic deposits), or C3GN (absence or low Ig levels in the presence of C3).

- **C3 glomerulonephritis (C3GN)**: This term may encompass a genetic disease, autoimmunity, or a monoclonal gammopathy as the underlying disease requiring different treatments. Even though the upcoming complement inhibitors may show effects on all forms of C3GN, a detailed diagnostic work-up of C3GNs, for the sake of correct categorization, may still be needed to define adjunct and duration of treatment. For example, monoclonal gammopathy–related C3GN may require additional therapeutics.

- **Lupus nephritis**: This condition remains categorized by World Health Organization or International Society of Nephrology/Renal Pathology Society classes, which do not accurately reflect the extent of the disease, do not clearly predict long-term outcomes, and do not define clinical management. Re-biopsy studies comparing classes in first and second biopsies are often distracting, while activity and chronicity indices are likely to guide lupus nephritis management.

### Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis with masked monotypic immunoglobulin deposits [^1128VPJ7]. Kidney International (2015). Low credibility.

Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN) is a pattern of glomerular injury recognized on kidney biopsy when glomeruli show mesangial expansion and basement membrane duplication by light microscopy. Traditionally, MPGN has been divided into three categories based on the appearance and location of the immune deposits by electron microscopy (types 1, 2, and 3). More recently, a shift has been made toward a pathogenesis-based classification system based on the pattern of staining by immunofluorescence (IF). Specifically, biopsies that show the light and electron microscopic findings of MPGN are now categorized as C3 glomerulopathy when there is C3-only or dominant staining as identified by IF. This is an important distinction, as this designation implies a unique pathogenesis in which the glomerular disease is driven by abnormalities of the alternative complement cascade.

'C3 GN with monoclonal gammopathy' is a subtype of C3 glomerulopathy characterized by C3 deposition in the glomeruli with little to no immunoglobulin (Ig) in the setting of a monoclonal gammopathy. The paraprotein in these cases is thought to cause glomerulonephritis (GN) indirectly through interacting with complement regulatory proteins, leading to overactivation of the alternative complement pathway. However, based on the findings in this study, it is likely that at least some of these cases are caused by paraprotein deposition in the glomeruli resulting in injury.

The underlying pathogenic driver of this disease is the presence of a clonal plasma cell or B cell population in most cases. It is therefore best considered a hematological disorder-associated GN as far as treatment is concerned.

### C3 glomerulopathy: Consensus report [^112KS5ZL]. Kidney International (2013). Low credibility.

More information is required on the relationship of morphological changes in biopsies with clinical features, clinical course, and outcome.

- **Specific questions include**: What features on biopsy are best predictive of clinical course? Are there correlations between biopsy appearances and underlying pathogenic processes, particularly specific genetic mutations? Are there characteristic electron microscopic features that are suggestive of C3 glomerulonephritis? Which C3 fragments are deposited in glomeruli in C3 glomerulopathy, and is there any significance to their relative locations? Are these C3 fragments different from those seen in either 'MPGN type I with immunoglobulin deposits' or those seen in typical post-infectious GN? What is the etiologic and clinical significance of subepithelial hump-shaped deposits in cases of C3 glomerulopathy? How can we refine the diagnosis of C3 glomerulopathy to deal with those cases that also have immunoglobulin deposits?

### Membranous nephropathy: When and how to treat [^113oqbGy]. Kidney International (2007). Low credibility.

The treatment of idiopathic membranous nephropathy is heavily debated because of the wide variation in outcomes. A rational treatment strategy is needed to appropriately administer conservative treatment to the low-risk group and immunosuppressive therapy to those with a medium or high risk of renal deterioration. Currently, combinations of steroids with alkylating agents are the best studied. Newer forms of immunosuppressive treatments are currently under study.

### Kidney biopsy in patients with glomerulonephritis: Is the earlier the better [^113krqU4]. BMC Nephrology (2012). Low credibility.

A limitation of the analysis of efficiency of drug treatment is the fact that response rates have improved over time by the availability of refined dosing schemes and new drugs. However, this does not limit the principal finding of this observational study because no therapy was withheld, and all patients had access to optimized medical treatment provided by the national sickness fund during the observation period. This study has not compared individual treatments within groups of patients with different GN entities, and numbers within subgroups are too small for such analysis.

While this is a large study, the median follow-up is 4 years, which may not be long enough to observe clinically relevant outcomes or progression in diseases such as IgA nephropathy or membranous nephropathy. A further limitation of our study is that only a controlled interventional trial may demonstrate if baseline differences may account for the results seen. However, ethical concerns prevent the conduct of such a trial.

### Typical MPGN with few urinary abnormalities [^114N58tx]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

We describe the appearance of membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN) in renal biopsy samples, with normal urinary sediment, absence of hematuria, proteinuria, or renal dysfunction in one child, and asymptomatic microscopic hematuria without significant proteinuria or renal dysfunction in two children who were subsequently followed for many years. The only other abnormality detected was hypocomplementemia. This is the first report of biopsy-proven typical MPGN in patients with few urinary abnormalities. A renal biopsy should be considered in children with hypocomplementemia, regardless of urinalysis findings, to exclude MPGN.

### The ASN in-training examination and the ABIM certifying examination: Time for a new testing paradigm [^113jga51]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2010). Low credibility.

In 2009, a new computer-based in-training examination (ITE) was created by the American Society of Nephrology (ASN) in conjunction with the National Board of Medical Examiners to assess the medical knowledge of fellows training in nephrology. The ITE, patterned after the American Board of Internal Medicine certifying examination for nephrology (ABIM-CE), allowed fellows and training program directors (TPDs) to compare their performance with programs across the nation. Despite using case vignettes to simulate real-life clinical experiences, the nation's graduating fellows answered a mean of only 69% of the questions correctly. Although unpublicized, the ABIM-CE passing grade can be estimated to be approximately 65%, resulting in a passing rate of 94%. The ABIM states that they test 85% synthesis and clinical judgment rather than recall memory.

So, are we to conclude from these two exams that the medical knowledge of our graduating nephrology fellows allows them to properly manage only about two-thirds of their patients? Rather, the construction of the test questions and their relevance to clinical practice should be reassessed. The time has come for a new testing paradigm, one that would require candidates passing the ABIM-CE to score 85% to 90% correct answers to more relevant "core" examination questions that assess the actual medical knowledge needed to practice competently in our subspecialty. If the ABIM-CE was revised, the ASN ITE, with no specific passing grade, could then test core and "factual" recall knowledge with feedback of questions to TPDs.

### Deep learning-based framework for the distinction of membranous nephropathy: A new approach through hyperspectral imagery [^1152Fm9c]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Low credibility.

Membranous nephropathy (MN) is one of the most common causes of nephrotic syndrome in adult patients across all ethnicities, often leading to end-stage renal disease. Data confirmed that MN accounts for approximately 20–40% of all patients with nephrotic syndrome worldwide. Most cases of MN are idiopathic membranous nephropathy (IMN), while the rest are secondary membranous nephropathy (SMN) attributed to various causes, including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), malignancy, and hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. More than 257 million individuals worldwide are estimated to suffer from chronic HBV infection, leading to nearly 1 million deaths annually. HBV infection is common in China, with approximately 20% of patients with HBV infection developing extrahepatic manifestations. Among these, HBV-related membranous nephropathy is a frequent outcome.

The most crucial part of MN diagnosis is distinguishing between idiopathic and secondary disease based on laboratory examinations and renal biopsy outcomes. These values determine specific treatment decisions and guide long-term prognosis. Conventional approaches to detecting glomerular hepatitis antigen/antibody include positive immunofluorescence outcomes and specific pathological features found in renal biopsy tissue using light and electron microscopy. In theory, IMN patients are associated with only immune complex deposition under the epithelial tissue and a thickening glomerular basement membrane (GBM).

### Concurrent IgG4-related membranous nephropathy and proliferative diabetic kidney disease: A diagnostic dilemma and therapeutic strategy in long-standing diabetes [^116GnwQn]. BMC Nephrology (2025). High credibility.

In conclusion, this case provides several critical clinical insights into the management of complex renal disease in patients with long-standing diabetes. First, this case underscores the indispensability of renal biopsy for patients with diabetes who present with atypical features, such as nephrotic-range proteinuria disproportionate to the duration of diabetes or the degree of retinopathy. Second, the diagnosis of IgG4-MN, particularly in the absence of classic TIN, requires a comprehensive, multidisciplinary evaluation integrating serological, radiological, and extrarenal histopathological findings. Finally, this report demonstrates that a carefully tailored, low-intensity immunosuppressive regimen can achieve favorable renal outcomes without compromising metabolic control, highlighting the importance of individualized therapy in this complex, comorbid patient population. Early and accurate diagnosis is paramount to guide appropriate treatment and mitigate the risks associated with both complex renal disease and its treatment.
