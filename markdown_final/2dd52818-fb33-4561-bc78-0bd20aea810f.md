## Question

What is the relationship between vitamin D and breast cancer?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the relationship between vitamin D and breast cancer — specifically whether vitamin D influences risk and outcomes, and whether supplementation prevents cancer or improves prognosis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the biological plausibility in breast tissue. Then, I should review observational data on risk and prognosis. Next, I will examine Mendelian randomization for causal inference, followed by randomized controlled trials on incidence and mortality. After that, I should consider subgroup nuances and any therapeutic adjunct data. Finally, I need to align these findings with current guidelines and translate them into practical clinical recommendations [^113WfUua] [^1122BpPp] [^113t7XGo] [^113h9V6a].

> Let me first confirm biological plausibility. Breast epithelium expresses the vitamin D receptor and has local enzymatic capacity to convert 25(OH)D to 1,25(OH)2D, supporting autocrine and paracrine antitumor effects such as antiproliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, and immune modulation; however, some transformed tumors may downregulate the pathway, potentially blunting responsiveness, so I need to be cautious extrapolating preclinical findings to clinical benefit [^112coxLd] [^1135ptuy] [^113WfUua].

> Next, I should review observational prognostic data, but hold on, let's not jump to conclusions because confounding and reverse causation are common. Lower 25(OH)D levels at diagnosis have been associated with worse outcomes in several cohorts; for example, early-stage breast cancer patients with deficiency had higher risks of distant recurrence and death, and the Pathways Study showed lower 25(OH)D with more advanced stage and premenopausal triple-negative disease, though attenuation after multivariable adjustment suggests confounding; pooled observational analyses also link higher 25(OH)D with better survival, but these designs are inherently vulnerable to bias and single-timepoint misclassification, so I should interpret cautiously [^111XNZQw] [^112Fdzuf] [^115fFbNL] [^114rBP1s].

> I will now examine observational risk data. Some case-control and cohort studies report inverse associations between supplemental vitamin D and breast cancer risk, particularly at modest supplemental doses, and a large study among Black women suggested lower risk across subtypes with moderate supplemental vitamin D and greater sunlight exposure; but wait, let me verify consistency — dietary intake alone is often null, and several large cohorts found no association overall, highlighting residual confounding by adiposity, activity, and sun exposure, and potential measurement error in intake-based assessments [^115wxK3T] [^112ZXYNS] [^111HNEZg].

> To test causality, I need to check Mendelian randomization findings. Large MR analyses using vitamin D–related SNPs show little to no causal effect of higher lifelong 25(OH)D on breast cancer risk, which undercuts a causal interpretation of the observational inverse associations; this pattern is robust across sensitivity analyses, though very small effects cannot be entirely excluded, so the weight of causal evidence is null [^113t7XGo] [^115Xoqmr] [^116qCZ25].

> Now, let me review randomized controlled trials for primary prevention. High-credibility RCTs and meta-analyses consistently find no reduction in total cancer incidence or breast cancer incidence with vitamin D supplementation across a range of doses, including WHI with 400 IU/day plus calcium and contemporary trials with higher dosing; post hoc analyses of bolus regimens and smaller trials are likewise null for incidence, reinforcing that supplementation does not prevent breast cancer in the general population [^1122BpPp] [^113mTi9c] [^1111wEaK] [^117Prmbk] [^116VfQDV].

> But wait, I should separate incidence from mortality. Meta-analytic data indicate a modest reduction in total cancer mortality with daily vitamin D supplementation, whereas bolus dosing appears ineffective; however, this mortality signal is not breast cancer–specific, and other syntheses report attenuated or nonsignificant effects, so I need to avoid overgeneralizing this to breast cancer outcomes [^1122BpPp] [^11231SgD] [^111Cw8FU].

> Next, I should review subgroup nuances and dosing considerations. Observational signals suggest potential benefit in premenopausal women and in Black women, particularly for triple-negative disease, but RCTs have been underpowered for these strata; daily dosing may be more favorable than bolus for mortality, and achieved 25(OH)D levels could modify effects, yet even trials achieving ~48 ng/mL found no incidence reduction, which tempers enthusiasm; prognostic associations may be stronger in luminal subtypes, but again, this is observational [^111HNEZg] [^1122BpPp] [^1111wEaK] [^111izhDK].

> I need to check whether supplementation helps as an adjunct during treatment. A recent randomized single-center study during neoadjuvant chemotherapy reported higher pathological complete response with weekly 50,000 IU cholecalciferol, which is intriguing, but hold on, I should verify reproducibility and external validity; these results need replication in multicenter trials with stratification by subtype and baseline deficiency, especially since prior prospective cohorts like WHEL did not show improved recurrence with higher 25(OH)D, highlighting the inconsistency between prognostic correlation and interventional benefit [^113TWC6X] [^1151EeHz] [^115L38f7].

> Let me align this with current guidelines. The 2024 Endocrine Society suggests empiric vitamin D supplementation in adults aged 75 and older to potentially lower all-cause mortality and during pregnancy for obstetric benefits, but does not recommend vitamin D for cancer prevention or as an adjuvant breast cancer therapy, which mirrors the RCT and MR evidence base [^113h9V6a] [^117GUmKc].

> For clinical practice, I should confirm general indications to treat deficiency for bone and metabolic health, particularly in breast cancer patients at risk of osteopenia or on bone-modifying agents, where unrecognized deficiency can complicate care; I should also remember that advanced disease is often accompanied by lower 25(OH)D levels, which may reflect illness severity rather than causal involvement, so screening and repletion are reasonable for bone health but should not be framed as anticancer interventions [^112hyfi6] [^114iXNVe].

> Let me synthesize and be explicit. Biology is plausible, observational associations with risk and prognosis are frequent but likely confounded, MR does not support causality, and RCTs do not show prevention of breast cancer incidence; there may be a small reduction in overall cancer mortality with daily dosing that is not specific to breast cancer, and a single neoadjuvant adjunct trial suggests a possible benefit that requires replication; therefore, routine vitamin D supplementation should not be recommended for breast cancer prevention or recurrence reduction, though maintaining sufficiency for bone and general health is appropriate, especially in those who are deficient or at high risk for deficiency [^1122BpPp] [^113t7XGo] [^113mTi9c] [^113h9V6a].

Vitamin D status is linked to breast cancer outcomes, but **RCTs show no reduction in incidence** and only modest mortality signals [^1111wEaK] [^1122BpPp]. Observational data suggest **deficiency worsens prognosis** and is common in breast cancer patients [^111XNZQw] [^114rBP1s]. Supplementation is reasonable to correct deficiency and support bone health, but **not as a primary prevention strategy** [^113WfUua] [^112hyfi6].

---

## Biological mechanisms linking vitamin D and breast cancer

Vitamin D signals through the VDR to regulate genes involved in proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, and immune modulation; **VDR is expressed in most breast tumors** [^1135ptuy]. Preclinical data indicate that vitamin D can inhibit proliferation, induce apoptosis, and reduce invasion and metastasis, supporting a plausible anticancer role [^1135ptuy] [^112coxLd].

---

## Epidemiological evidence on vitamin D status and breast cancer risk

Observational studies are mixed: some report inverse associations between 25(OH)D and breast cancer risk, whereas others are null or inconsistent [^113WfUua] [^1135ptuy]. A meta-analysis found a modest inverse association (RR 0.89 per 25 nmol/L), but Mendelian randomization does not support causality, suggesting **no causal effect on incidence** [^115Xoqmr].

---

## Vitamin D supplementation and breast cancer incidence

RCTs have not shown reduced breast cancer incidence with supplementation. The WHI (400 IU/day) and VITAL (2000 IU/day) found no significant effect on breast cancer incidence [^11231SgD] [^113mTi9c]. A meta-analysis of 10 RCTs (including higher doses) also found no effect on total cancer incidence (RR 0.98) [^1122BpPp]. Thus, **supplementation does not prevent breast cancer**.

---

## Vitamin D status and breast cancer prognosis

Lower 25(OH)D at diagnosis is associated with higher recurrence and mortality, especially in luminal subtypes [^111XNZQw] [^113v67qn]. The Pathways Study reported lower 25(OH)D in advanced-stage and triple-negative tumors and higher recurrence and mortality in the lowest quartile [^112Fdzuf]. A meta-analysis reported a 37% reduction in breast cancer mortality for the highest vs lowest 25(OH)D quartile [^115fFbNL]. These data suggest **deficiency worsens outcomes**, though causality remains uncertain.

---

## Vitamin D supplementation and breast cancer outcomes

Evidence that supplementation improves outcomes is limited and inconsistent. Some observational studies suggest better outcomes with higher 25(OH)D, but RCTs are lacking [^113WfUua]. The WHEL study found no association between 25(OH)D or intake and recurrence overall, though a subgroup of premenopausal women showed an inverse trend with dietary vitamin D [^115L38f7]. Overall, **RCT evidence is lacking** for improved outcomes.

---

## Vitamin D status among breast cancer patients

Vitamin D deficiency is highly prevalent in breast cancer patients and survivors. In a multiethnic cohort, 75.6% had insufficiency or deficiency, with lower levels in African American and Hispanic women [^114rBP1s]. Among premenopausal women starting chemotherapy, 74% were deficient at baseline, and many remained insufficient despite 400 IU/day [^113J3MM9]. This underscores **high prevalence of deficiency** in this population.

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines do not recommend vitamin D supplementation specifically for breast cancer prevention or treatment. The Endocrine Society recommends empiric supplementation in older adults (≥ 75 years) to potentially lower mortality, but not specifically for cancer prevention [^113h9V6a]. For breast cancer patients, supplementation is advised to correct deficiency and maintain bone health, especially with bisphosphonates or aromatase inhibitors [^112hyfi6]. Thus, there is **no prevention indication**, while correction of deficiency is standard.

---

## Safety considerations and potential risks

Vitamin D supplementation is generally safe at recommended doses, but high doses can cause hypercalcemia and renal impairment. Monthly high-dose regimens did not reduce cancer incidence and may increase keratinocyte cancers in older adults [^117Prmbk] [^115K5wYw]. Routine monitoring of 25(OH)D and calcium is advised, especially with high-dose or long-term use [^112hyfi6]. Overall, **routine monitoring helps prevent toxicity**.

---

## Gaps in current research and future directions

Key gaps include the lack of large RCTs testing supplementation on breast cancer outcomes, unclear optimal 25(OH)D targets, and limited data by subtype, ethnicity, and menopausal status. Future research should prioritize **large RCTs on outcomes**, define optimal levels, and clarify subgroup effects.

Vitamin D status is associated with breast cancer prognosis, but **RCTs show no reduction in incidence** and only modest mortality signals. Supplementation is appropriate to correct deficiency and support bone health, but **not as a primary prevention strategy**.

### Prognostic effects of 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels in early breast cancer [^111XNZQw]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2009). Low credibility.

Vitamin D has been linked to breast cancer risk; however, its prognostic effects are unknown. Such effects are biologically plausible given the presence of vitamin D receptors in breast cancer cells, which act as nuclear transcription factors to regulate gene activity.

The study was conducted in a prospective inception cohort of 512 women with early breast cancer diagnosed between 1989 and 1996. Vitamin D levels were measured using stored blood samples. Additionally, clinical, pathologic, and dietary data were examined to assess the prognostic effects of vitamin D.

The mean age of participants was 50.4 years, and the mean vitamin D level was 58.1 ± 23.4 nmol/L. Vitamin D levels were found to be deficient (≤ 72 nmol/L) in 24.0% of patients. There was little variation in mean vitamin D levels between the summer and winter months. With a mean follow-up duration of 11.6 years, 116 women experienced distant recurrences, and 106 women died. Women with deficient vitamin D levels had an increased risk of distant recurrence (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.94; 95% CI, 1.16 to 3.25) and death (HR = 1.73; 95% CI, 1.05 to 2.86) compared with those with sufficient levels. This association persisted even after individual adjustment for key tumor and treatment-related factors but was attenuated in multivariate analyses (HR = 1.71; 95% CI, 1.02 to 2.86 for distant recurrence; HR = 1.60; 95% CI, 0.96 to 2.64 for death).

In conclusion, vitamin D deficiency may be associated with poor outcomes in breast cancer.

### Vitamin D supplementation and total cancer incidence and mortality: A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^1122BpPp]. Annals of Oncology (2019). High credibility.

Previous meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of vitamin D supplementation and total cancer incidence and mortality found inconsistent results, as most included trials administered generally low doses of vitamin D (≤ 1100 IU/day). We updated the meta-analysis by incorporating recent RCTs that have tested higher doses of vitamin D supplements.

- **Materials and methods**: PubMed and Embase were searched from inception to November 2018. Summary relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using a random-effects model.

- **Results**: For total cancer incidence, 10 trials were included [6537 cases; 3–10 years of follow-up; 54–135 nmol/l of attained levels of circulating 25(OH) vitamin D / 25(OH)D in the intervention group]. The summary RR was 0.98 (95% CI, 0.93–1.03; P = 0.42; I2 = 0%). The results remained null across subgroups tested, even when attained 25(OH)D levels exceeded 100 nmol/l (RR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.83–1.09; P = 0.48; I2 = 26%). For total cancer mortality, five trials were included [1591 deaths; 3–10 years of follow-up; 54–135 nmol/l of attained levels of circulating 25(OH)D in the intervention group]. The summary RR was 0.87 (95% CI, 0.79–0.96; P = 0.005; I2 = 0%), largely attributable to interventions with daily dosing (as opposed to infrequent bolus dosing). No statistically significant heterogeneity was observed by attained levels of circulating 25(OH)D (P Heterogeneity = 0.83), with RR being 0.88 (95% CI, 0.78–0.98; P = 0.02; I2 = 0%) for ≤ 100 nmol/l and 0.85 (95% CI, 0.70–1.03; P = 0.11; I2 = 0%) for levels above 100 nmol/l.

### Evaluation of vitamin D deficiency in breast cancer patients on bisphosphonates [^112hyfi6]. The Oncologist (2008). Low credibility.

Bisphosphonates are very effective in treating osteoporosis and metastatic bone disease; however, unfavorable outcomes can occur when they are given to patients with occult vitamin D deficiency. No clear consensus exists on the assessment of vitamin D status in cancer patients undergoing bisphosphonate therapy. This study examines the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency among breast cancer patients treated with bisphosphonates for osteoporosis or metastatic bone disease and observes the use of calcium and vitamin D supplementation in these patients.

- **Methods**: This retrospective study reviewed the electronic records of 321 breast cancer patients treated with bisphosphonates. Information on age, race, and serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OHD), parathyroid hormone, and calcium were collected, and intakes of calcium and vitamin D supplements were queried in an outpatient pharmacy database.

- **Results**: Of the 321 patients treated with bisphosphonates, 209 (65.1%) had their 25-OHD levels checked at least once. Of these patients, 57 (27.3%) had a serum 25-OHD level < 20 ng/mL, indicating vitamin D deficiency. In addition, 111 (53%) patients received more than 600 IU of vitamin D per day, and 41 (19.6%) patients received 400–600 IU of vitamin D daily.

- **Conclusion**: Especially in the setting of metastatic bone disease in breast cancer patients, we advocate routine 25-OHD concentration screening for vitamin D deficiency in general. Clear guidelines for the diagnosis of vitamin D deficiency in cancer patients would be extremely beneficial.

### Vitamin D and breast cancer [^113WfUua]. The Oncologist (2012). Low credibility.

In addition to its role in calcium homeostasis and bone health, vitamin D has also been reported to have anticancer activities against many cancer types, including breast cancer. The discovery that breast epithelial cells possess the same enzymatic system as the kidney, allowing local manufacture of active vitamin D from circulating precursors, makes the effect of vitamin D in breast cancer biologically plausible. Preclinical and ecological studies have suggested a role for vitamin D in breast cancer prevention. Inverse associations have been shown between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level (25(OH)D) and breast cancer development, risk for breast cancer recurrence, and mortality in women with early-stage breast cancer. Clinical trials of vitamin D supplementation, however, have yielded inconsistent results.

Regardless of whether vitamin D helps prevent breast cancer or its recurrence, vitamin D deficiency in the U.S. population is very common. The adverse impact on bone health, particularly concerning breast cancer survivors, makes it important to understand vitamin D physiology and to recognize and treat vitamin D deficiency. In this review, we discuss vitamin D metabolism and its mechanism of action. We summarize the evidence of the relationship between vitamin D and breast cancer, highlight ongoing research in this area, and discuss optimal dosing of vitamin D for breast cancer prevention.

### Vitamin D supplementation and prevention of cardiovascular disease and cancer in the Finnish Vitamin D trial: A randomized controlled trial [^1111wEaK]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2022). High credibility.

A recent meta-analysis reported that vitamin D supplementation did not reduce the total cancer incidence overall or in analyses stratified by several potential modifying factors, and our findings are in line with that observation. However, the meta-analysis did find that vitamin D supplementation decreased the incidence of cancer death. This was also observed in the VITAL study, which found a 25% lower risk of death from cancer in the analyses that excluded the first 2 years of follow-up. We were not able to investigate this outcome because there were no cancer deaths as the first incident event. Also, the numbers of prespecified secondary cancer outcomes — colorectal, breast, and prostate cancer — were very low, but the lack of an effect on these outcomes agrees with the findings in other trials.

A strength of our study was the use of two vitamin D doses, which enabled an investigation of dose-response. There were clear and sustained differences in the serum 25(OH)D concentrations between the arms, with the achieved mean level of 120 nmol/L (48 ng/mL) in the 3200 IU/day arm being close to the upper limit of 125–150 nmol/L (50–60 ng/mL) suggested by the US Institute of Medicine. Other strengths include the population-based recruitment method and the use of national health records to collect data on incident events. The extensive data collected with the study forms during the trial also allow for future investigations of several health outcomes, many of which have limited dose-response data available. Limitations include the much lower than expected recruitment rate.

### Vitamin D insufficiency in a multiethnic cohort of breast cancer survivors [^114rBP1s]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2008). Low credibility.

Little is known about vitamin D status in breast cancer survivors. This issue is important because vitamin D influences pathways related to carcinogenesis.

- **Objective**: The objective of this report was to describe and understand vitamin D status in a breast cancer survivor cohort.

- **Design**: Data are from the Health, Eating, Activity, and Lifestyle study. Using a cross-sectional design, we examined serum concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] in 790 breast cancer survivors from western Washington state, New Mexico, and Los Angeles County. Cancer treatment data were obtained from Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results registries and medical records. Fasting blood samples, anthropometry, and lifestyle habits were collected after diagnosis and treatment. We examined distributions of 25(OH)D by race-ethnicity, season, geography, and clinical characteristics. Multivariate regression tested associations between 25(OH)D and stage of disease.

- **Results**: Five hundred ninety-seven (75.6%) of the women had low serum 25(OH)D, suggesting vitamin D insufficiency or frank deficiency. The overall mean (± SD) was 24.8 ± 10.4 ng/mL, but it was lower for African Americans (18.1 ± 8.7 ng/mL) and Hispanics (22.1 ± 9.2 ng/mL). Women with localized (n = 424) or regional (n = 182) breast cancer had lower serum 25(OH)D than those with in situ disease (n = 184) (P = 0.05 and P = 0.03, respectively). Multivariate regression models, controlled for age, body mass index (in kg/m²), race-ethnicity, geography, season, physical activity, diet, and cancer treatments, showed…

### Vitamin D for the prevention of disease: An Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^113h9V6a]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for vitamin D deficiency, more specifically with respect to empiric supplementation, the ES 2024 guidelines suggest offering empiric vitamin D supplementation in the general population aged ≥ 75 years to potentially lower the risk of mortality.

### Circulating vitamin D concentration and risk of seven cancers: Mendelian randomisation study [^115Xoqmr]. BMJ (2017). Low credibility.

The prospective epidemiological evidence for an association between circulating 25(OH)D concentrations and the risk of breast cancer is inconclusive. A meta-analysis by Gandini and colleagues reported that a 25 nmol/L increment in circulating 25(OH)D concentration was associated with a relative risk of 0.89 (95% confidence interval 0.81 to 0.98). Two subsequent meta-analyses observed no association between 25(OH)D concentration and the risk of premenopausal breast cancer, whereas an inverse association was suggested for postmenopausal breast cancer. Specifically, Bauer and colleagues suggested a borderline significant inverse association for postmenopausal women with a relative risk per 12.5 nmol/L of circulating 25(OH)D of 0.97 (0.93 to 1.00).

We did not find an association between genetically determined 25(OH)D concentrations and the risk of breast cancer, and our study was powered to find minimum detectable odds ratios ranging from 0.84 to 0.87 per 25 nmol/L in 25(OH)D. Information on menopausal status was not available in the large genetic networks that we used, but most women in our sample had postmenopausal breast cancer. In agreement with our findings, the Women's Health Initiative trial of vitamin D plus calcium supplementation in postmenopausal women did not support a protective association with breast cancer (hazard ratio 0.96, 95% confidence interval 0.85 to 1.09). A large cohort consortium of 9,456 cases and 10,816 controls also found no association between the four single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with vitamin D and the risk of breast cancer.

### High prevalence of vitamin D deficiency despite supplementation in premenopausal women with breast cancer undergoing adjuvant chemotherapy [^113J3MM9]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2009). Low credibility.

Vitamin D deficiency is associated with increased breast cancer risk and decreased breast cancer survival. The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency, as measured by serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OHD), in premenopausal women at initiation of adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer and after one year of vitamin D supplementation.

The study included 103 premenopausal women from the northeastern United States with stages I to III breast cancer who received adjuvant chemotherapy and participated in a one-year zoledronate intervention trial. All patients were prescribed vitamin D(3) (cholecalciferol) 400 IU and calcium carbonate 1,000 mg daily. At baseline, and at six and twelve months, bone mineral density (BMD) measurements were obtained, and blood was collected and analyzed in batches for serum 25-OHD. Vitamin D deficiency was defined as serum 25-OHD less than 20 ng/mL, insufficiency as 20 to 29 ng/mL, and sufficiency as 30 ng/mL or greater.

At baseline, 74% of women were vitamin D deficient (median, 17 ng/mL). Vitamin D deficiency was slightly less common in white women (66%) compared with black (80%) and Hispanic (84%) women. After vitamin D supplementation for one year, less than 15% of white and Hispanic women, and no black women, achieved sufficient 25-OHD levels. Vitamin D levels did not correlate with baseline BMD and were not altered by chemotherapy or bisphosphonate use.

Vitamin D deficiency is highly prevalent in women with breast cancer. The recommended dietary allowance of vitamin D remains unmet in a significant portion of this population.

### Calcium plus vitamin D supplementation and the risk of breast cancer [^113mTi9c]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2008). Low credibility.

Although some observational studies have associated higher calcium intake and especially higher vitamin D intake and 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels with lower breast cancer risk, no randomized trial has evaluated these relationships.

- **Methods**: Postmenopausal women (N = 36,282) who were enrolled in a Women's Health Initiative clinical trial were randomly assigned to 1000 mg of elemental calcium with 400 IU of vitamin D(3) daily or placebo for a mean of 7.0 years to determine the effects of supplement use on incidence of hip fracture. Mammograms and breast exams were serially conducted. Invasive breast cancer was a secondary outcome. Baseline serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels were assessed in a nested case-control study of 1067 case patients and 1067 control subjects. A Cox proportional hazards model was used to estimate the risk of breast cancer associated with random assignment to calcium with vitamin D(3). Associations between 25-hydroxyvitamin D serum levels and total vitamin D intake, body mass index (BMI), recreational physical activity, and breast cancer risks were evaluated using logistic regression models. Statistical tests were two-sided.

- **Results**: Invasive breast cancer incidence was similar in the two groups (528 supplement vs. 546 placebo; hazard ratio = 0.96; 95% confidence interval = 0.85 to 1.09). In the nested case-control study, no effect of supplement group assignment on breast cancer risk was seen. Baseline 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels were modestly correlated with total vitamin D intake (diet and supplements) (r = 0.19, P < .001) and were higher among.

### The role of vitamin D in breast cancer risk and progression [^1135ptuy]. Endocrine-related Cancer (2022). Low credibility.

The active form of vitamin D3, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3), is primarily known as a key regulator of calcium and phosphate homeostasis. It exerts its biological functions by binding to the vitamin D receptor (VDR), a transcription factor that regulates gene expression in vitamin D-target tissues such as the intestine, kidney, and bone. Yet, the VDR is expressed in many additional normal and cancerous tissues, where it moderates the antiproliferative, prodifferentiating, and immune-modulating effects of 1,25(OH)2D3. Interestingly, several epidemiological studies show that low levels of 25(OH)D, a biological marker for 1,25(OH)2D3 status, are associated with an increased risk of breast cancer (BC) development. Mendelian randomization studies, however, did not find any relationship between single-nucleotide polymorphisms in genes associated with lower serum 25(OH)D and BC risk.

Nevertheless, multiple in vivo preclinical studies illustrate that 1,25(OH)2D3 or its less calcaemic structural analogues influence diverse cellular processes in BC such as proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, autophagy, and the epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Recent insights also demonstrate that 1,25(OH)2D3 treatment impacts cell metabolism and the cancer stem cell population. The presence of VDR in the majority of BCs, together with the various anti-tumoural effects of 1,25(OH)2D3, has supported the evaluation of the effects of vitamin D3 supplementation on BC development. However, most randomized controlled clinical trials do not demonstrate a clear decrease in BC incidence with vitamin D3 supplementation.

### Association of serum level of vitamin D at diagnosis with breast cancer survival: A case-cohort analysis in the Pathways Study [^112Fdzuf]. JAMA Oncology (2017). Low credibility.

There has been long-standing interest in the potential benefits of vitamin D for preventing breast cancer recurrence and mortality, yet data from prospective cohort studies are limited. This study investigates a serum biomarker of vitamin D status, 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) measured at the time of breast cancer diagnosis, to determine the association with prognosis.

The Pathways Study is a prospective cohort study of breast cancer survivors established in 2006, with enrollment completed in 2013 and ongoing follow-up. It was established in Kaiser Permanente Northern California, a large integrated healthcare delivery system in northern California. Women with a diagnosis of incident invasive breast cancer were typically consented and enrolled within two months of diagnosis. The overall enrollment rate was 46% (4505 of 9820). Participants are followed for health outcomes and comorbidities at 12, 24, 48, 72, and 96 months after the baseline interview. A case-cohort design was used for efficient assay of 25OHD, selecting 1666 cohort members with serum samples and ensuring representation in the subcohort of races and clinical subtypes. The data analysis was performed from January 5, 2014, to March 15, 2015.

The primary outcomes are breast cancer recurrence, second primary cancer, and death. The mean (SD) age was 58.7 (12.4) years. Serum 25OHD concentrations were lower in women with advanced-stage tumors, with the lowest levels observed in premenopausal women with triple-negative cancer.

### Targets of vitamin D receptor signaling in the mammary gland [^112coxLd]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2007). Low credibility.

Since the discovery of the vitamin D receptor (VDR) in mammary cells, the role of the vitamin D signaling pathway in normal glandular function and in breast cancer has been extensively explored. In vitro studies have shown that the VDR ligand, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25D), modulates key proteins involved in signaling proliferation, differentiation, and survival of normal mammary epithelial cells. Similar anti-proliferative and pro-differentiating effects of 1,25D have been observed in VDR-positive breast cancer cells, indicating that transformation per se does not abolish vitamin D signaling. However, many transformed breast cancers lose sensitivity to 1,25D secondary to alterations in vitamin D metabolizing enzymes or downregulation of VDR function.

Over the years, our laboratory has focused on three general areas:

- **Defining mechanisms**: Vitamin D-mediated apoptosis in breast cancer cells.
- **Examining changes**: Changes in the vitamin D signaling pathway during transformation, including the development of vitamin D resistance.
- **Using mouse models**: Studying the impact of the VDR on growth regulatory pathways in the context of development and tumorigenesis in vivo.

Recent developments include the detection of megalin-mediated uptake of vitamin D-binding protein (DBP) and the identification of CYP27B1 and CYP24 metabolizing enzymes in mammary cells. Additionally, there has been a demonstration of precocious mammary gland development in VDR-null mice and the identification of novel pathways triggered by 1,25D during apoptosis. Our preclinical studies have been complemented by emerging data from other groups.

### Vitamin D and breast cancer recurrence in the Women's Healthy Eating and Living (WHEL) study [^115L38f7]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2011). Low credibility.

There is a paucity of research evaluating the relation between vitamin D and recurrence of breast cancer after treatment.

- **Objective**: This study was designed to evaluate the associations between circulating concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] and dietary, supplemental, and total intake of vitamin D and new breast cancer events within the Women's Healthy Eating and Living (WHEL) Study.

- **Design**: A prospective cohort study design (n = 3085) was used to evaluate the relation between dietary, supplemental, and total vitamin D intake and breast cancer recurrence. A nested case-control study with 512 matched pairs was used for analysis of the association between 25(OH)D and breast cancer recurrence.

- **Results**: No relation between 25(OH)D and breast cancer recurrence was observed. Compared with women with serum concentrations of 25(OH)D ≥ 30 ng/mL, adjusted odds ratios (95% CI) for breast cancer recurrence were 1.14 (0.57, 2.31) for those with concentrations < 10 ng/mL, 1.00 (0.68–1.48) for concentrations ≥ 10 and < 20 ng/mL, and 1.05 (0.76, 1.47) for concentrations ≥ 20 and < 30 ng/mL. No significant associations were observed when analyses were stratified by pre- and postmenopausal status or for local, regional, or distant recurrence or death. Vitamin D intake was not related to breast cancer recurrence overall, although for premenopausal women there was a significant inverse association between dietary vitamin D intake and recurrence (P for trend = 0.02).

- **Conclusion**: These results do not provide support for a relation between concentration of vitamin D and breast cancer recurrence.

### Cancer and vitamin D supplementation: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^11231SgD]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2018). Low credibility.

Low 25-hydroxyvitamin D status has been associated with a higher risk of cancer in epidemiologic studies.

- **Objective**: The aim of this study was to undertake a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) investigating the effect of vitamin D supplementation alone on cancer incidence and mortality.

- **Design**: A systematic review was undertaken. MEDLINE, Embase, CENTRAL, conference abstracts, and clinical trial registries were searched (last search March 2017) for RCTs investigating vitamin D supplementation alone. RCTs with ≥ 12 months of follow-up and in participants with a mean or median age ≥ 60 years were eligible. During-study events were used as the main analysis, but after-study events were included in a secondary analysis. Subgroup analyses concerning different forms of vitamin D supplementation, 25-hydroxyvitamin D status at baseline, vitamin D dose, and exclusion of open-label trials were undertaken.

- **Results**: Thirty studies including 18,808 participants were included in the systematic review, with a median follow-up ranging from 1 to 6.2 years. The results of the meta-analysis for during-study events showed no evidence of an effect of vitamin D supplementation for cancer incidence (RR: 1.03; 95% CI: 0.91, 1.15) and cancer-related deaths (RR: 0.88; 95% CI: 0.70, 1.09). Including after-study events, the RRs were 1.02 (95% CI: 0.92, 1.13) and 0.86 (95% CI: 0.72, 1.03), respectively. These results did not appear to be affected by baseline 25-hydroxyvitamin D status, vitamin D dose, or the exclusion of open-label trials.

- **Conclusion**: We did not find evidence of a significant effect of vitamin D supplementation on cancer incidence or mortality.

### Vitamin D deficiency is correlated with poor outcomes in patients with luminal-type breast cancer [^113v67qn]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2011). Low credibility.

We have shown that deficient serum concentrations of vitamin D were significantly associated with an increased risk of distant recurrence of breast cancer compared with patients who had adequate levels of vitamin D. Furthermore, the prognostic association varied with intrinsic subtype, being significant only for patients with luminal types of breast cancer. To the best of our knowledge, the present study is the first to show that vitamin D concentration is a valuable prognostic indicator in estimation of survival, depending on breast cancer intrinsic subtype.

Although several epidemiologic studies have evaluated associations between vitamin D concentration, breast cancer risk, and prognosis, the cited works have yielded inconsistent results. Among methodologic inconsistencies evident in these studies are evaluation of vitamin D status; some works assessed the effects of dietary or supplemental intake of vitamin D, and others explored vitamin D status with respect to sunlight exposure. Measurement of circulating concentrations of 25-OHD provides an integrated measure of vitamin D derived from all sources, including sunlight exposure, diet, and supplementation, and is considered the best indicator of vitamin D body stores. The cited epidemiologic studies also used different categorizations of vitamin D status, and one work, similar to the present report, categorized vitamin D status by serum 25-OHD concentration as deficient, insufficient, and sufficient.

Several epidemiologic studies have shown conflicting results between vitamin D and hormone receptor-defined breast cancer.

### The effect of vitamin D supplementation on risk of keratinocyte cancer: an exploratory analysis of the D-Health randomized controlled trial [^115K5wYw]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2022). High credibility.

Vitamin D may play a role in the prevention of keratinocyte cancer (KC), but observational studies examining the association between serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D concentration and KC are largely uninformative because sun exposure causes both KC and vitamin D production. There is scant evidence from clinical trials of supplementary vitamin D.

- **Objectives**: To examine the effect of vitamin D supplementation on the risk of developing KC.

- **Methods**: We used data from the D-Health Trial, a randomized placebo-controlled trial of vitamin D supplementation (60,000 international units monthly for 5 years) among Australians aged ≥ 60 years. KC outcomes were captured through linkage to a national administrative dataset for those who consented (N = 20,334; 95%). We used negative binomial regression to analyze the incidence of KC excisions and the incidence of actinic lesions treated using cryotherapy or serial curettage, and flexible parametric survival models for analysis of time to first KC excision.

- **Results**: Randomization to vitamin D supplementation did not reduce the incidence of KC lesions treated by excision [incidence rate ratio (IRR) 1.04; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.98–1.11], the incidence of actinic lesions treated using other methods (IRR 1.01; 95% CI 0.95–1.08), or time to first histologically confirmed KC excision (hazard ratio 1.02; 95% CI 0.97–1.08). However, in subgroup analysis, vitamin D increased the incidence of KC excisions in adults aged ≥ 70 years (IRR 1.13, 95% CI 1.04–1.23; P-value for interaction = 0.01).

- **Conclusions**: Vitamin D supplementation did not reduce the incidence of keratinocyte cancer lesions.

### Review: The impacts of circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels on cancer patient outcomes: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115fFbNL]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2014). Low credibility.

Circulating levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] may affect the prognosis of cancer patients; however, the epidemiological results are not consistent.

- **Objective**: To perform a meta-analysis of all published studies to assess the associations of circulating 25(OH)D levels measured at or near the time of diagnosis and outcomes for cancer patients.

- **Data sources**: Searches of the PubMed and MEDLINE databases were performed and updated to December 2013.

- **Study selection**: Studies reporting an association between circulating 25(OH)D levels at or near the time of diagnosis and outcomes for the patients were included.

- **Data extraction**: Data extraction was performed independently by two authors, and conflicts were resolved by a third investigator.

- **Data synthesis**: Included in the meta-analysis were 25 studies with 17,332 cases. Significant associations between circulating 25(OH)D levels at or near the time of diagnosis and the outcomes for cancer patients were found. The pooled hazard ratio for the highest vs. the lowest quartile of circulating 25(OH)D levels was 0.55 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.33–0.91) for the overall survival of colorectal cancer patients, 0.63 (95% CI = 0.51–0.77) for breast cancer patients, and 0.48 (95% CI = 0.36–0.64) for lymphoma patients. Higher 25(OH)D levels were significantly associated with reduced cancer-specific mortality for patients with colorectal cancer (P = 0.005) and lymphoma (P < .001) and improved disease-free survival for patients with breast cancer (P < .001) or lymphoma (P < .05).

### Monthly high-dose vitamin D supplementation and cancer risk: A post hoc analysis of the Vitamin D Assessment randomized clinical trial [^117Prmbk]. JAMA Oncology (2018). Low credibility.

The importance of this study arises from the previous inconsistent results reported by randomized clinical trials regarding the effect of vitamin D supplementation on cancer incidence. This study aims to examine whether high-dose vitamin D supplementation, administered monthly without calcium, is associated with a reduction in cancer incidence and mortality in the general population.

The design, setting, and participants of this research involved a post hoc analysis of data from the Vitamin D Assessment (ViDA) study. This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that recruited participants from family practices and community groups in Auckland, New Zealand, from April 5, 2011, through November 6, 2012. Follow-up was completed on December 31, 2015. The participants were adult community residents aged 50 to 84 years. Out of 47,905 adults invited from family practices and 163 from community groups, 5,110 participants were randomized to receive vitamin D3 (n = 2,558) or placebo (n = 2,552). Two participants withdrew consent, but all others (n = 5,108) were included in the primary analysis. Data analysis was conducted by intention to treat.

- **Interventions**: The trial involved oral administration of vitamin D3, starting with an initial bolus dose of 200,000 IU, followed by monthly doses of 100,000 IU, or a placebo, for a median duration of 3.3 years (ranging from 2.5 to 4.2 years).

- **Main outcomes and measures**: The post hoc primary outcome assessed was the number of all primary invasive and in situ malignant neoplasms (excluding nonmelanoma skin cancers) diagnosed from randomization until the discontinuation of study medication on July 31, 2015.

- **Results**: Among the 5,108 participants included in the analysis, the mean (SD) age was 65.9 (8.3) years.

### Vitamin D with or without calcium supplementation for prevention of cancer and fractures: An updated meta-analysis for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force [^115DCagW]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2011). High credibility.

Studies suggest that vitamin D supplementation may reduce cancer and fracture risks.

- **Purpose**: To examine the benefits and harms of vitamin D with or without calcium supplementation on clinical outcomes of cancer and fractures in adults.

- **Data sources**: English-language studies identified from MEDLINE and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials through July 2011.

- **Study selection**: Randomized, controlled trials (RCTs), prospective cohort studies, and nested case-control studies reporting incidence of or death from cancer and fracture outcomes.

- **Data extraction**: Multiple reviewers extracted details about participant characteristics, including baseline vitamin D status and use of supplements; details of statistical analyses, including adjustments for confounding; and methodological quality. Differences were resolved by consensus.

- **Data synthesis**: Nineteen RCTs (three for cancer and sixteen for fracture outcomes) and 28 observational studies (for cancer outcomes) were analyzed. Limited data from RCTs suggested that high-dose (1000 IU/d) vitamin D supplementation can reduce the risk for total cancer. Additionally, data from observational studies suggested that higher blood 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-[OH]D) concentrations might be associated with increased risk for cancer. Mixed-effects dose-response meta-analyses showed that each 10-nmol/L increase in blood 25-(OH)D concentration was associated with a 6% (95% CI, 3% to 9%) reduced risk for colorectal cancer but no statistically significant dose-response relationships for prostate and breast cancer.

### Intake of vitamin D and calcium, sun exposure, and risk of breast cancer subtypes among black women [^114g4n7u]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2020). Low credibility.

Because vitamin D is the precursor to the steroid hormone calcitriol, several specific mechanisms in regulating ER+ development have been proposed. These include inhibiting estrogen synthesis in breast cancer cells or surrounding adipose tissue, and downregulating ER in breast cancer cells to inhibit estrogen signaling. Vitamin D may also play a role in the pathways against more aggressive breast cancer subtypes. In addition to ER+ cells, vitamin D receptors (VDRs) are also present in ER− cells, including two-thirds of TNBC. Acting on VDRs, vitamin D compounds could trigger growth arrest and apoptosis via estrogen-independent mechanisms and inhibit the expression of several myoepithelial markers associated with more aggressive breast cancers.

Black women are more likely to develop ER− and TNBC than white women, but few studies have investigated the role of vitamin D on the risk of breast cancer subtypes among them. In the BWHS, dietary vitamin D or calcium intake was not associated with the risk of ER+ or ER− disease, which is consistent with our observations. Supplemental vitamin D intake and sun exposure were not evaluated. To our knowledge, only one study has evaluated vitamin D status (serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 concentration) in relation to TNBC among black women, finding a significant inverse association, which supports our observations. However, these findings need to be interpreted with caution because blood samples in the previous study were collected at the time of diagnosis, and more studies among this minority group are needed.

We recognize the potential of recall bias.

### Plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration and subsequent risk of total and site-specific cancers in Japanese population: Large case-cohort study within Japan Public Health Center-based prospective study cohort [^11763mM1]. BMJ (2018). Low credibility.

A major strength of this prospective study is its measurement of plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration in a large number of participants. The use of pre-diagnostic plasma samples and long follow-up reduced the possibility of reverse causation. The non-selective inclusion of all incident cases of cancer diagnosed during the study period eliminated concerns about survival bias and selection bias. Because the subcohort populations are representative subsamples of the original cohorts, the findings are expected to be generalizable to the source population without the need to measure biomarkers in the entire cohort. Also, the choice of a case-cohort design allowed us to evaluate multiple cancer endpoints simultaneously while using the common subcohort sample.

Measurement of 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration was conducted in a single plasma sample collected at one point in time, and might not closely represent the long-term circulating range. However, one study reported an intra-class correlation coefficient of 0.71 (95% confidence interval 0.63 to 0.88) in 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations across serum samples collected at three time points over a five-year period. In addition, the median 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations in plasma samples collected at three different time points up to 20 years apart and stored for 10, 20, and 30 years were similar. Moreover, if this misclassification of exposure did occur, then it would be non-differential to both cases and subcohorts and would probably bias the results towards null.

### Vitamin D supplementation during neoadjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer improves pathological complete response: A prospective randomized clinical trial [^113TWC6X]. World Journal of Surgery (2025). High credibility.

- **Patients and methods**: Female patients with primary breast cancer, aged 18 years and older, who received neoadjuvant systemic therapy (NST) between June 2019 and June 2023 at İstanbul Florence Nightingale Hospital, and whose vitamin D levels were analyzed before and after NST, were included in the study. Patients who consented to participate and continued their follow-up from the initiation of NST to the final surgery were randomized into the study group (vitamin D intake, n = 114) and the control group (no vitamin D intake, n = 113) on a 1:1 basis. The primary surgeon generated the random allocation sequence, enrolled participants, and assigned them to interventions. Patients with comorbidities that could directly or indirectly affect serum vitamin D levels, pregnant or lactating patients, and patients over 80 years of age were excluded from the study. Patient records were collected and analyzed prospectively.

An oral form of 50,000 IU vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) replacement was administered once a week during chemotherapy for the study cohort. Serum vitamin D levels, expressed as 25‐hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D), were analyzed before the initiation and after the final dose of NST at the same institution using routinely calibrated equipment. Vitamin D levels were categorized according to the Institute of Medicine (IOM) guidelines as deficient (< 20 ng/mL), insufficient (≥ 20 – < 30 ng/mL), normal (≥ 30 – < 100 ng/mL), and hypervitaminosis (≥ 100 ng/mL).

### Plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration and subsequent risk of total and site specific cancers in Japanese population: Large case-cohort study within Japan Public Health Center-based Prospective Study cohort [^114JNiNF]. BMJ (2018). High credibility.

- **Comparison with other studies**: Only a few studies have evaluated the association between circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration and the risk of total cancer. In the Copenhagen City Heart Study, which included more than 2,400 cancer events identified during a follow-up of up to 28 years, a 50% decrease in 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration was associated with a modest 6% increase in the risk of total cancer. In this study, however, the risks for tobacco-related cancers were stronger than those for overall cancer (hazard ratio for a 50% decrease in 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration of 1.20, 95% confidence interval 1.13 to 1.28).

In contrast, no overall association between 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration and any cancer risk was seen in other individual studies from the US, Denmark, Germany, and Norway, although the German study showed a suggestive increase in risk with low 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration among men and other subgroups only. These studies had relatively small numbers of cancer cases, however, and the participants were relatively older. In the Health Professionals Follow-up Study, an increment in predicted 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration by 25 nmol/L was associated with a 17% reduction in total cancer incidence. A recent meta-analysis of the above studies suggested an 11% reduction in overall cancer incidence associated with a 50 nmol/L increase in 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration. The corresponding risk estimates (8% and 16% reduction per 25 nmol/L and 50 nmol/L increase in 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration) in our study (supplementary methods) was weaker than the estimates from the meta-analysis.

### Interaction between current vitamin D supplementation and menopausal hormone therapy use on breast cancer risk: Evidence from the E3N cohort [^116jxb7W]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2015). Low credibility.

Experimental studies suggest protective effects of vitamin D on breast carcinogenesis, particularly on estrogen receptor-positive tumors; however, epidemiologic data are less conclusive.

- **Objective**: Our objective was to investigate the association between postmenopausal breast cancer risk and past vitamin D supplementation overall and according to the use of menopausal hormone therapy (MHT).

- **Design**: Between 1995 and 2008, 2,482 invasive breast cancer cases were diagnosed among 57,403 postmenopausal women from the E3N prospective cohort during 581,085 person-years. Vitamin D supplementation was assessed from biennially self-administered questionnaires sent in 1995, 2000, 2002, and 2005, and from medico-administrative data on drug reimbursements since 2004. Multivariable hazard ratios (HRs) for primary invasive breast cancer and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using Cox models.

- **Results**: A decreased postmenopausal breast cancer risk was associated with current vitamin D supplementation (HR: 0.82; 95% CI: 0.69, 0.97), but not with past supplementation (HR: 1.10; 95% CI: 0.92, 1.31) [P-homogeneity = 0.02]. The association with vitamin D supplementation differed according to MHT use: ever-users (HR: 0.74; 95% CI: 0.60, 0.90) and never-users (HR: 1.13; 95% CI: 0.89, 1.56) [P-homogeneity = 0.02].

- **Conclusions**: In this observational study, vitamin D supplementation, mostly taken daily and combined with calcium, was associated with a decreased postmenopausal breast cancer risk in MHT users. These findings should be confirmed before considering vitamin D supplementation to partly balance the MHT-associated risks.

### Vitamin D supplementation for prevention of cancer in adults [^116VfQDV]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

The evidence on whether vitamin D supplementation is effective in decreasing cancers is contradictory.

- **Objectives**: To assess the beneficial and harmful effects of vitamin D supplementation for prevention of cancer in adults.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, Science Citation Index Expanded, and the Conference Proceedings Citation Index-Science up to February 2014. We scanned bibliographies of relevant publications and asked experts and pharmaceutical companies for additional trials.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized trials that compared vitamin D at any dose, duration, and route of administration versus placebo or no intervention in adults who were healthy or were recruited among the general population, or diagnosed with a specific disease. Vitamin D could have been administered as supplemental vitamin D (vitamin D₃ (cholecalciferol) or vitamin D₂ (ergocalciferol)), or an active form of vitamin D (1α-hydroxyvitamin D (alfacalcidol), or 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (calcitriol)).

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors extracted data independently. We conducted random-effects and fixed-effect model meta-analyses. For dichotomous outcomes, we calculated the risk ratios (RRs). We considered the risk of bias to assess the risk of systematic errors. We conducted trial sequential analyses to assess the risk of random errors.

- **Main results**: Eighteen randomized trials with 50,623 participants provided data for the analyses. All trials came from high-income countries.

### Vitamin D deficiency is correlated with poor outcomes in patients with luminal-type breast cancer [^111izhDK]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2011). Low credibility.

Vitamin D deficiency may be an indicator of poor prognosis in patients with breast cancer before surgery. This study investigated the association between serum vitamin D concentration and breast cancer prognosis according to intrinsic cancer subtypes.

From June to December 2006, serum 25-OHD was measured in 310 Korean women with breast cancer who were treated at the Asan Medical Center, Korea. Clinicopathologic data were examined to determine the prognostic effects of serum 25-OHD. Expression of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (Her2) was measured using tissue microarrays. Patients were classified with luminal A, luminal B, Her2-enriched, or basal-like subtypes of breast cancer.

The mean patient age was 48.7 years, and the mean serum 25-OHD concentration was 31.4 ± 16.1 ng/ml. The 25-OHD levels were deficient (< 20 ng/ml) in 75 patients (24.2%), insufficient (20–29 ng/ml) in 95 (30.6%), and sufficient (30–150 ng/ml) in 140 (45.2%). Women with deficient 25-OHD levels were at increased risk of recurrence compared with those with sufficient vitamin D levels (P = 0.002). The 25-OHD concentration was inversely associated with the prognosis of patients with cancer of the luminal A (P = 0.012) and luminal B subtypes (P = 0.023), but not with the prognosis of patients with Her2/neu-enriched (P = 0.245) or triple-negative (P = 0.879) cancer subtypes. This association remained valid after adjustment for age, tumor size, nodal status, and estrogen receptor status (hazards ratio = 3.97; 95% confidence interval = 1.77–9).

### Plasma folate, vitamin B-6, vitamin B-12, and risk of breast cancer in women [^116yyH9j]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2008). Low credibility.

B vitamins such as folate, vitamin B-6, and vitamin B-12 are coenzymes important for DNA integrity and stability. Deficiency in these B vitamins may promote tumor carcinogenesis.

- **Objective**: We prospectively evaluated plasma concentrations of folate, pyridoxal 5-phosphate (PLP; the principal active form of vitamin B-6), and vitamin B-12 in relation to breast cancer risk.

- **Design**: We included 848 incident cases of invasive breast cancer identified as of March 31, 2004, and 848 individually matched control subjects from 28,345 women in the Women's Health Study aged ≥ 45 years who provided blood samples and had no history of cancer and cardiovascular disease at baseline in 1993. Logistic regression controlling for matching factors and other risk factors for breast cancer was used to estimate relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). All statistical tests were two-sided.

- **Results**: Plasma concentrations of folate, PLP, and vitamin B-12 were not associated with overall risk of breast cancer. Women in the highest quintile group relative to those in the lowest quintile had multivariate RRs of 1.42 (95% CI: 1.00, 2.02) for plasma folate (P for trend = 0.21), 0.91 (95% CI: 0.63, 1.30) for plasma PLP (P for trend = 0.48), and 1.29 (95% CI: 0.92, 1.82) for plasma vitamin B-12 (P for trend = 0.18). However, higher plasma folate concentrations were moderately associated with an increased risk of developing premenopausal breast cancer (P for trend = 0.04) and for developing estrogen receptor (ER)-positive or progesterone receptor (PR)-positive breast tumors.

### Plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration and subsequent risk of total and site specific cancers in Japanese population: Large case-cohort study within Japan public health center-based prospective study cohort [^115PnbjK]. BMJ (2018). Low credibility.

A meta-analysis that included 11,941 cases and 13,870 controls from 21 studies reported a significant 17% elevated risk of prostate cancer in participants with higher 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration compared with those with low 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration (odds ratio 1.17, 95% confidence interval 1.05 to 1.30; P = 0.004). This meta-analysis did not include subgroup analysis by grade or stage of prostate cancer, but some studies have suggested that the association between 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration and prostate cancer may differ by disease type. For example, although no clear association was observed with overall prostate cancer, significant decreases in the risk of lethal prostate cancer and high-grade (Gleason 8–10) prostate cancer associated with higher 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration were seen in two studies. One other study also reported a possible U-shaped relation of plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration with total prostate cancer, which was more evident for high-grade (Gleason 7–10) prostate cancers. In our study, however, the hazard ratios associated with higher vitamin D concentration showed no clear association for either localized or advanced prostate cancers.

Although prospective studies of breast cancer have not provided consistent evidence for an association with circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D, some studies have suggested that the association may differ by menopausal status. A dose-response meta-analysis (5,206 cases and 6,450 controls) of plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations suggested no association for premenopausal women but a non-linear association in postmenopausal women was indicated.

### Vitamin D for the prevention of disease: An Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^117GUmKc]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for vitamin D deficiency, particularly concerning empiric supplementation, the ES 2024 guidelines recommend considering offering empiric vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy. This approach may potentially lower the risks of preeclampsia, intrauterine mortality, preterm birth, small-for-gestational-age birth, and neonatal mortality.

### Circulating vitamin C concentration and risk of cancers: a Mendelian randomization study [^115pb4w2]. BMC Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Summary-level data for the association between genetic variants and five site-specific cancer outcomes (i.e. lung (including bronchus), prostate, breast, colon, and rectal cancer) were retrieved by running the GWAS for each cancer in the UK Biobank using the newly developed fastGWA-glmm tool. The UK Biobank is a cohort study of about half a million adults (aged 40–69 years at baseline) recruited between 2006 and 2010. In the analyses, we included 456,348 UK Biobank participants.

To replicate our findings on the associations between the vitamin C-related SNPs and cancers in the UK Biobank dataset, publicly available summary-level data for lung, prostate, and breast cancer were obtained from the International Lung Cancer Consortium (ILCCO), the Prostate Cancer Association Group to Investigate Cancer Associated Alterations in the Genome (PRACTICAL) Consortium, and the Breast Cancer Association Consortium (BCAC), respectively. Briefly, the ILCCO was established in 2004, with the goal of sharing compatible data from lung cancer epidemiology studies around the world to maximize statistical power. We acquired summary data from the ILCCO using the MR-Base database, involving 27,209 participants of European ancestry (15,861 controls and 11,348 cases, including 3,442 lung adenocarcinoma and 3,275 lung squamous cell carcinoma). The PRACTICAL and BCAC consortia aimed to identify genes related to the risk of prostate and breast cancer, respectively, by combining data from many studies. We retrieved publicly available summary-level data of 140,254 participants of European ancestry.

### Intake of vitamin D and calcium, sun exposure, and risk of breast cancer subtypes among black women [^116UAna3]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2020). Low credibility.

We observed strong inverse associations between daylight hours spent outdoors and the risk of all breast cancer subtypes. This observation aligns with previous ecological studies, which repeatedly found an inverse correlation between UV exposure and breast cancer risk in the United States. Prospective investigations conducted in the United States also found that increased sunlight exposure was associated with a reduced risk of breast cancer. These studies were conducted among primarily white women, who can be more efficient at producing vitamin D owing to light skin pigmentation. They reported similar or less time spent outside in daylight compared with the black women enrolled in our study. Studies conducted among European women living at high latitudes did not observe such associations, suggesting that the vitamin D concentrations necessary to reduce breast cancer risk may be difficult to achieve through skin synthesis in regions with low solar radiance.

We found similar results for sunlight exposure in summer and other seasons combined. This could be explained by errors in reporting (some women may not accurately separate exposure in summer from other seasons) or the storage of vitamin D in adipose tissue, which potentially extends its effects accumulated through summer to other seasons. A low amount of sun exposure may also be a reflection of disrupted daily (circadian) rhythms, which may induce breast carcinogenesis via altering endocrine timing. However, excluding women who had shift work did not change our results. Physical activity was considered to be a confounding factor.

### Circulating vitamin D concentration and risk of seven cancers: Mendelian randomisation study [^116qCZ25]. BMJ (2017). Low credibility.

In summary, using a comprehensive Mendelian randomisation study, we found little evidence for linear causal associations between genetic determinants of circulating vitamin D concentration and the risk of colorectal, breast, prostate, ovarian, lung, and pancreatic cancer, as well as neuroblastoma. However, we cannot rule out the existence of causal clinically relevant effects of low magnitude. Our results, in combination with previous literature, provide evidence that population-wide screening for vitamin D deficiency and subsequent widespread vitamin D supplementation should not currently be recommended as a strategy for primary cancer prevention.

### Intake of vitamin D and calcium, sun exposure, and risk of breast cancer subtypes among black women [^115Rw8MY]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2020). Low credibility.

The randomized placebo-controlled Vitamin D and Omega-3 Trial suggested a possible benefit of vitamin D on cancer incidence among black individuals. However, data are limited regarding the impact of vitamin D on breast cancer subtypes among African-American/black women, who tend to develop more aggressive forms of breast cancer.

- **Objectives**: We hypothesize that more vitamin D exposure through diet, supplements, and sunlight, along with higher intake of calcium, are associated with decreased risk of estrogen receptor (ER)+ and ER− breast cancer, as well as triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) among black women.

- **Methods**: This study was conducted among 1,724 black cases and 1,233 controls in the Women's Circle of Health Study (WCHS) and WCHS2. Polytomous logistic regressions were used to estimate ORs and 95% CIs of ER+ and ER− breast cancer, while logistic regressions were applied for TNBC. The ORs from each study were pooled using an inverse-variance-weighted random-effects model.

- **Results**: Dietary vitamin D and calcium intake were not associated with risk of breast cancer subtypes in the pooled analysis. For supplemental vitamin D, we observed possible inverse associations between intake of ≤ 800 IU/d (compared with nonuse) and risk of several subtypes, with effects that appeared strongest for TNBC (OR: 0.58; 95% CI: 0.35, 0.94). No association was found for > 800 IU/d. More daylight hours spent outdoors in a year was associated with lower risk of ER+, ER−, and TNBC (e.g. highest compared with lowest quartile: TNBC OR: 0.53; 95% CI: 0.31, 0.91; P-trend = 0.02).

In conclusion, while specific intake levels and outdoor exposure correlate differently, fundamental patterns suggest sunlight exposure and certain levels of supplementation may influence breast cancer subtype risks in the studied demographic.

### Prospective study of serum vitamin D and cancer mortality in the United States [^116gBcS9]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2007). Low credibility.

Vitamin D has been hypothesized to reduce cancer mortality through its effects on incidence and/or survival. Epidemiologic studies of the association of 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] and the risk of cancer, however, have been largely limited to incident cancers at a few sites.

- **Methods**: A total of 16,818 participants in the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey who were 17 years or older at enrollment were followed from 1988–1994 through 2000. Levels of serum 25(OH)D were measured at baseline by radioimmunoassay. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to examine the relationship between serum 25(OH)D levels and total cancer mortality (in the entire population or according to race/ethnicity, sex, age, and retinol status) and mortality from specific cancers. Because serum was collected in the south in cooler months and the north in warmer months, we examined associations by collection season. All statistical tests were two-sided.

- **Results**: We identified 536 cancer deaths in 146,578 person-years. Total cancer mortality was unrelated to baseline vitamin D status in the entire population, men, women, non-Hispanic whites, non-Hispanic blacks, Mexican Americans, and in persons younger than 70 or 70 years or older. We found no interaction between vitamin D and season or vitamin D and serum retinol. Colorectal cancer mortality was inversely related to serum 25(OH)D level, with levels 80 nmol/L or higher associated with a 72% risk reduction (95% confidence interval = 32% to 89%) compared with lower than 50 nmol/L, P(trend) = .02.

- **Conclusion**: The study underscores the complexity of the relationship between vitamin D and cancer mortality, suggesting that while general cancer mortality may not be influenced by vitamin D levels, specific cancers such as colorectal cancer could have different outcomes depending on serum 25(OH)D levels.

### Association between circulating vitamin E and ten common cancers: Evidence from large-scale Mendelian randomization analysis and a longitudinal cohort study [^1116A4TK]. BMC Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

The association between vitamin E and cancer risk has been widely investigated by observational studies, but the findings remain inconclusive. Here, we aimed to evaluate the causal effect of circulating vitamin E on the risk of ten common cancers, including bladder, breast, colorectal, esophagus, lung, oral and pharynx, ovarian, pancreatic, prostate, and kidney cancer.

- **Methods**: A Mendelian randomization (MR) analytic framework was applied from a cancer-specific genome-wide association study (GWAS) comprising a total of 297,699 cancer cases and 304,736 controls of European ancestry. Three genetic instrumental variables associated with circulating vitamin E were selected. Summary statistic-based methods of inverse variance weighting (IVW) and a likelihood-based approach, as well as the individual genotyping-based method of genetic risk score (GRS), were used. Multivariable IVW analysis was further performed to control for potential confounding effects. Furthermore, the UK Biobank cohort was used as external validation, supporting 355,543 European participants (incident cases ranged from 437 for ovarian cancer to 4882 for prostate cancer) for GRS-based estimation of circulating vitamin E, accompanied by a one-sample MR analysis of dietary vitamin E intake underlying the time-to-event analytic framework.

- **Results**: Specific to cancer GWAS, we found that circulating vitamin E was significantly associated with increased bladder cancer risk (odds ratios [OR] IVW = 6.23, P IVW = 3.05×10⁻³) but decreased breast cancer risk (OR IVW = 0.68, P IVW = 8.19×10⁻³).

### Circulating vitamin D concentration and risk of seven cancers: Mendelian randomisation study [^116JuRws]. BMJ (2017). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to determine if circulating concentrations of vitamin D are causally associated with the risk of cancer. The study employed a Mendelian randomisation design and was set in large genetic epidemiology networks, including the Genetic Associations and Mechanisms in Oncology (GAME-ON), the Genetic and Epidemiology of Colorectal Cancer Consortium (GECCO), the Prostate Cancer Association Group to Investigate Cancer Associated Alterations in the Genome (PRACTICAL) consortiums, and the MR-Base platform.

Participants included 70,563 cases of cancer and 84,418 controls. Cancer cases were categorized as follows:

- **Cancer types**:
	- **Prostate cancer**: 22,898 cases
	- **Breast cancer**: 15,748 cases
	- **Lung cancer**: 12,537 cases
	- **Colorectal cancer**: 11,488 cases
	- **Ovarian cancer**: 4,369 cases
	- **Pancreatic cancer**: 1,896 cases
	- **Neuroblastoma**: 1,627 cases

Four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (rs2282679, rs10741657, rs12785878, and rs6013897) associated with vitamin D were used to define a multi-polymorphism score for circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) concentrations.

- **Main outcome measures**:
	- The risk of incident colorectal, breast, prostate, ovarian, lung, pancreatic cancer, and neuroblastoma.
	- Assessment was conducted using an inverse variance-weighted average of the associations with specific polymorphisms and a likelihood-based approach.

- **Secondary outcomes**:
	- Cancer subtypes by sex, anatomic location, stage, and histology.

The results indicated little evidence that the multi-polymorphism score of 25(OH)D was associated with the risk of any of the seven cancers or their subtypes. Specifically, the odds ratios per 25 nmol/L increase in genetically determined 25(OH)D concentrations were 0.92.

### Vitamin D and calcium intakes and breast cancer risk in pre- and postmenopausal women [^115wxK3T]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2010). Low credibility.

Some evidence suggests that vitamin D may reduce breast cancer risk. Despite the biological interaction between vitamin D and calcium, few studies have evaluated their joint effects on breast cancer risk.

- **Objective**: The objective was to evaluate the associations and potential interaction between vitamin D and calcium (from food and supplements) and breast cancer risk in a population-based case-control study.

- **Design**: Breast cancer cases aged 25–74 years (diagnosed 2002–2003) were identified through the Ontario Cancer Registry. Controls were identified by using random digit dialing; 3,101 cases and 3,471 controls completed epidemiologic and food-frequency questionnaires. Adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated by using multivariate logistic regression.

- **Results**: Vitamin D and calcium intakes from food only and total combined intakes (food and supplements) were not associated with breast cancer risk, although the mean intake of vitamin D was low. Vitamin D supplement intake > 10 micrograms/day (400 IU/day) compared with no intake was associated with a reduced risk of breast cancer (adjusted OR: 0.76; 95% CI: 0.59, 0.98). No categories of calcium supplement intake were significantly associated with reduced breast cancer risk, but a significant inverse trend was observed (P = 0.04). There were no significant interactions involving vitamin D, calcium, or menopausal status.

- **Conclusions**: No associations were found between overall vitamin D or calcium intake and breast cancer risk. Vitamin D from supplements was independently associated with reduced breast cancer risk.

### Serum lipids, lipoproteins, and risk of breast cancer: a nested case-control study using multiple time points [^112wdy64]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2015). Low credibility.

There is strong evidence that breast cancer risk is influenced by environmental factors. Blood lipid and lipoprotein levels are also influenced by these factors and are associated with some breast cancer risk factors. We examined whether serial measures of serum lipids and lipoproteins were associated with breast cancer risk.

- **Methods**: We carried out a nested case-control study within a randomized long-term dietary intervention trial with 4,690 women with extensive mammographic density followed for an average of 10 years for breast cancer incidence. We measured lipids in an average of 4.2 blood samples for 279 invasive breast cancer case subjects and 558 matched control subjects. We calculated subaverages of lipids for each subject based on menopausal status and use of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) at blood collection and analyzed their association with breast cancer using generalized estimating equations. All statistical tests were two-sided.

- **Results**: High-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) (P = 0.05) and apoA1 (P = 0.02) levels were positively associated with breast cancer risk (75th vs. 25th percentile: HDL-C, 23% higher; apoA1, 28% higher) and non-HDL-C (P = 0.03) and apoB (P = 0.01) levels were negatively associated (75th vs. 25th percentile: non-HDL-C, 19% lower; apoB, 22% lower). These associations were observed only when lipids were measured when HRT was not used. Total cholesterol and triglyceride levels were not statistically significantly associated with breast cancer risk.

- **Conclusions**: These results demonstrate that serum lipids are related to breast cancer risk when blood samples are collected without the influence of HRT.

### Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels in early and advanced breast cancer [^114iXNVe]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2006). Low credibility.

Laboratory and epidemiological studies have implicated vitamin D deficiency in the pathogenesis of breast cancer. 1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH)₂D) promotes differentiation and apoptosis, and potently inhibits proliferation of malignant breast epithelial cells in culture. Serum levels of 1,25(OH)₂D are higher in normal women than in patients with primary breast cancer.

- **Aim**: To clarify the role of vitamin D in breast cancer progression by comparing the levels of serum vitamin D in patients with early and in those with advanced breast cancer.

- **Methods**: Circulating levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D), parathyroid hormone (PTH), and calcium were measured prospectively in 279 Caucasian women with invasive breast cancer — 204 women with early-stage disease and 75 women with locally advanced or metastatic disease.

- **Results**: Patients with early-stage breast cancer had significantly higher circulating levels of 25(OH)D (p < 0.005) and significantly lower PTH (p < 0.001) levels than those with advanced disease. Calcium levels did not differ significantly (p = 0.74).

- **Conclusion**: Serum levels of 25(OH)D are significantly higher in patients with early-stage breast cancer than in those with locally advanced or metastatic disease.

### Plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration and subsequent risk of total and site-specific cancers in Japanese population: Large case-cohort study within Japan Public Health Center-based Prospective Study cohort [^113Fi9Kd]. BMJ (2018). Low credibility.

**Subgroup and sensitivity analyses**: Subgroup analysis by sex showed no evidence of a significant difference in the effect of vitamin D between sexes (supplementary tables D and E). In sensitivity analyses, exclusion of cases of cancer diagnosed in the first three years of follow-up did not appreciably alter the findings for total cancer (hazard ratio for highest versus lowest quarter 0.81, 0.69 to 0.95; P for trend = 0.005) and liver cancer (0.43, 0.24 to 0.78; P for trend = 0.0045). Likewise, the associations remained unchanged after exclusion of 1836 participants with supplemental vitamin use. Additional adjustment for occupational status in the multivariable model did not largely alter the risk estimates. To test whether the 25-hydroxyvitamin D/total cancer association was driven by associations with any one specific cancer site (in particular by liver, lung, prostate, and breast cancer), we reanalysed the 25-hydroxyvitamin D/total cancer association by alternately excluding cases of these cancers from total cancer cases — that is, one cancer site at a time in separate models. Hazard ratios in each of these models showed no appreciable difference from the overall model, possibly indicating that the total cancer association is the result of the accumulation of small effects shared across multiple sites.

### Circulating vitamin D concentration and risk of seven cancers: Mendelian randomisation study [^113t7XGo]. BMJ (2017). High credibility.

The objective of this study was to determine if circulating concentrations of vitamin D are causally associated with the risk of cancer. This research employed a Mendelian randomisation study design.

- **Setting**:
	- Large genetic epidemiology networks, including the Genetic Associations and Mechanisms in Oncology (GAME-ON), the Genetic and Epidemiology of Colorectal Cancer Consortium (GECCO), the Prostate Cancer Association Group to Investigate Cancer Associated Alterations in the Genome (PRACTICAL) consortiums, and the MR-Base platform, were used.

- **Participants**:
	- The study included 70,563 cases of cancer, distributed as follows:
		- **Prostate cancer**: 22,898
		- **Breast cancer**: 15,748
		- **Lung cancer**: 12,537
		- **Colorectal cancer**: 11,488
		- **Ovarian cancer**: 4,369
		- **Pancreatic cancer**: 1,896
		- **Neuroblastoma**: 1,627
	- **Controls**: 84,418

- **Exposures**:
	- **Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with vitamin D**:
		- rs2282679, rs10741657, rs12785878, rs6013897
	- A multi-polymorphism score for circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations was defined using these SNPs.

- **Main outcomes measures**:
	- **Primary outcomes**:
		- The risk of incident colorectal, breast, prostate, ovarian, lung, pancreatic cancer, and neuroblastoma, evaluated using an inverse variance weighted average of the associations with specific polymorphisms and a likelihood-based approach.
	- **Secondary outcomes**:
		- Based on cancer subtypes, categorized by sex, anatomic location, stage, and histology.

Results showed little evidence that the multi-polymorphism score of 25(OH)D was associated with any significant risk of the seven types of cancer or their subtypes. Specifically, no significant association was identified with odds ratios per 25 nmol/L increase in genetically determined 25(OH)D concentrations.

### Skeletal and extraskeletal actions of Vitamin D: Current evidence and outstanding questions [^111Cw8FU]. Endocrine Reviews (2019). Low credibility.

The real answer, however, about a causal role of Vitamin D status on cancer has to come from RCTs. Only a few studies have so far addressed this question. Nine of ten such RCTs did not demonstrate a clear benefit of Vitamin D supplementation (400 to 2000 IU/d for up to 8 years of follow-up). The large Women's Health Initiative trial did not demonstrate a beneficial effect of combined Vitamin D (400 IU/d) and calcium supplementation on cancer in general or on colorectal cancer. Two subsequent studies of the Women's Health Initiative data, either excluding women who took calcium or Vitamin D supplementation at baseline or excluding women who took hormone replacement therapy during the study, revealed a better effect of Vitamin D and calcium supplementation on colorectal cancer. Albeit, this was still a nonsignificant decrease with RR, 0.81 (0.58 to 1.13; not significant) and RR, 0.71 (0.46 to 1.09), respectively, of the risk of colorectal cancer.

Excluding women on hormone replacement therapy revealed that Vitamin D and calcium supplementation modestly but significantly decreased the risk of breast cancer or all invasive cancers. Trivedi et al. randomly treated 2,686 elderly individuals (2,037 men and 649 women, aged 65 to 85 years) with 100,000 IU of Vitamin D every 4 months or placebo for 5 years and found no differences in cancer incidence or mortality. Another extensive study dealing with colon adenoma and colon cancer did not reveal a beneficial effect of daily 1,000 IU of Vitamin D supplementation during 3 to 5 years, even in a high-risk population.

### Circulating vitamin D concentration and risk of seven cancers: Mendelian randomisation study [^116zJC21]. BMJ (2017). Low credibility.

Evidence from in vitro and animal model studies supports an anti-neoplastic role of vitamin D. Vitamin D functions by activating the nuclear vitamin D receptor, which is ubiquitously expressed and regulates the growth, differentiation, and apoptosis of normal and tumor cells.

Epidemiological studies of circulating vitamin D concentrations and the risk of various cancers have produced inconsistent results. Meta-analyses of observational studies have suggested that higher concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D), the primary circulating form, are associated with a lower risk of colorectal cancer. Epidemiological evidence for breast and prostate cancer is inconclusive, while data for other cancers are limited. Previous observational associations between circulating 25(OH)D and cancer are limited by relatively small study-specific sample sizes (for example, 3,000–5,000 cases in meta-analyses of breast, prostate, and colorectal cancer) and by several potential methodological issues. Specifically, reverse causation could exist if 25(OH)D is measured at or close to cancer diagnosis, residual confounding might be present due to inadequate control for common causes of cancer, and errors in the measurement of exposure to 25(OH)D could result from single measurements.

Definitive data from randomized controlled trials are lacking, as few adequately powered trials have examined vitamin D supplementation and risk of cancer. The Women's Health Initiative, a randomized placebo-controlled trial of 400 IU of vitamin D plus 1,000 mg of calcium per day in 36,282 postmenopausal women, provides limited definitive data.

### Intake of vitamin D and calcium, sun exposure, and risk of breast cancer subtypes among black women [^11459V7P]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2020). Low credibility.

Distributions of key characteristics of cases and controls in the WCHS and WCHS2 are shown in Table 1. For both studies combined, we had 1213 ER+, 511 ER−, and 335 TNBC cases. Cases were less likely to have attended college and more likely to have a history of benign breast disease and a family history of breast cancer than controls. Cases in the WCHS were also older and less likely to be smokers.

Results for age- and multivariable-adjusted models assessing vitamin D and calcium intakes in relation to breast cancer subtypes in individual cohorts are presented in Table 2. Results remained essentially unchanged with multivariable adjustment. Dietary vitamin D intake was not associated with the risk of subtypes in either study. Supplemental vitamin D intake of ≤ 800 IU/d compared with nonusers was associated with a significantly decreased risk of ER+ (OR: 0.68; 95% CI: 0.50, 0.94) and TNBC (OR: 0.58; 95% CI: 0.35, 0.94), but intake of > 800 IU/d (median: 1800 and 1500 IU/d in cases and controls, respectively) was not. There were no clear associations for calcium intake after multivariable adjustment in both studies. We did not observe significant associations for dietary vitamin D or calcium intake from the pooled analysis.

### Intake of dairy products, calcium, and vitamin d and risk of breast cancer [^112ZXYNS]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2002). Low credibility.

Laboratory data suggest that calcium and vitamin D, found at high levels in dairy products, might reduce breast carcinogenesis. However, epidemiologic studies regarding dairy products and breast cancer have yielded inconsistent results. We examined data from a large, long-term cohort study to evaluate whether high intake of dairy products, calcium, or vitamin D is associated with reduced risk of breast cancer.

- **Methods**: We followed 88,691 women in the Nurses' Health Study cohort from the date of return of their food-frequency questionnaire in 1980 until May 31, 1996. Dietary information was collected in 1980 and updated in 1984, 1986, 1990, and 1994. We identified 3,482 women (premenopausal = 827, postmenopausal = 2,345, and uncertain menopausal status = 310) with incident invasive breast cancer. We used pooled logistic regression to estimate multivariable relative risks (RRs) using 2-year time increments. The RRs and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for each category of intake compared with the lowest intake group. All statistical tests were two-sided.

- **Results**: Intakes of dairy products, calcium, or vitamin D were not statistically significantly associated with breast cancer risk in postmenopausal women. In premenopausal women, however, consumption of dairy products, especially of low-fat dairy foods and skim/low-fat milk, was inversely associated with risk of breast cancer. The multivariable RRs comparing highest (> 1 serving/day) and lowest (≤ 3 servings/month) intake categories were 0.68 (95% CI = 0.55 to 0.86) for low-fat dairy foods and 0.72.

### Vitamin C supplement intake and postmenopausal breast cancer risk: Interaction with dietary vitamin C [^116rRhRU]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2016). Low credibility.

Experimental and epidemiologic studies have yielded conflicting results on the relation between vitamin C intake and breast cancer risk.

- **Objective**: We investigated the relation between vitamin C supplement intake and breast cancer risk while considering dietary vitamin C intake.

- **Design**: Between 1995 and 2008, 2,482 invasive breast cancer cases occurred in 57,403 postmenopausal women from the Etude Epidémiologique auprès de femmes de la Mutuelle Générale de l'Education Nationale (E3N) prospective cohort during 581,085 person-years. We estimated vitamin C intake from foods using a validated food-frequency questionnaire sent to subjects in 1993–1995 and assessed vitamin C supplement use via questionnaires sent in 1995, 2000, 2002, and 2005. Multivariable HRs (95% CIs) for primary invasive breast cancer were estimated using Cox regression models. All statistical tests were two-sided.

- **Results**: Vitamin C supplement use (ever compared with never) was not associated with breast cancer risk overall. However, it was associated with higher breast cancer risk in women in the fourth quartile of vitamin C intake from foods (HR: 1.32; 95% CI: 1.04, 1.67), though not in other quartiles of dietary vitamin C intake (P-interaction = 0.03).

- **Conclusions**: We observed that vitamin C supplement use was associated with increased postmenopausal breast cancer risk in women with high vitamin C intake from foods. Our data suggest a potential U- or J-shaped relation between total vitamin C intake and postmenopausal breast cancer risk that deserves further investigation.

### Plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration and subsequent risk of total and site-specific cancers in Japanese population: large case-cohort study within Japan Public Health Center-based Prospective Study cohort [^114a2HS2]. BMJ (2018). Low credibility.

In one randomized trial of supplemental vitamin D, 1,179 postmenopausal women were randomized into three groups: calcium plus vitamin D3, calcium plus placebo vitamin D, or both placebo. Women in the calcium plus vitamin D3 group were significantly less likely to develop cancer than those in the placebo group. However, a more recent trial in a similar population, with a larger supplemental dose (2,000 vs 1,100 IU of vitamin D3), failed to produce a significant reduction in total cancer risk. The authors argued that because baseline 25-hydroxyvitamin D in the recent trial was higher (82 vs 72 nmol/L), participants with higher baseline levels were likely to have received less benefit from supplemental vitamin D than those with lower baseline levels. The stronger effect of supplementation in participants with low vitamin D is probably diluted by mild or even a lack of effects in those with higher vitamin status, resulting in modest or null effect sizes seen in trials that included such participants. Data from the Women's Health Initiative Trial showed significant associations between vitamin D and calcium supplementation and a reduced risk of total invasive cancer only in individuals who did not take personal supplements at baseline, and not in the total population (including personal supplement users at baseline), which may support the argument of Lappe et al. Vitamin D concentrations are known to vary by population characteristics globally.

### Vitamin D deficiency is correlated with poor outcomes in patients with luminal-type breast cancer [^116BkqAy]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2011). Low credibility.

Of our 310 patients, 31 (10%) experienced metastasis and 9 (2.9%) died following a median follow-up time of 23 months. Of these nine patients, two died without documented spread of breast cancer. We found that vitamin D concentration was a significant predictor of disease-free survival. Women with sufficient levels of vitamin D had significantly better disease-free survival than women with deficient levels (P = 0.002; Fig. 1). Of the five patients who developed a second primary cancer, four had deficient concentrations of vitamin D (P = 0.012; Table 2). One patient who had sufficient concentrations of vitamin D had pancreatic cancer 19 months after breast cancer diagnosis.

- **Univariate analysis**: Disease-free survival according to vitamin D status.

- **Non-breast second malignancies in the three 25-OHD groups**:

	- Vitamin D status was prognostic in patients with breast cancer of luminal types A and B but not in patients with triple-negative or Her2/neu-enriched cancer subtypes. No evidence could be adduced to indicate that the prognostic effects of vitamin D were related to Her2/neu status. In patients with luminal types of breast cancer, deficient concentrations of vitamin D were associated with significantly lower disease-free survival times (P = 0.004). This association was not observed in patients with non-luminal types of breast cancer (P = 0.475; Fig. 3).

### Vitamin D deficiency is correlated with poor outcomes in patients with luminal-type breast cancer [^1147LcJG]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2011). Low credibility.

Patients were classified based on serum 25-OHD concentration into those with sufficient (30–150 ng/ml), insufficient (20–29 ng/ml), or deficient (< 20 ng/ml) levels of serum 25-OHD. Disease-free survival was defined as the time from surgery to the date of the first locoregional recurrence, distant metastasis, detection of a secondary primary tumor, or death from any cause. Any recurrence at a site, including the contralateral axillary and supraclavicular lymph nodes, was considered a distant metastasis. In contrast, recurrence in a remnant breast, the chest wall, or the axillary or ipsilateral supraclavicular lymph node was considered a locoregional recurrence. The χ² test and analysis of variance (ANOVA) were used to evaluate the significance of differences in clinicopathologic features between groups. Univariate survival was analyzed using the Kaplan–Meier method, and log-rank tests were employed to compare survival curves. Multivariate analyses were conducted using Cox's proportional hazard regression model. All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 12.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL).

### The relationship between vitamin D and breast cancer incidence and natural history [^112gtJQv]. Current Oncology Reports (2010). Low credibility.

The endocrine action of vitamin D and its role in calcium homeostasis and bone health are well known. The discovery that breast epithelial cells possess the same enzyme system as the kidney, permitting local manufacture of active vitamin D (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, or 1,25[(OH)₂D]) from circulating precursors 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D], has suggested an autocrine role for vitamin D as well. Preclinical and ecological studies support a role of vitamin D in the prevention of breast cancer. Results from correlative studies on vitamin D intake or measurement of 25(OH)D, the long-lived precursor, are mixed but suggest a protective effect in premenopausal women.

The large Women's Health Initiative failed to show any reduction in breast cancer incidence in postmenopausal women with a modest amount of vitamin D supplementation. The lack of effect, however, may have been related to trial design. A recent report also suggests that vitamin D may reduce breast cancer recurrence and mortality. Finally, vitamin D is being investigated as a means to reduce aromatase inhibitor-induced joint symptoms.

### Intake of vitamin D and calcium, sun exposure, and risk of breast cancer subtypes among black women [^111HNEZg]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2020). High credibility.

In this population-based breast cancer study of black women, a moderate intake of supplemental vitamin D was associated with a decreased risk of several breast cancer subtypes, with effects that appeared strongest for TNBC. More sunlight exposure was associated with decreased risk, including ER− and TNBC. Prior studies have shown the etiological heterogeneity of breast cancer by ER status among black women, indicating a need to evaluate risk factors separately for different subtypes. The study is the largest investigation at the time of writing to systematically evaluate vitamin D exposure from diet, supplements, and sun exposure, and calcium intake in relation to risk of breast cancer subtypes, including the aggressive TNBCs, among black women.

Several RCTs have examined the effect of vitamin D supplementation on cancer risk, but few had enough breast cancer cases and even fewer included enough black participants. For example, Lappe et al. did not find an effect of supplemental calcium plus 1100 IU vitamin D/d on the incidence of breast cancer. The number of breast cancer cases was small, with 19 cases in the intervention group and 24 in the placebo group. Another RCT, the Vitamin D Assessment study, with 36 breast cancer cases, was also not optimally powered to detect the effect on incidence. VITAL, which had 246 breast cancer cases, found no significant difference in breast cancer incidence comparing the vitamin D supplementation group with the control group. The study included 20% black participants and suggested that vitamin D supplementation may reduce the risk of breast cancer, particularly among black women.
