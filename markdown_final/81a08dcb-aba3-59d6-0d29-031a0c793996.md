## Question

questions to ask a patient who thinks they have autism

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what questions to ask a patient who thinks they have autism. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the diagnostic framework and DSM-5 criteria to anchor the questions. Then, I should verify how to elicit developmental history and current functional impact. Next, I will consider sensory interests, routines, and camouflaging. After that, I need to check for co-occurring conditions and differential diagnoses. Finally, I should review screening tools, cultural and neurodiversity considerations, and how to close the session with next steps and referrals, ensuring each step aligns with evidence and guidelines.

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic anchor so I don't miss anything foundational. Autism spectrum disorder in DSM-5 requires persistent deficits in social communication and social interaction across multiple contexts, plus at least two restricted, repetitive behaviors or interests, with symptoms present from early development and causing clinically significant impairment, and not better explained by another condition, so my questions must map to these domains and developmental timing.

> I will now examine social communication and interaction deficits, and I need to ensure I cover all three required subdomains. Let me ask about social-emotional reciprocity, such as back-and-forth conversation, sharing of interests or emotions, and initiation or response to social interactions, and I should probe nonverbal communication like eye contact, facial expressions, gestures, and integration of verbal and nonverbal cues, and finally I should ask about developing, maintaining, and understanding relationships, including adjusting behavior to context, sharing imaginative play, and making friends, because these are the three required areas in Domain A [^115kCxxb] [^112fF5cC].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about repetitive behaviors. I should confirm at least two of the four DSM-5 features in Domain B. I need to ask about stereotyped movements or speech, insistence on sameness or routines and distress with change, highly restricted fixated interests with abnormal intensity, and hyper- or hyporeactivity to sensory input or unusual sensory interests, because missing one of these can under-identify ASD or misclassify severity [^115kCxxb] [^112fF5cC].

> Next, I should review developmental history and onset, and I need to check whether symptoms were present in the early developmental period even if they became salient later. Let me ask about early milestones, language development, play patterns, and whether there was any regression, and I should confirm that current symptoms cause clinically significant impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning, because onset and functional impact are required elements and often shape severity assignment [^115kCxxb] [^112fF5cC].

> Wait, let me verify how to ask about camouflaging and compensation, especially in adults and those assigned female at birth, because learned strategies can mask core features. I should ask whether they consciously mimic social behaviors, rehearse conversations, or suppress repetitive movements in public, and I should explore whether this masking leads to exhaustion or burnout, since this affects diagnostic sensitivity and explains why some individuals are diagnosed later in life [^1155BRyj].

> I need to ensure I screen for co-occurring conditions that commonly accompany ASD and can confound presentation. Let me ask about attention, hyperactivity, anxiety, mood symptoms, obsessive-compulsive features, sleep and feeding difficulties, sensory processing differences, and seizures or tics, and I should confirm whether any of these are better explanations for the symptoms than ASD, because co-occurring conditions are frequent and influence both diagnosis and treatment planning [^114qjWNb] [^114gGGnH].

> But wait, what if the patient is an adult with limited developmental records. I should double-check how to reconstruct early development. Let me ask about school reports, family anecdotes, old photos or videos, and whether they had early intervention or speech therapy, and I should consider that adult diagnosis is valid but more challenging due to recall and the need to rule out other psychiatric conditions that overlap with ASD features [^1155BRyj] [^115hEoRL].

> Next, I should review screening and diagnostic tools, and I need to be careful not to overstate what they can do. Informant measures like the SRS, SCQ, and the newer ASDQ can help characterize symptoms and track change, but they are not diagnostic, whereas ADOS-2 and ADI-R are gold-standard instruments that require trained clinicians and are best used together with clinical judgment, so I should explain this limitation and plan accordingly [^112Rmg39] [^112i6SJG] [^111k6HT4].

> Hold on, I should verify cultural and linguistic considerations so I don't misinterpret norms. I need to ask about cultural expectations for eye contact, social reciprocity, and routines, and I should consider language barriers and acculturation that might shape symptom expression, because DSM-5 emphasizes context and clinicians must avoid applying culturally biased thresholds [^115H9PXL].

> Let me consider neurodiversity and identity framing, and I should confirm the patient's preferred language and perspective. I should ask how they understand autism, whether they view it as a disorder, a difference, or an identity, and I should explain that my role is to help clarify diagnosis and connect them with supports that align with their goals, not to impose a particular narrative [^116uJbwk] [^112CZAnf].

> I should double-check functional impairment and support needs because DSM-5 severity levels hinge on these. Let me ask about daily living, employment or school performance, social relationships, and whether they need support, substantial support, or very substantial support, and I should clarify that severity reflects current functional impact rather than a fixed trait, which guides service planning [^111Uk87a] [^116tHnW1].

> Next, I should review next steps and referrals, and I need to ensure the plan is concrete. If suspicion remains, I should refer for a comprehensive diagnostic evaluation with a multidisciplinary team, discuss the possibility of genetic testing to identify etiology when indicated, and connect the patient with autism-informed resources and support groups, while explaining that diagnosis is clinical and not based on a blood test or imaging study [^1141vxWD] [^117VByeH] [^112sfLXQ].

> Finally, let me reconsider the flow to ensure I haven't missed a key domain. I should confirm that I've covered social communication deficits, restricted and repetitive behaviors, developmental onset and course, functional impairment, camouflaging, co-occurring conditions, cultural context, and the patient's own perspective, and I should close by summarizing what we've learned together and what the next steps will be, aligning with DSM-5 and best-practice guidance for a respectful, evidence-based assessment [^115kCxxb] [^112fF5cC].

Ask patients who suspect autism about **social communication difficulties** (eye contact, conversation flow, understanding nonliteral language), **restricted/repetitive behaviors** (routines, special interests, sensory sensitivities), and **early developmental patterns** (milestones, regression, camouflaging). Also screen for **co-occurring conditions** (anxiety, ADHD, sensory issues) and functional impact (school, work, relationships). Use open-ended questions and validate experiences to guide next steps, including referral for formal assessment if indicated [^115kCxxb] [^112fF5cC] [^1155BRyj].

---

## Social communication and interaction

Ask about **social-emotional reciprocity** — difficulty with back-and-forth conversation, sharing interests or emotions, or initiating/responding to social interactions — and about **nonverbal communication** — unusual eye contact, body language, or gestures, and trouble understanding others' nonverbal cues. Also explore **relationship development** — difficulty making or keeping friends, adjusting behavior to social contexts, or sharing imaginative play [^115kCxxb] [^112fF5cC].

---

## Restricted and repetitive behaviors

Ask about **repetitive movements or speech** — hand-flapping, rocking, echolalia, or lining up objects — and about **insistence on sameness** — distress with changes, rigid routines, or ritualized behavior. Also inquire about **sensory sensitivities** — hyper- or hyporeactivity to sounds, textures, lights, smells, or tastes, or unusual sensory interests [^115kCxxb] [^112fF5cC].

---

## Developmental history and onset

Ask about **early developmental milestones** — speech, language, social play, and motor development — and whether there was any **regression** — loss of previously acquired skills. Also explore **camouflaging** — learned strategies to mask symptoms in social settings, which can delay diagnosis, especially in adults and women [^1155BRyj] [^115hEoRL].

---

## Co-occurring conditions and functional impact

Screen for **co-occurring conditions** such as anxiety, ADHD, depression, sensory processing differences, and sleep or feeding issues, and assess **functional impact** — how symptoms affect school, work, relationships, and daily living, including the need for support or accommodations [^114qjWNb] [^114gGGnH].

---

## Sample questions

| **Domain** | **Sample questions** |
|-|-|
| Social communication | - Do you find it hard to start or keep conversations going? <br/> - Do you often miss jokes or sarcasm? <br/> - Do you prefer to be alone or find social situations exhausting? |
| Restricted behaviors | - Do you have strong routines or rituals you must follow? <br/> - Do you get upset if plans change unexpectedly? <br/> - Do you have intense interests that occupy most of your time? |
| Sensory sensitivities | - Are you bothered by loud noises, bright lights, or certain textures? <br/> - Do you seek out or avoid specific sensory experiences? |
| Developmental history | - Were there any delays in speech or social development? <br/> - Did you lose any skills around age 2–3? <br/> - Did you mimic peers to fit in socially? |
| Functional impact | - How do these experiences affect your daily life, work, or relationships? <br/> - What kind of support would be helpful for you? |

---

## Clinical approach

Use **open-ended questions** to encourage detailed responses and actively listen with empathy. Validate the patient's experiences and concerns, and explain that autism is a neurodevelopmental difference with strengths and challenges. If indicated, discuss next steps, including referral for formal diagnostic evaluation and connection to resources and support groups [^1155BRyj] [^113ihjLN].

---

These questions align with DSM-5 and help identify autism features while respecting the patient's perspective and guiding appropriate next steps.

### New developments in autism [^115V4Pzi]. The Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

The substantial increase in the prevalence of autism necessitates that practicing physicians become more familiar with the presentation of symptoms to improve early diagnoses and interventions, thus improving the prognosis for affected children. Autism is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder with a triad of core impairments in social interactions, repetitive behaviors, and communication. Clinically, autism appears as a spectrum, with many variations in the severity of defining behaviors and associated symptoms among children. Although the etiology of autism is unknown, it is thought to involve a genetic susceptibility that may be triggered by environmental factors. Because of the high variability in behaviors, biologic findings, and response to treatment, many specialists are assuming a theory of many different autisms, each of which may have a somewhat different etiology and response to treatment. Although there is no known cure for autism, many treatments are available to improve core and associated symptoms.

### Mapping early symptom trajectories in autism spectrum disorder: lessons and challenges for clinical practice and science [^116mm41E]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

Variability in the trajectory of clinical symptoms in the early emerging presentation of young children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) exists within an individual child over time and between different children at any point in time and across time. Georgiades et al. 1 recently coined the term "chronogeneity" to indicate these within- and between-participant patterns of variability over time. In clinical practice, this is often the focus of questions that parents ask clinicians at or soon after diagnosis: "Can you tell us what the future holds and will his (her) symptoms improve or get worse?" The variability or heterogeneity within and between children on the autism spectrum makes that a tough question to answer, however well one understands the motivation of the parent or caregiver in asking it.

### Time to give up on a single explanation for autism [^111zKd8k]. Nature Neuroscience (2006). Medium credibility.

We argue that there will be no single (genetic or cognitive) cause for the diverse symptoms defining autism. We present recent evidence of behavioral fractionation of social impairment, communication difficulties and rigid and repetitive behaviors. Twin data suggest largely nonoverlapping genes acting on each of these traits. At the cognitive level, too, attempts at a single explanation for the symptoms of autism have failed. Implications for research and treatment are discussed.

The clinical calculator "DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for autism spectrum disorder" for autism spectrum disorder.

The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) diagnostic criteria for autism spectrum disorder is a clinical tool designed to identify and diagnose individuals with autism spectrum disorder. The primary components of the DSM-5 criteria include persistent deficits in social communication and interaction across various contexts, restricted and repetitive patterns of behavior or interests, onset of symptoms in early development, and clinically significant impairment in social or occupational functioning. The criteria also necessitate the exclusion of other diagnoses that could better explain the symptoms, such as intellectual disability or global developmental delay.

The DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for autism spectrum disorder is used to determine whether an individual meets the diagnostic criteria for autism spectrum disorder. This is achieved by assessing whether the individual exhibits all the specified characteristics and conditions. If all conditions are met, a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder is made. If not, the diagnostic criteria are not met. This tool is crucial in ensuring accurate diagnosis and subsequent management of autism spectrum disorder.

This tool evaluates whether the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are met. It guides users through selecting statements that correspond to five specific criteria essential for an ASD diagnosis per DSM-5 guidelines. Based on these selections, it provides a determination of whether the criteria are truly met.

The criteria for assessing ASD are:

- Persistent deficits in social communication and interaction across various contexts. These deficits may involve challenges with social-emotional reciprocity, nonverbal communication, and developing personal relationships.
- Presence of restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, or activities. This requires at least two manifestations, such as repetitive behaviors, strict adherence to routines, intense fixated interests, or unusual sensory responses.
- Symptoms must begin in the early developmental period, even if they do not become obvious until social expectations surpass capabilities.
- Symptoms lead to clinically significant impairment in critical areas of functioning, like social and occupational areas.
- Exclusion of other diagnoses that might better account for the symptoms, including intellectual disabilities or developmental delays.

The tool methodically checks each of these criteria:

- Criterion A is about verifying social-communication deficits.
- Criterion B examines the presence of repetitive behaviors or focused interests.
- Criterion C ensures the early onset of symptoms.
- Criterion D checks that the symptoms cause important functional impairments.
- Criterion E confirms that the symptoms are not more aptly explained by other conditions.

All criteria (A, B, C, D, and E) must be true for an individual to meet the ASD diagnostic standards. If all these criteria are satisfied, the outcome will state that the individual "Meets diagnostic criteria for autism spectrum disorder". If any of these criteria are not met, it will indicate that the "Diagnostic criteria are not met". This structured approach ensures thorough assessment aligned with DSM-5 guidelines for diagnosing ASD.

### Identification, evaluation, and management of children with autism spectrum disorder [^115kCxxb]. Pediatrics (2020). High credibility.

DSM-5 criteria for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) specify two domains with required symptom counts and developmental qualifiers. Domain A (social communication/interaction) must include all three of the following: "Social-emotional reciprocity", "Nonverbal communicative behaviors used for social interaction", and "Developing, maintaining, and understanding relationships". Domain B (restricted, repetitive patterns) requires at least 2 of 4 features; the table states "must have 2 of the 4 symptoms", with examples and headings including "Stereotyped or repetitive motor movements, use of objects, or speech", "Extreme distress at small changes, difficulties with transitions, rigid thinking patterns, greeting rituals, need to take same route or eat food every day", "Highly restricted, fixated interests that are abnormal in intensity or focus", and "Hyper- or hyporeactivity to sensory input or unusual interests in sensory aspects of the environment". Additional notes state that symptoms must be present early, cause clinically significant impairment, and are not better explained by intellectual disability or global developmental delay.

### The autistic spectrum: subgroups, boundaries, and treatment [^1118PR3M]. The Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

There is consensus about the disorders that comprise the autistic spectrum, with autistic disorder, Asperger's disorder, and PDD-NOS as the most typical examples and Rett's disorder and disintegrative disorder as the other components. Important controversies regarding the precise definitions of autistic spectrum disorders and the boundaries between the milder manifestations of those disorders, particularly PDD-NOS, and non-autistic conditions have not been and cannot be resolved fully as long as there is no known biologic cause or consistent biologic or psychological marker. This includes issues as basic as whether the autistic spectrum is a predominantly unitary entity or a collection of more or less similar phenotypes with multiple, varying etiologies. This is why the highest long-term priority in the area of definite diagnosis is the search for biologic marker(s) for autism and related autism spectrum disorders [91]. In the absence of a medical test to unequivocally diagnose autism, definitions of autism and related conditions are based only on manifestations in overt behavior, with all the unreliability this entails. In the future, the discovery of biologic correlates, causes, and pathogenetic pathways will undoubtedly change the way in which autism is diagnosed and lead to a new nosology [95]. Until that time the definitions in the current versions of the classification systems should be considered in a state of evolution. The key problem of the current classification systems is the fact that the boundaries between the various disorders are fuzzy. Instead of a categorical approach, a more useful description might be that of "autistic spectrum disorder", which reflects the range of severity of symptoms. Such a dimensional understanding of PDD is useful to clinicians, who may otherwise use nonspecific terms to avoid the categorical diagnosis of autism [31]. Rutter and Schopler [96] argued for separate clinical and research schemes because clinical and research needs are different. For research purposes it is desirable to have as much direct comparability across studies as possible. The focus is on a high degree of homogeneity within diagnostic groupings. A price must be paid for this detailed specification, and the main cost lies in the proportion of cases left undiagnosed. For example, there may be good scientific reasons for a narrowly defined categorical diagnosis that includes only individuals who definitely and clearly have a specifically defined condition and excludes individuals who may have the condition. For clinicians and educators, classification helps guide the selection of treatments for an individual. From this point of view, broader diagnostic concepts may be most appropriate [95].

### What the DSM-5 portends for research, diagnosis, and treatment of autism spectrum disorders [^114182Ue]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2012). Low credibility.

In May 2013 the APA will release DSM-5, which will restructure the diagnostic classification for autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) into a single category. The proposed changes in DSM-5 aim to better reflect the current state of research by consistently identifying the core features in social/communication and restrictive and repetitive behaviors that are specific to ASDs. This review describes the empirical and theoretical bases of research in the nosology of ASDs, given the impending shift in DSM-5 diagnostic criteria. General issues in diagnosis and prevalence are described, with differences between DSM-IV and DSM-5 highlighted. To address concerns about the application of the proposed DSM-5 criteria, the current literature assessing the sensitivity and specificity of the proposed DSM-5 criteria is reviewed. Last, we discuss the implications of the changes in DSM-5 for the treatment of ASDs and recommend areas for future research.

Section 2: Clinical symptoms — diagnostic basis and DSM-5 domains are outlined: Despite advances in neurobiology and genetics, diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) continues to be based on identifying and reporting behaviorally defined clinical symptoms, and in 2013 the DSM-5 consolidated ASD into a single category and emphasized identifying coexisting developmental and behavioral disorders and symptoms. Core symptoms cluster in 2 domains (social communication/interaction and restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior), as described in the DSM-5.

### Early identification of autism spectrum disorder: recommendations for practice and research [^116t2emh]. Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Early identification of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is essential to ensure that children can access specialized evidence-based interventions that can help to optimize long-term outcomes. Early identification also helps shorten the stressful "diagnostic odyssey" that many families experience before diagnosis. There have been important advances in research into the early development of ASDs, incorporating prospective designs and new technologies aimed at more precisely delineating the early emergence of ASD. Thus, an updated review of the state of the science of early identification of ASD was needed to inform best practice. These issues were the focus of a multidisciplinary panel of clinical practitioners and researchers who completed a literature review and reached consensus on current evidence addressing the question "What are the earliest signs and symptoms of ASD in children aged ≤ 24 months that can be used for early identification?" Summary statements address current knowledge on early signs of ASD, potential contributions and limitations of prospective research with high-risk infants, and priorities for promoting the incorporation of this knowledge into clinical practice and future research.

Primary care physicians have the opportunity, especially within the context of the medical home, to be the first point of contact when parents have concerns about their child's development or behavior. The goal of this policy statement is to help the pediatrician recognize the early symptoms of autism and participate in its diagnosis and management. This statement and the accompanying technical report will serve to familiarize the pediatrician with currently accepted criteria defining the spectrum of autism, strategies used in making a diagnosis, and conventional and alternative interventions.

### Recent advances in understanding and managing autism spectrum disorders [^114D6GBH]. Journal of Child Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

Autism spectrum disorder in children is a group of neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by difficulties with social communication and behavior. Growing scientific evidence in addition to clinical practice has led the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) to categorize several disorders into the broader category of autism spectrum disorder. As more is learned about how autism spectrum disorder manifests, progress has been made toward better clinical management including earlier diagnosis, care, and when specific interventions are required. The 2014 Neurobiology of Disease in Children symposium, held in conjunction with the 43rd annual meeting of the Child Neurology Society, aimed to (1) describe the clinical concerns involving diagnosis and treatment, (2) review the current status of understanding in the pathogenesis of autism spectrum disorder, (3) discuss clinical management and therapies for autism spectrum disorder, and (4) define future directions of research. The article summarizes the presentations and includes an edited transcript of question-and-answer sessions.

The heterogeneity inherent in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) makes the identification and diagnosis of ASD complex. We survey a large number of diagnostic tools, including screeners and tools designed for in-depth assessment. We also discuss the challenges presented by overlapping symptomatology between ASD and other disorders and the need to determine whether a diagnosis of ASD or another diagnosis best explains the individual's symptoms. We conclude with a call to action for the next steps necessary for meeting the diagnostic challenges presented here to improve the diagnostic process and to help understand each individual's particular ASD profile.

### Diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder: reconciling the syndrome, its diverse origins, and variation in expression [^1154UuhD]. The Lancet: Neurology (2016). Medium credibility.

Recent discoveries about the pathogenesis and symptom structure of autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are challenging traditional nosology and driving efforts to reconceptualise the diagnosis of autism, a goal made all the more pressing by new prospects for early identification, targeted intervention, and personalised-medicine approaches to specific autistic syndromes. Recognition that ASD represents the severe end of a continuous distribution of social communication abilities in the general population has stimulated attempts to standardise the measurement of autistic traits and to set appropriate clinical thresholds for diagnosis. Over the next decade, rapid advances in our understanding of symptom structure and the diversity of causes of ASD could be incorporated into the next evolution in the diagnosis of autism, with important implications for research, clinical practice, public health, and policy. As differential effects of personalised therapies are identified in relation to specific causes of autism, the benefits of an updated diagnostic nosology will translate into the delivery of more effective care for patients.

Introduction

To date, Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is usually conceptualized as a neurodevelopmental, behaviorally defined disorder whose symptoms emerge in early development, are present in multiple contexts and persist over lifespan. Although ASD emerges from a genetic and neurobiological background, defining biological markers has not been identified. The diagnostic decision still relies on direct observation, reported behavior, and qualitative symptom descriptions and is thus dependent on subjective evaluations by clinicians. Despite its apparent subjective nature, clinical expertise is currently the only guarantor of maintaining diagnostic accuracy.

Time trends in the conceptualization of autism

Over time, the definition of autism has alternated between narrower and broader views of the disorder: From the first inclusion of "infantile autism" in DSM-III as one subgroup of "Pervasive Developmental Disorders" to the term ASD as a neurodevelopmental disorder in DSM-5. Lately, concepts of neurodiversity and the social model of disability have gained prominence and challenged traditional ideas about ASD as a disorder. In this conceptualization, ASD is one form of variation within a diversity of minds and the difficulties are not understood as a deficit or disorder, but rather as a poor fit between individual's characteristics and demands by the environment, so that search for a cure is being rejected. As this conceptualization of ASD is defined rather by strengths than deficits, an ASD diagnosis offers the person a positive identity and active community. A gap has emerged between considering ASD a "disorder/disability" and "diversity/identity" with different implications for conceptualization of ASD as well as treatment.

### Autism: from research to practice [^111QCjZd]. The American Psychologist (2010). Low credibility.

Autism is the most commonly studied of a spectrum of developmental disorders that are believed to be neurobiologically based but which, at this point, for lack of good biomarkers, are defined purely by behavior. In the last 20 years, the definition of autism has shifted in emphasis from extreme aloofness and positive signs of abnormality in repetitive and sensorimotor behaviors to a greater awareness of the importance of more subtle reciprocal social communication deficits as core features. Standard diagnostic instruments were developed for research purposes to acquire information both through caregiver interviews and direct clinical observation. Use of these instruments in clinical practice resulted in major improvements, which in turn affected research results. These results yielded further improvements that led to changes in clinical practice over time. The synergism between research and clinical practice in the understanding of autism is discussed.

### Psychometric evaluation of the autism symptom dimensions questionnaire [^1157fEHU]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

What this paper adds
The Autism Symptom Dimensions Questionnaire (ASDQ) is a new, freely available measure of autism symptoms.
In two samples, the ASDQ showed good reliability and validity.
The ASDQ showed good screening value for autism spectrum disorder and detected improvements during behavioral interventions.
The ASDQ provides only weak predictive value in diagnostic settings.

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a heterogeneous set of conditions characterized by qualitative impairment in social interactions and communication and the presence of restricted and repetitive behaviors (RRBs) and interests. Many individuals diagnosed with ASD experience persistence of symptoms into adulthood, with an array of additional cognitive, neurodevelopmental, neuropsychiatric, medical, and social challenges. Thus, the lifetime costs of ASD have been estimated to be very substantial at the individual and societal levels. A key element of improving the trajectory and outcome of individuals with ASD is the sensitive and comprehensive capture of autism symptoms. Accurate measurement is crucial for timely and comprehensive characterization and longitudinal monitoring, including tracking symptom change with development and during psychosocial or medical interventions. While clinical interview and observation measures have a key role, informant (caregiver)‐reported measures can provide unique information with implications for clinical practice (screening, diagnostic evaluation, more detailed and quantitative characterization of specific phenotypic features, and intervention monitoring) and research (phenotypic characterization and longitudinal studies).

Our group recently reported initial psychometric characteristics for a newly developed open‐source measure, the Autism Symptom Dimensions Questionnaire (ASDQ). The ASDQ was created with stakeholder input and designed to be brief while providing both coverage of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM‐5) criteria as well as key ASD subdimensions that have consistently emerged across factor analytical studies of the ASD phenotype and thus aligned with a state‐of‐the‐art understanding of the structure of ASD. Comprehensive domain coverage is an advantage over existing measures, which tend to provide only broad scores that conflate distinct groups of symptoms and are not consistent with current incarnations of categorical diagnostic systems nor with evidence‐based clinical taxonomies. The open‐source nature of ASDQ is also a particularly important feature because commercial measures can add significant expense in clinical and research applications and are therefore ill‐suited for frequent longitudinal tracking or the development of large sample cohorts. This problem specifically disadvantages research and clinical practice in low‐ and middle‐income countries.

### Identification, evaluation, and management of children with autism spectrum disorder [^112jumh2]. Pediatrics (2020). High credibility.

Table 10 — medication use considerations in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) — no current medication corrects core social and communication symptoms of ASD; medication is used to help manage coexisting behavioral health disorders and associated problem behaviors or symptoms causing significant impairment and distress; medication should only be considered after careful accounting of when the behavior started and what seems to exacerbate it and a functional behavioral assessment should guide development of a treatment plan in the school setting; consider referral to a behavior therapist outside of school to assess the reasons for the behavior, provide the family with strategies, and collaborate in care; obtain a careful history and physical to look for medical factors that may cause or exacerbate challenging behaviors; consider medication after treatable medical conditions and behavioral factors are assessed and intervention does not address the symptoms of concern; and include the family and patient in shared decision making that considers their goals and values.

### Diagnostic evaluation of autism spectrum disorders [^111Yg6Nz]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Research on the identification and evaluation of autism spectrum disorders is reviewed, and best practices for clinical work are discussed. The latest research on diagnostic tools, and their recommended use, is also reviewed. Recommendations include the use of instruments designed to assess multiple domains of functioning and behavior, the inclusion of parents and caregivers as active partners, and the consideration of developmental factors throughout the diagnostic process.

### Autism spectrum disorder [^113ihjLN]. Lancet (2018). Excellent credibility.

Autism spectrum disorder is a term used to describe a constellation of early-appearing social communication deficits and repetitive sensory-motor behaviours associated with a strong genetic component as well as other causes. The outlook for many individuals with autism spectrum disorder today is brighter than it was 50 years ago; more people with the condition are able to speak, read, and live in the community rather than in institutions, and some will be largely free from symptoms of the disorder by adulthood. Nevertheless, most individuals will not work full-time or live independently. Genetics and neuroscience have identified intriguing patterns of risk, but without much practical benefit yet. Considerable work is still needed to understand how and when behavioural and medical treatments can be effective, and for which children, including those with substantial comorbidities. It is also important to implement what we already know and develop services for adults with autism spectrum disorder. Clinicians can make a difference by providing timely and individualised help to families navigating referrals and access to community support systems, by providing accurate information despite often unfiltered media input, and by anticipating transitions such as family changes and school entry and leaving.

### What DSM-5 could mean to children with autism and their families [^111zMtdA]. JAMA Pediatrics (2013). Medium credibility.

The American Psychiatric Association will update its Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders to its fifth edition (DSM-5). With this new edition, the classification and diagnostic criteria for the spectrum of autistic disorders will change and become more specific and potentially more restrictive. Rather than maintaining several subcategories of autism including Asperger syndrome, there will be one new category called autism spectrum disorder. This change may alter which children are diagnosed as having autism as well as modify eligibility for treatment, educational, and other support services. We review the history and rationale for the proposed changes as well as several recent studies that have attempted to gauge the impact of these changes on children and families. We also consider how the proposed changes are likely to create new challenges for parents who are attempting to organize their children's care and for pediatricians who are providing that care and assisting with care coordination.

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) research agenda — The committee's 2009 strategic plan, updated in 2017, identified 7 areas for research funding: (1) early detection, (2) underlying biology, (3) genetic and environmental risk factors, (4) treatments and interventions, (5) services and implementation science, (6) lifespan services and supports, and (7) epidemiological surveillance and infrastructure, and research in all of these areas is critical to move forward with early diagnosis, effective treatment, and evidence-based interventions at each age. The committee recommended that multiple levels of inquiry be pursued simultaneously to inform evidence-based clinical care, including basic and translational science in the areas of genetics and epigenetics, neurobiology, and psychopharmacology to develop ASD-specific behavioral and pharmacologic therapies and to identify and understand ASD risk factors; research into the underlying neurobiology of sensory symptoms and restricted interests and repetitive behaviors to inform development of targeted interventions; clinical trials to test focused interventions based on the underlying biological processes involved with ASD to determine if they are appropriate for community application; epidemiological surveillance to gather data important for planning for current and future needs, including screening, diagnosis, and lifespan health and mental health services; and health services research to provide guidance for comprehensive, accessible, and culturally appropriate medical, educational, and behavioral care for children, youth, adults, and families affected by ASD.

### Autism spectrum disorder in ICD-11-a critical reflection of its possible impact on clinical practice and research [^116HKcR8]. Molecular Psychiatry (2024). Medium credibility.

This perspective article compares and contrasts the conceptualization of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in ICD-11 and DSM-5. By guiding the user through the ICD-11 text, it is argued that, in contrast to DSM-5, ICD-11 allows a high variety in symptom combinations, which results in an operationalization of ASD that is in favor of an extreme diverse picture, yet possibly at the expense of precision, including unforeseeable effects on clinical practice, care, and research. The clinical utility is questionable as this conceptualization can hardly be differentiated from other mental disorders and autism-like traits. It moves away from an observable, behavioral, and neurodevelopmental disorder to a disorder of inner experience that can hardly be measured objectively. It contains many vague and subjective concepts that lead to non-falsifiable diagnoses. This bears a large danger of false positive diagnoses, of further increased prevalence rates, limitations of access to ASD-specific services and of increasing the non-specificity of treatments. For research, the hypothesis is that the specificity of ASD will be reduced and this will additional increase the already high heterogeneity with the effect that replication of studies will be hampered. This could limit our understanding of etiology and biological pathways of ASD and bears the risk that precision medicine, i.e., a targeted approach for individual treatment strategies based on precise diagnostic markers, is more far from becoming reality. Thus, a more precise, quantitative description and more objective measurement of symptoms are suggested that define the clinical ASD phenotype. Identification of core ASD subtypes/endophenotypes and a precise description of symptoms is the necessary next step to advance diagnostic classification systems. Therefore, employing a more finely grained, objective, clinical symptom characterization which is more relatable to neurobehavioral concepts is of central significance.

### Autism spectrum disorder [^113jHjaM]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2020). High credibility.

Autism spectrum disorder is a construct used to describe individuals with a specific combination of impairments in social communication and repetitive behaviours, highly restricted interests and/or sensory behaviours beginning early in life. The worldwide prevalence of autism is just under 1%, but estimates are higher in high-income countries. Although gross brain pathology is not characteristic of autism, subtle anatomical and functional differences have been observed in post-mortem, neuroimaging and electrophysiological studies. Initially, it was hoped that accurate measurement of behavioural phenotypes would lead to specific genetic subtypes, but genetic findings have mainly applied to heterogeneous groups that are not specific to autism. Psychosocial interventions in children can improve specific behaviours, such as joint attention, language and social engagement, that may affect further development and could reduce symptom severity. However, further research is necessary to identify the long-term needs of people with autism, and treatments and the mechanisms behind them that could result in improved independence and quality of life over time. Families are often the major source of support for people with autism throughout much of life and need to be considered, along with the perspectives of autistic individuals, in both research and practice.

### Autism spectrum disorder: advances in diagnosis and evaluation [^111ue3PC]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has a variety of causes, and its clinical expression is generally associated with substantial disability throughout the lifespan. Recent advances have led to earlier diagnosis, and deep phenotyping efforts focused on high risk infants have helped advance the characterization of early behavioral trajectories. Moreover, biomarkers that measure early structural and functional connectivity, visual orienting, and other biological processes have shown promise in detecting the risk of autism spectrum disorder even before the emergence of overt behavioral symptoms. Despite these advances, the mean age of diagnosis is still 4–5 years. Because of the broad consistency in published guidelines, parameters for high quality comprehensive assessments are available; however, such models are resource intensive and high demand can result in greatly increased waiting times. This review describes advances in detecting early behavioral and biological markers, current options and controversies in screening for the disorder, and best practice in its diagnostic evaluation including emerging data on innovative service models.

### Patterns of autism symptoms: hidden structure in the ADOS and ADI-R instruments [^112i6SJG]. Translational Psychiatry (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Autism-spectrum disorder (hereafter "autism") is clinically defined by different types of symptoms: deficits in communication and social interaction, as well as restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, or activities. The authors of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual-5 (DSM-5)have defined autism as an umbrella term for different clinical entities in the autistic spectrum substantiated by empirical findings showing that neither clinically nor neuropsychologically different subdiagnoses could be clearly demarcated from each other. Whereas the differentiation between clinical subgroups was skipped, the differentiation between degrees of severity has been newly included. This reintroduces the research question how specific subgroups, e.g. based on severity, may map onto symptom presentations.

This evaluation involves a team of well-trained professionals and integrates information about the individual from different sources. Two clinical tools have become established in this assessment procedure, and are considered to be the "gold standard" in symptom evaluation for autism, particularly when combined with clinical judgment: (i) the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R), a semistructured interview conducted with parents, which focuses on current presentation and lifelong developmental history, and (ii) the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS), a standardized semistructured diagnosis assessment conducted through one-to-one personal interaction and direct observation of an individual suspected to have autism using a range of activities and delivered by a trained examiner. A combination of ADI-R and ADOS assessments coupled with experienced clinical judgments has previously been shown to improve diagnostic validity. In everyday clinical practice, however, often only one of the instruments is used due to time, cost, or expertise constraints. The choice of preferred instrument used for the evaluation of autism symptoms remains quite variable from one center to another.

### Diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder across the lifespan [^113R7Aou]. The Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2020). Medium credibility.

Although autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is one of the most common neurodevelopmental disorders it is also one of the most heterogeneous conditions, making identification and diagnosis complex. The importance of a stable and consistent diagnosis cannot be overstated. An accurate diagnosis is the basis for understanding the individual and establishing an individualized treatment plan. We present those elements that should be included in any assessment for ASD and describe the ways in which ASD typically manifests itself at various developmental stages. The implications and challenges for assessment at different ages and levels of functioning are discussed.

### Autism spectrum disorder: primary care principles [^116E6WTF]. American Family Physician (2016). Low credibility.

Autism spectrum disorder is characterized by difficulty with social communication and restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior, interest, or activities. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th ed., created an umbrella diagnosis that includes several previously separate conditions: autistic disorder, Asperger syndrome, childhood disintegrative disorder, and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified. There is insufficient evidence to recommend screening for autism spectrum disorder in children 18 to 30 months of age in whom the disorder is not suspected; however, there is a growing body of evidence that early intensive behavioral intervention based on applied behavior analysis improves cognitive ability, language, and adaptive skills. Therefore, early identification of autism spectrum disorder is important, and experts recommend the use of a validated screening tool at 18- and 24-month well-child visits. Medications can be used as adjunctive treatment for maladaptive behaviors and comorbid psychiatric conditions, but there is no single medical therapy that is effective for all symptoms of autism spectrum disorder. Prognosis is heavily affected by the severity of diagnosis and the presence of intellectual disability. Children with optimal outcomes receive earlier, more intensive behavioral interventions and less pharmacologic treatment.

### Neural signatures of social inferences predict the number of real-life social contacts and autism severity [^114US9vq]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

We regularly infer other people's thoughts and feelings from observing their actions, but how this ability contributes to successful social behavior and interactions remains unknown. We show that neural activation patterns during social inferences obtained in the laboratory predict the number of social contacts in the real world, as measured by the social network index, in three neurotypical samples (total n = 126) and one sample of autistic adults (n = 23). We also show that brain patterns during social inference generalize across individuals in these groups. Cross-validated associations between brain activations and social inference localize selectively to the right posterior superior temporal sulcus and were specific for social, but not nonsocial, inference. Activation within this same brain region also predicts autism-like trait scores from questionnaires and autism symptom severity. Thus, neural activations produced while thinking about other people's mental states predict variance in multiple indices of social functioning in the real world.

### Identification, evaluation, and management of children with autism spectrum disorder [^112fF5cC]. Pediatrics (2020). High credibility.

DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) — domain structure, required symptom counts, and continuity from DSM-IV are outlined: In the DSM-5, core symptoms were divided into 2 domains (social communication and social interaction and restrictive, repetitive patterns of behaviors), and to fulfill diagnostic criteria for ASD by using the DSM-5, all 3 symptoms of social affective difference need to be present in addition to 2 of 4 symptoms related to restrictive and repetitive behaviors; the recognition of symptoms of ASD related to sensory processing led to the inclusion of sensory symptoms, such as hyper- or hyporeactivity to sensory input or unusual interests in sensory aspects of the environment, and the DSM-5 notes that a diagnosis may be made at older ages, when the demands of the social or school environment may result in functional impairment; almost all individuals with a diagnosis of autistic disorder or Asperger syndrome by using DSM-IV criteria would be diagnosed with ASD by using DSM-5 criteria, and the CDC ADDM Network looked at its chart abstraction data on 8-year-old children; this analysis revealed that more than 80% of children diagnosed with PDD-NOS would also be diagnosed with ASD; there is a high level of agreement of surveillance data by using DSM-IV-TR and DSM-5 criteria; and the DSM-5 criteria have been shown to appropriately identify younger children and those with mild symptoms.

Assessment — Recommendation 1: The developmental assessment of young children and the psychiatric assessment of all children should routinely include questions about ASD symptomatology [CS]. Screening should include inquiries about the core symptoms of ASD, including social relatedness and repetitive or unusual behaviors.

### Autism spectrum disorder in primary care [^113ib7FP]. American Family Physician (2025). Medium credibility.

Autism is a lifelong neurodevelopmental condition that affects approximately 1 in 31 US children and 1 in 45 US adults; autism spectrum disorder includes a wide range of neurologic diversity, symptoms, challenges, strengths, and abilities. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th ed., text revision criteria for autism spectrum disorder require deficits in three areas of communication and social interaction across multiple settings, with at least two restricted or repetitive behaviors, not explained by another condition, and causing functional impairment. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends screening for autism at ages 18 and 24 months in addition to routine developmental surveillance, whereas screening in adults is not recommended. Diagnosis should include a multidisciplinary team and a multidimensional assessment. Autistic individuals have a 20- to 30-year lower life expectancy than nonautistic people and experience higher rates of many chronic conditions, such as diabetes, epilepsy, gastrointestinal concerns, feeding disorders, and mental health disorders (eg, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, depression, anxiety, schizophrenia). Treatment of children with autism spectrum disorder focuses on minimizing core deficits, maximizing functional independence, and preventing problem behaviors. Pharmacologic therapy may be indicated for related conditions or symptoms, such as sleep disorders, seizures, mental health conditions, behavior problems, and gastrointestinal issues. Melatonin effectively reduces sleep symptoms and improves daytime behaviors with minimal adverse effects. The SPACE (sensory, predictability, acceptance, communication, empathy) framework provides specific interventions that make health care more accessible and affirming to autistic patients.

### Autism spectrum heterogeneity: fact or artifact? [^115o17Yt]. Molecular Psychiatry (2020). Medium credibility.

Re-conceptualize autistic signs/traits

The relationship, either mechanistic or phenotypic, between "autistic traits" and autism, implied by the use of the term "autistic" trait rather than "social" or "repetitive" trait, should be scientifically validated, despite some potentially superficial resemblance. Their "autistic" quality should be ascertained by a) their qualitative aspects, b) their co-occurrence in the prototypical condition, and c) their contextual validation, as the demonstration of a previous, developmentally anterior, above-threshold presentation. Trait studies in the general population or certain non-autistic conditions are not informative about above-threshold autism unless the trait-autism link is validated, revealing the weak overlap between genetic proximity and phenotypic similarity. Until there is such validation, "autistic traits" are not yet "autistic". The very notion of "autistic traits", as in "are there autistic traits in the condition X" may be flawed outside of a context in which their autistic nature is validated.

### The diagnostic odyssey of autism spectrum disorder [^112adXNp]. Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by challenges in social communication and interaction and restricted or repetitive behavior, interests, or activities. Although ASD symptoms generally manifest in early childhood, many individuals experience delays accessing an autism diagnosis and related services. In this study, we identify the individual, social, and structural factors that influence parents' experiences of children's ASD diagnosis.

Methods

Parents of 25 children with autism participated in 60- to 90-minute semistructured in-person interviews. Interviews were recorded and transcribed verbatim. Transcripts were analyzed using the method of grounded theory. This inductive method allowed analysts to identify key themes related to participants' experiences of children's ASD diagnosis.

Results

The process of ASD diagnosis reflects an odyssey that includes 3 key phases: the prediagnosis phase, in which "Making Sense of Child Difference" is a primary characteristic of participants' experiences; the during-diagnosis phase, when "Navigating Diagnosis" suggests systematic barriers that influence the timing of ASD diagnosis; and the postdiagnosis phase, when participants' experiences of "Connecting to Services" point to the important role that personal efforts play in gaining access to care.

Conclusions

In this study, we highlight individual, social, and structural factors that influence parent experiences before, during, and after their child's autism diagnosis. Our findings indicate the need for more consistent and continuous support for autistic individuals and their families during the diagnostic odyssey, as well as resources that better represent the diversity of experiences and symptoms associated with autism across the life course.

### Expediting clinician assessment in the diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder [^117J1zPk]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is estimated to affect 1 in 59 children in the general population. 1 ASD diagnosis is exclusively clinical, although frequent discoveries are being made in elucidating its complex genetic and neurological basis. 2 Key components of diagnosing ASD include a positive developmental history, current symptoms, symptoms that cannot be better explained using an alternative diagnosis, and observational confirmation using DSM‐5 criteria. 3 Patients are typically referred to specialized providers who use standard clinical measures to diagnose and differentiate ASD from other disorders. Traditional measures, such as the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule, Second Edition (ADOS‐2) or Autism Diagnostic Interview Revised, employed by most autism specialists are time‐consuming, require extensive training, and are performed by specialized providers. 4, 5 Additionally, some studies have suggested that both the ADOS‐2 and Autism Diagnostic Interview Revised should be performed together because they better reflect a best estimate diagnosis of ASD. 6 This can result in substantial delay between the time when a child is first suspected of having ASD, is referred to a particular provider, completes the diagnostic process, and finally receives management/therapy services. Parents have reported visiting, on average, four to five clinicians en route to an ASD diagnosis and a significant number have reported dissatisfaction and distress with the process. 7, 8, 9 Such delays contribute to the fact that, across the USA, the average diagnosis is in the fourth year of life, even though symptoms are present in most affected children before the age of 2 years. Minimizing the time between initial suspicion of ASD and treatment is critical to maximizing the impact of interventions for this disorder. 10

### Identification, evaluation, and management of children with autism spectrum disorder [^114VmoUP]. Pediatrics (2020). High credibility.

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) — disruptive behaviors and management states that disruptive behaviors, such as aggression, self-injury, and tantrums, may complicate home and community management, and behavioral outbursts may occur in response to stressful events in the environment, in reaction to a medical condition, as functional communication, or as a symptom supporting diagnosis of a cooccurring mental health disorder. Functional behavioral analysis and implementation of behavioral strategies can be an important initial step in management, new onset of severe behaviors requires consideration of potential medical reasons, and pharmacologic treatment should be considered if no medical etiology is identified and if the behavior is associated with irritability, is not responsive to available behavioral interventions, or is related to a cooccurring diagnosable behavioral health disorder.

### Psychometric evaluation of the autism symptom dimensions questionnaire [^113VD4qj]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Aim

To replicate and extend previous psychometric findings for the Autism Symptom Dimensions Questionnaire (ASDQ).

Method

Using a cross-sectional design in two samples, including a total of 3366 children and adolescents (aged 2-17years; 1399 with autism spectrum disorder) and a small case series, factor structure, measurement invariance, reliability, construct validity, screening and diagnostic efficiency, and detection of reliable change were examined for the ASDQ.

Results

Strong psychometric properties were observed, including replicable factor structure, strong measurement invariance, adequate-to-excellent scale and conditional reliability, strong convergent and discriminant validity, and good screening efficiency. Importantly, two crucial measurement aspects required for a good treatment outcome measure were found, that is, good test-retest stability and the potential to detect reliable change. As expected for an informant-reported questionnaire, diagnostic efficiency was weak.

Interpretation

The ASDQ showed evidence of favorable and well-replicated psychometric properties in two samples. Good screening but weak diagnostic efficiency, coupled with good test-retest stability, suggest that optimal clinical use is in screening and in detailed clinical characterization beyond what is offered by current informant-reported measures, with the potential for monitoring response to intervention. Despite relative brevity, the ASDQ provides good coverage of broad and specific aspects of the autism behavioral phenotype, which is consistent with the criteria of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition.

### About autism spectrum disorder… [^1124AwpG]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Autism spectrum disorder is a developmental disability caused by differences in the brain.
- Some people with ASD have a known difference, such as a genetic condition. Other causes are not yet known.
- Scientists believe there are multiple causes of ASD that act together to change the most common ways people develop. We still have much to learn about these causes and how they impact people with ASD.
- Early intervention services can greatly improve the development of a child with ASD. Overview People with ASD may behave, communicate, interact, and learn in ways that are different from most other people. There is often nothing about how they look that sets them apart from other people. The abilities of people with ASD can vary significantly. For example, some people with ASD may have advanced conversation skills whereas others may be nonverbal. Some people with ASD need a lot of help in their daily lives; others can work and live with little to no support.

ASD begins before the age of 3 years and can last throughout a person's life, although symptoms may change over time. Some children show ASD symptoms within the first 12 months of life. In others, symptoms may not show up until 24 months of age or later. Some children with ASD gain new skills and meet developmental milestones until around 18 to 24 months of age, and then they stop gaining new skills or lose the skills they once had. As children with ASD become adolescents and young adults, they may have difficulties developing and maintaining friendships, communicating with peers and adults, or understanding what behaviors are expected in school or on the job. They may come to the attention of healthcare providers because they also have conditions such as anxiety, depression, or attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, which occur more often in people with ASD than in people without ASD.

Signs and symptoms People with ASD often have problems with social communication and interaction, and restricted or repetitive behaviors or interests. People with ASD may also have different ways of learning, moving, or paying attention. These characteristics can make life very challenging. It is important to note that some people without ASD might also have some of these symptoms. Keep Reading: Signs and Symptoms of Autism Spectrum Disorder. "Learn the Signs. Act Early. " As a parent, you already have what it takes to help your young child learn and grow. CDC has developed materials to help you track your child's developmental milestones and share that progress, or any concerns, with your child's doctor at every check-up. CDC's "Learn the Signs. Act Early.

" program aims to improve early identification of developmental delays and disabilities, such as ASD, by promoting early childhood developmental monitoring by families, child care providers, healthcare providers, and others. Risk factors There is not just one cause of ASD. Many different factors have been identified that may make a child more likely to have ASD, including environmental, biologic, and genetic factors. Although we know little about specific causes, the available evidence suggests that the following may put children at greater risk for developing ASD: CDC is currently working on one of the largest US studies to date on ASD. This study, called Study to Explore Early Development was designed to look at the risk factors and behaviors related to ASD among young children in the US.

Abstract

Aim

To replicate and extend previous psychometric findings for the Autism Symptom Dimensions Questionnaire (ASDQ).

Method

Using a cross‐sectional design in two samples, including a total of 3366 children and adolescents (aged 2–17 years; 1399 with autism spectrum disorder) and a small case series, factor structure, measurement invariance, reliability, construct validity, screening and diagnostic efficiency, and detection of reliable change were examined for the ASDQ.

Results

Strong psychometric properties were observed, including replicable factor structure, strong measurement invariance, adequate‐to‐excellent scale and conditional reliability, strong convergent and discriminant validity, and good screening efficiency. Importantly, two crucial measurement aspects required for a good treatment outcome measure were found, that is, good test–retest stability and the potential to detect reliable change. As expected for an informant‐reported questionnaire, diagnostic efficiency was weak.

Interpretation

The ASDQ showed evidence of favorable and well‐replicated psychometric properties in two samples. Good screening but weak diagnostic efficiency, coupled with good test–retest stability, suggest that optimal clinical use is in screening and in detailed clinical characterization beyond what is offered by current informant‐reported measures, with the potential for monitoring response to intervention. Despite relative brevity, the ASDQ provides good coverage of broad and specific aspects of the autism behavioral phenotype, which is consistent with the criteria of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition.

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in children — American Academy of Pediatrics clinical report — notes a U.S. prevalence of 1 in 59 children (approximately 1.7%) and that core deficits are identified in 2 domains: social communication/interaction and restrictive, repetitive patterns of behavior. Standardized screening for ASD at 18 and 24 months of age with ongoing developmental surveillance continues to be recommended in primary care (although it may be performed in other settings), because ASD is common, can be diagnosed as young as 18 months of age, and has evidenced-based interventions that may improve function. Primary care providers should be familiar with the diagnostic criteria for ASD, appropriate etiologic evaluation, and co-occurring medical and behavioral conditions (such as disorders of sleep and feeding, gastrointestinal tract symptoms, obesity, seizures, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, anxiety, and wandering) that affect the child's function and quality of life. Shared decision making calls for collaboration with families in evaluation and choice of interventions.

### Identification, evaluation, and management of children with autism spectrum disorder [^1141vxWD]. Pediatrics (2020). High credibility.

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) diagnostic evaluation — primary care and referral is indicated once a child is determined to be at risk for a diagnosis of ASD, with timely referral for clinical diagnostic evaluation and early intervention or school services, and children with developmental delay with or without an ASD diagnosis should be referred to early intervention or school services in which cognitive and language testing may be completed. The primary care provider should discuss with the family the importance of both the assessment of developmental status and evaluation for an ASD diagnosis and assist the family in navigating through the process. Although most children will need to see a specialist, general pediatricians and child psychologists comfortable with application of the DSM-5 criteria can make an initial clinical diagnosis. At this time, there are no laboratory tests that can be used to make a diagnosis of ASD, so careful review of the child's behavioral history and direct observation of symptoms are necessary; to meet diagnostic criteria, the symptoms must impair function, and formal assessment of language, cognitive, and adaptive abilities and sensory status is an important component of the diagnostic process. Short clinical visits may not allow even a skilled clinician the opportunity to accurately recognize symptoms of ASD, and the history of symptoms of ASD can be supported by questionnaires such as the SCQ or Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS), but none of these questionnaires is sufficient alone to make a diagnosis of ASD.

### The many meanings of autism: conceptual and ethical reflections [^116uJbwk]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Autism as a phenomenon has raised a plethora of ethical questions, both for clinicians and diagnosticians as well as for researchers. 1, 2, 3 For example, how should clinicians respond to the feeling sometimes expressed by certain scholars and in the media that 'too many children are given a psychiatric diagnosis nowadays'? 4 What if a child is officially in the so‐called subclinical range for autism but an autism approach would be of great benefit to the child? Should a diagnosis be withheld? Which terms should be used to explain autism to people who have recently received a diagnosis for themselves or their child? It may be helpful to use biological terminology ('a differently wired brain'), but should clinicians also convey the existing uncertainties regarding the aetiology of autism? Autism researchers and those who fund autism research may be confronted with questions related to how to set research priorities, and with sometimes incompatible views among stakeholders (parents of autistic children, adults with a diagnosis of autism, clinicians). Should research on autism be focussed on finding its biological origins, or on finding treatment? And does treatment consist of finding a 'cure' for autism for some of its more challenging behavioural expressions, or of finding better ways in which autistic people can flourish in society. Moreover, as some authors have argued, what wellbeing actually is for an 'autistic person' may very well not be the same as what wellbeing is for the more typically developing population. 5, 6 In this paper, I will use identity‐first language ('autistic person', 'autistic people'), as research suggests that this is the formulation that the majority of autistic people prefer. 7

In what follows, I will not tackle these questions as such; answering these questions presupposes that we first find a common ground about how to talk about autism. Therefore, I will first describe the conceptual challenges that ethicists face when making sense of the ethical questions surrounding autism. I will then give an overview of the normative function of biological explanations of autism in the debate. Finally, I use the idea of epigenetics, and the thinking of French medical doctor and philosopher Georges Canguilhem to suggest a non‐reductionist way of looking at autism that considers the lived experience of autistic people as scientifically relevant.

### Practice parameter for the assessment and treatment of children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorder [^115H9PXL]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2014). Medium credibility.

Autism spectrum disorder — observational assessment and instruments: Observation of the child should focus on broad areas of social interaction and restricted, repetitive behaviors, with the child's age and developmental level possibly dictating modifications to assessment procedures and sensitivity to ethnic, cultural, or socioeconomic factors that may affect assessment. Various instruments for the assessment of ASD have been developed; as a practical matter these instruments vary in usefulness for usual clinical practice, some require specific training, and their use supplements but does not replace informed clinical judgment.

### Pharmacologic treatment of behavioral symptoms in autism and pervasive developmental disorders [^1139QugV]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2005). Low credibility.

Autism and other pervasive developmental disorders (PDDs) are associated with various dysfunctional and problematic behaviors, in addition to the core features of language and social skills dysfunction that define these conditions. Although there is currently no pharmacologic cure for the core features of PDDs, some of the behavioral symptoms may be treated pharmacologically. In addition to relieving some of the daily stress in the lives of patients and their families, improvement of these behavioral symptoms, which include hyperactivity, aggression, tantrums, and self-injury, removes some of the hindrances to other rehabilitative efforts. This article discusses the efficacy and tolerability of various medications and alternative interventions in addressing the symptoms of autism and other PDDs.

### Identification, evaluation, and management of children with autism spectrum disorder [^116tHnW1]. Pediatrics (2020). High credibility.

DSM-5 severity rating and specifiers for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) — scope and limitations are characterized: The DSM-5 also introduced an approach to severity rating, which is summarized in Table 2, and severity rating reflects the impairment of the ASD symptoms and the resultant service needs of the individual; severity rating is not a quantifiable score that can be used to monitor progress at this time, and in clinical use, it often reflects the impact of cognitive limitations; to date, no single measure adequately reflects the combination of medical, behavioral, and educational severity in a fashion that will help clinicians and families determine progress with intervention across multiple functional domains; the DSM-5 includes course specifiers that help describe the status of symptoms of individuals with ASD, with course specifiers including the presence or absence of intellectual impairment, language impairment, catatonia, medical conditions, and known genetic or environmental etiologic factors; patients with Rett syndrome are no longer automatically considered to have a diagnosis of ASD according the DSM-5, although individuals with this neurogenetic disorder may also meet diagnostic criteria for ASD; and specific genetic causes of ASD should be recorded as specifiers for individuals with ASD when identified.

### Multidimensional influences on autism symptom Measures: implications for use in Etiological research [^117KTuc8]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

Growing awareness that symptoms of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) transcend multiple diagnostic categories, and major advances in the identification of genetic syndromes associated with ASD, have led to widespread use of ASD symptom measures in etiologic studies of neurodevelopmental disorders. Insufficient consideration of potentially confounding factors such as cognitive ability or behavior problems can have important negative consequences in interpretation of findings, including erroneous estimation of associations between ASD and etiologic factors.

Method

Participants were 388 children 2 to 13 years old with diagnoses of ASD or another neurodevelopmental disorder without ASD. Receiver operating characteristics methods were used to assess the influence of IQ and emotional and behavioral problems on the discriminative ability of 3 widely used ASD symptom measures: the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS), the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R), and the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS).

Results

IQ influenced the discriminative thresholds of the SRS and ADI-R, and emotional and behavioral problems affected the discriminative thresholds of the SRS, ADI-R, and ADOS. This resulted in low specificity of ASD cutoffs on the SRS and ADI-R for children with intellectual disability without ASD (27–42%) and low specificity across all 3 instruments for children without ASD with increased emotional and behavioral problems (36–59%). Adjustment for these characteristics resulted in improved discriminative ability for all of the ASD measures.

Conclusion

The findings indicate that scores on ASD symptom measures reflect far more than ASD symptoms. Valid interpretation of scores on these measures requires steps to account for the influences of IQ and emotional and behavioral problems.

### Validation of proposed DSM-5 criteria for autism spectrum disorder [^115RBLcB]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

The primary aim of the present study was to evaluate the validity of proposed DSM-5 criteria for autism spectrum disorder (ASD).

Method

We analyzed symptoms from 14,744 siblings (8,911 ASD and 5,863 non-ASD) included in a national registry, the Interactive Autism Network. Youth 2 through 18 years of age were included if at least one child in the family was diagnosed with ASD. Caregivers reported symptoms using the Social Responsiveness Scale and the Social Communication Questionnaire. The structure of autism symptoms was examined using latent variable models that included categories, dimensions, or hybrid models specifying categories and subdimensions. Diagnostic efficiency statistics evaluated the proposed DSM-5 algorithm in identifying ASD.

Results

A hybrid model that included both a category (ASD versus non-ASD) and two symptom dimensions (social communication/interaction and restricted/repetitive behaviors) was more parsimonious than all other models and replicated across measures and subsamples. Empirical classifications from this hybrid model closely mirrored clinical ASD diagnoses (90% overlap), implying a broad ASD category distinct from non-ASD. DSM-5 criteria had superior specificity relative to DSM-IV-TR criteria (0.97 versus 0.86); however sensitivity was lower (0.81 versus 0.95). Relaxing DSM-5 criteria by requiring one less symptom criterion increased sensitivity (0.93 versus 0.81), with minimal reduction in specificity (0.95 versus 0.97).

Conclusions

Results supported the validity of proposed DSM-5 criteria for ASD as provided in Phase I Field Trials criteria. Increased specificity of DSM-5 relative to DSM-IV-TR may reduce false positive diagnoses, a particularly relevant consideration for low base rate clinical settings. Phase II testing of DSM-5 should consider a relaxed algorithm, without which as many as 12% of ASD-affected individuals, particularly females, will be missed. Relaxed DSM-5 criteria may improve identification of ASD, decreasing societal costs through appropriate early diagnosis and maximizing intervention resources.

### Clinical autism subscales have common genetic liabilities that are heritable, pleiotropic, and generalizable to the general population [^111zjyfN]. Translational Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

Across autistic individuals there is extreme variance in these core autistic traits and comorbid symptom domains, manifesting as heterogeneity in clinical presentation. Clinical psychiatry has responded to this heterogeneity by developing numerous psychometric instruments to measure the social communication difficulties, restricted and repetitive behaviors/interests, and motor skills that are clinically relevant to autism. SPARK, a United States-based study of autism with over 270,000 individuals, collects a variety of information from participants, including background history, psychometric instruments, and other phenotypic information through online surveys. In this online setting, several clinically validated autism instruments, including the Social Communication Questionnaire (SCQ), the Repetitive Behavior Scale-Revised (RBS-R), and the Developmental Coordination Disorder Questionnaire (DCDQ), have been completed by thousands of SPARK participants via self-report or parent-report. All three of these instruments and their subscales measure clinically relevant, quantitative traits that have important utility in the diagnosis of autism. Further investigation into the genetic characteristics of these clinical instruments could give insight into their best use cases as well as their potential limitations, potentially illuminating future autism diagnostic strategies and inherent biology.

### Practice parameter for the assessment and treatment of children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorder [^112BHU1S]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2014). Medium credibility.

Autism spectrum disorder clinical presentation and course — age-related features, risks, and prognostic indicators are outlined: preschool children typically present with marked lack of interest in others, restricted patterns of play, and absent social and communicative intent with delays in speech and communication; in children with autism, social and communication skills usually increase by school age but problems with change and various self-stimulatory behaviors may become more prominent; in adolescence, a small number of individuals with autism make marked developmental gains while another subgroup will behaviorally deteriorate; children and adolescents with autism have an increased risk for accidental death; predictors of ultimate outcome include the presence of communicative speech by 5 years of age and overall cognitive ability; and evidence that earlier detection and provision of services improves long-term prognosis makes early diagnosis particularly important.

### The autism symptom dimensions questionnaire: development and psychometric evaluation of a new, open-source measure of autism symptomatology [^111k6HT4]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Aim

To describe the development and initial psychometric evaluation of a new, freely available measure, the Autism Symptom Dimensions Questionnaire (ASDQ).

Method

After development and revision of an initial 33-item version, informants completed a revised 39-item version of the ASDQ on 1467 children and adolescents (aged 2-17years), including 104 with autism spectrum disorder (ASD).

Results

The initial 33-item version of the ASDQ had good reliability and construct validity. However, only four specific symptom factors were identified, potentially due to an insufficient number of items. Factor analyses of the expanded instrument identified a general ASD factor and nine specific symptom factors with good measurement invariance across demographic groups. Scales showed good-to-excellent overall and conditional reliability. Exploratory analyses of predictive validity for ASD versus neurotypical and other developmental disability diagnoses indicated good accuracy for population and at-risk contexts.

Interpretation

The ASDQ is a free and psychometrically sound informant report instrument with good reliability of measurement across a continuous range of scores and preliminary evidence of predictive validity. The measure may be a useful alternative to existing autism symptom measures but further studies with comparison of clinical diagnoses using criterion-standard instruments are needed.

What This Paper Adds

The Autism Symptom Dimensions Questionnaire (ASDQ) is a new, freely available measure of autism symptoms. The ASDQ showed reliable and accurate measurement of autism symptoms. The measure had good screening efficiency for autism spectrum disorder relative to other developmental conditions.

### Clinical genetics evaluation in identifying the etiology of autism spectrum disorders [^117LdmmC]. Genetics in Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

The autism spectrum disorders are a collection of conditions, which have, in common, impaired socialization and communication in association with stereotypic behaviors. The reported incidence of autism spectrum disorders has increased markedly over the past decade. In addition, a large amount of attention has been paid to these conditions among lay and professional groups. These influences have resulted in a marked increase in the number of referrals to clinical geneticists for evaluation of persons with autism spectrum disorders. The primary role of the geneticist in this process is to define etiology, if possible, and to provide counseling and contribute to case management based on the results of such investigations. In deciding upon the appropriate evaluation scheme for a particular patient, the geneticist must consider a host of different factors. Such considerations would include (1) Assuring an accurate diagnosis of autism before proceeding with any investigation. (2) Discussing testing options, diagnostic yields, and patient investment before proceeding with an evaluation. (3) Communication and coordination with the patient's medical home. (4) Assessing the continuously expanding and evolving list of available laboratory testing modalities in light of evidence-based medicine. (5) Recognizing expanded phenotypes of well-described syndromic and metabolic conditions that encompass autism spectrum disorders. (6) Defining an individualized evaluation scheme based on the unique history and clinical features of a given patient. The guidelines in this article have been developed to assist the clinician in the consideration of these factors.

### Practice parameter for the assessment and treatment of children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorder [^116u1wN5]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2014). Medium credibility.

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) — diagnosis and early differential features emphasize DSM-5 criteria and specific preschool behavioral markers. A diagnosis of autism is made when the requisite DSM-5 symptoms are present and other disorders have been adequately ruled out, and less commonly a period of apparently normal development may precede a regression (loss of skills). Developmental language disorders may be mistaken for an ASD, but 2 behaviors at 20 and 42 months — pointing for interest and use of conventional gestures — have been reported to distinguish autistic disorder from language impairment, and at 24 months Autism Diagnostic Interview items emphasizing directing attention (showing) and attention to voice differentiated groups. At 36 months, 4 items correctly classified all subjects — use of other's body, attention to voice, pointing, and finger mannerisms — and from 36 to 61 months children with autism were more likely to show impaired nonverbal behaviors used to regulate social interaction. Diagnostic overlap with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder can occur in childhood, and differentiating childhood schizophrenia from autism may be difficult; however, florid delusions and hallucinations are rarely seen in autism.

### Identification, evaluation, and management of children with autism spectrum disorder [^112Rmg39]. Pediatrics (2020). High credibility.

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) standardized instruments — observation and caregiver-report measures include validated observation tools used to provide structured data to confirm the diagnosis such as the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule, Second Edition (ADOS-2) and the Childhood Autism Rating Scale, Second Edition (CARS-2); no single observation tool is appropriate for all clinical settings, and the observation tool is meant to support application of the DSM-5 criteria informed by history and other data. The ADOS-2 was developed to elicit atypical social language and behaviors, with modules specific for use across the age span of toddlers to adults; it requires intensive training to accurately administer and score and takes 30 to 45 minutes to administer, and the information obtained from the ADOS-2 is used by the clinician with history and functional impairment to determine if the DSM-5 criteria are met. The CARS-2 is another structured approach a clinician might use to support a clinical diagnosis of ASD, with a 15-point scale completed by the clinician based on history and observation. In clinical and research settings, behaviors may also be reported through the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R), a lengthy, semistructured parent interview that supports a knowledgeable clinician in applying diagnostic criteria of ASD, and the SCQ was designed to elicit similar information in an abbreviated questionnaire format. The Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) is a 65-item questionnaire to measure autistic traits on a continuum as part of a more complete evaluation of ASD, and elevated scores may be seen with greater severity of symptoms of ASD as well as with intellectual disability, communication difficulties, and behavioral challenges. The ADOS-2, CARS-2, and SRS (Parent and Teacher) all rate children similarly in approximately half of identified cases.

### Early autism detection: are we ready for routine screening? [^116j5SPz]. Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

BACKGROUND. Autism is a serious neurodevelopmental disorder that has a reportedly rising prevalence rate. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that screening for autism be incorporated into routine practice. It is important to consider the pros and cons of conducting autism screening as part of routine practice and its implications on the community. We have explored this question in the context of screening from a scientific point of view.

Method

A literature search was conducted to assess the effectiveness of community screening programs for autism.

Results

Judged against critical questions about autism, screening programs failed to fulfill most criteria. Good screening tools and efficacious treatment are lacking, and there is no evidence yet that such a program would do more good than harm.

Conclusions

On the basis of the available research, we believe that we do not have enough sound evidence to support the implementation of a routine population-based screening program for autism. Ongoing research in this field is certainly needed, including the development of excellent screening instruments and demonstrating with clinical trials that such programs work and do more good than harm.

The autism spectrum disorders are a collective of conditions that have in common impaired socialization and communication in association with stereotypic behaviors. The reported incidence of autism spectrum disorders has increased dramatically over the past two decades.

### Diagnosis of autism spectrum disorders in the first 3 years of life [^111whUrf]. Nature Clinical Practice: Neurology (2008). Medium credibility.

Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are a class of neurodevelopmental disorders defined by qualitative impairments in social functioning and communication, often accompanied by repetitive and stereotyped patterns of behavior and interests. The term 'ASD' encompasses autism, pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified, and Asperger's syndrome. ASDs show etiologic heterogeneity, and there is no definitive medical test or cure for these conditions. Around 1 in 150 children have an ASD, with males being affected three to four times more frequently than females. The age at diagnosis of ASD ranges from 3 to 6 years, but there is increasing evidence that diagnosis in the second year of life is possible in some children. Early diagnosis will lead to earlier behavior-based intervention, which is associated with improvements in core areas, such as social functioning and communication. Early detection of-and intervention to treat-ASD is crucial because it is likely to lead to an improved outcome.

### Autism [^114QHVCJ]. Lancet (2009). Excellent credibility.

Autism spectrum disorders are characterised by severe deficits in socialisation, communication, and repetitive or unusual behaviours. Increases over time in the frequency of these disorders (to present rates of about 60 cases per 10,000 children) might be attributable to factors such as new administrative classifications, policy and practice changes, and increased awareness. Surveillance and screening strategies for early identification could enable early treatment and improved outcomes. Autism spectrum disorders are highly genetic and multifactorial, with many risk factors acting together. Genes that affect synaptic maturation are implicated, resulting in neurobiological theories focusing on connectivity and neural effects of gene expression. Several treatments might address core and comorbid symptoms. However, not all treatments have been adequately studied. Improved strategies for early identification with phenotypic characteristics and biological markers (eg, electrophysiological changes) might hopefully improve effectiveness of treatment. Further knowledge about early identification, neurobiology of autism, effective treatments, and the effect of this disorder on families is needed.

### MMWR… [^112h2Zko]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Children aged 4 years were classified as having suspected ASD if they did not meet the case definition for ASD but had an evaluator's suspicion of ASD documented in a comprehensive developmental evaluation. Record abstraction was completed for 15 of the 16 sites for 8, 613 children aged 8 years who met the ASD case definition. Of these 8, 613 children, 68. 4% had a documented diagnostic statement of ASD,
67. 3% had a documented autism special education eligibility, and 68. 9% had a documented ASD ICD-9 or ICD-10 code. All three elements of the ASD case definition were present for 34. 6% of children aged 8 years with ASD. Among 5, 292 children aged 8 years with ASD with information on cognitive ability, 39. 6% were classified as having an intellectual disability. Intellectual disability was present among 52. 8% of Black,
50. 0% of AI/AN, 43. 9% of A/PI,
38. 8% of Hispanic, 32. 7% of White, and
31. 2% of multiracial children with ASD. Overall, 66.

5% of children aged 8 years with ASD had a documented autism test. Use of autism tests varied widely across sites:

24. 7% to
93. 5% of children aged 8 years with ASD had a documented autism test in their records. The most common tests documented for children aged 8 years were the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule, Autism Spectrum Rating Scales, Childhood Autism Rating Scale, Gilliam Autism Rating Scale, and Social Responsiveness Scale. Identification by age 48 months was higher among children born in 2018 compared with children born in 2014, suggesting increased early identification consistent with historical patterns. Public Health Action: Increased identification of autism, particularly among very young children and previously underidentified groups, underscores the increased demand and ongoing need for enhanced planning to provide equitable diagnostic, treatment, and support services for all children with ASD.

The substantial variability in ASD identification across sites suggests opportunities to identify and implement successful strategies and practices in communities to ensure all children with ASD reach their potential. Children aged 4 years were classified as having suspected ASD if they did not meet the criteria for ASD but had an evaluator's suspicion of ASD documented in a comprehensive developmental evaluation. Additional demographic information, comprehensive developmental evaluations, individualized education programs, scores from intelligence quotient assessments, and presence of ASD diagnostic tests and assessment tools were collected from records for children. Among children aged 8 years with ASD who had data on cognitive ability, 39. 6% were classified as having intellectual disability at their most recent test or examination,
24. 2% were classified in the borderline range, and 36.

1% were classified in the average or higher range. Age at First Evaluation and ASD Diagnosis Among Children Aged 8 Years Among 7, 227 children aged 8 years with ASD and available evaluations, 50. 3% were evaluated by age 36 months. Among the 5, 887 children aged 8 years with ASD who had an evaluation containing an ASD diagnostic statement, the median age at earliest known diagnosis was 47 months. ASD Testing Among Children Aged 4 and 8 Years Autism testing practices varied among sites, ranging from 24. 7% to
93. 5% of children with ASD aged 8 years having any autism test documented in their records. The most common autism tests were the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (39. 6% overall; range = 10.

### Identification and evaluation of children with autism spectrum disorders [^116TUj19]. Pediatrics (2007). Low credibility.

Autism spectrum disorders are not rare; many primary care pediatricians care for several children with autism spectrum disorders. Pediatricians play an important role in early recognition of autism spectrum disorders, because they usually are the first point of contact for parents. Parents are now much more aware of the early signs of autism spectrum disorders because of frequent coverage in the media; if their child demonstrates any of the published signs, they will most likely raise their concerns to their child's pediatrician. It is important that pediatricians be able to recognize the signs and symptoms of autism spectrum disorders and have a strategy for assessing them systematically. Pediatricians also must be aware of local resources that can assist in making a definitive diagnosis of, and in managing, autism spectrum disorders. The pediatrician must be familiar with developmental, educational, and community resources as well as medical subspecialty clinics. This clinical report is 1 of 2 documents that replace the original American Academy of Pediatrics policy statement and technical report published in 2001. This report addresses background information, including definition, history, epidemiology, diagnostic criteria, early signs, neuropathologic aspects, and etiologic possibilities in autism spectrum disorders. In addition, this report provides an algorithm to help the pediatrician develop a strategy for early identification of children with autism spectrum disorders. The accompanying clinical report addresses the management of children with autism spectrum disorders and follows this report on page 1162 [available at www.pediatrics.org/cgi/content/full/120/5/1162]. Both clinical reports are complemented by the toolkit titled "Autism: Caring for Children With Autism Spectrum Disorders: A Resource Toolkit for Clinicians", which contains screening and surveillance tools, practical forms, tables, and parent handouts to assist the pediatrician in the identification, evaluation, and management of autism spectrum disorders in children.

Recommendations for screening, including early warning signs, and best practices for diagnosis are discussed. Comprehensive evidence based intervention for ASD as well as the findings of the National Standards Project are reviewed. Medication management is also described, as are the roles of other treating professionals.

### Identification, evaluation, and management of children with autism spectrum disorder [^1134vnsp]. Pediatrics (2020). High credibility.

Section 1: Prevalence — definitions, trends, and surveillance emphasizes that "Incidence is the onset of new diagnoses over time in a selected cohort" and "Without consistent longitudinal data in a specified cohort, incidence cannot be determined", so "prevalence is more typically reported than incidence, reflecting rates of ASD in the population at a point in time". The observed increase in reported prevalence "may be attributed to several factors, including broadening in the diagnostic criteria with ongoing revisions of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM)… increased public awareness of the disorder and its symptoms, recommendations for universal screening for ASD… and increased availability of early intervention and school-based services for children with ASD", with partial contribution from "diagnostic substitution", while "A true increase in the prevalence of ASD… is also possible". Geographic patterns note that "Prevalence rates in US populations are similar to those of other industrialized countries, and lower rates are reported in resource-limited countries", and recent data indicate stabilization: "Data on national samples suggest that the prevalence of ASD is stabilizing". Surveillance approaches are summarized: "Surveillance methods include regional, state, and/or national registry systems";

### Practice parameter for the assessment and treatment of children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorder [^115S8m1H]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2014). Medium credibility.

Assessment — Recommendation 2: If the screening indicates significant ASD symptomatology, a thorough diagnostic evaluation should be performed to determine the presence of ASD [CS]. Biological diagnostic markers are not available and diagnosis rests on careful examination of the child, so a standard psychiatric assessment should be followed, including interviews with the child and family and a review of past records and historical information, with the history and examination conducted with careful consideration of DSM-5 diagnostic criteria. The document notes that the diagnosis of autism in infants and very young children is more challenging and that some features may develop later, emphasizes systematic attention to areas relevant to differential diagnosis, and directs that the history include past and current educational and behavioral interventions, family history, relevant psychosocial issues, and consideration of possible comorbid diagnoses.

### Clinical evidence that asperger's disorder is a mild form of autism [^117UH1DP]. Comprehensive Psychiatry (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

The aim of this study is to obtain clinical evidence to test the hypothesis that Asperger's disorder (AD) is a mild form of autism (AU).

Method

A 78-item Likert scale (the RAADS) was administered to 25 adults with AD and 19 with AU (ages, 18–65 years) to assess presence, type, and duration of symptoms.

Results

The following results were found: (a) subjects with AD and AU have similar symptoms throughout adulthood (responses to 72 of 78 questions were not significantly different); (b) subjects with AD had a significantly fewer total number of symptoms; (c) subjects with AD reported nonsignificantly fewer symptoms in the DSM-IV-TR domains of social interaction and repetitive patterns of behavior; and (d) subjects with AD had significantly fewer symptoms in the communication domain.

Conclusions

The data support the hypothesis that AD is a mild form of AU, and that they share a common etiology and developmental neuropathology. It appears warranted in future diagnostic manuals to incorporate AU and AD into 1 diagnostic category such as, "Autism Spectrum Disorder, (with modifiers, severe, moderate, mild, atypical, and Asperger's type)".

### The ASD living biology: from cell proliferation to clinical phenotype [^115aVYcN]. Molecular Psychiatry (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has captured the attention of scientists and clinicians, as well as the lay public, in part because the clinical profile is so striking. Affected individuals may display reduced ability to perceive, and engage in, every day social behaviors; they may display a preoccupation with seemingly trivial aspects of the environment (e.g. a fascination with street signs or spinning objects) and show challenges in expressing themselves verbally. Furthermore, there is considerable heterogeneity in each of those domains. Some individuals with ASD attempt to make friends and have good eye contact, while others appear completely aloof; some have IQs that far exceed normal average, while others are unable to talk. Despite this interest and knowledge about ASD clinical heterogeneity, the prenatal beginning stages of ASD in the vast percentage of affected children are unstudied and unknown. This is because most current approaches are unable to examine the underlying abnormal fetal processes in the child with ASD that lead to that child's clinical and neural outcomes. Thus, the prenatal and early post-natal biological bases for the striking clinical heterogeneity remain largely a mystery and controversial. Without this understanding, "precision" medicine and treatments at the individual child level do not exist in any meaningful way.

### Autism in fragile X syndrome: a category mistake? [^115hUjNh]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

Many investigators now routinely classify children with fragile X syndrome (FXS) according to whether or not they also meet diagnostic criteria for autism. To determine whether this classification is appropriate, we examined the profiles of autistic behaviors shown by boys and girls with FXS.

Method

Individuals with FXS, aged 5 to 25 years, were assessed on two established measures of autism, the Social Communication Questionnaire (SCQ) and the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS).

Results

We found that 35.1% of boys and 4.3% of girls with FXS scored in the "autism" category on both instruments. Analysis of the symptom profile indicated that both boys and girls with FXS showed lower rates of impairment on communication and reciprocal social interaction items than the reference autism samples on the measures. Furthermore, a regression model showed that IQ was significantly negatively associated with the SCQ total score in both boys and girls with FXS, when controlling for age, medication use, and FMRP levels.

Conclusions

These data suggest that there are significant differences in the profile of social and communicative symptomatology in FXS compared with individuals diagnosed with idiopathic autism. Given these differences, the implementation of standard autism interventions for individuals with FXS may not be optimal. Maintaining the conceptual distinction between FXS (an established biological disease) and idiopathic autism (a phenomenologically defined behavioral disorder) may also facilitate the development of more targeted and thus effective interventions for individuals with FXS in the future.

### Finding more constructive ways forward in the debate over vaccines with increased disability cultural competence [^112Jtpaf]. Medical Humanities (2023). Medium credibility.

When speaking of autism, it refers to a broad range of behavioural, language and communication deficits, and issues related to neurodevelopmental dysfunction. In the diagnostic world, autism encompasses a range of symptoms labelled autism spectrum disorders, which include autistic disorder, Asperger's disorder or syndrome and pervasive developmental disorder, not otherwise specified. The diagnoses might sound clear, but the fact is that they are not clear at all, and different doctors might evaluate the symptoms in totally different ways. This is the issue with conditions located in the mind: the symptoms are not easily defined, and they may change over time. Therefore, autism represents a labelling process and a category of knowledge in which the boundaries of symptom inclusion and exclusion are fluid.

Because of the unspecific nature of the condition, autism has come to be the go-to-diagnosis when neurodevelopmental dysfunctions occur in a child. Research indicates that the prevalence of children with autism spectrum disorder has risen dramatically, but mutable disease classification and disease recognition are both central to the observed increase in prevalence rates. Although some disagree, most epidemiologists and clinicians agree that the expanded diagnostic categorisation, greater parental awareness, more refined testing for children, more health professionals trained in diagnosis and referrals for diagnosis and a growing demand for services that can be accessed only through a diagnosis, all contribute to an increased rate of diagnosis. This is an important point with regard to the vaccine-autism controversy and the whole argument of how autism has become an epidemic.

### Quantifying dimensions in autism: a factor-analytic study [^113LYW9b]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective of this study was to determine whether the phenotypic variation in autism and the related pervasive developmental disorders (PDDs) is a unitary construct or whether it is composed of distinct dimensions of autistic symptoms and measures of level of functioning.

Method

One hundred twenty-nine children with autism and other forms of PDD from two samples with different inclusion criteria were assessed with the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales to measure level of functioning and the Autism Diagnostic Interview to measure severity of autistic behaviors. A factor analysis with varimax rotation was performed on each sample, separately and combined.

Results

Two factors emerged; one representing autistic symptoms and another representing level of functioning. The factor structure was remarkably similar and robust to variations in ascertainment and inclusion criteria between the samples. The validity of the distinction was supported by differences between males and females on the symptom factor, but not on the level of functioning factor. IQ was modestly correlated with level of functioning, but not with symptoms.

Conclusions

The phenotypic variation seen in autism/PDD is composed of at least two different dimensions of autistic symptoms and level of functioning. The implications of this dimensional heterogeneity for research, classification, and clinical practice are discussed.

### Frequently asked questions about autism spectrum disorder… [^115hEoRL]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

At a glance Answers to frequently asked questions about autism spectrum disorder. FAQs about ASD Q: Do vaccines cause autism spectrum disorder. A: Many studies have looked at whether there is a relationship between vaccines and ASD. To date, the studies continue to show that vaccines are not associated with ASD. CDC knows some parents and others still have concerns. To address these concerns, CDC is part of the Inter-Agency Autism Coordinating Committee, which is working with the National Vaccine Advisory Committee on this issue. The job of the NVAC is to advise and make recommendations regarding the National Vaccine Program. Communication between the IACC and the NVAC will allow each group to share skills and knowledge, improve coordination, and promote better use of research resources on vaccine topics.

For more information about vaccines and ASD, see the following sites: Immunization Safety Office | CDC

- Measles, Mumps, Rubella Vaccine
- Thimerosal in Flu Vaccine
- **Timeline**: Thimerosal in Vaccines
- Autism and Vaccines. Keep Reading: CDC Studies on Thimerosal in Vaccines Q: Are more children being diagnosed with ASD. A: CDC is working with partners to study the prevalence of ASD over time so we can find out if the number of children with ASD is rising, dropping, or staying the same. The prevalence of ASD among 8-year-olds has increased most years since CDC began tracking ASD in 2000. Prevalence estimates also vary across different communities. Increases between years and differences across sites within a year are likely due to a combination of factors including diagnostic practices and access to services in communities.

Equitable and early identification of ASD is a public health priority so children with ASD can receive services they may need to achieve their full potential. Keep Reading: Data and Statistics on Autism Spectrum Disorder Q: Can adults be diagnosed with ASD. A: Yes, adults can be diagnosed with ASD. Diagnosis includes looking at the person's medical history, watching the person's behavior, and giving the person some psychological tests. But it can be more challenging to diagnose an adult because it is not always possible to know about the person's development during the first few years of life, and a long history of other diagnoses may complicate an ASD diagnosis. Because the focus of ASD research has been on children, we still have much to learn about the prevalence and causes of ASD across the lifespan. Behavioral interventions can be effective for adults coping with a new diagnosis of autism. Q: What are mitochondrial diseases or disorders.

A: Mitochondria are tiny parts of almost every cell in your body. Mitochondria are like the power house of the cells. They turn sugar and oxygen into energy that the cells need to work. In mitochondrial diseases, the mitochondria cannot efficiently turn sugar and oxygen into energy, so the cells do not work correctly. There are many types of mitochondrial disease, and they can affect different parts of the body: the brain, kidneys, muscles, heart, eyes, ears, and others. Mitochondrial diseases can affect one part of the body or can affect many parts. They can affect those parts mildly or very seriously. Not everyone with a mitochondrial disease will show symptoms. However, when discussing the group of mitochondrial diseases that tend to affect children, symptoms usually appear in the toddler and preschool years. Mitochondrial diseases and disorders are the same thing. Q: Is there a relationship between mitochondrial disease and autism.

### The foundations of autistic flourishing [^1128Hgir]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

From Health to Well-Being

The first among these is a need to move from a perspective that says the core to Autistic flourishing is simply conventional "physical and mental health" to one that says it is the far broader notion of "well-being". Autism researchers have largely inherited a medical model that says "physical and mental health" is what matters. They have historically seen autism as a disability in the medical sense: an individual health problem with a biological cause, which requires diagnosing, treating, and fixing. 3 As such, autism research often remains firmly embedded within the conventional medical paradigm — prioritizing a putatively objective standard of "health" over a first-person understanding of "well-being", which is often dismissed as being overly subjective or biased to personal perception. This priority given to the conventional medical model is evidenced by the way autism science routinely seeks to identify the genetic, neurobiological, and cognitive mechanisms that might explain the highly heterogenous behavioral manifestations of autism. Autistic people's behavioral, cognitive, and neural functionings are therefore frequently compared to some typical or "normal" level of ability, cast as an ideal "state of health". Interventions and treatments are designed to be applied to the individual to remediate any apparent shortcomings, bringing Autistic people into line with the accepted norm.

### The many meanings of autism: conceptual and ethical reflections [^112YsFe3]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Autism: Heterogeneous and Polysemous

The heterogeneity of autism is well documented, but is mostly meant to denote differences in behavioural phenotype, suggesting that there are many ways in which an underlying cognitive or biological reality can express itself. 8 But the meaning of the term autism in itself has different layers, and as such 'polysemous' would also be an adequate term to describe autism. Such a polysemic approach to autism acknowledges that autism has many meanings, and that these meanings cannot necessarily be reduced to one another. People from different professions may mean different things when they talk about autism. The diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder is done by the observation of behaviour and on an assessment of dysfunctioning, which is based on how autism spectrum disorder is defined in the DSM‐5, 9 or the International Classification of Diseases‐11th Revision. (Interestingly, other classifications such as Tic disorder do not include the criterion of dysfunctioning, and these diagnoses can in principle be given based on behavioural phenotype alone). Hence, for psychiatrists and child neurologists, a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder is never solely the description of certain behavioural characteristics of an individual; it is always linked to the challenges the individual experiences in his or her life. The diagnosis offers some guidelines as to how to proceed with tackling and alleviating these challenges, and is not solely made on certain characteristics of an individual, a certain kind of social behaviour, or a specific type of information processing. However, when asked what autism actually is, many people, including clinicians, will not only refer to challenging behaviours. 10 They will often refer to a specific way of information processing or sensorial processing that is related to how the brain works, that is innate and has a genetic origin. Such explanations may refer to neurocognitive theories for the specific workings of the autistic mind, including theories positing a deficit in theory of mind, a weak central coherence, or weak executive functioning. 11 More recently, theories have emerged that try to explain the behaviour of autistic persons using models that suggest specific autistic ways of low‐level information processing, or differences in sensorial processing. Examples of these models are enhanced perceptual functioning, 12 intense world syndrome, 13 and high inflexible precision of precision errors. 14 Although the explanatory models are often still used to explain autistic behaviour, and although new theories of autism are still being developed, some autism researchers, such as Happé et al. 15 have suggested that it is perhaps impossible to find one underlying explanation of autistic behaviours.

ASD biomarkers emphasize that objectively measured biological characteristics, or biomarkers, of ASD could potentially be used to predict ASD risk, enhance screening, and permit presymptomatic detection, and their use could improve the reliability and validity of clinical diagnosis, identify mechanisms for developing treatment, and confirm the need for a specific intervention.

### The early origins of autism [^1132x3QV]. Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are neurodevelopmental disorders whose core features of impaired social communication and atypical repetitive behaviors and/or restrictions in range of interests emerge in toddlerhood and carry significant implications at successive stages of development. The ability to reliably identify most cases of the condition far earlier than the average age of diagnosis presents a novel opportunity for early intervention, but the availability of such an intervention is disparate across US communities, and its impact is imperfectly understood. New research may transform the clinical approach to these conditions in early childhood.

### Phenotypic divergence between individuals with self-reported autistic traits and clinically ascertained autism [^116mSc3N]. Nature: Mental Health (2025). High credibility.

While allowing for rapid recruitment of large samples, online research relies heavily on participants' self-reports of neuropsychiatric traits, foregoing the clinical characterizations available in laboratory settings. Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) research is one example for which the clinical validity of such an approach remains elusive. Here we compared 56 adults with ASD recruited in person and evaluated by clinicians to matched samples of adults recruited through an online platform (Prolific; 56 with high autistic traits and 56 with low autistic traits) and evaluated via self-reported surveys. Despite having comparable self-reported autistic traits, the online high-trait group reported significantly more social anxiety and avoidant symptoms than in-person ASD participants. Within the in-person sample, there was no relationship between self-rated and clinician-rated autistic traits, suggesting they may capture different aspects of ASD. The groups also differed in their social tendencies during two decision-making tasks; the in-person ASD group was less perceptive of opportunities for social influence and acted less affiliative toward virtual characters. These findings highlight the need for a differentiation between clinically ascertained and trait-defined samples in autism research.

### Sensitivity and specificity of proposed DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for autism spectrum disorder [^111oo9ny]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

This study evaluated the potential impact of proposed DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for autism spectrum disorder (ASD).

Method

The study focused on a sample of 933 participants evaluated during the DSM-IV field trial; 657 carried a clinical diagnosis of an ASD, and 276 were diagnosed with a non-autistic disorder. Sensitivity and specificity for proposed DSM-5 diagnostic criteria were evaluated using field trial symptom checklists as follows: individual field trial checklist items (e.g., nonverbal communication); checklist items grouped together as described by a single DSM-5 symptom (e.g., nonverbal and verbal communication); individual DSM-5 criterion (e.g., social-communicative impairment); and overall diagnostic criteria.

Results

When applying proposed DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for ASD, 60.6% (95% confidence interval: 57%-64%) of cases with a clinical diagnosis of an ASD met revised DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for ASD. Overall specificity was high, with 94.9% (95% confidence interval: 92%-97%) of individuals accurately excluded from the spectrum. Sensitivity varied by diagnostic subgroup (autistic disorder = 0.76; Asperger's disorder = 0.25; pervasive developmental disorder-not otherwise specified = 0.28) and cognitive ability (IQ < 70 = 0.70; IQ ≥ 70 = 0.46).

Conclusions

Proposed DSM-5 criteria could substantially alter the composition of the autism spectrum. Revised criteria improve specificity but exclude a substantial portion of cognitively able individuals and those with ASDs other than autistic disorder. A more stringent diagnostic rubric holds significant public health ramifications regarding service eligibility and compatibility of historical and future research.

### Patterns of autism symptoms: hidden structure in the ADOS and ADI-R instruments [^116rCeWG]. Translational Psychiatry (2020). Medium credibility.

More generally, the ADI-R and ADOS assessments are often mentioned to be well designed and comprehensive, but not to be particularly efficient to administer in clinical practice. In fact, ~45 min are required for the ADOS assessment, while ~1.5 h are required for the ADI-R assessment. Furthermore, extensive training is needed to use each instrument, which makes the combined assessment very heavy and time-expensive. Berument et al.found that the diagnostic accuracy as well as the estimation of symptom severity based on the ADI was pretty much the same as a 40-item scale, suggesting that a much shorter and highly effective screening instrument can be created. In a similar spirit, our results show that assessing only two domains from the ADI-R assessment may be sufficient for making reliable statements about the rough overall severity of the psychopathology of patients with autism. In sum, although the combination of ADI-R and ADOS assessments has been shown to improve autism diagnostic validity, we found support for a subset highly predictive of symptom severity in a data-guided fashion nevertheless.

### The many meanings of autism: conceptual and ethical reflections [^111TS6HG]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

What implications does such a dynamic view on human nature have for autism and autism ethics? It has been acknowledged that autism can probably not be explained by a simple genetic cause. In most cases, genes that are associated with an autistic phenotype are risk factors. It has been suggested that environmental influences, such as particulate matter due to pollution, may affect the development of autism spectrum disorder. 49 The current understanding that there probably are epigenetic components in its development challenges the predominant view on autism as a neurodevelopmental disorder with a purely genetic basis. 50 Environmental factors, as well as psychosocial factors, directly influence gene expression, and hence resonate on a molecular level, as is shown by recent studies on epigenetics and early childhood trauma. 51 Such acknowledgment of environmental factors in autism also has certain challenges. As I have argued above, if epigenetics is viewed as another (single) causal explanation for autistic behaviour, the search for one specific genetic factor may be substituted by the search for one environmental factor. This may lead to a simplistic attribution of responsibility for autism to a specific individual or to a collective (such as an institution) responsible for a specific environment. Taking epigenetics to be an illustration of a more dynamic and systemic approach to health and pathology would allow us to step away from trying to explain autism by one specific factor to an assessment of the behaviour of an individual with a genetic vulnerability as a meaningful reaction within a given physical and psychosocial context. This may allow for a view on autism that acknowledges the biological realness of the condition. But at the same time such an approach acknowledges that certain genetic atypicalities need not lead to dysfunctioning in every situation or to a 'disordered' phenotype. As a dynamic approach to organisms considers behaviours as meaningful reactions to the environment, this conception also paves the way for an acknowledgment of the importance of autistic experiences, as these can yield important information, both in a clinical context and in research. For example, questions regarding the desirability of early detection and intervention of autism do not need to focus on the early detection of a condition, or a biomarker for a condition, that is solely located in the individual, but can take the approach of looking at the attunement of the individual and context, in constant dialogue with what is meaningful for the individual and their surroundings. 52 For autism research, this approach suggests that in order to understand why certain persons exhibit behaviour that is considered autistic, it may no longer be sufficient to map the behaviour one‐on‐one to a genetic or neurological problem. Rather than seeing behaviours as the upstream results of underlying genes or malfunctioning brains, autism's etiology cannot be properly understood without a reference to what a certain behaviour actually means for an individual in a given context. Hence, this approach may also yield new insights in ethical questions regarding treatment or diagnosis, as it allows for a non‐reductionist interpretation of autism.

### Practice guideline for the treatment of patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder [^117Lg9eG]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2007). Medium credibility.

Autism spectrum comorbidity with obsessive-compulsive disorder — repetitive thoughts and behaviors are common in children and adults with autism or Asperger's syndrome, and one study reported that about 20% of OCD patients have autistic traits. SRIs have been effective for autism-associated repetitive thoughts and behaviors; in two studies with autistic children, clomipramine was more effective than either desipramine or placebo in reducing repetitive and compulsive behaviors, and one controlled study found fluvoxamine to be significantly better than placebo for decreasing repetitive behavior and aggression in adults with autistic disorder. In a randomized controlled trial in children with Asperger's syndrome, CBT reduced obsessive-compulsive symptoms and other forms of anxiety.

### Identifying the lost generation of adults with autism spectrum conditions [^1155BRyj]. The Lancet: Psychiatry (2015). Medium credibility.

Autism spectrum conditions comprise a set of early-onset neurodevelopmental syndromes with a prevalence of 1% across all ages. First diagnosis in adulthood has finally become recognised as an important clinical issue due to the increasing awareness of autism, broadening of diagnostic criteria, and the introduction of the spectrum concept. Thus, the idea of a lost generation of people who were previously excluded from a diagnosis of classic autism has arisen. Making a first diagnosis of autism spectrum conditions in adults can be challenging for practical reasons (eg, no person to provide a developmental history), developmental reasons (eg, the acquisition of learnt or camouflaging strategies), and clinical reasons (eg, high frequency of co-occurring disorders). The diagnostic process includes referral, screening, interviews with informants and patients, and functional assessments. In delineating differential diagnoses, true comorbidities, and overlapping behaviour with other psychiatric diagnoses, particular attention should be paid to anxiety, depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, psychosis, personality disorders, and other neurodevelopmental disorders. Possible misdiagnosis, especially in women, should be explored. The creation of supportive, accepting, and autism-friendly social and physical environments is important and requires a coordinated effort across agencies and needs support from government policies.

### Screening for autism spectrum disorder in young children: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^113fLYDi]. JAMA (2016). Excellent credibility.

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) screening — potential harms, practice suggestions, and current practice: Although there is limited evidence about the harms of screening for ASD in children, reported potential harms include misdiagnosis and the anxiety associated with further testing after a positive screening result, particularly if confirmatory testing is delayed because of resource limitations. Behavioral treatments are not generally thought to be associated with significant harms but can place a large time and financial burden on the family, and other treatments for ASD are less well studied and were not included in this review. It is important that clinicians listen carefully to parents when concerns are raised by the parents or during an examination and make prompt assessment of language skills, joint attention, repetitive movement, and pretend play. A 2004 survey of pediatricians in Maryland and Delaware found that 8% screened specifically for ASD, and more recent surveys have found higher rates, although they remain less than 60%.

### Depressive symptoms are associated with more negative global metacognitive biases in combat veterans, and biases covary with symptom changes over time [^11271dTk]. Depression and Anxiety (2023). Medium credibility.

One reason why metacognitive bias could be more related to depressive symptoms than PTSD symptoms may be the particular tendency in depression to attend to negatively valenced material or have more readily available access to negatively valenced memories (e.g.). For example, one study examining emotional memory biases in an implicit learning task found that only depressive symptoms explained unique variance in a bias to remember negatively valenced adjectives in a joint model with anxiety, ADHD, and autism symptoms. Related to this point, the self-reported cognition measure asked participants to think back about their cognitive abilities over the last 30 days. This long-term memory component is much greater than in trial-by-trial metacognitive awareness studies and could be another reason we found more robust effects between metacognitive bias and depression than the previous studies. Other behaviors cardinal to depression such as rumination and belief inflexibility may further exacerbate these memory biases as depression worsens, forming rigid, global distortions in an individual's abilities and plausibly leading to an overestimation of dysfunction in self-reported functioning.

Social pragmatic communication disorder (SPCD) — a DSM-5 diagnosis — is described as affecting individuals with functionally impairing social language use without habitual or repetitive behaviors. Affected individuals must have "deficits in using language for social purposes", difficulty matching communication to context, following conversational rules, and interpreting idioms and unstated meanings. The text adds that the symptoms "cannot be better explained by another DSM-5 diagnosis", that evaluation by "a speech-language pathologist provides additional information to consider this diagnosis", and that these characteristics and management "require additional study", while noting that ongoing experience will clarify similarities and differences with ASD in etiology, prognosis, and treatment.

DSM-IV-TR autism diagnosis — required domains and onset are specified: under DSM-IV-TR, the diagnosis of autism required disturbances in each of 3 domains — social relatedness, communication/play, and restricted interests and activities — with onset by 3 years of age, and the disturbance in social relatedness includes marked impairment in nonverbal communication, peer relationships, and social-emotional reciprocity.
