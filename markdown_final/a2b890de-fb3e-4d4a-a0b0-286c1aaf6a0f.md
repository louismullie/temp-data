## Question

Metronidazole for Legionella pneumonia

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether metronidazole is an appropriate treatment for Legionella pneumonia, and what the evidence-based alternatives should be if not. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about authoritative guideline recommendations for Legionella therapy. Then, I should verify metronidazole's antimicrobial spectrum and labeled indications. Next, I will consider Legionella's intracellular pathobiology and the pharmacologic rationale for active agents. After that, I should review stewardship principles and any data on resistance patterns and outcomes with macrolides versus fluoroquinolones. Finally, I will synthesize a clear clinical recommendation with dosing and duration consistent with high-credibility sources [^117KRFW6] [^114NQhP1].

> Let me first confirm standard-of-care therapy for Legionella pneumonia, because I need to ensure I anchor on guidelines before making any conclusions. Both the 2019 ATS/IDSA community-acquired pneumonia guidelines and subsequent summaries consistently recommend either a macrolide, particularly azithromycin, or a respiratory fluoroquinolone such as levofloxacin or moxifloxacin for Legionella coverage, including combination with a beta-lactam in severe CAP settings, which immediately suggests metronidazole is not a recommended option [^117KRFW6] [^114NQhP1].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I need to check the pathogen biology to make sure the pharmacologic rationale fits. Legionella pneumophila is a facultative intracellular pathogen that requires antibiotics with robust intracellular activity, a property well described for macrolides and respiratory fluoroquinolones, whereas there is no corresponding role for metronidazole in this context based on the intracellular lifecycle of the organism and clinical practice standards [^117G9rqS] [^112GuinS].

> Wait, let me verify metronidazole's actual labeled uses and spectrum so I do not attribute activity it does not have. The FDA SPLs consistently indicate metronidazole for anaerobic bacterial infections and select protozoal diseases and do not list Legionella or aerobic gram-negative respiratory pathogens as targets, reinforcing that metronidazole lacks an evidence-based role for Legionella pneumonia [^116pkJ49] [^111D1X5q] [^111px5kP] [^112HKVoW].

> I should double-check whether any clinical trials or guidance even mention metronidazole for Legionella, because absence of evidence is not always evidence of absence. Scanning guideline recommendations and clinical reviews shows no endorsement of metronidazole for Legionella, and recommended empiric regimens that include atypical coverage are centered on macrolides or fluoroquinolones, not nitroimidazoles, aligning practice away from metronidazole for this indication [^113YejwN] [^114dGdnT] [^114NQhP1].

> Next, I should review outcomes data comparing macrolides and fluoroquinolones to ensure there is not a hidden signal suggesting alternative agents. Observational and meta-analytic data demonstrate similar mortality between macrolides and fluoroquinolones for Legionella pneumonia, supporting either class as appropriate choices and again not implicating metronidazole as a therapeutic option for this pathogen [^115targL] [^114eApR7].

> Let me consider resistance patterns and contingency plans, because therapeutic gaps could tempt off-label choices. Even with emerging azithromycin resistance concerns in some laboratory or genomic contexts, recommended alternatives remain within the respiratory fluoroquinolone class, and none of these resistance discussions pivot to metronidazole for Legionella, which is consistent with its lack of activity in this disease state [^117PiaKL] [^117KRFW6].

> I will now examine concrete, label-supported dosing to give a practical, guideline-concordant pathway. For Legionella pneumonia, azithromycin 500 mg IV daily with step-down to 500 mg PO daily to complete 7–10 days, or oral azithromycin 500 mg daily for at least 5 days, is supported by FDA labeling and clinical experience, while levofloxacin 750 mg IV/PO daily for 5–10 days, or 500 mg IV/PO daily for 7–14 days, is also label-supported for CAP due to Legionella, with ICU-level CAP often managed as beta-lactam plus azithromycin or monotherapy with a respiratory fluoroquinolone per guidelines [^112FxvLN] [^113xXLZv] [^117JZqN7] [^116UeeB8] [^116AsBRF] [^116mcFFM] [^117KRFW6].

> Hmm, wait a minute, could metronidazole have a role if there is aspiration or polymicrobial pneumonia where anaerobes are suspected; I need to ensure I am not overgeneralizing. It is reasonable to add metronidazole for proven or strongly suspected anaerobic infection in another compartment, but that would be to treat anaerobes specifically and would not substitute for Legionella-active therapy, so even in mixed infections one must still include azithromycin or a respiratory fluoroquinolone for Legionella coverage [^116pkJ49] [^117KRFW6] [^114NQhP1].

> Let me synthesize and be explicit with the recommendation, because therapeutic clarity matters here. Metronidazole is not appropriate for the treatment of Legionella pneumonia, given its anaerobe- and protozoa-focused spectrum and the absence of guideline or label support, while macrolides or respiratory fluoroquinolones remain the evidence-based standards; therefore, initiate azithromycin or a respiratory fluoroquinolone per ATS/IDSA guidance and FDA labeling and avoid metronidazole for this indication [^116pkJ49] [^117KRFW6] [^114NQhP1] [^112FxvLN] [^116UeeB8].

Metronidazole is **ineffective for Legionella pneumonia** because it has no activity against Legionella species, aerobic intracellular bacteria [^117G9rqS]. The recommended first-line treatments are **fluoroquinolones** (e.g. levofloxacin) [^116mcFFM] [^114NQhP1] or **macrolides** (e.g. azithromycin) [^1116XZgB], which have demonstrated efficacy and intracellular penetration [^114eApR7] [^114hgaXj]. Metronidazole should not be used for Legionella pneumonia; it is reserved for anaerobic or protozoal infections [^116pkJ49].

---

## Pharmacological properties of metronidazole

Metronidazole is a nitroimidazole antibiotic with **activity against anaerobic bacteria and protozoa** [^111D1X5q]. Its mechanism involves reduction of the nitro group under anaerobic conditions, generating reactive intermediates that damage DNA and lead to cell death [^116pkJ49]. This activity is limited to anaerobic or microaerophilic organisms because aerobic bacteria lack the enzymes needed for nitro group reduction [^112HKVoW].

---

## Legionella pneumophila: microbiological characteristics

Legionella pneumophila is a Gram-negative, aerobic, facultative intracellular bacterium that replicates within macrophages and amoebae [^113WuBa9]. It **requires antibiotics with intracellular penetration** and activity in aerobic environments [^117G9rqS]. Standard treatments include fluoroquinolones (e.g. levofloxacin) and macrolides (e.g. azithromycin) [^114NQhP1], which have demonstrated efficacy in clinical studies [^114eApR7] [^114hgaXj].

---

## Clinical evidence regarding metronidazole and Legionella pneumonia

There is **no clinical evidence** supporting metronidazole in Legionella pneumonia [^113WuBa9]. Metronidazole lacks activity against aerobic bacteria, including Legionella species, and is not recommended by guidelines or expert consensus [^111D1X5q] [^114NQhP1] [^114eApR7]. The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and American Thoracic Society (ATS) guidelines recommend fluoroquinolones or macrolides as first-line therapy for Legionella pneumonia and do not mention metronidazole [^117KRFW6].

---

## Comparative effectiveness of metronidazole versus standard treatments

No **clinical trials** or studies have compared metronidazole with standard treatments (fluoroquinolones or macrolides) for Legionella pneumonia. Metronidazole's lack of activity against Legionella precludes its use as an alternative or adjunctive therapy. In contrast, fluoroquinolones and macrolides have demonstrated efficacy [^114eApR7], with fluoroquinolones associated with faster clinical improvement and shorter hospital stays [^1168jy1B].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations **consistently advise against metronidazole** for Legionella pneumonia [^114NQhP1]. The IDSA/ATS guidelines recommend fluoroquinolones or macrolides as first-line therapy and do not mention metronidazole [^117KRFW6]. Expert reviews and clinical studies emphasize the importance of antibiotics with intracellular activity, such as fluoroquinolones and macrolides, for effective treatment of Legionella pneumonia [^117G9rqS] [^114eApR7] [^114hgaXj].

---

## Potential risks and adverse effects of metronidazole

Metronidazole carries risks and adverse effects, including gastrointestinal disturbances, neurotoxicity, and hematologic abnormalities [^111D1X5q]. These risks **outweigh any potential benefit**, given its lack of activity against Legionella species. Additionally, inappropriate use of metronidazole may contribute to antibiotic resistance and adverse clinical outcomes [^116dQnL5].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Metronidazole is **ineffective for Legionella pneumonia** because it lacks activity against aerobic bacteria [^116pkJ49]. Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations consistently advise against its use [^114NQhP1]. Fluoroquinolones or macrolides remain the recommended first-line treatments for Legionella pneumonia, while metronidazole should be reserved for anaerobic or protozoal infections — not for Legionella pneumonia [^113WuBa9].

### Are fluoroquinolones or macrolides better for treating Legionella pneumonia? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^114eApR7]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Low credibility.

The Infectious Diseases Society of America recommends either a fluoroquinolone or a macrolide as a first-line antibiotic treatment for Legionella pneumonia. However, it remains unclear which antibiotic leads to optimal clinical outcomes. We compared the effectiveness of fluoroquinolone versus macrolide monotherapy in Legionella pneumonia using a systematic review and meta-analysis.

- **Methods**: We conducted a systematic search of literature in PubMed, Cochrane, Scopus, and Web of Science from inception to 1 June 2019. Randomized controlled trials and observational studies comparing macrolide with fluoroquinolone monotherapy, using clinical outcomes in patients with Legionella pneumonia, were included. Twenty-one publications out of an initial 2073 unique records met the selection criteria. Following PRISMA guidelines, two reviewers participated in data extraction. The primary outcome was mortality. Secondary outcomes included clinical cure, time to apyrexia, length of hospital stay (LOS), and the occurrence of complications. The review and meta-analysis was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42019132901).

- **Results**: Twenty-one publications with 3525 patients met inclusion criteria. The mean age of the population was 60.9 years and 67.2% were men. The mortality rate for patients treated with fluoroquinolones was 6.9% (104/1512) compared with 7.4% (133/1790) among those treated with macrolides. The pooled odds ratio assessing the risk of mortality for patients treated with fluoroquinolones versus macrolides was 0.94 (95% confidence interval, .71–1.25, I² = 0%, P = 0.661).

### Azithromycin in the treatment of Legionella pneumonia requiring hospitalization [^114hgaXj]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

Azithromycin is highly active against Legionella pneumophila and has been shown to be efficacious in animal models and in clinical studies of patients with Legionnaires' disease. This open, prospective, multicenter trial evaluated azithromycin for the treatment of Legionnaires' disease.

- **Patient information**: Twenty-five hospitalized patients with community-acquired pneumonia and a positive result of an L. pneumophila serogroup 1 urinary antigen assay received monotherapy with intravenous azithromycin (500 mg/day) for 2–7 days, followed by oral azithromycin (1500 mg administered over the course of 3 or 5 days).

- **Duration of therapy**: The mean total duration of intravenous plus oral therapy was 7.92 days.

- **Cure rate**: The overall cure rate among clinically evaluable patients was 95% (20 of 21 patients) at 10–14 days after therapy and 96% (22 of 23 patients) at 4–6 weeks after therapy.

The results of this study support previously reported data demonstrating that azithromycin is both safe and efficacious for the treatment of hospitalized patients with Legionnaires' disease.

### Weather-dependent risk for Legionnaires' disease, United States [^117Ef1g6]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

The antimicrobial drugs most commonly used to treat LD include either a fluoroquinolone or a macrolide (with a β-lactam), and resistance has increased for both. Thus, treating for LD only when and where risk is higher, along with increased diagnostic testing and good clinical judgment, may help reduce antimicrobial drug use, providing a new antimicrobial drug stewardship target. The temporal, climatologic, and geographic variations in LD risk emphasize the potential importance of regionally relevant guidelines. Basing treatment guidelines on estimates in high- or low-risk areas will lead to overuse or underuse of LD treatment for CAP. However, future work with more detailed clinical information is required to determine when and where antimicrobial drug use may be initially restricted and in which patients, without significantly impairing the quality of care. Specifically, future work will need to determine under which conditions and in which patients initial monotherapy with a β-lactam will not be inferior to combination therapy. Furthermore, future work will need to consider and incorporate diagnostic testing for LD and the patient's clinical status (e.g. intensive care unit admission).

### Diagnosis and management of community-acquired pneumonia in adults [^112ZbpHr]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia is diagnosed by clinical features such as cough, fever, and pleuritic chest pain, alongside lung imaging, typically showing an infiltrate on chest radiography. Initial evaluation should ascertain whether hospitalization or outpatient management is necessary, using validated mortality or severity prediction scores. Selected diagnostic laboratory tests, like sputum and blood cultures, are indicated for inpatients with severe illness but are rarely useful for outpatients.

Initial outpatient therapy should include a macrolide or doxycycline. For outpatients with comorbidities or those who have used antibiotics within the previous three months, a respiratory fluoroquinolone (levofloxacin, gemifloxacin, or moxifloxacin), or an oral beta-lactam antibiotic plus a macrolide should be considered. Inpatients not admitted to an intensive care unit should receive a respiratory fluoroquinolone or a beta-lactam antibiotic plus a macrolide.

Patients with severe community-acquired pneumonia or those admitted to the intensive care unit should be treated with a beta-lactam antibiotic, plus azithromycin or a respiratory fluoroquinolone. Those with risk factors for Pseudomonas should be treated with a beta-lactam antibiotic (piperacillin/tazobactam, imipenem/cilastatin, meropenem, doripenem, or cefepime), plus an aminoglycoside and azithromycin or an antipseudomonal fluoroquinolone (levofloxacin or ciprofloxacin). Patients with risk factors for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus should be administered vancomycin or linezolid. Hospitalized patients may be transitioned from intravenous to oral antibiotics based on clinical status and improvement.

### Antimicrobial therapy for legionnaire's disease: Antibiotic stewardship implications [^113dkN6f]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Legionnaire's disease is a common cause of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Although no single clinical feature is diagnostic, a presumptive clinical syndromic diagnosis is possible if characteristic extrapulmonary findings are present. Depending on geographic location, season, and physician awareness, Legionnaire's disease may be included in the differential diagnosis of CAP.

Some antibiotics effective against Legionella species are also effective in treating the typical bacterial causes of CAP. From an antimicrobial stewardship program (ASP) perspective, monotherapy is preferred to double-drug therapy. From an ASP and pharmacoeconomic standpoint, monotherapy with doxycycline or a respiratory quinolone provides optimal cost-effective therapy.

### Distribution characteristics of the CRISPR-Cas system and its regulatory mechanism underpinning phenotypic function [^117PiaKL]. Infection and Immunity (2024). Low credibility.

Legionella is a common intracellular parasitic bacterium that infects humans via the respiratory tract, causing Legionnaires' disease, with fever and pneumonia as the main symptoms. The emergence of highly virulent and azithromycin-resistant Legionella pneumophila is a major challenge in clinical anti-infective therapy. The CRISPR-Cas acquired immune system provides immune defense against foreign nucleic acids and regulates strain biological functions. However, the distribution of the CRISPR-Cas system in Legionella and how it regulates gene expression in L. pneumophila remain unclear.

Herein, we assessed 915 Legionella whole-genome sequences to determine the distribution characteristics of the CRISPR-Cas system and constructed gene deletion mutants to explore the regulation of the system based on growth ability in vitro, antibiotic sensitivity, and intracellular proliferation of L. pneumophila. The CRISPR-Cas system in Legionella was predominantly Type II-B and was mainly concentrated in the genome of L. pneumophila ST1 strains. The Type II-B CRISPR-Cas system showed no effect on the strain's growth ability in vitro but significantly reduced resistance to azithromycin and decreased proliferation ability due to regulation of the lpeAB efflux pump and the Dot/Icm type IV secretion system.

Thus, the Type II-B CRISPR-Cas system plays a crucial role in regulating the virulence of L. pneumophila. This expands our understanding of drug resistance and pathogenicity in Legionella, providing a scientific basis for the prevention of Legionnaires' disease outbreaks.

### Legionella pneumonia due to non-Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1: Usefulness of the six-point scoring system [^115Vvh46]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Legionella pneumonia is a type of pulmonary infection caused by Gram-negative bacilli and is an important cause of severe community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). The most frequently identified causative pathogen of Legionella pneumonia is Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1, probably because it can be quickly diagnosed by the urinary antigen test. However, about 20% of Legionella pneumonia cases due to non-L. pneumophila serogroup 1 are diagnosed not by the urinary antigen test but by culture using Wadowsky-Yee-Okuda (WYO)-α or Buffered Charcoal Yeast Extract (BCYE)-α medium. Legionella pneumonia due to non-L. pneumophila serogroup 1 can be both severe and mild to moderate.

At the time of writing, there have been few reports that summarized the clinical characteristics of such cases, including symptoms, laboratory findings, radiologic findings, pneumonia severity, treatment, and prognosis. To predict the probability of Legionella pneumonia, Fiumefreddo et al. proposed a six-point scoring system using dichotomized routine clinical and laboratory variables. Haubitz et al. validated the usefulness of this scoring system using a large multinational database. However, to our knowledge, there are no reports evaluating the usefulness of this scoring system in predicting non-L. pneumophila serogroup 1 Legionella pneumonia. This study aimed to investigate the clinical characteristics of Legionella pneumonia due to non-L. pneumophila serogroup 1 and the usefulness of the six-point scoring system in predicting such cases compared with those of L. pneumophila serogroup 1.

### Community-acquired pneumonia in adults: Rapid evidence review [^116EUyQ5]. American Family Physician (2022). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of community-acquired pneumonia, specifically in the context of empiric antibiotic therapy for patients in an outpatient setting without comorbidities, the AAFP 2022 guidelines recommend administering high-dose amoxicillin, doxycycline, or a macrolide. The use of a macrolide is advised only if local macrolide resistance rates for pneumococcus are below 25% for empiric antibiotic therapy in adult outpatients with CAP who do not have comorbid conditions.

### Azithromycin [^117JZqN7]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

In a controlled trial of community-acquired pneumonia performed in the US, azithromycin (500 mg as a single daily dose by the intravenous route for 2 to 5 days, followed by 500 mg/day by the oral route to complete 7 to 10 days of therapy) was compared to cefuroxime (2,250 mg/day in three divided doses by the intravenous route for 2 to 5 days, followed by 1,000 mg/day in two divided doses by the oral route to complete 7 to 10 days of therapy), with or without erythromycin. For the 291 patients who were evaluable for clinical efficacy, the clinical outcome rates, i.e. cure, improved, and success (cure + improved) among the 277 patients seen at 10 to 14 days post-therapy were as follows:

In a separate, uncontrolled clinical and microbiological trial performed in the US, 94 patients with community-acquired pneumonia who received azithromycin in the same regimen were evaluable for clinical efficacy. The clinical outcome rates, i.e. cure, improved, and success (cure + improved) among the 84 patients seen at 10 to 14 days post-therapy were as follows:

Microbiological determinations in both trials were made at the pre-treatment visit and, where applicable, were reassessed at later visits. Serological testing was done on baseline and final visit specimens. The following combined presumptive bacteriological eradication rates were obtained from the evaluable groups.

- **Combined bacteriological eradication rates for azithromycin**: The presumed bacteriological outcomes at 10 to 14 days post-therapy for patients treated with azithromycin were documented.

### Diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia. An official clinical practice guideline of the American Thoracic Society and Infectious Diseases Society of America [^117KRFW6]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for community-acquired pneumonia, more specifically with respect to empiric antibiotic therapy in the outpatient setting for patients with comorbidities, ATS/IDSA 2019 guidelines recommend administering a combination therapy of a β-lactam (such as amoxicillin/clavulanate, cefpodoxime, or cefuroxime) and doxycycline 100 mg PO BID as another option.

### Severe pneumonia caused by Legionella pneumophila: Differential diagnosis and therapeutic considerations [^117G9rqS]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Severe Legionella pneumonia poses a diagnostic challenge and requires early intervention. Legionnaire's disease can have several presenting signs, symptoms, and laboratory abnormalities that suggest Legionella pneumophila is the pathogen, but none of these are sufficient to distinguish L. pneumophila pneumonia from other respiratory pathogens. L. pneumophila is primarily an intracellular pathogen and requires treatment with antibiotics that efficiently enter the intracellular space.

### Legionella pneumonia due to non-Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1: Usefulness of the six-point scoring system [^114Ltqnh]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Because of a limited number of reports, we aimed to investigate the clinical characteristics of patients with Legionella pneumonia due to non-Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1 and the diagnostic usefulness of the six-point scoring system for such patients compared with patients with pneumonia caused by L. pneumophila serogroup 1.

- **Methods**: We retrospectively analyzed patients diagnosed with Legionella pneumonia due to non-L. pneumophila serogroup 1 between March 2001 and June 2016. We examined the clinical characteristics, including symptoms, laboratory findings, radiologic findings, pneumonia severity, initial treatment, and prognosis. We also calculated scores using the six-point scoring system in these patients. Furthermore, we compared the clinical characteristics and six-point scores between non-L. pneumophila serogroup 1 patients and L. pneumophila serogroup 1 patients among hospitalized community-acquired pneumonia patients enrolled prospectively between October 2010 and July 2016.

- **Results**: Eleven patients had pneumonia due to non-L. pneumophila serogroup 1; their median age was 66 years, and 8 patients (72.7%) were male. The most common pathogen was L. pneumophila serogroup 3 (6/11), followed by L. pneumophila serogroup 9 (3/11), L. pneumophila serogroup 6 (1/11), and L. longbeachae (1/11). Non-specific symptoms, such as fever and cough, were common. Six patients (54.5%) had liver enzyme elevation, but no patient developed hyponatremia at < 130 mEq/L. Nine patients (81.8%) showed lobar pneumonia, and 7 patients (63.6%) manifested with consolidation.

### Risk factors, management, and outcomes of legionella pneumonia in a large, nationally representative sample [^1127AqX9]. Chest (2021). Low credibility.

American Thoracic Society/Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines recommend against routine Legionella pneumophila testing, but recommend that hospitalized patients with community-acquired pneumonia receive empiric treatment covering Legionella. Testing, empiric treatment, and outcomes for patients with Legionella have not been well described.

- **Research question**: Is testing for Legionella pneumophila appropriate, and could it impact treatment?

- **Study design and methods**: We conducted a large retrospective cohort analysis using Premier Healthcare Database data from 2010 to 2015. We included adults with a principal diagnosis code for pneumonia (or a principal diagnosis of respiratory failure or sepsis with secondary diagnosis of pneumonia) if they also received treatment for pneumonia on hospital days 1–3. We categorized Legionella-tested patients by test result, identified patient characteristics associated with testing and test result, and examined seasonal and regional patterns of Legionella pneumonia (LP) diagnoses. Empiric therapy for LP was defined as a macrolide, quinolone, or doxycycline, administered on each of the first two hospital days.

- **Results**: Of 166,689 eligible patients, 43,070 (26%) were tested for Legionella, and 642 (1.5%) tested positive. Although only 36% of tests were ordered from June to October, 70% of positive test results occurred during this time. Only 30% of patients with hyponatremia, 32% with diarrhea, and 27% in the ICU were tested. Of patients with positive test results, 495 of 642 (77%) had received empiric Legionella therapy.

### Empiric antibiotic coverage of atypical pathogens for community acquired pneumonia in hospitalized adults [^113YejwN]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2005). High credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is caused by various pathogens, traditionally classified as 'typical' and 'atypical' Initial antibiotic treatment of CAP is usually empirical, typically covering both pathogen types. At the time of writing, no sufficient evidence exists to support this broad coverage. Limiting coverage could reduce toxicity, resistance, and expense.

- **Objectives**: Assess the efficacy and need for adding antibiotic coverage for atypical pathogens in hospitalized patients with CAP, in terms of mortality and successful treatment.

- **Search strategy**: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library Issue 1, 2005), including the Acute Respiratory Infection Group's specialized register; MEDLINE (January 1966 to January Week 2, 2005); and EMBASE (January 1980 to January Week 2, 2005).

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized trials of adult patients hospitalized due to CAP, comparing antibiotic regimens with atypical antibiotic coverage to regimens without such coverage.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two reviewers independently appraised the quality of each trial and extracted data from included trials. Relative risks (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated, assuming an intention-to-treat (ITT) basis for the outcome measures.

- **Main results**: Twenty-four trials were included, encompassing 5015 randomized patients. There was no difference in mortality between the atypical arm and the non-atypical arm (RR 1.13; 95% CI 0.82 to 1.54). The atypical arm showed an insignificant trend.

### 2019 community-acquired pneumonia treatment guidelines: There is a need for a change toward more parsimonious antibiotic use [^114NCFtS]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

In the United States, 6 in 10 adults have one chronic disease, and 4 in 10 adults have two or more chronic diseases, so the recommendation for amoxicillin will be applicable to a minority of adults with CAP. Therefore, U.S. physicians will most likely continue to treat many patients with the Watch group respiratory fluoroquinolones, a class of antibiotics with a well-documented propensity to favor the emergence and spread of antibiotic resistance and Clostridioides difficile infections, as well as an increased risk of adverse events [US Food and Drug Administration alert].

This will hamper the CDC's efforts to reduce overall antibiotic consumption and fluoroquinolone use in the United States. The Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee also suggested that guidelines should include recommendations to educate patients about antibiotic therapy when appropriate. Accordingly, the developers of the CAP guidelines could have considered providing guidance to physicians regarding the use of Access group antibiotics such as amoxicillin and doxycycline in select patients with stable comorbid conditions, along with close monitoring and adequate patient education.

Even more surprising is the listing of the Reserve group fifth-generation cephalosporin ceftaroline as a first-choice empiric treatment option for CAP (in combination with a macrolide) in hospitalized adults without risk factors for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Efficacy data from phase III trials suggesting that ceftaroline is superior to ceftriaxone with regard to treating these infections.

Regarding the medical management of community-acquired pneumonia, specifically concerning empiric antibiotic therapy for outpatients without comorbidities, the ATS/IDSA 2019 guidelines recommend administering a macrolide. This includes azithromycin 500 mg PO on the first day followed by 250 mg daily, clarithromycin 500 mg PO BID, or clarithromycin extended-release 1,000 mg PO daily, in areas where pneumococcal resistance to macrolides is less than 25%.

### Severe pneumonia due to concurrent Legionella pneumophila and Acinetobacter baumannii infections: a case report [^111tCuHz]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

Legionella pneumophila is an uncommon pathogen causing community-acquired atypical pneumonia. Acinetobacter baumannii is a major pathogen responsible for hospital-acquired pneumonia, but it rarely causes serious infections in a community setting. Without prompt and appropriate treatment, infection from either of these two pathogens can cause a high mortality rate. ConInfection from both L. pneumophila and A. baumannii can cause serious outcomes, but it has rarely been reported previously.

- **Case presentation**: A 45-year-old male presented to our hospital with a productive cough and fever after staying in a local hotel. His chest computed tomography (CT) scan showed bilateral lower-lobe infiltration and left pleural effusion. Empirical antibiotics, including piperacillin-tazobactam, levofloxacin, meropenem, and doxycycline, were administered to treat community-acquired pneumonia. However, his condition deteriorated very rapidly, and he required endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation for respiratory support. Metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) of his bronchoalveolar lavage fluid identified L. pneumophila and A. baumannii. The sputum culture demonstrated multidrug-resistant A. baumannii. He was diagnosed with pneumonia by coinfections from both L. pneumophila and A. baumannii. After careful consideration of the antibiotic susceptibility results and the antibacterial mechanism of each antibiotic, the treatment was switched to omadacycline and cefoperazone/sulbactam. His clinical symptoms gradually subsided.

### Review of treatment guidelines for community-acquired pneumonia [^111wTGxs]. The American Journal of Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a costly disease associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The growing prevalence of this disease has led to various advances in diagnosis and treatment. The most common pathogens of CAP include Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and atypical pathogens; however, the underlying pathogen often remains unknown. Treatment of CAP has evolved due to changing etiologic patterns and increasing antimicrobial resistance among common respiratory pathogens.

- **Organizations involved**: Among the groups that have established treatment guidelines for CAP are the American Thoracic Society (ATS), the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA), and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

- **Guideline focus**: These guidelines establish risk factors associated with drug resistance or infection with specific pathogens. Each guideline provides unique recommendations that are similar in some ways, yet different in others.

By understanding the various risk factors for drug resistance and the treatment options endorsed by these guidelines, physicians can treat patients with the most appropriate antimicrobial available.

### Pneumococcal and legionella urinary antigen tests in community-acquired pneumonia: Prospective evaluation of indications for testing [^117VjPdd]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Low credibility.

Adult, community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) guidelines from the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and American Thoracic Society (ATS) include indications for urinary antigen tests (UATs) for Streptococcus pneumoniae (SP) and Legionella pneumophila (LP). These recommendations were based on expert opinions and have not been rigorously evaluated.

- **Methods**: We used data from a multicenter, prospective surveillance study of adults hospitalized with CAP to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of the IDSA/ATS UAT indications for identifying patients who test positive. SP and LP UATs were completed on all included patients. Separate analyses were conducted for SP and LP, using two-by-two contingency tables, comparing the IDSA/ATS indications (UAT recommended vs not recommended) and UAT results (positive vs negative). Additionally, logistic regression was used to evaluate the association of each individual criterion in the IDSA/ATS indications with positive UAT results.

- **Results**: Among 1,941 patients, UATs were positive for SP in 81 (4.2%) and for LP in 32 (1.6%). IDSA/ATS indications had 61% sensitivity (95% confidence interval [CI] 49–71%) and 39% specificity (95% CI 37–41%) for SP, and 63% sensitivity (95% CI 44–79%) and 35% specificity (95% CI 33–37%) for LP. No clinical characteristics were strongly associated with positive SP UATs, while features associated with positive LP UATs were hyponatremia, fever, diarrhea, and recent travel.

- **Conclusions**: Recommended indications for SP and LP urinary antigen testing in the IDSA/ATS CAP guidelines have poor sensitivity and specificity for identifying patients with positive UAT results.

### An update on legionella [^114BQbxJ]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

The purpose of this review is to highlight that *Legionella pneumophila* is increasingly recognized as a significant cause of both sporadic and epidemic community-acquired as well as nosocomial-acquired pneumonia. The review focuses on the latest literature concerning the epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and treatment of Legionnaires' disease.

Recent findings demonstrate a significant increase in the incidence of Legionnaires' disease in the United States over the past few years. *L. pneumophila* has recently been identified as a leading cause of community-acquired pneumonia in hospitalized and ambulatory patients in Germany. Recent studies provide important insights into the understanding of the pathogenesis of Legionnaires' disease, particularly the relevance of biofilm formation. Clinical manifestations of Legionnaires' disease are not specific, and diagnostic scores are of limited use. Several recent studies have offered valuable information concerning Legionnaires' disease in immunosuppressed patients. A systematic review of English-language literature conducted to assess test characteristics of the Legionella urinary antigen has found that the pooled sensitivity of the test is 0.74, and specificity is 0.991. An improved clinical response has been observed for patients with Legionnaires' disease treated with highly active antimicrobial agents against Legionella.

In summary, Legionnaires' disease remains a significant health problem in many countries. Since clinical manifestations are unreliable in diagnosing Legionnaires' disease, diagnostic laboratory tests for Legionella, including the urinary antigen test, are essential.

### Is activity against "atypical" pathogens necessary in the treatment protocols for community-acquired pneumonia? Issues with combination therapy [^115HnUNv]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

The "atypical pathogens" reviewed include Legionella pneumophila, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Urinary antigen tests are the most frequently used tests for Legionella species and show good specificity and reasonable sensitivity. For M. pneumoniae, detection of immunoglobulin M, used for the past decade, has substantially improved diagnostic specificity and has simplified testing. For C. pneumoniae, there is no consensus on a simplified test that can be commonly used, and the reported results with the use of tests that have not been well validated for diagnostic accuracy show great variation in prevalence.

In regard to therapeutic trials, three meta-analyses have recently addressed the issue of clinical outcomes with or without antibiotics directed against atypical pathogens (macrolides or fluoroquinolones vs. beta-lactam agents). These analyses have not been able to demonstrate any clinical benefit, except in a subset analysis of infections caused by L. pneumophila. Nevertheless, multiple studies from the 1950s and 1960s supported a clinical benefit of tetracycline or erythromycin treatment for infections caused by M. pneumoniae.

The largest uncontrolled review of antibiotic treatment for hospitalized patients with community-acquired pneumonia demonstrated a clear benefit from the use of macrolides plus cephalosporins or fluoroquinolones, compared with the use of beta-lactams alone. Although these data support a potential role for atypical agents, other potential explanations make drawing conclusions difficult.

### Bismuth subsalicylate/metronidazole/tetracycline hydrochloride [^117Nooa3]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2019). Low credibility.

- **Development of superinfections**: Known or previously unrecognized candidiasis may present more prominent symptoms during therapy with metronidazole and requires treatment with an antifungal agent. As with other antibiotics, use of tetracycline hydrochloride may result in the overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms, including fungi. If superinfection occurs, discontinue bismuth subsalicylate chewable tablets, metronidazole tablets, and tetracycline hydrochloride capsules, and institute appropriate therapy.

- **Photosensitivity**: Photosensitivity, manifested by an exaggerated sunburn reaction, has been observed in some individuals taking tetracyclines (see adverse reactions). Patients likely to be exposed to direct sunlight or ultraviolet light should be advised that this reaction can occur with tetracycline drugs. Instruct patients taking bismuth subsalicylate chewable tablets, metronidazole tablets, and tetracycline hydrochloride capsules to avoid exposure to the sun or sun lamps. Treatment should be discontinued at the first evidence of skin erythema.

- **Darkening of the tongue and/or black stool**: Bismuth subsalicylate may cause a temporary and harmless darkening of the tongue and/or black stool, generally reversible within several days after treatment is stopped (see adverse reactions). Stool darkening should not be confused with melena.

- **Use in patients with blood dyscrasias**: Metronidazole is a nitroimidazole and should be used with caution in patients with evidence of, or history of, blood dyscrasia. A mild leukopenia has been observed during its administration.

### Atypical pathogens and respiratory tract infections [^112KT3ri]. The European Respiratory Journal (2004). Low credibility.

The atypical respiratory pathogens Chlamydia pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Legionella pneumophila are now recognized as significant causes of acute respiratory tract infections, implicated in community-acquired pneumonia, acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, asthma, and less frequently, upper respiratory tract infections. Chronic infection with C. pneumoniae is common among patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and may also play a role in the natural history of asthma, including exacerbations. The lack of a gold standard for diagnosing these pathogens still hinders the understanding of their true prevalence and role in the pathogenesis of acute and chronic respiratory infections.

While molecular diagnostic techniques, such as polymerase chain reaction, offer improvements in sensitivity, specificity, and rapidity over culture and serology, the need remains for a consistent and reproducible diagnostic technique, available to all microbiology laboratories. Treatment guidelines for community-acquired pneumonia recognize the importance of atypical respiratory pathogens in its etiology, for which macrolides are considered suitable first-line agents. The value of atypical coverage in antibiotic therapy for acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis and asthma exacerbations is less clear, while there is no evidence to suggest that atypical pathogens should be covered in antibiotic treatment of upper respiratory tract infections.

### Azithromycin [^113xXLZv]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Clinical studies**: In a controlled trial of community-acquired pneumonia conducted in the US, azithromycin (500 mg as a single daily dose by the intravenous route for 2 to 5 days, followed by 500 mg/day by the oral route to complete 7 to 10 days of therapy) was compared to cefuroxime (2,250 mg/day in three divided doses by the intravenous route for 2 to 5 days, followed by 1,000 mg/day in two divided doses by the oral route to complete 7 to 10 days of therapy), with or without erythromycin. For the 291 patients who were evaluable for clinical efficacy, the clinical outcome rates — i.e. cure, improved, and success (cure + improved) — among the 277 patients assessed at 10 to 14 days post-therapy were documented.

	- In a separate, uncontrolled clinical and microbiological trial performed in the US, 94 patients with community-acquired pneumonia who received azithromycin following the same regimen were evaluable for clinical efficacy. The clinical outcome rates — cure, improved, and success (cure + improved) — among the 84 patients assessed at 10 to 14 days post-therapy were documented.

	- Microbiological determinations in both trials were made at the pre-treatment visit and, where applicable, were reassessed at subsequent visits. Serological testing was conducted on both baseline and final visit specimens. The combined presumptive bacteriological eradication rates obtained from the evaluable groups were reported.

- **Combined bacteriological eradication rates for azithromycin**: The presumed bacteriological outcomes at 10 to 14 days post-therapy for patients treated with azithromycin were assessed and documented appropriately.

### Ofloxacin [^111sNMEN]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

- **Other microorganisms**: Chlamydia pneumoniae, Gardnerella vaginalis, Legionella pneumophila, Mycoplasma hominis, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Ureaplasma urealyticum. Ofloxacin is not active against Treponema pallidum (see WARNINGS). Many strains of other streptococcal species, Enterococcus species, and anaerobes are resistant to ofloxacin.

- **Dilution techniques**: Quantitative methods are used to determine antimicrobial minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC values). These MIC values provide estimates of the susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobial compounds. The MIC values should be determined using a standardized procedure. Standardized procedures are based on a dilution method (broth or agar) or equivalent with standardized inoculum concentrations and standardized concentrations of ofloxacin powder. The MIC values should be interpreted according to the following criteria:

	- For testing Enterobacteriaceae, methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa:

	- **For testing Haemophilus influenzae**: The absence of data on resistant strains precludes defining any results other than "Susceptible". Strains yielding MIC results suggestive of a "nonsusceptible" category should be submitted to a reference laboratory for further testing.

	- **For testing Neisseria gonorrhoeae**:

	- **For testing Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes**: A report of "Susceptible" indicates that the pathogen is likely to be inhibited if the antimicrobial compound in the blood reaches the concentration usually achievable. A report of "Intermediate" indicates that th

### Diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia. An official clinical practice guideline of the American Thoracic Society and Infectious Diseases Society of America [^114NQhP1]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for community-acquired pneumonia, particularly in the context of empiric antibiotic therapy and the outpatient setting, patients with comorbidities should adhere to the ATS/IDSA 2019 guidelines. These guidelines recommend administering combination therapy of a β-lactam (such as amoxicillin/clavulanate, cefpodoxime, or cefuroxime) and a macrolide (either azithromycin 500 mg PO on the first day followed by 250 mg PO daily, clarithromycin 500 mg PO BID, or clarithromycin extended-release 1,000 mg PO once daily). Alternatively, monotherapy with a respiratory fluoroquinolone is suggested, including levofloxacin 750 mg PO daily, moxifloxacin 400 mg PO daily, or gemifloxacin 320 mg PO daily. This is recommended for outpatients diagnosed with CAP who have comorbid conditions such as chronic heart, lung, liver, or renal disease, diabetes mellitus, alcohol use disorder, malignancy, or asplenia.

### Clinical outcomes for hospitalized patients with Legionella pneumonia in the antigenuria era: the influence of levofloxacin therapy [^1168jy1B]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2005). High credibility.

Although the reduction in case-fatality rate recently observed among patients with Legionella pneumonia has been largely attributed to the progressive utilization of urine antigen testing, other factors, such as changes in empirical antibiotic therapy, may also have contributed. We have analyzed more-recent outcomes of Legionella pneumonia in an institution where urine antigen testing was reflexly performed in cases of community-acquired pneumonia without an etiological diagnosis.

- **Methods**: From a prospective series of 1934 consecutive cases of community-acquired pneumonia in non-immunocompromised adults, 139 cases of Legionella pneumophila pneumonia were selected for observational review. Legionella cases were analyzed for outcome with respect to antibiotic treatment, mortality, complications, length of stay, time to defervescence, and stability.

- **Results**: The early case-fatality rate was 2.9% (4 of 139 patients), and the overall case-fatality rate was 5% (7 of 139 patients). One hundred twenty patients (86.3%) received an appropriate initial therapy, which included macrolides (i.e. erythromycin or clarithromycin) in 80 patients and levofloxacin in 40. Levofloxacin progressively replaced macrolides as the initial therapy during the study period. Compared with patients who received macrolides, patients who received levofloxacin had a faster time to defervescence (2.0 vs. 4.5 days; p < 0.001) and to clinical stability (3 vs. 5 days; p = 0.002). No differences were found regarding the development of complications (25% vs. 25%; p = 0.906) and case-fatality rate (2.5% vs. 5%).

### Legionella and community-acquired pneumonia: A review of current diagnostic tests from a clinician's viewpoint [^111ZbQpG]. The American Journal of Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Many physicians are unaware of the limitations of the available tests for diagnosing infections with Legionella organisms. Geographic differences in the importance of nonpneumophila Legionella species as pathogens are underrecognized, in part because available diagnostic tests are biased toward the detection of pneumophila serogroup 1. Routine laboratory practices reduce the likelihood of culturing Legionella species from clinical isolates. Failure of seroconversion is common, particularly with nonpneumophila species; even when seroconversion occurs, it may take much longer than four weeks. Urinary antigen testing has insufficient sensitivity to affect clinical management in most regions of the United States, as it can reliably detect only L. pneumophila serogroup 1 infections. Polymerase chain reaction-based techniques offer hope of providing highly sensitive, rapid diagnostic tests for all Legionella species, but limitations in the tests will make validating them difficult.

### Community-acquired Legionella pneumonia: New insights from the German competence network for community acquired pneumonia [^1136u15j]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

The Competence Network for Community Acquired Pneumonia (CAPNETZ) offers a unique opportunity to study the epidemiology of legionellosis throughout Germany, applying sophisticated diagnostic tools.

- **Methods**: The incidence, clinical characteristics, and outcome of Legionella pneumonia in 2,503 adult patients with community-acquired pneumonia, participating in the German Multicenter Study of the CAPNETZ, were studied.

- **Results**: Legionella pneumonia was diagnosed in 94 patients (3.8%), thus identifying Legionella species as one of the most common pathogens to cause community-acquired pneumonia. It was equally common among ambulatory and hospitalized patients (3.7% and 3.8%, respectively). The predominant species causing community-acquired pneumonia was Legionella pneumophila; however, 10% of cases were caused by other species not detectable by the urinary antigen test. Patients whose disease was diagnosed by urinary antigen testing experienced a more severe clinical course. Compared with hospitalized patients, ambulatory patients with Legionella pneumonia showed an equal sex distribution, were younger, had fewer comorbidities, fewer cases of discordant initial antimicrobial treatment, and a milder clinical course without fatalities. Thirty percent of patients with Legionella pneumonia received discordant initial antimicrobial treatment without increased mortality.

- **Conclusions**: Legionella is a leading cause of community-acquired pneumonia in Germany. It needs to be considered equally in hospitalized and ambulatory patients. A positive result of a urine antigen test.

### Role of environmental surveillance in determining the risk of hospital-acquired legionellosis: a national surveillance study with clinical correlations [^117DbCcc]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2007). Low credibility.

The hospital-acquired Legionella pneumonia has a fatality rate of 28%, and the source is the water distribution system. Two prevention strategies have been advocated: one approach to prevention is clinical surveillance for disease without routine environmental monitoring, and another approach recommends environmental monitoring even in the absence of known cases of Legionella pneumonia. We determined the Legionella colonization status of water systems in hospitals to establish whether the results of environmental surveillance correlated with the discovery of disease. None of these hospitals had previously experienced endemic hospital-acquired Legionella pneumonia.

- **Design**: Cohort study.

- **Setting**: Twenty US hospitals in 13 states.

- **Interventions**: Hospitals performed clinical and environmental surveillance for Legionella from 2000 through 2002. All specimens were shipped to the Special Pathogens Laboratory at the Veterans Affairs Pittsburgh Medical Center.

- **Results**: Legionella pneumophila and Legionella anisa were isolated from 14 (70%) of 20 hospital water systems. Of 676 environmental samples, 198 (29%) were positive for Legionella species. High-level colonization of the water system (30% or more of the distal outlets were positive for L. pneumophila) was demonstrated for 6 (43%) of the 14 hospitals with positive findings. L. pneumophila serogroup 1 was detected in 5 of these 6 hospitals, whereas 1 hospital was colonized with L. pneumophila serogroup 5. A total of 633 patients were evaluated for Legionella pneumonia from 12 (60%) of the 20 hospitals: 377 by urinary antigen testing.

### Legionnaires' disease [^113WuBa9]. Lancet (2016). Low credibility.

Since first identified in early 1977, bacteria of the genus Legionella are recognized as a common cause of community-acquired pneumonia and a rare cause of hospital-acquired pneumonia. Legionella bacteria exhibit multisystem manifestations that mainly affect susceptible patients due to age, underlying debilitating conditions, or immunosuppression.

Water serves as the major natural reservoir for Legionella. The pathogen is found in numerous natural and artificial aquatic environments, such as cooling towers or water systems in buildings, including hospitals. The term given to the severe pneumonia and systemic infection caused by Legionella bacteria is Legionnaires' disease. Over time, the prevalence of legionellosis or Legionnaires' disease has risen, possibly indicating a greater awareness and reporting of the disease.

Advances in microbiology have led to a better understanding of the ecological niches and pathogenesis of the condition. Legionnaires' disease is not always suspected due to its non-specific symptoms, and the diagnostic tests routinely available do not offer the desired sensitivity. However, effective antibiotics are available. Disease notification systems provide the basis for initiating investigations and limiting the scale and recurrence of outbreaks. This report reviews our understanding of this disease.

### Cavitary pulmonary nodules in an immunocompromised patient with urothelial carcinoma of the bladder [^114YfSkz]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Cavitation is not common with Legionella pneumonia, but it has been reported, especially in immunocompromised patients receiving glucocorticoid therapy. With respect to treatment, Legionella species are facultative intracellular bacteria and require agents with high intracellular activity, such as azithromycin or levofloxacin. In conclusion, physicians should maintain a high suspicion for L. micdadei infection in immunocompromised patients with pneumonia to ensure that appropriate diagnostic testing is performed, and they should consider this organism in the differential diagnosis of infection by acid-fast staining organisms.

In China, Legionnaires' disease is usually ignored in the differential diagnosis of pneumonia because most clinicians lack experience with this disease. This case highlights the need to familiarize physicians with diagnostic methods for identifying Legionella pneumonia in clinics in China and for further epidemiologic surveillance to monitor this disease and improve public health disease control strategies.

### Emblaveo [^117BbxPg]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Emblaveo is a combination of aztreonam, a monobactam antibacterial, and avibactam, a beta-lactamase inhibitor. When used in combination with metronidazole, it is indicated for patients 18 years and older who have limited or no alternative options for the treatment of complicated intra-abdominal infections (cIAI). These infections include those caused by the following susceptible gram-negative microorganisms: *Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae complex, Citrobacter freundii complex*, and *Serratia marcescens*. Approval of this indication is based on limited clinical safety and efficacy data for Emblaveo [see Clinical Studies (14.1)].

- **Usage to reduce development of drug-resistant bacteria**: To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of Emblaveo and other antibacterial drugs, Emblaveo should be used only to treat infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by bacteria.

### Acquired Fanconi syndrome in patients with Legionella pneumonia [^112AnYGM]. BMC Nephrology (2013). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia is often observed in patients with Legionella pneumonia; however, other electrolyte abnormalities are uncommon, and the mechanism remains to be clarified.

- **Case presentation**: We experienced two male cases of acquired Fanconi syndrome associated with Legionella pneumonia. The laboratory findings at admission showed hypophosphatemia, hypokalemia, hypouricemia, and/or hyponatremia. In addition, they had a generalized dysfunction of the renal proximal tubules, presenting with decreased tubular reabsorption of phosphate (%TRP), increased fractional excretion of potassium (FEK) and uric acid (FEUA), low-molecular-weight proteinuria, panaminoaciduria, and glycosuria. Therefore, they were diagnosed with Fanconi syndrome. Treatment for Legionella pneumonia with antibiotics resulted in the improvement of all serum electrolyte abnormalities and normalization of the %TRP, FEK, FEUA, low-molecular-weight proteinuria, panaminoaciduria, and glycosuria, suggesting that Legionella pneumophila infection contributed to the pathophysiology of Fanconi syndrome.

- **Conclusion**: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report demonstrating Fanconi syndrome associated with Legionella pneumonia.

The difference-in-differences (DiD) evaluation of azithromycin use in the pre-COVID-19 period versus the first three weeks of admitting COVID-19 patients showed a significant weekly increase of 48.7 days of therapy (DOT) per 1,000 days (95% CI, 21.7–75.7) compared to a significant weekly increase of 47.9 DOT per 1,000 days (95% CI, 12.6–83.2) for ceftriaxone use for internal medicine teams.

- **Azithromycin use for internal medicine teams**: In the second post-COVID-19 period, there was a significant decrease in azithromycin weekly antimicrobial use of 58.2 DOT per 1,000 days (95% CI, -78.0 to -38.3).

- **Ceftriaxone use for internal medicine teams**: A non-statistically significant increase in ceftriaxone weekly antimicrobial use of 13.6 DOT per 1,000 days (95% CI, -12.4 to 39.6) was present, adjusted for week and team (Supplementary Fig. online).

- **Azithromycin and cefepime use for MICU teams**: Azithromycin use and cefepime use over the same period showed no statistically significant difference in DOT per 1,000 days for the first three weeks or the later eight weeks of the defined COVID-19 period compared to the pre-COVID-19 period when adjusted for week and team (Supplementary Fig. online).

### Legionella micdadei infection presenting as severe secretory diarrhea and a solitary pulmonary mass [^115fYmom]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Sixty percent of infections with non-pneumophila species of Legionella are caused by Legionella micdadei. Although diarrhea is a common symptom of legionellosis, including that due to L. micdadei infection, severe, life-threatening diarrhea is rare. We describe a patient with profound secretory diarrhea (secretion rate, up to 8 L/day) that was secondary to culture-proven L. micdadei pneumonia. In addition, a 3-cm pulmonary nodule was detected, which completely resolved after proper treatment for Legionella infection. Resolving pulmonary nodules have been previously reported in association with the treatment of L. micdadei infections.

### SHEA statement on antibiotic stewardship in hospitals during public health emergencies [^116dQnL5]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2022). Low credibility.

HCP reasonably may consider empiric antibiotic treatment in instances when a patient has new symptoms (e.g. new fever after initial defervescence) and/or changes in lung imaging, signs of production of purulent sputum, dense lobar consolidation on radiograph, or rapid progression to severe COVID-19 requiring intubation and pressor support. Because the bacterial pathogens responsible for CAP often colonize the upper airway and opportunistically infect the lung, it is speculated that these same bacteria should be considered in patients with respiratory virus–related pneumonia including COVID-19 within the first days of hospitalization, and guidelines for CAP treatment should be followed. Streptococcus pneumoniae is the pathogen most frequently associated with influenza, followed mainly by S. aureus and Hemophilus influenzae. Recent studies have identified S. pneumoniae and S. aureus as the main causative agents of community-acquired coinfection at the time of COVID-19 diagnosis. Data on bacterial coinfections in patients who are immunosuppressed are sparse, but there may be scenarios, such as patients with febrile neutropenia, in which empiric antibiotic therapy at the time of COVID-19 or other respiratory viral diagnosis is justified.

It is important that HCP also consider the possibility of coinfection with viruses other than the pandemic strain. The use of non-pharmacologic interventions (e.g. mask use, social distancing) significantly disrupted the transmission of non–SARS-CoV-2 respiratory viruses during the first surge of the COVID-19 pandemic.

### Atypical pneumonias: Current clinical concepts focusing on Legionnaires' disease [^113XZFyt]. Current opinion in pulmonary medicine (2008). Low credibility.

This review provides clinicians with an overview of the clinical features of atypical pneumonias. Atypical community-acquired pneumonia pathogens cause systemic infections with pneumonia. The key to the clinical diagnosis of atypical pneumonias depends on recognizing the characteristic pattern of extrapulmonary organ involvement, which differs for each pathogen. As Legionella is likely to present as severe pneumonia and does not respond to beta-lactams, it is important to presumptively diagnose Legionnaires' disease clinically so that Legionella coverage is included in empiric therapy. This study reviews the clinical features and nonspecific laboratory markers of atypical pathogens, focusing on Legionnaires' disease.

- **Recent findings**: Case reports and outbreaks increase our understanding of Legionnaires' disease transmission. Both Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydophila pneumoniae may cause asthma. Antimicrobial therapy for Chlamydophila pneumoniae and Mycoplasma pneumoniae is important to decrease person-to-person spread and to prevent potential long-term sequelae.

- **Summary**: Atypical pulmonary pathogens cause systemic infections accompanied by a variety of characteristic extrapulmonary features. Clinically, it is possible to differentiate Legionnaires' disease from other typical and atypical pneumonias. Rapid clinical diagnosis of atypical pathogens, particularly Legionnaires' disease, is important in selecting effective empiric therapy and prompting definitive laboratory testing.

### Acquired Fanconi syndrome in patients with Legionella pneumonia [^117DQDMi]. BMC Nephrology (2013). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia is often observed in patients with Legionella pneumonia; however, other electrolyte abnormalities are uncommon, and the mechanism remains to be clarified.

- **Case presentation**: We experienced two male cases of acquired Fanconi syndrome associated with Legionella pneumonia. The laboratory findings at admission showed hypophosphatemia, hypokalemia, hypouricemia, and/or hyponatremia. In addition, they had the generalized dysfunction of the renal proximal tubules, presenting decreased tubular reabsorption of phosphate (%TRP), increased fractional excretion of potassium (FEK) and uric acid (FEUA), low-molecular-weight proteinuria, panaminoaciduria, and glycosuria. Therefore, they were diagnosed with Fanconi syndrome. Treatment for Legionella pneumonia with antibiotics resulted in the improvement of all serum electrolyte abnormalities and normalization of the %TRP, FEK, FEUA, low-molecular-weight proteinuria, panaminoaciduria, and glycosuria, suggesting that Legionella pneumophila infection contributed to the pathophysiology of Fanconi syndrome.

- **Conclusion**: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report demonstrating Fanconi syndrome associated with Legionella pneumonia.

### Empiric antibiotic coverage of atypical pathogens for community-acquired pneumonia in hospitalized adults [^114dGdnT]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). High credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is caused by various pathogens, traditionally divided into 'typical' and 'atypical' Initial antibiotic treatment of CAP is usually empirical, customarily covering both typical and atypical pathogens. At the time of writing, no sufficient evidence exists to support this broad coverage, while limiting coverage is bound to reduce toxicity, resistance, and expense.

- **Objective**: The main objective was to estimate the mortality and proportion with treatment failure using regimens containing atypical antibiotic coverage compared to those that had typical coverage only. Secondary objectives included the assessment of adverse events.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) Issue 3, 2012, which includes the Acute Respiratory Infection Group's Specialized Register, MEDLINE (January 1966 to April week 1, 2012), and EMBASE (January 1980 to April 2012).

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of adult patients hospitalized due to CAP, comparing antibiotic regimens with atypical coverage (quinolones, macrolides, tetracyclines, chloramphenicol, streptogramins, or ketolides) to a regimen without atypical antibiotic coverage.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently assessed the risk of bias and extracted data from included trials. We estimated risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We assessed heterogeneity using a Chi(2) test.

- **Main results**: We included 28 trials, encompassing 5939 randomized patients. The atypical antibiotic was administered as monotherapy.

### Acquired Fanconi syndrome in patients with Legionella pneumonia [^114dJDC4]. BMC Nephrology (2013). Low credibility.

Because the electrolyte abnormalities disappeared after treatment for Legionella pneumonia and there was no evidence of other causes of Fanconi syndrome, it is most likely that Fanconi syndrome was associated with Legionella pneumonia in our cases. This is the first report of acquired Fanconi syndrome caused by infectious diseases.

Hyponatremia is a relatively common electrolyte abnormality in patients with Legionella pneumonia. The responsible mechanism of hyponatremia is thought to be the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH). In accordance with this mechanism, the hyponatremia in Patient 1 was accompanied by improperly high levels of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) and improved following the recovery from Legionella pneumonia.

However, other electrolyte abnormalities are uncommon in patients with Legionella pneumonia, and the precise mechanism remains to be clarified. In our cases, the laboratory findings at admission also showed hypophosphatemia, hypokalemia, and hypouricemia. In addition, remarkably increased urinary excretion of low-molecular-weight proteins such as β2-microglobulin (β2-MG), decreased tubular reabsorption of phosphate (%TRP), increased fractional excretion of potassium (FEK) and uric acid (FEUA), panaminoaciduria, and glycosuria were coexistent. Therefore, our cases suggest that proximal tubular dysfunction caused these serum electrolyte abnormalities.

A relationship has recently been proposed between mitochondrial disorders and Fanconi syndrome. For instance, it is known that patients with mitochondrial disorders, including mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS), Kearns-Sayre syndrome, and anti-mitochondrial M2 antibody-positive primary biliary…

### Empiric antibiotic coverage of atypical pathogens for community acquired pneumonia in hospitalized adults [^115HC8Uh]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is caused by various pathogens, traditionally divided into 'typical' and 'atypical' categories. Initial antibiotic treatment of CAP is usually empirical, customarily covering both types of pathogens. At the time of writing, no sufficient evidence exists to support this broad coverage; meanwhile, limiting coverage could reduce toxicity, resistance, and expense.

- **Objectives**: To assess the efficacy and need of adding antibiotic coverage for atypical pathogens in hospitalized patients with CAP, in terms of mortality and successful treatment.

- **Search strategy**: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2007, Issue 1), including the Acute Respiratory Infection Group's specialized register; MEDLINE (January 1966 to March 2007); and EMBASE (January 1980 to January 2007).

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized trials of adult patients hospitalized due to CAP, comparing antibiotic regimens with atypical antibiotic coverage to a regimen without atypical antibiotic coverage.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently appraised the quality of each trial and extracted the data from included trials. Relative risks (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated, assuming an intention-to-treat (ITT) basis for the outcome measures.

- **Main results**: Twenty-five trials were included, encompassing 5,244 randomized patients. There was no difference in mortality between the atypical arm and the non-atypical arm (RR 1.15; 95% CI 0.85 to 1.56). The atypical arm showed an insignificant trend toward reduced treatment failure.

### Legionella pneumonia due to non-Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1: Usefulness of the six-point scoring system [^113ZNg98]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

For laboratory findings, hepatic dysfunction, hyponatraemia, and CPK elevation were indicated as more significant findings in Legionella pneumonia patients than in those with pneumonia from other aetiologies. Almost half of our patients (5/11, 45.5%) had normal liver enzymes; no patient had serum sodium < 130 mEq/L, and only 2 of 4 had CPK elevation. The number of patients who did not have liver enzyme elevation and hyponatraemia was 5 of 11 patients (45.5%). From these patterns of clinical symptoms and laboratory findings, Legionella pneumonia seemed difficult to predict in these patients.

The usefulness of the six-point scoring system proposed by Fiumefreddo et al. in predicting Legionella pneumonia was validated by Haubitz et al. They showed that a score of ≥ 5 had very high specificity of 99.0% (95% CI, 98.4–99.4) and a high positive predictive value of 17.4% (95% CI, 5.0–38.8), whereas a score of < 2 had high sensitivity of 94.4% (95% CI, 81.3–99.3) and a high negative predictive value of 99.6% (95% CI, 98.6–100). In this study, at a cut-off value of ≥ 2 points, the sensitivity of this scoring system was 54.5% (6/11) for non-L. pneumophila serogroup 1 patients and 95.7% (22/23) for L. pneumophila serogroup 1 patients. This finding indicated that we can rule out Legionella pneumonia due to L. pneumophila serogroup 1 by using this scoring system, whereas about half of the patients with Legionella pneumonia due to non-L. pneumophila serogroup 1 could have been misdiagnosed by this scoring system. Namely, Legionella pneumonia due to non-L. pneumophila serogroup 1 cannot be ruled out.

### Addition of macrolide antibiotics for hospital treatment of community-acquired pneumonia [^113i3MJ9]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2025). Low credibility.

Guidelines recommend the use of macrolides in patients with moderate to severe community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) to provide coverage of atypical pathogens and for their immunomodulatory effects. However, at a population level, we found no evidence that empirical macrolide combination therapy provided any benefit over β-lactam monotherapy, and atypical pathogens were rarely identified. Furthermore, in subgroup analyses by severity, we found no evidence of, or even a trend toward, greater potential benefits in the more severe subgroups.

Conversely, previous evidence has shown that macrolide use is associated with increased antibiotic resistance and a higher risk of adverse outcomes. For example, previous macrolide use has been associated with macrolide resistance among S. pneumoniae within individuals and in population-based studies; in children, mass dose azithromycin administration was associated with resistance in S. pneumoniae, S. aureus, and Escherichia coli. Several large cohort studies reported that azithromycin and clarithromycin were associated with a higher risk of adverse cardiovascular events, on which basis the US Food and Drug Administration subsequently published warnings on the use of azithromycin. A meta-analysis on 183 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) reported an increased rate of gastrointestinal adverse events with macrolide use. Moreover, macrolide use can affect microbiome composition in healthy adults.

Given the known risks associated with macrolides, routine empirical use of macrolides should be carefully balanced. Nevertheless, developing better diagnostic tools to accurately identify causative pathogens would significantly aid in treatment decisions.

### The association of antibiotic treatment regimen and hospital mortality in patients hospitalized with Legionella pneumonia [^115targL]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Guidelines recommend azithromycin or a quinolone antibiotic for the treatment of Legionella pneumonia. No clinical study has compared these strategies.

- **Methods**: We performed a retrospective cohort analysis of adults hospitalized in the United States with a diagnosis of Legionella pneumonia in the Premier Perspectives database (1 July 2008–30 June 2013). Our primary outcome was hospital mortality; we additionally evaluated hospital length of stay, development of Clostridium difficile colitis, and total hospital cost. We used propensity-based matching to compare patients treated with azithromycin versus a quinolone. All analyses were repeated on a subgroup of more severely ill patients, defined as requiring intensive care unit admission, mechanical ventilation, or having a predicted probability of hospital mortality in the top quartile for all patients.

- **Results**: Legionella pneumonia was diagnosed in 3,152 adults across 437 hospitals. Quinolones alone were used in 28.8%, azithromycin alone was used in 34.0%, and 1.8% received both. Crude hospital mortality was similar: 6.6% (95% confidence interval, 5.0%-8.2%) for quinolones versus 6.4% (95% CI, 5.0%-7.9%) for azithromycin (P = 0.87); after propensity matching (n = 813 in each group), mortality remained similar (6.3% [95% CI, 4.6%-7.9%] versus 6.5% [95% CI, 4.8%-8.2%], P = 0.84 for the whole cohort, and 14.9% [95% CI, 10.0%-19.8%] versus 18.3% [95% CI, 13.0%-23.6%], P = 0.36 for the more severely ill).

- **Conclusions**: There was no difference in hospital length of stay, development of C. difficile, or total hospital cost. Use of azithromycin or a quinolone antibiotic does not significantly impact hospital mortality in patients hospitalized with Legionella pneumonia.

- **Dosage and administration**: Refer to "Indications and Usage" and "Clinical Pharmacology" (12.3).

- **Community-acquired pneumonia**: The recommended dose of azithromycin for injection in the treatment of adult patients with community-acquired pneumonia, due to the indicated organisms, is 500 mg as a single daily dose by the intravenous route for at least two days. Intravenous therapy should be followed by azithromycin by the oral route at a single, daily dose of 500 mg, administered as two 250 mg tablets to complete a 7- to 10-day course of therapy. The timing of the switch to oral therapy should be determined at the discretion of the physician and in accordance with clinical response.

- **Pelvic inflammatory disease**: The recommended dose of azithromycin for injection for the treatment of adult patients with pelvic inflammatory disease, due to the indicated organisms, is 500 mg as a single daily dose by the intravenous route for one or two days. Intravenous therapy should be followed by azithromycin by the oral route at a single, daily dose of 250 mg to complete a 7-day course of therapy. The timing of the switch to oral therapy should be determined at the discretion of the physician and in accordance with clinical response.

### Does empiric therapy for atypical pathogens improve outcomes for patients with CAP [^116gfmsu]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

The present controversy regarding the need to cover atypical pathogens in the empiric therapy of community-acquired pneumonia is related to several issues, including the relevance of terminology, imprecise diagnostic methods, and perceived contradictory results of published evidence. Studies evaluating the time to clinical recovery and the use of earlier endpoints for evaluation suggest that appropriate therapy provides a benefit if an atypical pathogen is present. Since recent surveillance studies indicate that these pathogens are common, and until there are accurate, cost-effective, and easily interpreted laboratory tests to provide the etiologic diagnosis at the point of care, empiric therapy for atypical pathogens is supported.

### Weather-dependent risk for Legionnaires' disease, United States [^113HXGga]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Legionellosis is associated with a mild febrile illness, Pontiac fever, or Legionnaires' disease (LD), which is a cause of severe, atypical, community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Legionella spp. are aerobic, gram-negative bacilli common in the environment, identified as pathogenic after an outbreak of illness among attendees of a 1976 American Legion convention. Although there are several species of Legionella and different serotypes, L. pneumophilia causes most LD cases. The case-fatality rate for LD among community-dwelling persons is as high as 10%. Delayed initiation of appropriate antimicrobial drug therapy further increases death rates, and the severity of LD drives the rationale for covering atypical organisms in the guidelines for empiric treatment of CAP. In developed countries, Legionella causes 1%–4% of CAP cases. Thus, because the rate of LD is low, many persons with CAP may be unnecessarily treated for LD. In fact, a recent non-inferiority study, which included aggressive diagnostic testing, showed similar outcomes when treating and not treating for atypical organisms.

- **Seasonality and epidemiologic features**: A striking epidemiologic feature of Legionella-associated CAP is its seasonality; more cases are reported during the summer. In contrast, hospital-associated cases do not exhibit seasonality. Seasonality has been described in the mid-Atlantic United States, England as well as Wales, and the Netherlands. Changes in the use of cooling towers or additional testing for pneumonia during the summer have been hypothesized as causes of this seasonality. However, strong evidence indicates that weather particularly influences these patterns.

Regarding medical management for hospital-acquired pneumonia, more specifically with respect to empiric antibiotic therapy, the ATS/IDSA 2016 guidelines recommend considering the administration of an antibiotic with activity against MRSA in patients with HAP at high risk of mortality or with one of the following risk factors for MRSA infection:

- **Prior IV antibiotic use** within 90 days.
- **Hospitalization in a unit** where more than 20% of S. aureus isolates are methicillin-resistant.
- **Hospitalization in a unit** where the prevalence of MRSA is not known.

### Legionella pneumophila pathogenesis in the Galleria mellonella infection model [^112GuinS]. Infection and Immunity (2012). Low credibility.

Legionella pneumophila is a facultative intracellular human pathogen and the etiological agent of severe pneumonia known as Legionnaires' disease. Its virulence depends on protein secretion systems, in particular, the Dot/Icm type IV secretion system (T4SS), which is essential to establish a replication-permissive vacuole in macrophages. The analysis of the role of these systems and their substrates for pathogenesis requires easy-to-use models which approximate human infection. We examined the effectiveness of the larvae of the wax moth Galleria mellonella as a new model for L. pneumophila infection.

We found that the L. pneumophila strains 130b, Paris, and JR32 caused mortality of the G. mellonella larvae that was strain, infectious dose, growth phase, and T4SS dependent. Wild-type L. pneumophila persisted and replicated within the larvae, whereas T4SS mutants were rapidly cleared. L. pneumophila strain Lp02, which is attenuated in the absence of thymidine but has a functional T4SS, resisted clearance in G. mellonella up to 18 hours post-infection without inducing mortality.

Immunofluorescence and transmission electron microscopy revealed that L. pneumophila resided within insect hemocytes in a vacuole that ultrastructurally resembled the Legionella-containing vacuole (LCV) observed in macrophages. The vacuole was decorated with the T4SS effector and LCV marker SidC. Infection caused severe damage to the insect organs and triggered immune responses, including activation of the phenoloxidase cascade leading to melanization, nodule formation, and upregulation of antimicrobial peptides.
