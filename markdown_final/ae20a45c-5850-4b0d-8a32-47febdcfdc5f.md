## Question

When to discontinue menopause hormone therapy

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking when and how to discontinue menopausal hormone therapy. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the overarching principle of individualized, shared decision-making and annual reassessment. Then, I should verify the baseline benefit–risk profile by age and time since menopause. Next, I will examine evolving risks with duration, especially breast cancer, cardiovascular disease, and bone outcomes. After that, I need to check symptom persistence and whether the original indication remains. Then, I will review contraindications and risk enhancers that mandate discontinuation. Next, I should consider special populations such as premature/early menopause and women over 65. Finally, I will outline discontinuation strategies, monitoring, and post-discontinuation care, including bone and genitourinary considerations, and close with a concise decision framework summary.

> Let me first confirm the foundational principle: there is no fixed stopping age or duration rule; decisions should be individualized and revisited at least annually, using shared decision-making to balance benefits and risks as they evolve over time, and to align with the patient's goals and preferences [^114vNTEq] [^1169oVcS] [^114dwtC8].

> I need to check the baseline benefit–risk profile by age and time since menopause. The most favorable balance is generally in healthy women younger than 60 years or within 10 years of menopause; beyond these thresholds, absolute risks rise, though continuation may still be reasonable in select, well-counseled women with persistent symptoms or fracture risk, provided individualized risk mitigation is applied [^113CmpaW] [^113scWk6] [^1157hBxF].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about duration; I should verify how risks change over time. For combined estrogen–progestogen therapy, breast cancer risk becomes detectable after about 3–5 years and increases with longer use, whereas estrogen-alone therapy did not show increased breast cancer risk after a mean of 7 years in WHI; for estrogen-alone, some analyses suggest a protective signal, but I should be cautious and frame this as regimen-specific and context-dependent rather than a blanket protective effect [^114vNTEq] [^111sjpgh]. I should double-check the magnitude of absolute risk: a large individual-participant meta-analysis estimates that 5 years of use starting at age 50 adds about 2 per 100 women excess breast cancer with daily progestogen, about 1.4 per 100 with intermittent progestogen, and about 0.5 per 100 with estrogen-alone, with much of the excess accruing during and after use, which is crucial for counseling on duration [^114ykGim].

> Next, I should review cardiovascular and thrombotic risks. I need to ensure we avoid using MHT for primary or secondary cardiovascular prevention; WHI-era and subsequent analyses show increased risks of CHD, stroke, and VTE with initiation in older women or remote from menopause, whereas absolute risks are lower when started close to menopause; transdermal estrogen may mitigate VTE risk compared with oral, and baseline CVD risk assessment should inform route and dose selection [^115rXhAK] [^113nDTdC] [^111pvX15] [^1178U8Q1] [^112PurCg].

> I will now examine bone outcomes because they meaningfully influence discontinuation planning. Wait, let me verify the immediate post-discontinuation bone dynamics: after stopping systemic estrogen, bone mineral density typically declines by about 3–6% in the first year, with fracture risk returning to levels of nonusers within 1–2 years in WHI analyses; however, newer nested case–control data suggest a transient rebound increase in fracture risk after cessation that attenuates over time, with longer-term past use associated with modestly lower fracture risk than never-users, which complicates the older "no residual benefit" narrative and should be integrated into counseling and mitigation plans [^112JGdxM] [^113WtG2E] [^114ZrrVM] [^117MbwPX] [^111kcseH].

> Let me consider whether the original indication persists. Vasomotor symptoms commonly persist for a median of about 7.4 years and can continue beyond a decade; importantly, about half of women experience recurrence after discontinuation, so I should confirm symptom burden and trajectory before stopping and plan for management of rebound symptoms if they occur [^115SF8aJ] [^111FNApr]. For genitourinary syndrome of menopause, symptoms tend to worsen with prolonged estrogen deficiency; low-dose vaginal estrogen can be continued indefinitely without routine progestogen, and this should be distinguished from systemic therapy decisions during discontinuation discussions [^114vNTEq] [^114Fz332].

> I should confirm absolute contraindications and risk enhancers that necessitate discontinuation or preclude initiation. These include estrogen-dependent malignancy such as breast cancer, undiagnosed genital bleeding, prior venous thromboembolism or high thrombotic risk where transdermal estrogen may still be considered with caution, active liver disease, and high cardiovascular risk profiles; in such settings, nonhormonal therapies should be prioritized and systemic MHT generally avoided [^1112NDzW] [^1167Tqjo] [^1126xT89] [^116QZs7m].

> But wait, what if the patient is in a special population? For women with premature ovarian insufficiency or early menopause, I should verify that MHT is generally continued until the average age of natural menopause unless contraindicated, after which continuation can be reassessed; conversely, for women over 65, routine discontinuation is not mandated, and continuation may be reasonable for persistent VMS or fracture risk if benefits outweigh risks and mitigation strategies are in place, with periodic attempts to lower dose or stop when feasible [^112JyAtk] [^114dh9sV] [^1157hBxF].

> Next, I should review discontinuation strategy. I need to ensure shared decision-making about taper versus abrupt stop, even though high-quality comparative data are limited; many experts favor a gradual dose reduction over weeks to months to potentially blunt symptom rebound, but I should counsel that recurrence still occurs in about half of women regardless of tapering, and management of rebound may include nonhormonal options or, selectively, continuation of low-dose therapy if risks remain acceptable [^112qfBPr] [^111k5BjJ] [^111FNApr].

> I will now examine monitoring during and after discontinuation. Let me first confirm that unscheduled bleeding during therapy warrants evaluation for endometrial pathology, and that routine follow-up should reassess symptom control, blood pressure, weight/BMI, breast and cervical screening adherence, and evolving risk factors; after stopping, I should anticipate and proactively manage recurrent VMS, sleep disturbance, joint pain, and GSM, and consider bone protection strategies if fracture risk is high or if rapid bone loss is anticipated post-cessation [^115vZyd6] [^117P9JGo] [^112JGdxM].

> Hold on, I should verify bone-specific mitigation options when discontinuing in higher-risk women. Strategies include ensuring adequate calcium and vitamin D, implementing weight-bearing and resistance exercise, and considering pharmacologic therapy such as bisphosphonates or denosumab when indicated; I need to remember denosumab's rebound phenomenon upon discontinuation and plan accordingly, and I should also note that emerging data suggest a transient fracture risk increase after stopping MHT that may warrant anticipatory planning and follow-up bone density testing in selected patients [^117P9JGo] [^113MWyfY] [^114ZrrVM].

> Let me reconsider the final decision framework to ensure internal consistency. Discontinuation is most straightforward when the original indication resolves, contraindications emerge, or the patient prefers to stop; continuation is most defensible when bothersome VMS or GSM persist, fracture risk is high and alternatives are unsuitable, and the patient understands and accepts evolving risks with longer duration; in all cases, use the lowest effective dose, prefer transdermal routes when thrombotic or cardiovascular risk is a concern, and revisit the decision at least annually with transparent risk–benefit counseling and shared decision-making [^114vNTEq] [^1157hBxF] [^1169oVcS].

---

Discontinue menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) when **symptoms resolve** or when **risks outweigh benefits** [^111yvUiD], typically after 3–5 years [^notfound] for most women. Continue to **reassess annually**, using the lowest effective dose and individualizing decisions by age, comorbidities, and patient preference [^114TFAjK]. For women over 65, **do not routinely stop** [^114dh9sV]; taper if discontinuing, as about 50% will have symptom recurrence [^114vNTEq]. Use nonhormonal options for persistent symptoms or if contraindications arise [^1167Tqjo].

---

## General principles for discontinuation

- **Annual reassessment**: Revisit continuation at least yearly, aiming for the shortest effective duration [^1169oVcS] [^114UWJ1K].

- **Lowest effective dose**: Use the lowest effective dose and consider nonoral routes to mitigate risks [^1157hBxF].

- **Shared decision-making**: Tailor decisions to symptoms, risks, and patient preference [^112qfBPr] [^114dwtC8].

---

## Clinical scenarios warranting discontinuation

### Resolution of symptoms

Discontinue when **vasomotor symptoms resolve** and the patient has been symptom-free for 6–12 months [^notfound].

---

### Emergence of contraindications or adverse effects

Discontinue when any of the following occur:

- **Breast cancer**: Diagnosis or strong risk factors [^114zbvE8].

- **Cardiovascular disease**: New CVD, stroke, or VTE [^114UHQAt].

- **Liver disease**: New or worsening liver disease.

- **Unscheduled bleeding**: Persistent bleeding despite evaluation [^notfound].

---

### Duration of therapy

Discontinue after **3–5 years** for most women, balancing risks and benefits [^114YryjJ]. For **long-term use**, consider only with persistent symptoms or high fracture risk, using the lowest effective dose [^113CmpaW] [^1157hBxF].

---

## Age-specific considerations

### Women younger than 60 years or within 10 years of menopause

For women younger than 60 or within 10 years of menopause, the **benefit–risk ratio is favorable** [^115SF8aJ]; consider discontinuation when symptoms resolve or risks emerge [^114TFAjK]. Individualize decisions based on symptoms, risks, and patient preference [^115TEqN9].

---

### Women older than 60 years or more than 10 years postmenopause

For women older than 60 or more than 10 years postmenopause, **routine discontinuation is not required** [^114dh9sV]; reassess annually and taper if stopping [^114UWJ1K] [^114vNTEq]. Use caution due to higher risks of breast cancer, stroke, and VTE [^114ykGim] [^111yvUiD].

---

## Risks associated with prolonged MHT use

| **Risk category** | **Specific risks** | **Clinical implications** |
|-|-|-|
| Breast cancer | Increased risk with estrogen–progestin therapy [^114ykGim] | Limit duration, especially > 5 years [^114UWJ1K] |
| Cardiovascular disease | Increased risk of stroke, VTE, CHD [^111yvUiD] | Use caution in older women or those with CVD risk |
| Endometrial cancer | Risk with unopposed estrogen | Ensure adequate progestogen with intact uterus [^116nHVgh] |
| Ovarian cancer | Small increased risk with long-term use [^117NYBbf] | Consider in long-term users |

---

## Strategies for discontinuation

### Gradual tapering

Gradual tapering is **preferred** to reduce symptom recurrence; taper over weeks to months [^112qfBPr].

---

### Abrupt discontinuation

Abrupt discontinuation may be appropriate when **contraindications** arise or the patient prefers it, with close follow-up [^112qfBPr].

---

## Management of symptoms after discontinuation

Nonhormonal therapies — such as SSRIs/SNRIs, gabapentin, or clonidine — can be used for **persistent vasomotor symptoms** [^1167Tqjo] [^113woa1M]. For **genitourinary symptoms**, low-dose vaginal estrogen is safe and effective for GSM [^114vNTEq] [^114Fz332].

---

## Special considerations

- **Primary ovarian insufficiency**: Continue MHT until the average age of menopause, then reassess [^112JyAtk].

- **Osteoporosis**: MHT prevents bone loss; consider alternatives if discontinuing [^116L6LEC].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Annual reassessment**: Revisit continuation yearly [^1169oVcS].

- **Lowest effective dose**: Use the lowest effective dose and nonoral routes when possible [^1157hBxF].

- **Individualize decisions**: Base on symptoms, risks, and patient preference [^114dwtC8].

- **Taper when stopping**: Reduce symptom recurrence [^notfound].

- **Nonhormonal options**: Use for persistent symptoms or contraindications [^1167Tqjo].

---

Discontinue MHT when **symptoms resolve**, risks outweigh benefits, or contraindications arise, typically after 3–5 years. Reassess annually, use the lowest effective dose, and individualize decisions; taper if stopping, and use nonhormonal options for persistent symptoms.

### Is it time to revisit the recommendations for initiation of menopausal hormone therapy? [^113Vxb4F]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2025). High credibility.

Findings from the Women's Health Initiative studies led to menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) guidelines generally recommending the initiation of MHT be limited to women within 10 years of their menopause or before the age of 60 years. This recommendation has led to women who experience troublesome menopausal symptoms and who have not commenced MHT within these limits often being denied this type of therapy. Similarly, the majority of women who might benefit from the protective effects of MHT against bone loss and fracture are not offered this treatment option if they do not fit with these criteria. Based on review of the evidence that led to the conditional initiation of MHT, and subsequent studies, we propose that the recommendations regarding the initiation of MHT need to change to be more inclusive of women outside these chronological limits.

### The 2022 hormone therapy position statement of the North American Menopause Society [^114vNTEq]. Menopause (2022). High credibility.

Menopausal hormone therapy — discontinuation: Controversy exists regarding how long hormone therapy may safely be used and when it should be discontinued. Based on WHI findings, breast cancer risk becomes detectable after 3 to 5 years in women using estrogen-progestin therapy (EPT), whereas for women without a uterus using estrogen therapy (ET) alone, breast cancer risk did not increase after 7 years, so a longer duration of hormone therapy use may be acceptable. There are few studies to guide the optimal way to stop, and vasomotor symptoms (VMS) will recur in approximately 50% of women after discontinuation; data directly comparing abrupt versus tapered discontinuation are lacking, although clinical experts generally advise gradually decreasing hormone therapy doses over time. If hormone therapy is being used for prevention of osteoporosis, protection against bone density loss and fracture prevention is lost rapidly with discontinuation. Although VMS generally improve with time, genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM) worsens with prolonged estrogen deficiency, observational studies confirm the long-term safety of low-dose vaginal ET as a highly effective treatment for GSM, and, in the absence of contraindications, a woman should determine her preferred hormone therapy formulation, dose, and duration of use, with ongoing assessment and shared decision-making with her healthcare professional.

### The 2017 hormone therapy position statement of the North American Menopause Society [^111yvUiD]. Menopause (2018). Low credibility.

The 2017 Hormone Therapy Position Statement of The North American Menopause Society (NAMS) updates the 2012 Hormone Therapy Position Statement of The North American Menopause Society and identifies future research needs. An Advisory Panel of clinicians and researchers expert in the field of women's health and menopause was recruited by NAMS to review the 2012 Position Statement, evaluate new literature, assess the evidence, and reach consensus on recommendations, using the level of evidence to identify the strength of recommendations and the quality of the evidence. The Panel's recommendations were reviewed and approved by the NAMS Board of Trustees. Hormone therapy (HT) remains the most effective treatment for vasomotor symptoms (VMS) and the genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM) and has been shown to prevent bone loss and fracture. The risks of HT differ depending on type, dose, duration of use, route of administration, timing of initiation, and whether a progestogen is used. Treatment should be individualized to identify the most appropriate HT type, dose, formulation, route of administration, and duration of use, using the best available evidence to maximize benefits and minimize risks, with periodic reevaluation of the benefits and risks of continuing or discontinuing HT. For women aged younger than 60 years or who are within 10 years of menopause onset and have no contraindications, the benefit-risk ratio is most favorable for treatment of bothersome VMS and for those at elevated risk for bone loss or fracture. For women who initiate HT more than 10 or 20 years from menopause onset or are aged 60 years or older, the benefit-risk ratio appears less favorable because of the greater absolute risks of coronary heart disease, stroke, venous thromboembolism, and dementia. Longer durations of therapy should be for documented indications such as persistent VMS or bone loss, with shared decision making and periodic reevaluation. For bothersome GSM symptoms not relieved with over-the-counter therapies and without indications for use of systemic HT, low-dose vaginal estrogen therapy or other therapies are recommended.

### ACOG committee opinion no. 565: hormone therapy and heart disease [^116HaBj5]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2013). Low credibility.

Menopausal hormone therapy should not be used for the primary or secondary prevention of coronary heart disease at the present time. Evidence is insufficient to conclude that long-term estrogen therapy or hormone therapy use improves cardiovascular outcomes. Nevertheless, recent evidence suggests that women in early menopause who are in good cardiovascular health are at low risk of adverse cardiovascular outcomes and should be considered candidates for the use of estrogen therapy or conjugated equine estrogen plus a progestin for relief of menopausal symptoms. There is some evidence that lends support to the "timing hypothesis", which posits that cardiovascular benefit may be derived when estrogen therapy or hormone therapy is used close to the onset of menopause, but the relationship of duration of therapy to cardiovascular outcomes awaits further study. Clinicians should encourage heart-healthy lifestyles and other strategies to reduce cardiovascular risk in menopausal women. Because some women aged 65 years and older may continue to need systemic hormone therapy for the management of vasomotor symptoms, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends against routine discontinuation of systemic estrogen at age 65 years. As with younger women, use of hormone therapy and estrogen therapy should be individualized based on each woman's risk-benefit ratio and clinical presentation.

### Treatment of symptoms of the menopause: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^114TFAjK]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2015). Medium credibility.

Menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) monitoring and discontinuation — For women with persistent unscheduled bleeding while taking MHT, we recommend evaluation to rule out pelvic pathology, most importantly, endometrial hyperplasia and cancer, and we recommend informing women about the possible increased risk of breast cancer during and after discontinuing EPT and emphasizing the importance of adhering to age-appropriate breast cancer screening. We suggest that the decision to continue MHT be revisited at least annually, targeting the shortest total duration of MHT consistent with the treatment goals and evolving risk assessment of the individual woman. For young women with primary ovarian insufficiency (POI), premature or early menopause, without contraindications, we suggest taking MHT until the time of anticipated natural menopause, when the advisability of continuing MHT can be reassessed. For women preparing to discontinue MHT, we suggest a shared decision-making approach to elicit individual preference about adopting a gradual taper vs abrupt discontinuation.

### The 2022 hormone therapy position statement of the North American Menopause Society [^113CmpaW]. Menopause (2022). High credibility.

Menopausal hormone therapy — key points: The safety profile of hormone therapy is most favorable when initiated in healthy women aged younger than 60 years or within 10 years of menopause onset, so initiation of hormone therapy by menopausal women aged older than 60 years requires careful consideration of individual benefits and risks. [Level I] Long-term use of hormone therapy, including for women aged older than 60 years, may be considered in healthy women at low risk of CVD and breast cancer with persistent VMS or at elevated risk of fracture for whom other therapies are not appropriate. (Level III) Factors that should be considered include severity of symptoms, effectiveness of alternative nonhormone interventions, and underlying risk for osteoporosis, CHD, cerebrovascular accident, VTE, and breast cancer. (Level III) Hormone therapy does not need to be routinely discontinued in women aged older than 60 or 65 years. (Level III)

### The 2022 hormone therapy position statement of the North American Menopause Society [^116L6LEC]. Menopause (2022). High credibility.

Osteoporosis key points — Hormone therapy prevents bone loss in healthy postmenopausal women, with dose-dependent effects on bone density (Level I), and hormone therapy reduces fracture risk in healthy postmenopausal women (Level I). Hormone therapy is FDA approved for prevention of bone loss, but not for treatment of osteoporosis (Level I). In the absence of contraindications, in women aged younger than 60 years or within 10 years of menopause onset, systemic hormone therapy is an appropriate therapy to protect against bone loss (Level I). Unless contraindicated, women with premature menopause without prior fragility fracture or osteoporosis are best served with hormone therapy or oral contraceptives to prevent bone density loss and reduce fracture risk, rather than other bone-specific treatments, until the average age of menopause, when treatment may be reassessed (Level II). Decisions regarding initiating and discontinuation of hormone therapy should be made primarily on the basis of extraskeletal benefits (ie, reduction of VMS) and risks (Level III).

### The 2022 hormone therapy position statement of the North American Menopause Society [^1157hBxF]. Menopause (2022). High credibility.

NAMS position statement — risk mitigation, monitoring, and continuation of hormone therapy in older women emphasizes that mitigation of risk through use of the lowest effective dose and potentially with a nonoral route of administration becomes increasingly important as women age and with longer duration of therapy, and that longer durations or extended use beyond age 65 should include periodic reevaluation of comorbidities with consideration of periodic trials of lowering or discontinuing hormone therapy. In the absence of contraindications, a woman should determine her preferred hormone therapy formulation, dose, and duration of use, with ongoing assessment and shared decision-making with her healthcare professional, and it remains an individual decision in select, well-counseled women aged older than 60 or 65 years to continue therapy, with no data to support routine discontinuation in women aged 65 years. For women with GSM, low-dose vaginal ET may be considered for use at any age and for extended duration, if needed.

### Treatment of symptoms of the menopause: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^114UWJ1K]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2015). Medium credibility.

Duration of menopausal hormone therapy — We suggest that the decision to continue MHT be revisited at least annually, targeting the shortest total duration of MHT consistent with the treatment goals and evolving risk assessment of the individual woman. Technical remarks note that current proposed limits on duration are informed by large intervention trials (5 to 7 y) with extended follow-up for 13 years, that risk rates for breast cancer and CVD increase with age and time since menopause with risks appearing less with ET than with EPT, and that ovarian cancer risk may also increase relative to duration of MHT. The guideline concludes that clinicians and patients should reassess MHT continuation yearly and discuss the risks and individual benefits beyond 5 years.

### The 2022 hormone therapy position statement of the North American Menopause Society [^114dh9sV]. Menopause (2022). High credibility.

Menopausal hormone therapy — extended use after age 65 years: There is no general rule for stopping systemic hormone therapy in a woman aged 65 years, and although the Beers criteria warns against hormone therapy in women aged older than 65 years, the recommendation to routinely discontinue systemic hormone therapy in women aged 65 years and older is neither cited or supported by evidence nor is it recommended by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists or The North American Menopause Society. For otherwise healthy women with persistent vasomotor symptoms (VMS), continuing hormone therapy beyond age 65 years is a reasonable option with appropriate counseling, regular assessment of risks and benefits, and shared decision-making, and hormone therapy also may be considered for prevention of fracture in healthy older women at elevated fracture risk when bothersome VMS persist or when hormone therapy remains the best choice because of lack of efficacy or intolerance of other fracture-prevention therapies; however, long-duration hormone therapy use and use in older women is not appropriate for reduction in the risk of CHD or dementia, and mitigation strategies include switching from oral to transdermal hormone therapy, choice of progestogen, and lowering of dose.

### Discontinuation of postmenopausal hormone therapy [^114QXaeo]. The American Journal of Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Current guidelines recommend that postmenopausal hormone therapy (HT) be used primarily for treatment of vasomotor and urogenital symptoms associated with the menopausal transition and that women use the lowest effective dose for the shortest time necessary. Vasomotor symptoms improve or resolve spontaneously within a few months to a few years of onset in the majority of women, suggesting that most women should be able to discontinue HT within a few years of starting treatment. Approximately 75% of women who try to stop are able to stop HT without major difficulty. However, some women who would like to stop HT are unable to do so, mainly owing to the development of vasomotor symptoms. Troublesome symptoms associated with stopping HT appear to be more common among women who start HT for treatment of symptoms, but they also are reported by women who started HT for other reasons, such as prevention of osteoporosis. Unfortunately, little information is available to guide physicians in helping women who have difficulty stopping HT. Many clinicians recommend slowly tapering HT or adding another drug for treatment of hot flashes, but the effectiveness of these approaches has not been evaluated. For women who cannot tolerate even a slow taper, the value of symptom relief likely outweighs any increased risks due to HT use.

### A decade after the women's health initiative – the experts do agree [^112z5taw]. Fertility and Sterility (2012). Medium credibility.

Conclusion — indication for hormone therapy — states that leading medical societies devoted to the care of menopausal women agree that the decision to initiate hormone therapy should be for the indication of treatment of menopause-related symptoms, and although research is ongoing and these recommendations may be modified over time, there is no question that hormone therapy has an important role in managing symptoms for women during the menopausal transition and in early menopause.

### Management of symptomatic vulvovaginal atrophy: 2013 position statement of the North American Menopause Society [^111ZzYLd]. Menopause (2013). Medium credibility.

Regarding medical management for menopause, more specifically with respect to considerations for hormone therapy, NAMS 2013 guidelines recommend to recognize that:

- estrogen therapy carries a class effect risk of VTE

- low-dose vaginal estrogen may carry a very low risk but there has been no report of an increased risk in the vaginal estrogen clinical trials

- insufficient evidence in high-risk patients.

### The 2022 hormone therapy position statement of the North American Menopause Society [^115SF8aJ]. Menopause (2022). High credibility.

Duration of use, initiation after age 60 years, and discontinuation — benefits of hormone therapy generally outweigh risks for healthy women with bothersome symptoms who are aged younger than 60 years or within 10 years of menopause onset, but because increasing risk is observed with advancing age and extended duration of use, women are advised to use the appropriate dose for the time needed to manage symptoms. Because many women will experience bothersome vasomotor symptoms (VMS) for many years, long-duration hormone therapy may be needed and an arbitrary age-based stopping rule is not clinically appropriate; frequent VMS persist on average 7.4 years and for many more than 10 years. In a study of Swedish women aged older than 85 years, 16% reported hot flashes at least several times per week, and up to 8% of women continue to have hot flashes for 20 years or longer after menopause.

Menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) initiation timing — Current recommendations suggest that the initiation of MHT should generally be limited to women < 60 years of age or < 10 years after menopause onset; evidence in younger, symptomatic women is limited, with no adequately powered RCTs with clinical outcomes, and the best available evidence comes from subgroup analyses of WHI data in women 50 to 59 years of age or < 10 years since menopause onset.

### Assessing benefits and harms of hormone replacement therapy: clinical applications [^113U5vbf]. JAMA (2002). Excellent credibility.

An estimated one third of postmenopausal women in the United States use hormone replacement therapy (HRT) to treat symptoms of menopause and prevent chronic conditions. In the context of this widespread use, evidence has been growing about the potential harms of HRT, particularly regarding long-term use. Physicians and patients are often confused about how to use results of studies in individual cases. This article applies the current state of evidence for the benefits and harms of HRT to management decisions in 4 clinical situations. Patient preferences, as well as evidence, are important for these decisions. Benefits and harms need to be readdressed periodically to apply newly published evidence and to reassess emerging risks, comorbidities, and needs of individuals.

### Update in hormone therapy use in menopause [^116EhNVU]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). Low credibility.

The original report from the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) changed our understanding of the benefits and risks of hormone therapy. Since that time, reanalysis of the WHI and additional data from other studies have further refined these concepts. Here we provide an update on recent advances in the field. Menopausal hormone therapy continues to have a clinical role in the management of vasomotor symptoms. However, our understanding of the role of hormones in cardiovascular disease and breast cancer continues to evolve. Further analyses of the effect of age and proximity to menopause at the time of initiation of therapy, duration of treatment, dose, route of administration, and the persistence of risks and benefits after stopping hormone therapy are described. In addition, recent data have emerged suggesting that there may be a link between hormone therapy and cancers of the lung and ovary. Finally, we discuss new advances in hormone therapy that will likely lead to a more favorable benefit-to-risk ratio, enabling safer effective menopausal symptom relief.

Regular clinical follow-up, initially, within 1 to 3 months after starting MHT, and then every 6 to 12 months, allows monitoring of efficacy and side effects and treatment adjustments as needed.

### Discontinuation of menopausal hormone therapy and risk of fracture: nested case-control studies using routinely collected primary care data [^114ZrrVM]. The Lancet: Healthy Longevity (2025). High credibility.

One of the most notable findings of the study is the contrasting fracture risk paths which illustrates the difference between short-term and long-term menopausal hormone therapy use. Although short-term use might give a lower level of protection overall and, post-cessation, a weaker long-term attenuation of rising fracture risk, stopping menopausal hormone therapy at an earlier age means that the initial return to the norm is less severe and the subsequent excess risk period occurs over a lower-risk age period. There appears to be a trade-off between this smoother, less-attenuated risk path and the more changeable longer-term use path, which includes a more extreme risk rise immediately after discontinuation.

Our study suggests that, even after stopping menopausal hormone therapy, women could benefit from notably reduced fracture risk in older age. This likelihood holds for those who might have used menopausal hormone therapy for shorter periods because of concerns such as breast cancer. The study also suggests that women at higher fracture risk could possibly be helped to manage the transition from discontinuation through risk rebound, to the end of any period of excess risk. Such women could include those with known fracture risk factors before starting menopausal hormone therapyand those who have used the therapy (particularly combined oestrogen–progestogen formulations) for longer durations. Possible topics for clinical research could include tapered, rather than sudden, cessation of menopausal hormone therapy or other bone health treatments.

Menopausal hormone therapy is widely the treatment of choice for managing menopause symptoms, but existing guidance has been unable to indicate, after discontinuation, long-term fracture-risk outcomes or reliable estimates of relative fracture risk change by type or regimen of therapy. Our study delivers this information and, given longer life expectations and fracture risk increasing with age, should encourage further research both to improve the safety and utility of menopausal hormone therapy treatments and counter the potential personal and social burdens.

### Discontinuation of menopausal hormone therapy and risk of fracture: nested case-control studies using routinely collected primary care data [^117MbwPX]. The Lancet: Healthy Longevity (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Bone mineral density decreases with age and can decrease more rapidly in women during the period of menopause. Among ageing populations, rising levels of osteoporosis and fractures have become major health-care, societal, and economic concerns. Menopausal hormone therapy is a preferred treatment for menopause symptoms, and the beneficial effects on bone density and fracture risk while patients receive this therapy are well known. Some studies have investigated bone health or fracture outcomes after menopausal hormone therapy has ceased, but existing findings are inconsistent, with a lack of long-term evidence.

Research in context

A meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials of menopausal hormone therapy (dominated by the Women's Health Initiative, which followed-up women for up to 5 years after treatment) reported fracture risk decreases for current users but an unchanged risk post-discontinuation. The Million Women Study, a large observational study that investigated fracture risks during and after menopausal hormone therapy, similarly reported decreased fracture risks in current users but found no reportable change post-cessation. However, a US study of menopausal hormone therapy users reported a 55% rise in hip fracture risk after discontinuation, compared with current use. A National Osteoporosis Risk Assessment study found that bone density was higher in longer-term menopausal hormone therapy users and, although bone density decreased post-discontinuation, remained high compared with never-users. However, the number of fracture events was insufficient to demonstrate risk differences for different combinations of duration and recency of menopausal hormone therapy use. All studies had power limitations during follow-up. Other evidence on fracture risks after stopping menopausal hormone therapy is also inconsistent, underpowered, or based only on short-term menopausal hormone therapy use, despite about 40% of UK therapy users having a more than 5-year exposure.

We aimed to investigate the relationship between the risk of any fracture in users of menopausal hormone therapy and recency and duration of past use, focusing on the period after stopping menopausal hormone therapy and into the medium-term and long-term future.

### Rethinking menopausal hormone therapy: for whom, what, when, and how long? [^116rfD6e]. Circulation (2023). Medium credibility.

Menopausal hormone therapy (HT) was widely used in the past, but with the publication of seminal primary and secondary prevention trials that reported an excess cardiovascular risk with combined estrogen-progestin, HT use declined significantly. However, over the past 20 years, much has been learned about the relationship between the timing of HT use with respect to age and time since menopause, HT route of administration, and cardiovascular disease risk. Four leading medical societies recommend HT for the treatment of menopausal women with bothersome menopausal symptoms. In this context, this review, led by the American College of Cardiology Cardiolovascular Disease in Women Committee, along with leading gynecologists, women's health internists, and endocrinologists, aims to provide guidance on HT use, including the selection of patients and HT formulation with a focus on caring for symptomatic women with cardiovascular disease risk.

### Discontinuation of menopausal hormone therapy and risk of fracture: nested case-control studies using routinely collected primary care data [^117CvStP]. The Lancet: Healthy Longevity (2025). High credibility.

There was some uncertainty in our data regarding the cause of fracture, so the magnitudes of our estimates of fracture risk associated with menopausal hormone therapy are likely to be conservative. However, our analysis of fragility fractures, commonly connected to osteopenia, showed lower risks for current users and sharper risk increases after discontinuation of menopausal hormone therapy, further underlining the strength of our observations. Onset of menopause was not reliably recorded, but we included all available information on menopausal symptoms. However, some residual confounding always remains, despite design rigour.

The observed increases in risk to levels often higher than for never-users after discontinuation of menopausal hormone therapy reflect a similar rebound effect when denosumab (an anti-resorptive) is discontinued and increases in bone resorption raise concerns about fractures. However, the subsequent persistent attenuation of age-related rising fracture risk among users who discontinued menopausal hormone therapy compared with never-users, is novel and unexpected. We have investigated other possible factors, such as patient characteristics, to explain these results, but have found no conclusive associations. We therefore suspect that the results might reflect a previously unobserved outcome of menopausal hormone therapy use which, in the longer term post-discontinuation, slows progressive decline in bone strength.

### Indications for hormone therapy: the post-women's health initiative era [^115CsoFr]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

Information from the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) trial has given physicians valuable tools for counseling women aged 50 to 79 years about the short-term risks of hormone therapy (HT). Unanswered questions remain, particularly on the risks and benefits of discontinuing HT among long-term users. The decision to discontinue HT should be carefully considered, because stopping and re-starting after several months may "reset the clock" for risks associated with changes in hepatic protein synthesis. The current authors recommend low-dose transdermal hormonal formulations, but no large-scale randomized trials exist to confirm the veracity of this recommendation. It has been suggested that starting HT in the menopausal transition would alleviate the HT risks observed withWHI. Until additional data are available to counsel women in the menopausal transition, however, the conservative counseling approach is to apply those figures available from the WHI, particularly because women aged 50 to 59 years using estrogen-progestin therapy have an unfavorable risk-benefit ratio, similar to that seen in older women.

### Treatment of menopausal symptoms: what shall we do now? [^113woa1M]. Lancet (2005). Excellent credibility.

During the past few years, many women and doctors have revised their opinions of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) for menopausal symptoms, and a substantial number of individuals have discontinued its use because of concerns about side-effects. Numerous alternatives to HRT are promoted, and assessment of the quality of evidence about the safety and effectiveness of these compounds can be difficult. In this Review, we summarise the data from studies addressing the efficacy, risks, and benefits of frequently prescribed treatments, and offer evidence-based clinical guidelines for the management of menopausal symptoms. Although few comparative studies exist, oestrogen alone or combinations of oestrogen and progestagen are likely to be the most effective treatments for menopausal hot flushes and vaginal dryness. Tibolone is as effective as HRT, however, and might also improve libido. For those who wish to avoid hormonal treatments, there are few effective options. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors might be effective in the very short term (less than 12 weeks) and are well tolerated. There is not enough evidence that any of the complementary therapies available are any better than placebo for menopausal vasomotor symptoms, and few safety data exist.

Outcomes after discontinuing menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) — Menopausal symptoms and joint pain can recur when MHT is discontinued; accelerated bone loss was reported after stopping MHT, whereas bone density is stable for some years after discontinuing bisphosphonate therapy; most expert groups do not recommend initiating bisphosphonate therapy for osteoporosis prevention in women aged 50 to 59, and adverse effects such as osteonecrosis of the jaw and atypical femur fractures, while rare, increase with the duration of therapy; in the long-term follow-up of the WHI, hip fracture rates did not increase during 5 to 7 years of observation after MHT was discontinued; breast cancer risk after 5 years of EPT in the WHI persisted 7 years after discontinuation; a large meta-analysis found a persistent risk of ovarian cancer up to a decade after discontinuing MHT; urinary incontinence persisted after oral MHT was discontinued, but the percentage affected was approximately one-third less than during active treatment; MHT discontinuation may result in symptoms of VVA, and when oral therapy is discontinued, glucose, cholesterol, triglycerides, calcium, and TSH levels may change.

Vasomotor symptoms (VMS) — hormone therapy dosing, timelines, and discontinuation guidance — Compared with placebo, estrogen therapy (ET) alone or estrogen-progestogen therapy (EPT) reduced weekly symptom frequency by 75% (95% CI, 64.3–82.3). Lower-dose regimens — oral conjugated equine estrogens (CEE) 0.3 mg, oral 17β-estradiol ≤ 0.5 mg, or an estradiol patch 0.025 mg — may take 6 to 8 weeks to provide adequate symptom relief. The lowest dose-approved estradiol weekly patch (0.014 mg/d) appears effective for VMS but is FDA approved only for prevention of osteoporosis. Progestogen-only options reported effective for VMS include medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) 10 mg, oral megestrol acetate 20 mg, and micronized progesterone (MP) 300 mg. VMS return in approximately 50% of women after hormone therapy is discontinued, and there is no consistent evidence that gradual tapering is superior to abrupt stopping.

### Treating menopause-MHT and beyond [^111vgWPo]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2022). High credibility.

Every woman who lives past midlife will experience menopause, which, by definition, is complete cessation of ovarian function. This process might occur spontaneously (natural menopause) or be iatrogenic (secondary menopause), and can be further classified as 'early' if it occurs before the age of 45 years and 'premature' if it occurs before the age of 40 years. Globally, the mean age of natural menopause is 48.8 years, with remarkably little geographic variation. A woman's age at menopause influences health outcomes in later life. Early menopause is associated with a reduced risk of breast cancer, but increased risks of premature osteoporosis, cardiovascular disease and premature death. The cardinal symptoms of menopause, and adverse health sequelae, are due to loss of ovarian oestrogen production. Consequently, menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) that includes oestrogen or an oestrogenic compound ameliorates menopausal symptoms, while preventing menopause-associated bone loss and cardiometabolic changes. Importantly, comprehensive care of postmenopausal women involves lifestyle optimization (attention to nutrition and physical activity, reducing alcohol consumption and not smoking) and treating other established chronic disease risk factors. This Review offers a commentary specifically on the contemporary use of MHT and novel pharmaceutical alternatives to manage menopausal symptoms.

In the Women's Health Initiative (WHI), discontinuation of HT was associated with a return of fracture risk to levels seen in women who had received placebo, with no excess fracture risk observed.

Clinicians prescribe estrogen alone for women without a uterus, use "the lowest effective dose with upward titration based on clinical response", and "usually do not measure estradiol levels to monitor therapy except when symptoms do not improve with escalating doses, particularly after changing the mode of administration from oral to transdermal". For younger women with surgical menopause or those with POI, higher starting doses may be used, for example "transdermal estradiol, 100 μg", then tapered as tolerated, and "the reassessment and tapering of MHT dose seems reasonable" as premature menopause approaches the natural menopause age.

### The 2012 hormone therapy position statement of: the North American Menopause Society [^114YryjJ]. Menopause (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

This position statement aimed to update the evidence-based position statement published by The North American Menopause Society (NAMS) in 2010 regarding recommendations for hormone therapy (HT) for postmenopausal women. This updated position statement further distinguishes the emerging differences in the therapeutic benefit-risk ratio between estrogen therapy (ET) and combined estrogen-progestogen therapy (EPT) at various ages and time intervals since menopause onset.

Methods

An Advisory Panel of expert clinicians and researchers in the field of women's health was enlisted to review the 2010 NAMS position statement, evaluate new evidence, and reach consensus on recommendations. The Panel's recommendations were reviewed and approved by the NAMS Board of Trustees as an official NAMS position statement.

Results

Current evidence supports the use of HT for perimenopausal and postmenopausal women when the balance of potential benefits and risks is favorable for the individual woman. This position statement reviews the effects of ET and EPT on many aspects of women's health and recognizes the greater safety profile associated with ET.

Conclusions

Recent data support the initiation of HT around the time of menopause to treat menopause-related symptoms and to prevent osteoporosis in women at high risk of fracture. The more favorable benefit-risk ratio for ET allows more flexibility in extending the duration of use compared with EPT, where the earlier appearance of increased breast cancer risk precludes a recommendation for use beyond 3 to 5 years.

### Menopause hormone therapy: 30 years of advances and controversies [^114ix3BR]. Endocrine Practice (2025). Medium credibility.

Menopause Hormone Therapy (MHT) recommendations have changed significantly over the last thirty years. Early observational studies suggested that MHT offered broad benefits for women, including relief from menopausal symptoms, improved genitourinary health, prevention of osteoporosis, and reduction in cardiovascular disease. As randomized controlled trials were conducted to validate these findings, new evidence emerged that led to shifts in guidance from medical societies and sharp declines in MHT prescriptions. This review summarizes three decades of studies, key advancements and ongoing controversies. We also discuss recommendations for MHT from cardiology, obstetrics/ gynecology and endocrinology perspectives.

### Update on menopause hormone therapy; current indications and unanswered questions [^114pVtrs]. Clinical Endocrinology (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

To provide clinicians involved in managing menopause with a summary of current evidence surrounding menopause hormone therapy (MHT).

Design

The authors evaluate and synthesize existing pooled evidence relating to MHT's clinical indications, efficacy, and safety and explore the limitations of existing data.

Patients

The review focuses on MHT-related outcomes in women with natural-timed menopause captured within observational studies, RCTs, and pooled data from pivotal meta-analyses and reviews.

Measurements

Available published data are scrutinized. Available evidence and notably lacking data from women not adequately represented in published MHT trials, such as those with socioeconomic adversity, significant comorbidities, and minority ethnic backgrounds, are highlighted and deliberated.

Results

The impact of MHT differs significantly between demographics. Current consensus recommendations for MHT emphasize the importance of tailoring type, route, dose, and duration of therapy to individual needs and risk/benefit ratio through shared decision-making. MHT impact can change over time. Current MHT data support its benefits for treating menopause symptoms and a potential window of opportunity in midlife to benefit skeletal health. Limitations of current evidence highlight menopause health inequalities and underscores the need for further research.

Conclusions

This review recommends tailored use of MHT for well-defined indications, recognizing its value for menopause symptom relief and skeletal benefits for many midlife women. MHT may be used as long as benefits outweigh risks, through shared decision-making. There is insufficient clinical evidence to support the long-term use of MHT in some contemporary cohorts of women accessing MHT in clinical practice.

### What the women's health initiative has taught us about menopausal hormone therapy [^111pvX15]. Clinical Cardiology (2018). Low credibility.

Our understanding of the complex relationship between menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk has been informed by detailed analyses in the Women's Health Initiative (WHI), the largest randomized, placebo-controlled trial evaluating MHT in postmenopausal women. Although the WHI demonstrated increased risk of CVD events with MHT in the overall cohort, subsequent secondary analyses demonstrated that these risks were influenced by the woman's age and time since menopause, with lower absolute risks and hazard ratios for younger than older women. As MHT is the most effective treatment for the vasomotor symptoms of menopause, it is important to understand its risks and how to conduct risk stratification for symptomatic women. In addition to reviewing the WHI findings, studies pre- and post-WHI are reviewed to describe the relationship between MHT and CVD risk in menopausal women. The absolute risks of adverse cardiovascular events for MHT initiated in women close to menopause are low, and all-cause mortality effects are neutral or even favorable for younger menopausal women. The WHI has advanced and refined our understanding of the relationship between MHT and CVD risk. Although MHT should not be used for CVD prevention, absolute risks of CVD are low when MHT is started close to menopause in healthy women and hazard ratios tend to be lower for younger than older women. For women in early menopause and without contraindications to treatment, the benefits of MHT are likely to outweigh the risks when used for menopausal symptom management.

### Symptom experience after discontinuing use of estrogen plus progestin [^112nwozZ]. JAMA (2005). Excellent credibility.

Context

Little is known about women's experiences after stopping menopausal hormone therapy.

Objective

To describe women's symptoms and management strategies after stopping the intervention in a large estrogen plus progestin trial.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Cross-sectional survey of 8405 women (89.9%; N = 9351) at 40 clinical centers who were still taking study pills (conjugated equine estrogens plus medroxyprogesterone [CEE + MPA] or placebo) when the estrogen plus progestin intervention (Women's Health Initiative) was stopped. Surveys were mailed 8 to 12 months after the stop date. Logistic regression was used to model vasomotor symptoms and pain or stiffness symptoms as functions of former treatment and baseline symptoms, adjusted for appropriate covariates.

Main Outcome Measures

Symptoms (vasomotor or pain and stiffness) and management strategies.

Results

Respondents' mean (SD) age at trial stop date was 69.1 (6.7) years. They averaged 5.7 years of taking study pills. Moderate or severe vasomotor symptoms after discontinuing study pill use were reported by 21.2% of former CEE + MPA and 4.8% of placebo group respondents overall and by 55.5% and 21.3%, respectively, with these symptoms at baseline (randomization). Compared with respondents in the former placebo group, moderate or severe vasomotor symptoms (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 5.82; 95% confidence interval, 4.92–6.89) and pain or stiffness symptoms (AOR, 2.16; 95% CI, 1.95–2.40) were more likely in respondents in the former CEE + MPA group. Both vasomotor symptoms (AOR, 5.36; 95% CI, 4.51–6.38) and pain or stiffness symptoms (AOR, 3.21; 95% CI, 2.90–3.56) also were more likely in women with these symptoms at baseline. Women reported a wide range of strategies to manage symptoms.

Conclusions

More than half of the women with vasomotor symptoms at randomization to active CEE + MPA also reported these symptoms after discontinuing use of the study pills. However, these participants did not include women who were unwilling to be randomized or who had stopped taking the study pills earlier. These findings should be considered when advising women to treat menopausal symptoms with hormone therapy for as short duration as possible. Investigation of alternative strategies to manage menopausal symptoms is warranted.

### Treatment of symptoms of the menopause: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^115b3CQM]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2015). Medium credibility.

Menopausal hormone therapy — potential preventive effects and limitations — although studies have suggested certain preventive benefits, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force and many expert groups recommend against MHT for primary or secondary disease prevention. Evidence includes reductions in bone loss with ET and an updated WHI analysis reporting a significant reduction in vertebral fractures and a borderline significant reduction for all fractures with EPT in women ages 50 to 59 years, with benefit that may be dose-related. Randomized controlled trials and observational studies reported that MHT reduced the prevalence of self-reported diabetes by 14 to 19%, but this effect did not persist after therapy was discontinued. In clinical trials, EPT was associated with a nonsignificant lower incidence of colorectal cancer in women ages 50 to 59, but cancers that did occur in women receiving EPT were diagnosed at a more advanced stage when all age groups were considered, and the reduction in cancer during active therapy did not persist after discontinuation. During 13 years of cumulative follow-up of the WHI, combined conjugated equine estrogen (CEE) and medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) was associated with a 35% reduction in endometrial cancer in women ages 50 to 59 years (hazard ratio [HR], 0.65; 95% confidence interval, 0.37–1.12).

### Treatment of symptoms of the menopause: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^115TEqN9]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2015). Medium credibility.

Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline — treatment of menopausal symptoms states that menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) is the most effective treatment for vasomotor symptoms and other symptoms of the climacteric, and that benefits clearly exceed risks for the majority of symptomatic postmenopausal women who are under age 60 or under 10 years since the onset of menopause. Health care professionals should individualize therapy based on clinical factors and patient preference, and they should screen women before initiating MHT for cardiovascular and breast cancer risk and recommend the most appropriate therapy depending on risk/benefit considerations. Current evidence does not justify the use of MHT to prevent coronary heart disease, breast cancer, or dementia. For those with vasomotor symptoms who prefer not to use MHT or who have contraindications — because these patients should not use MHT — other options are available; for the genitourinary syndrome of menopause, low-dose vaginal estrogen and ospemifene provide effective therapy, and vaginal moisturizers and lubricants are available for those not choosing hormonal therapy. All postmenopausal women should embrace appropriate lifestyle measures.

### Estrogen and progestogen use in postmenopausal women: 2010 position statement of the North American Menopause Society [^116zFqH3]. Menopause (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To update for both clinicians and the lay public the evidence-based position statement published by The North American Menopause Society (NAMS) in July 2008 regarding its recommendations for menopausal hormone therapy (HT) for postmenopausal women, with consideration for the therapeutic benefit-risk ratio at various times through menopause and beyond.

Methods

An Advisory Panel of clinicians and researchers expert in the field of women's health was enlisted to review the July 2008 NAMS position statement, evaluate new evidence through an evidence-based analysis, and reach consensus on recommendations. The Panel' s recommendations were reviewed and approved by the NAMS Board of Trustees as an official NAMS position statement. Also participating in the review process were other interested organizations who then endorsed the document.

Results

Current evidence supports a consensus regarding the role of HT in postmenopausal women, when potential therapeutic benefits and risks around the time of menopause are considered. This paper lists all these areas along with explanatory comments. Areas that vary from the 2008 position statement are noted. A suggested reading list of key references published since the last statement is also provided.

Conclusions

Recent data support the initiation of HT around the time of menopause to treat menopause-related symptoms; to treat or reduce the risk of certain disorders, such as osteoporosis or fractures in select postmenopausal women; or both. The benefit-risk ratio for menopausal HT is favorable for women who initiate HT close to menopause but decreases in older women and with time since menopause in previously untreated women.

Ovarian cancer — risk modification by contraceptives and menopausal hormone therapy indicates that use of oral contraceptives is associated with a significant reduction in ovarian cancer risk, with risk reduction seen after 1 to 4 years of use and persisting for up to 30 years after discontinuation; by contrast, current and recent use of hormone therapy is associated with a statistically significant but small increased risk in observational studies, with an estimate of one additional ovarian cancer death in 1,700 to 3,300 hormone therapy users, a risk seen with combined EPT and ET that dissipates within 5 years of discontinuing hormone therapy; in the WHI, there was no significant increase in ovarian cancer risk with EPT.

### Role of progestogen in hormone therapy for postmenopausal women: position statement of the North American Menopause Society [^116nHVgh]. Menopause (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To create an evidence-based position statement regarding the role of progestogen in postmenopausal hormone therapy (estrogen plus a progestogen, or EPT) for the management of menopause-related symptoms.

Design

NAMS followed the general principles established for evidence-based guidelines to create this document. Clinicians and researchers acknowledged to be experts in the field of postmenopausal hormone therapy were enlisted to review the evidence obtained from the medical literature and develop a position statement for approval by the NAMS Board of Trustees.

Results

The primary role of progestogen in postmenopausal hormone therapy is endometrial protection. Unopposed estrogen therapy (ET) is associated with a significantly increased risk of endometrial hyperplasia and adenocarcinoma. Adding the appropriate dose and duration of progestogen to ET has been shown to lower that risk to the level found in never-users of ET. The clinical goal of progestogen in EPT is to provide endometrial protection while maintaining estrogen benefits and minimizing progestogen-induced side effects, particularly uterine bleeding. EPT discontinuance correlates with uterine bleeding-women with more days of amenorrhea have higher rates of continuance. All US Food and Drug Administration-approved progestogen formulations will provide endometrial protection if the dose and duration are adequate. Progestogens may diminish the beneficial effects of ET on cardiovascular risk factors. However, no EPT (or ET) regimen should be initiated for the primary or secondary prevention of cardiovascular heart disease. Some progestogens may negatively affect mood. Adding progestogen to ET does not decrease the breast cancer risk, although it does not seem to increase mortality. Progestogen increases mammographic density, which is reversed after discontinuation of use. Progestogen has limited effect on the bone-enhancing action of ET. In general, the side effects of added progestogen are mild, although they may be severe in a small percentage of women.

Conclusions

Progestogen should be added to ET for all postmenopausal women with an intact uterus to prevent the elevated risk of estrogen-induced endometrial hyperplasia and adenocarcinoma. There is no consensus on a preferred regimen for all women. By changing the progestogen type, route, or regimen, clinicians can individualize therapy to minimize side effects, especially uterine bleeding, and limit any effects on ET benefits while providing adequate endometrial protection.

Conclusions

We provided theoretical reasons to expect relevant changes in pharmacokinetics at menopause for many drugs. This expectation was supported by anecdotal evidence from literature. However, research into the menopausal effect on the safety and efficacy of drugs is very scarce and needs to be extended urgently, as for most drugs it is currently unclear if a dose adjustment at menopause is needed.

### The 2022 hormone therapy position statement of the North American Menopause Society [^1173jAbY]. Menopause (2022). High credibility.

Lung cancer — observational studies, including meta-analyses, are conflicting and in aggregate identify no consistent association between hormone therapy use and lung cancer risk, and the effect of hormone therapy on survival is unclear. In the Women's Health Initiative (WHI), during the intervention phase or after a median of 13 years' cumulative follow-up, lung cancer incidence did not differ significantly between placebo and either conjugated equine estrogens (CEE) plus medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) or CEE alone, but in a post hoc analysis of the intervention phase, women treated with CEE plus MPA had more deaths from lung cancer compared with placebo (HR, 1.71; 95% CI, 1.16–2.52). Cancer stage does not seem to be more advanced in women who receive hormone therapy and in whom lung cancer develops, and following discontinuation the potential increased mortality after CEE plus MPA dissipated over time; key points note there appears to be an overall neutral effect on lung cancer incidence and survival, and that smoking cessation should be encouraged with intensive lung cancer surveillance for older smokers, including current or past users of hormone therapy.

### Menopausal hormone therapy and breast cancer: what is the true size of the increased risk? [^112iQV4e]. British Journal of Cancer (2016). Low credibility.

Biases may also occur if analyses included women with simple hysterectomy before menopause (i.e. without oophorectomy) or who started MHT before cessation of menstrual bleeding, as most published cohort and case–control studies have done. We found that the consequent underestimation of the excess HR for combined MHT use, because of not adjusting adequately for menopausal age, was ∼13%. However, women with simple hysterectomy, or those who started MHT before cessation of menstrual bleeding, may be different to women with known age at menopause, and this could be responsible for some or all of the bias.

For the combination of both the above types of bias we found that excess breast cancer risks would be underestimated by 59%. However, the uncertainty around this estimate is large (we estimate 35–83%), and furthermore study-specific characteristics (e.g. when study was conducted, duration of follow-up, etc.) are also likely to affect the size of bias that might be seen in other studies. The misclassification of current use of MHT may be less important in older studies conducted before results were published from the Women's Health Initiative trial and Million Women Study as following these reports women stopped using MHT in large numbers. However, current advice suggests women should use MHT for the shortest possible time, and thus observational studies conducted post 2002/2003 should be cautious about assuming MHT use at baseline will continue for the duration of the study.

### Type and timing of menopausal hormone therapy and breast cancer risk: individual participant meta-analysis of the worldwide epidemiological evidence [^114ykGim]. Lancet (2019). Excellent credibility.

Cases continue to accrue in the prospective studies, but there is no good reason to expect further follow-up would materially alter the main findings for current users. To limit biases, the main analyses were restricted to prospective studies, allowed for early menopause decreasing breast cancer risk and bringing forward the age when MHT is started, and adjusted for various other potential confounding factors (as other correlates of breast cancer risk might also affect the type or timing of MHT use). Current users were included up to no more than 5 years after their last reported MHT use; among them there were, on average, only 1·4 years between the last report about their MHT use and their index date. Some additional use must have occurred during that period, as must some discontinuation, but both have been allowed for (although RRs in current users must still have been slightly weakened by discontinuation before the index date). With all these safeguards, the findings are trustworthy for the main patterns of use in the prospective studies.

The clinical relevance of the main findings lies in the magnitude of the absolute risks during and after MHT use for women who start MHT at ages 40–59 years (figure 7; appendix pp 24–27), but the public health relevance depends additionally on the numbers of women previously and currently exposed. Although use of either type of MHT for less than 1 year was associated with little subsequent risk, for women of average weight in developed countries 5 years of use, starting at age 50 years, would cause an appreciable increase in the probability of developing breast cancer at ages 50–69 years. About half the excess would be during the first 5 years of current use of MHT, and half would be during the next 15 years of past use. The absolute increase would be about 2·0 per 100 women (one in every 50 users) for oestrogen-plus-daily-progestagen MHT, 1·4 per 10 women (one in 70 users) for oestrogen-plus-intermittent-progestagen MHT, and 0·5 per 100 women (one in 200 users) for oestrogen-only MHT. There is little difference in the absolute excess incidence by age 70 associated with starting 5 years of MHT use at ages 45 years, 50 years, or 55 years. Thus, addition of a daily progestagen increases the excess risk of breast cancer from one in 200 users to one in 50 users.

Osteoporosis — During the WHI intervention phase in women of all ages, the CEE plus MPA group had six fewer hip fractures per 10,000 women and six fewer vertebral fractures per 10,000 when compared with the placebo group, and the CEE-alone group had six fewer hip fractures per 10,000 women and six fewer vertebral fractures per 10,000 women compared with the placebo group; however, in the subset of women aged 50 to 59 years at treatment initiation, neither CEE plus MPA nor CEE alone was associated with decreased risk of hip fracture. After hormone therapy discontinuation in the WHI hormone therapy trials, there was a return of fracture risk to levels seen in women who had received placebo, with no excess fracture risk observed after discontinuation, and there are no prospective fracture studies directly comparing hormone therapy with other approved pharmacologic therapies for fracture prevention.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY This American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE)/American College of Endocrinology (ACE) Position Statement is designed to update the previous menopause clinical practice guidelines published in 2011 but does not replace them. The current document reviews new clinical trials published since then as well as new information regarding possible risks and benefits of therapies available for the treatment of menopausal symptoms. AACE reinforces the recommendations made in its previous guidelines and provides additional recommendations on the basis of new data. A summary regarding this position statement is listed below: New information available from randomized clinical trials and epidemiologic studies reported after 2011 was critically reviewed. No previous recommendations from the 2011 menopause clinical practice guidelines have been reversed or changed. Newer information enhances AACE's guidance for the use of hormone therapy in different subsets of women. Newer information helps to support the use of various types of estrogens, selective estrogen-receptor modulators (SERMs), and progesterone, as well as the route of delivery. Newer information supports the previous recommendation against the use of bioidentical hormones. The use of nonhormonal therapies for the symptomatic relief of menopausal symptoms is supported. Newer information enhances AACE's guidance for the use of hormone therapy in different subsets of women. Newer information helps to support the use of various types of estrogens, SERMs, and progesterone, as well as the route of delivery. Newer information supports the previous recommendation against the use of bioidentical hormones. The use of nonhormonal therapies for the symptomatic relief of menopausal symptoms is supported. New recommendations in this position statement include: 1.

Recommendation

the use of menopausal hormone therapy in symptomatic postmenopausal women should be based on consideration of all risk factors for cardiovascular disease, age, and time from menopause. 2.

Recommendation

the use of transdermal as compared with oral estrogen preparations may be considered less likely to produce thrombotic risk and perhaps the risk of stroke and coronary artery disease. 3.

Recommendation

when the use of progesterone is necessary, micronized progesterone is considered the safer alternative. 4.

Recommendation

in symptomatic menopausal women who are at significant risk from the use of hormone replacement therapy, the use of selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors and possibly other nonhormonal agents may offer significant symptom relief. 5.

Recommendation

AACE does not recommend use of bioidentical hormone therapy. 6.

Recommendation

AACE fully supports the recommendations of the Comité de l'Évolution des Pratiques en Oncologie regarding the management of menopause in women with breast cancer. 7.

Recommendation

HRT is not recommended for the prevention of diabetes. 8.

Recommendation

In women with previously diagnosed diabetes, the use of HRT should be individualized, taking in to account age, metabolic, and cardiovascular risk factors.

### Menopausal hormone therapy: current considerations [^114KkBWo]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) is the most effective treatment for vasomotor and vaginal symptoms. Today, symptomatic women younger than 60 years of age or less than 10 years since onset of menopause yield the greatest benefit of MHT with the lowest risks when compared with older women remote from menopause. Careful assessment before initiating therapy includes severity of bothersome symptoms, treatment preferences, medical history, presence of contraindications to MHT, and personal risk of cardiovascular disease and breast cancer. Considerations of type of MHT, dosing, and route of administration, and recommendations regarding duration of therapy are discussed.

### Treatment of symptoms of the menopause: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^113fU5gr]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective of this document is to generate a practice guideline for the management and treatment of symptoms of the menopause.

Participants

The Treatment of Symptoms of the Menopause Task Force included six experts, a methodologist, and a medical writer, all appointed by The Endocrine Society.

Evidence

The Task Force developed this evidenced-based guideline using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system to describe the strength of recommendations and the quality of evidence. The Task Force commissioned three systematic reviews of published data and considered several other existing meta-analyses and trials.

Consensus Process

Multiple e-mail communications, conference calls, and one face-to-face meeting determined consensus. Committees of The Endocrine Society, representatives from endorsing societies, and members of The Endocrine Society reviewed and commented on the drafts of the guidelines. The Australasian Menopause Society, the British Menopause Society, European Menopause and Andropause Society, the European Society of Endocrinology, and the International Menopause Society (co-sponsors of the guideline) reviewed and commented on the draft.

Conclusions

Menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) is the most effective treatment for vasomotor symptoms and other symptoms of the climacteric. Benefits may exceed risks for the majority of symptomatic postmenopausal women who are under age 60 or under 10 years since the onset of menopause. Health care professionals should individualize therapy based on clinical factors and patient preference. They should screen women before initiating MHT for cardiovascular and breast cancer risk and recommend the most appropriate therapy depending on risk/benefit considerations. Current evidence does not justify the use of MHT to prevent coronary heart disease, breast cancer, or dementia. Other options are available for those with vasomotor symptoms who prefer not to use MHT or who have contraindications because these patients should not use MHT. Low-dose vaginal estrogen and ospemifene provide effective therapy for the genitourinary syndrome of menopause, and vaginal moisturizers and lubricants are available for those not choosing hormonal therapy. All postmenopausal women should embrace appropriate lifestyle measures.

### Treatment of symptoms of the menopause: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^112DM7K1]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2015). Medium credibility.

Menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) — evidence on age and timing and use of risk tools: Results showing fewer excess CHD and stroke events when MHT was initiated in younger rather than older study participants in the WHI provide the foundation for the widely accepted consensus that MHT should be initiated primarily in younger women (age < 60 y) close in time (< 10 y) to menopause onset. We feel that methods to integrate these factors to categorize individual risk as minimal, moderate, and high are useful and can be accomplished qualitatively by clinical judgment or quantitatively by risk assessment tools, and country- and population-specific CVD risk calculators are available to quantify individual risk per local guidelines; however, specific cutoffs for the safe use of MHT have not been formally validated, and practice differs from country to country.

### Discontinuation of menopausal hormone therapy and risk of fracture: nested case-control studies using routinely collected primary care data [^111kcseH]. The Lancet: Healthy Longevity (2025). High credibility.

Table 2
Number of extra fractures expected from menopausal hormone therapy use

Compared with never-users, we expect fewer cases among current users: for short-term use, we expect 23 fewer cases per 10 000 women-years for those on oestrogen-only therapy, and 12 fewer cases per 10 000 women-years for those on oestrogen–progestogen therapy; for long-term use, we expect 45 fewer cases per 10 000 women-years for those on oestrogen-only therapy, and 48 fewer cases for those on oestrogen–progestogen therapy. Post-discontinuation — between 1 year and 10 years after — we expect more cases among past users (apart from long-term oestrogen-only users, for which we expect six fewer cases). In the short term, we expect nine more cases for those on oestrogen-only therapy and 14 more cases for those on oestrogen–progestogen therapy and for the long term, we expect five more cases for those on oestrogen–progestogen therapy. At more than 10 years post-discontinuation, we expect fewer cases among past users. For the short term, we expect four fewer cases for those on oestrogen-only therapy and three fewer cases for those on oestrogen–progestogen therapy and for the long term, we expect 20 fewer cases for those on oestrogen-only therapy and 13 fewer cases for those on oestrogen–progestogen therapy.

Diagrammatically, figure 4 presents estimated fracture risk paths for the average woman starting menopausal hormone therapy at the age of about 51·5 years and continuing treatment for short-term or long-term duration. Post-discontinuation, longer-term use initially results in a more severe increase in fracture risk, but later shows a more-attenuated rise in fracture risks compared with shorter-term use. By contrast, the shorter-term use post-discontinuation path has a smaller initial rebound and, although subsequently having a less-attenuated fracture risk increase, importantly commences at an earlier stage of lower risk.

Figure 4
Incidence rate of any fracture by age in women never exposed to menopausal hormone therapy and exposed from the average age of 51·5 years

Short-term use was defined as less than 5 years. Long-term use was defined as 5 years or more.

### Estrogen and progestogen use in postmenopausal women: July 2008 position statement of the North American Menopause Society [^112H6TEs]. Menopause (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To update for both clinicians and the lay public the evidence-based position statement published by The North American Menopause Society (NAMS) in March 2007 regarding its recommendations for menopausal hormone therapy (HT) for postmenopausal women, with consideration for the therapeutic benefit-risk ratio at various times through menopause and beyond.

Design

An Advisory Panel of clinicians and researchers expert in the field of women's health was enlisted to review the March 2007 NAMS position statement, evaluate new evidence through an evidence-based analysis, and reach consensus on recommendations. The Panel's recommendations were reviewed and approved by the NAMS Board of Trustees as an official NAMS position statement. The document was provided to other interested organizations to seek their endorsement.

Results

Current evidence supports a consensus regarding the role of HT in postmenopausal women, when potential therapeutic benefits and risks around the time of menopause are considered. This paper lists all these areas along with explanatory comments. Conclusions that vary from the 2007 position statement are highlighted. Addenda include a discussion of risk concepts, a new component not included in the 2007 paper, and a recommended list of areas for future HT research. A suggested reading list of key references is also provided.

Conclusions

Recent data support the initiation of HT around the time of menopause to treat menopause-related symptoms; to treat or reduce the risk of certain disorders, such as osteoporosis or fractures in select postmenopausal women; or both. The benefit-risk ratio for menopausal HT is favorable close to menopause but decreases with aging and with time since menopause in previously untreated women.

### Discontinuation of hormone therapy and bone mineral density: does physical activity modify that relationship? [^11114AxB]. Menopause (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

Hormone therapy can positively impact bone mineral density after menopause. We explored bone mineral density change in postmenopausal women who discontinued hormone therapy after the Women's Health Initiative landmark 2002 trial results were published. We secondarily explored whether usual physical activity modified the results.

Methods

Postmenopausal women participating in the Buffalo OsteoPerio study with information on hip bone density, hormone therapy use, and self-reported physical activity at two time points (1997–2001; 2002–2007) were included (N = 961). Hormone therapy included three groups according to use at baseline and year 5 (non/non; current/non; current/current).

Results

At baseline (mean age, 65.9 years; SD, 6.7 years), 480 women were not using hormone therapy, while 481 were current users. Between the baseline and 5-year visits, 336 women using hormone therapy discontinued. Baseline total hip bone density was highest in current users. After 5 years, those who continued hormone therapy exhibited no bone loss; those who discontinued exhibited the greatest loss at the total hip of -0.021 gm/cm2. Women who never used hormone therapy exhibited some loss of -0.012 gm/cm2. Usual physical activity did not appreciably impact change in bone density in any group.

Conclusions

This prospective observational study explored the 5-year change in bone mineral density among older postmenopausal women after the landmark 2002 hormone therapy trial findings were released. We found bone density decreased in never-users and in women who discontinued use. Bone density was maintained in current users. Although usual physical activity did not mitigate bone loss, targeted physical activity regimens should be investigated.

### Discontinuation of menopausal hormone therapy and risk of fracture: nested case-control studies using routinely collected primary care data [^115ZXaLQ]. The Lancet: Healthy Longevity (2025). High credibility.

Menopausal hormone therapy users were generally younger and less likely to be from a minority ethnic group and had more records for anxiety (among users, about 24% of cases and about 21% of controls; among non-users, about 16% of cases and about 14% of controls) and prescriptions for antidepressants, proton-pump inhibitors, sedatives, or systemic corticosteroids (appendix pp 6–8).

Overall, compared with never-use, current menopausal hormone therapy use was associated with lower fracture risk (oestrogen-only: OR 0·76 [95% CI 0·74–0·78]; oestrogen–progestogen: 0·75 [0·73–0·76]), discontinuation between 1 year and 10 years before with higher fracture risk (oestrogen-only 0·99 [0·98–1·01]; oestrogen–progestogen 1·06 [1·05–1·08]), and discontinuation more than 10 years before with decreased fracture risk (oestrogen-only: 0·93 [0·91–0·94]; oestrogen–progestogen: 0·95 [0·94–0·96]) (appendix pp 9–10).

Menopause and hormonal replacement — In postmenopausal women, we recommend treating dyslipidemia with statin therapy, rather than hormone therapy; hormone therapy increases the risk of cardiovascular disease, specifically venous thromboembolism and stroke, however, the absolute risk of cardiovascular disease is lower in younger compared to older postmenopausal women, and hormone therapy is described as estrogen ± progesterone/a progestin; in postmenopausal women on hormone therapy and when risk factors for cardiovascular disease, we recommend statin therapy to reduce cardiovascular risk; menopause may be associated with an increase in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and a decrease in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol; risk factors may be traditional risk factors or risk-enhancing factors; in women who enter menopause early (< 40 to 45 years old), we recommend assessment and treatment of lipids and other cardiovascular risk factors; early menopause enhances cardiovascular disease risk and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk should be calculated and followed after menopause.

Medical management Post-PCI

Medical therapy reassessment should be performed post-PCI to ensure that patients are receiving appropriate medical therapy for secondary prevention. In completely revascularized patients, antianginal medications (eg, beta-blockers, nitrates, calcium channel blockers) can often be discontinued, provided they are not needed for other indications. The 2021 ACC/AHA/SCAI Guideline for Coronary Artery Revascularization recommends against beta-blocker use for secondary prevention post-PCI in completely revascularized patients with stable ischemic heart disease and normal left ventricular function. In patients with comorbid conditions (eg, hypertension, atrial fibrillation), appropriate medications for treatment of these conditions should be continued. Given historical associations between menopausal hormone therapy and thrombosis, female, postmenopausal patients might request counseling on its safety post-PCI. With newer agents and transition toward lower doses, shorter duration, and earlier onset of therapy, contemporary evidence suggests venous thrombosis as the main cardiovascular concern related to hormone therapy. However, the ACC CVD in Women Committee recommends that systemic hormone therapy be generally avoided in women with atherosclerotic CVD and that alternative therapy be considered. Low-dose vaginal estrogen therapy is considered safe for all patients, and individualized, shared decision-making can be considered for those with persistent, severe symptoms.

### Cardiovascular risk in menopausal women and our evolving understanding of menopausal hormone therapy: risks, benefits, and current guidelines for use [^116DhHJr]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Women are at increased risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) compared with men. While traditional risk factors for CVD seem to disproportionately affect women and contribute to this disparity, increased prevalence of CVD at midlife calls into question the contribution of menopause. Given the potential role that declining hormone levels play in this transition, menopause hormone therapies (MHT) have been proposed as a strategy for risk factor reduction. Unfortunately, trials have not consistently shown cardiovascular benefit with use, and several describe significant risks. Notably, the timing of hormone administration seems to play a role in its relative risks and benefits. At present, MHT is not recommended for primary or secondary prevention of CVD. For women who may benefit from the associated vasomotor, genitourinary, and/or bone health properties of MHT, CVD risks should be taken into account prior to administration. Further research is needed to assess routes, dosing, and formulations of MHT in order to elucidate appropriate timing for administration. Here, we aim to review both traditional and sex-specific risk factors contributing to increased CVD risk in women with a focus on menopause, understand cardiovascular effects of MHT through a review of several landmark clinical trials, summarize guidelines for appropriate MHT use, and discuss a comprehensive strategy for reducing CV risk in women.

Ovarian cancer — risk signals differ by source and remain uncertain: In the 50- to 59-year age group of the WHI, the HR of ovarian cancer with EPT was 0.30 (two vs six cases; 95% CI, 0.06–1.47), with 1.5 fewer cases/1000 per 5 years of treatment; no data have been reported for ET. A meta-analysis of 52 observational studies showed an increase of 0.52 cases/1000 in women starting MHT at age 50 and continuing therapy for 5 years, with risk persisting 5 years after stopping MHT at 0.37 cases/1000 when ages 55 to 59. Overall WHI estimates for EPT showed HR, 1.41 and in cumulative follow-up HR, 1.24, and adequately powered RCTs are needed to ascertain risk.
