## Question

How about ones for hypothyroidism?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about treatment options for hypothyroidism, including when to treat, what to use, how to dose, how to monitor, and what to do about persistent symptoms. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about distinguishing overt from subclinical hypothyroidism. Then, I should verify the standard of care for overt disease and dosing principles. Next, I will examine the controversy around subclinical hypothyroidism and when treatment is justified. After that, I need to review alternatives like combination therapy and desiccated thyroid, including the evidence and safety. Finally, I should confirm monitoring protocols, special populations, and a practical decision framework, making sure I double-check areas where guidelines conflict or evidence is evolving.

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic categories, because everything downstream depends on getting this right. Overt primary hypothyroidism is defined by an elevated TSH with low free T4, whereas subclinical hypothyroidism is an elevated TSH with normal free T4; central hypothyroidism is different, with inappropriately normal or low TSH and low free T4, and I need to ensure I don't conflate these when choosing targets and tests.

> Now, for overt hypothyroidism, I should confirm the standard of care. Levothyroxine (LT4) monotherapy remains first-line across major guidelines because it reliably normalizes TSH, improves symptoms, and has a favorable safety and pharmacokinetic profile; I initially thought "100% of clinicians use LT4", but wait, let me verify — surveys show 99.2% prefer LT4 monotherapy, with a small minority considering combination therapy, so I should correct that overstatement to be precise [^116szUAB] [^112QYPbZ].

> Next, I should review dosing principles and make sure I anchor them to evidence. Full replacement in adults with minimal endogenous thyroid function is about 1.6 mcg/kg/day of actual body weight, with lower starting doses in older adults or those with cardiac disease; dose adjustments should be based on TSH measured 4–6 weeks after initiation or any change, with typical increments of 12.5–25 mcg, and I need to remember that TSH targets may be relaxed in older patients to avoid overtreatment [^111TwKrq] [^112rVgm7] [^114BCykN] [^117X9d1Y].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about subclinical hypothyroidism. I should double-check the highest-quality evidence. A 2018 JAMA meta-analysis of 21 RCTs with 2192 adults found no improvement in quality of life or thyroid-related symptoms with LT4 in subclinical hypothyroidism, and the 2019 BMJ guideline issues a strong recommendation against routine LT4 for adults with subclinical disease, with exceptions for pregnancy planning, very high TSH, or severe symptoms; importantly, about 37% of people with subclinical hypothyroidism revert to euthyroidism without treatment, so I need to ensure we avoid overtreatment [^115B19e5] [^112XrBR8] [^116EJtt3].

> But wait, what if the TSH is only modestly elevated? I should confirm the thresholds. Many guidelines advise observation when TSH is 4.5–10 mIU/L, reserving treatment for TSH persistently above 10 mIU/L, or if there are risk factors such as positive TPO antibodies, cardiovascular disease, heart failure, or compelling symptoms; however, I need to emphasize that RCTs have not shown symptom benefit even in lower TSH ranges, so shared decision-making is essential here [^112XrBR8] [^1168sTdk] [^115B19e5].

> I will now examine alternatives to LT4 monotherapy, because patients often ask about T3. Combination LT4/LT3 has been studied in multiple RCTs and meta-analyses; results are mixed, with some studies showing transient or small improvements in mental health or preference, but most showing no consistent superiority over LT4 alone, and guidelines generally recommend against routine combination therapy; if considered at all, it should be in selected, persistently symptomatic patients after excluding other causes and used as a time-limited, carefully monitored trial [^113femUC] [^1164Lxwn] [^1155V2B7] [^115a2k8B].

> Let me consider desiccated thyroid extract (DTE). I should confirm safety concerns. DTE provides a fixed T4:T3 ratio that is not physiologic and can cause supraphysiologic T3 peaks; guidelines recommend against routine DTE use due to lack of long-term outcome data and safety concerns, so if a patient is already on DTE and prefers it, I need to monitor closely for iatrogenic hyperthyroidism and adverse effects [^115HDbf5].

> Next, I should review monitoring and targets, and I need to ensure I distinguish primary from central disease. In primary hypothyroidism, TSH is the primary biochemical target, with checks every 4–6 weeks after dose changes until stable, then annually; in central hypothyroidism, TSH is unreliable, so free T4 should be targeted to the mid–upper reference range, and I should double-check that I'm not adjusting based on TSH in central disease [^112rVgm7] [^112GQShE] [^114BCykN].

> I should confirm practical administration details that affect absorption and adherence. LT4 should be taken consistently, ideally 60 minutes before breakfast or at bedtime ≥ 3 hours after the last meal, separated from calcium, iron, soy, and certain antacids; if adherence or absorption is problematic, liquid or gel formulations can improve bioavailability, and I need to remember that switching brands can transiently alter TSH, warranting rechecking [^112VueCg] [^117XdzVq] [^1174XEgy].

> Let me think about special populations, starting with pregnancy. In women who are pregnant or planning pregnancy, especially if TPOAb positive, lower TSH targets are recommended, often < 2.5 mIU/L in the first trimester, with dose increases early in gestation and frequent monitoring; I should confirm that this is where LT4 treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism is actually indicated despite the general recommendation against treatment in nonpregnant adults [^111ipzVk] [^112Cg569].

> For older adults, I should verify that overtreatment carries real risks. Observational data associate both under- and over-replacement with increased mortality, and guidelines advise higher TSH targets in patients over 70, often up to 7.5–10 mIU/L, to mitigate iatrogenic hyperthyroidism and cardiovascular harm; this means I need to titrate more conservatively and accept a higher TSH in the elderly [^1117tFt3] [^117X9d1Y] [^116E5fuv].

> Children and adolescents require prompt, weight-based LT4 therapy with rapid restoration of free T4 to avoid neurodevelopmental sequelae; I should confirm that congenital hypothyroidism mandates treatment within the first 2 weeks of life at 10–15 mcg/kg/day, with close TSH and free T4 monitoring during growth [^111Q9fdy] [^116HVYtP].

> Now, persistent symptoms despite normalized TSH are common, and I need to ensure a structured approach. First, I should verify adherence, absorption, and drug interactions; then evaluate for alternative diagnoses such as depression, anemia, sleep apnea, or menopause; only after that, in carefully selected patients, a time-limited, supervised trial of LT4/LT3 combination may be reasonable, with discontinuation if no clear benefit emerges; I should also remember that measuring T3 in euthyroid patients with vague symptoms is not supported and can mislead management [^1155V2B7] [^115a2k8B] [^116jiqMd].

> Let me synthesize a practical decision framework and double-check it aligns with evidence. For overt hypothyroidism, treat with LT4, titrate to TSH, and monitor periodically. For subclinical hypothyroidism, observe if TSH is 4.5–10 mIU/L, and consider treatment if TSH is > 10 mIU/L or if there are risk factors or compelling symptoms, acknowledging that symptom benefit is uncertain and many patients revert spontaneously. For persistent symptoms on LT4, optimize LT4 first, then consider a cautious, time-limited combination trial in select cases. Throughout, individualize for age, comorbidities, and patient preferences, and avoid overtreatment [^114LBMH9] [^115B19e5] [^115a2k8B].

> Finally, I should confirm key takeaways and ensure internal consistency. LT4 monotherapy remains the evidence-based standard for overt hypothyroidism. Routine LT4 for subclinical hypothyroidism is not supported by high-quality evidence. Combination therapy is not routinely recommended but may be trialed selectively. And careful, TSH-guided monitoring with attention to absorption, adherence, and special populations is essential to minimize undertreatment and iatrogenic harm [^116szUAB] [^114LBMH9] [^1164Lxwn] [^112rVgm7].

For hypothyroidism, **levothyroxine is first-line** [^116szUAB] therapy and is titrated to normalize TSH [^112rVgm7], with full replacement around 1.6 mcg/kg/day [^111TwKrq]. In older adults or those with cardiac disease, **start low and go slow** to avoid ischemia or arrhythmias [^114q7F9o]. Subclinical hypothyroidism is generally not treated unless TSH is > 10 mIU/L or symptoms are significant, as benefits are limited [^114LBMH9] [^115B19e5]. Combination LT4/LT3 is not routine [^1164Lxwn] but may be tried in select patients with persistent symptoms after excluding other causes [^1155V2B7]; monitor closely for adverse effects. Regular TSH monitoring guides dosing, and lifelong therapy is usually required [^1117tFt3].

---

## Standard treatment: levothyroxine monotherapy

- **Levothyroxine (LT4)**: synthetic T4; first-line due to efficacy, safety, and stability [^116szUAB].
- **Dosing**: full replacement ~1.6 mcg/kg/day [^111TwKrq]; adjust to normalize TSH [^112rVgm7].
- **Administration**: take consistently [^112VueCg], fasting, 30–60 min before breakfast or at bedtime ≥ 3 h after last meal; separate from calcium, iron, and some foods.
- **Monitoring**: recheck TSH 4–6 weeks after initiation or dose changes [^112rVgm7], then every 6–12 months when stable [^114BCykN].

---

## Special considerations in dosing

- **Elderly or cardiac disease**: start low (12.5–25 mcg/day) and titrate slowly to avoid ischemia or arrhythmias [^114q7F9o].
- **Pregnancy**: increase dose by ~30% as soon as pregnancy is confirmed; monitor TSH each trimester [^notfound].
- **Drug interactions**: calcium, iron, PPIs, and some foods reduce absorption; separate dosing by several hours [^112VueCg].

---

## Management of subclinical hypothyroidism

Subclinical hypothyroidism is defined by **elevated TSH with normal free T4** [^111trvZ4]. Treatment is **generally not recommended** unless TSH is > 10 mIU/L or symptoms are significant, as benefits are limited [^114LBMH9] [^115B19e5]. When treatment is indicated, use low-dose LT4 and monitor TSH regularly [^111HEjaz].

---

## Alternative therapies

- **Combination LT4/LT3**: not routine [^1164Lxwn]; consider only for persistent symptoms after excluding other causes, with close monitoring [^1155V2B7].
- **Liothyronine (T3) monotherapy**: not recommended due to risk of overtreatment and adverse effects [^114BWuN8].
- **Desiccated thyroid extract**: not preferred due to variable T3/T4 ratios and limited evidence [^115HDbf5].

---

## Monitoring and long-term management

Regular **TSH monitoring** is essential to maintain euthyroidism and avoid under- or overtreatment [^114BCykN]. Lifelong therapy is usually required, with dose adjustments for age, weight, pregnancy, and comorbidities [^113SVBJx]. Patient education on adherence, timing, and interactions improves outcomes [^111mSUzU].

---

## Potential risks and side effects

Overtreatment can cause **iatrogenic hyperthyroidism**, increasing risks of atrial fibrillation, osteoporosis, and anxiety [^11318eHv]. Undertreatment leaves hypothyroid symptoms and cardiovascular risk unresolved [^115sf9qz]. Adverse effects are uncommon with appropriate dosing and monitoring [^116szUAB].

---

Levothyroxine is the cornerstone of hypothyroidism management, with dosing individualized and adjusted to normalize TSH. Combination therapy is reserved for select cases, and **regular monitoring ensures safe, effective lifelong care** [^116szUAB].

### Thyroid hormones treatment for subclinical hypothyroidism: a clinical practice guideline [^114LBMH9]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

Clinical Question

What are the benefits and harms of thyroid hormones for adults with subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH)? This guideline was triggered by a recent systematic review of randomised controlled trials, which could alter practice.

Current Practice

Current guidelines tend to recommend thyroid hormones for adults with thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels > 10 mIU/L and for people with lower TSH values who are young, symptomatic, or have specific indications for prescribing.

Recommendation

The guideline panel issues a strong recommendation against thyroid hormones in adults with SCH (elevated TSH levels and normal free T4 (thyroxine) levels). It does not apply to women who are trying to become pregnant or patients with TSH > 20 mIU/L. It may not apply to patients with severe symptoms or young adults (such as those ≤ 30 years old).

How This Guideline Was Created

A guideline panel including patients, clinicians, and methodologists produced this recommendation in adherence with standards for trustworthy guidelines using the GRADE approach.

The Evidence

The systematic review included 21 trials with 2192 participants. For adults with SCH, thyroid hormones consistently demonstrate no clinically relevant benefits for quality of life or thyroid related symptoms, including depressive symptoms, fatigue, and body mass index (moderate to high quality evidence). Thyroid hormones may have little or no effect on cardiovascular events or mortality (low quality evidence), but harms were measured in only one trial with few events at two years' follow-up.

Understanding The Recommendation

The panel concluded that almost all adults with SCH would not benefit from treatment with thyroid hormones. Other factors in the strong recommendation include the burden of lifelong management and uncertainty on potential harms. Instead, clinicians should monitor the progression or resolution of the thyroid dysfunction in these adults. Recommendations are made actionable for clinicians and their patients through visual overviews. These provide the relative and absolute benefits and harms of thyroid hormones in multilayered evidence summaries and decision aids available in MAGIC (https://app.magicapp.org/) to support shared decisions and adaptation of this guideline.

### Hypothyroidism (primary) [^114BvYSq]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2010). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hypothyroidism is six times more common in women, affecting up to 40/10,000 each year (compared with 6/10,000 men).

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of treatments for clinical (overt) hypothyroidism? What are the effects of treatments for subclinical hypothyroidism? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to September 2009 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found six systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review, we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: levothyroxine, and levothyroxine plus liothyronine.

### Guidelines for the treatment of hypothyroidism: prepared by the American Thyroid Association task force on thyroid hormone replacement [^113yC48n]. Thyroid (2014). Low credibility.

Background

A number of recent advances in our understanding of thyroid physiology may shed light on why some patients feel unwell while taking levothyroxine monotherapy. The purpose of this task force was to review the goals of levothyroxine therapy, the optimal prescription of conventional levothyroxine therapy, the sources of dissatisfaction with levothyroxine therapy, the evidence on treatment alternatives, and the relevant knowledge gaps. We wished to determine whether there are sufficient new data generated by well-designed studies to provide reason to pursue such therapies and change the current standard of care. This document is intended to inform clinical decision-making on thyroid hormone replacement therapy; it is not a replacement for individualized clinical judgment.

Methods

Task force members identified 24 questions relevant to the treatment of hypothyroidism. The clinical literature relating to each question was then reviewed. Clinical reviews were supplemented, when relevant, with related mechanistic and bench research literature reviews, performed by our team of translational scientists. Ethics reviews were provided, when relevant, by a bioethicist. The responses to questions were formatted, when possible, in the form of a formal clinical recommendation statement. When responses were not suitable for a formal clinical recommendation, a summary response statement without a formal clinical recommendation was developed. For clinical recommendations, the supporting evidence was appraised, and the strength of each clinical recommendation was assessed, using the American College of Physicians system. The final document was organized so that each topic is introduced with a question, followed by a formal clinical recommendation. Stakeholder input was received at a national meeting, with some subsequent refinement of the clinical questions addressed in the document. Consensus was achieved for all recommendations by the task force.

Results

We reviewed the following therapeutic categories: (i) levothyroxine therapy, (ii) non-levothyroxine-based thyroid hormone therapies, and (iii) use of thyroid hormone analogs. The second category included thyroid extracts, synthetic combination therapy, triiodothyronine therapy, and compounded thyroid hormones.

Conclusions

We concluded that levothyroxine should remain the standard of care for treating hypothyroidism. We found no consistently strong evidence for the superiority of alternative preparations (e.g., levothyroxine-liothyronine combination therapy, or thyroid extract therapy, or others) over monotherapy with levothyroxine, in improving health outcomes. Some examples of future research needs include the development of superior biomarkers of euthyroidism to supplement thyrotropin measurements, mechanistic research on serum triiodothyronine levels (including effects of age and disease status, relationship with tissue concentrations, as well as potential therapeutic targeting), and long-term outcome clinical trials testing combination therapy or thyroid extracts (including subgroup effects). Additional research is also needed to develop thyroid hormone analogs with a favorable benefit to risk profile.

Levels of scientific substantiation in hypothyroidism in adults clinical practice guidelines — evidence levels for recommendations are defined as: Level 1 "Prospective, randomized, controlled trials — large"; Level 2 "Prospective controlled trials with or without randomization — limited body of outcome data"; Level 3 "Other experimental outcome data and nonexperimental data"; and Level 4 "Expert opinion". Per the table note, "Levels 1, 2, and 3 represent a given level of scientific substantiation or proof. Level 4 or Grade D represents unproven claims". The text also notes that "many recommendations are based on weak scientific data (Level 3) or consensus opinion (Level 4)". Methodologically, the guideline states that "in some grading systems 'should not' implies that there is substantial evidence", yet "the grading method employed in this guideline enables authors to use this language even when the best evidence level available is 'expert opinion'.

### Clinical practice guidelines for hypothyroidism in adults: cosponsored by the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and the American Thyroid Association [^112s547R]. Thyroid (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Hypothyroidism has multiple etiologies and manifestations. Appropriate treatment requires an accurate diagnosis and is influenced by coexisting medical conditions. This paper describes evidence-based clinical guidelines for the clinical management of hypothyroidism in ambulatory patients.

Methods

The development of these guidelines was commissioned by the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) in association with American Thyroid Association (ATA). AACE and the ATA assembled a task force of expert clinicians who authored this article. The authors examined relevant literature and took an evidence-based medicine approach that incorporated their knowledge and experience to develop a series of specific recommendations and the rationale for these recommendations. The strength of the recommendations and the quality of evidence supporting each was rated according to the approach outlined in the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists Protocol for Standardized Production of Clinical Guidelines-2010 update.

Results

Topics addressed include the etiology, epidemiology, clinical and laboratory evaluation, management, and consequences of hypothyroidism. Screening, treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism, pregnancy, and areas for future research are also covered.

Conclusions

Fifty-two evidence-based recommendations and subrecommendations were developed to aid in the care of patients with hypothyroidism and to share what the authors believe is current, rational, and optimal medical practice for the diagnosis and care of hypothyroidism. A serum thyrotropin is the single best screening test for primary thyroid dysfunction for the vast majority of outpatient clinical situations. The standard treatment is replacement with L-thyroxine. The decision to treat subclinical hypothyroidism when the serum thyrotropin is less than 10 mIU/L should be tailored to the individual patient.

American Thyroid Association hypothyroidism guideline development — methods report the task force was commissioned and approved by ATA officers, formed in the summer of 2011, and included mechanistic and translational science experts (four members), clinical thyroidology experts (six members), a pediatric endocrinology member, a health research evaluation member, and a bioethicist. The task force met face to face in October 2011, June 2012, September 2012, June 2013, October 2013, and June 2014 with seven interim discussions using conference calls, and held a spring meeting open to stakeholders on April 25 and 26, 2013. Members identified 42 questions relevant to hypothyroidism treatment; for each question the literature was reviewed by a primary reviewer who drafted a recommendation, which was then reviewed by a secondary reviewer.

Thyroid hormone analog therapy in euthyroid individuals with non–hypothyroid-related medical conditions — For the question "Should thyroid hormone analog therapy be used in euthyroid individuals with non–hypothyroid-related medical conditions (such as dyslipidemia) based on current evidence?", the guideline states "we recommend against the use of such drugs outside of the research setting" because of "the lack of clear benefit or excessive side effects of currently available preparations", with "Strong recommendation. Low-quality evidence".

Children with subclinical hypothyroidism — many clinicians consider it reasonable to initiate levothyroxine to avoid potential risk to growth and development, but treatment is generally not recommended when thyrotropin is 5–10 mIU/L; for thyrotropin > 10 mIU/L with signs and symptoms of primary thyroid disease and/or risk factors for progression, levothyroxine may be reasonable. Weak recommendation. Low-quality evidence.

### Hypothyroidism [^114GYrqH]. Lancet (2017). Excellent credibility.

Hypothyroidism is a common condition of thyroid hormone deficiency, which is readily diagnosed and managed but potentially fatal in severe cases if untreated. The definition of hypothyroidism is based on statistical reference ranges of the relevant biochemical parameters and is increasingly a matter of debate. Clinical manifestations of hypothyroidism range from life threatening to no signs or symptoms. The most common symptoms in adults are fatigue, lethargy, cold intolerance, weight gain, constipation, change in voice, and dry skin, but clinical presentation can differ with age and sex, among other factors. The standard treatment is thyroid hormone replacement therapy with levothyroxine. However, a substantial proportion of patients who reach biochemical treatment targets have persistent complaints. In this Seminar, we discuss the epidemiology, causes, and symptoms of hypothyroidism; summarise evidence on diagnosis, long-term risk, treatment, and management; and highlight future directions for research.

### American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists medical guidelines for clinical practice for the evaluation and treatment of hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism [^116BQ3o2]. Endocrine Practice (2004). Low credibility.

These clinical practice guidelines summarize the recommendations of the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists for the diagnostic evaluation of hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism and for treatment strategies in patients with these disorders. The sensitive thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH or thyrotropin) assay has become the single best screening test for hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism, and in most outpatient clinical situations, the serum TSH is the most sensitive test for detecting mild thyroid hormone excess or deficiency. Therapeutic options for patients with Graves' disease include thyroidectomy (rarely used now in the United States), antithyroid drugs (frequently associated with relapses), and radioactive iodine (currently the treatment of choice). In clinical hypothyroidism, the standard treatment is levothyroxine replacement, which must be tailored to the individual patient. Awareness of subclinical thyroid disease, which often remains undiagnosed, is emphasized, as is a system of care that incorporates regular follow-up surveillance by one physician as well as education and involvement of the patient.

Levothyroxine therapy for hypothyroidism — levothyroxine is recommended as the preparation of choice for the treatment of hypothyroidism due to its efficacy in resolving the symptoms of hypothyroidism, long-term experience of its benefits, favorable side effect profile, ease of administration, good intestinal absorption, long serum half-life, and low cost. Strong recommendation. Moderate quality evidence.

T3 measurement and therapy in biochemically euthyroid but symptomatic patients — A survey found that 22% of clinicians would measure serum T3 levels when faced with a biochemically euthyroid patient with persistent symptoms, yet no published studies have demonstrated that relatively low T3 levels have negative consequences for patients with normal serum TSH values, so this remains an untested hypothesis. Although there has been an increase in the use of LT3 therapy in the United States over the last 10 years, a 2011 survey reported that 3.6% of physicians would consider prescribing LT3 in such circumstances. An individual trial of T3 therapy to normalize serum T3 without lowering TSH below normal is unsupported by data and is an unproven approach; some task force members thought it could be considered on individual basis as innovative therapy, but when such treatments are used repeatedly they should become the object of formal research to determine safety and effectiveness, and outside a trial it is difficult to assess desired response and uncontrolled experience does not establish effectiveness.

Inadequate levothyroxine — harms and treatment goal: "The adverse effects of thyroid hormone deficiency include detrimental effects on the serum lipid profile and progression of cardiovascular disease. We recommend that patients with overt hypothyroidism be treated with doses of levothyroxine that are adequate to normalize serum thyrotropin levels, in order to reduce or eliminate these undesirable effects. Strong recommendation. Moderate quality evidence".

### How do you approach the problem of TSH elevation in a patient on high-dose thyroid hormone replacement? [^114JDqUJ]. Clinical Endocrinology (2009). Low credibility.

Persistent elevation of TSH levels in patients under treatment for hypothyroidism is a relatively common clinical problem in endocrinology practice. The most common cause for this phenomenon is poor patient compliance with their thyroid hormone tablets. In the compliant patient, however, multiple aetiologies are possible and a methodological and stepwise approach to the patient's problem will uniformly identify a cause, or at least a resolution.

### Should we treat for subclinical hypothyroidism? grand rounds discussion from beth Israel deaconess medical center [^115xMkqo]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

In May 2015, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force issued a guideline on screening for thyroid disease that included a systematic evidence review and an update of its 2004 recommendations. The review assessed the effect of treating screen-detected subclinical thyroid dysfunction on health outcomes. It found adequate evidence that treating subclinical hypothyroidism does not provide clinically meaningful improvements in blood pressure, body mass index, bone mineral density, lipid levels, or quality-of-life measures. The review also concluded that evidence was inadequate to determine whether screening for thyroid dysfunction reduced cardiovascular disease or related morbidity and mortality. In separate guidelines, the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and American Thyroid Association advocated aggressive case-finding and recommended screening persons with certain clinical conditions or characteristics rather than the general population. These societies argue that subclinical hypothyroidism adversely affects cardiovascular outcomes and thus merits case-finding. Here, 2 experts discuss their perspectives on whether treating subclinical hypothyroidism reduces morbidity and mortality, whether there are harms of treatment, and how they would balance the benefits and harms of treatment both in general and for a specific patient.

Combination LT4, LT3 treatment in primary hypothyroidism — randomized evidence and outcomes are summarized as follows: In adults with primary hypothyroidism, 13 original RCTs were reviewed, with treatment durations ranging from 5 weeks to 1 year and the majority 6 months or shorter; females accounted for 80% or more of participants in specific trials; seven had a cross-over design and the rest a parallel design; all included trials had some level of blinding except for one study. Effects on thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) varied: eight studies found no difference versus LT4 alone, two reported significantly higher TSH with combination therapy, and two reported significantly lower TSH, including suppression to 0.07 mIU/L in a highest dose combination group using a 5:1 ratio of LT4 to LT3. Health-related quality-of-life/mood results across 13 trials were heterogeneous, with two trials showing marked superiority of combination treatment on multiple measures, two showing superiority on a minority of measurements (including improvements at 3 months but not 12 months in one trial), and eight trials showing no statistically significant superiority over LT4.

However, the study's methodology is not without weaknesses. One significant issue is the high heterogeneity observed in some outcomes, suggesting substantial variability across studies, which could stem from differences in study populations, interventions, or methodologies. This raises questions about the generalizability of the findings. Furthermore, by excluding studies not published in English, the study potentially overlooks significant research, introducing language bias and raising concerns about publication bias, particularly regarding studies with negative or inconclusive results. These strengths and weaknesses collectively highlight the study's comprehensive yet somewhat restricted approach to evaluating thyroid hormone therapies.

### Association of thyroid hormone therapy with quality of life and thyroid-related symptoms in patients with subclinical hypothyroidism: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115B19e5]. JAMA (2018). Excellent credibility.

Importance

The benefit of thyroid hormone therapy for subclinical hypothyroidism is uncertain. New evidence from recent large randomized clinical trials warrants an update of previous meta-analyses.

Objective

To conduct a meta-analysis of the association of thyroid hormone therapy with quality of life and thyroid-related symptoms in adults with subclinical hypothyroidism.

Data Sources

PubMed, EMBASE, ClinicalTrials.gov, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, CENTRAL, Emcare, and Academic Search Premier from inception until July 4, 2018.

Study Selection

Randomized clinical trials that compared thyroid hormone therapy with placebo or no therapy in nonpregnant adults with subclinical hypothyroidism were eligible. Two reviewers independently evaluated eligibility based on titles and abstracts of all retrieved studies. Studies not excluded in this first step were independently assessed for inclusion after full-text evaluation by 2 reviewers.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Two independent reviewers extracted data, assessed risk of bias (Cochrane risk-of-bias tool), and evaluated the quality of evidence (GRADE tool). For synthesis, differences in clinical scores were transformed (eg, quality of life) into standardized mean differences (SMDs; positive values indicate benefit of thyroid hormone therapy; 0.2, 0.5, and 0.8 correspond to small, moderate, and large effects, respectively). Random-effects models for meta-analyses were applied.

Main Outcomes and Measures

General quality of life and thyroid-related symptoms after a minimum follow-up of 3 months.

Results

Overall, 21 of 3088 initially identified publications met the inclusion criteria, with 2192 adults randomized. After treatment (range, 3–18 months), thyroid hormone therapy was associated with lowering the mean thyrotropin value into the normal reference range compared with placebo (range, 0.5–3.7 mIU/L vs 4.6 to 14.7 mIU/L) but was not associated with benefit regarding general quality of life (n = 796; SMD, -0.11; 95% CI, -0.25 to 0.03; I² = 66.7%) or thyroid-related symptoms (n = 858; SMD, 0.01; 95% CI, -0.12 to 0.14; I² = 0.0%). Overall, risk of bias was low and the quality of evidence assessed with the GRADE tool was judged moderate to high.

Conclusions and Relevance

Among nonpregnant adults with subclinical hypothyroidism, the use of thyroid hormone therapy was not associated with improvements in general quality of life or thyroid-related symptoms. These findings do not support the routine use of thyroid hormone therapy in adults with subclinical hypothyroidism.

### Guidelines for the treatment of hypothyroidism: prepared by the American Thyroid Association task force on thyroid hormone replacement [^11318eHv]. Thyroid (2014). Medium credibility.

American Thyroid Association hypothyroidism — levothyroxine replacement goals in primary hypothyroidism are as follows: Levothyroxine replacement therapy has three main goals. These are (i) to provide resolution of the patients' symptoms and hypothyroid signs, including biological and physiologic markers of hypothyroidism, (ii) to achieve normalization of serum thyrotropin (TSH) with improvement in thyroid hormone concentrations, and (iii) to avoid overtreatment (iatrogenic thyrotoxicosis), especially in the elderly. The goals of LT4 replacement in primary hypothyroidism are to achieve a state of euthyroidism and normalization of the circulating levels of TSH and thyroid hormones, with euthyroidism defined as the normalization of indices of thyroid hormone action and the absence or the regression of symptoms and clinical signs associated with hypothyroidism. The lack of specificity of hypothyroid symptoms and signs, and particularly in autoimmune thyroid disease, renders difficult the assessment of the adequacy of the replacement therapy on a purely clinical basis. A randomized controlled trial demonstrated that patients are unable to detect differences in symptoms when the LT4 dose is changed by approximately 20%, although such a change was sufficient to modify cholesterol levels. Strong recommendation. Moderate quality evidence.

### Hypothyroidism: an update… [^112qkTRq]. AAFP (2012). Low credibility.

Hypothyroidism is defined as failure of the thyroid gland to produce sufficient thyroid hormone to meet the metabolic demands of the body. Untreated hypothyroidism can contribute to hypertension, dyslipidemia, infertility, cognitive impairment, and neuromuscular dysfunction. Data derived from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey suggest that about one in 300 persons in the United States has hypothyroidism. 1 The prevalence increases with age, and is higher in females than in males. 2 It is estimated that nearly 13 million Americans have undiagnosed hypothyroidism. 3 Hypothyroidism may occur as a result of primary gland failure or insufficient thyroid gland stimulation by the hypothalamus or pituitary gland. Primary gland failure can result from congenital abnormalities, autoimmune destruction, iodine deficiency, and infiltrative diseases. Autoimmune thyroid disease is the most common etiology of hypothyroidism in the United States.

Central causes of hypothyroidism typically present with other manifestations of hypothalamic or pituitary dysfunction, and are characterized by inappropriately normal or low levels of TSH relative to insufficient thyroid hormone. Drugs classically associated with thyroid dysfunction include lithium, amiodarone, interferon alfa, interleukin-2, and tyrosine kinase inhibitors. These include weight gain, fatigue, poor concentration, depression, diffuse muscle pain, and menstrual irregularities. Symptoms with high specificity for hypothyroidism include constipation, cold intolerance, dry skin, proximal muscle weakness, and hair thinning or loss.
8. Symptoms of hypothyroidism may vary with age and sex. Infants and children may present more often with lethargy and failure to thrive. Women who have hypothyroidism may present with menstrual irregularities and infertility. In older patients, cognitive decline may be the sole manifestation.

Examination findings associated with hypothyroidism include but are not limited to goiter, delayed relaxation phase of deep tendon reflexes, thin or brittle hair, dry skin, and peripheral edema. SUBCLINICAL HYPOTHYROIDISM Subclinical hypothyroidism is a biochemical diagnosis defined by a normal-range free T. MYXEDEMA COMA Myxedema coma is a rare but extremely severe manifestation of hypothyroidism that most commonly occurs in older women who have a history of primary hypothyroidism. Mental status changes including lethargy, cognitive dysfunction, and even psychosis, and hypothermia are the hallmark features of myxedema coma.

1 Introduction

Hypothyroidism is estimated to affect around 3% of the population in Europe, and is more common in certain groups such as females and older adults. Clinically, hypothyroidism presents with symptoms such as cold intolerance, fatigue, and weight gain. Biochemically, hypothyroidism is diagnosed through measurement of thyroid‐stimulating hormone (TSH) and free thyroxine (FT4), with increased TSH and decreased FT4 the typical pattern seen in patients with overt hypothyroidism. Additionally, there exists a subset of the population with high TSH levels but normal FT4 and no or minimal symptoms; this is known as subclinical hypothyroidism.

The most prescribed treatment for hypothyroidism is levothyroxine (LT4) monotherapy, with this medication being converted into the more metabolically active thyroid hormone, triiodothyronine (T3), by deiodinases within the body. LT4 is a very widely prescribed drug, with 33.8 million prescriptions in the UK alone in 2022. Other thyroid hormone treatments, such as natural desiccated thyroid (NDT) and liothyronine (LT3) are available but are used much less commonly in modern practice.

The ideal therapeutic goal in hypothyroidism would be to restore clinical and biochemical euthyroidism via physiologic thyroid hormone replacement. This concept may seem straightforward, but there are subtleties that have only recently been recognised. In the majority of patients, LT4 treatment will both normalise TSH levels and lead to symptom resolution. However, it is estimated that around 5%–15% of patients taking LT4 still experience symptoms of hypothyroidism, even with normalised TSH levels. This may be due to LT4 monotherapy not restoring T3 levels to the normal range in a subset of patients, perhaps due to polymorphisms within the genes which encode peripheral deiodinase enzymes.

Additionally, multiple studies suggest that as many as 40% of patients taking LT4 have TSH levels outside of the normal range, indicating under‐ or over‐replacement of thyroid hormones. Certain patient factors, such as sex, age, and duration of treatment, may influence this under‐ or over‐treatment. Significantly, both under‐ and over‐treatment of hypothyroidism are associated with increased all‐cause mortality.

This study aims to investigate further the differences in thyroid hormone levels and health outcomes in people on thyroid hormone replacement therapy compared with people being screened for thyroid disorder and not taking levothyroxine. Better understanding of the relation between thyroid hormone replacement therapy and actual levels of TSH, Free T3 (FT3), and FT4 in patients could allow more tailored and effective therapy for people with hypothyroidism.

### Primary hypothyroidism… [^111oyTAQ]. AAFP (2015). Low credibility.

Primary hypothyroidism is defined as low levels of blood thyroid hormone due to destruction of the thyroid gland. This destruction is usually caused by autoimmunity or an intervention such as surgery, radioiodine, or radiation. It can be classified as clinical when diagnosed by characteristic clinical features, raised levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone, and reduced levels of thyroxine hypothyroidism is diagnosed on the basis of characteristic clinical features, a serum TSH above the reference range, and T. 4 below the reference range.

A number of guidelines quote serum TSH of 5 to 10 mU per L as mild hypothyroidism, and greater than 10 mU per L as severe hypothyroidism. Subclinical hypothyroidism is a biochemical diagnosis with findings of a serum TSH above the reference range and serum T 4 within the reference range. Primary hypothyroidism occurs after destruction of the thyroid gland because of autoimmunity or medical intervention such as surgery, radioiodine, or radiation. Secondary hypothyroidism occurs after pituitary or hypothalamic damage and is caused by insufficient production due to pituitary or hypothalamic hypofunction. Secondary hypothyroidism is not covered in this review. Euthyroid sick syndrome is diagnosed when T 3 levels are low, serum T 4 is low, and TSH levels are normal or low. Euthyroid sick syndrome is not covered in this review.

If both a raised TSH level and antithyroid antibodies were present, the OR for women was 38, and the OR for men was 173. Subclinical hypothyroidism is associated with depression. Persons with subclinical hypothyroidism may have depression that is refractory to antidepressant drugs and thyroid hormone alone. Memory impairment, hysteria, anxiety, somatic complaints, and depressive features without depression have been described in persons with subclinical hypothyroidism.

### Evaluating the effectiveness of combined T4 and T3 therapy or desiccated thyroid versus T4 monotherapy in hypothyroidism: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116P44TG]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Our meta-analysis provides a comprehensive evaluation of thyroid hormone replacement therapies in hypothyroidism, revealing that combined T4 + T3 therapy and desiccated thyroid extract (DTE) offer distinct biochemical profiles compared to T4 monotherapy yet do not significantly impact a range of clinical outcomes. Notably, combined therapy does not alter TSH levels but significantly affects total T4 and T3 levels, suggesting specific biochemical changes without corresponding clinical benefits regarding lipid profile, cardiovascular risk markers, and quality of life measures. However, a significant improvement in mental health and well-being with combined therapy emerges as a potential benefit, highlighting the need for personalized treatment strategies. The observed high heterogeneity across studies underscores the complexity of thyroid hormone therapy and the importance of individual patient factors in treatment decisions, paving the way for more tailored and nuanced approaches to managing hypothyroidism.

### Use of liothyronine (T3) in hypothyroidism: joint British thyroid association / society for endocrinology consensus statement [^1155V2B7]. Clinical Endocrinology (2023). Medium credibility.

Persistent symptoms in patients treated for hypothyroidism are common. Despite more than 20 years of debate, the use of liothyronine for this indication remains controversial, as numerous randomised trials have failed to show a benefit of treatment regimens that combine liothyronine (T3) with levothyroxine over levothyroxine monotherapy. This consensus statement attempts to provide practical guidance to clinicians faced with patients who have persistent symptoms during thyroid hormone replacement therapy. It applies to non-pregnant adults and is focussed on care delivered within the UK National Health Service, although it may be relevant in other healthcare environments. The statement emphasises several key clinical practice points for patients dissatisfied with treatment for hypothyroidism. Firstly, it is important to establish a diagnosis of overt hypothyroidism; patients with persistent symptoms during thyroid hormone replacement but with no clear biochemical evidence of overt hypothyroidism should first have a trial without thyroid hormone replacement. In those with established overt hypothyroidism, levothyroxine doses should be optimised aiming for a TSH in the 0.3–2.0 mU/L range for 3 to 6 months before a therapeutic response can be assessed. In some patients, it may be acceptable to have serum TSH below reference range (e.g. 0.1–0.3 mU/L), but not fully suppressed in the long term. We suggest that for some patients with confirmed overt hypothyroidism and persistent symptoms who have had adequate treatment with levothyroxine and in whom other comorbidities have been excluded, a trial of liothyronine/levothyroxine combined therapy may be warranted. The decision to start treatment with liothyronine should be a shared decision between patient and clinician. However, individual clinicians should not feel obliged to start liothyronine or to continue liothyronine medication provided by other health care practitioners or accessed without medical advice, if they judge this not to be in the patient's best interest.

Hypothyroidism treatment — future research priorities include strategies to avoid iatrogenic thyroid disease in treated individuals and to aid compliance with levothyroxine (LT4) therapy, and a better understanding of maternal-fetal physiology during pregnancy with development of improved titration of LT4 for hypothyroid pregnant patients. Additional needs are further studies of soft gel LT4 capsules; further study and improved standardization of compounded formulations of LT4 and/or liothyronine (LT3); development of additional biomarkers of euthyroidism, which may supplement the use of serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) as a biomarker; and improved understanding of how triiodothyronine (T3) levels are affected by age and disease status with reference ranges indexed to age and health status, including clarification of the relative importance of maintaining specific serum T3 concentrations. Research is encouraged into the relationship between serum T3 and T3 concentrations in specific tissues; development of more accurate assays to measure serum concentrations of free triiodothyronine (FT3), total T3, and free thyroxine (FT4); development of a sustained release T3 preparation that can be prospectively tested in clinical trials, e.g., in combination with LT4 in a physiologic ratio of about 14:1; and, if such a preparation is unavailable, studying when, if ever, the use of LT3 would be beneficial in selected patients with apparent decreased T4 to T3 conversion and disproportionately low serum T3 levels. Long-term outcome research using thyroid extracts that includes documentation of the consequences of excursions in serum T3 concentrations, development of thyroid hormone (TH) analogs with a favorable benefit to risk profile, and pursuit of research into developing thyroid stem cells as a potential avenue for understanding thyrocyte physiology and as a possible future treatment for hypothyroidism are also identified.

### Role of levothyroxine / liothyronine combinations in treating hypothyroidism [^112Chvgh]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Diverse causes potentially underlie decreased quality of life in biochemically euthyroid patients treated for hypothyroidism with levothyroxine. Once these contributing factors are addressed, if symptoms persist, there may be benefit to personalized use of combination therapy adding liothyronine. This approach should be carefully monitored: avoiding overtreatment and ensuring that therapy is only continued if it improves patient-reported quality of life. Most randomized clinical trials have not shown benefits, perhaps because of not targeting the most symptomatic patients. Sustained-release liothyronine preparations may soon be available for optimally designed studies assessing whether combination therapy provides superior therapy for hypothyroidism in select patients.

Hypothyroidism therapy — biomarkers, tissue euthyroidism, and combination therapy uncertainties note that replication of the endogenous circadian rhythm in T3 may also optimize therapy, but current exogenous therapies do not reproduce endogenous serum T3 excursions or serum T3 rhythms. LT4 therapy results in a higher serum T4/T3 ratio than in the nonthyroidic state, and it is not known whether there is a detrimental effect of this abnormal serum T4/T3 ratio. Serum TSH is considered to be the best marker currently available, yet normal serum TSH may be documented despite biochemical parameters indicating tissue hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism, and the biologic activity of serum TSH is not always concordant with its measured concentrations. Animal studies show that a normal serum T3 is not necessarily accompanied by a normal T3 concentration in all tissues, and commercially available tests to indicate tissue status in humans are not available. In combination therapy studies, a study that appeared to show a benefit at 3 months no longer showed maintenance of this benefit at 12 months, and the serum T3 response has not been rigorously assessed in many trials with restoration of serum T3 to "normal" generally not an endpoint.

### American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and American college of endocrinology position statement on thyroid dysfunction case finding [^113SKFsA]. Endocrine Practice (2016). Low credibility.

Hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism can be readily diagnosed and can be treated in a safe, cost-effective manner. Professional organizations have given guidance on how and when to employ thyroid-stimulating hormone testing for the detection of thyroid dysfunction. Most recently, the United States Preventive Services Task Force did not endorse screening for thyroid dysfunction based on a lack of proven benefit and potential harm of treating those with thyroid dysfunction, which is mostly subclinical disease. The American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) is concerned that this may discourage physicians from testing for thyroid dysfunction when clinically appropriate. Given the lack of specificity of thyroid-associated symptoms, the appropriate diagnosis of thyroid disease requires biochemical confirmation. The Thyroid Scientific Committee of the AACE has produced this White Paper to highlight the important difference between screening and case-based testing in the practice of clinical medicine. We recommend that thyroid dysfunction should be frequently considered as a potential etiology for many of the nonspecific complaints that physicians face daily. The application and success of safe and effective interventions are dependent on an accurate diagnosis. We, therefore, advocate for an aggressive case-finding approach, based on identifying those persons most likely to have thyroid disease that will benefit from its treatment.

Combination therapy with levothyroxine and liothyronine for primary hypothyroidism — In adults requiring thyroid hormone replacement treatment for primary hypothyroidism, there is no consistently strong evidence of superiority of combination therapy over monotherapy with levothyroxine, and we recommend against the routine use of combination treatment with levothyroxine and liothyronine as a form of thyroid hormone replacement therapy in patients with primary hypothyroidism based on conflicting results of benefits from randomized controlled trials comparing this therapy to levothyroxine therapy alone and a paucity of long-term outcome data.

A detailed description of the grading scheme has been published elsewhere. Recommendations were based on published findings and on expert opinion when appropriate. The best available research evidence was used to develop recommendations. Preference was given to articles written in English, identified by PubMed searches with MeSH terms.

For each point, recommendations and evidence are described, with a modification in the grading evidence as follows: 1 = strong recommendation (applies to most patients in most circumstances, benefits clearly outweigh the risk); and 2 = weak recommendation (consensus opinion of working group or should be considered; the best action may depend on circumstances or patient values, benefits, and risks closely balanced or uncertain).

Qualify of evidence is indicated as follows: ⊕⊕⊕, high quality (prospective cohort studies or randomized controlled trials at low risk of bias); ⊕⊕○, moderate quality (observational studies or trials with methodological flaws, inconsistent or indirect evidence); and ⊕○○, low quality (case series or nonsystematic clinical observations).

### Guidelines for the treatment of hypothyroidism: prepared by the American Thyroid Association task force on thyroid hormone replacement [^112GQShE]. Thyroid (2014). Medium credibility.

Levothyroxine therapy in secondary hypothyroidism — biochemical goals: In patients with secondary hypothyroidism, the primary biochemical treatment goal should be to maintain the serum free thyroxine (FT4) values in the upper half of the reference range; however, the serum free thyroxine target level may be reduced in older patients or patients with comorbidities who may be at higher risk of complications of thyroid hormone excess. Strong recommendation. Moderate quality evidence. Secondary (central) hypothyroidism is characterized by insufficient pituitary production of TSH and affects 1:100,000 individuals; when the etiology is a pituitary deficit of TSH this indicator can no longer be employed, and serum TSH is an unreliable indicator that may become undetectable with small increments in LT4 that still leave the serum FT4 in the hypothyroid range, thus an alternative measure of thyroid status may be required.

American Thyroid Association guideline — levothyroxine (LT4) dose requirements and modifiers are summarized as follows: Based on body weight, hypothyroid patients with minimal endogenous thyroid function require LT4 doses of 1.6–1.8 µg/kg of actual body weight, with some studies estimating 2.0–2.1 µg/kg for some patient groups, and LT4 doses in thyroid cancer patients requiring thyrotropin (TSH) suppression are on the order of 2.1–2.7 µg/kg. Ideal body weight is reported as a better predictor of LT4 dose than actual body weight, women treated for hypothyroidism typically require an increase in LT4 dose early in the first trimester of pregnancy, and LT4 replacement doses tend to decrease with age when titrated based on serum TSH; the presence of the type 2 deiodinase gene (DIO2) Thr92Ala polymorphism has produced inconsistent findings.

### Treatment with thyroid hormone [^111mSUzU]. Endocrine Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Thyroid hormone deficiency can have important repercussions. Treatment with thyroid hormone in replacement doses is essential in patients with hypothyroidism. In this review, we critically discuss the thyroid hormone formulations that are available and approaches to correct replacement therapy with thyroid hormone in primary and central hypothyroidism in different periods of life such as pregnancy, birth, infancy, childhood, and adolescence as well as in adult patients, the elderly, and in patients with comorbidities. Despite the frequent and long term use of l-T4, several studies have documented frequent under- and overtreatment during replacement therapy in hypothyroid patients. We assess the factors determining l-T4 requirements (sex, age, gender, menstrual status, body weight, and lean body mass), the major causes of failure to achieve optimal serum TSH levels in undertreated patients (poor patient compliance, timing of l-T4 administration, interferences with absorption, gastrointestinal diseases, and drugs), and the adverse consequences of unintentional TSH suppression in overtreated patients. Opinions differ regarding the treatment of mild thyroid hormone deficiency, and we examine the recent evidence favoring treatment of this condition. New data suggesting that combined therapy with T3 and T4 could be indicated in some patients with hypothyroidism are assessed, and the indications for TSH suppression with l-T4 in patients with euthyroid multinodular goiter and in those with differentiated thyroid cancer are reviewed. Lastly, we address the potential use of thyroid hormones or their analogs in obese patients and in severe cardiac diseases, dyslipidemia, and nonthyroidal illnesses.

### Optimal thyroid hormone replacement [^115a2k8B]. Endocrine Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Hypothyroidism is a common endocrinopathy, and levothyroxine is frequently prescribed. Despite the basic tenets of initiating and adjusting levothyroxine being agreed on, there are many nuances and complexities to consistently maintaining euthyroidism. Understanding the impact of patient weight and residual thyroid function on initial levothyroxine dosage and consideration of age, comorbidities, thyrotropin goal, life stage, and quality of life as levothyroxine is adjusted can be challenging and continually evolving. Because levothyroxine is a lifelong medication, it is important to avoid risks from periods of overtreatment or undertreatment. For the subset of patients not restored to baseline health with levothyroxine, causes arising from all aspects of the patient's life (coexistent medical conditions, stressors, lifestyle, psychosocial factors) should be broadly considered. If such factors do not appear to be contributing, and biochemical euthyroidism has been successfully maintained, there may be benefit to a trial of combination therapy with levothyroxine and liothyronine. This is not supported by the majority of randomized clinical trials, but may be supported by other studies providing lower-quality evidence and by animal studies. Given this discrepancy, it is important that any trial of combination therapy be continued only as long as a patient benefit is being enjoyed. Monitoring for adverse effects, particularly in older or frail individuals, is necessary and combination therapy should not be used during pregnancy. A sustained-release liothyronine preparation has completed phase 1 testing and may soon be available for better designed and powered studies assessing whether combination therapy provides superior therapy for hypothyroidism.

### Guidelines for the treatment of hypothyroidism: prepared by the American Thyroid Association task force on thyroid hormone replacement [^114BWuN8]. Thyroid (2014). Medium credibility.

LT3-only therapy for hypothyroidism — evidence, safety, and monitoring: At the present time there is insufficient evidence to suggest that LT3-only therapy is a safe and efficacious treatment of hypothyroidism in the general population, and currently there is no evidence that LT3-only therapy is cost-effective relative to the standard of care represented by LT4. The LT3-only therapy appears more favorable for patients affected by dyslipidemia and obesity, but at the present time there is not sufficient evidence that this modality is superior to the standard LT4 therapy, and presently no data are available on the long-term effects of LT3-only therapy. Although not recommended, if used, LT3-only therapy should be monitored with measurements of fasting serum TSH levels before the administration of the dose, aiming to target serum TSH within the lower tertile of the reference range, and for dose adjustment it may be helpful to measure serum T3 levels in the morning (trough) and 2 hours after the administration of the dose (peak), aiming to maintain the values within the reference range; serum FT4 assessment is of no value in this scenario.

### Critical approach to hypothyroid patients with persistent symptoms [^115gM4sL]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Hypothyroidism is a common condition, and numerous studies have been published over the last decade to assess the potential risks associated with this disorder when inappropriately treated. The standard of care for treatment of hypothyroidism remains levothyroxine (LT4) at doses to achieve biochemical and clinical euthyroidism. However, about 15% of hypothyroid patients experience residual hypothyroid symptoms. Some population-based studies and international population-based surveys have confirmed dissatisfaction with LT4 treatment in some hypothyroid patients. It is well established that hypothyroid patients treated with LT4 exhibit higher serum thyroxine:triiodothyronine ratios and can have a persistent increase in cardiovascular risk factors. Moreover, variants in deiodinases and thyroid hormone transporter genes have been associated with subnormal T3 concentrations, persistent symptoms in LT4-treated patients, and improvement in response to the addition of liothyronine to LT4 therapy. The American (ATA) and European Thyroid Association (ETA) guidelines have recently evolved in their recognition of the potential limitations of LT4. This shift is reflected in prescribing patterns: Physicians' use of combination therapy is prevalent and possibly increasing. Randomized clinical trials have recently been published and, while they have found no improvement in treating hypothyroid patients, a number of important limitations did not allow generalizability. Meta-analyses have reported a preference rate for combination therapy in 46.2% hypothyroid patients treated with LT4. To promote discussions about an optimal study design, the ATA, ETA, and British Thyroid Association have recently published a consensus document. Our study provides a useful counterpoint on the controversial benefits of treating hypothyroid patients with combination therapy.

### Thyroid replacement therapy, thyroid stimulating hormone concentrations, and long term health outcomes in patients with hypothyroidism: longitudinal study [^1117tFt3]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Hypothyroidism is a highly prevalent global health problem that can substantially affect patients' wellbeing. Lifelong treatment with thyroid hormone (replacement therapy) is needed when the diagnosis of persistent thyroid hormone deficiency is confirmed; consequently, levothyroxine is one of the most commonly prescribed drugs in Western countries, and this is likely to increase further in the foreseeable future.

Long term adverse health outcomes in patients with thyroid dysfunction and treatment targets to optimise these outcomes, generally monitored by serial measurements of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), have been extensively investigated. In particular, the cardiovascular effect of thyroid dysfunction and the negative ramifications of clinical (overt) thyroid hypofunction, mediated by changes in systemic vascular resistance, hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia, and accelerated atherosclerosis, are well documented. One of the targets for treatment with thyroid hormone replacement is to reverse such adverse effects. Current guidelines in Europe and the US recommend that replacement therapy should be aimed at resolving symptoms and achieving "normalisation" of TSH. However, no specific optimal target for TSH exists in the context of thyroid hormone replacement. This uncertainty is reflected in the guidelines proposed by the American Thyroid Association Task Force and the statement issued by the British Thyroid Association Executive Committee, which suggest a wide range for TSH, 0.4–4.0 mIU/L, as an indication for optimal replacement, after emphasising the scarcity of relevant evidence. TSH concentrations in this wide target range may be achieved by different doses of levothyroxine. However, from a physiological standpoint, a continuum of effects may plausibly occur across the spectrum of normal TSH concentrations; the same human heart might behave differently at a pace dictated by a TSH concentration of 0.4 mIU/L compared with one of 4 mIU/L, both of which are considered normal. Evidence indicates that TSH and circulating thyroid hormone concentrations are quite tightly regulated on an individual basis, but determining an individual's set point is not part of routine clinical practice, and replacement treatment is generally targeted in a wide reference range.

### How selective are the new guidelines for treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism for patients with thyrotropin levels at or below 10 mIU / L? [^114WgkfX]. Thyroid (2013). Low credibility.

Background

By consensus, a thyrotropin (TSH) level persistently > 10mIU/L is an indication for the treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH). Controversy exists regarding patients whose TSH level is elevated but < 10mIU/L. Recently, the American Thyroid Association (ATA) and the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) published their position about factors that should be considered in the decision on treating SCH. This study evaluated the frequency of these factors among adult (non-pregnant) women with SCH whose TSH levels are ≤ 10mIU/L.

Methods

The presence of the conditions that should be considered for the treatment of SCH according to ATA and AACE was evaluated in 252 women who were diagnosed with SCH and had TSH levels ≤ 10mIU/L. Pregnant women were excluded.

Results

Antithyroperoxidase antibodies (TPOAbs) were detected in 137 (54.3%) women. A high cardiovascular risk was observed in 43 (17%) women. Eighty (31.7%) women who were not at high cardiovascular risk presented at least one classical risk factor (arterial hypertension, elevated level of low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol or low level of high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, smoking, or first-degree family history of premature coronary artery disease). At least one symptom or sign of hypothyroidism that could not be explained by another condition was observed in 180 (71.4%) women. Two hundred thirty-two (92%) women had positive TPOAbs, or at least one classical cardiovascular risk factor, or at least one symptom or sign of hypothyroidism.

Conclusions

According to the new ATA and AACE guidelines, L-T4 therapy would be considered for 92% of women with SCH and TSH ≤ 10mIU/L.

### Time for a reassessment of the treatment of hypothyroidism [^113irk8e]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2019). Medium credibility.

Despite a historically late start in its recognition as a disease entity, hypothyroidism has remarkably become one of the most frequently diagnosed diseases in the Western world, and levothyroxine one of the most frequently used drugs worldwide.

How could a condition that had been overlooked throughout the centuries of human culture rise to such prominence in such a short time period? Clearly, this was related to the convenient and sensitive measurement of serum TSH, which has achieved a pre-eminent position in defining primary hypothyroidism. Consequently, a new disease class of subclinical hypothyroidism was introduced, which is solely based on the presence of an elevated TSH while the thyroid hormones FT3 and FT4 remain within their respective reference ranges. This strategy has not remained unchallenged and the deficiencies of this diagnostic approach have been reviewed elsewhere. In an attempt to scale back on the avalanche of purported thyroid diseases created by this strategy, the TSH threshold for treatment was raised in recent guidelines. In doing so, another problem was created by dissociating the TSH-based diagnosis of the disease from the requirement of therapeutic intervention. However, doctors and patients find it incomprehensible that a thyroid condition labelled as a disease would not therefore require suitable intervention. This questions the practical value of designation and appropriateness of the current diagnostic entity of subclinical hypothyroidism.

Hypothyroidism treated with levothyroxine (LT4) — serum triiodothyronine (T3) levels relative to thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) normalization are described as follows: Patients with hypothyroidism treated with levothyroxine to achieve normal serum TSH values may have serum triiodothyronine concentrations that are at the lower end of the reference range, or even below the reference range, and the clinical significance of this is unknown. LT4 is an effective, convenient, and cost-effective treatment for hypothyroidism. The evidence base includes at least eight studies examining serum T3 levels in humans being treated with LT4, although only two were prospective. In cross-sectional comparisons, despite similar TSH values, LT4-treated patients had significantly lower T3 concentrations than controls.

### Treating hypothyroidism is not always easy: when to treat subclinical hypothyroidism, TSH goals in the elderly, and alternatives to levothyroxine monotherapy [^116E5fuv]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

The majority of patients with hypothyroidism feel better when levothyroxine treatment restores thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) concentrations to normal. Increasingly, a significant minority of patients remain symptomatic and are dissatisfied with their treatment. Overzealous treatment of symptomatic patients with subclinical hypothyroidism may contribute to dissatisfaction among hypothyroidism patients, as potential hypothyroid symptoms in patients with minimal hypothyroidism rarely respond to treatment. Thyroid hormone prescriptions have increased by 30% in the United States in the last decade. The diagnosis of subclinical hypothyroidism should be confirmed by repeat thyroid function tests ideally obtained at least 2 months later, as 62% of elevated TSH levels may revert to normal spontaneously. Generally, treatment is not necessary unless the TSH exceeds 7.0–10 mIU/L. In double-blinded randomized controlled trials, treatment does not improve symptoms or cognitive function if the TSH is less than 10 mIU/L. While cardiovascular events may be reduced in patients under age 65 with subclinical hypothyroidism who are treated with levothyroxine, treatment may be harmful in elderly patients with subclinical hypothyroidism. TSH goals are age dependent, with a 97.5 percentile (upper limit of normal) of 3.6 mIU/L for patients under age 40, and 7.5 mIU/L for patients over age 80. In some hypothyroid patients who are dissatisfied with treatment, especially those with a polymorphism in type 2 deiodinase, combined treatment with levothyroxine and liothyronine may be preferred.

### Canadian endocrinologists' perspectives on treatment with thyroid hormone substitutions in euthyroid and hypothyroid patients: a 2023 THESIS questionnaire survey [^113bVAsD]. Clinical Endocrinology (2025). Medium credibility.

An extensive survey conducted in twenty‐eight European countries, known as THESIS (Treatment of Hypothyroidism in Europe by Specialists: An International Survey), examined endocrinologists′ prescribing preferences for patients with persistent symptoms. In some countries, up to 40% would consider LT4 + LT3 for patients with persistent hypothyroid symptoms despite normalization of thyrotropin (TSH). In contrast, only a few considered DTE in the treatment of hypothyroid patients. Reasons for reluctance to prescribe DTE include the insufficient evidence demonstrating its superiority compared to LT4 therapy, the paucity of studies investigating potential adverse effects, both in the short and the long term, as well as DTE′s unavailability in most European countries.

At variance with European countries, DTE is approved for use in Canada, which may influence local prescribing patterns. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate Canadian endocrinologists′ perspectives regarding hypothyroidism treatment via a nationwide Canadian survey as part of the international THESIS project. Understanding physicians′ treatment preferences is crucial as they affect patient experience and outcomes, contribute to data on practice variation, and identify areas for further research to improve the treatment of hypothyroidism.

### Italian Association of Clinical Endocrinologists statement-replacement therapy for primary hypothyroidism: a brief guide for clinical practice [^117XdzVq]. Endocrine Practice (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

Hypothyroidism requires life-long thyroid hormone replacement therapy in most patients. Oral levothyroxine (LT4) is an established safe and effective treatment for hypothyroidism, but some issues remain unsettled.

Methods

The Italian Association of Clinical Endocrinologists appointed a panel of experts to provide an updated statement for appropriate use of thyroid hormone formulations for hypothyroidism replacement therapy. The American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists' protocol for standardized production of clinical practice guidelines was followed.

Results

LT4 is the first choice in replacement therapy. Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) should be maintained between 1.0 and 3.0 mIU/L in young subjects and at the upper normal limit in elderly or fragile patients. Achievement of biochemical targets, patient well-being, and adherence to treatment should be addressed. In patients with unstable serum TSH, a search for interfering factors and patient compliance is warranted. Liquid or gel formulations may be considered in subjects with hampered LT4 absorption or who do not allow sufficient time before or after meals and LT4 replacement. Replacement therapy with LT4 and L-triiodothyronine (LT3) combination is generally not recommended. A trial may be considered in patients with normal values of serum TSH who continue to complain of symptoms of hypothyroidism only after co-existent nonthyroid problems have been excluded or optimally managed. LT3 should be administered in small (LT4:LT3 ratio, 10:1 to 20:1) divided daily doses. Combined therapy should be avoided in elderly patients or those with cardiac risk factors and in pregnancy.

Conclusion

LT4 therapy should be aimed at resolution of symptoms of hypothyroidism, normalization of serum TSH, and improvement of quality of life. In selected cases, the use of liquid LT4 formulations or combined LT4/LT3 treatment may be considered to improve adherence to treatment or patient well-being.

### Central hypothyroidism: advances in etiology, diagnostic challenges, therapeutic targets, and associated risks [^1116i226]. Endocrine Practice (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

Central hypothyroidism is a rare disorder resulting from impaired thyroid hormone production due to deficiencies in TSH secretion from the pituitary or TRH secretion from the hypothalamus. This review aims to summarize recent advances in the etiology, diagnosis, and treatment of central hypothyroidism, with an emphasis on diagnostic and therapeutic challenges.

Methods

A comprehensive review of the literature was conducted, focusing on genetic and acquired causes, particularly those related to hypothalamic-pituitary tumors and the effects of surgical and radiotherapeutic interventions. Diagnostic approaches and treatment strategies, including levothyroxine therapy and monitoring, are analyzed.

Results

Early diagnosis requires simultaneous measurement of free T4 and TSH to prevent neurological sequelae, especially in congenital cases. Central hypothyroidism is associated with risks such as growth and developmental impairment, as well as metabolic and cardiovascular disturbances. Levothyroxine therapy is crucial for correcting hormonal deficits and improving patient outcomes; however, careful dosing is necessary to avoid potential complications, particularly in vulnerable populations.

Conclusions

Personalized treatment and continuous monitoring are essential to optimize clinical outcomes and enhance the quality of life in affected individuals. A thorough understanding of central hypothyroidism's etiology and management is necessary to improve early detection and therapeutic strategies.

While TSH levels may decline within a month of initiating therapy with doses of L‑thyroxine such as 50 or 75 μg, making adjustments with smaller doses may require 8 weeks or longer before TSH levels begin to plateau, and increment changes of 12.5–25 μg are initially made. Once an adequate replacement dosage has been determined, periodic follow‑up evaluations with repeat TSH testing at 6‑month and then 12‑month intervals are appropriate, and some clinical manifestations of hypothyroidism may take up to 3–6 months to resolve after serum TSH has returned to normal.

ATA/AACE hypothyroidism — initial L‑thyroxine dosing: With initial thyroid hormone replacement, replacement therapy requires approximately 1.6 μg/kg of L‑thyroxine daily; patients who are athyreotic and those with central hypothyroidism may require higher doses, while patients with subclinical hypothyroidism or after treatment for Graves' disease may require less. In subclinical hypothyroidism, doses of 25–75 μg daily are usually sufficient for achieving euthyroid levels. One randomized controlled trial assigned starting doses by baseline thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) as 25 μg for TSH 4.0–8.0 mIU/L, 50 μg for TSH 8–12 mIU/L, and 75 μg for TSH > 12 mIU/L, and after 2 months only minimal further adjustments were required to achieve euthyroidism.

3.0 Treatment and Monitoring of CH

3.1 Initial treatment and therapeutic regimens

Recommendations

3.1.1 L-T 4 alone is recommended as the treatment of choice for CH (1|⊕⊕○).

3.1.2 Treatment with L-T 4 should be started as soon as possible, and no later than the first 2 weeks of life or immediately after confirmatory serum test results in infants identified in a second routine screening test. We recommend an initial L-T 4 dose of 10 to 15 μg/kg per day. Infants with severe disease, as defined by a very low pretreatment TT 4 or FT4 concentration, should be treated with the highest initial dose, and those with a mild to moderate hypothyroidism with a lower dose (1|⊕⊕○).

3.1.3 L-T 4 should be administered orally. If oral administration is not possible, it can also be administered iv, in which case the iv dose should be no more than 80% the oral dose. The dose should then be adjusted according to TSH and FT4 determinations (1|⊕⊕○).

3.1.4 We recommend the administration of L-T 4 in tablet form. In neonates and infants, the tablets can be crushed and administered via a small spoon, with suspension, if necessary, in a few milliliters of water or breast milk. L-T 4 can also be administered in liquid form, but only if pharmaceutically produced and licensed L-T 4 solutions are available (1|⊕⊕○). A brand rather than a generic formulation is recommended in CH, at least in infancy (2|⊕⊕○).

3.1.5 L-T 4 can be administered or taken in the morning or evening, either before feeding or with food, but it should be administered in the same way every day. The dose should then be adjusted according to TSH and FT4 determinations to establish the appropriate dose in each setting. Caution should be taken with the administration of vitamin D during the first weeks of life, and the intake of soy, iron, and calcium at the time of L-T 4 administration should be avoided (1|⊕⊕⊕).

3.1.6 Parents should be provided with written instructions on L-T 4 treatment to avoid uncertainties that might hinder compliance (1|⊕○○).

### ETA guidelines for the use of levothyroxine sodium preparations in monotherapy to optimize the treatment of hypothyroidism [^117X9d1Y]. European Thyroid Journal (2025). High credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for hypothyroidism, more specifically with respect to TSH monitoring, ETA 2025 guidelines recommend to recognize that serum TSH increases with age. Consider individualizing treatment based on the patient's age and degree of comorbidities. Consider adopting a more relaxed TSH reference interval in patients aged > 70 years with levothyroxine-treated hypothyroidism.

### A 2013 survey of clinical practice patterns in the management of primary hypothyroidism [^112QYPbZ]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2014). Low credibility.

Context

In 2012, comprehensive clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) were published regarding the management of hypothyroidism.

Objective

We sought to document current practices in the management of primary hypothyroidism and compare these results with recommendations made in the 2012 American Thyroid Association (ATA)/American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) hypothyroidism CPGs. In addition, we sought to examine differences in management among international members of U.S.-based endocrine societies and to compare survey results with those obtained from a survey of ATA members performed 12 years earlier.

Methods

Clinical members of The Endocrine Society (TES), the ATA, and the AACE were asked to take a web-based survey consisting of 30 questions dealing with testing, treatment, and modulating factors in the management of primary hypothyroidism.

Results

In total, 880 respondents completed the survey, including 618 members of TES, 582 AACE members, and 208 ATA members. North American respondents accounted for 67.6%, Latin American 9.7%, European 9.2%, Asia and Oceania 8.1%, and Africa and Middle East 5.5%. Overt hypothyroidism would be treated using l-T4 alone by 99.2% of respondents; 0.8% would use combination l-T4 and liothyronine (l-T3) therapy. Generic l-T4 would be used by 49.3% and a brand name by 49.9%. The rate of replacement would be gradual (38.5%); an empiric dose, adjusted to achieve target (33.6%); or a calculated full replacement dose (27.8%). A target TSH of 1.0 to 1.9 mU/L was favored in the index case, but 3.0 to 3.9 mU/L was the most commonly selected TSH target for an octogenarian. Persistent hypothyroid symptoms despite achieving a target TSH would prompt testing for other causes by 84.3% of respondents, a referral to primary care by 11.3%, and a change to l-T4 plus l-T3 therapy by 3.6%. Evaluation of persistent symptoms would include measurement of T3 levels by 21.9% of respondents. Subclinical disease with a TSH 5.0 to 10.0 mU/L would be treated without further justification by 21.3% of respondents, or in the presence of positive thyroid peroxidase antibodies (62.3%), hypothyroid symptoms (60.9%), high low-density lipoprotein (52.9%), or goiter (46.6%). The TSH target for a newly pregnant patient was < 2.5 mU/L for 96.1% of respondents, with 63.5% preferring a TSH target < 1.5 mU/L. Thyroid hormone levels would be checked every 4 weeks during pregnancy by 67.7% and every 8 weeks by an additional 21.4%. A hypothyroid patient with TSH of 0.5 mU/L who becomes pregnant would receive an immediate l-T4 dose increase by only 36.9% of respondents.

Conclusion

The current survey of clinical endocrinologists catalogs current practice patterns in the management of hypothyroidism and demonstrates 1) a nearly exclusive preference for l-T4 alone as initial therapy, 2) the widespread use of age-specific TSH targets for replacement therapy, 3) a low threshold for treating mild thyroid failure, 4) meticulous attention to TSH targets in the pregnant and prepregnant woman, and 5) a highly variable approach to both the rate and means of restoring euthyroidism for overt disease. Both alignment and focal divergence from recent CPGs are demonstrated.

4 Discussion

4.1 Clinical Indications for Treatment with Thyroid Hormones

In line with international guidelines, this survey confirms that LT4 is the preferred treatment among Canadian endocrinologists for patients with hypothyroidism.

Approximately half of the respondents believed that thyroid hormones are never warranted in treatment‐naïve, biochemically euthyroid patients. However, one‐third would consider thyroid hormone therapy for euthyroid women with infertility associated with high thyroid antibody levels. Similarly, 42% of thyroid experts across European countries would also support treatment in these patients. This variation in practice may reflect the recommendation of the 2017 ATA guideline to consider low‐dose LT4 treatment for thyroid peroxidase antibody (TPOAb)‐positive euthyroid women undergoing assisted conception, given its potential benefits in improving pregnancy success compared to limited risk. However, more recent systematic reviews and meta‐analyses of randomized controlled trials have found no benefit of LT4 in euthyroid women with thyroid autoimmunity, whether pregnant or planning pregnancy, irrespective of the use of assisted conception. Furthermore, an ongoing discussion over the years on the definition of the reference range of thyroid function tests in pregnancy might also affect the response to this question. International guidelines recommend local population‐ and pregnancy‐specific reference intervals for TSH and free T4, according to the laboratory assays used, even though this is not feasible for most centers. Therefore, many centers use the nonpregnant TSH upper reference limit of 4.0 mU/L, a value that may not be applied uncritically to pregnant women.

A mere 7.4% of Canadian endocrinologists indicated prescribing LT4 for patients with a growing goiter, compared to one‐third of European endocrinologists. This different European attitude, more evident in its Eastern regions, could be due to the former presence of areas of low‐iodine intake in which the treatment with thyroid hormones was reported as beneficial for nodular goiter. Accumulating evidence over the past decades has led to abandoning this treatment option based on a lack of clinically significant efficacy.

Overall, treating euthyroid individuals with LT4 has potential risks, and previous studies have shown associations with suppressed TSH in hypothyroid individuals and increased morbidity and mortality. Several factors might explain why physicians adhere to outdated treatment practices, including healthcare resources, patient‐related factors (expectations, age, and culture), and physician characteristics (age, gender, and work institution). This emphasizes the need for a greater focus on disseminating the latest research and guidelines to encourage physicians to follow evidence‐based practices.

### Subclinical thyroid disease: clinical applications [^111trvZ4]. JAMA (2004). Excellent credibility.

Subclinical hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism are diagnoses based on laboratory evaluation with few if any clinical signs or symptoms. Subclinical hypothyroidism is defined as an elevation in serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) above the upper limit of the reference range (0.45–4.5 mIU/L) with normal serum FT4 concentration; subclinical hyperthyroidism is defined as a decrease in serum TSH below the reference range with normal serum FT4 and T3 concentrations. Though these conditions represent the earliest stages of thyroid dysfunction, the benefits of detecting and treating subclinical thyroid disease are not well established. Most persons found to have subclinical thyroid disease will have TSH values between 0.1 and 0.45 mIU/L or between 4.5 and 10 mIU/L, for which the benefits of treatment are not clearly established; treatment may be beneficial in individuals with serum TSH lower than 0.1 mIU/L or higher than 10 mIU/L. This article illustrates approaches to managing patients with subclinical hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism through 5 case scenarios that apply the principles of evidence-based medicine. Because of the substantial uncertainty concerning the consequences of untreated subclinical hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism, as well as the benefit of initiating treatment, patient preferences are important in deciding on management of subclinical disease.
