## Question

Can breastfeeding be safely continued while taking antidepressant medications?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether breastfeeding can be safely continued while taking antidepressant medications. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the baseline risks of untreated maternal depression versus the potential risks of antidepressant exposure via breast milk. Then, I should verify what high-quality guidelines say about first-line treatments in breastfeeding mothers. Next, I will examine drug-specific lactation safety data and pharmacokinetic principles that influence infant exposure. After that, I need to outline practical monitoring and risk-mitigation strategies. Finally, I will synthesize a clear recommendation and highlight exceptions where breastfeeding may need to be modified or deferred, ensuring shared decision-making throughout.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame: untreated postpartum depression is common and carries substantial risks for both mother and infant, including impaired bonding, infant developmental delays, and maternal functional impairment, so I need to ensure we do not under-treat depression out of concern about medication exposure alone [^1146xCsW] [^112FzG5e] [^1133EmTG]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should also verify that the benefits of breastfeeding are well established and that abrupt weaning can worsen maternal mood and infant outcomes, reinforcing the need to balance risks and benefits rather than default to stopping either treatment or breastfeeding [^notfound].

> Next, I should review guideline direction. ACOG advises not to withhold or discontinue mental health medications solely due to pregnancy or lactation, and the VA/DoD guideline recommends evidence-based psychotherapy as first-line for mild to moderate peripartum depression, with antidepressants considered when symptoms are moderate to severe, prior response supports their use, or psychotherapy is declined or unavailable [^1137CZhw] [^112ZRJNe] [^113EDv9X]. Wait, let me verify the ABM position as well; ABM Clinical Protocol #18 similarly supports individualized risk–benefit analysis and prioritizes treating maternal depression while supporting breastfeeding when feasible, which aligns with this approach [^113C5nTw] [^115PZ8bW].

> I will now examine drug-specific lactation safety. Sertraline is generally preferred as a first-line SSRI in breastfeeding because infant serum levels are typically very low and adverse effects are uncommon; pooled data show infant serum levels around 2% of maternal levels on average, with a range up to about 15%, and no adverse reactions observed in the pooled cohort, which is reassuring though not absolute [^113Xb6Jq] [^112CTLb6]. Paroxetine and nortriptyline also tend to have low infant serum detectability and are reasonable options when clinically indicated, whereas citalopram and fluoxetine more often produce higher relative infant doses and occasional reports of infant somnolence or poor feeding, so I should be more cautious with those agents or consider dose minimization and monitoring if they must be used [^112CTLb6] [^116kQQAf]. But wait, what if I need an SNRI? Venlafaxine and duloxetine have limited lactation data; venlafaxine exposure via milk is generally low and duloxetine's relative infant dose is often under 1% of the maternal weight-adjusted dose, suggesting compatibility in many cases with monitoring, though data are sparser than for SSRIs [^117Vfju7] [^11393DHk] [^116bTWCi].

> Let me consider pharmacokinetic principles that modulate exposure. Medications with higher protein binding, shorter half-life, lower lipophilicity, and lower oral bioavailability in infants tend to result in less clinical exposure, and infant age and maturity of hepatic/renal clearance matter; neonates under 2 months are more vulnerable to CNS-active drugs, so I should adjust monitoring accordingly and, when possible, dose the mother just after a feed or before the infant's longest sleep interval to reduce peak milk concentrations [^115EG58w] [^112G4tmg] [^114C7YVs]. Hold on, I should verify that ABM echoes this timing strategy; yes, ABM supports post-feed dosing to reduce exposure, which is a practical, low-risk mitigation step [^113Cy13K].

> Next, I should review monitoring and follow-up. I need to ensure coordination between maternal and pediatric clinicians, with infant monitoring focused on growth, feeding, sleep, and neurobehavioral status in the first weeks to months; routine infant serum drug levels are not indicated without clinical concern, but if the infant shows poor feeding, excessive somnolence, irritability, or growth faltering, I should reassess the regimen and consider switching agents or adjusting the plan [^113Cy13K] [^112G4tmg]. Hmm, wait a minute, I almost said to check infant levels routinely; that would be over-testing in most cases, and guidelines advise against routine serum monitoring unless there is a specific indication, so I should correct that and keep monitoring clinical rather than laboratory unless there is a compelling reason [^113Cy13K] [^111SeuKf].

> I should double-check special circumstances. For women who were stable on an antidepressant during pregnancy, continuing the same agent postpartum is often sensible because postnatal milk exposure is typically lower than placental exposure, and changing drugs can destabilize mood; however, if the prior agent is high risk for infant effects (for example, doxepin), switching to a better-supported alternative like sertraline may be prudent [^116tK8WY] [^1119cCpC]. For severe postpartum presentations such as postpartum psychosis, breastfeeding may need to be deferred while acute treatment and safety stabilization are prioritized, especially when medications with higher infant risk or sedation are required, with resumption considered once the mother is stabilized and the regimen is safer for the dyad [^115PZ8bW] [^113spB2W]. Hold on, I should verify that ABM acknowledges lactation status should not delay necessary treatment; yes, ABM emphasizes that treatment should not be delayed solely due to breastfeeding, reinforcing the priority of maternal stabilization [^115PZ8bW].

> Let me synthesize the practical approach. For mild to moderate symptoms, start with psychotherapy (CBT or IPT) and monitor closely; if symptoms persist or are moderate to severe, initiate an antidepressant with favorable lactation data, preferentially sertraline, paroxetine, or nortriptyline, consider continuing a previously effective agent, use the lowest effective dose, dose after feeds when feasible, and implement coordinated infant monitoring for growth and behavior, adjusting therapy if concerns arise [^112ZRJNe] [^115PZ8bW] [^113Cy13K]. I need to ensure shared decision-making that weighs maternal relapse risk, breastfeeding goals, and medication-specific infant exposure, using authoritative resources like LactMed and ABM protocols to support counseling and reduce unnecessary weaning or undertreatment [^117LA1sH] [^112G4tmg].

> Final answer: Yes, breastfeeding can usually be safely continued while taking antidepressant medications, particularly with SSRIs such as sertraline, paroxetine, or nortriptyline, using individualized risk–benefit assessment, dose and timing strategies to minimize exposure, and close infant monitoring; avoid abrupt weaning and prioritize treating maternal depression, while exercising more caution with agents like citalopram or fluoxetine and deferring breastfeeding only in exceptional circumstances such as acute postpartum psychosis or when high-risk medications are unavoidable [^113Xb6Jq] [^112CTLb6] [^1137CZhw] [^113spB2W].

Breastfeeding can continue while taking antidepressants, but **individualized risk–benefit assessment** is essential [^113C5nTw]. Sertraline, paroxetine, and nortriptyline are preferred due to low infant exposure and favorable safety profiles [^112CTLb6]; fluoxetine and citalopram are less favored because of higher infant exposure and rare adverse effects [^112CTLb6]. Monitor infants for sedation, poor feeding, and irritability, and coordinate care with the pediatrician [^113Cy13K]. If medication is needed, **treat maternal depression** because untreated illness poses greater risks to mother and infant than antidepressant exposure via breast milk [^1137CZhw] [^115PZ8bW].

## Antidepressants commonly prescribed during breastfeeding

Among antidepressants commonly prescribed during breastfeeding, **selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)** — sertraline, paroxetine, fluoxetine, citalopram, and escitalopram — are frequently used; sertraline and paroxetine have low infant exposure and are preferred, whereas fluoxetine and citalopram have higher exposure and are less favored [^112CTLb6] [^113Xb6Jq]. Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) such as venlafaxine and duloxetine are also used; venlafaxine has low infant exposure, and duloxetine exposure appears low but data are limited [^117Vfju7] [^11393DHk]. Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) like nortriptyline and amitriptyline have low infant exposure and are considered compatible with breastfeeding [^1119cCpC] [^1155khFy].

## Safety of antidepressants during breastfeeding

### SSRIs

- **Sertraline**: Low infant exposure; preferred SSRI during breastfeeding [^112CTLb6] [^113Xb6Jq].
- **Paroxetine**: Low infant exposure; preferred SSRI during breastfeeding [^112CTLb6].
- **Fluoxetine**: Higher infant exposure; use cautiously, especially in infants under 2 months [^112CTLb6] [^1119cCpC].
- **Citalopram**: Higher infant exposure; rare reports of infant somnolence and poor feeding [^116kQQAf] [^112CTLb6].

---

### SNRIs

Venlafaxine has low infant exposure and is **generally considered safe**, whereas duloxetine shows low infant exposure in limited data but warrants cautious use given fewer available data [^117Vfju7] [^11393DHk].

---

### TCAs

Nortriptyline has low infant exposure and is **compatible with breastfeeding** [^1119cCpC], and amitriptyline is likewise compatible, with low infant exposure reported [^1155khFy].

---

## Potential risks and benefits

### Risks associated with antidepressant use during breastfeeding

Potential risks include **infant exposure to antidepressants** via breast milk, with most medications transferring at low levels [^112CTLb6] [^112G4tmg]. Adverse effects are rare but may include sedation, poor feeding, and irritability, particularly with fluoxetine and citalopram [^116kQQAf] [^111SeuKf]. Long-term neurodevelopmental effects remain uncertain due to limited data [^113C5nTw] [^111EWwvE].

---

### Benefits of treating maternal depression during breastfeeding

Benefits include **improved maternal mental health**, reducing the risk of postpartum depression relapse and enhancing maternal functioning [^112ZRJNe] [^112FzG5e]. Effective treatment supports continued breastfeeding, benefiting infant nutrition, immunity, and mother-infant bonding [^114hnucQ] [^115xYhNT].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

- **Individualized risk–benefit assessment**: Consider maternal history, medication profile, and infant factors [^113C5nTw] [^115PZ8bW].
- **Preferred antidepressants**: Sertraline, paroxetine, and nortriptyline are preferred due to low infant exposure and favorable safety profiles [^112CTLb6] [^1119cCpC].
- **Monitor infants**: Watch for sedation, poor feeding, and irritability, especially with fluoxetine and citalopram [^111SeuKf] [^116kQQAf].
- **Coordinate care**: Communicate with the infant's pediatrician for monitoring and follow-up [^113Cy13K] [^111o1S3s].

---

## Practical strategies to minimize infant exposure

- **Timing doses**: Administer medication immediately after breastfeeding or before the infant's longest sleep period [^113Cy13K] [^112G4tmg].
- **Lowest effective dose**: Use the lowest effective dose to minimize infant exposure [^116qzsAo] [^115n8c2x].
- **Monitor infant growth and development**: Regularly assess infant growth and developmental milestones [^113Cy13K] [^111o1S3s].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Breastfeeding can continue while taking antidepressants, but **individualized risk–benefit assessment** is essential [^113C5nTw]. Sertraline, paroxetine, and nortriptyline are preferred due to low infant exposure and favorable safety profiles [^112CTLb6]. Monitor infants for adverse effects, and coordinate care with the pediatrician [^113Cy13K]. Treating maternal depression is critical, as untreated depression poses greater risks to both mother and infant than antidepressant exposure via breast milk [^115PZ8bW].

### Postpartum depression treatment and breastfeeding [^115n8c2x]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2009). Low credibility.

Postpartum depression occurs in about 10% to 20% of childbearing women. When developing a treatment plan, clinicians need to balance the risks of untreated maternal depression, the benefits of breastfeeding, and the risks associated with infant exposure to medication in breast milk. Data on the short-term safety and long-term consequences of antidepressant use during breastfeeding are meager, but several commonly used antidepressants appear to transfer at low levels into breast milk and may or may not be detectable in infant serum. Few adverse events have been reported, and medication discontinuation has been associated with a reversal of those events. Therapeutic doses should be as low as possible, and infants (especially newborns) should be closely monitored for adverse events. Nonpharmacologic treatments should also be considered.

ABM Clinical Protocol #18 — clinical factors affecting antidepressant choice in breastfeeding: Obtain a psychiatric history focused on prior mood/anxiety episodes and effective treatments; if psychotropic medications were used, determine what worked with tolerable side effects, as past treatment response is often the best predictor of future response (II-2). Obtain a family history of psychiatric illness and treatment response, because an immediate family member's history may indicate the mother's treatment response (II-2). Consider the primary symptoms to be targeted and potential side effects, and choose psychotropic medications with an evidence base in lactating women; older medications with available data are preferred over newer antidepressants with limited safety information. An individualized risk–benefit analysis of the treatments must be conducted.

### ABM clinical protocol # 18: use of antidepressants in breastfeeding mothers [^116tK8WY]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

ABM Clinical Protocol #18 — breastfeeding mothers using antidepressants — states that if a mother has previously responded to a specific selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, tricyclic antidepressant, or serotonin–norepinephrine uptake inhibitor, the data for that agent should be reviewed and it should be considered as a first-line treatment if there are no contraindications; mothers treated with these agents during pregnancy with good symptom control should continue on the same agent during breastfeeding, exposure in breastmilk is far less than during pregnancy, and ongoing treatment is critical for the health of both mother and baby. Mothers should be monitored carefully in the initial stages of treatment for changes, women with histories of bipolar disorder are at increased risk of depression, mania, or psychosis in the postpartum period, mothers and partners should be made aware of symptoms including increased insomnia, delusions, hallucinations, racing thoughts, and talking/moving fast, and women experiencing such symptoms should contact their physician immediately; mothers should also receive information on known and unknown risks and benefits to make an informed decision.

ABM Clinical Protocol #18 — antidepressant treatment in lactating women: Current evidence suggests untreated maternal depression can have serious and long-term effects and treatment may improve outcomes; therefore treatment is strongly preferred (II-2). For women with mild symptoms in the first 2 weeks postpartum, close follow-up rather than starting antidepressants is suggested (II-2). When symptoms are mild to moderate, psychological/cognitive behavioral therapy is the first line as it carries no known infant risk; mothers must be monitored and reevaluated, and if not improving or worsening, antidepressant drug treatment should be considered (II-2). If psychological/cognitive behavioral therapy is unavailable, symptoms are severe, or mothers refuse this therapy, antidepressants are an effective option.

### ABM clinical protocol # 18: use of antidepressants in breastfeeding mothers [^115PZ8bW]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Breastfeeding mothers — maternal lactation status should not delay treatment (II-2), and women with moderate to severe symptoms may require only antidepressant drug treatment; in the setting of moderate to severe depression, the benefits of treatment likely outweigh the risks of the medication to the mother or infant. There is no widely accepted algorithm for antidepressant medication treatment of depression in lactating women, and an individualized risk–benefit analysis must be conducted in each situation and take into account the mother's clinical history and response to treatment, the risks of untreated depression, the risks and benefits of breastfeeding, the benefits of treatment, the known and unknown risks of the medication to the infant, and the mother's wishes. If a mother has no history of antidepressant treatment, an antidepressant such as sertraline that has evidence of lower levels in human milk and infant serum and few side effects is an appropriate first choice (II-2), and sertraline has the best safety profile during lactation; the recommended starting dose is 25 mg for 5–7 days to avoid side effects, which then can be increased to 50 mg/day.

ABM Clinical Protocol #18 — choosing an antidepressant during lactation: The medication must be both efficacious for the mother and safe for the infant, and factors affecting the passage of medication into human milk must be considered, including route of drug administration and pharmacokinetics with properties such as pH of plasma (7.4) and milk (6.8), solubility, and protein binding, as well as the amount of drug received by the infant in human milk (milk yield, colostrum versus mature milk, concentration in milk, how well the breast was emptied during the previous feeding, and the infant's ability to absorb, detoxify, and excrete the drug). Most antidepressant studies provide milk levels or milk to mother's plasma ratio that vary with dose, frequency, duration, maternal disposition, interactions, and genetics, whereas few studies provide infant serum levels, although they are the best measure of infant exposure.

Depressed breastfeeding women may have concerns about taking antidepressant medications due to fears regarding infant exposure. We examined the clinical records of 73 breastfeeding women who sought depression treatment, to identify characteristics of those who took antidepressants. Compared to women who were not treated with pharmacotherapy, breastfeeding patients who took antidepressants had more severe symptoms, greater functional impairment, more extensive psychiatric histories, and were less likely to be involved in a committed relationship. No differences were found in age, race, or education.

ABM Clinical Protocol #18 — background and risk factors for postpartum depression (PPD) in breastfeeding mothers report that PPD affects 10–20% of mothers within the first year of childbirth, and studies have found that up to 50% of women with PPD are undiagnosed. Prior history of depression carries approximately 2.5-fold risk of recurrence, and other risk factors include recent stressful life events, lack of social support, unintended pregnancy, and women who are economically stressed, disadvantaged, low income, or black. In socioeconomically disadvantaged families, approximately 25% of women have ongoing depressive symptoms that last well beyond the initial postpartum year. Antidepressant medications are one of the most commonly prescribed pharmacologic treatments of PPD; the mother and her provider should work together to make an individually tailored choice, and the risks of untreated depression, the risks of the medication to the breastfeeding dyad, and the benefits of treatment must be fully considered when making treatment decisions.

### The use of mood stabilizers during breastfeeding [^115svEtZ]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2007). Low credibility.

The literature and majority of professional organizations endorse breastfeeding as a means to provide a number of health benefits to both mother and child. Notably, the postpartum period heralds an increased vulnerability for both new onset and symptom worsening of neuropsychiatric disorders, particularly bipolar disorder in women. While pharmacologic treatment is important for these patients, many physicians have been hesitant to prescribe medication for women who choose to breast-feed, despite the fact that a variety of medical illnesses are routinely treated in breastfeeding women (e.g., epilepsy, infection, allergies, and migraine) and that nursing infants may also directly receive medications for colic and reflux. To date, all psychotropic medications studied enter human breast milk, and many of these medications have undergone detailed investigations. While breastfeeding may complicate pharmacotherapy, it does not preclude it. There are limited scientifically derived guidelines in the treatment of women who choose to breast-feed. The pharmacokinetic properties and potential impact of infant exposure to mood stabilizers must be considered in the decision to breast-feed infants born to mothers receiving pharmacologic treatment for bipolar disorder. Past practices and methodologies for determining continuation of treatment are discussed in this article, as well as the current data for newer categories of drugs being used to treat bipolar disorder and their indications during pregnancy and breastfeeding. Treating pregnant women with neuropsychiatric illnesses in their childbearing years who are breastfeeding involves a thorough risk:benefit analysis to determine the relative safety of pharmacologic therapy. Familiarity with the extant literature and its limitations and practical considerations will enable optimizing treatment plans that maintain maternal mental health, minimize nursing infant exposures, and provide infant monitoring.

Pregnancy and breastfeeding pose a unique challenge to drug development and clinical application. In addition to drug toxicity to the fetus in utero and infants through breastfeeding, alterations of pharmacokinetics in those women also need careful attention. How do we turn around the overall lack of drug efficacy and toxicity information for pregnant and breastfeeding women?

### Medication use during lactation: either a potential contributor to premature weaning or evidence-based support of the mother / child couplet [^116hGsdb]. Clinical Therapeutics (2020). Medium credibility.

It is well established that breastfeeding improves the health of women, children, and populations. According to the 2018 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Report Card, 83% of women initiated breastfeeding, but only 58% maintained breastfeeding at the 6-month mark, and 36% continued to 12 months. Reasons for cessation of breastfeeding are multifactorial and include issues surrounding safe use of medications while breastfeeding for acute or chronic conditions. There are a wide variety of resources that clinicians may consult to help decide if medications are compatible with breastfeeding. The resources have varying data and recommendations, which can make counseling challenging for the clinician. There are some resources that are updated regularly with the most current information about drug safety in lactation, as well as call centers that can answer questions from clinicians and patients. A case scenario is presented to help illustrate the many facets of how medication use can affect breastfeeding. Very few medications are absolutely contraindicated during lactation. Involving the woman and her family in a shared decision-making approach regarding medication use may help women feel more confident in the medication recommendations given and ultimately help women achieve their breastfeeding goals.

Concerns over medication safety

Concerns regarding medication safety and breastfeeding led some women to discount breastfeeding as an option for them.

"… I could try and breastfeed, but yeah, I decided that wasn't — a good idea. Because it's too hard and I wouldn't be able to go back on my medication — right away after the baby was born. You have to wait two months, or something like that. So I thought that was dangerous — for both of us". (34, p383).

Whilst others discontinued breastfeeding due to health concerns for the baby.

"And I had to get my wisdom teeth pulled out, so I decided to stop because they put you on antibiotics and stuff like that. So I just stopped".(26, p5).

Some women with severe mental illness felt that due to the complexities of their mental health, breastfeeding was not considered relevant and was "de-prioritized" for other aspects of acute care. Despite many mothers expressing strong preferences to continue breastfeeding, the mothers often felt that their preferences were ignored.

"Medication was an issue as I was initially given medication that specified it should not be taken while breastfeeding, when I had made my wish to breastfeed very clear". (27, p7).

Some women felt that they needed to prompt staff to consider whether the medication they were prescribed would allow breastfeeding, or, alternatively, be given the choice to cease breastfeeding to allow them to have the most suitable medication to treat their mental health condition.

"I wish they had told me to stop breastfeeding rather than give me diluted medication". (27, p6).

Others described being given contradictory information from health professionals about breastfeeding whilst taking psychotropic medication:

"Early in pregnancy, the mental health midwife said not to take fluoxetine if breastfeeding and to change to sertraline or citalopram. Next time I saw her later on and she said I could stay on fluoxetine if I was happy on it". (27, p6).

Such conflicting advice made mothers confused and distressed. A resultant lack of confidence in healthcare professionals " prompted some women to conduct their own research or to disregard medical advice " (27, p6).

### The evaluation and management of depression in women across the life span [^115AfC5G]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2001). Low credibility.

Depression is more common in women than in men, particularly during the childbearing years. Women may present with different depressive symptoms than men and may respond differently to antidepressant treatment. In addition, depression in women can surface in association with specific points in the reproductive cycle, such as during the premenstrual period, during pregnancy and the postpartum period, and during the perimenopausal years. Antidepressant medications may be used effectively at all stages in a woman's life. In the case of premenstrual dysphoric disorder, serotonergic agents have demonstrated efficacy in both full-cycle and luteal-phase dosing strategies. For depressed women who are pregnant or breastfeeding, the limited safety data available on antidepressants suggest minimal danger to the fetus or infant, and the risks and benefits to both mother and child must be weighed against the risks of untreated illness. Treatment of depression in middle-aged and elderly women should take into account the possible influence of both menopausal status and hormone replacement therapy on antidepressant response. This article will focus on special considerations in the evaluation and management of depression in women across the life span.

### ABM clinical protocol # 18: use of antidepressants in breastfeeding mothers [^113Cy13K]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

ABM Clinical Protocol #18 — infant monitoring and exposure minimization during maternal antidepressant therapy — advises that the mother's provider should communicate with the infant's provider to facilitate monitoring and follow-up, and infants should be monitored carefully by the physician or healthcare worker including growth. The protocol states that serum levels are not indicated or a regular basis without a clinical indication or concern and usually would not be helpful unless the drug is a psychotropic with a documented therapeutic window and laboratory norms such as tricyclic antidepressants. A strategy that may be used to decrease infant exposure based on breastfeeding pharmacokinetic reports is medication administration immediately after feedings (III).

### The safety of duloxetine during pregnancy and lactation [^11393DHk]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2014). Low credibility.

Depression is common in women, especially during pregnancy and the postpartum period. Untreated depression is associated with many adverse gestational outcomes. It is therefore important to know about the safety of different antidepressant drugs during pregnancy and lactation so that informed decisions can be made regarding treatment. This article summarizes published literature on the subject with regard to duloxetine, an antidepressant with serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibition properties. In general, it appears that the use of duloxetine during pregnancy is associated with an increase in the risk of spontaneous abortion, but no increase in other adverse outcomes, such as major fetal malformations. Late-pregnancy exposure to duloxetine may be associated with poor neonatal adaptation syndrome, but the magnitude of this risk is not known. Infant exposure to duloxetine in breast milk is less than 1% of the maternal weight-adjusted dose, suggesting that duloxetine can be safely administered to a woman who is breastfeeding her infant. In general, the very limited data available on the subject do not uncover a signal that the use of duloxetine during pregnancy or lactation increases the risk of adverse outcomes.

### Screening for depression and suicide risk in adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^114zJExA]. JAMA (2023). Excellent credibility.

Adult depression screening — intervals and treatments emphasize limited evidence on timing and pragmatic clinical judgment. The page states there is little evidence on optimal timing in perinatal and general adult populations, that a pragmatic approach might include screening adults not previously screened while using clinical judgment to determine if additional screening is warranted, and that ongoing assessment during pregnancy and the postpartum period is reasonable. For treatment, effective options generally include antidepressant medication or psychotherapy, alone or in combination, and clinicians are encouraged to consider the unique balance of benefits and harms in the perinatal period for pregnant or breastfeeding persons.

The evidence does not support recommending any specific evidence-based psychotherapy over another, and a meta-analysis found fair evidence that CBT and IPT are efficacious for treating postpartum depression; an additional RCT (n = 192) found group treatments were not significantly different from each other although they were not as effective as individual counseling, and an SR of 40 RCTs found fair evidence supporting CBT to treat and prevent depression for women during pregnancy and one year postpartum; there are no studies comparing psychotherapy to medication. Before the initiation of medication in women of childbearing age, providers should discuss whether the individual is sexually active and may be pregnant and the potential risks to the fetus, newborn, and mother of treated and untreated depression, and medication safety should be reviewed again with pregnant or breastfeeding patients who have been prescribed antidepressant medication.

### Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) and International Society for Bipolar Disorders (ISBD) 2018 guidelines for the management of patients with bipolar disorder [^111E4z4F]. Bipolar Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

Patients should be encouraged to initiate or optimize maintenance treatment as soon after giving birth as possible, with preference given to medications that have previously been shown to be successful. Near delivery, close monitoring is essential for early detection and management of symptoms that might signal onset of a mood or psychotic episode. 538 If an acute mood episode emerges in the postpartum period, the hierarchies for non‐postpartum episodes should be followed, but, because most psychotropic medications are excreted in breast milk, treatment choice should take into consideration safety in breastfeeding when applicable.

The FDA website mentioned in the previous section as well as Table 21 also include information on lactation. The FDA PLLR should be consulted for further information about medication risks, as many are secreted in milk, if breastfeeding is being considered.

The potential risks and benefits of taking medications while breastfeeding should be discussed with the patient. Education about early recognition of drug toxicity and requirement for ongoing monitoring of infants is also critical. 539 A recent systematic review suggested quetiapine and olanzapine as preferred choices for breastfeeding, considering their relatively lower infant dosages. 540 The impact of medication on the infant can be reduced by scheduling medication administration after breastfeeding. 541

Replacing or supplementing breast milk with formula can also be considered. Although there are many benefits to breastfeeding, associated sleep disruption may increase the risk of mood episodes in women with BD. If possible, bottle feeding at night by the woman's partner or a support can be beneficial to allow the woman to maintain a better sleeping schedule. In women with postpartum psychosis or mania, breastfeeding may be more risky, and therefore may not be indicated, as the mother may be too disorganized to safely breastfeed. 542

As childbirth can be a trigger for first onset of hypomania/mania in women with MDD, antidepressants should be used cautiously, especially in women with a family history of BD. 543 Women with first onset of depression in the postpartum period or those who have recurrence of depression during the early postpartum period, may also be at a high risk of switching to BD following treatment with antidepressants. 537

### Common questions about the pharmacologic management of depression in adults [^1154GbFB]. American Family Physician (2015). Low credibility.

One in 11 U.S. adults currently meets diagnostic criteria for major depressive disorder, and a similar number report that they have taken an antidepressant medication in the past 30 days. In the primary care population, medications are modestly superior to placebo in achieving remission, with a number needed to treat of seven or eight for selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and seven to 16 for tricyclic antidepressants. The benefit of antidepressants over placebo is more pronounced in patients with severe depression. Second-generation antidepressants are generally considered first-line therapy. Specific therapy choice should be based on cost, patient preference, and adverse effect profile. About two-thirds of patients receiving second-generation antidepressants experience at least one adverse effect during treatment. Nausea and vomiting are the most common reasons for discontinuation of therapy. The optimal treatment duration is unclear, but clinical guidelines suggest four to 12 months for an initial episode of major depression. Patients with recurrent depression may benefit from prolonged treatment. High-quality evidence is lacking on the benefits and harms of antidepressant use in pregnancy. It is unclear whether selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor use in breastfeeding mothers causes adverse effects in their infants, but sertraline and paroxetine transfer to breast milk in lower concentrations than other antidepressants. Consensus guidelines recommend a "start low, go slow" approach to antidepressant therapy in older persons; preferred medications include citalopram, escitalopram, sertraline, mirtazapine, and venlafaxine.

### Medication safety in breastfeeding [^112G4tmg]. American Family Physician (2022). Medium credibility.

Breastfeeding is universally recognized as the preferred method of infant nutrition, but is sometimes abbreviated because of fear of harm to the infant from maternal medication. The amount of medication that enters breast milk varies based on the maternal serum concentration and the pharmacologic properties of the medication. When prescribing medications for a breastfeeding patient, those with the lowest risk to the infant should be selected, and dosing should be before the infant's longest sleep interval. Prescribers should use current, accurate resources. LactMed is a convenient, government-sponsored, authoritative resource that lists safety information for many medications and is available free online. When mental health conditions occur during lactation, priority should be given to effectively treating the mother, often with medications that were effective during pregnancy. Most antidepressants are compatible with breastfeeding. Stimulant medications may decrease milk supply. Insulin, metformin, and second-generation sulfonylureas are generally preferred to treat diabetes mellitus during breastfeeding, but newer agents require caution because they have not been studied in lactation. Inhaled and nasal treatments for asthma and allergic rhinitis are unlikely to affect breastfed infants. Acetaminophen and ibuprofen are preferred analgesics during lactation. Maternal opioid use can cause infant sedation. Herbal supplements are concerning for risk of impurities and lack of study of effects on breastfed infants. Nonhormonal and progestin-only contraceptives are preferred over combination oral contraceptives. Contrast for computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging is not concerning during lactation, but use of radiopharmaceuticals, such as iodine 131, can accumulate in the lactating breast and increase risk to the infant.

### Psychopharmacology in pregnancy and breastfeeding [^111wh8K6]. The Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

The use of psychotropic drugs during pregnancy and breastfeeding remains a controversial topic. There are several reasons for the controversy, ranging from the misperception that pregnancy is protective against mental illness, to the notion that women should be "pure" during pregnancy and avoid all extraneous substance use, and finally, to the stigma and misunderstanding of psychiatric illness and underestimation of how serious it can be. Fortunately, the currently available data are reassuring for most psychiatric medications-properly controlled studies indicate little to no risk for most (but not all) psychiatric medications.

### Antidepressant drugs and breastfeeding: a review of the literature [^1119cCpC]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

The use of antidepressants in breastfeeding mothers is controversial: Manufacters often routinely discourage breastfeeding for the nursing mother despite the well-known positive impact that breastfeeding carries on the health of the nursing infant and on his or her family and society. We conducted a systematic review of drugs commonly used in the treatment of postpartum depression. For every single drug two sets of data were provided: (1) selected pharmacokinetic characteristics such as half-life, milk-to-plasma ratio, protein binding, and oral bioavailability and (2) information about lactational risk, according to some authoritative sources of the literature: Drugs in Pregnancy and Lactation edited by Briggs et al. (Lippincott Williams, Philadelphia, 2008), Medications and Mothers' Milk by Hale (Hale Publishing, Amarillo, TX, 2010), and the LactMed database of TOXNET (www.pubmed.gov; accessed June 2010). Notwithstanding a certain variability of advice, we found that (1) knowledge of pharmacokinetic characteristics are scarcely useful to assess safety and (2) the majority of antidepressants are not usually contraindicated: (a) Selective serotinin reuptake inhibitors and nortryptiline have a better safety profile during lactation, (b) fluoxetine must be used carefully, (c) the tricyclic doxepine and the atypical nefazodone should better be avoided, and (d) lithium, usually considered as contraindicated, has been recently rehabilitated.

ABM Clinical Protocol #18 — spectrum of postpartum mood disorders states that the newer DSM-V expanded the definition of PPD to include onset of symptoms during pregnancy through 4 weeks postpartum. Postpartum blues can affect 30–80% of women, is transient, usually peaks on postpartum Day 5 and resolves by Day 10, and unlike PPD does not adversely affect infant care. Postpartum depression is a major depressive episode, and if left untreated, symptoms may persist beyond 14 days and can last several months to a year.

For immediate postpartum care, the protocol states that "Physician interaction with the breastfeeding dyad in the immediate postpartum period depends on the system of health care and insurance systems within the country", and that "you can collaborate with local hospitals and maternity care professionals within your community, and provide your office policies on breastfeeding initiation within the first hour after birth to delivery rooms and newborn units". An example patient education aid is noted: "You are making milk"; given to Crozer-Chester Medical Center patients after 20 weeks during an anatomy ultrasound".

### Is there consensus across international evidence-based guidelines for the psychotropic drug management of bipolar disorder during the perinatal period? [^1147ndjr]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Clinicians treating a patient with bipolar disorder who is pregnant or breastfeeding may seek advice from bipolar management guidelines that provide recommendations for perinatal treatment. We examine the consistency of such recommendations across several evidence-based guidelines.

Methods

A literature search in the National Guideline Clearinghouse, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, PsycInfo and PubMed was undertaken using the search terms "bipolar disorder" and "guidelines", which generated 11 sets of evidence-based guidelines published by professional organizations during the 2005–2015 period. Information relevant to management during the perinatal period was reviewed by two independent reviewers, with key themes qualitatively analysed.

Results

There was a moderate level of agreement across guidelines regarding the potential teratogenic effects of lithium, sodium valproate and carbamazepine, with most highlighting caution in using these medications during the perinatal period. There was less agreement regarding the safety risks associated with lamotrigine, antipsychotics, and antidepressants, and little agreement regarding the risks and recommendations of medications during breastfeeding.

Limitations

Some differences in recommendations are likely due to varying publication dates, with recent guidelines having more up-to-date evidence available to use when formulating recommendations. Further, due to ethical issues surrounding pregnancy and infant research, the evidence used to formulate perinatal recommendations is largely based on retrospective reports and/or case studies. It is therefore unrealistic to expect such recommendations to be entirely consistent and based on rigorous evidence.

Conclusions

While there was some consistency across guidelines on key recommendations, there were also substantial inconsistencies, with the latter risking compromising clinical management.

### Clinical lactation studies. acting on key recommendations over the last decade [^115qv9Vr]. Npj Women's Health (2025). Medium credibility.

To date, relatively few clinical lactation studies are conducted during drug development and are generally performed as a post-marketing requirement or commitment (PMR or PMC), potentially because a sufficient amount of safety data at the therapeutically beneficial dose has been gathered by the time of approval or post-approval. One review of approval letters of original New Drug Applications to the FDA between 2000 and 2022 report that only 18 included a lactation study as a PMR, 89% of which were requested after 2017. Another review of US product labelling for 422 new molecular entities approved by the FDA between 2001 and 2020 found that only 23 (5%) included human lactation data.

Systematic reviews of antiretrovirals, drugs used to treat neglected tropical diseases, tuberculosis and malaria, antihypertensivesand antidepressants, in lactating mothers report significant limitations in study design and quality. While there have been attempts to harmonise the approach to studying drugs in breastfeeding women since 2002, there remains a clear need for key stakeholders to create a coordinated approach towards understanding the challenges involved and creating collaborative opportunities for future research in lactation. Furthermore, operational and methodological issues relating to the conduct of lactation studies remain an issue and require further consideration and discussion. Establishing clear consensus is timely given the recent US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) diversity action plan (DAP) draft guidance (July, 2024) that aims to improve enrolment of participants from underrepresented populations, including pregnancy and lactation, in clinical studies.

To allow appropriate inclusion of breastfeeding women will require knowledge of drug disposition during lactation through pragmatic and feasible clinical trials. Guidance from the FDA released in 2005 and updated in 2019 recommends the conduct of lactation studies when 'a drug under review for approval is expected to be used by women of reproductive age'.

Over the past few years, there have been an increasing number of publications making the case for the inclusion of pregnant and breastfeeding women in clinical trials –. Frequently, statements on 'pregnancy and lactation' group these together and give more emphasis to pregnancy, despite the fact that there are unique challenges to conducting trials in each WOCBP subpopulation. This article aims to redress the balance with a commentary on the current status of lactation trials and recommendations to improve inclusion.

### Antidepressants during pregnancy and lactation: defining exposure and treatment issues [^1156M7ES]. Seminars in Perinatology (2001). Low credibility.

The majority of psychiatric illness onsets early in an individual's life, typically before or during the reproductive years. The increased incidence of major depression, dysthymia, and panic disorder in women compared with men underscores the likelihood that the clinician will encounter the clinical dilemma of medication use during pregnancy and lactation. The emergence of specialized clinics at several academic centers specifically to investigate and address issues in Perinatal psychiatry illustrates this conundrum best. The extant literature derived from human studies suggests that maternal mental illness and stress may have an adverse impact on obstetrical outcome. These clinical investigations are complemented by a burgeoning series of laboratory studies in rodents and nonhuman primates, showing the profound deleterious impact of maternal stress during the perinatal and neonatal periods on the development of the offspring. Data obtained from pharmaceutical registries, cohort studies, toxicology centers, and case series have consistently failed to show an adverse effect associated with in utero antidepressant exposure. Despite these advances and treatment guidelines proposed by the various academic leaders, investigations describing the extent of fetal/neonatal exposure, clinical methods for minimizing such exposure, and clinical treatment guidelines that include the physiological impact of pregnancy are sparse. The available literature shows distinct pharmacokinetic profiles of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in placental passage and breast milk. Preliminary animal studies have shown higher than expected central nervous system concentrations associated with exposure during pregnancy and mathematical modelling for calculating infant exposure when nursing. The clinical import of these data will require further investigations of central nervous system bioavailability in the fetus and neonate.

### Antidepressants for preventing postnatal depression [^111B3YXY]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Depression is common in the postnatal period and can lead to adverse effects on the infant and wider family, in addition to the morbidity for the mother. It is not clear whether antidepressants are effective for the prevention of postnatal depression and little is known about possible adverse effects for the mother and infant, particularly during breastfeeding. This is an update of a Cochrane Review last published in 2005.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of antidepressant medication for the prevention of postnatal depression, in comparison with any other treatment, placebo or standard care.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Controlled Trials Register (CCMDCTR ‒ both Studies and References), CENTRAL (Wiley), MEDLINE (OVID), Embase (OVID), PsycINFO (OVID), on 13 February 2018. We also searched the World Health Organization (WHO) trials portal (ICTRP) and ClinicalTrials.gov on 13 February 2018 to identify any additional unpublished or ongoing studies.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of initiation of antidepressants (alone or in combination with another treatment), compared with any other treatment, placebo or standard care for the prevention of postnatal depression among women who were either pregnant or had given birth in the previous six weeks and were not currently depressed at baseline.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. We requested missing information from investigators wherever possible and sought data to allow intention-to-treat analyses.

Main Results

Two trials including a total of 81 participants fulfilled the inclusion criteria for this review. All participants in both studies had a history of postnatal depression and were not taking antidepressant medication at baseline. Both trials were conducted by the same research group. Risk of bias was low or unclear in most domains for both studies. We were unable to perform a meta-analysis due to the small number of studies. One study compared nortriptyline with placebo and did not find any evidence that nortriptyline was effective in preventing postnatal depression. In this study, 23% (6/26) of women who took nortriptyline and 24% (6/25) of women who took placebo experienced postnatal depression (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.36 to 2.59, very low quality evidence) in the first 17 weeks postpartum. One woman taking nortriptyline developed mania; and one side effect, constipation, was more common among women taking nortriptyline than those taking placebo. The second study compared sertraline with placebo. In this study, 7% (1/14) of women who took sertraline developed postnatal depression in the first 17 weeks postpartum compared with 50% (4/8) of women who took placebo. It is uncertain whether sertraline reduces the risk of postnatal depression (RR 0.14, 95% CI 0.02 to 1.07, very low quality evidence). One woman taking sertraline had a hypomanic episode. Two side effects (dizziness and drowsiness) were more common among women taking sertraline than women taking placebo. Conclusions are limited by the small number of studies, small sample sizes and incomplete outcome data due to study drop-out which may have led to bias in the results. We have assessed the certainty of the evidence as very low, based on the GRADE system. No data were available on secondary outcomes of interest including child development, the mother‒infant relationship, breastfeeding, maternal daily functioning, family relationships or maternal satisfaction.

Authors' Conclusions

Due to the limitations of the current evidence base, such as the low statistical power of the included studies, it is not possible to draw any clear conclusions about the effectiveness of antidepressants for the prevention of postnatal depression. It is striking that no new eligible trials have been completed in the period of over a decade since the last published version of this review. Larger trials are needed which include comparisons of antidepressant drugs with other prophylactic treatments (e.g. psychological interventions), and examine adverse effects for the fetus or infant. Future reviews in this area may benefit from broadening their focus to examine the effectiveness of antidepressants for the prevention of perinatal (i.e. antenatal or postnatal) depression, which could include studies comparing antidepressant discontinuation with continuation for the prevention of relapse of depression during pregnancy and the postnatal period.

### Acceptability of a randomized trial of anti-depressant medication or interpersonal therapy for treatment of perinatal depression in women with HIV [^1133EmTG]. AIDS and Behavior (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Despite being the primary contributor to global disability, depression (and mental health in general) is not yet a policy or funding priority in the Global South. Postpartum mood disorders, beginning during pregnancy or the first month after delivery, have been under-recognized and under-treated but are increasingly recognized as a major health issue. Postpartum depression (PPD) is thought to affect as many as one in five postpartum women in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) and can have devastating consequences for both mother and child, especially when co-occurring with maternal HIV. Depression can severely reduce a woman's ability to keep medical appointments or adhere to prescribed medications. It also reduces the length and quality of breastfeeding and can interfere with maternal-infant bonding. While there is no worldwide shortage of new public health interventions being tested for mothers and children, mental health interventions have been left frustratingly behind.

Depression and anxiety have been treated with various forms of psychotherapy, medication, or a combination of both treatment modalities. In the few clinical trials that exist, neither treatment seems to show clear benefit over the others. There are potential benefits and limitations for each type of treatment, particularly in places such as SSA where resources are limited and HIV seroprevalence is high. Among women with HIV on antiretroviral therapy (ART), adding an antidepressant medication may reduce medication adherence because of increased pill burden. Behavioral and psychosocial interventions, such as cognitive behavioral therapy with integrated adherence counseling, can mitigate this risk and have demonstrated increased medication adherence in randomized trials among adults with both HIV infection and depression. A potential barrier to psychosocial interventions is the availability of mental health providers in countries with medical staff shortages. However, task-shifting models of depression treatment show great promise in equipping primary care and mid-level providers with the training and supervision to safely and effectively manage depression in these settings.

### From inception to concePTION: genesis of a network to support better monitoring and communication of medication safety during pregnancy and breastfeeding [^116uNfvq]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2022). Medium credibility.

More than 200 million women worldwide become pregnant every year, and a majority take at least one medication during pregnancy. However, merely 5% of available medications have been adequately monitored, tested, and labeled with safety information for use in pregnant or breastfeeding women. Pregnant and breastfeeding women have long been overlooked in medical research, especially in randomized controlled clinical trials, due to complex practical, ethical, and legal challenges. Since the 2000s, data generated in routine healthcare have been increasingly used and recognized as a valuable source for evidence generation, offering the possibility of filling evidence gaps left by randomized controlled clinical trials and rendering the lack of information on pregnancy and breastfeeding even more untenable from ethical, medical, and societal perspectives. In 2019, the Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI) funded the ConcePTION project — Building an ecosystem for better monitoring and communicating safety of medicines use in pregnancy and breastfeeding: validated and regulatory endorsed workflows for fast, optimised evidence generation — with the vision that there is a societal obligation to rapidly reduce uncertainty about the safety of medication use in pregnancy and breastfeeding. ConcePTION aims to contribute to filling the knowledge gap regarding the effects of medicines in pregnancy and lactation, by developing a system across European Data Access Providers (DAPs) that transforms existing and routinely collected healthcare data into evidence in a robust and transparent manner.

### Citalopram hydrobromide (Celexa) [^116kQQAf]. FDA (2010). Low credibility.

When treating a pregnant woman with Celexa during the third trimester, the
physician should carefully consider both the potential risks and benefits of
treatment (see DOSAGE AND
ADMINISTRATION). Physicians should note that in a prospective
longitudinal study of 201 women with a history of major depression who were
euthymic at the beginning of pregnancy, women who discontinued antidepressant
medication during pregnancy were more likely to experience a relapse of major
depression than women who continued antidepressant medication.

Labor and Delivery

The effect of Celexa on labor and delivery in humans is
unknown.

Nursing Mothers

As has been found to occur with many other drugs, citalopram is
excreted in human breast milk. There have been two reports of infants
experiencing excessive somnolence, decreased feeding, and weight loss in
association with breastfeeding from a citalopram-treated mother; in one case,
the infant was reported to recover completely upon discontinuation of citalopram
by its mother and in the second case, no follow-up information was available.
The decision whether to continue or discontinue either nursing or Celexa therapy
should take into account the risks of citalopram exposure for the infant and the
benefits of Celexa treatment for the mother.

Pediatric Use

Safety and effectiveness in the pediatric population have not
been established (see BOX WARNING and WARNINGS — Clinical Worsening and Suicide Risk). Two
placebo-controlled trials in 407 pediatric patients with MDD have been conducted
with Celexa, and the data were not sufficient to support a claim for use in
pediatric patients. Anyone considering the use of Celexa in a child or
adolescent must balance the potential risks with the clinical need.

### Clinical lactation studies. acting on key recommendations over the last decade [^116CZLTk]. Npj Women's Health (2025). Medium credibility.

The main reasons for such exclusion largely relate to concerns about clinical trials in pregnancy and the resultant fetal drug exposure. Similarly, ethical issues around inclusion of breastfeeding females are linked to the potential safety risk to the infant without providing any direct benefits. Infant exposure through breast milk is typically lower than that which occurs through placental transfer during pregnancy, although important exceptions do exist. For example, bedaquiline concentrations were about 14-fold higher in breast milk relative to maternal plasma, in mothers treated for rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis; a breastfed infant whose mother was treated with this regimen reached similar plasma concentrations to the mother. In clinical trials, expectedness is used to determine whether a reaction is an expected side effect of a drug or treatment. Case reports suggest that adverse drug reactions in breastfeeding infants are uncommon, but a clinical challenge is that non-specific symptoms (such as crying, irritability, etc) are relatively common in infants aged under 1 month; it can be difficult to determine whether any of these symptoms relate to drug exposure. Established pharmacovigilance systems enable reporting of potential transmammary adverse drug reactions, although rates of spontaneous reporting are low, and there is a bias towards more severe events such as respiratory depression. Opioids and antidepressants or other central nervous system acting agents are most widely implicated, however there is paucity of knowledge on other drug classes, and it can be particularly challenging to investigate risk of subtle, long-term consequences.

Medication use during breastfeeding — prescribing guidance emphasizes to "Be aware of breastfeeding safety before prescribing medication, and when appropriate, consider alternative medications with more evidence to support safety in breastfeeding". It directs that "The risk–benefit ratio should be weighed against the risks of not breastfeeding" when initiating or modifying treatment and that this discussion "should be not only be encouraged but deemed necessary". Clinicians are told to "Keep a list of resources to aid you in this including knowledgeable pediatricians, family physicians, OBs/GYNs, pharmacists, and reputable websites addressing breastfeeding and medication use that is, LactMed, E-lactancia, Embryotox, and your county's specific website addressing this topic", and to "Dispel breastfeeding myths regarding the use of certain medications (i.e., antidepressants, antibiotics, and opioids)".

ABM Clinical Protocol #18 — specific antidepressants and infant exposure during breastfeeding: A meta-analysis indicated all antidepressants were detected in milk but not all were found in infant serum. Infant serum levels of nortriptyline, paroxetine, and sertraline were undetectable in most cases, whereas citalopram and fluoxetine exceeded the recommended 10% maternal level in 17% and 22% of cases, respectively. Conclusions could not be drawn for other antidepressants due to an insufficient number of cases. There is little or no evidence that ethnic or regional "medicines" are safe or effective; thus their use by healthcare providers is strongly cautioned (II-2).

### The use of psychotropic medications during breast-feeding [^111o1S3s]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

The authors reviewed the risks and benefits regarding the use of psychiatric medications during breast-feeding as they relate to the health and well-being of mothers and their infants. Strategies are discussed to limit infant exposure to a medication while effectively treating the nursing mother.

Method

A MEDLINE search of the literature since 1955 was conducted to determine the use of psychotropic medications in breast-feeding women. Search items included each of the categories of psychopharmacologic agents as well as each of the agents in association with nursing, breast-feeding, postpartum, lactation, and breast milk.

Results

No controlled studies on the safety of psychotropic medications in nursing mothers were found. Case reports and small case series for each of the different psychotropic medications serve as the basis for suggested treatment guidelines for the management of psychiatric illnesses in breast-feeding women. Thus, each case needs to be considered on an individual basis, with a thoughtful analysis of the risks and benefits of nursing and exposure of the infant to medication. The baseline clinical status of the infant should also be reviewed.

Conclusions

Women are vulnerable postpartum to psychiatric disorders and frequently face the need to decide whether to take psychotropic medications while breast-feeding. Should psychiatric medication be indicated, the parents should be provided with the available information regarding the effects of these medications on the neonate. In this way, an informed decision can be made. When psychotropic medication is used during breast-feeding, it is strongly recommended that the infant's pediatrician be involved in monitoring the infant.

### Improving safe and effective use of drugs in pregnancy and lactation: workshop summary [^116ZV76J]. American Journal of Perinatology (2017). Low credibility.

Although a large number of pregnant and lactating women receive prescription drugs, over-the-counter (OTC) medications, and supplements, many knowledge gaps persist concerning the safety and efficacy of these therapies. Consequently, there is wide variability in the advice women receive concerning medication use during pregnancy and lactation. To address this, the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine (SMFM), the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) convened a group of experts to a workshop to review the "current" state of the clinical care and science regarding medication use during the perinatal period. These groups were also charged with suggesting guidance for practitioners as well as identification of research gaps. This manuscript provides a summary of the opinions provided by the expert panel.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports that the diagnosis of prepregnancy chronic health conditions are on the rise in the United States. These conditions include cardiovascular disease, metabolic disorders, mental health disorders, and respiratory diseases. These trends could be the result of improved modalities for diagnosing and treatments. Because most interventions to manage these conditions employ the use of pharmacologic products that have not been well studied in pregnant and lactating women, the true risks and benefits of such interventions remain speculative. Furthermore, Mitchell et al performed a retrospective study of more than 19,000 women from two case control studies that enrolled patients from 1976 to 2008, and reported that approximately 90% of women were taking at least one medication, either prescription or OTC, during their pregnancy. About 7 in 10 women were taking one or more prescription medications during their pregnancy with almost one-third of women using four medications. In addition, medication use in the first trimester increased by 62.5% over the study period. The most dramatic increase in prescription medication seen in this study was women who were exposed to antidepressants from 1988 to 1990 (< 1%) and the striking increase and peak at 7.5% during the study period of 2003 to 2008. According to Werler et al, two case-control studies demonstrated that acetaminophen was used at least 65% of the time, whereas ibuprofen and pseudoephedrine exposure during pregnancy occurred in approximately one in six women. There have been very few studies examining the risks of pregnancy and fetal outcomes after exposure to OTC medications as well as prescription drugs.

### The treatment of postpartum depression: minimizing infant exposures [^113soTqG]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2002). Low credibility.

The first 3 postpartum months represent a high-risk period for psychiatric illnesses. This article reviews the prevalence and diagnostic criteria for postpartum illnesses, including the "maternal blues", postpartum depression, and postpartum psychosis. Pharmacologic treatment of these disorders is often complicated by a patient's desire to breast-feed, yet there are no controlled trials of antidepressant treatment during lactation. Infant exposure and limitations to monitoring infant sera are reviewed. Lastly, a model and guide for reducing fetal and infant exposures is presented.

### Pharmacotherapy for depression and bipolar disorder during lactation: a framework to aid decision making [^115xYhNT]. Seminars in Perinatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

Breastmilk is recommended as the exclusive source of nutrition for infants younger than 6 months due to the numerous health benefits for both infants and mothers. Although many women are prescribed medications during pregnancy and postpartum, limited data are available to assist women in weighing the benefits compared to the risks of peripartum medication use. The goals of this paper are to discuss the importance of breastmilk for the health of both the mother and infant, evaluate the impact of medication use on women's infant feeding choice, describe the transfer of drugs to breastmilk and infants, and provide a framework for clinicians to support evidence-based counseling for women treated for mood disorders.

Recommendations

We recommend early pregnancy counseling to discuss the benefits and risks of medications during breastfeeding. The Surgeon General's Call to Action (2011) highlights the short and long-term negative health effects of not providing breastmilk. Integrating recommendations from the pediatric and obstetric teams allows patients to make decisions based on evidence and reach their infant feeding goals. Databases containing summaries of research findings and pharmacologic properties of the drug of interest are an essential resource for clinicians.

Decisions about the use of psychotropic medication in pregnancy are an ongoing challenge for clinicians and women with mental health problems, owing to the uncertainties around risks of the illness itself to mother and fetus/infant, effectiveness of medications in pregnancy and risks to the fetus/infant from in utero exposure or via breast milk. These consensus guidelines aim to provide pragmatic advice regarding these issues. They are divided into sections on risks of untreated illness in pregnancy; general principles of using drugs in the perinatal period; benefits and harms associated with individual drugs; and recommendations for the management of specific disorders.

Despite the fact that childbirth is often a time of joy for a family, the occurrence of perinatal depression is very common. It is essential for the depressed patient to be identified and treated during the pregnancy or postpartum because the failure to treat can have significant morbidity and even mortality for the woman and the child. Despite various concerns several antidepressant medications are generally safe and, after a careful risk/benefit analysis and informed consent, indicated for the severely depressed pregnant or lactating patient.

### Update and critique of natural remedies as antidepressant treatments [^111tNR6J]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

The popularity of natural or "alternative" remedies to treat medical and psychiatric disorders has accelerated dramatically over the past decade, in the United States and worldwide. This article reviews the evidence for clinical efficacy, active ingredients, mechanisms of action, recommended dosages, and toxicities of the 3 best-studied putative natural antidepressants, St. John's wort (hypericum), S-adenosyl methionine, and the Omega-3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid. Despite growing evidence for efficacy and safety, more comprehensive studies are required before these remedies can be recommended as safe and effective alternatives or adjuncts to conventional psychotropic agents. There are limited data regarding safety in pregnancy and during lactation, and caution is therefore recommended in women who are pregnant or breastfeeding.

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)

NICE guidance and a systematic review described SSRI use to treat depression in pregnancy. The SSRIs are used to treat chronic pain at similar doses used to treat depression. A systematic review considered data from > 50 000 infants exposed to SSRIs in utero, which did not show an overall increased risk for congenital malformations. It describes ongoing debate about the risk for cardiovascular malformations with first-trimester use of SSRIs with risk found from some but not all studies. Overall, any increase in absolute risk was thought unlikely to be clinically significant and may be associated with particular SSRIs, principally fluoxetine and paroxetine.

The UKTIS summary of findings to date from studies on SSRIs states that a causal association between use of SSRIs in pregnancy and any type of congenital malformation has not been confirmed. It also describes conflicting results from other outcomes and concludes that available data do not suggest that SSRI use in pregnancy increases the risk of stillbirth and that possible associations with neurodevelopmental impairment in infants requires further study. An increased risk, however, of persistent pulmonary hypertension (PPHN) of the newborn has also been reported following exposure to SSRIs as a class beyond 20 weeks of gestation and, although it remains an uncommon event (0.2–1.2% vs 0.1–0.2% in the background population), it represents a potentially serious neonatal complication. Because there is no robust evidence of a superior safety profile for any one drug, switching between drugs is not recommended if depression is stable on treatment.

NICE recommendations on use of TCAs, SSRIs or SNRIs include consideration of: the uncertainty about whether any increased risk to the foetus and other problems for the woman or baby can be attributed directly to these drugs or may be caused by other factors; and the risk of discontinuation symptoms in the woman and neonatal adaptation syndrome in the baby with most TCAs, SSRIs and (S)NRIs, in particular paroxetine and venlafaxine.

There is limited information on the use of these drugs in breastfeeding. One small study showed temporarily reduced growth during exposure to fluoxetine in breastmilk. There have been no studies specifically investigating compatibility of paroxetine and sertraline with breastfeeding, but sertraline is reported as having one of the lowest rates of transmission to breastmilk. The following recommendations were based on evidence as shown in Supplementary Table S4, available at Rheumatology online.

PHARMACOLOGIC INTERVENTIONS

The ACOG recommends that treatment for perinatal depression be accessible to all patients. Untreated prenatal depression may lead to suicidal ideation, poor nutrition, weight loss, poor self‐care, cognitive impairment, and disengagement from prenatal care; however, various interventions need to be considered in the context of effects on the mother–infant dyad. It is unclear if antidepressants, a mainstay of treatment during pregnancy, are associated with preterm birth and possible teratogenicity. If considering pharmacologic treatment, the choice of medication should be based on whether the efficacy is known, the safety in pregnancy and during breastfeeding, and consideration of drug interactions.

SSRIs are considered first‐line agents commonly used in pregnancy and postpartum.SSRIs have not been associated with congenital anomalies in large studies. Serotonin‐norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors may be considered for patients who are unresponsive to SSRIs. For patients who have been treated effectively with an antidepressant in the past, that medication should generally be the drug of choice during pregnancy. Antidepressants should be used at the lowest effective dose and as a single agent if possible.

Currently, there are 2 Food and Drug Administration–approved medications for new‐onset moderate to severe depression, with onset in the third trimester or within 4 weeks postpartum. Brexanolone is a neurosteroid that acts on gamma‐aminobutyric acid type A (GABA‐A) receptors and is administered as an IV infusion over 60 hours, and zuranolone is an oral formulation dosed at 50 mg/d for 14 days. Tricyclic antidepressants may be used in patients who are refractory to other medications listed above. This group of medications has low teratogenic potential and low excretion in breast milk, except for clomipramine; however, use is limited to select cases due to side effects of orthostatic hypotension and anticholinergic properties. Benzodiazepines should be avoided in pregnancy. An overview of the commonly used medications is shown in Table 2.

Table 2
Pharmacologic Therapy for Depression and Anxiety in Pregnancy and Postpartum

More recent data demonstrate that psychological interventions can prevent postpartum depression in high‐risk patients. The ACOG recommends that pharmacotherapy for postpartum depression not be withheld or discontinued in pregnant and lactating people alone. The ACOG recommends that SSRIs be considered as first‐line pharmacotherapy and that brexanolone administration be considered for moderate to severe postpartum depression.

### Postpartum psychosis: a proposed treatment algorithm [^113spB2W]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). Medium credibility.

Breastfeeding

The risks and benefits to the mother–infant dyad have to be considered when breastfeeding recommendations are made in PPP. Although breastfeeding is recommended where possible, we argue that in PPP, the risks of breastfeeding to the mother–infant dyad may often outweigh the benefits. Sleep deprivation is common in breastfeeding women and can lead to deterioration of symptoms in PPP. The choice of medications that may be used to treat PPP is limited in breastfeeding (e.g. lithium, with the best evidence base for treatment of PPP, is a relative contraindication to breastfeeding in many healthcare systems). Please see section 'Lithium and other mood stabilisers' for further discussion of lithium and breastfeeding), with additional constraints on doses of medications that may be used. The resulting inadequate treatment of PPP combined with the perpetuating effect of sleep deprivation can prolong the episode of PPP, further impacting the mother–infant dyad.

We acknowledge that in certain situations, such as low- and middle-income countries, formula feeding may not be feasible due to the costs of infant formula and hygiene concerns with bottles. Breast milk is vital for the development of preterm infants and the use of a breast milk bank where available might be considered in this circumstance. Occasionally, when the prescribed medication is safe in breastfeeding, daytime breastfeeding may be supplemented by nocturnal formula feeds offered by the partner or carer to facilitate maternal sleep. Reference to the latest guidance on medications in breastfeeding is recommended before prescribing. There is limited long-term safety data for psychotropic medication in breastfeeding. Information on the levels of individual drugs in breast milk and infant blood and the possible adverse effects in the breastfeeding infant may be found, in databases such as the Drugs and Lactation Database (LactMed).

### Frequency of infant adverse events that are associated with citalopram use during breast-feeding [^11664jXY]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to determine the frequency of infantile adverse events from exposure through breast-feeding to maternal citalopram therapy.

Study Design

This was a prospective, observational cohort study. Women who were breast-feeding were placed in three groups on the basis of citalopram use: group 1 consisted of 31 women who were depressed and were undergoing citalopram therapy, group 2 consisted of 12 women who were depressed but were not undergoing citalopram therapy, and group 3 consisted of 31 healthy women who were matched to group 1 by maternal age and parity. Data collection included infant feeding method, medication use, and adverse events.

Results

There was no statistically significant difference in the rate of adverse events in the three groups (3/31 events, 0/12 events, and 1/31 events in groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively). The average dose of citalopram that was used in group 1 was 25.3 ± 11.4 mg per day (range, 10–60 mg/d).

Conclusion

To our knowledge, this is the first prospective, controlled study to examine the safety of citalopram during breast-feeding, which should be continued during maternal citalopram therapy.

### Depression during pregnancy and postpartum [^112knczp]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2016). Low credibility.

Depression is a common complication of pregnancy and the postpartum period. There are multiple risk factors for peripartum mood disorders, most important of which is a prior history of depression. Both depression and antidepressant medications confer risk upon the infant. Maternal depression has been associated with preterm birth, low birth weight, fetal growth restriction, and postnatal cognitive and emotional complications. Antidepressant exposure has been associated with preterm birth, reductions in birth weight, persistent pulmonary hypertension, and postnatal adaptation syndrome (PNAS) as well as a possible connection with autism spectrum disorder. Paroxetine has been associated with cardiac malformations. Most antidepressant medications are excreted in low levels in breast milk and are generally compatible with breastfeeding. The use of antidepressants during pregnancy and postpartum must be weighed against the risk of untreated depression in the mother.

### Adverse drug reactions in breastfed infants: less than imagined [^114C7YVs]. Clinical Pediatrics (2003). Low credibility.

Medication use during breastfeeding shortens the duration of breastfeeding often because of overly cautious information given by healthcare providers. No comprehensive review of the literature on infant adverse reactions from drugs in breastmilk has been published. All published studies and case reports on adverse events in infants caused by medications (excluding drugs of abuse) in breastmilk were identified and analyzed. Of 100 case reports evaluated, none were considered to be "definite" using a standard ranking scale; 47% were "probable" and 53% were "possible". Drugs with central nervous system activity accounted for half of all reports. All 3 reported fatalities involved central nervous system depressants, but each had extenuating circumstances. At least 63% of reported cases were in neonates and 78% were in infants 2 months or younger; only 4% of adverse reactions occurred in infants older than 6 months of age. Published studies expand on and generally reinforce the analysis of case reports. By taking a few simple precautions in drug selection and considering the infant's age, breastfeeding rarely needs to be discouraged or discontinued when a mother needs drug therapy.

### Serum fluvoxamine levels in breastfed infants [^114RstJ4]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Between 10% and 15% of new mothers will experience an episode of postpartum depression. Although antidepressants are effective agents for the treatment of postpartum depression, minimal data are available to support their safety in infants of breastfeeding mothers.

Method

In this article, we present 2 cases of nursing mother-infant pairs in which the mother was treated with fluvoxamine and in which infant serum fluvoxamine levels were obtained. Both mothers began the fluvoxamine treatment postpartum, and serum levels were obtained from mothers and infants after a minimum of 7 days on a stable maternal dose. One level was obtained from the infant in case 1, and 2 levels were obtained from the infant in case 2.

Results

Each of the infant serum fluvoxamine levels obtained was too low to quantify (at a limit of detection of 2.5 ng/mL). Neither of the infants experienced adverse events related to the mother's treatment with fluvoxamine. Each of the infants is reportedly healthy 2 to 3 years after the exposure.

Conclusion

While these results are encouraging, they are limited and cannot be generalized to all cases of infants exposed to fluvoxamine. Additional mother-infant serum fluvoxamine levels and infant behavioral observations will facilitate the risk-benefit decision-making process for women who choose to breast-feed while taking fluvoxamine.

### Postpartum depression: a role for psychedelics? [^117SrVMn]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2022). Medium credibility.

The favourable safety profile of psilocybin, when administered in a therapeutic setting, is becoming evident in healthy participants and those with MDD. However, there is little research on the safety of psilocybin or other psychedelics in the perinatal period. Although the teratogenic potential of classic psychedelics appears low from observational studies, in the absence of clinical trials of teratogenicity and in common with almost all other clinical drug trials, trials with classic psychedelics continue to exclude women who are pregnant, intending to become pregnant, or breastfeeding from participating.

There is no research into the safety of psilocybin in breastfeeding women, largely due to ethical concerns. However, in recent years, there has been a shift from systematic exclusion of breastfeeding women from clinical drug trials towards a more reasoned approach of inclusion while taking infant safety into consideration. The Council of International Organisations of Medical Sciences International Ethical Guideline for Health-related Research Involving Humans now promotes research designed to obtain knowledge relevant to the health needs of breastfeeding women, initiated after consideration of the best available data. The latest International Council of Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice draft guideline gives consideration to the inclusion of breastfeeding women in clinical trials, highlighting that excretion of the investigational drug or its metabolites into breastmilk should be examined where applicable and feasible, with infants monitored for the effects of the drug. Phase 2 trials continue to demonstrate the safety of psilocybin in the general population, and bearing in mind the potential benefit of psilocybin therapy on maternal wellbeing and the mother–infant relationship, there is a case for examining safety and feasibility of psilocybin in breastfeeding women. This would allow for broader inclusion of breastfeeding women in future psychedelic trials.

We propose that psilocybin may have a role in the treatment of PPD, particularly in engendering 'reconnection' of the mother to herself, her infant, and her support structures, and promoting positive enduring changes in the mother–infant relationship. We propose a pilot study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of psilocybin in the treatment of PPD. The increasing evidence base for safety of psilocybin in both healthy adults and those with MDD lays the foundation for pilot studies of psilocybin in the treatment of PPD, with appropriate precautionary and safety measures in place.

### Psychotropic drug use during breastfeeding: a review of the evidence [^111EWwvE]. Pediatrics (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective of this study was to review the existing literature on the use of various classes of psychotropic medications during breastfeeding to provide information about infant exposure levels and reported adverse events in breastfed infants.

Methods

A bibliographic search in the Medline (1967 through July 2008), Embase (1975 through July 2008), and PsycINFO (1967 through July 2008) databases was conducted for studies on breastfeeding and psychotropic medications for a total of 96 drugs. References of retrieved articles, reference books, and dedicated Web sites were also checked. The manufacturers were contacted for drugs without published information. Original articles and review articles that provide pharmacokinetic data on drug excretion in breast milk and infant safety data were considered, to estimate the "compatibility level" of each drug with breastfeeding.

Results

A total of 183 original articles were eligible for analysis. Documentation was retrieved for 62 (65%) drugs. In all, 19 (31%) psychotropic drugs can be used during lactation according to an evidence-based approach. For 28 drugs, the available data do not permit an evaluation of the drug's safety profile during breastfeeding and, for an additional 15 drugs, the exposure dose or observed adverse effects make their use unsafe.

Conclusions

Although most drugs are considered safe during breastfeeding, compatibility with breastfeeding has not been established for all psychotropic drugs. There is a need for additional research and accumulation of experience to guarantee a more rational use of psychotropic drugs during breastfeeding.

### Use of duloxetine in pregnancy and lactation [^116bTWCi]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

To report a case of a woman who used duloxetine during pregnancy and breast-feeding.

Case Summary

A 29-year-old woman was treated with duloxetine for depression during the second half of an uncomplicated gestation. She gave birth at term to a healthy female infant. A cord blood sample was obtained at birth. The mother continued the antidepressant while exclusively breast-feeding her infant. One month later, we collected blood and milk samples from the mother and a single blood sample from the infant. All samples were analyzed for the presence and concentrations of duloxetine.

Discussion

Duloxetine crosses the placenta at term and is excreted into breast milk. No evidence of developmental or other type of toxicity was observed in the infant at birth or during the first 32 days after birth. The published literature detailing human pregnancy experience with this antidepressant is limited to 11 cases in which women became pregnant while taking duloxetine. In 10 cases, the drug was discontinued when pregnancy was diagnosed and no outcome data were reported. In the eleventh case, an infant exposed to duloxetine 90 mg/day developed neonatal behavioral syndrome. One study examined the excretion of duloxetine into breast milk, but the mothers discontinued nursing for the study. In the present case, no adverse effects from exposure to the drug in milk were noted in the exclusively breast-fed infant. The possibility of functional/neurobehavioral deficits appearing later in life cannot be excluded because long-term follow-up has not been conducted in infants exposed to duloxetine in utero or during nursing.

Conclusions

No developmental toxicity or other signs of toxicity were observed in an infant exposed to duloxetine during the second half of gestation and during breast-feeding in the first 32 days after birth. However, the possibility of functional/neurobehavioral deficits appearing later in life cannot be excluded.

### Desvenlafaxine succinate (desvenlafaxine) [^112XXzPZ]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

8.2 Lactation

Risk Summary

Available limited data from published literature show low levels of desvenlafaxine in human milk, and have not shown adverse reactions in breastfed infants (see Data). There are no data on the effects of desvenlafaxine on milk production.

The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for desvenlafaxine and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from desvenlafaxine or from the underlying maternal condition.

Data

A lactation study was conducted in 10 breastfeeding women (at a mean of 4.3 months post-partum) who were being treated with a 50 to 150 mg daily dose of desvenlafaxine for postpartum depression. Sampling was performed at steady state (up to 8 samples) over a 24 hour dosing period, and included foremilk and hindmilk. The mean relative infant dose was calculated to be 6.8% (range of 5.5 to 8.1%). No adverse reactions were seen in the infants.

8.4 Pediatric Use

The safety and effectiveness of desvenlafaxine have not been established in pediatric patients for the treatment of MDD.

Efficacy was not demonstrated in two adequate and well controlled, 8-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group studies conducted in 587 patients (7 to 17 years of age) for the treatment of MDD.

Antidepressants, such as desvenlafaxine, increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors in pediatric patients [see the Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Desvenlafaxine was associated with a decrease in body weight in placebo-controlled trials in pediatric patients with MDD. The incidence of weight loss (≥ 3.5% of baseline weight) was 22%, 14%, and 7% for patients treated with low dose desvenlafaxine, high dose desvenlafaxine, and placebo, respectively.

The risks associated with longer term desvenlafaxine use were assessed in 6-month, open-label extension studies in pediatric patients (7 to 17 years of age) with MDD. Pediatric patients (7 to 17 years of age) had mean changes in weight that approximated expected changes, based on data from age- and sex-matched peers.

Women who discontinue antidepressants during pregnancy are more likely to experience a relapse of major depression than women who continue antidepressants. This finding is from a prospective, longitudinal study of 201 pregnant women with a history of major depressive disorder who were euthymic and taking antidepressants at the beginning of pregnancy. Consider the risk of untreated depression when discontinuing or changing treatment with antidepressant medication during pregnancy and postpartum.

Data

Human Data

While available studies cannot definitively establish the absence of risk, published data from prospective cohort studies, case series, and case reports over several decades have not identified an association with trazodone use during pregnancy and major birth defects, miscarriage, or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. All available studies have methodological limitations, including small sample size and inconsistent comparator groups.

Animal Data

No teratogenic effects were observed when trazodone was given to pregnant rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis at oral doses up to 450 mg/kg/day. This dose is 11 and 22 times, in rats and rabbits, respectively, the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 400 mg/day in adults on a mg/m² basis. Increased fetal resorption and other adverse effects on the fetus in rats at 7.3 to 11 times the MRHD and increase in congenital anomalies in rabbits at 7.3 to 22 times the MRHD on a mg/m² basis were observed. No further details on these studies are available.

8.2 Lactation

Risk Summary

Data from published literature report the transfer of trazodone into human milk. There are no data on the effect of trazodone on milk production. Limited data from postmarketing reports have not identified an association of adverse effects on the breastfed child.

The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for RALDESY and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from RALDESY or from the underlying maternal condition.

8.4 Pediatric Use

Safety and effectiveness of RALDESY in the pediatric patients have not been established.

Antidepressants increased the risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors in pediatric patients [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

### Antidepressant use before, during, and after pregnancy [^114ybqYZ]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Women's lifetime risk of depression is highest during and after pregnancy, and those with a history of depression have particularly high risk of relapses during this period. Choosing whether to continue taking antidepressants during pregnancy can be complicated. Although evidence is limited, there are safety concerns regarding in utero exposure to some antidepressant medications. However, untreated maternal depression can have severe long-term consequences for mother and child.

For women who choose to discontinue antidepressant medication during pregnancy, current guidelines recommend substituting with psychotherapy. Clinicians therefore play an important role in helping women make informed decisions about mental health care during pregnancy. We provide descriptive evidence of the choices women and their clinicians make about depression treatment during pregnancy.

Postpartum depression (PPD) screening — acceptability and implementation are supported, as research confirms that most mothers (80%) are comfortable with the idea of being screened for depression, internationally guidelines and authorities recommend screening for PPD, most physicians and maternal/child healthcare providers agree screening the mother fits within their practice, and the American Academy of Pediatrics and the U.S. Surgeon General's Office call for identification and treatment of mental health disorders including PPD; it is important that screening for PPD be done systematically globally, and providers caring for the infant must refer a mother with a positive screen for appropriate care.

### Maternal use of SSRIs, SNRIs and NaSSAs: practical recommendations during pregnancy and lactation [^1174HwXa]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Fetal and Neonatal Edition (2012). Low credibility.

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are increasingly used during pregnancy and lactation, with 1.8–2.8% exposed pregnancies. Given the risks of untreated maternal depression for both mother and child, adequate treatment is essential. If pharmacological treatment with SSRIs is indicated, the fetal and neonatal effects of SSRIs have to be considered, as SSRIs cross the placenta and are excreted into breast milk. The overall risk of major congenital malformations during SSRI exposure in the first trimester does not appear to be greatly increased. Depending on the variability in pharmacokinetic properties between the different SSRIs and the individual drug metabolism of mother and child, SSRI exposure during late pregnancy can lead to serotonin reuptake inhibitor-related symptoms in up to 30% of exposed infants postnatally. Symptoms are generally mild and self-limited, but need observation during at least 48 h as some infants develop severe symptoms needing intervention. Limited data are available about the long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes after SSRI exposure during pregnancy and lactation, but currently, cognitive development seems normal, while behavioural abnormalities may be increased. In this article, the available clinical data are reviewed. Additionally, the authors provide a multidisciplinary guideline for the monitoring and management of neonates exposed to SSRIs during pregnancy and lactation.

### Postpartum depression [^115VJWQz]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2009). Low credibility.

Postpartum depression (PPD) affects up to 15% of mothers. Recent research has identified several psychosocial and biologic risk factors for PPD. The negative short-term and long-term effects on child development are well-established. PPD is under recognized and under treated. The obstetrician and pediatrician can serve important roles in screening for and treating PPD. Treatment options include psychotherapy and antidepressant medication. Obstacles to compliance with treatment recommendations include access to psychotherapists and concerns of breastfeeding mothers about exposure of the infant to antidepressant medication. Further research is needed to examine systematically the short-term and long-term effect of medication exposure through breastmilk on infant and child development.

### Medications in pregnancy and lactation [^112a3bdK]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Lack of information and misinformation often lead to physicians advising mothers to discontinue breastfeeding because of medication use. Also, many mothers do not adhere to their prescriptions or quit breastfeeding because of medication use. Although in both cases this cessation of breastfeeding is probably based on concern for the infant's safety, the physician may also be influenced by expediency and fear of litigation. The safest course for physicians who are treating nursing mothers is to consult reliable sources before advising discontinuation of breastfeeding. Overwhelming evidence has shown that breastfeeding is the most healthful form of nutrition for babies and should therefore be encouraged by physicians. Physicians should take the following approach to maximize safe maternal medication use for both the mother and the breastfed infant: 1. Determine if medication is necessary. 2. Choose the safest drug available, that is, one that; is safe when administered directly to infants, has a low milk:plasma ratio, has a short half-life, has a high molecular weight, has high protein binding in maternal serum, is ionized in maternal plasma, is less lipophilic. 3. Consultation with the infant's pediatrician is encouraged. 4. Advise the mother to take the medication just after she has breastfed the infant or just before the infant's longest sleep period. 5. If there is a possibility that a drug may risk the health of the infant, arrange for the monitoring of serum drug levels in the infant. Emergency physicians are often faced with the daunting task of treating a large variety of high-acuity patients, including patients who happen to be pregnant or nursing mothers. Priority, of course, needs to be given to life-saving treatment. When physicians are treating pregnant or breastfeeding patients, they need to use reliable resources to evaluate the risks and benefits of the medication for the mother and the infant. Most medications should have no effect on milk supply or on infant well-being. In most cases, treatment plans for patients should include encouragement from the emergency physician that he or she has researched the chosen medicine and that breastfeeding may safely continue.

### Desvenlafaxine succinate [^114RZptZ]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

8.2 Lactation

Risk Summary

Available limited data from published literature show low levels of desvenlafaxine in human milk, and have not shown adverse reactions in breastfed infants (see Data). There are no data on the effects of desvenlafaxine on milk production.

The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for desvenlafaxine and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from desvenlafaxine or from the underlying maternal condition.

Data

A lactation study was conducted in 10 breastfeeding women (at a mean of 4.3 months postpartum) who were being treated with a 50 to 150 mg daily dose of desvenlafaxine for postpartum depression. Sampling was performed at steady state (up to 8 samples) over a 24 hour dosing period, and included foremilk and hindmilk. The mean relative infant dose was calculated to be 6.8% (range of 5.5 to 8.1%). No adverse reactions were seen in the infants.

8.4 Pediatric Use

The safety and effectiveness of desvenlafaxine, have not been established in pediatric patients for the treatment of MDD.

Efficacy was not demonstrated in two adequate and well controlled, 8-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group studies conducted in 587 patients (7 to 17 years of age) for the treatment of MDD.

Antidepressants, such as desvenlafaxine, increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors in pediatric patients [see the Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Desvenlafaxine was associated with a decrease in body weight in placebo controlled trials in pediatric patients with MDD. The incidence of weight loss (≥ 3.5% of baseline weight) was 22%, 14%, and 7% for patients treated with low dose desvenlafaxine, high dose desvenlafaxine, and placebo, respectively.

The risks associated with longer term desvenlafaxine use were assessed in 6-month, open-label extension studies in pediatric patients (7 to 17 years of age) with MDD. Pediatric patients (7 to 17 years of age) had mean changes in weight that approximated expected changes, based on data from age-and sex-matched peers.

The Expert Panel's Policy-Related Considerations

Frequently, pregnancy is a contraindication for enrolling in clinical trials of new medications. However, many panel members noted that it is unethical to exclude pregnant women from drug trials, as the lack of critical data limits clinicians in making evidence-based decisions. Furthermore, inadequate or inappropriate medication use has the potential to increase maternal and fetal risks. These ethical and policy issues are summarized in recent publications. A systematic review by Coverdale et al that focused on randomized placebo-controlled trials of antidepressant medication given to pregnant women concluded that such trials were ethically justified. The argument-based approach emphasizes an ethical framework in which scientific studies should be following. The review endorsed the importance of conducting such trials as they would assist in appropriate treatment and build confidence in the physician's ability to prescribe antidepressant medication. Determining whether the impact on fetal development is due to the drug versus the mood disorder itself is equally important. Filling the knowledge gaps with well-designed studies could lead to new scientific knowledge to address the pressing needs of pregnant women and the intricacies related to medication use.
Safety of medications administered during pregnancy is a major concern for clinicians and patients. Utilizing the robust surveillance system created for vaccines, which is continuously improving, provides an excellent model and starting point for drugs as well. This safety system identifies and evaluates adverse events with a combination of systems and partnerships (Table 1).
The Vaccine and Medications in Pregnancy Surveillance System (VAMPSS), a postmarket surveillance system for vaccines and drugs, conducts case control and prospective cohort studies on certain drugs and vaccines in pregnancy. Birth defects are the main outcomes for these studies, and there is currently a need to broaden assessment to include long-term effects of these small numbers of drugs (asthma medications) and vaccines (influenza and Tdap).

Other treatments for chronic pain

Amitriptyline

NICE guidance and a systematic review described amitriptyline use in pregnancy. Notably, the evidence base underlying amitriptyline use in pregnancy comes from its use as a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) to treat depression at doses of 150–300 mg and evidence of its use in pregnancy to treat chronic widespread pain at 75 mg per day or less is lacking. In addition, most studies report on TCAs as a drug class and although they include (some) women exposed to amitriptyline, they lack a separate assessment of their pregnancy outcomes so do not provide information about specific amitriptyline exposure.

Overall, no increased risk of congenital malformations has been found for TCAs. UKTIS reports conflicting findings, with possible associations with spontaneous abortion, preterm delivery, and autism spectrum disorder identified in some (but not all) studies. There is an association between discontinuation of antidepressants and a high risk for relapse of mood disorders that can adversely impact on pregnancy. It is unknown, however, whether a similar phenomenon of rebound pain exists when antidepressants used for analgesia are discontinued in pregnancy, particularly for amitriptyline that is used at 2–4-fold higher doses to treat depression compared with chronic pain. If a decision is made to stop amitriptyline in pregnancy, the dose should be tapered gradually where possible.

Low levels of amitriptyline and its metabolites are reported in breastmilk with no adverse effects described with limited follow-up, summarised in LactMed. The following recommendations were based on evidence as shown in Supplementary Table S4, available at Rheumatology online.

Recommendations for amitriptyline in pregnancy and breastfeeding

Amitriptyline is compatible with pregnancy. There is no evidence of adverse effect on IQ or developmental outcomes (GRADE 1C, SOA 100).
Because very little amitriptyline is found in breastmilk with antidepressant doses and it is used at lower doses for chronic pain, it is unlikely to cause adverse effects in breastfed infants (GRADE 1C, SOA 100).

Counseling is advised as "The American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Drugs recommends that a nursing mother be informed that the infant will be exposed to maternal medications (304)". Measurement and monitoring guidance notes "No consensus exists regarding how best to measure infant exposure (305), but sertraline and paroxetine appear least likely to produce detectable or elevated infant plasma drug levels (303)" and "Monitoring maternal or breast milk antidepressant levels is not recommended (303)". A timing strategy is described: "Discarding the breast milk 8–9 hours after taking sertraline reduces infant exposure by a little more than 15% (305)".

### Brexanolone, zuranolone and related neurosteroid GABAreceptor positive allosteric modulators for postnatal depression [^114SRPcZ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Description of the intervention

British perinatal guidelines recommend a stepped‐care approach to treating PND, with antidepressants advised for women experiencing more severe symptoms, either alone or in combination with psychological therapy (McAllister‐Williams 2017; NICE 2020). Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have been the most commonly prescribed antidepressants during pregnancy and the postpartum period, and have a relatively favourable reproductive safety profile (McAllister‐Williams 2017).

However, many antidepressants are associated with limited response, or extended time to response, remission, or both (Brown 2021). These antidepressants do not directly relate to the putative pathophysiology of PND. GABA (gamma‐aminobutyric acid) is an inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system. Pre‐clinical and clinical studies in PND have highlighted the potential role of dysfunctional GABAergic signalling, suggesting that positive allosteric modulation of GABA A receptors may provide a promising mechanism of action for emerging pharmacotherapy (Meltzer‐Brody 2020). Such insights into the role of GABAergic signalling in PND have led to the development of a number of PND treatments that act as allosteric modulators of GABA A receptors. These include an intravenous (IV) infusion of a neuroactive steroid, allopregnanolone, known as brexanolone (also known as Zulresso or SAGE‐547). In 2019, the United States' Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the use of brexanolone for the treatment of PND in women, making it the first medication approved specifically for the treatment of PND. However, it is not yet approved for use in the UK. Brexanolone is administered intravenously over 60 hours with close monitoring, due to concerns about the risk of excessive sedation. Since brexanolone, other inhibitory neurosteroids have also been developed. In 2023, the FDA approved another version of allopregnanolone modified for oral administration: zuranolone (also known as SAGE‐217). It is administered as a 14‐day oral course. As with brexanolone, it has yet to be approved for use in the UK.

The safety of medication for PND while breastfeeding is also an important consideration for any PND treatment. PND has potential adverse effects for mother and baby (Howard 2014; Stein 2014). These adverse effects need to be weighed against the risks of medication exposure via breast milk, which are sometimes uncertain (McAllister‐Williams 2017).

### British Society for Rheumatology guideline on prescribing drugs in pregnancy and breastfeeding: comorbidity medications used in rheumatology practice [^117Vfju7]. Rheumatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs)

NICE guidance and two systematic reviews described SNRI use in pregnancy. There was no association between first trimester exposure to venlafaxine and an increased risk for major congenital malformations. UKTIS notes that although there are some reports of an increased risk of miscarriage following gestational exposure to venlafaxine, the data are inconsistent and likely confounded by indication and other factors. Some studies have found a possible association with an increased risk for some perinatal complications, including a withdrawal syndrome with venlafaxine use in the third trimester. A more limited data set for duloxetine does not suggest a clinically important increased risk for major malformations but has identified prenatal antidepressant exposure syndrome in two of five case reports and conflicting reports of increased rates of gestational hypertension and spontaneous abortion.

LactMed reports that infants receive venlafaxine and its active metabolite in breastmilk, and the metabolite of the drug can be found in the plasma of most breastfed infants, but no proven drug-related side effects have been reported in small case series. Little published information is available on the use of duloxetine during breastfeeding; however, the dose in milk is low and serum levels were low in two breastfed infants. The following recommendations were based on evidence as shown in Supplementary Table S4, available at Rheumatology online.

Recommendations for SNRIs in pregnancy and breastfeeding

Venlafaxine is compatible at conception and throughout pregnancy. There may be an increased risk of neonatal abstinence syndrome/short-term behavioural effects, but larger studies are needed to evaluate this finding (GRADE 2C, SOA 95.8).
Duloxetine may be considered in pregnancy and breastfeeding but there are fewer data than for venlafaxine (GRADE 2C, SOA 95.3).
Venlafaxine and duloxetine may be considered in breastfeeding if there is no alternative chronic pain medication (GRADE 2C, SOA 95.8).

### Improving safe and effective use of drugs in pregnancy and lactation: workshop summary [^112h8qxn]. American Journal of Perinatology (2017). Low credibility.

Professional entities including SMFM, ACOG, and AAP strongly advocate that women breast-feed their infants because of its numerous maternal and neonatal health benefits. Breast-feeding rates have increased approximately 2% per year between 1996 and 2001. Stultz et al studied 46 women who provided medication history during their pregnancy and while they breast-fed their infants. In this cohort, there was a significant increase in both prescription and OTC medication use during lactation compared with when they were pregnant. More than 70% of women were taking medications that were potentially unsafe, or had unknown safety profiles. Anderson et al evaluated 100 articles between 1966 and 2002 to examine possible adverse outcomes in neonates due to their exposure to maternal medication(s) during breast-feeding. These authors reported that 47% of adverse outcomes in the neonates as "possibly" linked to medication exposure during breast-feeding; 53% as "probably" linked and no infant-related deaths were associated with medications. However, there is little research focusing on understanding the quantity of medication and their chemical effects on neonates during breast-feeding.

Only 5% of the 213 new pharmaceuticals approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) between 2003 and 2012 contained human data in their pregnancy section; almost one-half did not have any safety information concerning the medication use for lactating women. Because of the lack of studies on specific drugs in pregnancy and lactation, the efficacy and dosing data are generally extrapolated from studies from adult subjects (men and nonpregnant women) and safety data are collated from the FDA-mandated postmarket surveillance. Such data often come from the use of pregnancy-exposure registries that, while useful, are greatly limited by inherent design biases.

During the workshop, the expert panel focused on the "current" state of practice and reviewed available data on select drugs in pregnancy. The group discussed what providers optimally should know about the pharmacokinetics of drugs particularly given the physiologic changes that occur in the course of pregnancy and postpartum, as well as the time of greatest vulnerability in terms of drug effects on the fetus and newborn. There was evidence presented about the interaction of drugs and breast milk, indicating that some assumptions could be made about the efficiency with which certain drugs may cross into breast milk and potentially pose further exposure risks to the neonate. Potential lessons learned from the pediatric experience with enrolling children in drug trials to enhance knowledge in this unique population and the robust safety systems in place to monitor vaccines were reviewed. The presentations and discussions from the 2-day workshop are summarized here.

### Clinical lactation studies. acting on key recommendations over the last decade [^114P8QrT]. Npj Women's Health (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Since the 1990s, especially after the Women's Health initiative (WHI) was established in 1992, there has been increased emphasis on generation of evidence to guide clinical practice and develop therapeutics for conditions that predominantly affect women. Although this was ground-breaking, the WHI by design focussed on preventive strategies for chronic disorders like cancer, healthier ageing, and postmenopausal disorders, and thereby neglected to focus on the disposition and safety of drugs in Women of Child-Bearing Potential (WOCBP). Within the demographic of WOCBP, different categories of women exist; some who wish to conceive, and others who may be in different stages of pregnancy, postpartum and/or breastfeeding. It is estimated that more than half of all breastfeeding women worldwide require drug therapy. However, in most situations, clear evidence quantitatively describing drug transfer from mother to breastfed infants (through breastmilk) and informing the clinical risk-to-benefit ratio does not exist. This evidence gap may preclude prescribing such therapeutics in the real-world setting. This applies to both established and newly approved therapeutics. A 2016 review by the FDA scrutinising the eligibility criteria of trials of 38 drugs approved between 2014 and 2017 observed that lactation was among the most frequent exclusion criteria.

### Psilocybin during the postpartum period induces long-lasting adverse effects in both mothers and offspring [^115hDRGT]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

While our rodent model of postpartum depression possesses face and construct validity and may be useful for modeling various aspects of the disease, it is possible that it is not well suited to assess the efficacy of psychedelic compounds given that these molecules induce uniquely human subjective experiences. Moreover, the long-lasting detrimental behavioral effects measured in the offspring of dams exposed to psilocybin can likely be mitigated in humans by cessation of breastfeeding for an appropriate length of time. However, the lasting detrimental effects of psilocybin exposure during the postpartum period that we observe is in direct contrast to the lasting therapeutic effects of psilocybin exposure to nonparous females, effects that have been observed in preclinical and clinical studies.

Altogether, the data presented here suggest that while psilocybin has been consistently shown to be safe and effective for treating depression in the general human patient population, as well as in preclinical models of mental health disorders, the same may not be true for exposure during the postpartum period. The postpartum period remains an incredibly understudied aspect of human physiology, making postpartum people amongst the most vulnerable of demographics to unexpected adverse events in response to prescription or experimental new drugs. Peripartum mood disorders such as postpartum depression are in urgent need for novel, safe, effective and fast-acting therapeutics, and our study underscores the need to closely monitor behavioral outcomes in birthing parents and their offspring to establish the safety and efficacy of administering psychedelics during the postpartum period.

### Psychiatric medication use in pregnancy and breastfeeding [^112FzG5e]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

Active peripartum psychiatric illness is associated with adverse outcomes for exposed pregnancies/children. Likely due to high rates of obesity, pregnant women with psychiatric illness also have higher rates of preeclampsia, cesarean section, and gestational diabetes. Postpartum depression is associated with lower IQ, slower language development, and behavioral problems in exposed children. Discontinuing psychiatric medications for pregnancy increases risk for relapse significantly, and the postpartum time period is high risk for developing psychiatric illness. Obstetricians-gynecologists are front-line providers for psychiatric care of women during peripartum. This article provides a framework and knowledge base for management of psychiatric illness during peripartum.

### Citalopram (Citalopram hydrobromide) [^116j8AcA]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Nursing Mothers

As has been found to occur with many other drugs, citalopram is excreted in human breast milk. There have been two reports of infants experiencing excessive somnolence, decreased feeding and weight loss in association with breastfeeding from a citalopram-treated mother; in one case, the infant was reported to recover completely upon discontinuation of citalopram by its mother and in the second case, no follow-up information was available. The decision whether to continue or discontinue either nursing or citalopram therapy should take into account the risks of citalopram exposure for the infant and the benefits of citalopram treatment for the mother.

Pediatric Use

Safety and effectiveness in the pediatric population have not been established (see BOXED WARNING and WARNINGS — Clinical Worsening and Suicide Risk .) Two placebo-controlled trials in 407 pediatric patients with MDD have been conducted with citalopram, and the data were not sufficient to support a claim for use in pediatric patients. Anyone considering the use of citalopram in a child or adolescent must balance the potential risks with the clinical need.

Decreased appetite and weight loss have been observed in association with the use of SSRIs. Consequently, regular monitoring of weight and growth should be performed in children and adolescents treated with citalopram.

Geriatric Use

of 4,422 patients in clinical studies of citalopram, 1,357 were 60 and over, 1,034 were 65 and over, and 457 were 75 and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. Most elderly patients treated with citalopram in clinical trials received daily doses between 20 mg and 40 mg (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).

SSRIs and SNRIs, including citalopram, have been associated with cases of clinically significant hyponatremia in elderly patients, who may be at greater risk for this adverse event (see PRECAUTIONS, Hyponatremia).

In two pharmacokinetic studies, citalopram AUC was increased by 23% and 30%, respectively, in subjects ≥ 60 years of age as compared to younger subjects, and its half-life was increased by 30% and 50%, respectively (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY).

20 mg/day is the maximum recommended dose for patients who are greater than 60 years of age (see WARNINGS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).
