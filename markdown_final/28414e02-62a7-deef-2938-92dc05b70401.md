## Question

Conjunctivitis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about conjunctivitis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core definition and classification to anchor the diagnostic framework. Then, I should verify the epidemiology and why it matters for pretest probability. Next, I will examine the differential diagnosis and the limits of clinical differentiation, followed by a careful, stepwise diagnostic approach. After that, I need to review evidence-based treatment by etiology, including special populations and stewardship. Finally, I should confirm prevention, public health, and follow-up strategies, and close with a concise synthesis that aligns with guidelines and high-quality evidence.

> Let me first confirm the definition and classification so I don't gloss over fundamentals. Conjunctivitis is inflammation of the conjunctiva, and the major etiologic buckets are infectious (viral, bacterial, fungal, parasitic), noninfectious (allergic, toxic/irritative, immune-mediated, neoplastic), and mechanical/traumatic, with viral and allergic being the most common in adults and bacterial relatively more common in children, which will shape testing and treatment thresholds [^113eJ6MH] [^1138Wf4y] [^112ByJSW].

> Wait, let me verify the epidemiology before I jump to conclusions about likelihoods. Viral conjunctivitis accounts for roughly 80% of acute infectious cases, with adenovirus predominating, whereas bacterial etiologies are more frequent in children; overall, acute conjunctivitis affects millions annually in the U.S. and drives substantial direct and indirect costs, reinforcing the need to avoid unnecessary antibiotics and to counsel on contagion and return-to-work/school issues [^1138Wf4y] [^112ByJSW] [^112R7n8i].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about distinguishing viral from bacterial disease based on discharge alone. I initially thought mucopurulent discharge reliably indicates bacteria, but I should double-check that assumption because purulence has poor specificity; in fact, recent pathogen surveillance shows purulent discharge in 62% of cases yet only 8% had confirmed bacterial pathogens, and no single sign or symptom reliably separates viral from bacterial etiologies, so I need to rely on a constellation of features and, when needed, selective testing rather than reflex antibiotics [^116vSDS7] [^112ByJSW] [^116ZAFRG].

> I will now examine the differential diagnosis systematically so I don't miss sight-threatening masqueraders. Beyond viral, bacterial, and allergic conjunctivitis, I should consider HSV/VZV keratoconjunctivitis, chlamydial disease, contact lens–related keratitis, dry eye, blepharitis, corneal abrasion/foreign body, anterior uveitis, acute angle-closure glaucoma, scleritis, and orbital cellulitis; red flags mandating urgent ophthalmology referral include severe pain, vision loss, corneal involvement, severe purulent discharge, marked photophobia, or a vesicular rash on lids/nose, and I should confirm that these are emphasized in primary care and ophthalmology guidance [^114ZswsT] [^113ttBcu] [^115FXmnz].

> Next, I should review the diagnostic approach and make sure I'm not over-ordering tests. In most immunocompetent adults with classic features, diagnosis is clinical; cultures are reserved for neonates, severe/chronic/recurrent purulent cases, immunocompromised hosts, or treatment failure, and viral PCR or AdenoPlus may be considered when the result would change management or for outbreak control, though sensitivity varies and negative results do not exclude adenovirus; I need to ensure I document history, visual acuity, discharge character, lymphadenopathy, corneal clarity, and contact lens use before deciding on testing [^117Pgase] [^1131JSeQ] [^116ZAFRG].

> Let me think about viral conjunctivitis management, and I should confirm that I'm aligned with stewardship. There is no proven antiviral to eradicate adenovirus; treatment is supportive with artificial tears, cold compresses, strict hygiene, and patient education on contagion, with avoidance of topical antibiotics; in severe adenoviral disease with pseudomembranes or subepithelial infiltrates, a short, carefully tapered course of topical corticosteroid may be considered with close follow-up, acknowledging potential risks and the lack of definitive human data on viral shedding prolongation; I should also remember that povidone-iodine with or without steroid has emerging but still limited evidence and is not standard of care pending larger trials [^1179x62B] [^116UHwaU] [^1162uG8f] [^1152n9Bk].

> I should confirm bacterial conjunctivitis guidance and the strength of evidence. Most mild cases in immunocompetent adults resolve spontaneously, but topical antibiotics modestly improve clinical and microbiologic cure and reduce persistence; delayed prescribing yields similar symptom control while halving antibiotic use; choice of agent is less critical than judicious use, with erythromycin ointment or a topical fluoroquinolone reasonable depending on availability and severity; I need to ensure I avoid steroids in undifferentiated bacterial disease and reserve them for severe inflammation with ophthalmology input [^115L23qK] [^115WeUv1] [^116E3SJr] [^113614g7].

> But wait, what if the patient is a neonate or has hyperacute disease. I should double-check that all neonatal conjunctivitis warrants hospital-based evaluation and systemic therapy coverage for gonorrhea and chlamydia, with topical adjuncts as indicated; in adults with hyperacute, copious purulent discharge, I must consider gonococcal disease and treat urgently to prevent corneal compromise, using systemic ceftriaxone plus topical therapy and partner management, ideally with infectious diseases or ophthalmology coordination [^111ZZNqp] [^116UHwaU].

> Let me consider allergic conjunctivitis so I don't conflate it with infection. Itching is the hallmark, often bilateral and seasonal, with watery or mucoid discharge; first-line therapy includes topical antihistamines, mast-cell stabilizers, or combination drops, with cold compresses and allergen avoidance; for vernal/atopic disease flares, a short, carefully monitored steroid course may be needed, and I should confirm that indiscriminate antibiotic or steroid use is discouraged to avoid toxicity or exacerbation [^115mqPVn] [^115N4ftS] [^116UHwaU].

> I need to ensure I address contact lens wearers specifically. Contact lens–associated red eye carries a higher risk of Pseudomonas keratitis, so I should stop lens wear, avoid patching, and arrange prompt ophthalmology evaluation if there is pain, photophobia, corneal opacity, or infiltrate; empiric topical antibiotics with antipseudomonal coverage may be started while awaiting culture if keratitis is suspected, and I should not delay referral when red flags are present [^114ZswsT] [^113ttBcu].

> Next, I should review prevention and public health measures because contagion drives spread and misperceptions. Viral and bacterial conjunctivitis are highly contagious via direct and indirect contact; patients should maintain strict hand hygiene, avoid eye rubbing, and not share towels, pillows, or makeup; in adenoviral disease, patients should minimize close contact for 10–14 days from onset in the last affected eye, and in congregate settings, exclusion policies should balance severity and public health risk while avoiding unnecessary school or work absences [^116ReYNy] [^114LJtjF] [^11755Euo].

> Hold on, I should verify follow-up and referral triggers so I don't miss deterioration. Routine follow-up is not needed for mild, improving cases, but patients should return if pain worsens, vision declines, corneal involvement is suspected, or symptoms persist beyond about a week; urgent ophthalmology referral is indicated for severe pain, vision loss, corneal opacity, marked purulence, vesicular lid lesions, immunocompromise, or failure to improve with appropriate therapy, and virtual consultation can triage many non-sight-threatening cases while expediting urgent referrals when red flags are present [^115FXmnz] [^113ttBcu].

> Let me synthesize the practical approach to ensure internal consistency. In adults, assume viral and self-limited unless features suggest otherwise; provide supportive care and avoid antibiotics; in children, maintain a lower threshold for bacterial disease and consider antibiotics when features are convincing or when social pressures justify treatment; across ages, avoid topical steroids unless there is severe inflammation with ophthalmology oversight; and always screen for red flags that mandate urgent referral, documenting visual acuity, corneal status, and lymphadenopathy to guide decisions and counseling [^116UHwaU] [^114ZswsT] [^112ByJSW].

---

Conjunctivitis is most often **viral and self-limited** [^1138Wf4y], requiring only supportive care and strict hygiene to limit spread [^116ReYNy] [^114LJtjF]. Bacterial conjunctivitis is more common in children [^112ByJSW] and may be treated with topical antibiotics to shorten duration and reduce transmission [^115L23qK] [^116E3SJr]; delayed prescribing is reasonable in mild cases [^115WeUv1]. Allergic conjunctivitis is managed with topical antihistamines/mast-cell stabilizers and allergen avoidance [^115mqPVn] [^115N4ftS]. Red flags (pain, vision loss, corneal involvement, immunocompromise) [^113ttBcu] require urgent ophthalmology referral [^115FXmnz]. No single sign reliably distinguishes viral from bacterial disease [^112ByJSW], so avoid routine antibiotics unless bacterial disease is likely or severe [^114aP5sv] [^1112KZBq].

---

## Etiology and classification

Conjunctivitis is classified as **infectious or noninfectious** [^113eJ6MH]:

| **Category** | **Common causes** |
|-|-|
| Infectious | - Viral (adenovirus most common) [^1138Wf4y] [^1162uG8f] <br/> - Bacterial (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae) [^1138Wf4y] [^114Gxx2a] <br/> - Sexually transmitted (Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae) [^116UHwaU] [^1138Wf4y] |
| Noninfectious | - Allergic (seasonal, perennial) [^115mqPVn] [^115N4ftS] <br/> - Irritant (chemicals, smoke, contact lenses) [^116PufGo] <br/> - Immune-mediated (dry eye, autoimmune) [^113eJ6MH] |

---

## Clinical presentation

Typical features include **redness, discharge, tearing, itching, and irritation** [^1154u44P]; specific findings help distinguish etiologies:

- **Viral**: watery discharge, follicular conjunctiva, preauricular nodes, often URI symptoms [^1138Wf4y] [^112ByJSW].
- **Bacterial**: purulent discharge, eyelid matting, papillary conjunctiva [^1138Wf4y] [^112ByJSW].
- **Allergic**: intense itching, watery discharge, bilateral, seasonal [^115mqPVn] [^115N4ftS].

---

## Diagnosis

Diagnosis is **primarily clinical** [^116ZAFRG]; no single sign reliably separates viral from bacterial disease [^112ByJSW]. Testing is reserved for severe, recurrent, or unresponsive cases: cultures for neonates, chronic/severepurulent cases, or immunocompromised patients [^117Pgase] [^1131JSeQ], and rapid adenoviral assays (e.g. AdenoPlus) may reduce unnecessary antibiotics but have variable sensitivity [^1131JSeQ].

---

## Management by etiology

### Viral conjunctivitis

- **Supportive care**: artificial tears, cold compresses, strict hygiene [^1179x62B] [^114LJtjF].
- **Contagion**: highly contagious; minimize contact for 10–14 days [^116ReYNy] [^114zXC3p].
- **Steroids**: avoid routine use; consider only for severe inflammation with ophthalmology oversight [^1179x62B] [^1166jyEm].

---

### Bacterial conjunctivitis

- **Antibiotics**: modestly shorten duration and reduce transmission [^115L23qK] [^116E3SJr]; delayed prescribing is reasonable in mild cases [^115WeUv1].
- **Choice**: topical antibiotics (e.g. erythromycin, trimethoprim-polymyxin B, fluoroquinolones) [^115L23qK]; no clear superiority among agents [^116sHGce].
- **STI**: systemic therapy for gonorrhea/chlamydia; treat partners [^116UHwaU] [^115mqPVn].

---

### Allergic conjunctivitis

Allergic conjunctivitis is managed with **topical antihistamines/mast-cell stabilizers** [^115mqPVn] and allergen avoidance [^115N4ftS]; a short course of topical corticosteroids may be used for severe flares with ophthalmology supervision [^116UHwaU].

---

## Prevention and public health considerations

Prevention relies on **hand hygiene**, avoiding shared personal items, and contact lens hygiene [^114LJtjF] [^11755Euo]. School policies often allow return after 24 hours of antibiotics, though evidence is limited; prioritize hygiene and symptom control [^116PufGo].

---

## Complications and when to refer

Most cases resolve without sequelae, but **complications** can occur: corneal involvement (keratitis, infiltrates), chronic conjunctivitis, or vision loss [^112rQKH5]. Urgent ophthalmology referral is indicated for severe pain, vision loss, corneal involvement, immunocompromise, or failure to improve within 48–72 hours [^113ttBcu] [^115FXmnz].

---

## Special populations

- **Neonates**: hospital evaluation and systemic therapy for gonorrhea/chlamydia [^111ZZNqp] [^117Pgase].
- **Contact lens wearers**: high risk for keratitis; stop lenses and refer if pain, photophobia, or corneal involvement [^114ZswsT] [^115FXmnz].
- **Immunocompromised**: higher risk of severe disease; lower threshold for cultures and specialist input [^117Pgase].

---

## Emerging therapies and research

Povidone-iodine with or without dexamethasone shows promise for adenoviral conjunctivitis but remains investigational [^1162uG8f] [^1152n9Bk]. Antibiotic stewardship efforts focus on **reducing unnecessary prescribing** and promoting delayed prescribing [^115WeUv1] [^117E7fSP].

---

Conjunctivitis is common and usually benign; **accurate diagnosis and etiology-specific care** minimize overtreatment, reduce transmission, and prevent complications. Reserve antibiotics for likely bacterial disease or severe cases, and escalate care promptly when red flags appear [^116UHwaU].

## References

### Bacterial conjunctivitis [^114Gxx2a]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2012). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Most cases of conjunctivitis in adults are probably due to viral infection, but children are more likely to develop bacterial conjunctivitis than they are viral forms. The main bacterial pathogens are Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae in adults and children, and Moraxella catarrhalis in children. Contact lens wearers may be more likely to develop gram-negative infections. Bacterial keratitis occurs in up to 30 per 100,000 contact lens wearers.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of empirical treatment in adults and children with suspected bacterial conjunctivitis? What are the effects of treatment in adults and children with bacteriologically confirmed bacterial conjunctivitis? What are the effects of treatment in adults and children with clinically confirmed gonococcal conjunctivitis? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to July 2011 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 44 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: ocular decongestants, oral antibiotics, parenteral antibiotics, saline, topical antibiotics, and warm compresses.

### A review of the differential diagnosis of acute infectious conjunctivitis: implications for treatment and management [^117SpSi8]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2020). Medium credibility.

Abstract

The diagnosis of acute infectious conjunctivitis can be difficult. Clinical ambiguity exists between the acute viral and bacterial as well as the allergic forms, which can confound diagnosis. Also, discrimination between viral or bacterial origins of infectious conjunctivitis based on historical, nonspecific, clinical signs and symptoms contributes to a high rate of misdiagnosis and overuse of antibiotic treatment. Therefore, in order to effectively treat acute infectious conjunctivitis, physicians must be aware of the clinical signs and symptoms and available diagnostic tests that can provide a more accurate differential diagnosis.

### A review of the differential diagnosis of acute infectious conjunctivitis: implications for treatment and management [^113PBcU1]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Diagnosis of acute infectious conjunctivitis is complicated because of the signs and symptoms that overlap with other inflammatory conjunctival conditions; therefore, likelihood for misdiagnosis remains high. Misdiagnosis of viral conjunctivitis as bacterial conjunctivitis may result in inappropriate use of antibiotics, which in turn contributes to increased antibiotic resistance. Additionally, misdiagnosis may lead to impaired quality of life and lost productivity due to poor outcomes. Adherence to the American Academy of Ophthalmology evidence-based treatment guidelines and greater educational efforts directed at both patients and physicians could improve the management of acute infectious conjunctivitis. Prescription of antibiotics should be delayed until a bacterial etiology is confirmed, and educational pamphlets should be distributed to general and emergency care practitioners. Development of novel agents with broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity may offer potential new approaches without the drawback of resistance.

Introduction

Conjunctivitis is a collective term for a diverse group of diseases that are characterized by inflammation of the conjunctiva. The most common cause of infectious conjunctivitis is viral infection (~80% of cases), followed by bacterial. The noninfectious forms are allergic, mechanical/irritative/toxic, immune-mediated, and neoplastic. Of noninfectious conjunctivitis, the allergic form is the most common, affecting approximately 40% of the US population. Conjunctivitis can also be classified as acute, chronic, or recurrent, according to the mode of onset and severity of the clinical response. Most cases of viral and bacterial conjunctivitis are considered acute and, less frequently, as hyperacute. The mechanical/irritative/toxic, immune-mediated, and neoplastic forms are typically associated with chronic inflammation, and the toxic form can have an acute onset. Allergic conjunctivitis can be chronic, with possible onset in childhood, and present with acute exacerbations related to seasonal factors or contact lens use, for example.

Conjunctivitis is a highly common presentation in the primary care setting. It is responsible for ~2% of all medical consultations in the United Statesand countless self-referrals to community pharmacies. It is difficult to accurately capture the true epidemiology of conjunctivitis because of the high numbers of patients who may self-medicate or delay or decline to seek medical care, and because of inaccurate diagnosis in the primary medical care setting. Approximately 70% of all patients with acute red eye present to primary care and urgent care, posing a large economic and social burden.–The pharmacoeconomic impact of infectious conjunctivitis is noteworthy and includes the cost of repeat diagnoses, referrals, insurance copays, patient medications, and lost productivity associated with absence from work or school. In the United States, acute conjunctivitis affects an estimated 6 million people per year, and bacterial conjunctivitis treatment alone costs the United States $377–857 million annually. To the best of our knowledge, no health-related quality-of-life studies of patients with acute infectious conjunctivitis have been published.

The purpose of this narrative review is to provide practical guidance on the differentiation of acute infectious conjunctivitis in the primary care setting and to highlight disconnects between diagnosis and treatment.

### Conjunctivitis preferred practice pattern ® [^114aP5sv]. Ophthalmology (2019). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for infectious conjunctivitis, more specifically with respect to topical antibiotics, AAO 2019 guidelines recommend to avoid prescribing topical antibiotics indiscriminately, as viral conjunctivitis will not respond to antibacterial agents, and mild bacterial conjunctivitis is likely to be self-limited and typically resolves spontaneously without specific treatment in immunocompetent adults.

### Topical pharmacologic interventions versus placebo for epidemic keratoconjunctivitis [^1162uG8f]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Viruses cause about 80% of all cases of acute conjunctivitis. Human adenoviruses are believed to account for 65% to 90% of cases of viral conjunctivitis, or 20% to 75% of all causes of infectious keratoconjunctivitis worldwide. Epidemic keratoconjunctivitis (EKC) is a highly contagious subset of adenoviral conjunctivitis that has been associated with large outbreaks at military installations and at medical facilities. It is accompanied by severe conjunctival inflammation, watery discharge, and light sensitivity, and can lead to chronic complications such as corneal and conjunctival scarring with discomfort and poor quality of vision. Due to a lack of consensus on the efficacy of any pharmacotherapy to alter the clinical course of EKC, no standard of care exists, therefore many clinicians offer only supportive care.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and safety of topical pharmacological therapies versus placebo, an active control, or no treatment for adults with EKC.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register; 2021, Issue 4); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid Embase; Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences database (LILACS); ClinicalTrials.gov; and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP), with no restrictions on language or year of publication. The date of the last search was 27 April 2021.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials in which antiseptic agents, virustatic agents, or topical immune-modulating therapy was compared with placebo, an active control, or no treatment.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methodology.

Main Results

We identified 10 studies conducted in Asia, Europe, the Middle East, and North Africa with a total of 892 participants who were treated for 7 days to 6 months and followed for 7 days up to 1.5 years. Study characteristics and risk of bias In most studies participants were predominantly men (range: 44% to 90%), with an age range from 9 to 82 years. Three studies reported information on trial registration, but we found no published study protocol. The majority of trials had small sample sizes, ranging from 18 to 90 participants enrolled per study; the only exception was a trial that enrolled 350 participants. We judged most studies to be at high or unclear risk of bias across risk of bias domains. Findings We included 10 studies of 892 EKC participants and estimated combined intervention effects in analyses stratified by steroid-containing control treatment or artificial tears. Six trials contributed to the comparisons of topical interventions (povidone-iodine [PVP-I], trifluridine, ganciclovir, dexamethasone plus neomycin) with artificial tears (or saline). Very low certainty evidence from two trials comparing trifluridine or ganciclovir with artificial tears showed inconsistent effects on shortening the mean duration of cardinal symptoms or signs of EKC. Low certainty evidence based on two studies (409 participants) indicated that participants treated with PVP-I alone more often experienced resolution of symptoms (risk ratio (RR) 1.15, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.07 to 1.24) and signs (RR 3.19, 95% CI 2.29 to 4.45) during the first week of treatment compared with those treated with artificial tears. Very low certainty evidence from two studies (77 participants) suggested that PVP-I or ganciclovir prevented the development of subepithelial infiltrates (SEI) when compared with artificial tears within 30 days of treatment (RR 0.24, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.56). Four studies compared topical interventions (tacrolimus, cyclosporin A [CsA], trifluridine, PVP-I + dexamethasone) with topical steroids, and one trial compared fluorometholone (FML) plus polyvinyl alcohol iodine (PVA-I) with FML plus levofloxacin. Evidence from one trial showed that more eyes receiving PVP-I 1.0% plus dexamethasone 0.1% had symptoms resolved by day seven compared with those receiving dexamethasone alone (RR 9.00, 95% CI 1.23 to 66.05; 52 eyes). In two trials, fewer eyes treated with PVP-I or PVA-I plus steroid developed SEI within 15 days of treatment compared with steroid alone or steroid plus levofloxacin (RR 0.08, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.55; 69 eyes). One study found that CsA was no more effective than steroid for resolving SEI within four weeks of treatment (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.06; N = 88). The evidence from trials comparing topical interventions with steroids was overall of very low level certainty. Adverse effects Antiviral or antimicrobial agents plus steroid did not differ from artificial tears in terms of ocular discomfort upon instillation (RR 9.23, 95% CI 0.61 to 140.67; N = 19). CsA and tacrolimus eye drops were associated with more cases of severe ocular discomfort, and sometimes intolerance, when compared with steroids (RR 4.64, 95% CI 1.15 to 18.71; 2 studies; N = 141). Compared with steroids, tacrolimus did not increase the risk of elevated intraocular pressure (RR 0.07, 95% CI 0 to 1.13; 1 study; N = 80), while trifluridine conferred no additional risk compared to tear substitute (RR 5.50, 95% CI 0.31 to 96.49; 1 study; N = 97). Overall, bacterial superinfection was rare (one in 23 CsA users) and not associated with use of the intervention steroid (RR 3.63, 95% CI 0.15 to 84.98; N = 51). The evidence for all estimates was of low or very low certainty.

Authors' Conclusions

The evidence for the seven specified outcomes was of low or very low certainty due to imprecision and high risk of bias. The evidence that antiviral agents shorten the duration of symptoms or signs when compared with artificial tears was inconclusive. Low certainty evidence suggests that PVP-I alone resolves signs and symptoms by seven days relative to artificial tears. PVP-I or PVA-I, alone or with steroid, is associated with lower risks of SEI development than artificial tears or steroid (very low certainty evidence). The currently available evidence is insufficient to determine whether any of the evaluated interventions confers an advantage over steroids or artificial tears with respect to virus eradication or its spread to initially uninvolved fellow eyes. Future updates of this review should provide evidence of high-level certainty from trials with larger sample sizes, enrollment of participants with similar durations of signs and symptoms, and validated methods to assess short- and long-term outcomes.

### Conjunctivitis: a systematic review of diagnosis and treatment [^115mqPVn]. JAMA (2013). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Conjunctivitis is a common problem.

Objective

To examine the diagnosis, management, and treatment of conjunctivitis, including various antibiotics and alternatives to antibiotic use in infectious conjunctivitis and use of antihistamines and mast cell stabilizers in allergic conjunctivitis.

Evidence Review

A search of the literature published through March 2013, using PubMed, the ISI Web of Knowledge database, and the Cochrane Library was performed. Eligible articles were selected after review of titles, abstracts, and references.

Findings

Viral conjunctivitis is the most common overall cause of infectious conjunctivitis and usually does not require treatment; the signs and symptoms at presentation are variable. Bacterial conjunctivitis is the second most common cause of infectious conjunctivitis, with most uncomplicated cases resolving in 1 to 2 weeks. Mattering and adherence of the eyelids on waking, lack of itching, and absence of a history of conjunctivitis are the strongest factors associated with bacterial conjunctivitis. Topical antibiotics decrease the duration of bacterial conjunctivitis and allow earlier return to school or work. Conjunctivitis secondary to sexually transmitted diseases such as chlamydia and gonorrhea requires systemic treatment in addition to topical antibiotic therapy. Allergic conjunctivitis is encountered in up to 40% of the population, but only a small proportion of these individuals seek medical help; itching is the most consistent sign in allergic conjunctivitis, and treatment consists of topical antihistamines and mast cell inhibitors.

Conclusions and Relevance

The majority of cases in bacterial conjunctivitis are self-limiting and no treatment is necessary in uncomplicated cases. However, conjunctivitis caused by gonorrhea or chlamydia and conjunctivitis in contact lens wearers should be treated with antibiotics. Treatment for viral conjunctivitis is supportive. Treatment with antihistamines and mast cell stabilizers alleviates the symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis.

Challenges of Acute Infectious Conjunctivitis Management and Diagnosis

Eye care professionals tend to evaluate acute infectious conjunctivitis cases at secondary care visits. Patients with infectious conjunctivitis are suboptimally managed in primary care due to an underappreciation of the prevalence of viral conjunctivitis, as well as frequent antibiotic prescriptions (~80%) for infectious conjunctivitis, despite guidelines that discourage antibiotic use for minor self-limiting illnesses. Antibiotic prescription is a measure of presumed diagnosis of bacterial conjunctivitis, but the rate of clinical accuracy in diagnosing viral conjunctivitis may be < 50%. Observational evidence indicates that laboratory confirmation isolates bacterial pathogens in just 30–50% of suspected cases.

Misdiagnoses expose patients to unnecessary and ineffective antibiotic treatment. In the Antibiotic Resistance Monitoring in Ocular Microorganisms (ARMOR) surveillance study of 3237 ocular isolates collected from patients with bacterial eye infections (from 72 US centers from 2009 to 2013), nearly one-half had methicillin-resistant staphylococci. Although the contribution of topical antibiotics to antibiotic resistance is not easily confirmed, current resistance trends should be considered before treating common eye infections with antibiotics. Furthermore, prescribing antibiotics in cases of unconfirmed bacterial infection is not compliant with Antibiotic Stewardship initiatives, which are part of primary care and pediatric practice protocols. In addition to the risk of antibiotic resistance, misdiagnosis can result in recurrent cases of infectious conjunctivitis, particularly among pediatric patients, or in cases that progress to serious ocular and extra-ocular complications.

There are several challenges to accurately diagnosing acute infectious conjunctivitis. First, clinical ambiguity exists between the acute viral and bacterial as well as the allergic forms, which can confound diagnosis. Discrimination between viral or bacterial origins of infectious conjunctivitis based on historical, nonspecific, clinical signs and symptoms, such as type of discharge, is difficult and not supported by evidence-based diagnostic criteria. Routine bacteriologic examinations are neither typically performed nor practical in the management of clinically suspected acute bacterial conjunctivitis, except in neonates. Culturing should also be considered for immunocompromised patients or for patients with hyperacute cases of infectious conjunctivitis. The misdiagnosis of infectious conjunctivitis is compounded by the view that all cases should be treated with topical ophthalmic antibiotics, even though most are self-limiting. Social factors, such as school policies or pressure to reduce absence from work, may also influence general practitioners to prescribe topical antibiotics. Lastly, the level at which patients enter the health care system can impact the accuracy of the diagnosis.

### Conjunctivitis: diagnosis and management [^114ZswsT]. American Family Physician (2024). Medium credibility.

Conjunctivitis caused by viruses, bacteria, or allergies is one of the most common eye conditions in primary care. There is no single sign or symptom that accurately differentiates viral from bacterial conjunctivitis. A comprehensive history and physical examination can guide diagnosis. Viral and allergic conjunctivitis are more common in adults and typically present with watery discharge. Supportive care options for viral conjunctivitis include artificial tears, cold compresses, and antihistamine eye drops. Strict personal hygiene, including frequent handwashing, is essential to decrease the risk of transmission. Topical antihistamines with mast cell-stabilizing activity are the treatment of choice for allergic conjunctivitis. Bacterial conjunctivitis is more common in children and typically presents as mucopurulent discharge with the eyelids matted shut. Delayed antibiotic prescribing has been found to have similar symptom control as immediate prescribing. Ophthalmology referral is indicated for conjunctivitis in a neonate or patients with severe pain, decreased vision, recent ocular surgery, vesicular rash on the eyelids or nose, history of rheumatologic disease, or immunocompromised state.

Conjunctivitis, an inflammation or infection of the mucous membrane covering the anterior sclera and inside eyelid, has 2 infectious forms, viral and bacterial, as well as a noninfectious form induced by allergens. Acute conjunctivitis is a relatively common ailment, with an estimated incidence reported in primary care settings of approximately 1.5% to 2% in the developed world. Although viral and bacterial conjunctivitis present with differentiating characteristics (eTable 4 in the Supplement), some studies suggest that pathogenic ambiguity can lead to misdiagnoses in as high as half of all cases, meaning that many patients receive inappropriate treatment. However, the unnecessary provision of antibiotics to individuals with the viral rather than the bacterial form of conjunctivitis adds to the development of antimicrobial resistance from overprescription of antibiotics. In reality, most conjunctivitis cases are self-limiting within 1 to 2 weeks of presentation, with minimal risk of long-term vision loss, a spontaneous remission rate that has led to increasing encouragement of a "delayed prescription" or "delayed antibiotic" approach.

Because in our scenario the visual signs and symptoms for viral and bacterial conjunctivitis precluded the SPs from requesting treatment for themselves, the SPs requested treatment for a family member or partner. For case 2A, when symptoms indicate bacterial conjunctivitis, the ideal management specified in the guidelines is prescription of a topical ocular antibiotic or, for mild cases, antiseptic eye drops (Table 2). Ocular lubricants or saline solutions will not treat the infection, although they can relieve some discomfort. Case 2B describes the presentation of viral conjunctivitis for which antiviral drugs are not recommended; rather, treatment is symptomatic and includes saline solution or an ocular lubricant. Diagnostic ambiguity is present because of conspecific symptom overlap between viral conjunctivitis and the most common type of noninfectious conjunctivitis, allergic conjunctivitis, whose incidence is very high. In the empirical analysis, we controlled for the contradistinctive symptoms of itchy or burning eyes and/or a history of allergies by asking the SP (posing as a family member or partner) the following diagnostic questions: "Do they have any allergies?" (with an answer of "No") and "Do they have any other symptoms?" (with an answer of "Yes, they had a cold about a week ago") (eTable 4 in the Supplement).

### COVID-19 and the eye [^114ze9qd]. Clinics in Dermatology (2023). Medium credibility.

There is growing literature describing the ocular manifestations of COVID-19. We have assessed published reviews, cross-sectional analyses, and clinical reports to summarize the ocular manifestations of the disease and available vaccines, identify the potential role of ocular transmission, and offer basic clinical guidance to health care providers. Ultimately, self-limiting conjunctivitis and conjunctival hyperemia are the most frequently reported ocular findings; several rarer entities may warrant targeted topical therapies. COVID-19 vaccines have been infrequently associated with the development of rare but significant side effects that may warrant ophthalmologist referral as well as specific treatments. Despite the overall low risk of ocular transmission, eye protection is advisable for health care providers in high-risk scenarios. This review should help to guide the assessment of patients with eye complaints in the setting of COVID-19 to promote appropriate diagnosis, treatment, monitoring, and referral.

### Conjunctivitis: a systematic review of diagnosis and treatment [^1138Wf4y]. JAMA (2013). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on infectious conjunctivitis:

- **Definition**: Infectious conjunctivitis is the inflammation of the conjunctiva caused by bacterial, viral, or fungal pathogens.
- **Pathophysiology**: Viruses account for 80% of all cases of acute conjunctivitis, with most cases caused by adenoviruses. Other viral causes include HSV, VZV, EBV, influenza, enterovirus, and coxsackievirus. Bacterial conjunctivitis is commonly caused by S. aureus, S. pneumoniae, and H. influenzae. Ophthalmia neonatorum is typically caused by C. trachomatis or N. gonorrhoeae. Fungal conjunctivitis is rare and usually occurs in immunocompromised patients.
- **Epidemiology**: It is estimated that approximately 6 million cases of acute conjunctivitis occur annually in the US.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors include close contact with infected individuals, poor hand hygiene, use of contaminated contact lenses, and exposure to contaminated water.
- **Disease course**: Clinically, infectious conjunctivitis presents with redness, itching, tearing, discharge, and crusting. Bacterial conjunctivitis often presents with purulent discharge, while viral conjunctivitis usually has a watery discharge and may be associated with upper respiratory tract infection symptoms. Fungal conjunctivitis may present with chronic, indolent symptoms.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Most cases of infectious conjunctivitis are self-limiting, lasting 1–2 weeks. Mild bacterial conjunctivitis typically resolves spontaneously without specific treatment in immunocompetent adults.

### A review of the differential diagnosis of acute infectious conjunctivitis: implications for treatment and management [^114DrM7v]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2020). Medium credibility.

Guidelines and criteria for diagnosing and treating acute infectious conjunctivitis based on natural history and etiology are available. However, greater awareness of and adherence to differential diagnosis should be kept in mind to improve outcomes in patients presenting with suspected acute infectious conjunctivitis.

Epidemiology and Clinical Presentation

Discriminating features of viral, bacterial, and allergic acute conjunctivitis are summarized in Table 1.

Table 1
Discriminating Clinical Features of Suspected Acute Conjunctivitis

Viral Conjunctivitis

Adenoviruses are the cause of most (65–90%) cases of viral conjunctivitis, while the herpes simplex virus (HSV) is the cause of 1.3–4.8% of all cases of acute conjunctivitis. Other viruses that are associated with conjunctivitis include varicella (herpes) zoster virus (VZV) and Molluscum contagiosum.

Adenoviruses are nonenveloped viruses that are relatively resistant to disinfection. Adenoviral conjunctivitis is highly contagious, due in part to the capacity of the virus to survive in a desiccated state at room temperature for several weeks. Transmission risk is 10–50%, and the infection may spread via personal contact or indirectly through shared items. Adenoviral conjunctivitis is self-limiting, with improvement of signs and symptoms within 5–14 days. Often, the condition presents as unilateral in early phases and eventually spreads to both eyes.

Adenovirus serotypes are associated with different types of ocular infection, including pharyngoconjunctival fever and epidemic keratoconjunctivitis (EKC; patient photos shown in Figure 1). Pharyngoconjunctivitis typically manifests bilaterally with fever and enlargement of the periauricular lymph nodes.EKC is more severe because of the adverse effect it can have on visual acuity; it is characterized by watery discharge, swelling, and redness, and involvement of lymph nodes on both sides of the neck.EKC is highly contagious, and asymptomatic patients who have contracted the disease may unknowingly spread the virus.

### Use of topical steroids in conjunctivitis: a review of the evidence [^117JkdqQ]. Cornea (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Conjunctivitis, or inflammation of the conjunctiva, is a common condition that can be caused by infectious (eg, bacterial or viral infections) and noninfectious (eg, allergy) etiologies. Treatment involves diagnosis of the underlying cause and use of appropriate therapies. A broad-spectrum therapy that can address multiple etiologies, and also the accompanying inflammation, would be very useful. In this review, we discuss the usefulness of topical ophthalmic corticosteroids and ophthalmic formulations that combine corticosteroids with anti-infectives/antibiotics for treating acute infectious conjunctivitis.

Methods

A review of the published literature and relevant treatment guidelines.

Results

Topical corticosteroids are useful in treating ocular inflammation, but most treatment guidelines recommend steroid use generally in severe cases of conjunctivitis. This is partly due to risks associated with steroid use. These risks include potential for prolonging adenoviral infections and potentiating/worsening herpes simplex virus infections, increased intraocular pressure, glaucoma, and cataracts. Most of these perceived risks are not, however, supported by high-quality clinical data. They are also associated with long-term steroid uses that are dissimilar to applications for infectious conjunctivitis. Clinical data show that ophthalmic formulations that combine corticosteroids with broad-spectrum anti-infectives could be effective and well tolerated when used for short-term treatment (≤ 2 weeks).

Conclusions

Corticosteroids, in combination with anti-infectives, could be a promising treatment option for acute conjunctivitis subject to development of further evidence on their effectiveness and safety in conjunctivitis treatment.

Adenoviral conjunctivitis — The majority of adult acute infectious conjunctivitis cases are viral and self-limited and do not require antimicrobial treatment. Patients with adenoviral conjunctivitis need to understand that the condition is highly contagious and that the virus can survive for many weeks on surfaces if careful disinfection doesn't occur; this infection is often referred to as epidemic keratoconjunctivitis (EKC). Patients should be educated about measures to reduce spread and encouraged to make every attempt to minimize contact with other people for 10 to 14 days from the onset of symptoms in the last eye affected.

### Conjunctivitis preferred practice pattern [^117Pgase]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Diagnostic tests for conjunctivitis are selectively used; some cases can be diagnosed on the basis of history and examination, but in other cases additional diagnostic tests may be helpful. Cultures for routine conjunctivitis in the absence of listed risk factors are rarely cost-effective or helpful in deciding on the treatment course, and cultures of the conjunctiva are indicated in all cases of suspected infectious neonatal conjunctivitis. Bacterial cultures and antibiotic susceptibility testing may be helpful for recurrent, severe, or chronic purulent conjunctivitis in any age group and in cases where the conjunctivitis has not responded to medication. Viral diagnostic tests are not routinely used in practice to establish the diagnosis of adenovirus, but they may prevent misdiagnosis, disease spread, unnecessary antibiotic use, increased health care costs, and lost productivity.

### Case for conservative management of adenoviral pseudomembranous conjunctivitis [^1178bBFA]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). High credibility.

The clinical course of adenoviral pseudomembranous conjunctivitis is mostly self-limiting and requires only supportive management measures; however, a minority of patients may develop severe inflammation in response to the virus, which can present as subepithelial infiltrates and pseudomembranes. In its most severe form, symblepharon can result from the inflammatory response resulting in longer-term clinical sequelae. The optimal management of adenoviral pseudomembranous conjunctivitis is poorly defined and while debridement is commonly recommended, there is limited evidence base to support this practice. In this paper, we present two cases of PCR-proven adenoviral pseudomembranous conjunctivitis managed conservatively with topical lubricants and corticosteroids rather than debridement to good effect.

### Effect of topical antibiotics on duration of acute infective conjunctivitis in children: a randomized clinical trial and a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113brFQi]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

The Cochrane collaboration conducted a systematic review and meta-analysisof the management of acute infective conjunctivitis in 2012 that led the authors to conclude that topical antibiotics can be of benefit for the treatment of conjunctivitis in that they improved the clinical cure rates both on days 2 to 5 and on days 6 to 10. That meta-analysis, however, included both adults and children, so that the results cannot be directly generalized to pediatric populations. To our knowledge, the present meta-analysis is the first to date to be based on data from pediatric patient populations alone.

Previous research into the etiology of acute infective conjunctivitis in children has found that approximately 80% of cases are caused by pathogenic bacteria. Accordingly, more than 80% of the children in this RCT had a positive bacterial conjunctival culture. Although most of the present children with acute infective conjunctivitis presented with respiratory tract symptoms, respiratory viruses were only detected in the conjunctivae of 12%, which is in accordance with previous observations.

The strengths of this trial include a randomized, placebo-controlled study design with the inclusion of a control group receiving no treatment, which mimics a clinical situation. We then conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of all RCTs we could find that were carried out with pediatric patient populations, including the RCT presented here. The results are directly applicable to primary care settings.

Limitations

This study has limitations. We were not able to compare topical antibiotic therapy with no intervention in the meta-analysis because the present RCT was, to our knowledge, the only trial that had included a control group without an intervention. Moreover, the placebo solutions used in the 4 trials included in the meta-analysis varied, so that we could not assess possible differences between them. Furthermore, we could not compare the efficacy of topical antibiotic therapy separately in children with bacterial and viral conjunctivitis.

### A randomized controlled trial of povidone-iodine / dexamethasone ophthalmic suspension for acute viral conjunctivitis [^1152n9Bk]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Infectious conjunctivitis is a common eye condition mainly caused by viruses and bacteria. Adenovirus is a frequent cause of infectious conjunctivitis, with reported rates of adenoviral conjunctivitis varying widely from 40% to 75% of all cases of infectious conjunctivitis.–Adenoviral conjunctivitis is a public health concern due to its highly contagious nature. It is also associated with significant patient discomfort, lost productivity, and in rare cases can lead to complications such as subepithelial corneal infiltrates and permanent compromise of vision.

Currently, there are no approved treatments for adenoviral conjunctivitis, with therapeutic options being limited to supportive therapies and palliative measures. A novel ophthalmic suspension of povidone-iodine (PVP-I) 0.6% and dexamethasone (DEX) 0.1% is currently under clinical investigation. PVP-I is an antiseptic with bactericidal, virucidal, and fungicidal properties.DEX is a corticosteroid routinely used as a topical ophthalmic suspension for the treatment of ocular inflammation. Both components are approved for use in other indications and have been shown to be safe and efficacious for use on the ocular surface in humans.–

Different ophthalmic formulations of PVP-I in combination with DEX have been investigated for the treatment of conjunctivitis in early-stage studies. In an in vivo study conducted in rabbits, PVP-I 0.4%/DEX 0.1% significantly improved clinical scores and viral titers vs control treatments. In a randomized controlled trial of 122 patients with presumed viral conjunctivitis, treatment with ophthalmic PVP-I 0.4%/DEX 0.1% four times daily (QID) significantly reduced the duration of conjunctivitis vs patients treated with artificial tears. Similar results were obtained in a randomized controlled trial of 74 patients with adenoviral keratoconjunctivitis confirmed with polymerase chain reaction (PCR). In that study, significantly faster improvement of clinical signs and adenoviral eradication (in 5–7 days) vs the control groups were observed in patients treated with PVP-I 1.0%/DEX 0.1%. In a recent Phase II randomized controlled study of 176 patients with acute adenoviral conjunctivitis, ophthalmic administration of PVP-I 0.6%/DEX 0.1% for 5 days demonstrated statistical superiority to vehicle for clinical resolution, adenoviral eradication, global clinical score, and expanded clinical cure.

### Conjunctivitis preferred practice pattern [^1179x62B]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Adenoviral conjunctivitis — therapy and monitoring — There is no proven effective treatment for eradication of adenovirus infection; however, artificial tears, topical antihistamines, topical steroids, oral analgesics, or cold compresses may be used to mitigate symptoms, and the use of antibiotics in this viral infection should be avoided because of potential adverse treatment effects. Topical corticosteroids are helpful to reduce symptoms and may reduce scarring in severe cases, with close follow-up warranted for patients treated with corticosteroids; in an animal model, administration of topical corticosteroids led to prolonged viral shedding, and it is not known whether this is the case in humans. Because of its broad antimicrobial spectrum, povidone-iodine has been investigated as a treatment consideration. Off-label use of topical ganciclovir 0.15% ophthalmic gel has been investigated for the treatment of epidemic keratoconjunctivitis (EKC) and has shown potential benefit specific against adenovirus serotypes, but further efficacy on a larger scale needs to be demonstrated before definitive recommendations can be made. For patients with membranous conjunctivitis, debridement of the membrane can be considered to prevent corneal epithelial abrasions or permanent cicatricial changes.

### Summary benchmarks-full set – 2024 [^116UHwaU]. AAO (2024). High credibility.

Conjunctivitis management — care management emphasizes that the majority of cases in the adult population are viral and self-limited and do not require antimicrobial treatment, and there is no proven effective treatment for eradication of adenoviral infection; symptomatic measures such as artificial tears, topical antihistamines, topical corticosteroids, oral analgesics or cold compresses may mitigate symptoms, and the use of antibiotics should be avoided because of potential adverse treatment effects. Allergen-specific immunotherapy is beneficial in reducing allergic conjunctivitis, more so in children than in adults. Treatment for vernal conjunctivitis includes environmental modification with cold compresses and ocular lubricants, and for acute exacerbations, topical corticosteroids are usually needed to control severe symptoms (I+, MQ, SR). For contact lens-related keratoconjunctivitis, discontinue contact lens wear until the cornea returns to normal, and in mild cases a brief course of topical corticosteroids in addition to longer-term topical cyclosporine can be considered. Use systemic antibiotic treatment for conjunctivitis due to Neisseria gonorrhoeae or Chlamydia trachomatis; treat sexual partners when conjunctivitis is associated with sexually transmitted diseases and refer patients and their sexual partners to an appropriate medical specialist; refer patients with manifestation of a systemic disease to an appropriate medical specialist.

### Prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in conjunctival swab samples among patients presenting with conjunctivitis during the COVID-19 pandemic [^113Yz3Pe]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2022). Medium credibility.

In our study cohort, 89% of patients presented with acute follicular conjunctivitis, usually suggesting a viral etiology. A majority of acute conjunctivitis patients usually present to primary care and urgent care. Since we conducted this study at a tertiary center, we postulated that the timing of the swab may have played a role in the lower rates of confirmed adenoviral conjunctivitis within our sample. By the time conjunctival swabs were collected, patients may have already been in the later stages of viral conjunctivitis, and swabs may have yielded a negative result because of this. Even though we avoided using preservative containing topical anesthetic drops before collecting samples, some patients reported using topical eye drops in the preceding days of the study visit. It is not clear whether these eye drops had an antiviral activity which may have been the reason for the zero-occurrence rate of SARS-CoV-2 associated conjunctivitis. Additionally, the sensitivity and specificity of RT-PCR for diagnosing SARS-CoV infection are 85–87% and 100%, respectively. Thus, there may have been false-negative cases within our sample.

Is it important to know whether SARS-CoV-2 is a common reason for conjunctivitis during the pandemic? Treatment for conjunctivitis would not differ based on the viral etiology since there is no FDA-approved treatment for any viral conjunctivitis. However, it is crucial to identify the viral etiology to prevent its spread as both SARS-CoV-2 and adenovirus are very contagious and can cause respiratory disease. In a recent editorial on ocular surface and COVID-19, eye protection was explicitly recommended for health care workers and patients at risk, even though there is a low risk of SARS-CoV-2 spreading through tears. Currently, there is a lack of universally agreed recommendations to protect health care workers, specifically eye care providers, and allied ophthalmic personnel. Although ruling out common viral etiologies and testing patients for SARS-CoV-2 in ocular samples were recommended for early detection of subclinical COVID-19 cases to limit further spread, our data do not suggest that precautions to prevent viral spread when viral conjunctivitis is suspected should be different from what it was before the COVID-19 pandemic. We also suggest that it is probably not valuable to perform routine testing for SARS-CoV-2 in every patient presenting only with conjunctivitis.

### A randomized controlled trial of povidone-iodine / dexamethasone ophthalmic suspension for acute viral conjunctivitis [^115xMigS]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To evaluate the clinical safety and efficacy of povidone-iodine (PVP-I) 0.6%/dexamethasone (DEX) 0.1% ophthalmic suspension vs vehicle in patients with clinically suspected acute viral conjunctivitis.

Patients and methods

This was a randomized, double-masked, parallel-group, vehicle-controlled study. Adults with a clinical diagnosis of suspected acute viral conjunctivitis were randomized 1:1 to PVP-I/DEX ophthalmic suspension or vehicle bilaterally four times daily for 5 days (Days 1–5). Evaluation was on Days 1, 3 (+1-day window), and 6 (+1). Patients with signs of acute viral conjunctivitis at the Day 6 visit received open-label PVP-I/DEX for five additional days and were evaluated on Day 11–14. The primary efficacy endpoint was clinical resolution of acute viral conjunctivitis in the study eye at the Day 6 visit.

Results

Overall, 132 patients were randomized and received treatment (PVP-I/DEX, n = 66; vehicle, n = 66); 38 patients continued into the open-label portion of the study. Not enough patients with confirmed adenoviral conjunctivitis (n = 32/132) were enrolled to assess the primary endpoint, although there were some efficacy trends in the PVP-I/DEX group for global clinical score (sum of watery conjunctival discharge and bulbar conjunctival redness). There were no serious treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and no patients discontinued due to a TEAE. In the masked phase, 56.1% of patients receiving PVP-I/DEX experienced at least one TEAE vs 43.9% in the vehicle group; 78.9% of patients in the open-label phase experienced at least one TEAE. Most TEAEs were mild in severity.

Conclusion

PVP-I/DEX ophthalmic suspension administered for ≤ 14 days had a favorable safety profile and was generally well tolerated.

### Does this patient with acute infectious conjunctivitis have a bacterial infection? the rational clinical examination systematic review [^112ByJSW]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Acute infectious conjunctivitis is characterized by ocular redness and discharge, and is a common clinical entity. Evidence-based tools to aid the clinical diagnosis of viral vs bacterial conjunctivitis are lacking and may contribute to overprescribing of topical antibiotics.

Objective

To determine the relative prevalence of viral vs bacterial conjunctivitis in adults and children, and to determine which symptoms or signs are suggestive of a viral vs bacterial etiology.

Data Sources

A MEDLINE search (January 1946-March 2022) yielded 1891 articles. Included articles were rated using a quality score based on a modified Rational Clinical Examination grading system. Methodological quality levels 1 through 4 required a microbiological reference standard for diagnosis, whereas quality level 5 (the lowest quality) used a clinical reference standard for diagnosis.

Study Selection

Consecutive series of patients presenting with acute infectious conjunctivitis and case series of viral or bacterial conjunctivitis alone. Thirty-two studies were included in a meta-analysis to determine prevalence and diagnostic accuracy measures; 27 used a microbiological reference standard for diagnosis and 5 used a clinical reference standard for diagnosis.

Results

In studies involving children (5 studies; 881 patients; mean age, 4.7 years [age range, 1 month-18 years]), the prevalence of bacterial conjunctivitis was higher than viral conjunctivitis (71% vs 16%, respectively, P = 0.01). In the only study of adults (n = 207 patients; mean age, 25.7 years), the prevalence of viral conjunctivitis was higher than bacterial conjunctivitis (78% vs 16%, respectively, P < .001). For the primary analysis of level 1 (n = 6) and level 2 (n = 5) studies (1725 patients total), the clinical findings that best distinguished a viral etiology for conjunctivitis from a bacterial etiology included pharyngitis (sensitivity range, 0.55–0.58; specificity range, 0.89–0.94; positive likelihood ratio [LR] range, 5.4–9.9), preauricular lymphadenopathy (sensitivity range, 0.17–0.31; specificity range, 0.93–0.94; positive LR range, 2.5–5.6), and contact with another person with red eye (sensitivity, 0.18 [95% CI, 0.14–0.22]; specificity, 0.93 [95% CI, 0.90–0.95]; positive LR, 2.5 [95% CI, 1.6–3.7]). Mucopurulent ocular discharge (sensitivity, 0.76 [95% CI, 0.60–0.87); specificity, 0.66 [95% CI, 0.58–0.73]; positive LR, 2.1 [95% CI, 1.7–2.6]) and otitis media (sensitivity, 0.24 [95% CI, 0.20–0.29]; specificity, 0.91 [95% CI, 0.85–0.94]; positive LR, 2.5 [95% CI, 1.5–4.4]) were associated with the presence of bacterial conjunctivitis.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this review, bacterial conjunctivitis was more common than viral conjunctivitis in children and viral conjunctivitis was more common than bacterial conjunctivitis in adults, although the prevalence estimates were based on limited evidence. Symptoms and signs associated with a higher likelihood of viral conjunctivitis in adults and children included concomitant pharyngitis, an enlarged preauricular node, and contact with another person with red eye, and signs associated with a higher likelihood of bacterial conjunctivitis included the presence of mucopurulent discharge and otitis media, but no single symptom or sign differentiated the 2 conditions with high certainty.

One in eight schoolchildren have an episode of acute infective conjunctivitis every year. Standard clinical practice is to prescribe a topical antibiotic, although the evidence to support this practice is scarce. We undertook a randomised double-blind trial to compare the effectiveness of chloramphenicol eye drops with placebo in children with infective conjunctivitis in primary care.

Methods

Our study included 326 children aged 6 months to 12 years with a clinical diagnosis of conjunctivitis who were recruited from 12 general medical practices in the UK. We assigned 163 children to receive chloramphenicol eye drops and 163 to receive placebo eye drops. Eye swabs were taken for bacterial and viral analysis. The primary outcome was clinical cure at day 7, which was assessed from diaries completed by parents. All children were followed up for 6 weeks to identify relapse. Survival statistics were used for comparison, and analysis was by intention to treat.

Findings

Nine children were lost to follow-up (one in chloramphenicol group; eight in placebo group). Clinical cure by day 7 occurred in 128 (83%) of 155 children with placebo compared with 140 (86%) of 162 with chloramphenicol (risk difference 3.8%, 95% CI -4.1% to 11.8%). Seven (4%) children with chloramphenicol and five (3%) with placebo had further conjunctivitis episodes within 6 weeks (1.2%, -2.9% to 5.3%). Adverse events were rare and evenly distributed between each group.

Interpretation

Most children presenting with acute infective conjunctivitis in primary care will get better by themselves and do not need treatment with an antibiotic.

### A randomized controlled trial of povidone-iodine / dexamethasone ophthalmic suspension for acute viral conjunctivitis [^117NE1xD]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To evaluate the clinical safety and efficacy of povidone-iodine (PVP-I) 0.6%/dexamethasone (DEX) 0.1% ophthalmic suspension vs vehicle in patients with clinically suspected acute viral conjunctivitis.

Patients and Methods

This was a randomized, double-masked, parallel-group, vehicle-controlled study. Adults with a clinical diagnosis of suspected acute viral conjunctivitis were randomized 1:1 to PVP-I/DEX ophthalmic suspension or vehicle bilaterally four times daily for 5 days (Days 1–5). Evaluation was on Days 1, 3 (+1-day window), and 6 (+1). Patients with signs of acute viral conjunctivitis at the Day 6 visit received open-label PVP-I/DEX for five additional days and were evaluated on Day 11–14. The primary efficacy endpoint was clinical resolution of acute viral conjunctivitis in the study eye at the Day 6 visit.

Results

Overall, 132 patients were randomized and received treatment (PVP-I/DEX, n = 66; vehicle, n = 66); 38 patients continued into the open-label portion of the study. Not enough patients with confirmed adenoviral conjunctivitis (n = 32/132) were enrolled to assess the primary endpoint, although there were some efficacy trends in the PVP-I/DEX group for global clinical score (sum of watery conjunctival discharge and bulbar conjunctival redness). There were no serious treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and no patients discontinued due to a TEAE. In the masked phase, 56.1% of patients receiving PVP-I/DEX experienced at least one TEAE vs 43.9% in the vehicle group; 78.9% of patients in the open-label phase experienced at least one TEAE. Most TEAEs were mild in severity.

Conclusion

PVP-I/DEX ophthalmic suspension administered for ≤ 14 days had a favorable safety profile and was generally well tolerated.

### Conjunctivitis preferred practice pattern [^1158fAMP]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Molluscum contagiosum — ocular surface disease: Conjunctivitis and keratitis from molluscum contagiosum are due to viral shedding from the eyelid lesion(s) onto the surface of the eye. Molluscum lesions may spontaneously resolve, but they can also persist for months to years. Treatment to remove the lesions is indicated in symptomatic patients, with options including incision and curettage (aggressive enough to cause bleeding), simple excision, excision and cautery, and cryotherapy. In patients with multiple lesions, care should be taken to identify and treat nascent lesions in order to reduce the risk of recurrence, but reduction of the viral load often allows the host immunologic response to eliminate residual virus. The conjunctivitis may require weeks to resolve after elimination of the lesion. In adults, large and multiple molluscum lesions with relatively little conjunctival inflammation may indicate an immunocompromised state. Follow-up is not usually necessary unless the conjunctivitis persists, and referral to a dermatologist may be necessary for examination of other suspicious lesions.

### A randomised placebo-controlled trial of topical steroid in presumed viral conjunctivitis [^111T98Mw]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2011). Low credibility.

Aims

To assess whether topical steroids improve patient comfort compared with hypromellose in acute presumed viral conjunctivitis.

Methods

Patients presenting with acute follicular conjunctivitis, presumed viral in origin, were randomised to receive either dexamethasone 0.1% or hypromellose 0.3% drops four times daily for 1 week. At review after 5–7 days patients completed questionnaires on whether they thought the treatment had helped and on their level of discomfort. A physician assessed conjunctival hyperaemia using a grading scale.

Results

111 patients were randomised: 56 received dexamethasone drops and 55 received hypromellose lubricant drops. Eighty-eight returned for review. Most patients (39/45 (87%)) receiving dexamethasone and most of those receiving hypromellose 30/43 (70%) felt that the treatment helped. Analysis of all responses showed a significant difference between treatments (p = 0.0248, rank sum test). No significant differences between dexamethasone and hypromellose arms were found in the patients' perceived level of discomfort or the physician grading of conjunctival hyperaemia. No patient experienced a serious complication.

Conclusions

There us now evidence to support the use of a short course of topical dexamethasone for patients presenting with acute follicular conjunctivitis presumed to be viral in origin. Where topical dexamethasone is prescribed we have not found it to be harmful.

### Direct and indirect costs of infectious conjunctivitis in a commercially insured population in the United States [^112R7n8i]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Conjunctivitis is a common condition that affects more than 6 million people in the United States annually. The majority of cases are infectious, most commonly caused by viruses and bacteria. Between 2006 and 2011, 4 million (28%) ocular-related emergency department (ED) visits were attributed to conjunctivitis, making it the most common ocular diagnosis presenting in the ED. Although most viral and bacterial cases are self-limiting, the condition can be associated with persistent signs and symptoms. For example, in a retrospective observational case series of 54 patients with adenoviral keratoconjunctivitis in a tertiary care facility, the median disease duration was 5 weeks, but the mean was 23.4 weeks, indicating a protracted clinical course among a subset of patients. Approximately 26% of patients exhibited symptomatic subepithelial corneal infiltrates for over 45 days after their first conjunctivitis examination.

The direct cost of conjunctivitis has been estimated to be approximately $800 million annually in the United States. Indirectly, the condition can also affect family members ("caregivers") who may miss work to care for patients, especially school-aged patients, contributing to employee absenteeism. In a study designed to estimate the direct and indirect annual costs of bacterial conjunctivitis treatment in the United States, the indirect cost of bacterial conjunctivitis alone ranged from approximately $63 million to $141 million. Assuming that the indirect costs of viral conjunctivitis are similar, this suggests that direct and indirect costs of viral and bacterial conjunctivitis could exceed $1 billion annually.

Infectious conjunctivitis is thought to be highly contagious, with numerous reports of conjunctivitis outbreaks in child care centers, schools, health care centers, etc. Transmission through direct contact is generally believed to be the most common cause, particularly among children. Although the available literature provides robust estimates of the direct and indirect costs of infectious conjunctivitis, to our knowledge, no study exists that assesses and incorporates costs associated with transmission from one family member to another, nor does any study exist that has directly calculated both health care resource utilization (HRU) and direct and indirect costs due to infectious conjunctivitis.

Recognizing that infectious conjunctivitis places a burden on the family unit, we undertook a comprehensive assessment of the direct and indirect costs of infectious conjunctivitis on affected patients and their family members in a real-world setting.

### Cornea / external disease summary benchmarks – 2024 [^115scch9]. AAO (2024). High credibility.

Conjunctivitis — care management outlines symptomatic care for viral disease, targeted therapy for allergic and vernal forms, measures for contact lens–related keratoconjunctivitis, and management when sexually transmitted pathogens are involved. The majority of cases in the adult population are viral and self-limited, and do not require antimicrobial treatment; there is no proven effective treatment for eradication of adenoviral infection, artificial tears, topical antihistamines, topical corticosteroids, oral analgesics or cold compresses may mitigate symptoms, and the use of antibiotics should be avoided because of potential adverse treatment effects. Allergen-specific immunotherapy is beneficial in reducing allergic conjunctivitis, more so in children than in adults. Treat mild allergic conjunctivitis with an over-the-counter antihistamine/vasoconstrictor agent or second-generation topical histamine H1-receptor antagonists; if the condition is frequently recurrent or persistent, mast-cell stabilizers can be used, and new medications combine antihistamine activity with mast-cell stabilizing properties. Treatment for vernal conjunctivitis includes modifying the environment and use of cold compresses and ocular lubricants, and for acute exacerbations, topical corticosteroids are usually needed to control severe symptoms (I+, MQ, SR). For contact lens-related keratoconjunctivitis, discontinue contact lens wear until the cornea returns to normal, and in mild cases a brief course of topical corticosteroids, in addition to longer-term use of topical cyclosporine, can be considered. Use systemic antibiotic treatment for conjunctivitis due to Neisseria gonorrhoeae or Chlamydia trachomatis, treat sexual partners when conjunctivitis is associated with sexually transmitted diseases and refer patients and their sexual partners to an appropriate medical specialist, and refer patients with manifestation of a systemic disease to an appropriate medical specialist.

### Conjunctivitis preferred practice pattern [^112Etouf]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Conjunctivitis Preferred Practice Pattern — Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‑CoV‑2)/Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‑19) conjunctivitis more often presents with unilateral than bilateral conjunctival injection, with a typical follicular reaction that may include chemosis, watery discharge, superficial keratitis, and pseudomembranes. Associated factors include SARS‑CoV‑2 exposure, unprotected eye exposure, significant travel history, or respiratory symptoms. The natural history is that it usually occurs early in disease with mild inflammation and disappearance of symptoms within a few days of treatment, has relatively low incidence/prevalence compared with other systemic manifestations and is more common in children, and may be isolated or associated with systemic symptoms. Potential sequelae are that conjunctival symptoms appear self‑limited with variable duration (5–21 days), and typically there is no effect on visual acuity and no short‑term complications.

### A review of the differential diagnosis of acute infectious conjunctivitis: implications for treatment and management [^115HvnCi]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2020). Medium credibility.

Clinical Examination

Some initial diagnosis is necessary to exclude any potentially serious cause of acute red eye. Historical features for evaluation include pain or photophobia, which can be signs of bacterial keratitis, anterior uveitis, or acute angle-closure glaucoma. Associated symptoms such as upper respiratory tract infection, or known exposure to others who have presented with this, suggest a viral form of conjunctivitis. Patient history of ocular trauma should be considered as a potential alternative cause of inflammation. A corneal abrasion resulting from a foreign body or exposure to the sun or ultraviolet light can present as red eye. Red, painful and watery eyes due to corneal or conjunctival foreign bodies can masquerade as acute and chronic forms of conjunctivitis. Presence of a foreign body is elucidated via history, and by careful biomicroscopic exam. In those who wear contact lenses, the risk of corneal involvement and bacterial keratitis is high; therefore, these individuals should be referred to an eye care provider. Some signs and symptoms of acute infectious conjunctivitis are mimicked by dry eye disease such as hyperemia, grittiness and stinging. Adhering to the triage questions and risk factor analysis recommended by the Tear Film & Ocular Surface Society Dry Eye Workshop II (TFOS DEWS II)aids the exclusion of dry eye disease, although it may coexist with acute infectious conjunctivitis owing to the high prevalence of both conditions. Of the immune-mediated forms of conjunctivitis (eg, ocular mucous membrane pemphigoid, graft-versus-host disease, Stevens-Johnson syndrome), generally early and milder manifestations of immune-mediated conjunctivopathy may share symptomatology with acute infectious conjunctivitis because of the presence of nonspecific complaints (eg, redness, tearing, clear discharge) and conjunctival injection. However, these types of conjunctivitis often differ from viral conjunctivitis in their time course; they are generally protracted and more easily confused with a chronic process rather than an acute episode.

### Pharmacist compliance with therapeutic guidelines on diagnosis and treatment provision [^112CeZam]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Scenario 2: Infective Conjunctivitis

For this clinical presentation, although antibiotics and antibacterials are interchangeable as appropriate treatments in case 2A (bacterial conjunctivitis; n = 81), antihistamines and/or decongestants are inappropriate in case 2B (viral conjunctivitis; n = 73). We can thus determine the type of conjunctivitis diagnosed based on the clinical applications of the products supplied. Overtreatment occurred in 55 of 154 cases (35.7%). For scenario 2, the SPs recorded 154 observations, 7 of them resulting in no sale (Figure 1). In 10 interactions, the pharmacy staff recommended more than 1 treatment; for example, 1 sale in case 2A included both the eye drops and eye ointment of the same antibiotic product. Moreover, even though 67 of the interactions (82.7%) in case 2A were compliant with therapeutic guidelines, this rate decreased to 28.8% (n = 21) in case 2B. The potential diagnostic complexities for pharmacists are underscored by the overtreatment rate, which was statistically significant between cases 2A (6 of 81 [7.4%]) and 2B (49 of 73 [67.1%]) (based on a 2-sample, 2-tailed test of proportions; P < .001). Likewise, the differences between the 2 scenarios clearly indicated that the condition's differential aspects are embedded in the interaction.

For case 2B, the pharmacist must differentiate between the highly similar presentations of viral conjunctivitis and allergic conjunctivitis, making 2 questions integral to the diagnosis: "Do they have any allergies?" and "Do they have any other medical conditions?" The answers supplied by the SPs (no history of allergies and the patient having had influenza "about 2 weeks ago") point to a high probability of viral conjunctivitis. However, in the cases of compliant behavior recorded (n = 31) for case 2B, only 2 interactions included both these questions, and only 4 included 1 of the questions. Assumedly, in this scenario, the similarity of viral conjunctivitis to other topical types, particularly the highly prevalent allergic conjunctivitis, led pharmacists and pharmacist assistants to recommend antihistamines as the primary treatment in 33 of the 70 interactions (47.1%) involving a sale. However, of the 49 interactions that led to overtreatment, 33 (67.3%) included at least 1 of the critical diagnostic questions compared with only 6 (28.6%) among the 21 compliant interactions.

### A review of the differential diagnosis of acute infectious conjunctivitis: implications for treatment and management [^111FXY4F]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2020). Medium credibility.

Prior HSV infection is a predisposing factor for HSV conjunctivitis, and reactivation may be triggered by stress, trauma, ultraviolet light exposure, or other viral illnesses.HSV conjunctivitis is usually unilateral and characterized by bulbar conjunctival injection, thin and watery discharge, and mild follicular reaction of conjunctiva. Distinctive signs are vesicular eyelid lesions and pleomorphic or dendritic epithelial keratitis on the cornea or conjunctiva. As these signs on the cornea or conjunctiva are often present in the absence of eyelid or dermal lesions, they are best seen by instillation of vital dyes such as sodium fluorescein, lissamine green, or rose Bengal to assess the ocular surface. HSV conjunctivitis usually subsides within 4–7 days unless complications occur. Topical and/or oral antivirals are recommended to shorten the duration of illness. Because topical corticosteroids can potentiate HSV, they should be avoided, particularly in the presence of corneal or conjunctival epithelial disease.HSV can also cause EKC, which is difficult to distinguish clinically from adenoviral conjunctivitis.

Active chicken pox and prior exposure to chicken pox or shingles are predisposing factors for VZV conjunctivitis. This condition is commonly unilateral in presentation. Distinctive signs of VZV conjunctivitis include inflammation of the eyelids, conjunctiva, cornea, or uvea. Uveitis may present with increased intraocular pressure, which in some cases may rise to dangerous levels.VZV conjunctivitis usually abates in a few days. A combination of oral antivirals and topical corticosteroids can be used with caution to manage VZV conjunctivitis, as topical antivirals alone are not effective in treating VZV conjunctivitis.

b Specific viral etiology not known

None of the conjunctivitis events were considered related to the study drug, and all events were mild or moderate in severity; all were resolved during the treatment period (ESM 2 – Table S6). No event was an SAE, and no patients temporarily or permanently discontinued study treatment because of conjunctivitis. There were too few events to calculate a median time to the first conjunctivitis event. Hazard ratios did not show any differences between dupilumab and placebo in adolescents or adults (ESM 2 — Table S5). Treatments for conjunctivitis included a systemic antihistamine (loratadine) and oxymetazoline hydrochloride.

### Pediatricians' knowledge, attitude and practice on treating children with red eye disease [^1148UNRj]. BMC Ophthalmology (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusions and suggestions

The research findings indicate a moderate level of knowledge among pediatricians, where the issue of treatment is slightly weaker than that of diagnosis. The problem involving lack of knowledge was more conspicuous among the more experienced pediatricians. It appears that knowledge is critical both for readiness to treat red eye and for providing proper treatment.

However, it is clear from our results that more education in this area, particularly in the case of older pediatricians, is still necessary. Identification of dry eye as a common cause of red eye symptoms and more appropriate treatment of dry eye, allergic conjunctivitis, and viral conjunctivitis, are key messages that emerge from this study. Hence, it is necessary to verify that pediatricians receive appropriate tools for treating eye disorders in children and that their knowledge on red eye is refreshed, particularly in the case of more experienced pediatricians.

Diagnostic Tests

Viral diagnostic tests are not used routinely in a primary care setting, but access to these diagnostics has increased and may provide some guidance in obtaining a more accurate diagnosis. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for measurement of adenoviral DNA from tear fluid has become more common, but use of the technology is still hindered by costs of equipment and training. Viral cell culture with confirmatory immunofluorescence assay is time consuming and rarely performed.

The availability of an in-office rapid test, such as AdenoPlus (Quidel, San Diego, CA, USA), to detect adenoviruses is a promising approach to obtain a timely diagnosis and reduce unnecessary use of ophthalmic antibiotics. In addition to the health benefits, use of a rapid and accurate point-of-care test for adenovirus detection could reduce societal costs associated with acute conjunctivitis. AdenoPlus specifically detects adenoviral serotypes through antigen-based microfiltration sampling. Observed sensitivity of the test ranges from 39.5 to 93%. Sambursky et al noted that testing conditions may cause an artificial inflation of the sensitivity, and Holtz et al suggested verifying negative results by real-time PCR. Also, clinical judgement may supersede the result of this test vis-à-vis treatment, in part because no available ophthalmic agent is indicated for the treatment of viral conjunctivitis.

Conjunctival cultures should be obtained for all diagnoses of suspected infectious neonatal conjunctivitis. Bacterial cultures are recommended for patients of all ages if purulent infectious conjunctivitis recurs, is severe, or becomes chronic. In places where culture plating is less common, ESwab (Copan Diagnostics, Murrieta, CA, USA) offers a convenient method of sample preparation for bacterial testing.ESwab is a liquid-based multipurpose collection and transport system that is suitable for automation, Gram stains, and traditional culture. Also, the ESwab system maintains testing viability of bacteria at room temperature and for ≤ 48 hrs. Suspected cases of adult and neonatal chlamydial conjunctivitis can be confirmed by diagnostic testing using an immunofluorescent antibody test and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Testing ocular samples by PCR is not currently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. Gram or Giemsa staining of conjunctival cytology smears is recommended for diagnosing infectious neonatal conjunctivitis or gonococcal conjunctivitis in any age group. In cases of conjunctivitis unresponsive to therapy, conjunctival biopsy in conjunction with immunofluorescent staining can be considered.

### Conjunctivitis preferred practice pattern [^115oa6Gz]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Conjunctivitis PPP — herpes simplex virus (HSV) conjunctivitis is usually unilateral and can be bilateral, especially in atopic, pediatric, or immunocompromised patients, with bulbar conjunctival injection, watery discharge, mild follicular reaction of conjunctiva, and a palpable preauricular node; distinctive signs include vesicular rash or ulceration of eyelids, pleomorphic or excavated dendritic epithelial keratitis of cornea, and ulceration of the conjunctiva. Associated/predisposing factors include prior infection with HSV with triggers for reactivation such as stress, other acute viral or febrile illnesses, ultraviolet exposure, surgery, or trauma, and primary HSV infection with exposure to an infected individual. Natural history is that it usually subsides without treatment within 4 to 7 days unless complications occur. Potential sequelae include blepharitis, epithelial keratitis, corneal edema, endotheliitis, stromal keratitis, neovascularization, scarring, thinning, perforation, uveitis, trabeculitis, and retinitis.

### The epidemiology and treatment of conjunctivitis at urgent care centres in Israel [^115KBDLm]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2019). Medium credibility.

The majority of patients (82%) received a prescription for topical antibiotics. This finding is similar to previous studies. In the Netherlands, 80% of patients with conjunctivitis under the care of general practitioners received topical antibiotics. In a survey carried out in Great Britain, 95% of general care practitioners report prescribing topical antibiotics for conjunctivitis. A study in the USA found that 68% of patients diagnosed with conjunctivitis at UCC filled their prescription for topical antibiotics, although the actual prescription rate is likely to be higher.

The high rate of antibiotic prescription for conjunctivitis may suggest overuse, since most conjunctivitis is viral. However, in this study, 31% of the cohort presenting at UCC with conjunctivitis are younger than 6 years of age. Since bacterial pathogens are the most common cause of acute pediatric conjunctivitis, and 78% of these children had purulent ocular discharge, they are most likely to have suffered from bacterial conjunctivitis. While bacterial conjunctivitis will resolve by itself, antimicrobials can be prescribed to shorten the duration of illness. Furthermore, many child care providers exclude children with conjunctivitis until antibiotic treatment is provided and this has been shown to impact the decision to prescribe antibiotics. Moreover, it is difficult clinically to differentiate viral from bacterial conjunctivitis, so providers tend to "err on the side of safety" and prescribe antibiotics "just in case".

The high number of cases found in a desert condition is interesting. This may be due to the association between desert dust and conjunctivitis.

The finding that most of the patients did not have fever and when fever was present, it was usually in the presence of another condition, further emphasizes that conjunctivitis is not a systemic disease and does not need to be referred to ED.

The main limitation of the paper is that the medical records do not specifically distinguish between viral, bacterial and allergic conjunctivitis. This is likely to have led to the overuse of antibiotics, which can have negative consequences. However, it is difficult to clinically differentiate bacterial from viral conjunctivitis. For example, in Great Britain, only 36% of general care physicians believed that they could discriminate between bacterial and viral infection.

Another limitation is that patients were not followed-up after release from UCC. Patients who were sent home might not have improved and went to a primary care physician and/or ophthalmologist for further treatment. However, these patients are not adding to ED burden.

Assessments and Analysis

We summarized conjunctivitis events reported as adverse events (AEs) in the safety populations (i.e. patients who received one or more doses of the study drug) of these three clinical trials. Adverse events and serious AEs (SAEs) were reported by investigators and were detected through two channels: patients reporting symptoms to the investigator (either unprompted or in response to the query "did you have any problems?"); or identification of the AE and SAE by investigators following clinical examination during study visits. Conjunctivitis events were diagnosed and treated based on patient-reported symptoms and external eye examination by study investigators (most of whom were dermatologists; some were allergists; and none were ophthalmologists), in most cases without ophthalmologic referral. Events were coded according to Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities Preferred Terms (MedDRA PTs). Unless otherwise specified, the term "conjunctivitis" refers to a compiled group of MedDRA PTs that included the word "conjunctivitis", (i.e. conjunctivitis, allergic conjunctivitis, bacterial conjunctivitis, viral conjunctivitis, adenoviral conjunctivitis, and atopic keratoconjunctivitis). All assessments for the compiled conjunctivitis term included data for the compiled term and for the component PTs, unless indicated otherwise. The study protocols did not require any specific query about ocular symptoms, and most cases were not diagnosed by an ophthalmologist. In ADOL, association of dupilumab dose/concentration and risk of conjunctivitis was assessed.

### Conjunctivitis in dupilumab clinical trials [^112F6RVE]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

End points and assessments

Clinical trial investigators (mostly dermatologists or allergists) diagnosed and reported conjunctivitis AEs, which were subsequently coded using Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) preferred terms (PTs). Unless otherwise specified, the term 'conjunctivitis' refers to the group of PTs that included the term 'conjunctivitis', namely conjunctivitis, allergic conjunctivitis, bacterial conjunctivitis, viral conjunctivitis, adenoviral conjunctivitis and atopic keratoconjunctivitis. All cases of conjunctivitis were included regardless of aetiology (including blepharoconjunctivitis, which was coded as the MedDRA PT conjunctivitis; and excluding blepharitis in the absence of conjunctivitis).

The study protocols did not require any specific query about ocular symptoms. AEs were generally reported by patients spontaneously, in response to the query 'did you have any problems?', or by investigators on physical examination during clinical visits. Investigators who reported conjunctivitis of unspecified aetiology were asked for more details, and whether they could use a more specific PT. In most cases, the aetiology remained unspecified or was designated 'allergic' by the investigator. Investigators differed in how they categorized conjunctivitis to type, as there were no prespecified classification guidelines. Most cases reported as infectious (e.g. viral or bacterial) did not have laboratory confirmation of infectious aetiology. Most cases were not referred to ophthalmologists or other eye specialists.

The impact of baseline demographic and disease characteristics; baseline serum levels of thymus and activation‐regulated chemokine (TARC; CCL17), IgE and blood eosinophil counts; and efficacy responses on conjunctivitis incidence rates were summarized for the monotherapy pool, CHRONOS and CAFÉ. We evaluated the relationship between dupilumab concentration and conjunctivitis in pooled data from SOLO 1, SOLO 2 and CHRONOS.

Red eye is the cardinal sign of ocular inflammation. The condition is usually benign and can be managed by primary care physicians. Conjunctivitis is the most common cause of red eye. Other common causes include blepharitis, corneal abrasion, foreign body, subconjunctival hemorrhage, keratitis, iritis, glaucoma, chemical burn, and scleritis. Signs and symptoms of red eye include eye discharge, redness, pain, photophobia, itching, and visual changes. Generally, viral and bacterial conjunctivitis are self-limiting conditions, and serious complications are rare. Because there is no specific diagnostic test to differentiate viral from bacterial conjunctivitis, most cases are treated using broad-spectrum antibiotics. Allergies or irritants also may cause conjunctivitis. The cause of red eye can be diagnosed through a detailed patient history and careful eye examination, and treatment is based on the underlying etiology. Recognizing the need for emergent referral to an ophthalmologist is key in the primary care management of red eye. Referral is necessary when severe pain is not relieved with topical anesthetics; topical steroids are needed; or the patient has vision loss, copious purulent discharge, corneal involvement, traumatic eye injury, recent ocular surgery, distorted pupil, herpes infection, or recurrent infections.

### Treatment of neonatal chlamydial conjunctivitis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116FhUYG]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2018). Low credibility.

Data Extraction and Risk of Bias Assessment

We created and piloted a data-extraction form. One investigator extracted the data, and a second investigator verified the data. We extracted data to determine the characteristics of the study, the effects of treatments, and the risk of bias, and the risk of bias. We used the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for nonrandomized studies, because the articles we found reported the effects of only 1 treatment with no comparison. For before–after studies of 1 treatment, we did not answer the question of comparability of the groups. We resolved disagreements by discussion between the 2 investigators

Analysis and Assessment of the Evidence

We conducted a meta-analysis of dichotomous outcomes by using a random-effects generic inverse-variance method to calculate pooled proportions and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) in Review Manager 5.1 (Nordic Cochrane Center and the Cochrane Collaboration, Copenhagen, Denmark). Two investigators evaluated the certainty of evidence for each outcome by using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach and resolved any discrepancies. We assessed all GRADE domains, that is, risk of bias, inconsistency, imprecision, indirectness, publication bias, large effect, presence of a dose response, and plausible opposing confounders. According to the GRADE, we present the certainty of evidence as high, moderate, low, or very low.

### Conjunctivitis preferred practice pattern [^111ZRCei]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Prevalence and risk factors — conjunctivitis is a diagnosis that encompasses a diverse group of diseases that occur worldwide and affect all ages, all social strata, and all genders, and although there are no reliable figures that document the incidence or prevalence of all forms of conjunctivitis, this condition has been cited as one of the most frequent causes of patient self-referral; conjunctivitis infrequently causes permanent visual loss or structural damage, but the economic impact of the disease in terms of lost work and school time, cost of medical visits, diagnostic testing, and medication is considerable; the risk factors for developing conjunctivitis depend on the etiology, the associated and predisposing factors for the types of conjunctivitis that are most common or most important to treat are listed in Table 1, and symptoms may be exacerbated by the coexistence of blepharitis, dry eye, or other causes of ocular surface inflammation.

### Estimate of the direct and indirect annual cost of bacterial conjunctivitis in the United States [^112h36Z5]. BMC Ophthalmology (2009). Low credibility.

Epidemiology

Although the literature on the epidemiology of bacterial conjunctivitis contains several references to its highly contagious nature no overall population-based data exists on the incidence of bacterial conjunctivitis. In the United States it is estimated that 23% of bacterial conjunctivitis cases occur in the 0–2 year age range, 28% occur in the 3–9 year range, 13% occur in the 10–19 year range with the remaining 36% of cases occurring in adults.

Existing clinic-based estimates from Norway, have calculated that the prevalence of the most severe form of acute infective bacterial conjunctivitis is on the order of 30 out of 1000 patients in a general medical practice, though a correct diagnosis was only made in about two-thirds of these cases. Similar clinic-based data from the United Kingdom have pointed to a rise in the proportion of patients who have sought medical attention for conjunctivitis, rising from 284 per 10,000 in 1981–1982 to 395 per 10,000 over the period 1991–1992. It has further been estimated that acute bacterial conjunctivitis represents up to 1% of all visits to general practitioners in the United Kingdom. However, it has also been noted that general practitioners tend to over-diagnosis bacterial conjunctivitis due to the difficulties of differentiating between the bacterial and viral forms of the disease. In 2002 a survey of general practitioners in the United Kingdom found that only 36% felt that they could correctly differentiate between acute bacterial and viral conjunctivitis. Additionally, 95% of the physicians surveyed indicated they prescribed topical antibiotics to patients with suspected bacterial conjunctivitis.

Existing Economic Evidence

The treatment and management of U.S. bacterial conjunctivitis patients has never been fully quantified and the costs incurred by the healthcare system remain largely unknown. Several studies found that in both the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, 900,000 and 3.4 million prescriptions, respectively, for topical ocular antibiotics were issued at a cost of £5.9 million and £4.7 million, respectively. However, these studies included all aetiologies which gave rise to a prescription for topic ocular antibiotics and were not necessarily due to bacterial conjunctivitis. It is against this background, that the current study attempts to estimate the annual cost of healthcare resource utilization attributable to the management of bacterial conjunctivitis in the United States.

### Pediatricians' knowledge, attitude and practice on treating children with red eye disease [^114Fiw8h]. BMC Ophthalmology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Pediatricians play an important role in the early detection and prompt treatment of ocular disorders in children, including red eye disease. Our aim was to examine the knowledge level of pediatricians regarding treating children with red eye disease, as well as the factors that affect the knowledge level, and the potential implications of a low level of knowledge.

Methods

In this correlational quantitative study, 152 expert pediatricians completed a questionnaire that included questions on knowledge, attitudes, and experience in treating red eye disease.

Results

Respondents' mean level of knowledge was moderate. Most of the respondents (89.5%) knew that the most likely diagnosis for a child with red eyes and a discharge is viral conjunctivitis and that pain, blurred vision, and a clouded cornea, are symptoms indicative of a more complex systemic problem. In contrast, 78.3% of the pediatricians claimed that the treatment of choice for viral conjunctivitis is a conservative treatment that includes eye flushing and strict hygiene. However, 14.5% (n = 22) of the pediatricians were found to prescribe antibiotics. A negative association was found between the pediatrician's age and years of experience, and level of knowledge concerning treatment of children with red eye. A strong positive association was found between pediatricians' level of knowledge and their attitudes to performing eye tests. Moreover, a negative association was found between the level of knowledge and the number of cases in which pediatricians prescribed antibiotics for children with red eye.

Conclusions

The research findings indicate that lack of knowledge was more conspicuous among pediatricians with more experience. Knowledge appears to be critical both for readiness to treat red eye and for proper treatment. It is necessary to provide pediatricians with tools for treating eye disorders in children and to refresh their knowledge on red eye, particularly among pediatricians with more years of experience.

### Conjunctivitis in dupilumab clinical trials for adolescents with atopic dermatitis or asthma [^1121NuPm]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Conjunctivitis events were mild or moderate in severity — none of the cases were determined to be severe (Table 4), and none of the cases met SAE criteria. Similarly, the unspecified viral keratitis and allergic blepharitis events were considered mild, and neither event was an SAE. Most cases of conjunctivitis recovered/resolved during the treatment period (Table 4), as did the case of unspecified viral keratitis and the case of allergic blepharitis. Twelve dupilumab-treated patients (7.3%) and 4 (4.7%) placebo-treated patients received treatment for conjunctivitis. Treatments for conjunctivitis included anti-infective agents, anti-inflammatory therapies, combination products containing anti-infective agents and anti-inflammatory therapies, decongestants and anti-allergics (e.g. antihistamines, mast cell stabilizers, and alpha-adrenergic agonists), and other ophthalmologic preparations (ESM 2 – Table S1); the unspecified viral keratitis event was treated with tobramycin-dexamethasone eye drops, and the blepharitis event was treated with diphenhydramine hydrochloride.

### Pathogen surveillance for acute infectious conjunctivitis [^116vSDS7]. JAMA Ophthalmology (2023). High credibility.

Importance

Acute infectious conjunctivitis is a common ocular condition with major public health consequences.

Objective

To assess regional variations and microbial etiologies of acute infectious conjunctivitis to guide treatment.

Design, Setting, and Participants

In this cross-sectional study, patients with presumed acute infectious conjunctivitis were enrolled in the study at 5 sites (Honolulu, Hawaii; Los Angeles, San Francisco, and San Diego, California; and Petah-Tikva, Israel) from March 2021 to March 2023. Patients with allergic or toxic conjunctivitis were excluded.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Pathogens were identified by unbiased RNA deep sequencing.

Results

In all, 52 patients (mean [range] age, 48 [7–80] years; 31 females [60%]) were enrolled at 5 sites (6 patients from Honolulu, 9 from San Diego, 11 from Los Angeles, 13 from San Francisco, and 13 from Petah-Tikva). RNA deep sequencing detected human adenovirus species D in one-quarter of patients (13 of 52). A wide range of pathogens, including human coronavirus 229E, SARS-CoV-2, and herpes simplex virus type 1, was also identified, as well as several bacteria and fungi. Moreover, 62% (32 of 52) of patients presented with purulent discharge, while only 8% (4 of 52) of patients had confirmed bacterial pathogens.

Conclusion and Relevance

In this cross-sectional study, pathogens associated with acute infectious conjunctivitis varied between all 5 sites in the US and Israel. Purulent discharge was a common presenting sign in this study, with a low specificity for bacteria-associated conjunctivitis, suggesting that further diagnostic workup may be necessary to inform antibiotic stewardship. Additional research on cost-effectiveness of using RNA deep sequencing is needed to ascertain whether it is better to monitor patients clinically until resolution of disease.

### A review of the differential diagnosis of acute infectious conjunctivitis: implications for treatment and management [^112Q6fN6]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2020). Medium credibility.

Chlamydia is the cause of 1.8–5.6% of all acute conjunctivitis cases. Chlamydial conjunctivitis primarily has a unilateral presentation with concurrent genital infectionand presents with conjunctival redness, lymphoid follicle formation, or mild purulent discharge. A distinctive sign of this infection in adults is bulbar conjunctival follicles, which are absent in neonates/infants. Chlamydial conjunctivitis is typically spread through sexual contact. Chlamydia is the most common sexually transmitted disease in the United States, with 1,708,569 cases reported in 2017. From 2013 to 2017, the number of reported cases of chlamydia in the United States increased by 22%. In neonates, the eyes can be infected after vaginal delivery by infected mothers. Treatment includes oral azithromycin or oral doxycycline in adults, and erythromycin in neonates.

Allergic Conjunctivitis

Most cases of allergic conjunctivitis are attributable to seasonal allergies and present with bilateral symptoms. Mild to severe itching and redness are the key symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis, which can present with a watery or mucoid discharge. Treatment includes supportive measures (cold compress, artificial tears), topical or oral antihistamines, and mast cell inhibitors. A short course of topical corticosteroids can be used in select cases in which corneal involvement and herpetic infection have been ruled out; both conditions could worsen with steroid use.

Differential Diagnosis

To satisfy the American Academy of Ophthalmology Preferred Practice Pattern guidelines that treatment of conjunctivitis is directed at the root cause, physicians should manage patients by taking a systematic approach (Figure 2), considering the epidemiologic spectrum of infectious conjunctivitis, patient history, clinical exam, and — if needed — diagnostic tests.

### A randomized controlled trial of povidone-iodine / dexamethasone ophthalmic suspension for acute viral conjunctivitis [^1146oFo8]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2019). Medium credibility.

The observed safety profile of PVP-I/DEX in this study appeared to be consistent with the well-characterized safety profiles of PVP-I and DEX, and no patterns of AEs indicative of systemic toxicities or localized complications were identified. Overall, no serious AEs were reported and the majority of TEAEs were ocular in nature and mild in severity. Most of the AEs with a suspected relationship to treatment with PVP-I/DEX consisted of mild instillation-site pain. All nonocular TEAEs were mild and the only nonocular TEAEs that occurred in more than one patient in any treatment group were headache and dizziness. Importantly, no patients in this study discontinued due to AEs. The safety and tolerability results of the present study are consistent with results from the study conducted in India. In both studies, there were no increases in AEs that have been previously associated with the use of topical ocular corticosteroids, ie, increases in intraocular pressure, cataract development, or glaucoma.–

Infectious conjunctivitis is a clinically challenging condition due to the overlap of symptoms between bacterial and viral causes and because no treatment is approved for viral conjunctivitis. A drug that treats both adenoviral and bacterial conjunctivitis would mitigate the negative effects of misdiagnosis, which can occur in up to 50% of cases. Phase III clinical trials are ongoing in adults and children to evaluate the efficacy and safety of PVP-I 0.6%/DEX 0.1% in adenoviral conjunctivitis (NCT02998541 and NCT02998554).

Potential limitations of this study are that the study was conducted in a single country and that serotyping was not performed, which may limit the generalizability of the results. In addition, according to the instructions of the RPS Adeno-Detector Plus test used, the sensitivity of the test was 84%, so negative test samples that were not subsequently tested by quantitative PCR or CC-IFA could have been positive for adenovirus or other viruses.

Future studies evaluating the efficacy of PVP-I/DEX could be improved by modifying study eligibility criteria to increase the likelihood of enrolling subjects with confirmed adenoviral conjunctivitis. This may be achieved by the use of the AdenoPlus ® test as a screening test and/or better clinical assessment criteria. A study with an adequate number of subjects with adenoviral conjunctivitis confirmed by culture would enable a robust assessment of efficacy.

### A review of the differential diagnosis of acute infectious conjunctivitis: implications for treatment and management [^113a6hxf]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2020). Medium credibility.

Abbreviation: EKC, epidemic keratoconjunctivitis.

A complication of EKC is the formation of pseudomembranes on the palpebral conjunctiva in the early and later stages of the condition. Manual removal of these membranes causes minor bleeding but no damage to the underlying epithelium, and may prevent symblepharon formation in cases with severe inflammation. Multifocal subepithelial infiltrates may develop in the cornea within 7–10 days after the onset of clinical signs of infection. These can persist for weeks or even years in some cases. If left untreated, subepithelial infiltrates can cause scarring in the cornea, leading to irregular astigmatism and loss of visual acuity. Topical corticosteroids or steroid-sparing agents such as cyclosporine eye drops can be used to reduce the risk of scarring; however, topical corticosteroids should be used with caution, especially in later stages of recovery from adenoviral infection. It should be noted that subepithelial infiltrates may also be a feature of chlamydial conjunctivitis. As no medications are currently approved for adenoviral conjunctivitis, treatment is mainly supportive (cold compresses, chilled artificial tears)with instruction on infection control, as viral shedding continues after onset.

There are few virucidal agents in preclinical development. Povidone-iodine (PVP-I) was under investigation as a potential treatment because of its broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity. An ophthalmic suspension composed of PVP-I 0.6% and the corticosteroid dexamethasone 0.1% (PVP-I 0.6%/DEX 0.1%) has been evaluated in a Phase 2 trial. Results from this study showed that PVP-I 0.6%/DEX 0.1% treatment of patients with acute adenoviral conjunctivitis significantly improved clinical resolution and eradication of adenovirus in the study eye. Another compound, N-chlorotaurine, has broad-spectrum microbicidal activity due to its nonspecific reaction mechanism, and was investigated for the treatment of viral conjunctivitis. A 1% solution of N-chlorotaurine was well tolerated in patients with EKC and shortened the course of disease compared with gentamicin eye drops in a randomized phase 2b study. Topical ganciclovir 0.15% ophthalmic gel is approved in the United States for acute herpetic keratitis only.

Medication history will also be informative. For example, anticoagulants are associated with subconjunctival hemorrhage, and topiramate is associated with angle-closure glaucoma. Patients requiring steroids may be at risk of more severe disease or other pathology, and referral to an eye care provider is recommended. The clinical examination should also include an assessment of the lymph nodes (swollen submandibular and preauricular lymph nodes). Lymphadenopathy, such as an enlarged, tender preauricular lymph node, is more common in viral versus bacterial conjunctivitis.

The physical eye examination should inspect for visual acuity, discharge type, corneal opacity, abnormal pupil size or shape, eyelid swelling, and orbit protrusion or asymmetry. Referral to an ophthalmologist or eye care professional should be performed immediately for cases that involve visual loss, moderate to severe pain, severe purulent discharge, or any corneal involvement. Useful information can be obtained with a simple penlight in the absence of a slit lamp, especially as it pertains to measurement of the anterior chamber depth and the ruling out of angle closure. Viral conjunctivitis can vary in presentation, but tearing, clear to white discharge, redness, and bilaterality are very common. Viral conjunctivitis usually starts with one eye, with the second eye to follow within a few days. Bacterial conjunctivitis is strongly suggested by glued eyelids, lack of itching, and lack of history of conjunctivitis. A diagnostic index for bacterial conjunctivitis by van Weert et al suggests that younger adult patients with conjunctivitis who present without glued eyelids at awakening are less likely to have conjunctivitis with a bacterial origin; this risk increases with age and presentation of two glued eyes.

A slit lamp provides a more detailed appearance of the conjunctival epithelium that enables differentiation between various types of conjunctival inflammation (follicular, mainly infectious; papillary, mainly allergic; pseudomembranous, severe EKC; eosinophilic, allergic). Fluorescein staining in conjunction with slit lamp examination, highlights patterns of corneal fluorescein uptake and exposes anterior chamber inflammation.HSV infection typically appears as branching lesions with intensely stained end bulbs, while highly branched lesions without end bulbs are typical of VZV infection.

### About pink eye | Conjunctivitis (pink eye)… [^114x9GJK]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Conjunctivitis is one of the most common and treatable eye conditions.
- The most common causes of pink eye are viruses, bacteria, and allergens.
- Viral and bacterial pink eye are very contagious. What it is People often call conjunctivitis "pink eye" because it can cause the white of the eye to turn pink or red. Symptoms of pink eye can vary but typically include redness or swelling of the white of the eye or inner eyelid. The swelling makes blood vessels more visible. Signs and symptoms Some common symptoms in one or both eyes include:

- Pink or red color in the white of the eye
- Swelling of the eyelids or thin layer that lines the white of the eye
- Watery, teary eyes
- Feeling like something is in the eye or an urge to rub the eye
- Itchiness, irritation, and burning of the eye
- Discharge Other symptoms may occur. Some symptoms vary depending on the cause. Keep Reading: Symptoms of Pink Eye.

Who is at risk Anyone can get pink eye. However, newborns with symptoms of pink eye should be seen by a doctor right away. Neonatal conjunctivitis is a red or watery eye condition in a newborn caused by infection, irritation, or a blocked tear duct. When caused by an infection, neonatal conjunctivitis can be very serious. Keep Reading: Pink Eye in Newborns. Causes The most common causes of pink eye include:

- Viruses
- Bacteria
- Allergens Other causes include chemicals, contact lens wear, and foreign bodies in the eye like a loose eyelash. Keep Reading: Pink Eye: Causes and How It Spreads Prevention Viral and bacterial pink eye are very contagious. They can spread easily from person to person. You can prevent getting pink eye or spreading it to someone else by following some simple steps for good hygiene. Vaccines can prevent some infections connected to pink eye.

### Conjunctivitis preferred practice pattern [^115N4ftS]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Seasonal/perennial allergic conjunctivitis — management — Nonpharmacologic measures include that "Recommendations often include wearing sunglasses as a barrier to airborne allergens, cold compresses, refrigerated artificial tears, avoiding eye rubbing, and avoiding allergens", with additional measures such as "Hypoallergenic bedding, eyelid cleansers to remove allergens, frequent clothes washing, and bathing/showering before bedtime may also be helpful". Pharmacologic therapy notes that "Mild allergic conjunctivitis can be treated with an over-the-counter topical antihistamine/vasoconstrictor agent or with more effective second-generation topical histamine H1-receptor antagonists", many drops "can be stored in the refrigerator" for symptomatic relief, and chronic vasoconstrictor use "can be associated with rebound vasodilation once the agent is stopped". For recurrent or persistent disease, "mast-cell stabilizers can be used", and "Many new medications combine antihistamine activity with mast-cell stabilizing properties and can be used for either acute or chronic disease". Related comorbidity relief is described: "The use of topical mast-cell inhibitors can also be helpful in alleviating the symptoms of allergic rhinitis", including nasal spray or aerosols, while as a general precaution, "Indiscriminate use of topical antibiotics or corticosteroids should be avoided because antibiotics can induce toxicity, and corticosteroids can potentially prolong adenoviral infections and worsen HSV infections".

Abstract

Ligneous conjunctivitis is a rare cause of chronic conjunctivitis that may be triggered by ocular insults such as trauma or infections. We present an interesting case of ligneous conjunctivitis caused by a viral infection that responded well to conservative management. Topical cyclosporine and heparin are a good treatment regimen that caused resolution of lesions and prevented recurrences.

### Conjunctivitis preferred practice pattern [^112rQKH5]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Viral adenoviral conjunctivitis — clinical signs, exposures, course, and sequelae are outlined: Abrupt onset that may be unilateral or bilateral (often sequentially bilateral) with bulbar conjunctival injection, watery discharge, follicular reaction of inferior tarsal conjunctiva, chemosis, eyelid swelling, erythema, and can resemble orbital cellulitis on exam; distinctive signs include preauricular lymphadenopathy, petechial and subconjunctival hemorrhage, corneal epithelial defect, multifocal epithelial punctate keratitis evolving to anterior stromal keratitis, membrane/pseudomembrane formation, and eyelid ecchymosis. Associated/predisposing factors include exposure to infected individual (especially in school setting), concurrent upper respiratory infection, and recent ocular testing. The natural history is self-limited, with improvement of symptoms and signs within 5 to 14 days. Potential sequelae note that mild cases have none, whereas severe cases include conjunctival/subtarsal scarring, symblepharon, keratitis and dry eye, subepithelial corneal infiltrates from epidemic keratoconjunctivitis (EKC), corneal scarring, and lacrimal stenosis, and pseudomembranes are associated with higher rate of severe sequelae.

### A controlled trial of povidone-iodine to treat infectious conjunctivitis in children [^114Hs52b]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2002). Low credibility.

Purpose

To report the efficacy of povidone-iodine as a treatment for conjunctivitis in pediatric patients.

Design

Double-masked, controlled, prospective clinical trial.

Methods

In an ophthalmology clinic in a general hospital in Manila, Philippines, 459 children (mean [SD] age 6.6 [6.6] years; range, 7 months-21 years) with acute conjunctivitis were studied. Infected eyes were cultured for bacteria and underwent immunofluorescent testing for Chlamydia trachomatis. Viral conjunctivitis was diagnosed if bacterial cultures were negative and diagnostic criteria were met. Subjects were alternated to receive povidone-iodine 1.25% or neomycin-polymyxin-B-gramicidin ophthalmic solution, one drop 4 times daily in the affected eye. Ocular inflammation was evaluated daily by the family or patient and weekly by an ophthalmologist. The main outcome measures were days until cured and proportion cured after 1 and 2 weeks of treatment.

Results

Despite adequate statistical power (power > 80% for a 1-day difference and P < .05), there was no significant difference between treatment groups regarding the number of days to cure or proportion cured at 1 or 2 weeks whether caused by bacteria or virus (P = 0.133-.824 for the four comparisons). After 1 week of treatment, povidone-iodine cured marginally more chlamydial infections than the antibiotic (P = 0.057). By 2 weeks, fewer chlamydial infections were cured than those of viral or bacterial etiology (P = 0.0001). The younger the patient, the faster their conjunctivitis resolved (R = 0.13, P = 0.013).

Conclusions

Povidone-iodine 1.25% ophthalmic solution was as effective as neomycin-polymyxin B-gramicidin for treating bacterial conjunctivitis, somewhat more effective against chlamydia, and as ineffective against viral conjunctivitis. Povidone-iodine ophthalmic solution should be strongly considered as treatment for bacterial and chlamydial conjunctivitis, especially in developing countries where topical antibiotics are often unavailable or costly.

Results

The participants in this study were N = 152 pediatricians with a mean age of M = 45.8 (SD = 11.88) and a range of 27–82. Most were women (n = 100, 65.8%), where the mean number of years they had been working as pediatricians was M = 14.77 (SD = 13.42), and most were living in central Israel, 58% (see Table 1).

Table 1
Sociodemographic information of the pediatricians (N = 152)

To examine the knowledge level of the participants, 4 knowledge questions on treating red eye in children were explored. The research findings showed that the respondents' mean level of knowledge was moderate, M = 3.28 (SD = 0.77, range 1–4).

Most of the respondents (89.5%) knew that the most reasonable diagnosis for a child with red eyes and discharge is viral conjunctivitis, 7.9% thought that it was bacterial conjunctivitis, 2% a systemic disease, and 0.6% an allergy. Most of the respondents (89.5%) knew that pain, blurred vision, and a clouded cornea, are symptoms indicative of a more complex systemic problem.

Of all respondents, 78.3% claimed that the treatment of choice for viral conjunctivitis is a conservative treatment that includes eye flushing and strict hygiene. However, 14.5% (n = 22) of the pediatricians were found to prescribe antibiotics. In addition, 71.7% said that they would refer a child with red eye to an ophthalmologist in any case of disrupted or blurred vision.

### Management of adenoviral keratoconjunctivitis: challenges and solutions [^112Mxa5A]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Human adenovirus (HAdV) is the most common cause of infection to the ocular surface, accounting for up to 75% of conjunctivitis cases. The most common presentation is pharyngoconjunctival fever (PCF), which often occurs in children and manifests clinically with fever, pharyngitis, rhinitis, follicular conjunctivitis, and regional lymphoid hyperplasia. Epidemic keratoconjunctivitis (EKC) is the most severe ocular form and is distinguished by its ability to invade the corneal epithelium, ranging in presentation from a keratitis to persistent and recurrent subepithelial infiltrates (SEIs). HAdV is highly contagious due to its unique structure and ability to evade the normal host's immune system. It is distinguished from other types of conjunctivitis in that it often involves the cornea, with potentially devastating visual complications. These features contribute to a heavy economic burden and necessitate the establishment of a standard treatment protocol. In addition to the potential ocular manifestations of this virus, HAdV infections have the propensity to manifest systemically, in cases such as respiratory, urinary, and gastrointestinal tract (GIT) infections. This variety of presentations can infect a normal, healthy host, and also have an increased risk in immunocompromised individuals. Despite the detrimental effect that HAdV infections pose, there has yet to be an FDA-approved drug to treat these conditions, making management difficult. Even following the active phase of the disease, viral persistence and reactivation may occur. Oral and topical antivirals have been considered as off-label management solutions, but problems with efficacy, bioavailability, and therapeutic profiles have limited their use. With regards to EKC, topical disinfection during active cases as well as treatment of corneal sequelae using corticosteroids and immunosuppressive agents show promise. This review will focus on how persistence and dissemination of HAdV poses a significant challenge to the management of adenoviral keratoconjunctivitis. Furthermore, current and future trends in prophylactic and therapeutic modalities for adenoviral keratoconjunctivitis will be discussed.

What you should do

Recognising when to refer patients with a red eye to ophthalmology services, whether it is routine or urgently, is crucial (box 4). Figure 1 represents possible diagnoses to consider based on initial assessment.

Box 4
Conditions that require urgent referral to an ophthalmologist

Severe "conjunctivitis" that does not improve after several days of antibiotic treatment ("bacterial conjunctivitis") or lubricants ("viral conjunctivitis")
Corneal infection (especially in contact lens wearers)
Anterior uveitis
Acute angle-closure glaucoma
Endophthalmitis (suspect if the patient had intra-ocular surgery within the past week)
Ocular trauma (including mechanical, chemical, and thermal injury)
Scleritis
Orbital cellulitis

Patients with non-sight threatening red eye conditions — such as mild infectious or non-infectious conjunctivitis, subconjunctival haemorrhage, or mild corneal abrasion — can be reassured and managed in the community. Advise that most cases of acute viral and bacterial conjunctivitis will resolve without any treatment in 5–7 days. A trial of topical antibiotics (such as chloramphenicol or fusidic acid) can be started if symptoms are not resolving within three days of onset in bacterial conjunctivitis. If the condition does not improve or if it worsens after treatment, offer referral to an eye casualty unit for urgent ophthalmic assessment.

Suspected severe and potentially sight threatening conditions (box 4) or the presence of red flags (see box 1) warrant prompt ophthalmology referral. Patients with recurrent history of red eye related conditions warrant a face-to-face ophthalmology review. Ocular signs could be too subtle to be picked up by mobile imaging. Contact the local on-call ophthalmology team immediately for these patients.

Annualized incidence rates of overall conjunctivitis assessed as both the number of patients with one or more events per 100 PYs and the number of events per 100 PYs were higher in patients who received dupilumab than in those who received placebo (Table 3). Among patients who reported conjunctivitis, the median time to onset of the first conjunctivitis event was numerically shorter for dupilumab 300 mg q4w (37.0 days) than 200/300 mg q2w or placebo (57.0 days and 40.5 days, respectively) (Fig. 1 a); however, the HR for time to event did not show significant differences between treatment groups (Table 1). The incidence of conjunctivitis did not increase with increased dose/exposure of the drug (Fig. 1 b).

### Antibiotics versus placebo for acute bacterial conjunctivitis [^115L23qK]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute bacterial conjunctivitis is an infection of the conjunctiva and is one of the most common ocular disorders in primary care. Antibiotics are generally prescribed on the basis that they may speed recovery, reduce persistence, and prevent keratitis. However, many cases of acute bacterial conjunctivitis are self-limited, resolving without antibiotic therapy. This Cochrane Review was first published in The Cochrane Library in 1999, then updated in 2006, 2012, and 2022.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and side effects of antibiotic therapy in the management of acute bacterial conjunctivitis.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group Trials Register) (The Cochrane Library 2022, Issue 5), MEDLINE (January 1950 to May 2022), Embase (January 1980 to May 2022), the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT) (www.controlled-trials.com), ClinicalTrials.gov (www.

Clinicaltrials

gov), and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (www.who.int/ictrp/search/en). We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials. We last searched the electronic databases in May 2022. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in which any form of antibiotic treatment, with or without steroid, had been compared with placebo/vehicle in the management of acute bacterial conjunctivitis. This included topical and systemic antibiotic treatments.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently reviewed the titles and abstracts of identified studies. We assessed the full text of all potentially relevant studies and determined the included RCTs, which were further assessed for risk of bias using Cochrane methodology. We performed data extraction in a standardized manner and conducted random-effects meta-analyses using RevMan Web.

Main Results

We included 21 eligible RCTs, 10 of which were newly identified in this update. A total of 8805 participants were randomized. All treatments were topical in the form of drops or ointment. The trials were heterogeneous in terms of their eligibility criteria, the nature of the intervention (antibiotic drug class, which included fluoroquinolones [FQs] and non-FQs; dosage frequency; duration of treatment), the outcomes assessed and the time points of assessment. We judged one trial to be of high risk of bias, four as low risk of bias, and the others as raising some concerns. Based on intention-to-treat (ITT) population, antibiotics likely improved clinical cure (resolution of clinical symptoms or signs) by 26% (RR 1.26, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.46; 5 trials, 1474 participants; moderate certainty) as compared with placebo. Subgroup analysis showed no differences by antibiotic class (P = 0.67) or treatment duration (P = 0.60). In the placebo group, 55.5% (408/735) of participants had spontaneous clinical resolution by days 4 to 9 versus 68.2% (504/739) of participants treated with an antibiotic. Based on modified ITT population, in which participants were analyzed after randomization on the basis of positive microbiological culture, antibiotics likely increased microbiological cure (RR 1.53, 95% CI 1.34 to 1.74; 10 trials, 2827 participants) compared with placebo at the end of therapy; there were no subgroup differences by drug class (P = 0.60). No study evaluated the cost-effectiveness of antibiotic treatment. Patients receiving antibiotics had a lower risk of treatment incompletion than those in the placebo group (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.78; 13 trials, 5573 participants; moderate certainty) and were 27% less likely to have persistent clinical infection (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.65 to 0.81; 19 trials, 5280 participants; moderate certainty). There was no evidence of serious systemic side effects reported in either the antibiotic or placebo group (very low certainty). When compared with placebo, FQs (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.90) but not non-FQs (RR 4.05, 95% CI 1.36 to 12.00) may result in fewer participants with ocular side effects. However, the estimated effects were of very low certainty.

Authors' Conclusions

The findings of this update suggest that the use of topical antibiotics is associated with a modestly improved chance of resolution in comparison to the use of placebo. Since no evidence of serious side effects was reported, use of antibiotics may therefore be considered to achieve better clinical and microbiologic efficacy than placebo. Increasing the proportion of participants with clinical cure or increasing the speed of recovery or both are important for individual return to work or school, allowing people to regain quality of life. Future studies may examine antiseptic treatments with topical antibiotics for reasons of cost and growing antibiotic resistance.

### Viral ocular manifestations: a broad overview [^11437Pwh]. Reviews in Medical Virology (2013). Low credibility.

The viruses able to affect the eye are taxonomically diverse, ranging from double-stranded DNA viruses, to single stranded RNA viruses, to retroviruses. Any part of the eye may be affected, frequently producing blepharitis, conjunctivitis, keratitis, uveitis, cataract and retinitis. The more common ocular viral infections include the Herpesviruses such as HSV-1, VZV and CMV. The HIV pandemic is placing a serious burden on ophthalmology clinics, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa as the number of viral ocular diseases is increasing. In particular, CMV retinitis is becoming more prevalent where antiretroviral therapy is not available and is replaced by immune-recovery uveitis where antiretrovirals are given. This review aims to improve knowledge of the common viral ocular diseases, their diagnosis and management, as well as the fairly uncommon viral ocular diseases that may also cause considerable morbidity.

Mpox treatment failure evaluation and consultation: Other possible reasons for treatment failure include a dysregulated immune response with associated inflammation or the presence of another opportunistic infection, and if viable MPXV is still detected by culture, then viral replication and ongoing infection might be driving the disease process and antiviral medications should be continued. Biopsy of the affected tissue can be performed in cases with new or atypical lesions where it is unclear if the lesions are primarily due to mpox or another infectious cause, including secondary bacterial or fungal infections, and in cases with significant complications (e.g., mucosal or bowel lesions, severe lymphadenopathy, pulmonary nodular lesions, severe conjunctivitis), and consultation with infectious disease specialists and the CDC is encouraged.

Conjunctivitis (pink eye)

Background

Conjunctivitis is an inflammation of the inside surface lining of the eyelids and covering of the eyeball. The eye may appear red and may have a clear or cloudy discharge. Conjunctivitis has both noninfectious and infectious causes that can be bacterial or viral. Conjunctivitis does not necessarily require treatment with topical or oral antibiotics.

Many large, community-based outbreaks of conjunctivitis, including outbreaks among school children, on college campuses, and in military facilities have been documented. – In neonates, conjunctivitis can be associated with serious invasive disease that involves multiple organs. Careful hand hygiene can reduce transmission.

Individuals who have conjunctivitis should be considered contagious until their symptoms have resolved. The viruses and bacteria that most commonly cause conjunctivitis are transmitted to eyes from hands that are contaminated with the infectious eye drainage, from contaminated objects (shared towels and washcloths, eye drop solution, or contact lens solution), or potentially by direct inoculation into the eye via large respiratory droplets from an ill individual who is coughing.

Recommendations

Restrict individuals with severe conjunctivitis (i.e. copious eye discharge, eye irritation causing frequent eye rubbing or itching, or conjunctivitis accompanied by fever or respiratory symptoms) from entering the family-centered residential facility.
Allow individuals with mild conjunctivitis ("pink eye" with no active discharge, minimum eye irritation, and no fever) to enter the facility, but require such guests to stay in their personal room until their symptoms have resolved.
Allow individuals who were exposed to a person with conjunctivitis but who do not have symptoms of illness to enter the facility. No special precautions are required.
Educate guests and visitors about the importance of frequent hand hygiene, avoidance of sharing personal items (e.g. towels and washcloths, eye drops, and contact lens solutions), and prompt removal and careful handling of contaminated items (e.g. tissues, towels, and linens).

### Antiviral treatment and other therapeutic interventions for herpes simplex virus epithelial keratitis [^113BWjHN]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Eye disease due to herpes simplex virus (HSV) commonly presents as epithelial keratitis which, though usually self-limiting, may persist or progress without treatment.

Objectives

To compare the relative effectiveness of antiviral agents, interferon, and corneal debridement in the treatment of HSV epithelial keratitis.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group Trials Register) (2014, Issue 12), PubMed (January 1946 to 31 December 2014), EMBASE (January 1980 to 31 December 2014), Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature Database (LILACS) (January 1982 to 31 December 2014), System for Information on Grey Literature in Europe (OpenGrey) (January 1995 to 31 December 2014), BIOSIS (January 1926 to 5 May 2014), Scopus (January 1966 to 31 December 2014), Japan Science and Technology Institute (J-Global) (January 1975 to 31 December 2014), China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) (January 1979 to 31 December 2014), British Library's Electronic Table of Contents (Zetoc) (January 1993 to 7 May 2014). We looked for trials listed on the the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (www.controlled-trials.com), ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov), the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (www.who.int/ictrp/search/en), Chinese Clinical Trial Registry, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) (www.fda.gov/), National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) (www.

Evidence

nhs.uk) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) (www.ema.europa.eu/ema/) as of 31 December 2014. There were no language or date restrictions in the search for trials. We also culled literature digests and conference proceedings as of 15 April 2014. There were no language or date restrictions in the search for trials.

Selection Criteria

Randomised and quasi-randomised trials of HSV dendritic or geographic epithelial keratitis were included that reported the proportion of eyes healed at one week, two weeks, or both after enrolment.

Data Collection and Analysis

We tabulated data on study characteristics, risk of bias, and outcomes and used direct comparisons to estimate a risk ratio (RR) and, when feasible, a hazard ratio (HR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI). Heterogeneity was assessed by an inconsistency index. A multiple treatment comparison meta-analysis consolidated direct and indirect comparisons of relative healing at 14 days.

Main Results

One hundred thirty-seven studies involving 8333 eyes met the inclusion criteria. Placebo-controlled studies were heterogeneous in comparison with idoxuridine (RR 1.74; 95% CI 1.03 to 2.91) and few in number for vidarabine (RR 1.81; 95% CI 1.09 to 3.01), interferon (RR 1.32; 95% CI 1.06 to 1.64), and debridement. Vidarabine (RR 1.13; 95% CI 1.02 to 1.25), trifluridine (RR 1.30; 95% CI 1.18 to 1.43), acyclovir (RR 1.23; 95% CI 1.14 to 1.34), and brivudine (RR 1.34; 95% CI 1.18 to 1.51) were more effective than idoxuridine. Trifluridine (RR 1.17; 95% CI 1.03 to 1.32) and acyclovir (RR 1.11; 95% CI 1.03 to 1.19) were more effective than vidarabine. No significant differences in healing emerged among trifluridine, acyclovir, brivudine, and foscarnet although few studies compared brivudine or foscarnet with other antivirals. Any potential advantage of ganciclovir compared to acyclovir was mitigated by study heterogeneity and possible publication bias. Only one study evaluated the joint use of two topical antivirals. In a limited number of studies, oral acyclovir (RR 0.92; 95% CI 0.79 to 1.07) or the combination of oral acyclovir with a topical antiviral (RR 1.36; 95% CI 0.68 to 2.74) appeared as effective as a single topical antiviral agent. Compared to topical antiviral monotherapy, the combination of an antiviral with either interferon or debridement had inconsistent effects on expediting healing and improving outcome.

Authors' Conclusions

Placebo-controlled studies of HSV epithelial keratitis are limited to superseded interventions. Trifluridine and acyclovir are more effective than idoxuridine or vidarabine and similar in therapeutic effectiveness. Brivudine and foscarnet do not substantially differ in effectiveness from trifluridine or acyclovir. Ganciclovir is at least as effective as acyclovir. The addition of interferon to a nucleoside antiviral agent and the combination of debridement with antiviral treatment need to be further assessed to substantiate any possible advantage in healing.
