## Question

can i give zofran to a bradycardic patient

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether ondansetron (Zofran) can be safely administered to a patient with pre-existing bradycardia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what the FDA labeling and postmarketing data actually say about bradycardia, QT prolongation, and monitoring requirements. Then, I should verify the pathophysiologic interaction between bradycardia and drug-induced QT effects. Next, I will review clinical evidence, including case reports and studies, to estimate real-world risk. After that, I need to stratify risk factors and consider dosing, route, and monitoring strategies. Finally, I should synthesize a practical, patient-specific recommendation and confirm documentation points to ensure safety and traceability.

> Let me first confirm the basic facts. Ondansetron is a selective 5‑HT3 receptor antagonist antiemetic, and bradycardia is both a reported adverse reaction and a clinical context highlighted in its cardiac warnings. The FDA labeling warns of dose‑dependent QT prolongation and reports torsades de pointes cases, advising ECG monitoring in patients with bradyarrhythmias and avoidance in congenital long QT syndrome. Bradycardia itself has been reported postmarketing, especially with IV use, as part of a broader set of cardiovascular events including QT/QTc prolongation and arrhythmias. I need to ensure I'm not overstating this as an absolute contraindication because, to be precise, bradycardia is a risk factor necessitating caution and monitoring rather than a labeled absolute contraindication [^112jZ7ak] [^1129B9Jj] [^116f19NM].

> Next, I should review the electrophysiologic risk more closely. Ondansetron prolongs cardiac repolarization in a concentration‑dependent manner, with mean placebo‑corrected QTcF increases of approximately 5.6 ms at 8 mg IV and about 19.5 ms at 32 mg IV over 15 minutes in healthy subjects. Hold on, I should verify whether this translates into clinical arrhythmia risk on its own; the label links QT effects to rare torsades events, and it calls for ECG monitoring in bradyarrhythmias, heart failure, electrolyte derangements, or concomitant QT‑prolonging drugs, which directly implicates bradycardia as an additive risk state rather than an isolated prohibition [^113uwLLs] [^116rDZPX] [^113WRsKq].

> Now, let me consider the pathophysiology. Bradycardia reduces repolarization reserve and is a known substrate that can potentiate drug‑induced QT prolongation and early afterdepolarizations, increasing torsades susceptibility. Wait, let me verify that the regulatory guidance acknowledges this link operationally; yes, the label's recommendation for ECG monitoring in bradyarrhythmias implies heightened vulnerability, and case reports show torsades can occur after even low‑dose IV ondansetron when other risks, such as hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia, coexist, underscoring the synergy of multiple risk factors rather than the drug acting in isolation [^112jZ7ak] [^115Vq7s6].

> I will now examine the clinical evidence beyond the label to calibrate risk. Prospective ED data show mean QTc prolongation of about 20 ms after 4 mg IV without serious arrhythmic events in small cohorts, while a larger randomized outpatient gastroenteritis trial using a 24‑mg bimodal‑release oral formulation found no excess QTc prolongation versus placebo at peak exposure in patients with normal baseline QTc. But wait, these favorable data are context‑dependent; a systematic review of postmarketing and published cases shows most serious events involved IV administration and additional risk factors such as concomitant QT‑prolonging agents or cardiac disease, which suggests that route and comorbid risks matter substantially [^115iR6QT] [^113VW3TZ] [^116EhuEN].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions because some peri‑spinal anesthesia literature reports that ondansetron reduces bradycardia and hypotension via Bezold‑Jarisch reflex blockade. I should double‑check generalizability. Meta‑analytic and trial data suggest potential reductions in spinal anesthesia‑induced hypotension and bradycardia, but with low‑quality evidence and risk of bias, and this mechanism is specific to reflex‑mediated hemodynamic changes, not to baseline bradycardia in medical patients. So, I need to avoid extrapolating these findings to routine bradycardic contexts outside neuraxial anesthesia [^111NcKE3] [^112zCDAt] [^116udL15].

> Next, I should review pediatric and broader pharmacoepidemiologic signals to avoid overestimating absolute risk. A large pediatric retrospective series estimated a very low overall risk of ventricular arrhythmia temporally linked to ondansetron, with almost all cases having major cardiac comorbidities, consistent with a risk‑amplification model rather than a universal hazard. Additionally, low‑dose comparisons with other antiemetics show measurable but modest QTc effects with ondansetron in postoperative settings, again reinforcing that arrhythmia risk is generally low but not negligible, especially IV and in at‑risk patients [^113FpARa] [^1126be5U].

> I need to ensure a careful risk stratification for a bradycardic patient before deciding. Severity of bradycardia, presence of electrolyte abnormalities, concomitant QT‑prolonging medications, structural heart disease, and congenital long QT are critical determinants. Route and dose matter, with IV administration and higher exposure increasing QT effects. The FDA explicitly advises ECG monitoring in bradyarrhythmias and correcting hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia before administration, and it advises avoiding use in congenital long QT syndrome. I should confirm again that bradycardia alone is not an absolute contraindication but clearly elevates monitoring needs and favors lower exposure strategies [^112jZ7ak] [^113WRsKq] [^113HbmEz].

> Let me think about dosing and monitoring tactics now. Prefer oral administration when feasible, use the lowest effective dose, and avoid rapid IV push if parenteral dosing is necessary, given the concentration‑dependent QT effect observed at higher IV doses. I almost said ECG monitoring is mandatory for every bradycardic patient, but wait, I should correct that wording: the label states ECG monitoring is recommended in patients with bradyarrhythmias, which in practice means obtaining a baseline ECG, correcting electrolytes first, and observing on telemetry during and shortly after IV dosing when risk is nontrivial. If any additional risk factors are present, the threshold for continuous monitoring and repeat ECGs should be low [^113uwLLs] [^112jZ7ak] [^113WRsKq].

> I should consider alternatives in higher‑risk bradycardic scenarios. Metoclopramide or prochlorperazine can be considered but also carry their own cardiac and neurologic risks, and droperidol has explicit cautions with bradycardia and QT prolongation, so that is not a safer choice here. An option with limited QT liability at antiemetic doses is IV amisulpride for postoperative nausea and vomiting, which did not meaningfully prolong QTc at 5 mg and showed only small effects at 10 mg in healthy volunteers; however, coadministration with ondansetron can additively affect QT, so stacking antiemetics should be avoided in high‑risk patients. The choice should be individualized based on indication, comorbidities, and available monitoring [^117MdiTG] [^115egx6f] [^113WRsKq].

> Now, I will synthesize the risk‑benefit answer to the clinical question. Can I give ondansetron to a bradycardic patient. Yes, but with significant qualifications: it is not absolutely contraindicated; however, bradycardia is a risk factor that necessitates baseline ECG assessment, correction of electrolytes, careful review of concomitant QT‑prolonging agents, and preference for oral dosing and the lowest effective dose, with ECG monitoring recommended if IV dosing or additional risk factors are present. In stable, mild bradycardia without other risks, the absolute risk appears low but not zero; in marked bradycardia or when multiple risks co‑exist, consider an alternative antiemetic or use ondansetron only with robust monitoring and clear benefit justification [^112jZ7ak] [^116EhuEN] [^113uwLLs].

> But wait, what if the patient is peri‑spinal anesthesia with reflex bradycardia concerns. I should clarify that while ondansetron may mitigate spinal anesthesia‑induced hypotension and bradycardia via a distinct mechanism, these data do not supersede the general torsades risk framework in medically bradycardic patients, so case‑specific anesthesia physiology must be distinguished from baseline bradycardia due to conduction disease or medications when deciding on use and monitoring [^111NcKE3] [^112zCDAt] [^116udL15].

> Finally, I need to ensure good documentation. I should record baseline rhythm and heart rate, a formal ECG interpretation with QTc, serum potassium and magnesium with any repletion, concurrent QT‑prolonging drugs reviewed, the risk‑benefit discussion, the monitoring plan including telemetry if IV dosing is used, and any patient counseling about arrhythmia warning symptoms. This level of documentation aligns with labeling expectations for patient counseling and monitoring around QT risk and serious cardiovascular adverse events [^113bRTrd] [^114JMGsD] [^113HbmEz].

---

Yes, ondansetron (Zofran) may be used in bradycardic patients when clinically indicated, but **use with caution** because it can prolong the QT interval [^1129B9Jj] and cause bradyarrhythmias [^1129B9Jj]. Avoid in **congenital long QT syndrome** [^112jZ7ak] and **monitor the ECG** in patients with bradyarrhythmias, electrolyte abnormalities [^113WRsKq], or concomitant QT-prolonging drugs [^113WRsKq]. Use the lowest effective dose [^1129B9Jj], correct electrolytes [^113HbmEz], and monitor for arrhythmias; consider alternatives if the risk is high [^116EhuEN].

---

## Pharmacological considerations

Ondansetron is a selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonist [^113yv8Mq] used to prevent **nausea and vomiting** [^112XaeTC]. It can cause **dose-dependent QT prolongation** [^1129B9Jj] and has been associated with torsades de pointes, particularly with IV use [^113uwLLs] or in predisposed patients [^112jZ7ak] [^112f1GDE].

---

## Clinical evidence of cardiac effects

Clinical and postmarketing data [^116Jhf9W] show ondansetron can cause **bradycardia** [^116Ze6VX], **QT prolongation**, and **torsades de pointes** [^116EhuEN], particularly in patients with bradyarrhythmias or other risk factors [^112jZ7ak]. The risk is **higher with IV administration** [^112f1GDE] [^115iR6QT] and in patients with electrolyte abnormalities, heart failure, or concomitant QT-prolonging drugs [^113WRsKq] [^112jZ7ak].

---

## FDA warnings and precautions

The FDA warns that ondansetron can cause **QT prolongation and torsades de pointes** [^113WRsKq]; **avoid in congenital long QT syndrome** [^112jZ7ak], and monitor the ECG [^113bRTrd] in patients with electrolyte abnormalities, heart failure, bradyarrhythmias, or concomitant QT-prolonging drugs [^112f1GDE]. **Bradycardia** is a known adverse effect, especially with IV use [^112f1GDE] [^116q9uVf].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

There are **no specific guidelines** for ondansetron in bradycardic patients, but **general recommendations** include:

- Avoid in **congenital long QT syndrome** [^112jZ7ak] [^113WRsKq].
- **Monitor ECG**: in patients with bradyarrhythmias, electrolyte abnormalities, or other QT-prolonging drugs [^112jZ7ak] [^112f1GDE] [^113bRTrd].
- **Use lowest effective dose** and avoid rapid IV administration [^1129B9Jj] [^116tcX1V].

---

## Clinical scenarios and risk assessment

Ondansetron may be appropriate in bradycardic patients when **benefits outweigh risks**, such as:

- **Severe nausea/vomiting**: requiring effective antiemesis.
- **No alternatives** or alternatives are less effective or have higher risk.
- **Correctable risk factors**: such as electrolyte abnormalities [^113WRsKq].

However, **avoid** or use with **extreme caution** in:

- **Congenital long QT syndrome** [^112jZ7ak] [^112f1GDE].
- **Severe bradyarrhythmias** or significant conduction disease [^116Ze6VX].
- **Multiple QT-prolonging drugs** or uncorrectable electrolyte abnormalities [^113WRsKq].

---

## Practical recommendations for clinical practice

When ondansetron is **necessary in bradycardic patients**:

- **Baseline ECG**: to assess QT interval and rhythm [^112jZ7ak].
- **Correct electrolytes**: potassium and magnesium before administration [^113WRsKq].
- **Use lowest effective dose** and avoid rapid IV push [^1129B9Jj] [^116tcX1V].
- **Monitor ECG** and heart rate during and after administration [^113bRTrd].
- **Be prepared**: to manage arrhythmias, including torsades de pointes [^115Vq7s6].

---

## Alternative antiemetic options

Consider alternatives with **lower QT risk** [^115egx6f] in high-risk bradycardic patients, such as metoclopramide (lower QT risk than ondansetron) or promethazine (use cautiously due to sedation and hypotension). **Dexamethasone** is another option that is effective for chemotherapy-induced nausea [^112U1sj1].

---

Ondansetron may be used in bradycardic patients when necessary, but **use with caution** because of QT prolongation and bradyarrhythmia risk [^112jZ7ak]. Avoid in **congenital long QT syndrome**, monitor the ECG, correct electrolytes, and use the lowest effective dose; consider alternatives if the risk is high.

### QT prolongation, torsades des pointes, and cardiac arrest after 4 mg of IV ondansetron [^115Vq7s6]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Ondansetron is a commonly used antiemetic in the emergency department despite a 2011 FDA warning regarding dose-related QTc prolongation and torsades des pointes (TdP). Cases of TdP from small ondansetron doses administered in the emergency department are lacking. A 41-year-old woman with alcohol use disorder on no medications or supplements presented to an emergency department with one day of nausea, vomiting, and epigastric pain. Examination revealed a pulse of 77 beats/min and epigastric tenderness. The patient received 4 mg IV ondansetron, 30 mg IV ketorolac, and was placed on cardiac monitoring. An ECG obtained one minute after ondansetron administration demonstrated premature ventricular contractions with QTc = 653 ms. Thirteen minutes after receiving ondansetron, she suffered TdP and cardiac arrest. She received immediate CPR and IV epinephrine with successful defibrillation at one minute. She then received IV magnesium. Post-arrest ECGs demonstrated persistent QTc prolongation immediately and at three hours post-arrest. Laboratory studies, drawn prior to arrest, demonstrated hypokalemia (3.2 mEq/L), hypomagnesemia (1.3 mg/dL), and elevated lipase (4918 IU/L). She received no additional QT-prolonging agents. Transthoracic echocardiogram and troponins were normal; ECG intervals completely normalized within 12 hours, and she was discharged neurologically intact. The patient returned 18 months later with recurrent pancreatitis and similar electrolyte abnormalities; QT-prolonging drugs were avoided at that time, and her course was uncomplicated.

### Risk of ventricular arrhythmias and association with ondansetron [^113FpARa]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

To evaluate the use of ondansetron in a tertiary care pediatric health system, we assessed the incidence of ventricular tachyarrhythmia within 24 hours of ondansetron administration. Additionally, we aimed to identify the characteristics of children experiencing a ventricular tachyarrhythmia after ondansetron to pinpoint potential risk factors.

- **Study design**: This retrospective chart review identified children aged 18 years or younger who received ondansetron within 24 hours prior to a ventricular tachyarrhythmia. These cases were evaluated for other diagnoses, concomitant medication use, electrolyte abnormalities, or underlying conduction abnormalities that may have contributed to the arrhythmia.

- **Results**: A total of 199,773 doses of ondansetron were administered to 37,794 patients over 58,009 visits. The average dose was 0.13 mg/kg/dose (range 0.005–0.86 mg/kg/dose). Seven patients received ondansetron within 24 hours prior to a ventricular arrhythmia. All seven patients had underlying congenital cardiac conduction abnormalities (n = 3) or other major cardiac diagnoses (n = 4). Clinical review found torsades de pointes in only one of the seven patients.

- **Conclusions**: The risk of ventricular arrhythmia within 24 hours after ondansetron administration was determined to be 3 in 100,000 patients treated annually (0.003%). Children with major cardiac conditions could be considered for electrocardiogram screening and continuous cardiac monitoring while receiving ondansetron. Our findings do not support recommendations for electrocardiogram screening or continuous monitoring of other pediatric populations.

### Antiemetic guidelines: Are they being used [^111Sgy9g]. The Lancet Oncology (2005). Low credibility.

Evidence-based guidelines are regarded as therapeutic standards for many medical interventions. However, implementation of such recommendations seems to be rather difficult. An international antiemetic guideline for the treatment of patients undergoing chemotherapy was issued by the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer in 1997 and has been in use ever since. However, for many reasons, the guideline has not been followed completely, despite the fact that if antiemetics are used in accordance with guidelines, efficacy is similar to that achieved in randomized controlled trials.

Structural difficulties, patient characteristics, and other barriers — such as the individual acceptance of guidelines and education of physicians and nurses — could be crucial factors for successful implementation. Thus, better adherence to antiemetic guidelines can only be achieved through a complex and long-term process, consisting of efficient education, training, and monitoring of all individuals involved.

### Efficacy and safety of ondansetron in preventing postanesthesia shivering: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^114Q1Fof]. BMC Anesthesiology (2014). High credibility.

In recent years, with increasing awareness of its undesirable aftermath, effective prevention of postanesthesia shivering (PAS) has become imperative. It has been reported that PAS can be prevented by warming the skin surface and warming the administered fluids, but these methods are not perfect. Many drugs have been shown to be effective in preventing PAS, such as opioids, α2-agonists, anticholinergics, CNS stimulants, and corticosteroids. However, few are recommended for the prevention of PAS due to various side effects. For instance, clonidine, a partial α2 adrenergic agonist, is associated with bradycardia, hypotension, and sedation.

Ondansetron, a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist, is widely used to prevent postoperative and pregnancy-related nausea and vomiting. 5-HT can affect body temperature and shivering in rats, as the balance of norepinephrine and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) in the preoptic-anterior hypothalamus controls the temperature set point. Consistently, several studies have demonstrated that ondansetron can prevent PAS, making ondansetron a promising drug for postoperative complications, including PAS, nausea, and vomiting. However, a large-sample study conducted by Browning et al. presented that ondansetron did not prevent PAS among women undergoing combined spinal and epidural anesthesia for cesarean delivery. To our knowledge, there is no meta-analysis to identify the precise effect of ondansetron on PAS. Therefore, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials to evaluate and quantify the preventive effect of ondansetron.

### Ondansetron hydrochloride [^116rDZPX]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Ondansetron is a selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonist. While its mechanism of action has not been fully characterized, ondansetron is not a dopamine-receptor antagonist. Serotonin receptors of the 5-HT3 type are present both peripherally on vagal nerve terminals and centrally in the chemoreceptor trigger zone of the area postrema. It is not certain whether ondansetron's antiemetic action is mediated centrally, peripherally, or in both sites. However, cytotoxic chemotherapy appears to be associated with the release of serotonin from the enterochromaffin cells of the small intestine. In humans, urinary 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) excretion increases after cisplatin administration in parallel with the onset of emesis. The released serotonin may stimulate the vagal afferents through the 5-HT3 receptors and initiate the vomiting reflex.

- **Pharmacodynamics**: In healthy subjects, single intravenous doses of 0.15 mg/kg of ondansetron had no effect on esophageal motility, gastric motility, lower esophageal sphincter pressure, or small intestinal transit time. Multiday administration of ondansetron has been shown to slow colonic transit in healthy subjects. Ondansetron has no effect on plasma-prolactin concentrations.

- **Cardiac electrophysiology**: QTc interval prolongation was studied in a double-blind, single-intravenous dose, placebo- and positive-controlled, crossover trial in 58 healthy subjects. The maximum mean (95% upper confidence bound) difference in QTcF from placebo after baseline correction was 19.5 (21.8) milliseconds and 5.6 (7.4) milliseconds.

### Ondansetron hydrochloride [^113uwLLs]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **Mechanism of action**: Ondansetron is a selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonist. While ondansetron's mechanism of action has not been fully characterized, it is not a dopamine-receptor antagonist.

- **Pharmacodynamics**: In normal volunteers, single intravenous doses of 0.15 mg/kg of ondansetron had no effect on esophageal motility, gastric motility, lower esophageal sphincter pressure, or small intestinal transit time. In another trial with six normal male volunteers, a 16 mg dose infused over 5 minutes showed no effect of the drug on cardiac output, heart rate, stroke volume, blood pressure, or ECG. Multiday administration of ondansetron has been shown to slow colonic transit in normal volunteers. Ondansetron has no effect on plasma prolactin concentrations. In a gender-balanced pharmacodynamic trial (n = 56), ondansetron 4 mg administered intravenously or intramuscularly was dynamically similar in the prevention of nausea and vomiting using the ipecacuanha model of emesis.

- **Cardiac electrophysiology**: QTc interval prolongation was studied in a double-blind, single intravenous dose, placebo- and positive-controlled, crossover trial in 58 healthy subjects. The maximum mean (95% upper confidence bound) difference in QTcF from placebo after baseline-correction was 19.5 (21.8) ms and 5.6 (7.4) ms after 15-minute intravenous infusions of 32 mg and 8 mg ondansetron, respectively. A significant exposure-response relationship was identified between ondansetron concentration and ΔΔQTcF. Using the established exposure-response relationship, 24 mg infused intravenously over 15 minutes demonstrated significant effects.

### Comparative safety and effectiveness of serotonin receptor antagonists in patients undergoing chemotherapy: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^112U1sj1]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Although serotonin (5-HT3) receptor antagonists are effective in reducing nausea and vomiting, they may be associated with increased cardiac risk. Our objective was to examine the comparative safety and effectiveness of 5-HT3 receptor antagonists (e.g. dolasetron, granisetron, ondansetron, palonosetron, tropisetron) alone or combined with steroids for patients undergoing chemotherapy.

- **Methods**: We searched MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from inception until December 2015 for studies comparing 5-HT3 receptor antagonists with each other or placebo in chemotherapy patients. The search results were screened, data were abstracted, and risk of bias was appraised by pairs of reviewers, independently. Random-effects meta-analyses and network meta-analyses (NMAs) were conducted.

- **Results**: After screening 9,226 citations and 970 full-text articles, we included 299 studies (n = 58,412 patients). None of the included studies reported harms for active treatment versus placebo. For NMAs on the risk of arrhythmia (primary outcome; three randomized controlled trials [RCTs], 627 adults) and mortality (secondary outcome; eight RCTs, 4,823 adults), no statistically significant differences were observed between agents. A NMA on the risk of QTc prolongation showed a significantly greater risk for dolasetron + dexamethasone versus ondansetron + dexamethasone (four RCTs, 3,358 children and adults, odds ratio 2.94, 95% confidence interval 2.13–4.17).

For NMAs on the number of patients without nausea (44 RCTs, 11,664 adults, 12 treatments), the analysis was truncated.

### Ondansetron [^1127RGEF]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

In the same trial, 56% of patients receiving a single 24-mg oral dose of ondansetron experienced no nausea during the 24-hour trial period, compared with 36% of patients in the oral ondansetron 8‑mg twice-a-day group (P = 0.001) and 50% in the oral ondansetron 32-mg once-a-day group. Dosage regimens of ondansetron 8 mg twice daily and 32 mg once daily are not recommended for the prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with highly emetogenic chemotherapy [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)].

In a second trial, the efficacy of a single 24-mg oral dose of ondansetron for the prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with highly emetogenic cancer chemotherapy, including cisplatin greater than or equal to 50 mg/m², was confirmed.

- **Moderately emetogenic chemotherapy**: A randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial was conducted in the US in 67 patients receiving a cyclophosphamide-based chemotherapy regimen containing doxorubicin. The first 8-mg dose of ondansetron was administered 30 minutes before the start of chemotherapy, with a subsequent dose 8 hours after the first dose, followed by 8 mg of ondansetron twice a day for 2 days after the completion of chemotherapy.

### Efficacy and safety of ondansetron in preventing postanesthesia shivering: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^115Xu8nJ]. BMC Anesthesiology (2014). High credibility.

According to our findings, compared with a placebo, ondansetron could reduce the prevalence of PAS from 49.3% (placebo) to 23.4% without increased risk of bradycardia. However, no superiority was observed in ondansetron over meperidine in the effect of antishivering and incidence of bradycardia.

The serotonin system plays an important role in thermoregulation. The mechanisms of ondansetron on PAS may be related to a central mechanism involving the inhibition of 5-HT reuptake in the preoptic anterior hypothalamic region. It was proven that a 5-HT3 agonist could induce hyperthermia, while its antagonist could lead to hypothermia. However, in healthy volunteers, the core-temperature thresholds triggering shivering did not change in comparison with a placebo. Several studies have proven that core-to-peripheral redistribution of body temperature after general anesthetics is characterized by a decrease in core temperature during the first 20 to 30 minutes, and this alteration remained similar in the ondansetron group. The evidence above suggests that the effect of ondansetron in the prevention of PAS is irrelevant to core hypothermia. Conversely, Kelsaka et al. found that core temperature was preserved in the ondansetron group rather than the placebo group, but no one shared the same idea with them. Therefore, there is little evidence supporting temperature preservation as another antishivering mechanism.

Shivering differs between general anesthesia and neuraxial anesthesia. General anesthesia could impair central thermoregulation, while neuraxial anesthesia impairs both central and peripheral mechanisms.

### Intravenous amisulpride does not meaningfully prolong the QTc interval at doses effective for the management of postoperative nausea and vomiting [^115egx6f]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2021). High credibility.

Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) are significant issues in surgical patients, and additional treatment options are needed. Dopaminergic antiemetics have been popular for their efficacy, but their use has been limited by safety concerns, especially the potential for torsade de pointes arising from QT interval prolongation. Intravenous (IV) amisulpride, a dopamine D2 and D3 antagonist, has been shown to be effective at preventing and treating PONV at doses of 5 and 10 mg respectively. At 5 mg, it is not associated with clinically meaningful prolongation of the heart rate-corrected QT (QTc) interval. This study was designed to evaluate the QT effect of a 10-mg dose of amisulpride alone and when simultaneously co-administered with ondansetron, an antiemetic of a different class also known to prolong the QT interval.

- **Methods**: In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 3-period, crossover study, healthy male and female volunteers aged 18–65 years received IV, in a random sequence: (1) amisulpride 10 mg given twice, 2 hours apart; (2) amisulpride 10 mg and ondansetron 4 mg, given simultaneously; and (3) placebo.

- **Results**: Thirty subjects were enrolled, and 29 completed all 3 treatment periods. The largest mean placebo-corrected change-from-baseline QT interval, corrected for heart rate using Fridericia's formula (QTcF) (ΔΔQTcF), after the first and second amisulpride dose was 5.2 milliseconds (90% confidence interval, 3.53–6.96 milliseconds) and 8.0 milliseconds (90% CI, 5.49–10.58 milliseconds), respectively. After co-administration with ondansetron, the results indicated.

### The acute effect of tropisetron on ECG parameters in cancer patients [^112fLcXh]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2008). Low credibility.

The 5-hydroxytryptamine 3 receptor antagonists, including tropisetron, ondansetron, granisetron, and dolasetron, are agents used effectively for supportive care. They are utilized for the prevention and treatment of chemotherapy and radiotherapy-induced emesis. Despite their overall excellent safety profile, some electrocardiographic changes related to heart rate and repolarization have been reported. Ondansetron, granisetron, and dolasetron have been studied in this manner, but to our knowledge, there is no information about the cardiac side effects of tropisetron. In this study, we aimed to determine the acute effects of tropisetron on ECG parameters related to repolarization, heart rate, and systemic blood pressure.

Fifty-five cancer patients who received tropisetron for the prevention of acute chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting were enrolled in this single-center, prospective study. Standard 12-lead ECG recordings were performed at baseline and 30 minutes after tropisetron (5 mg given over 1 minute IV bolus) administration. P wave durations and corrected QT intervals were measured, and P wave dispersion and QTc dispersion were calculated.

In comparison with baseline, mean heart rate significantly decreased 30 minutes after the administration of tropisetron. Tropisetron did not result in a significant change in P wave duration, corrected QT interval, P dispersion, or QTc dispersion.

In this study, tropisetron did not show any ventricular and atrial arrhythmogenic effect due to repolarization abnormalities. It may only cause a slight decrease in heart rate.

### Prolongation of QTC interval after postoperative nausea and vomiting treatment by droperidol or ondansetron [^1126be5U]. Anesthesiology (2005). Low credibility.

At dosages above 0.1 mg/kg, droperidol induces a dose-dependent QTc interval prolongation. Although subject to controversy, low-dose droperidol has recently been suspected of inducing cardiac arrhythmias. Consequently, 5-hydroxytryptamine type 3 antagonists have become the first-line drug for managing postoperative nausea and vomiting. These drugs are also known to prolong the QTc interval at high dosages. This study describes QTc interval changes associated with postoperative nausea and vomiting treatment by droperidol or ondansetron at low doses.

- **Methods**: Eighty-five patients with postoperative nausea and vomiting were included in this prospective, single-blind study. Patients received either 0.75 mg intravenous droperidol (n = 43) or 4 mg intravenous ondansetron (n = 42). Electrocardiographic recordings were obtained before the administration of the antiemetic drug and then 1, 2, 3, 5, 10, and 15 minutes after. Electrocardiographic monitoring was maintained for 3 hours in eight patients in each group.

- **Results**: The QTc interval was prolonged (> 450 ms in men, > 470 ms in women) in 21% of the patients before antiemetic drug administration. This was significantly correlated with lower body temperature and longer duration of anesthesia. Compared with predrug QTc measurement, both antiemetics were associated with a significant QTc interval prolongation (P < 0.0001). The mean maximal QTc interval prolongation was 17 ± 9 ms after droperidol occurring at the second minute and 20 ± 13 ms after ondansetron at the third minute (both P < 0.0001). Compared with predrug measurement, the…

### Ondansetron [^113AmoCM]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

Ondansetron is a selective 5‑HT3 receptor antagonist. While its mechanism of action has not been fully characterized, ondansetron is not a dopamine‑receptor antagonist. Serotonin receptors of the 5‑HT3 type are present both peripherally on vagal nerve terminals and centrally in the chemoreceptor trigger zone of the area postrema. It is not certain whether ondansetron's antiemetic action is mediated centrally, peripherally, or in both sites. However, cytotoxic chemotherapy appears to be associated with the release of serotonin from the enterochromaffin cells of the small intestine. In humans, urinary 5‑hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5‑HIAA) excretion increases after cisplatin administration in parallel with the onset of emesis. The released serotonin may stimulate the vagal afferents through the 5‑HT3 receptors and initiate the vomiting reflex.

- **Pharmacodynamics**: In healthy subjects, single intravenous doses of 0.15 mg/kg of ondansetron had no effect on esophageal motility, gastric motility, lower esophageal sphincter pressure, or small intestinal transit time. Multiday administration of ondansetron has been shown to slow colonic transit in healthy subjects. Ondansetron has no effect on plasma-prolactin concentrations.

- **Cardiac electrophysiology**: QTc interval prolongation was studied in a double-blind, single-intravenous dose, placebo- and positive-controlled, crossover trial in 58 healthy subjects. The maximum mean (95% upper confidence bound) difference in QTcF from placebo after baseline correction was 19.5 (21.8) milliseconds and 5.6 (7.4) milliseconds.

### The pronociceptive effect of ondansetron in the setting of P-glycoprotein inhibition [^113komqZ]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2006). Low credibility.

Ondansetron is a potent antiemetic drug that acts through the inhibition of the 5HT3 receptors for serotonin. The minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) for isoflurane is not affected by systemic ondansetron; however, ondansetron is a substrate of P-glycoprotein, a transport pump expressed in the blood-brain barrier. Thus, we hypothesized that central nervous system concentrations of ondansetron might be reduced by the P-gp protein. As potent inhibitors of P-gp are in clinical trials to improve access of desirable chemotherapeutic and antibiotic drugs to the central nervous system, we studied the effect of ondansetron in the absence of extrusion by P-gp.

Normal rats were given lumbar intrathecal ondansetron or vehicle. P-gp knockout mice and wild-type controls were treated with systemic ondansetron in the presence and absence of clinically used P-gp inhibitors. Nociception was assessed as thermal hindpaw withdrawal latency, and immobility was assessed as isoflurane MAC.

- **Results**: In rats, intrathecal ondansetron (20 g) increased thermal pain sensitivity by 20.0% ± 5.8% (P < 0.01). Systemic ondansetron (2 mg/kg) increased pain sensitivity in P-gp knockout mice but had no effect in wild-type mice (P < 0.01). Systemic ondansetron had a small but statistically significant pronociceptive effect after treatment of wild-type mice with the P-gp inhibitor quinidine but not with cyclosporine or verapamil. Isoflurane MAC was not changed by intrathecal ondansetron in rats or systemically administered ondansetron in P-gp knockout mice. Intrathecal ondansetron can enhance thermal pain sensitivity.

Some directions for future research should be drawn from the meta-analysis. An adequate sample and comprehensive consideration of side effects should be included in future research. The effects of various dosages of ondansetron, anesthetic techniques, and surgical settings on postanesthesia shivering (PAS) should be explored. Furthermore, studies aimed at comparing ondansetron with other drugs should be conducted to evaluate the clinical and economic efficacy of ondansetron. Finally, the definition of PAS should be standardized.

### SPL drug information for ondansetron [^116Qpipt]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

When administering ondansetron PO, there are several warnings and precautions to consider:

- **Anaphylaxis, bronchospasm**: Use extreme caution in patients with hypersensitivity to selective 5-HT₃ receptor antagonists.
- **Exacerbation of phenylketonuria**: Be cautious in patients with phenylketonuria, as PO disintegrating tablets contain phenylalanine.
- **Masking symptoms of ileus, gastric distension**: Exercise caution in patients experiencing chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting or those who have undergone abdominal surgery.
- **Myocardial infarction**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as ondansetron has been associated with an increased risk of myocardial ischemia.
- **Prolonged QT interval**: Exercise caution in patients with electrolyte abnormalities, congestive heart failure, bradyarrhythmias, or those taking other QT-prolonging medications. Obtain ECG monitoring and avoid using ondansetron in patients with congenital long QT syndrome.
- **Serotonin syndrome**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as ondansetron has been associated with an increased risk of serotonin syndrome. This is especially pertinent in patients using other serotonergic drugs, such as SSRIs, serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, MAOIs, mirtazapine, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, and intravenous methylene blue.

### Ondansetron given intravenously attenuates arterial blood pressure drop due to spinal anesthesia: a double-blind, placebo-controlled study [^112zCDAt]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Side effects of spinal anesthesia include arterial hypotension and bradycardia. These effects may be induced by sympathetic nerve blockade as well as by the Bezold-Jarisch reflex, potentially mediated by peripheral serotonin receptors (5-HT(3) type). The aim of this study was to verify the hypothesis that the blockade of type 3 serotonin receptors by intravenous ondansetron administration might reduce hypotension and bradycardia induced by spinal anesthesia.

- **Methods**: Seventy-one patients participated in the study; 36 in the ondansetron group (receiving 8 mg intravenous ondansetron), and 35 in the placebo group (receiving isotonic NaCl solution). Measurements of heart rate and arterial blood pressure were taken every 5 minutes after spinal anesthesia was performed with 4 mL of 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine solution.

- **Results**: Decreases in mean, systolic, and diastolic arterial pressure as well as in heart rate, compared with baseline values, were observed in both groups. Minimal systolic and mean blood pressure values obtained over a 20-minute observation period were significantly higher in the ondansetron group. There were no significant differences in diastolic blood pressure and heart rate values between the groups.

- **Conclusions**: Ondansetron given intravenously attenuates the fall of systolic and mean blood pressure, but does not have an influence on diastolic blood pressure or heart rate.

### Ondansetron hydrochloride [^113HbmEz]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Inform patients that ondansetron injection may cause hypersensitivity reactions, including severe cases such as anaphylaxis and bronchospasm. Patients should report any signs and symptoms of hypersensitivity reactions, including fever, chills, rash, or breathing problems [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

- **QT prolongation**: Patients should be informed that ondansetron may cause serious cardiac arrhythmias, such as QT prolongation. They should be instructed to tell their healthcare provider immediately if they notice a change in their heart rate, feel lightheaded, or have a syncopal episode. The risk of developing severe cardiac arrhythmias like QT prolongation and Torsade de Pointes is higher in patients with:

	- A personal or family history of abnormal heart rhythms, such as congenital long QT syndrome
	- Medications that may cause electrolyte abnormalities, such as diuretics
	- Conditions such as hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia

Ondansetron injection should be avoided in these patients, as they may be more at risk for cardiac arrhythmias like QT prolongation and Torsade de Pointes [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The reactions have been chosen for inclusion due to a combination of their seriousness, frequency of reporting, or potential causal connection to ondansetron.

- **Cardiovascular**: Arrhythmias (including ventricular and supraventricular tachycardia, premature ventricular contractions, and atrial fibrillation), bradycardia, electrocardiographic alterations (including second-degree heart block, QT/QTc interval prolongation, and ST segment depression), palpitations, and syncope. Rarely and predominantly with intravenous ondansetron, transient ECG changes including QT/QTc interval prolongation have been reported [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

### Efficacy and safety of ondansetron in preventing postanesthesia shivering: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^115PJHsX]. BMC Anesthesiology (2014). High credibility.

A total of 114 potential studies (17 from PubMed and 97 from EMBASE) were obtained. The detailed screening flow was shown in Figure 1. After screening the titles and abstracts, 103 studies were excluded due to duplication or lack of available data. Five additional studies were excluded through full-text screening, with two being duplicates, two focusing on ondansetron's therapeutic effects on PAS, and one investigating the drug's effect on the shivering threshold. The detailed characteristics of the six included studies in this meta-analysis are presented in Table 1.

- **Study selection**: Figure 1 shows the flow chart of study selection, detailing the inclusion and exclusion process.

- **Characteristics of included studies**: Table 1 outlines the characteristics of the six studies included in this meta-analysis. Overall, 533 subjects participated in these trials, with 235 receiving ondansetron, 213 receiving a placebo, and 85 receiving meperidine. Ondansetron was administered in dosages of either 4 mg or 8 mg across the studies, while meperidine was given at a standardized dose of 0.4 mg/kg in three studies. The trial drugs were predominantly administered before anesthesia, with one instance occurring at the end of surgery.

The pooled estimate suggested that ondansetron potentially affects PAS prevention (RR = 0.43, 95% CI, 0.27–0.70), as shown in Figure 2, with moderate heterogeneity evidence (I² = 61.1%, P = 0.025). Results of the subgroup analyses, presented in Table 2, demonstrated that ondansetron significantly reduces PAS risk. Additionally, the adverse effects and comparison with meperidine for ondansetron were analyzed, albeit with limited test power. Compared to the placebo, there was no significant association with ondansetron.

### Ondansetron hydrochloride [^1162WuTP]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **Serotonin syndrome**: The development of serotonin syndrome has been reported with 5-HT3 receptor antagonists alone. Most reports have been associated with concomitant use of serotonergic drugs, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), monoamine oxidase inhibitors, mirtazapine, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, and intravenous methylene blue. Some of the reported cases were fatal. Serotonin syndrome occurring with an overdose of ondansetron alone has also been reported. The majority of reports of serotonin syndrome related to 5-HT3 receptor antagonist use occurred in a post-anesthesia care unit or an infusion center.

Symptoms associated with serotonin syndrome may include the following combination of signs and symptoms: mental status changes (e.g. agitation, hallucinations, delirium, and coma), autonomic instability (e.g. tachycardia, labile blood pressure, dizziness, diaphoresis, flushing, hyperthermia), neuromuscular symptoms (e.g. tremor, rigidity, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, incoordination), seizures, with or without gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g. nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). Patients should be monitored for the emergence of serotonin syndrome, especially with concomitant use of ondansetron and other serotonergic drugs. If symptoms of serotonin syndrome occur, discontinue ondansetron and initiate supportive treatment. Patients should be informed of the increased risk of serotonin syndrome, especially if ondansetron is used concomitantly with other serotonergic drugs.

### Ondansetron has similar clinical efficacy against both nausea and vomiting [^114MyZ6G]. Anaesthesia (2009). Low credibility.

Ondansetron is widely believed to prevent postoperative vomiting more effectively than nausea. We analyzed data from 5,161 patients undergoing general anesthesia who were randomly stratified to receive a combination of six interventions, one of which was 4 mg ondansetron versus placebo. For the purpose of this study, a 20% difference in the relative risks for the two outcomes was considered clinically relevant. Nausea was reduced from 38% (969/2,585) in the control group to 28% (715/2,576) in the ondansetron group, corresponding to a relative risk of 0.74, or a relative risk reduction of 26%. Vomiting was reduced from 17% (441/2,585) to 11% (293/2,576), corresponding to a relative risk of 0.67, or a relative risk reduction of 33%. The relative risks of 0.67 and 0.74 were clinically similar, and the difference between them did not reach statistical significance. We thus conclude that ondansetron prevents postoperative nausea and postoperative vomiting equally well.

### Effect of ramosetron on QTc interval: a randomised controlled trial in patients undergoing off-pump coronary artery bypass surgery [^113MUrsp]. BMC Anesthesiology (2016). High credibility.

Ramosetron is a relatively new 5-hydroxytryptamine three receptor antagonist with a higher binding affinity and more prolonged duration of action compared to ondansetron. The present study was performed to evaluate the effects of ramosetron on QTc interval and possible cardiovascular adverse effects in patients undergoing cardiac surgery.

- **Method**: A total of 114 patients who underwent off-pump coronary artery bypass surgery were enrolled in this randomized placebo-controlled trial. Patients were allocated into two groups that received an intravenous injection of 0.3 mg ramosetron or normal saline during the induction of anaesthesia. QTc intervals were measured at the following time points:
	- **Preoperative**: Before the operation
	- **Intraoperative**: 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 10, 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120, and 240 minutes after injection of ramosetron or normal saline
	- **Postoperative**: At the end of the operation and on postoperative day 1

- **Results**:
	- **QTc interval differences**: There were no differences in the mean QTc interval between groups at every time point.
	- **Maximal change in QTc interval**: The maximal change in QTc interval during surgery was higher in the ramosetron group than in the placebo group (25.1 ± 22.0 vs. 17.5 ± 14.5 ms, 95% CI 0.34–14.78, P = 0.040).
	- **QTc interval increase > 60 ms**: More patients in the ramosetron group experienced this increase (5 vs. 0, 95% CI 1.6–18.0, P = 0.021).
	- **Cardiovascular complications**: There were no significant differences in cardiovascular complications.

- **Conclusions**: Ramosetron administered during the induction of anaesthesia may affect maximal change in QTc interval during off-pump coronary artery bypass surgery. Ramosetron should be used with caution in high-risk patients for developing Torsades de Pointes.

### Does ondansetron modify sympathectomy due to subarachnoid anesthesia? Meta-analysis, meta-regression, and trial sequential analysis [^111NcKE3]. Anesthesiology (2016). High credibility.

Disagreement among many underpowered studies has led to an equivocal understanding of the efficacy of the 5-HT3 antagonist ondansetron in preventing the consequences of sympathectomy after subarachnoid anesthesia. The authors assessed the efficacy of ondansetron with respect to the overall quality and statistical power of the meta-analyses.

- **Methods**: The authors used a standard and a newer method of meta-analysis, trial sequential analysis (TSA), to estimate adjusted confidence intervals (CIs) based on how much information has been accrued. They also used random-effects meta-analyses techniques, small trial bias assessment, selection models, sensitivity analyses, and the grading of recommendations on assessment, development, and evaluation system. The results from these techniques were compared, and the importance of considering these factors was discussed.

- **Results**: Fourteen randomized placebo-controlled trials (1,045 subjects) were identified and analyzed. Using conventional meta-analyses, the authors determined that ondansetron was associated with a reduction in the incidence of hypotension (relative risk = 0.62 [95% CI, 0.46 to 0.83], P = 0.001; TSA-adjusted CI, 0.34 to 1.12; I² = 60%, P = 0.002) and bradycardia (relative risk = 0.44 [95% CI, 0.26 to 0.73], P = 0.001; TSA-adjusted CI, 0.05 to 3.85; I² = 0%, P = 0.84). However, the authors found indications of bias among these trials. TSAs demonstrated that the meta-analysis lacked adequate information size and did not achieve statistical significance when adjusted for sparse data and repetitive testing.

### Ondansetron hydrochloride [^113bRTrd]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Patient counseling information includes several critical aspects regarding the usage of ondansetron hydrochloride.

- **Hypersensitivity reactions**: Inform patients that ondansetron tablets may cause hypersensitivity reactions, some as severe as anaphylaxis and bronchospasm. Instruct patients to immediately report any signs and symptoms of hypersensitivity reactions, including fever, chills, rash, or breathing problems to their healthcare provider [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

- **QT prolongation**: Inform patients that ondansetron tablets may cause serious cardiac arrhythmias, such as QT prolongation. Instruct patients to tell their healthcare provider immediately if they perceive a change in their heart rate, feel lightheaded, or experience a syncopal episode [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

- **Drug interactions**: Instruct patients to report the use of all medications, especially apomorphine, to their healthcare provider. Concomitant use of apomorphine and ondansetron may cause a significant drop in blood pressure and loss of consciousness. Advise patients of the possibility of serotonin syndrome with concomitant use of ondansetron and another serotonergic agent, such as medications to treat depression and migraines. Advise patients to seek immediate medical attention if the following symptoms occur: changes in mental status, autonomic instability, neuromuscular symptoms with or without gastrointestinal symptoms [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

- **Myocardial ischemia**: Inform patients that ondansetron tablets may cause myocardial ischemia. Advise patients to seek immediate medical help if any symptoms suggestive of myocardial ischemia occur.

The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling:

- **Hypersensitivity reactions**: See warnings and precautions (5.1).
- **QT prolongation**: See warnings and precautions (5.2).
- **Serotonin syndrome**: See warnings and precautions (5.3).
- **Myocardial ischemia**: See warnings and precautions (5.4).

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared with rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The following adverse reactions have been reported in clinical trials of patients treated with ondansetron, the active ingredient of ondansetron. A causal relationship to therapy with ondansetron was unclear in many cases.

For the prevention of chemotherapy‑induced nausea and vomiting, the most common adverse reactions reported in greater than or equal to 4% of 300 adults receiving a single 24-mg dose of ondansetron orally in two trials for the prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with highly emetogenic chemotherapy (cisplatin greater than or equal to 50 mg/m²) were headache (11%) and diarrhea (4%). The most common adverse reactions reported in four trials in adults for the prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with moderately emetogenic chemotherapy (primarily cyclophosphamide-based regimens) are shown in Table 3.

### Randomized controlled trial comparing ondansetron and placebo for the reduction of spinal anesthesia-induced hypotension during elective cesarean delivery in Egypt [^116udL15]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2016). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of prophylactic ondansetron on spinal anesthesia-induced hypotension and bradycardia among patients undergoing elective cesarean deliveries.

A prospective, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial enrolled patients aged 20 to 40 years scheduled for elective cesarean delivery under spinal anesthesia between January 1, 2015, and January 31, 2016, at Menoufia University Hospital, Egypt. Patients were randomized to receive intravenous ondansetron 4 mg in 10 mL of saline or 10 mL of saline. Participants and investigators were masked to group assignments. The primary outcomes measured were systolic and diastolic blood pressure, mean arterial pressure, and heart rate, assessed at baseline, at 10-minute intervals up to 60 minutes, and at 2 hours. Per-protocol analyses were performed including patients who delivered under spinal anesthesia.

The analyses included 50 patients in each group. Decreases in systolic blood pressure were reduced among patients receiving ondansetron at all time points (P < 0.05). Among patients who received ondansetron, mean arterial pressure was higher immediately and 30 minutes after spinal anesthesia (P < 0.05), and higher heart rates were recorded immediately, 20 minutes, and 50 minutes after anesthesia (P < 0.05). Additionally, the incidence of nausea (P = 0.020) and vomiting (P = 0.031) was lower.

In conclusion, prophylactic intravenous ondansetron significantly reduced hypotension and heart-rate fluctuations among patients undergoing elective cesarean deliveries under spinal anesthesia.

### Ondansetron hydrochloride [^113yv8Mq]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Ondansetron injection is a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist indicated for the prevention of nausea and vomiting. It is specifically used for:

- **Prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with initial and repeat courses of emetogenic cancer chemotherapy**: Ondansetron injection is indicated for the prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with initial and repeat courses of emetogenic cancer chemotherapy, including high-dose cisplatin. It is approved for patients aged 6 months and older.

- **Prevention of postoperative nausea and/or vomiting**: Ondansetron injection is indicated for the prevention of postoperative nausea and/or vomiting. Routine prophylaxis is not recommended for patients in whom there is little expectation that nausea and/or vomiting will occur postoperatively. In cases where it must be avoided postoperatively, ondansetron injection is recommended even when the incidence is low. For those who do not receive prophylactic ondansetron injection and experience postoperative nausea and/or vomiting, ondansetron injection may be administered to prevent further episodes. It is approved for patients aged 1 month and older.

### Ondansetron and the risk of cardiac arrhythmias: a systematic review and postmarketing analysis [^116EhuEN]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

To explore the risk of cardiac arrhythmias associated with ondansetron administration, we conducted a postmarketing analysis and systematically reviewed the published literature, grey literature, manufacturer's database, Food and Drug Administration Adverse Events Reporting System, and the World Health Organization Individual Safety Case Reports Database (VigiBase). Eligible cases described a documented (or perceived) arrhythmia within 24 hours of ondansetron administration. The primary outcome was arrhythmia occurrence temporally associated with the administration of a single, oral ondansetron dose. Secondary objectives included identifying all cases associating ondansetron administration (any dose, frequency, or route) to an arrhythmia.

- **Results**:
	- **Primary**: No reports describing an arrhythmia associated with single oral ondansetron dose administration were identified.
	- **Secondary**: Sixty unique reports were identified. The route of administration was predominantly intravenous (80%). A significant medical history or concomitant use of a QT-prolonging medication was identified in 83% of reports. Approximately one-third of cases occurred in patients receiving chemotherapeutic agents, many of which are known to prolong the QT interval. An additional third involved administration to prevent postoperative vomiting.

Evidence does not support routine ECG and electrolyte screening before single oral ondansetron dose administration to individuals without known risk factors for arrhythmias.

### Intravenous ondansetron and the QT interval in adult emergency department patients: An observational study [^115iR6QT]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Ondansetron is known to cause QT interval prolongation, but this effect and its clinical significance have not been prospectively studied in adult emergency department (ED) patients. The primary objective was to determine the mean maximal corrected QT interval (QTc) prolongation after intravenous (IV) administration of 4 mg of ondansetron; the secondary objective was to report any serious adverse cardiac electrical events.

This prospective, observational, single-center cohort study was conducted between 2012 and 2013 in an academic, military hospital ED. Adult patients ordered to receive 4 mg of IV ondansetron were eligible for the study. A six-lead electrocardiogram was recorded at baseline and every 2 minutes after ondansetron administration for 20 minutes. The QTc was calculated using the Bazett formula. Serious adverse cardiac electrical events (nonsinus rhythm, severe bradycardia, and sudden cardiac death) were also recorded.

Twenty-two adult ED patients were enrolled. Ondansetron caused a mean prolongation of the QTc by 20 ms (95% confidence interval [CI] = 14 to 26 ms), with a mean proportion change from baseline of 5.2% (95% CI = 3.8% to 6.6%). There were zero (95% CI = 0 to 13%) reported serious adverse cardiac electrical events.

While QTc prolongation does occur in adult ED patients receiving IV ondansetron, the clinical impact is questionable.

### The effect of intravenous ondansetron on QT interval in the emergency department [^115PRXBM]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

Ondansetron, a 5HT3 receptor antagonist, is commonly used in emergency departments to treat nausea and vomiting. In 2011, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a warning that this medicine may cause QT prolongation, potentially leading to life-threatening arrhythmias. The objective of this study was to characterize the QT interval prolongation associated with ondansetron use in the emergency department.

- **Methods**: This was a prospective, observational cohort study of adult patients who presented to the emergency department during a one-year period and were treated with intravenous ondansetron. We investigated the QT prolongation associated with dosages. ECGs were obtained before the medication and 5, 15, and 30 minutes after IV drug administration. Every QT measurement was recorded and compared to the zero point. The severity of drug-induced QT prolongation was determined according to the recommendations of the International Conference on Compliance (ICH). QTc prolongation was categorized as 'negligible' (20 ms), 'potential concern' (> 30 ms), or 'definitely worrying' (> 60 ms).

- **Results**: Of the 435 patients enrolled in the study, 60% (261 patients) were female, and the mean age was 39 (± 18). The QT prolongation peaked at the fifth minute and remained consistent at the fifteenth and thirty-first minutes. The maximum prolongation of the mean QT duration occurred at the fifth minute (7.9 ± 18.1 ms). No patient revealed any problems with cardiac conduction. The prolonged QT interval was not related to the dose of ondansetron, but QT measurements were.

### Effects of preoperative serotonin-receptor-antagonist administration in spinal anesthesia-induced hypotension: A randomized, double-blind comparison study of ramosetron and ondansetron [^115H8mrP]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

The adverse effects of spinal anesthesia (SA) include arterial hypotension and bradycardia. The aim of this study was to compare the effects of two type 3 serotonin receptor antagonists in SA-induced adverse effects. Specifically, we assessed whether ramosetron was more effective than ondansetron in reducing SA-induced decreases in blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR).

A total of 117 patients undergoing orthopedic surgery and receiving SA were intravenously administered 0.3 mg of ramosetron (n = 39, group R), 4 mg of ondansetron (n = 39, group O4), or 8 mg of ondansetron (n = 39, group O8). Systolic BP (SBP), diastolic BP (DBP), mean BP (MBP), HR, and the lowest SBP, DBP, MBP, and HR values were measured preoperatively (baseline) and intraoperatively. The incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting, the need for rescue antiemetics, the amount of patient-controlled analgesia consumption, and pain score in the first 48 hours after surgery were determined.

Baseline values did not significantly differ among the three groups. After SA, SBP, DBP, MBP, and HR were lower than their baseline values in all three groups. The differences between the baseline and the lowest values were significantly less in group R than in groups O4 and O8 with respect to SBP (P < 0.001), DBP (P = 0.001), and MBP (P < 0.001), and less in group R than in group O4 with respect to HR (P = 0.032). Intergroup differences were not significant for postoperative nausea and vomiting, the need for rescue antiemetics, patient-controlled analgesia consumption, or pain score.

### Absence of QT prolongation after administration of a 24-mg bimodal-release ondansetron pill (RHB-102) [^113VW3TZ]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Prospective data evaluating the effect of ondansetron on the corrected QT (QTc) interval is lacking in emergency department clinical use. As part of a randomized trial of a 24-mg bimodal-release ondansetron (RHB-102) pill, the effect of RHB-102 compared to placebo on QTc change was tested.

- **Methods**: This was a planned safety outcome analysis within a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. The trial compared the effects of RHB-102 among patients ≥ 12 years who presented to 21 centers with symptoms of acute gastroenteritis. Patients with an initial baseline electrocardiogram as well as a follow-up electrocardiogram 4 hours later were included in the analysis. The safety endpoint for this analysis was the change from baseline in QTc interval at 4 hours, the median time at which ondansetron serum level peaks.

- **Results**: A total of 147 patients were included with a mean baseline QTc in the RHB-102 and placebo arms of 410 and 406 ms, respectively. There was no difference in the change in QTc at 4 hours post-study drug administration between the RHB-102 (+4, 95% CI 1–8 ms) and placebo group (+5, 95% CI 1–9 ms). In the RHB-102 arm, 6.6% of patients had a QTc change > 30 ms, and in the placebo arm, 3.6% (p = 0.48). No patient in either arm had a QTc change > 60 ms after study drug administration.

- **Conclusion**: In patients with normal baseline QTc, 24-mg bimodal-release ondansetron did not prolong the QTc in comparison to placebo.

### Ondansetron [^113WRsKq]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

- **Hypersensitivity reactions**: Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis and bronchospasm, have been reported in patients who have exhibited hypersensitivity to other selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonists. If hypersensitivity reactions occur, discontinue use of ondansetron; treat promptly per standard of care and monitor until signs and symptoms resolve [see Contraindications (4)].

- **QT prolongation**: Electrocardiogram (ECG) changes, including QT interval prolongation, have been seen in patients receiving ondansetron. In addition, postmarketing cases of Torsade de Pointes have been reported in patients using ondansetron. Avoid ondansetron in patients with congenital long QT syndrome. ECG monitoring is recommended in patients with electrolyte abnormalities (e.g. hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia), congestive heart failure, bradyarrhythmias, or patients taking other medicinal products that lead to QT prolongation [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].

### Ondansetron [^111MTuEF]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

Inform patients about potential hypersensitivity reactions that may occur with ondansetron, including severe reactions such as anaphylaxis and bronchospasm. Patients should be instructed to immediately report any signs and symptoms of hypersensitivity, such as fever, chills, rash, or breathing difficulties, to their healthcare provider [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Inform patients that ondansetron may lead to serious cardiac arrhythmias, specifically QT prolongation. Patients should be advised to contact their healthcare provider immediately if they notice changes in their heart rate, experience lightheadedness, or have a syncopal episode [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

Instruct patients to report all medication usage, notably apomorphine, to their healthcare provider. The concurrent use of apomorphine and ondansetron can cause a significant drop in blood pressure and loss of consciousness. Patients should also be warned about the risk of serotonin syndrome when ondansetron is used with other serotonergic agents, such as those used to treat depression and migraines. Immediate medical attention should be sought if symptoms such as changes in mental status, autonomic instability, or neuromuscular symptoms occur, with or without gastrointestinal symptoms [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

### Minimal effective weight-based dosing of ondansetron to reduce hypotension in cesarean section under spinal anesthesia: a randomized controlled superiority trial [^112hV8gu]. BMC Anesthesiology (2018). Low credibility.

In this study, we found that a weight-based dose of prophylactic ondansetron did not influence the incidence of maternal hypotension. The results of this study were consistent with two other studies, but were in contrast with others. Two recent systematic reviews showed ondansetron reduced the incidence of hypotension (relative risk ratio [RR] = 0.63, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.45–0.88, and RR = 0.67, 95% CI: 0.54–0.83, respectively) and bradycardia (RR = 0.31, 95% CI: 0.19–0.50, and RR = 0.49, 95% CI: 0.28–0.87, respectively) after spinal anesthesia in cesarean section, even though a low quality of evidence was reported. However, the minimal effective weight-based dosing of ondansetron in parturients was not determined.

### Ondansetron [^116f19NM]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of ondansetron. Since these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

- **Cardiovascular**: Arrhythmias (including ventricular and supraventricular tachycardia, premature ventricular contractions, and atrial fibrillation), bradycardia, electrocardiographic alterations (including second-degree heart block, QT/QTc interval prolongation, and ST segment depression), palpitations, and syncope. Rarely, and predominantly with intravenous ondansetron, transient ECG changes, including QT interval prolongation, have been reported. Myocardial ischemia was reported predominately with intravenous administration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

- **General**: Flushing. Rare cases of hypersensitivity reactions, sometimes severe (e.g. anaphylactic reactions, angioedema, bronchospasm, shortness of breath, hypotension, laryngeal edema, stridor), have also been reported. Laryngospasm, shock, and cardiopulmonary arrest have occurred during allergic reactions in patients receiving injectable ondansetron.

- **Hepatobiliary**: Liver enzyme abnormalities.

- **Lower respiratory**: Hiccups.

- **Neurology**: Oculogyric crisis, appearing alone, as well as with other dystonic reactions.

- **Skin**: Urticaria, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis.

- **Eye disorders**: Cases of transient blindness, predominantly during intravenous administration, have been reported.

### Efficacy and safety of ondansetron in preventing postanesthesia shivering: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^113Ne1WE]. BMC Anesthesiology (2014). Low credibility.

Powell et al. found that ondansetron was associated with a dose-dependent reduction in shivering; however, this effect was not observed in the pooled data. In one study, the incidence of shivering was 10% in individuals weighing about 52 kg using low-dose ondansetron (4 mg), while Powell et al. found the incidence was 8% in those weighing around 76 kg with high-dose ondansetron (8 mg). It is presumed that the various weights of the subjects might mask the dose-dependent effect.

- **Comparative analysis**: When compared to other drugs, ondansetron is notably absent from the hemodynamic effects in the treatment and prevention of postanesthesia shivering (PAS), significantly contributing to its safety. The result indicating no difference in bradycardia between ondansetron and placebo is acceptable despite the limited sample size.

Additionally, two recent studies demonstrated that ondansetron is safe for pregnant women and fetuses. Apart from the primary outcome of PAS and the side effect of bradycardia, other side effects were mentioned but were not suitable for quantitative analysis. None indicated a significant risk of convulsion, myoclonus, rash, pruritus, headache, pain, hypotension, sedation, nausea, or vomiting.
