## Question

What is the goal of PTT for dvt

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what the goal of PTT (activated partial thromboplastin time) is in the treatment of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what PTT actually measures and why it is used with unfractionated heparin. Then, I should verify the historical and current therapeutic targets and how they were derived. Next, I will examine the limitations of PTT and whether anti-Xa monitoring is preferred. After that, I need to consider special populations and contexts, including pediatrics, obesity, and catheter-directed thrombolysis. Finally, I will synthesize a concise, clinically actionable answer that aligns with guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the basics: PTT is a clotting assay that reflects intrinsic pathway activity and is commonly used to monitor unfractionated heparin (UFH) because UFH exerts its anticoagulant effect via antithrombin-mediated inhibition of thrombin and factor Xa, which prolongs PTT in a dose-dependent fashion. This is why we titrate UFH infusions to a PTT-based therapeutic range in DVT treatment [^ce07ecea].

> Wait, let me verify the therapeutic target and its origin. Historically, many programs used a PTT ratio of 1.5–2.5 times the control, but that fixed-ratio approach is problematic because different aPTT reagents yield widely varying heparin concentrations at the same ratio. Modern practice calibrates the local aPTT therapeutic range to correspond to heparin concentrations of 0.3–0.7 IU/mL by anti-Xa activity, which typically translates to roughly 60–85 seconds in many adult laboratories, though the exact seconds vary by reagent and must be locally validated [^ce07ecea] [^d628adf6].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about PTT being the best monitor. I should double-check the evidence that aPTT correlates poorly with anti-Xa levels and that anti-Xa monitoring achieves therapeutic anticoagulation faster and with fewer adjustments. Indeed, multiple studies show discordance between aPTT and anti-Xa, with faster time to therapeutic anti-Xa and similar or better clinical outcomes in some cohorts, supporting a shift toward anti-Xa–guided UFH monitoring when available, especially in complex patients or when aPTT responses are atypical [^d7b51315] [^78efb267] [^48d58408].

> I need to ensure I address special populations. In pediatrics, aPTT correlates poorly with anti-Xa activity and age-related variation is substantial; pediatric guidelines recommend either aPTT or anti-Xa monitoring but emphasize consistency and local validation, with many centers preferring anti-Xa to avoid under- or over-anticoagulation. Neonates and infants often have higher aPTT for the same anti-Xa level, so relying on aPTT alone risks overdosing [^186978ad] [^3f1a54b3]. In obesity, aPTT may be less reliable and anti-Xa monitoring is frequently favored to guide UFH dosing. In cirrhosis, baseline aPTT is often prolonged, further limiting aPTT utility and pushing practice toward anti-Xa or LMWH strategies [^cd1f00a9].

> Next, I should review procedural contexts. During catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT) for iliofemoral DVT, quality guidelines recommend frequent hematocrit, platelet count, and PTT checks at least every 12 hours, with subtherapeutic heparin dosing (about 1.2–1.7 times control PTT) during the lytic infusion to balance bleeding risk; this is a scenario where PTT remains pragmatically useful even if anti-Xa is available, underscoring that the "goal" is context-specific [^dbbe6125].

> Let me synthesize the clinical answer now. The goal of PTT in DVT is to titrate UFH to a therapeutic anticoagulant effect that corresponds to heparin concentrations of 0.3–0.7 IU/mL by anti-Xa, which in many adult laboratories approximates an aPTT of about 60–85 seconds, but the exact local therapeutic aPTT range must be validated against anti-Xa activity. This titration aims to prevent thrombus extension and recurrence while minimizing bleeding, recognizing that aPTT is an imperfect surrogate and that anti-Xa monitoring may outperform aPTT in achieving timely, stable therapeutic anticoagulation in many patients [^ce07ecea] [^d628adf6] [^d7b51315] [^78efb267].

> But wait, what if UFH is not the agent of choice? I should confirm that contemporary guidelines prefer DOACs or LMWH for most patients with DVT, where routine PTT monitoring is not required. UFH is reserved for specific indications such as renal failure, hemodynamic instability, or when rapid reversibility is needed, which explains why PTT "goals" are less central in modern DVT care pathways even though they remain essential when UFH is used [^5bfa2b68] [^cfe153f3].

---

The goal of PTT in DVT is to **monitor and titrate unfractionated heparin (UFH)** to a therapeutic range that balances efficacy and bleeding risk [^ce07ecea]. The therapeutic PTT target is **typically 1.5–2.5 times the baseline** or about 60–85 seconds, but this range must be locally validated against anti-Xa levels (0.3–0.7 IU/mL) because PTT reagents vary widely [^d628adf6]. Maintaining PTT in this range reduces thrombus extension and recurrence while minimizing bleeding; however, anti-Xa monitoring is increasingly preferred when available due to better correlation with heparin levels and faster time to therapeutic anticoagulation [^d7b51315] [^78efb267].

---

## Clinical rationale for PTT monitoring in DVT

PTT monitoring is essential for UFH because of its **variable pharmacokinetics and dose-response**; it helps ensure adequate anticoagulation to prevent thrombus extension and recurrence while avoiding bleeding [^ce07ecea]. UFH is commonly used in DVT when rapid onset and reversibility are needed, such as in renal impairment, obesity, or when transitioning to oral anticoagulation [^5bfa2b68].

---

## Therapeutic PTT range for DVT

The **traditional therapeutic PTT range** is 1.5–2.5 times the baseline or approximately 60–85 seconds, but this must be locally validated against anti-Xa levels (0.3–0.7 IU/mL) because PTT reagents vary widely [^d628adf6]. Some centers use a narrower target of 60–85 seconds to improve consistency and safety [^notfound].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting PTT monitoring

PTT-guided UFH dosing is supported by clinical evidence showing reduced recurrence and bleeding when PTT is maintained in the therapeutic range [^notfound]. However, **many patients spend substantial time outside the therapeutic range**, which increases recurrence and bleeding risk [^99ab1b29].

---

## Limitations and challenges of PTT monitoring

PTT monitoring has several limitations:

- **Variability**: PTT reagents and instruments vary, causing inconsistent results and requiring local validation [^d628adf6].
- **Delayed achievement**: Many patients take 24–48 hours to reach therapeutic PTT, risking under-anticoagulation [^99ab1b29].
- **Poor correlation**: PTT correlates poorly with heparin levels, especially in obesity, renal impairment, or thrombocytosis [^48d58408].

---

## Alternative monitoring methods

Anti-Xa assays are increasingly used to overcome PTT limitations. Anti-Xa monitoring **correlates more closely with heparin levels**, achieves therapeutic anticoagulation faster, and requires fewer dose adjustments than PTT [^d7b51315] [^78efb267]. However, anti-Xa assays are not universally available and may be more expensive.

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines emphasize **individualized monitoring** and local validation of PTT ranges. When available, anti-Xa monitoring is preferred, especially in obesity, renal impairment, or when PTT responses are atypical [^notfound]. For LMWH, routine monitoring is not required, but anti-Xa levels may be checked in special populations (e.g. obesity, renal impairment, pregnancy) [^7adf178e].

---

## Clinical outcomes associated with PTT monitoring

Maintaining PTT in the therapeutic range is associated with **reduced recurrence and bleeding**; however, prolonged time outside the range increases adverse events. Anti-Xa monitoring may improve time in therapeutic range and reduce adverse outcomes, though evidence is mixed [^78efb267].

---

## Summary of PTT goals in DVT management

| **Clinical goal** | **Ptt target range** | **Evidence level** |
|-|-|-|
| Prevent thrombus extension and recurrence | 1.5–2.5 times baseline or 60–85 seconds | High |
| Minimize bleeding complications | Maintain therapeutic PTT consistently | High |
| Ensure adequate anticoagulation | Locally validated PTT range aligned to anti-Xa 0.3–0.7 IU/mL | High |
| Alternative monitoring | Anti-Xa assay (0.3–0.7 IU/mL) | Moderate |

---

The goal of PTT in DVT is to **guide UFH dosing** to a locally validated therapeutic range that prevents recurrence while minimizing bleeding; anti-Xa monitoring is increasingly preferred when available due to better accuracy and faster achievement of therapeutic anticoagulation [^d7b51315] [^78efb267].

### What is the optimal duration of treatment for DVT? An update on evidence-based medicine of treatment for DVT [^8502c141]. Seminars in Vascular Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Venous thromboembolism, including deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism, represent a major source of morbidity and mortality today. Incidence of DVT is estimated to be 56 to 160/100,000 population per year. Systemic anticoagulation with low molecular weight heparin or unfractionated heparin with initiation of oral vitamin K antagonist therapy has been shown to be beneficial in preventing pulmonary embolism and reducing extension and recurrence of DVT. The duration of anticoagulation following an episode of DVT is determined by the greatest predictors of recurrence. These include the presence of reversible risk factors, nonreversible risk factors, and no risk factors (idiopathic or unprovoked DVT). Short durations of anticoagulation are only appropriate for calf DVTs in patients with reversible risk factors. Patients with nonreversible risk factors, such as malignancy and certain inherited thrombophilias with a strong family history of venous thromboembolism will require lifelong anticoagulation. Those with proximal DVT due to reversible risk factors require 3 to 6 months of anticoagulation. Patients with idiopathic DVT require reassessment of risk-to-benefit ratio of hemorrhage from oral vitamin K antagonist therapy compared to reducing risk of recurrence and frequently require prolonged oral anticoagulant therapy. Monitoring with d-dimer and serial ultrasounds may offer an individualized approach to therapy.

### Treatment options for deep venous thrombosis [^fe3d2567]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

Once the diagnosis of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) has been established the focus shifts to management of the disease. The goals of acute treatment of DVT are several: arrest growth of the thrombus, dissolve or remove the thrombus, and prevent embolizations of the thrombus. Although these goals have remained constant, the initial management of DVT has undergone a series of evolutions during the past decade, affecting both acute treatment and disposition decisions. As this article discusses, emergency medicine is at the cutting edge of these changes.

### Suboptimal monitoring and dosing of unfractionated heparin in comparative studies with low-molecular-weight heparin [^246f2dfd]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Site-specific validation of the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) therapeutic range is required to ensure administration of the optimal dose of unfractionated heparin. Therapeutic ranges of 1.5 to 2.5 times the control value are subtherapeutic for most modern aPTT reagents.

Purpose

To audit the appropriateness of aPTT monitoring in clinical trials comparing unfractionated heparin and low-molecular-weight heparin in patients with venous thromboembolism.

Data Sources

Search of PubMed database from 1984 to 2001.

Study Selection

Randomized, controlled trials that compared unfractionated and low-molecular-weight heparin for the treatment of venous thromboembolism.

Data Extraction

Use of unvalidated and potentially suboptimal therapeutic ranges for aPTT in patients assigned to receive unfractionated heparin.

Data Synthesis

Fifteen studies met inclusion criteria. Only 3 studies used a validated aPTT therapeutic range, and 11 studies used a range that included aPTT values 1.5 times the control value. Ten studies reported unfractionated heparin doses, and 7 of these documented a reduction to less than 30 000 U/d in response to aPTT results.

Conclusions

Most studies monitored unfractionated heparin inappropriately. This shortcoming could be responsible for the reduced efficacy of unfractionated heparin in clinical trials.

### Changing paradigms in the management of deep vein thrombosis [^2ba3bff4]. British Journal of Haematology (2015). Low credibility.

In adults diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis (DVT), challenges remain in the management of the acute event whilst remaining alert to long-term morbidity. The addition of non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) to the pharmacopoeia represents the first of a number of recent advancements in the management of DVT. Worldwide, uptake of these agents has been avid, although drug selection, reversal and chronic treatment effects continue to be controversial areas. Multi-centre studies to evaluate the impact of NOACs on long-term outcomes, including thrombosis recurrence and post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS), are ongoing. Validation of tools capable of predicting PTS would enable patient selection for early aggressive intervention, such as local thrombolysis. Such interventional strategies are gaining momentum as initial approaches and would benefit from large randomized controlled trials.

### Quality improvement guidelines for the treatment of lower-extremity deep vein thrombosis with use of endovascular thrombus removal [^dbbe6125]. Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2014). Medium credibility.

Lower-extremity DVT thrombolysis — prevention of bleeding emphasizes technical access, dose limits, and monitoring. It should be confirmed that venous access was routinely obtained with US guidance and a micropuncture needle, and the popliteal vein may be used as the preferred access site. When recombinant tissue plasminogen activator is used, weight-based dosing at 0.01 mg/kg/h (not to exceed 1.0 mg/h) is recommended. Monitoring should include blood draws for hematocrit, platelet count, and PTT at least every 12 hours, and serial fibrinogen monitoring during CDT may help to prevent complications. It should be confirmed that arterial punctures and intramuscular injections did not occur during thrombolysis, and that thrombolytic progress was assessed by venography at least every 24 hours. For unfractionated heparin, subtherapeutic dosing — 1.2–1.7 times the control PTT — was reasonably effective and safe in one randomized trial, and low molecular weight heparin at twice-daily, weight-based, FDA-approved dosing may also be a safe method during CDT/PCDT though data are limited. One small study suggests argatroban may also be safe, but heparin-based therapy should be preferred in patients without contraindications until larger studies are available.

### Treatment of distal deep vein thrombosis [^771dbf23]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The treatment of distal (below the knee) deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is not clearly established. Distal DVT can either be treated with anticoagulation, or monitored with close follow-up to detect progression to the proximal veins (above the knee), which requires anticoagulation. Proponents of this monitoring strategy base their decision to withhold anticoagulation on the fact that progression is rare and most people can be spared from potential bleeding and other adverse effects of anticoagulation.

Objectives

To assess the effects of different treatment interventions for people with distal (below the knee) deep vein thrombosis (DVT).

Search Methods

The Cochrane Vascular Information Specialist searched the Cochrane Vascular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and CINAHL databases and World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov trials registers to 12 February 2019. We also undertook reference checking to identify additional studies.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) for the treatment of distal DVT.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected trials and extracted data. We resolved disagreements by discussion. Primary outcomes of interest were recurrence of venous thromboembolism (VTE), DVT and major bleeding and follow up ranged from three months to two years. We performed fixed-effect model meta-analyses with risk ratio (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE.

Main Results

We identified eight RCTs reporting on 1239 participants. Five trials randomised participants to anticoagulation for up to three months versus no anticoagulation. Three trials compared anticoagulation treatment for different time periods. Anticoagulant compared to no intervention or placebo for distal DVT treatment Anticoagulation with a vitamin K antagonist (VKA) reduced the risk of recurrent VTE during follow-up compared with participants receiving no anticoagulation (RR 0.34, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.77; 5 studies, 496 participants; I² = 3%; high-certainty evidence), and reduced the risk of recurrence of DVT (RR 0.25, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.67; 5 studies, 496 participants; I² = 0%; high-certainty evidence). There was no clear effect on risk of pulmonary embolism (PE) (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.18 to 3.59; 4 studies, 480 participants; I² = 0%; low-certainty evidence). There was little to no difference in major bleeding with anticoagulation compared to placebo (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.13 to 4.62; 4 studies, 480 participants; I² = 26%; low-certainty evidence). There was an increase in clinically relevant non-major bleeding events in the group treated with anticoagulants (RR 3.34, 95% CI 1.07 to 10.46; 2 studies, 322 participants; I² = 0%; high-certainty evidence). There was one death, not related to PE or major bleeding, in the anticoagulation group. Anticoagulation for three months or more compared to anticoagulation for six weeks for distal DVT treatment Three RCTs of 736 participants compared three or more months of anticoagulation with six weeks of anticoagulation. Anticoagulation with a VKA for three months or more reduced the incidence of recurrent VTE to 5.8% compared with 13.9% in participants treated for six weeks (RR 0.42, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.68; 3 studies, 736 participants; I² = 50%; high-certainty evidence). The risk for recurrence of DVT was also reduced (RR 0.32, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.64; 2 studies, 389 participants; I² = 48%; high-certainty evidence), but there was probably little or no difference in PE (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.19 to 5.88; 2 studies, 389 participants; I² = 0%; low-certainty evidence). There was no clear difference in major bleeding events (RR 3.42, 95% CI 0.36 to 32.35; 2 studies, 389 participants; I² = 0%; low-certainty evidence) or clinically relevant non-major bleeding events (RR 1.76, 95% CI 0.90 to 3.42; 2 studies, 389 participants; I² = 1%; low-certainty evidence) between three months or more of treatment and six weeks of treatment. There were no reports for overall mortality or PE and major bleeding-related deaths.

Authors' Conclusions

Our review found a benefit for people with distal DVT treated with anticoagulation therapy using VKA with little or no difference in major bleeding events although there was an increase in clinically relevant non-major bleeding when compared to no intervention or placebo. The small number of participants in this meta-analysis and strength of evidence prompts a call for more research regarding the treatment of distal DVT. RCTs comparing different treatments and different treatment periods with placebo or compression therapy, are required.

TITLE Comparison of subcutaneous low-molecular-weight heparin with intravenous standard heparin in proximal deep-vein thrombosis.

AUTHORS Prandoni P, Lensing AW, Büller HR, et al.

JOURNAL The Lancet. 1992;339(8791):441–445. PMID: 1346817

Thirty years ago, The Lancet published the results of a randomized clinical trial comparing low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) with unfractionated heparin (UFH) for the treatment of proximal deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The study was carried out at a single Italian center and enrolled a total of 170 patients over 5 years (from 1986 to 1991).

At that time, the standard treatment for DVT and pulmonary embolism (PE) consisted of UFH, administered by a continuous intravenous infusion for approximately 10 days, followed by vitamin K antagonists. This treatment relied on laboratory measurements of the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) and prothrombin time/International Normalized Ratio and on consequent dose adjustments. Not uncommonly, patients were hospitalized (and confined to bed) for 2 weeks or more.

In the 1980s, LMWH were developed and proposed as an alternative to UFH for the prevention and treatment of thromboembolic disorders. LMWH offered, for the first time, the possibility of administering an anticoagulant drug at fixed doses, without the need for laboratory monitoring. However, the first studies comparing LMWH with UFH in the treatment of venous thrombosis still used the laboratory to determine the correct dose of LMWH and all studies published before the Italian trial used surrogate markers to assess therapeutic efficacy.

It was about time to test LMWH without laboratory support and to assess the occurrence of symptomatic events, recurrence or extension of DVT and bleeding, to reflect clinical practice. Needless to say, the idea of administering an anticoagulant drug to a patient with an extensive thrombosis and at potential risk of fatal PE without any information on treatment intensity from the laboratory was not as easy to accept as we may find it now.

Section 6.2 UFH dosing and monitoring evidence in outpatients: Weight-adjusted subcutaneous unfractionated heparin (SC UFH) monitored with activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) compared with subcutaneous low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) in three RCTs (n = 937) showed recurrent VTE (OR, 1.13; 95% CI, 0.52–2.46), major bleeding (OR, 1.28; 95% CI, 0.42–4.09), and death (OR, 1.34; 95% CI, 0.62–2.93); in one RCT comparing weight-adjusted SC UFH to weight-based LMWH without monitoring, SC UFH was administered as an initial dose of 333 units/kg followed by 250 units/kg bid, with subsequent UFH dosing kept constant.

### Comparing anti-factor Xa and activated partial thromboplastin levels for monitoring unfractionated heparin [^d7b51315]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2019). Medium credibility.

Background: Lab tests such as activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) or anti-factor Xa (anti-Xa) levels are typically used to monitor intravenous unfractionated heparin (IV heparin), with recent evidence suggesting that anti-Xa levels may provide a more accurate measure of anticoagulation. Objective: The Lexington Veterans Affairs Health Care System transitioned from using aPTT to anti-Xa levels in January 2017. This study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of this change. Methods: This was a retrospective cohort study comparing all patients receiving IV heparin per protocol for at least 24 hours from August 1, 2016, to January 31, 2017 (aPTT group), and February 1, 2017, to July 31, 2017 (anti-Xa group). The primary objective was a comparison of IV heparin doses required to achieve goal range between the 2 cohorts. Secondary objectives included a comparison of time to therapeutic goal, percentage of time within goal range, number of rate changes until therapeutic goal, and adverse outcomes, such as number of bleeds. Results: A total of 155 patients were included in this study. Significantly higher IV heparin doses were required to achieve therapeutic goal in the anti-Xa group, despite significantly fewer IV heparin rate changes required. Anti-Xa monitoring was not associated with an increased risk of adverse events. Conclusion and Relevance: Significantly higher IV heparin doses were required to achieve therapeutic anti-Xa levels after transitioning from an aPTT-based protocol in the largely unstudied veteran population. However, the transition from aPTT to anti-Xa monitoring appears safe and efficacious in these patients.

### Clinical outcomes with unfractionated heparin monitored by anti-factor Xa vs. activated partial thromboplastin time [^78efb267]. American Journal of Hematology (2019). Medium credibility.

Anti-factor Xa (anti-Xa) monitoring of unfractionated heparin (UFH) is associated with less time to achieve therapeutic anticoagulation compared to the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT). However, it is unknown whether clinical outcomes differ between these methods of monitoring. The aim of this research was to compare the rate of venous thrombosis and bleeding events in patients that received UFH monitored by anti-Xa compared to the aPTT. A retrospective review of electronic health records identified adult patients that received UFH given intravenously (IV) for ≥ 2days, with either anti-Xa or aPTT monitoring at an academic tertiary care hospital. This was a pre/post study design conducted between January 1 to December 30, 2014 (aPTT), and January 1 to December 30, 2016 (anti-Xa). All UFH adjustments were based on institutional nomograms. The primary outcome was venous thrombosis and the secondary outcome was bleeding, both of which occurred between UFH administration and discharge from the index hospitalization. A total of 2500 patients were in the anti-Xa group and 2847 patients aPTT group. Venous thrombosis occurred in 10.2% vs 10.8% of patients in the anti-Xa and aPTT groups, respectively (P = 0.49). Bleeding occurred in 33.7% vs 33.6% of patients in the anti-Xa and aPTT groups, respectively (P = 0.94). Anti-Xa monitoring was not an independent predictor of either outcome in multivariate logistic regression analyses. Our study found no difference in clinical outcomes between anti-Xa and aPTT-based monitoring of UFH IV.

### Deep venous thrombosis [^5d79265a]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Deep venous thrombosis (DVT) is a frequently encountered condition that is often diagnosed and treated in the outpatient setting. Risk stratification is helpful and recommended in the evaluation of DVT. An evidence-based diagnostic approach is discussed here. Once diagnosed, the mainstay of DVT treatment is anticoagulation. The specific type and duration of anticoagulation depend upon the suspected etiology of the venous thromboembolism, as well as risks of bleeding and other patient comorbidities. Both specific details and a standardized approach to this vast treatment landscape are presented.

### Activated partial thromboplastin time versus antifactor Xa heparin assay in monitoring unfractionated heparin by continuous intravenous infusion [^bbdb5d79]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Unfractionated heparin (UFH) has been used clinically for 5 decades. Despite being a cornerstone of anticoagulation, UFH is limited by its unpredictable pharmacokinetic profile, which makes close laboratory monitoring necessary. The most common methods for monitoring UFH are the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) and antifactor Xa heparin assay (anti-Xa HA), but both present challenges, and the optimal method to monitor UFH remains unclear.

Objective

To compare the performance of the aPTT with the anti-Xa HA for efficiency and safety of monitoring intravenous UFH infusions.

Methods

This was a single-center, retrospective, observational cohort study conducted in an 852-bed academic medical center.

Results

One hundred patients receiving intravenous UFH for a variety of indications were enrolled in the study; 50 were assigned to each group. The mean (SD) time to achieve therapeutic anticoagulation was significantly less in the anti-Xa HA group compared with the aPTT group (28 [16] vs 48 [26] hours, p < 0.001). In addition, a greater percentage of anti-Xa HA patients compared to aPTT patients achieved therapeutic anticoagulation at 24 hours (OR 3.5; 95% CI 1.5 to 8.7) and 48 hours (OR 10.9; 95% CI 3.3 to 44.2). Patients in the anti-Xa HA group also had more test values within the therapeutic range (66% vs 42%, p < 0.0001). A significant difference was seen between the 2 groups in the number of aPTT or anti-Xa HA tests performed per 24 hours (p < 0.0001) and number of infusion rate changes per 24 hours (p < 0.01), both favoring the anti-Xa HA group.

Conclusions

Monitoring intravenous UFH infusions with the anti-Xa HA, compared to the aPTT, achieves therapeutic anticoagulation more rapidly, maintains the values within the goal range for a longer time, and requires fewer adjustments in dosage and repeated tests.

### Quality improvement guidelines for the treatment of lower-extremity deep vein thrombosis with use of endovascular thrombus removal [^976f8cb1]. Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2014). Medium credibility.

Risk of complications and pre-procedure evaluations for CDT — avoidance criteria and testing are described: Because most thrombolytic DVT interventions are nonurgent, treatment should be avoided in patients with a hemorrhagic disorder, an anatomic lesion in a critical location that is prone to bleeding, or a strong contraindication to anticoagulant therapy, and a list of contraindications to CDT is provided; before thrombolysis, patients with malignancies that frequently metastasize to the central nervous system should undergo brain imaging to exclude metastatic lesions; the patient should be assessed for overall clinical stability, life expectancy, and amenability to undergo a procedure with conscious sedation; and hematocrit, platelet count, International Normalized Ratio, PTT, creatinine, and pregnancy test (in women with childbearing potential) should be known before therapy initiation.

### How we diagnose and treat deep vein thrombosis [^8429fe94]. Blood (2002). Low credibility.

Making a diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) requires both clinical assessment and objective testing because the clinical features are nonspecific and investigations can be either falsely positive or negative. The initial step in the diagnostic process is to stratify patients into high-, intermediate-, or low-risk categories using a validated clinical model. When the clinical probability is intermediate or high and the venous ultrasound result is positive, acute symptomatic DVT is confirmed. Similarly, when the probability is low and the ultrasound result is normal, DVT is ruled out. A low clinical probability combined with a negative D-dimer result can also be used to rule out DVT, thereby obviating the need for ultrasonography. In contrast, when the clinical assessment is discordant with the results of objective testing, serial venous ultrasonography or venography is required to confirm or refute a diagnosis of DVT. Once a patient is diagnosed with an acute DVT, low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) is the agent of choice for initial therapy and oral anticoagulant therapy is the standard for long-term secondary prophylaxis. Therapy should continue for at least 3 months; the decision to continue treatment beyond 3 months is made by weighing the risks of recurrent thrombosis and anticoagulant-related bleeding, and is influenced by patient preference. Screening for associated thrombophilia is not indicated routinely, but should be performed in selected patients whose clinical features suggest an underlying hypercoagulable state. Several new anticoagulants with theoretical advantages over existing agents are undergoing evaluation in phase 3 studies in patients with venous thromboembolism.

Prothrombin time (PT), partial thromboplastin time (PTT), and factor Xa.

Subcutaneous LMWH and fixed dosed heparin require laboratory monitoring. For patients on therapeutic UFH, serial monitoring of (PTT; also known as APTT) or factor Xa is suggested. The benefit of monitoring IV heparin once a therapeutic threshold has been exceeded is not well defined.

Anticoagulation Forum and American College of Chest Physicians both recommend monitoring anti-Xa levels to monitor UFH because of baseline artefactual abnormalities in PTT and a potential for heparin resistance. None of the guidelines recommend dosing of LMWHs based on anti-Xa levels given lack of evidence on outcomes for thrombosis or bleeding. Body weight–adjusted doses for LMWH appear safer, which may be particularly effective in overweight patients. Elevated PT or PTT is not a contraindication to thromboprophylaxis in the absence of active bleeding. A platelet count < 25 × 10⁹ /L or fibrinogen < 0.5 g/L constitutes a bleeding risk, warranting holding of standard dose VTE prophylaxis, whereas therapeutic anticoagulation should be withheld if platelet count < 50 × 10⁹ /L or fibrinogen < 1.0 g/L.

The role of serial hemoglobin monitoring in COVID-19 patients on therapeutic anticoagulation is poorly defined.

We found no data from LMICs regarding the diagnosis of heparin induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). Speculative explanations for this finding include limited availability of laboratory assays for serological confirmation of HIT, expense associated with using nonheparin anticoagulants, and a lack of awareness of the guidelines.

Availability, feasibility, affordability, and safety.

A study from Nigeria identified the inability to monitor as a primary reason for reduced clinician adherence to anticoagulation guidelines. In a separate multicenter survey from six southeastern Nigerian tertiary hospitals, most respondents were able to recognize PT and APTT, but not anti-Xa assay, as laboratory monitoring tools for anticoagulation therapy. This finding correlated with heparin and warfarin as the most commonly administered anticoagulants among respondents.

D -dimer testing might not be readily available in some LMICs and likely would incur a higher cost, although specific pricing in various LMIC environments remains unclear. Early COVID-19 studies suggest wide use of these tests in China, an upper middle-income country.

### How should we determine length of anticoagulation after proximal deep vein thrombosis of the lower limbs? [^a13a9083]. British Journal of Haematology (2009). Low credibility.

The current approach for deciding the duration of vitamin K antagonist (VKA) treatment after an episode of venous thrombo-embolism (VTE) is mainly based on the characteristic of the index event (3 months or longer in case of unknown/persistent risk factors, 3 months or less in case of removable causes). However, the length of anticoagulation should be tailored on the patient's risk for recurrent thrombosis as well as for bleeding, but such 'time for decision' is often unclear and the optimal duration of VKA remains debatable. The presence of persistent residual vein thrombosis and increased D-dimer levels after stopping therapy are predictors for recurrent deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Management strategies based on these parameters have been demonstrated to optimize the decision for VKA duration, as they establish the patient's intrinsic risk for recurrent events. This annotation discusses current practice and upcoming approaches regarding the length of VKA treatment after a first episode of DVT.

### Anticoagulation in patients with cirrhosis: caught between a rock-liver and a hard place [^cd1f00a9]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

To review current literature for anticoagulation in patients with cirrhosis and provide a summary of the effects of cirrhosis on the coagulation cascade, therapeutic monitoring through interpretation of antifactor Xa (anti-Xa), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), and international normalized ratio (INR) as well as current prophylaxis and treatment recommendations in cirrhotic patients.

Methods

A systematic electronic literature search was conducted in PubMed using the key termsanticoagulation, warfarin, low-molecular-weight heparin(LMWH), unfractionated heparin(UFH), target-specific oral anticoagulants, deep-vein thrombosis(DVT), pulmonary embolism(PE), portal vein thrombosis(PVT), venous thromboembolism, anti-Xa, activated partial thromboplastin time, anticoagulation therapeutic monitoring, coagulopathy, coagulation cascade, chronic liver disease, cirrhosis, anddecompensated liver disease

Study Selection

Studies written in the English language from January 2000 to December 2015 were considered for this review article. All search results were reviewed, and the relevance of each article was determined by authors independently.

Conclusions

Patients with cirrhosis are at higher risk for both bleeding and thrombosis-related complications. Cirrhosis affects production of both procoagulant and anticoagulant factors, thus resulting in increased INR and aPTT levels and decreased anti-Xa levels. LMWH is the treatment of choice for the prevention and treatment of DVT/PE/PVT in patients with cirrhosis, and monitoring with anti-Xa levels for dose adjustment is not recommended. UFH is an alternative in cirrhotic patients for shorter-term use and in cases of severe renal dysfunction and/or hemodynamic instability. Cirrhotic patients on anticoagulation therapy should be monitored closely for signs and symptoms of bleeding and thrombosis.

### Do new oral anticoagulants require laboratory monitoring? The clinician point of view [^b546e627]. Thrombosis Research (2012). Low credibility.

Although no laboratory monitoring is needed for new anticoagulants, the measurement of their activity is required in special clinical situations. Standardised tests have been developed for rivaroxaban and dabigatran which allow the measurement of the patient's response to the drug at Cmax (2 to 3 hours after intake) or at trough (before repeated administration). The results can be expressed in mg per mL of plasma and compared to the expected concentrations. The influence of the new anticoagulants of coagulation assays has been determined. Several clinical cases of major bleeding have been reported and a severe coagulopathy was found in these patients (prolonged PT and aPTT, increased drug concentration in plasma). These observations raise the question regarding the potential benefit of laboratory coagulation monitoring from time to time. Trials are needed to determine the relationship of assay results with bleeding or thrombotic complications. Pros and Cons laboratory measurements are discussed.

### Approach to outcome measurement in the prevention of thrombosis in surgical and medical patients: antithrombotic therapy and prevention of thrombosis, 9th ed: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^fd12e43a]. Chest (2012). Medium credibility.

Comparisons of alternative antithrombotic agents — limitations of surrogate outcomes arise because randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have "used asymptomatic DVT by mandatory venography as the primary outcome measure or as a component thereof", and "any improvement in efficacy with any one agent was accompanied by an increase in bleeding", providing limited information on "the trade-off between benefits and risks in patient-important events". The surrogate rationale is that most thrombi start as calf vein thrombi that may progress to PE, and that "a reduction in asymptomatic venous thrombosis by antithrombotic prophylaxis is paralleled by a similar reduction in symptomatic VTE".

### Antithrombotic therapy for venous thromboembolic disease: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines (8th edition) [^dba6bced]. Chest (2008). Low credibility.

This chapter about treatment for venous thromboembolic disease is part of the American College of Chest Physicians Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guidelines (8th Edition). Grade 1 recommendations are strong and indicate that the benefits do or do not outweigh risks, burden, and costs. Grade 2 suggests that individual patient values may lead to different choices (for a full understanding of the grading, see "Grades of Recommendation" chapter). Among the key recommendations in this chapter are the following: for patients with objectively confirmed deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE), we recommend anticoagulant therapy with subcutaneous (SC) low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), monitored IV, or SC unfractionated heparin (UFH), unmonitored weight-based SC UFH, or SC fondaparinux (all Grade 1A). For patients with a high clinical suspicion of DVT or PE, we recommend treatment with anticoagulants while awaiting the outcome of diagnostic tests (Grade 1C). For patients with confirmed PE, we recommend early evaluation of the risks to benefits of thrombolytic therapy (Grade 1C); for those with hemodynamic compromise, we recommend short-course thrombolytic therapy (Grade 1B); and for those with nonmassive PE, we recommend against the use of thrombolytic therapy (Grade 1B). In acute DVT or PE, we recommend initial treatment with LMWH, UFH or fondaparinux for at least 5 days rather than a shorter period (Grade 1C); and initiation of vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) together with LMWH, UFH, or fondaparinux on the first treatment day, and discontinuation of these heparin preparations when the international normalized ratio (INR) is ≥ 2.0 for at least 24 h (Grade 1A). For patients with DVT or PE secondary to a transient (reversible) risk factor, we recommend treatment with a VKA for 3 months over treatment for shorter periods (Grade 1A). For patients with unprovoked DVT or PE, we recommend treatment with a VKA for at least 3 months (Grade 1A), and that all patients are then evaluated for the risks to benefits of indefinite therapy (Grade 1C). We recommend indefinite anticoagulant therapy for patients with a first unprovoked proximal DVT or PE and a low risk of bleeding when this is consistent with the patient's preference (Grade 1A), and for most patients with a second unprovoked DVT (Grade 1A). We recommend that the dose of VKA be adjusted to maintain a target INR of 2.5 (INR range, 2.0 to 3.0) for all treatment durations (Grade 1A). We recommend at least 3 months of treatment with LMWH for patients with VTE and cancer (Grade 1A), followed by treatment with LMWH or VKA as long as the cancer is active (Grade 1C). For prevention of postthrombotic syndrome (PTS) after proximal DVT, we recommend use of an elastic compression stocking (Grade 1A). For DVT of the upper extremity, we recommend similar treatment as for DVT of the leg (Grade 1C). Selected patients with lower-extremity (Grade 2B) and upper-extremity (Grade 2C). DVT may be considered for thrombus removal, generally using catheter-based thrombolytic techniques. For extensive superficial vein thrombosis, we recommend treatment with prophylactic or intermediate doses of LMWH or intermediate doses of UFH for 4 weeks (Grade 1B).

### American Society of Hematology / International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis 2024 updated guidelines for treatment of venous thromboembolism in pediatric patients [^3f1a54b3]. Blood Advances (2025). High credibility.

Unfractionated heparin (UFH) dosing and monitoring in children are outlined, including an initial loading dose range, therapeutic target, and a monitoring recommendation. A loading dose of 75 to 100 IU/kg is reported to achieve therapeutic activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) in most children, and the maintenance dose needed to reach the adult therapeutic range corresponding to an anti-factor Xa (anti-FXa) level of 0.35 to 0.7 is higher in neonates than older children and is gestational age dependent. Both aPTT and anti-FXa are used clinically, but studies show poor correlation and no superiority for predicting thrombosis or bleeding; therefore, we suggest that clinicians consistently use 1 test to monitor patients on UFH anticoagulation.

### Study details | NCT00790335 | Acute venous thrombosis: thrombus removal with adjunctive catheter-directed thrombolysis… [^63e089e9]. ClinicalTrials (2008). Low credibility.

Study Overview Activase, the study drug, is a fibrinolytic drug that is indicated for use in acute myocardial infarction, acute ischemic stroke, and acute massive pulmonary embolism in adults. Previous studies have established the ability of rt-PA to lyse venous thrombus in patients with deep vein thrombosis, and suggest that successful rt-PA mediated thrombolysis can prevent the post-thrombotic syndrome, a morbid, late complication of DVT that occurs in nearly 50% of patients. rt-PA is delivered directly into venous thrombus using a catheter/device which is embedded within the thrombus by a physician under imaging guidance. This method of rt-PA delivery, pharmacomechanical catheter-directed intrathrombus thrombolysis, is thought to be safer, more effective, and more efficient than previous methods. The question of whether PCDT using rt-PA improves long-term DVT patient outcomes with acceptable risk and cost has not yet been addressed.

The rationale for performing the ATTRACT Trial is based upon:

- the major burden of PTS on DVT patients and the U. S. healthcare system
- the association between rapid clot lysis and prevention of PTS
- the proven ability of rt-PA to dissolve venous thrombus in proximal DVT
- recent advances in CDT methods which may lower bleeding risk
- the major clinical controversy on whether CDT should be routinely used for first-line DVT therapy.
- Age less than 16 years or greater than 75 years.
- Symptom duration > 14 days for the DVT episode in the index leg.
- **In the index leg**: established PTS, or previous symptomatic DVT within the last 2 years.
- **In the contralateral leg**: symptomatic acute DVT a) involving the iliac and/or common femoral vein; or b) for which thrombolysis is planned as part of the initial therapy.
- Limb-threatening circulatory compromise.
- Pulmonary embolism with hemodynamic compromise.
- Inability to tolerate PCDT procedure due to severe dyspnea or acute systemic illness.
- Allergy, hypersensitivity, or thrombocytopenia from heparin, rt-PA, or iodinated contrast, except for mild-moderate contrast allergies for which steroid pre-medication can be used.

### Approach to outcome measurement in the prevention of thrombosis in surgical and medical patients: antithrombotic therapy and prevention of thrombosis, 9th ed: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^bf21c496]. Chest (2012). Medium credibility.

Venous thromboembolism (VTE) outcome estimation — strategy 3 (baseline risk from observational studies without surveillance, relative effect from RCT combined end points) begins with identifying observational studies of symptomatic VTE without venographic or ultrasound surveillance and then applying relative risk reductions from RCTs using the combined symptomatic and asymptomatic deep vein thrombosis (DVT) end point. Advantages are that baseline risks come from real-world populations, are not subject to biases from treating asymptomatic events or misattributing symptoms after discovering venographic DVT, and can be reasonably precise with large samples; a key disadvantage is the persisting assumption that treatment effects are identical for symptomatic and asymptomatic events. The authors judge that the advantages outweigh disadvantages only if large observational studies have a low risk of bias and specify prophylaxis exposure, ideally reporting results separately for those receiving and not receiving prophylaxis; such studies are rarely available.

### UNBLOCK: an open-label, dose-finding, pharmacokinetic and safety study of bivalirudin in children with deep vein thrombosis [^dce7d8d7]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Direct thrombin inhibitors offer potential advantages over unfractionated heparin but have been poorly studied in children.

Objectives

To determine appropriate dosing of bivalirudin in children and adolescents and the relationship between activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) and plasma bivalirudin concentration.

Patients/Methods

The UNBLOCK (UtilizatioN of BivaLirudin On Clots in Kids) study was an open-label, single-arm, dose-finding, pharmacokinetic, safety and efficacy study of bivalirudin for the acute treatment of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in children aged 6 months to 18 years. Drug initiation consisted of a bolus dose (0.125 mg kg⁻¹) followed by continuous infusion (0.125 mg kg h⁻¹). Dose adjustments were based on the APTT, targeting a range of 1.5–2.5 times each patient's baseline APTT. Safety was assessed by specific bleeding endpoints and efficacy by repeat imaging at 48–72 h and 25–35 days.

Results

Eighteen patients completed the study. Following the bolus dose and the initial infusion rate, most patients' APTT values were within the target range. The infusion rate bivalirudin correlated more closely with drug concentration than the APTT. At 48–72 h, nine (50%) patients had complete or partial thrombus resolution, increasing to 16 (89%) at 25–35 days. No major and one minor bleeding event occurred.

Conclusions

Bivalirudin demonstrated reassuring safety and noteworthy efficacy in terms of early clot resolution in children and adolescents with DVT. Although a widely available and familiar monitoring tool, the APTT correlates poorly with plasma bivalirudin concentration, possibly limiting its utility in managing pediatric patients receiving bivalirudin for DVT.

### Acute treatment of venous thromboembolism [^5bfa2b68]. Blood (2020). Medium credibility.

All patients with venous thromboembolism (VTE) should receive anticoagulant treatment in the absence of absolute contraindications. Initial anticoagulant treatment is crucial for reducing mortality, preventing early recurrences, and improving long-term outcome. Treatment and patient disposition should be tailored to the severity of clinical presentation, to comorbidities, and to the potential to receive appropriate care in the outpatient setting. Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) used in fixed doses without laboratory monitoring are the agents of choice for the treatment of acute VTE in the majority of patients. In comparison with conventional anticoagulation (parenteral anticoagulants followed by vitamin K antagonists), these agents showed improved safety (relative risk [RR] of major bleeding, 0.61; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.45–0.83) with a similar risk of recurrence (RR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.77–1.06). Vitamin K antagonists or low molecular weight heparins are still alternatives to DOACs for the treatment of VTE in specific patient categories such as those with severe renal failure or antiphospholipid syndrome, or cancer, respectively. In addition to therapeutic anticoagulation, probably less than 10% of patients require reperfusion by thrombolysis or interventional treatments; those patients are hemodynamically unstable with acute pulmonary embolism, and a minority of them have proximal limb-threatening deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The choice of treatment should be driven by the combination of evidence from clinical trials and by local expertise. The majority of patients with acute DVT and a proportion of selected hemodynamically stable patients with acute pulmonary embolism can be safely managed as outpatients.

### Methodology for the American Society of Hematology VTE guidelines: current best practice, innovations, and experiences [^9677e7ad]. Blood Advances (2020). High credibility.

Proximal deep venous thrombosis (DVT) health-outcome descriptors — upper leg severe, moderate, and mild presentations are defined across symptoms, time horizon, testing and treatment, and consequences. Severe DVT notes symptoms in the entire leg, a time horizon that will persist for months and will slowly improve, and consequences that often include long‑lasting pain and swelling, and sometimes a blood clot travelling to the lungs (a pulmonary embolism) and death; treatment may be administered in the hospital or at home and typically includes administration of blood thinners using a small tube inserted in your vein, injections or pills, with long‑lasting treatment often required. Moderate DVT will persist for months but improve over that time, and consequences may include long‑lasting pain and swelling in the leg, and rarely a blood clot travelling to the lungs (a pulmonary embolism) and death. Mild DVT will persist for weeks but improve over that time, and consequences rarely include long‑lasting pain and swelling in the leg, and very rarely a blood clot travelling to the lungs (a pulmonary embolism) and death.

14.4	Treatment of Deep Vein Thrombosis with or without Pulmonary Embolism

In a multicenter, parallel group study, 900 patients with acute lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT) with or without pulmonary embolism (PE) were randomized to an inpatient (hospital) treatment of either (i) enoxaparin sodium 1.5 mg/kg once a day subcutaneously, (ii) enoxaparin sodium 1 mg/kg every 12 hours subcutaneously, or (iii) heparin intravenous bolus (5000 IU) followed by a continuous infusion (administered to achieve an aPTT of 55 to 85 seconds). A total of 900 patients were randomized in the study and all patients were treated. Patients ranged in age from 18 to 92 years (mean age 60.7 years) with 54.7% men and 45.3% women. All patients also received warfarin sodium (dose adjusted according to PT to achieve an International Normalization Ratio [INR] of 2.0 to 3.0), commencing within 72 hours of initiation of enoxaparin sodium or standard heparin therapy, and continuing for 90 days. Enoxaparin sodium or standard heparin therapy was administered for a minimum of 5 days and until the targeted warfarin sodium INR was achieved. Both enoxaparin sodium regimens were equivalent to standard heparin therapy in reducing the risk of recurrent venous thromboembolism (DVT and/or PE). The efficacy data are provided below (see Table 21).

### American Society of Hematology / International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis 2024 updated guidelines for treatment of venous thromboembolism in pediatric patients [^186978ad]. Blood Advances (2025). High credibility.

Unfractionated heparin (UFH) — therapeutic range and monitoring in children: The therapeutic range used in pediatrics is largely extrapolated from adults, recommending an activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) that reflects "a heparin level by protamine titration of 0.2 to 0.4 IU/mL or an anti–factor Xa (anti–FXa) level of 0.35 to 0.7 IU/mL", noting that this "has yet to be confirmed by RCTs". Foundational adult data linked recurrent venous thromboembolism (VTE) risk to failure to achieve "an aPTT ratio of ∼1.5 times the control value" with correlation to "0.2 to 0.4 IU/mL by protamine titration". For monitoring in children, "UFH monitoring using the aPTT titrated to an anti-FXa assay result of 0.35 to 0.7 IU/mL, is associated with significant age-related variation", and "Infants and children can have significantly higher aPTT compared with adult reference ranges". The guideline notes that "Most laboratories do not adjust aPTT therapeutic ranges based on age", and that "pediatric studies report a poor correlation between aPTT and anti-FXa activity", with "some pediatric institutions" using anti-FXa monitoring for UFH.

### American Society of Hematology 2020 guidelines for management of venous thromboembolism: treatment of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism [^dd897b46]. Blood Advances (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Venous thromboembolism (VTE), which includes deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), occurs in ∼1 to 2 individuals per 1000 each year, corresponding to ∼300000 to 600000 events in the United States annually.

Objective

These evidence-based guidelines from the American Society of Hematology (ASH) intend to support patients, clinicians, and others in decisions about treatment of VTE.

Methods

ASH formed a multidisciplinary guideline panel balanced to minimize potential bias from conflicts of interest. The McMaster University GRADE Centre supported the guideline development process, including updating or performing systematic evidence reviews. The panel prioritized clinical questions and outcomes according to their importance for clinicians and adult patients. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach was used to assess evidence and make recommendations, which were subject to public comment.

The panel agreed on 28 recommendations for the initial management of VTE, primary treatment, secondary prevention, and treatment of recurrent VTE events.

Conclusions

Strong recommendations include the use of thrombolytic therapy for patients with PE and hemodynamic compromise, use of an international normalized ratio (INR) range of 2.0 to 3.0 over a lower INR range for patients with VTE who use a vitamin K antagonist (VKA) for secondary prevention, and use of indefinite anticoagulation for patients with recurrent unprovoked VTE. Conditional recommendations include the preference for home treatment over hospital-based treatment for uncomplicated DVT and PE at low risk for complications and a preference for direct oral anticoagulants over VKA for primary treatment of VTE.

### Effectiveness of a calculation-free weight-based unfractionated heparin nomogram with anti-Xa level monitoring compared with activated partial thromboplastin time [^37de837f]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Accurate monitoring of intravenous unfractionated heparin (UFH) is essential to mitigate the risk of adverse drug events associated with dosing errors. Although recent data support anti-factor Xa (anti-Xa) monitoring preferentially over activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) to improve time to therapeutic anticoagulation, the utility of incorporating anti-Xa monitoring with a calculation-free weight-based UFH nomogram has not been formally evaluated.

Objective

The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the time to therapeutic anticoagulation of a calculation-free weight-based UFH nomogram integrated with anti-Xa monitoring versus a historical control of aPTT monitoring utilizing manual dose calculations.

Methods

This was a retrospective analysis of patients with anti-Xa monitoring and a novel calculation-free weight-based UFH nomogram compared with a historical control with aPTT monitoring and manual calculations.

Results

A total of 103 patients in the aPTT cohort and 100 patients in the anti-Xa cohort were analyzed. The anti-Xa cohort achieved goal therapeutic target 3.8 hours sooner than the aPTT cohort (P = 0.03). Patients with anti-Xa monitoring required 1 fewer adjustment per 2.5 patient-days of UFH with the venous thromboembolism nomogram (P = 0.02). Patients in the aPTT cohort required more infusion interruptions because of supratherapeutic values (P = 0.007) and boluses because of subtherapeutic values (P = 0.044). There were no differences in rates of thromboembolism, major bleeding, or clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding between the cohorts.

Conclusion and Relevance

This study demonstrated that anti-Xa UFH monitoring integrated with a calculation-free nomogram results in faster time to therapeutic anticoagulation and fewer dose adjustments compared with aPTT monitoring with manual calculations.

### Quality improvement guidelines for the treatment of lower-extremity deep vein thrombosis with use of endovascular thrombus removal [^61aaad3f]. Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2014). Medium credibility.

Lower-extremity DVT quality measures — diagnosis timing, thresholds, and complication definitions are specified: PTS should not be diagnosed until at least 3 months after the DVT episode; physicians should strive to achieve perfect outcomes (eg, 100% success, 0% complications), but a threshold is a specific level of an indicator which should prompt a review, and when measures fall below a (minimum) threshold or when complication rates exceed a (maximum) threshold, a review should be performed to determine causes and implement changes; major complications result in admission, unplanned increase in level of care, prolonged hospitalization, permanent adverse sequelae, or death, whereas minor complications result in no sequelae and may require nominal therapy or a short hospital stay for observation, and the complication rates and thresholds in this document refer to major complications.

Rivaroxaban — monitoring anticoagulant intensity — The predictable pharmacologic profile of rivaroxaban allows administration at fixed doses without the need for routine laboratory monitoring or dose adjustments, though there may be rare situations (overdose, unexpected bleeding, compliance assessment, drug interactions, or drug accumulation in renal or hepatic impairment) when a quantitative clotting assay might be valuable; however, there are currently no validated laboratory assays that can be recommended to monitor rivaroxaban or any recommendations for dose adjustments based on observed test results. Thromboplastins used for prothrombin time (PT) assays have differing sensitivities to factor Xa inhibitors, the INR does not adequately correct for these differences, and PT ratios measured after adding rivaroxaban 1 µg/mL to plasma varied from 2.25 to 7.32 with different thromboplastins; in assay evaluations, there was a concentration-dependent prolongation of the PT and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), the effect on the aPTT was weaker than on the PT, and rivaroxaban also prolonged thromboelastograph parameters. Neither the PT (expressed either in seconds or as a ratio) nor the aPTT should be used to monitor the anticoagulant effect of rivaroxaban.

### Use of the activated partial thromboplastin time for heparin monitoring [^aa0d1869]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2001). Low credibility.

The objectives of the present study were to evaluate the relationship between heparin concentration and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) results, define a heparin concentration-derived therapeutic range for each aPTT instrument, compare aPTT- and heparin concentration-guided dosage adjustment decisions, and compare laboratory- and bedside aPTT-guided decisions. In phase 1, 102 blood samples were analyzed for bedside and laboratory aPTTs and heparin concentration (used to establish aPTT therapeutic range). In phase 2, 100 samples were analyzed in the same manner. Correlations for aPTT compared with heparin ranged from 0.36 to 0.82. Dosage adjustment decisions guided by the aPTT agreed with those based on heparin concentration 63% to 80% of the time. Laboratory and bedside aPTT dosage adjustment decisions agreed 59% to 68% of the time. The correlation of aPTT with heparin concentration and agreement between aPTT- and heparin-guided decisions vary with the aPTT instrument. Decisions guided by laboratory aPTT results often disagree with decisions guided by bedside aPTT results.

### How I treat recurrent deep-vein thrombosis [^b50a1fc5]. Blood (2016). Low credibility.

Deep-vein thrombosis (DVT) is regarded a chronic disease as it often recurs. DVT affects most frequently the lower limbs and hence DVT of the leg will be the focus of this article. Whereas algorithms were developed and validated for the diagnosis of a first DVT, no such well-defined strategies exist in the case of recurrence of DVT. Likewise, the scientific evidence regarding the treatment of recurrent DVT is sparse, in particular when it comes to deciding on the duration of anticoagulation. Two typical cases of recurrent DVT, one with an unprovoked DVT and one with DVT during anticoagulation, will be presented. Based on these two clinical scenarios, algorithms for the diagnosis and treatment of recurrent DVT will be put forward. The purpose of this article is to discuss strategies that can be applied in daily clinical practice by physicians who do not have access to means and measures available in specialized thrombosis centers.

Intravenous UFH dosing strategies and monitoring — five RCTs compared initial IV UFH dosing according to a weight-based nomogram with a fixed-dose approach; in the remaining three RCTs a total of 292 patients were randomized, study follow-up periods ranged from 48 h to 3 months, and the two weight-based and fixed-dose approaches achieved similar therapeutic aPTTs during the first 24 to 48 h. Event data included "vs two (OR, 0.22; 95% CI, 0.02–1.13) in the fixed-dose vs weight-adjusted group and only one major bleed (fixed-dose group)", and "These results suggest that weight-adjusted dosing and fixed dosing of IV UFH are similar in outcomes", though "Small numbers of clinical events and failure to specify the timing of thromboembolic complications are major limitations of available studies". Either regimen can be monitored with plasma heparin levels, but there is no evidence to suggest that monitoring improves clinical outcomes, and "The evidence linking plasma heparin levels of 0.3 to 0.7 International Units/mL anti-Xa activity by the amidolytic assay to the occurrence of either bleeding or thrombosis is also of low quality".

Dabigatran monitoring — laboratory tests and clinical utility: Simple widely used coagulation tests have limitations for measuring dabigatran effect because PT and aPTT are relatively insensitive, the aPTT–dabigatran relation is nonlinear, and the usual TCT is oversensitive. The ECT has a linear dose-response but is not readily available. There is no evidence relevant to clinical benefits from laboratory testing, and it seems unlikely that routine monitoring would yield any wide clinical benefit. In major bleeding or urgent/emergent surgery, a normal TCT rules out the presence of dabigatran, and TCT tests are routinely available in many laboratories.

### Direct oral anticoagulant monitoring: what laboratory tests are available to guide us? [^c53eb4dc]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2019). Medium credibility.

Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are increasingly used in the treatment and prophylaxis of thromboembolism because of several advantages over vitamin K antagonists, including no need for laboratory monitoring. However, it has become increasingly important in certain clinical scenarios to know either actual DOAC concentration (quantitative) or presence of DOAC (qualitative). These clinical conditions include patients presenting with major bleeding or requiring urgent surgery who may need a reversal or hemostatic agent, extremes of body weight, failed therapy, etc. Prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time are variably affected by factor Xa inhibitors (FXaIs) and direct thrombin inhibitor (DTI), respectively, depending on reagents' sensitivity, and hence, they cannot be relied on confidently. Thrombin time is highly sensitive to very low amounts of DTI; thus, normal value rules out a clinically significant amount. Liquid chromatography mass spectrometry accurately measures DOAC levels but is clinically impractical. Dilute thrombin time and ecarin-based assays using appropriate calibrators/controls provide an accurate DTI level. Anti-Xa assay using corresponding FXaI calibrators/controls provides accurate drug levels. However, these assays are not readily available in the United States compared with some other parts of the world. Heparin assays using anti-Xa activity often have a linear relationship with calibrated FXaI assays, especially at the lower end of on-therapy levels, and they may provide rapid assessment of drug activity for clinical decision making. Currently, there is very limited knowledge of DOAC effect on viscoelastic measurements. Although there is uniformity in expression of DOAC concentrations in nanograms per milliliter, a universal FXaI DOAC assay is urgently needed.

### Subcutaneous unfractionated heparin compared with low-molecular-weight heparin for the initial treatment of venous thromboembolism [^f59e0163]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Low-molecular-weight heparin is the preferred choice for the initial treatment of acute, uncomplicated venous thromboembolism. In this context, unfractionated heparin is as safe and effective as low-molecular-weight heparin but requires strict laboratory monitoring. Twice-daily subcutaneous unfractionated heparin is more effective than, and as safe as, intravenous unfractionated heparin and may simplify patient treatment in or out of the hospital, being possibly cost saving, especially if it is used in weight-based, fixed, unadjusted doses. The present review focuses on the relative values of low-molecular-weight heparin and subcutaneous unfractionated heparin for the initial treatment of venous thromboembolism.

Recent Findings

The major advantages of low-molecular-weight heparin over unfractionated heparin seem to be ease of administration and cost savings associated with home therapy or early hospital discharge; however, many patients with venous thromboembolism are still admitted to the hospital for treatment, and unfractionated heparin is extensively used to this purpose, especially in the United States. Subcutaneous unfractionated heparin, adjusted according to activated partial thromboplastin time algorithms, is as safe and effective as low-molecular-weight heparin for the treatment of venous thromboembolism, allows for quick mobilization and early discharge of suitable patients, and represents a cost-effective strategy. Fixed-dose unfractionated heparin, like low-molecular-weight heparin, may be used for the home treatment of deep vein thrombosis.

Summary

Subcutaneous unfractionated heparin, targeted on activated partial thromboplastin time results or in fixed doses, may be used in or out of the hospital for the treatment of venous thromboembolism, being possibly cost effective; however, these findings need confirmation through appropriate, large-sample, randomized clinical trials.

### Shorter hospital stays and lower costs for rivaroxaban compared with warfarin for venous thrombosis admissions [^cf81560f]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) are manifestations of venous thromboembolic disease processes that result in serious and chronic comorbidities (eg, vascular insufficiencies, pulmonary hypertension) or death. 1 In the United States, venous thromboembolism (VTE) is estimated to occur in about 100 persons per 100 000 annually, with about two thirds of cases being DVT. 1, 2, 3 The economic and healthcare system burden of VTE is substantial, with estimated annual costs ranging from $13.5 to $27.2 billion (2011 US dollars). 4

Standard therapy for VTE is early treatment with parenteral anticoagulation, with the main goals of preventing extension and recurrence of the thrombotic event. 5 Acute DVT is more often treated at home than in the hospital, while acute PE is typically treated in the hospital since it is associated with much higher short‐term mortality. 5 Anticoagulation has traditionally been initiated with subcutaneous or intravenous heparin, either low‐molecular‐weight heparin or unfractionated heparin, given in combination with a vitamin K antagonist (VKA), most commonly warfarin, started concurrently or shortly after initiating the heparin therapy. 5 VKAs have several clinical limitations. Warfarin is slow‐acting, with a narrow therapeutic range, unpredictable anticoagulant effects due to food and drug interactions, and highly variable metabolism. 6 Routine coagulation (laboratory) monitoring and dose adjustment are needed to maintain blood coagulation within the desired therapeutic window.

### Argatroban dose reductions for suspected heparin-induced thrombocytopenia complicated by Child-Pugh class C liver disease [^b1f3cec4]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To report our experience of reduced-dose argatroban in a patient with suspected heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) and Child-Pugh class C liver disease and review the relevant literature to summarize current recommendations on argatroban use in patients with severe liver disease.

Case Summary

A 58-year-old male with Child-Pugh class C liver disease (Model for End-Stage Liver Disease [MELD] score = 31, total bilirubin 4.5 mg/dL) and hemodialysis-dependent renal failure was hospitalized with acute deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Three days after heparin initiation for DVT, he developed thrombocytopenia. Given his heparin exposure (both for treatment of DVT and ongoing hemodialysis), HIT was suspected and all heparinoids were immediately discontinued. Argatroban was initiated for the treatment of HIT while laboratory testing for HIT antibodies and the serotonin release assay were completed. Because of the patient's advanced liver disease, the starting dose of argatroban was reduced to 0.2 μg/kg/min, with frequent monitoring of the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) (goal 60–85 seconds). Despite this dose reduction, the aPTT was supratherapeutic. Following further dose reductions, a final argatroban maintenance dose of 0.05 μg/kg/min was necessary for the attainment of goal aPTTs.

Discussion

Reducing the starting dose of argatroban to 0.5 μg/kg/min is recommended in patients with liver disease. Nevertheless, this recommended dose is largely based on data from patients with more moderate liver disease (eg, Child-Pugh class A or B), and dosing in more advanced liver disease remains largely unexplored. Patients with more advanced liver disease may require additional dose reductions to avoid supratherapeutic concentrations of anticoagulation agents and to minimize bleeding risk.

Conclusions

This report illustrates the importance of careful selection of argatroban dosing and appropriate aPTT monitoring in patients with severe liver disease. Excessive anticoagulation may precipitate major bleeding complications, placing patients with this complicated disease at undue risk.

Unfractionated heparin (UFH) dosing nomogram — pediatric venous thromboembolism (VTE) dosing includes age-based loading and maintenance rates, with infusion titration by activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) or anti-FXa. Loading doses are ≤ 1 y: 75 IU/kg over 10 min (maximum dose 5000 IU) and ≥ 1 y: 50 IU/kg over 10 min (maximum dose 5000 IU). Initial maintenance rates are < 1 y: 28 IU/kg per h; ≤ 15 y: 20 IU/kg per h (or an equivalent IU/kg per h to a maximum rate of 1250 IU/h); and ≥ 16 y: 18 IU/kg per h (or an equivalent IU/kg per h to a maximum rate of 1250 IU/h). Dose adjustment thresholds are: aPTT < 50 s / anti-FXa < 0.1 IU/mL — bolus of 50 IU/kg and increase infusion rate by 20% with repeat level 4 h after rate change; 50–59 s / 0.1–0.29 IU/mL — increase infusion rate by 10% and repeat in 4 h; 60–85 s / 0.35–0.7 IU/mL — no change, recheck in 4 h and when there are 2 consecutive levels in goal range then check next day; 86–95 s / 0.71–0.9 IU/mL — decrease infusion rate by 10% and repeat in 4 h; 96–120 s / 0.91–1 IU/mL — hold infusion for 30 min and decrease infusion rate by 10% and repeat in 4 h; and > 120 s / > 1 IU/mL — hold infusion for 60 min and decrease infusion rate by 20% and repeat in 4 h. Footnotes note the loading dose is not recommended in neonates and in patients at high risk of bleeding.

### Monitoring of unfractionated heparin with the activated partial thromboplastin time: determination of therapeutic ranges [^d628adf6]. Thrombosis Research (2002). Low credibility.

The purpose of the present study was to determine therapeutic ranges for unfractionated heparin therapy using the activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) by calibration against anti-Xa concentration. APTT assays were performed locally, i.e. at the institution of blood collection, on fresh plasma samples from patients treated with intravenous unfractionated heparin. The measurements were performed by 25 Dutch clinical laboratories using 11 different APTT reagents and 10 different types of coagulometers. After the local APTT measurement, the samples were frozen and transported to a central laboratory for measurement of anti-Xa activity. The number of samples from the participating laboratories ranged from 10 to 48. Local APTT results were correlated with the central anti-Xa measurements. Orthogonal regression analysis of log-transformed values was used to calculate APTT therapeutic ranges corresponding to anti-Xa concentrations of 0.29–0.47 IU/ml. The calculated APTT ranges were different between laboratories, even when the same reagent was used. In many laboratories, the therapeutic APTT range in use was much wider than the calculated range. Imprecision of the calculated APTT range was influenced by the wide scatter of the measurement points and by the selection of samples for the orthogonal regression equation. The present results show that, if anti-Xa concentrations of 0.29–0.47 IU/ml reflect the true therapeutic range, many laboratories do not use the proper therapeutic APTT range.

### How I assess and manage the risk of bleeding in patients treated for venous thromboembolism [^3491025f]. Blood (2020). Medium credibility.

For patients with venous thromboembolism (VTE), prediction of bleeding is relevant throughout the course of treatment, although the means and goal of this prediction differ between the subsequent stages of treatment: treatment initiation, hospital discharge, 3-month follow-up, and long-term follow-up. Even in the absence of fully established risk prediction schemes and outcome studies using a prediction scheme for treatment decisions, the present evidence supports screening for and targeting of modifiable risk factors for major bleeding, as well as the application of decision rules to identify patients at low risk of bleeding complications, in whom long-term anticoagulant treatment is likely safe. Moving forward, prediction tools need to be incorporated in well-designed randomized controlled trials aiming to establish optimal treatment duration in patients at high risk of recurrent VTE. Moreover, the benefit of their longitudinal assessment rather than application as stand-alone baseline assessments should be studied, because changes in bleeding risk over time likely constitute the best predictor of major bleeding. We provide the state-of-the-art of assessing and managing bleeding risk in patients with acute VTE and highlight a practical approach for daily practice illustrated by 2 case scenarios.

14.4	Treatment of Deep Vein Thrombosis with or without Pulmonary Embolism

In a multicenter, parallel group study, 900 patients with acute lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT) with or without pulmonary embolism (PE) were randomized to an inpatient (hospital) treatment of either (i) Lovenox 1.5 mg/kg once a day subcutaneously, (ii) Lovenox 1 mg/kg every 12 hours subcutaneously, or (iii) heparin intravenous bolus (5000 IU) followed by a continuous infusion (administered to achieve an aPTT of 55 to 85 seconds). A total of 900 patients were randomized in the study and all patients were treated. Patients ranged in age from 18 to 92 years (mean age 60.7 years) with 54.7% men and 45.3% women. All patients also received warfarin sodium (dose adjusted according to PT to achieve an International Normalization Ratio [INR] of 2.0 to 3.0), commencing within 72 hours of initiation of Lovenox or standard heparin therapy, and continuing for 90 days. Lovenox or standard heparin therapy was administered for a minimum of 5 days and until the targeted warfarin sodium INR was achieved. Both Lovenox regimens were equivalent to standard heparin therapy in reducing the risk of recurrent venous thromboembolism (DVT and/or PE). The efficacy data are provided below (see Table 21).

### Antithrombotic therapy for venous thromboembolic disease: the seventh ACCP conference on antithrombotic and thrombolytic therapy [^11838c76]. Chest (2004). Low credibility.

This chapter about antithrombotic therapy for venous thromboembolic disease is part of the seventh ACCP Conference on Antithrombotic and Thrombolytic Therapy: Evidence Based Guidelines. Grade 1 recommendations are strong and indicate that the benefits do, or do not, outweigh risks, burden, and costs. Grade 2 suggests that individual patients' values may lead to different choices (for a full understanding of the grading see Guyatt et al, CHEST 2004; 126:179S-187S). Among the key recommendations in this chapter are the following: for patients with objectively confirmed deep vein thrombosis (DVT), we recommend short-term treatment with subcutaneous (SC) low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) or, alternatively, IV unfractionated heparin (UFH) [both Grade 1A]. For patients with a high clinical suspicion of DVT, we recommend treatment with anticoagulants while awaiting the outcome of diagnostic tests (Grade 1C+). In acute DVT, we recommend initial treatment with LMWH or UFH for at least 5 days (Grade 1C), initiation of vitamin K antagonist (VKA) together with LMWH or UFH on the first treatment day, and discontinuation of heparin when the international normalized ratio (INR) is stable and > 2.0 (Grade 1A). For the duration and intensity of treatment for acute DVT of the leg, the recommendations include the following: for patients with a first episode of DVT secondary to a transient (reversible) risk factor, we recommend long-term treatment with a VKA for 3 months over treatment for shorter periods (Grade 1A). For patients with a first episode of idiopathic DVT, we recommend treatment with a VKA for at least 6 to 12 months (Grade 1A). We recommend that the dose of VKA be adjusted to maintain a target INR of 2.5 (INR range, 2.0 to 3.0) for all treatment durations (Grade 1A). We recommend against high-intensity VKA therapy (INR range, 3.1 to 4.0) [Grade 1A] and against low-intensity therapy (INR range, 1.5 to 1.9) compared to INR range of 2.0 to 3.0 (Grade 1A). For the prevention of the postthrombotic syndrome, we recommend the use of an elastic compression stocking (Grade 1A). For patients with objectively confirmed nonmassive PE, we recommend acute treatment with SC LMWH or, alternatively, IV UFH (both Grade 1A). For most patients with pulmonary embolism (PE), we recommend clinicians not use systemic thrombolytic therapy (Grade 1A). For the duration and intensity of treatment for PE, the recommendations are similar to those for DVT.

### DVT and pulmonary embolism: part II. treatment and prevention [^1dc9432a]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

Treatment goals for deep venous thrombosis include stopping clot propagation and preventing the recurrence of thrombus, the occurrence of pulmonary embolism, and the development of pulmonary hypertension, which can be a complication of multiple recurrent pulmonary emboli. About 30 percent of patients with deep venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolism have a thrombophilia. An extensive evaluation is suggested in patients younger than 50 years with an idiopathic episode of deep venous thrombosis, patients with recurrent thrombosis, and patients with a family history of thromboembolism. Infusion of unfractionated heparin followed by oral administration of warfarin remains the mainstay of treatment for deep venous thrombosis. Subcutaneously administered low-molecular-weight (LMW) heparin is at least as effective as unfractionated heparin given in a continuous infusion. LMW heparin is the agent of choice for treating deep venous thrombosis in pregnant women and patients with cancer. Based on validated protocols, warfarin can be started at a dosage of 5 or 10 mg per day. The intensity and duration of warfarin therapy depends on the individual patient, but treatment of at least three months usually is required. Some patients with thrombophilias require lifetime anticoagulation. Treatment for pulmonary embolism is similar to that for deep venous thrombosis. Because of the risk of hypoxemia and hemodynamic instability, in-hospital management is advised. Unfractionated heparin commonly is used, although LMW heparin is safe and effective. Thrombolysis is used in patients with massive pulmonary embolism. Subcutaneous heparin, LMW heparin, and warfarin have been approved for use in surgical prophylaxis. Elastic compression stockings are useful in patients at lowest risk for thromboembolism. Intermittent pneumatic leg compression is a useful adjunct to anticoagulation and an alternative when anticoagulation is contraindicated.

### Coagulopathies in orthopaedics: links to inflammation and the potential of individualizing treatment strategies [^9aca337a]. Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma (2013). Low credibility.

Orthopaedic patients are at risk for developing pathologic imbalances of coagulation factors characterized by phases of both hypocoagulability and hypercoagulability. Complications from "hypocoagulability" include life-threatening hemorrhage, wound hematoma, and poor wound healing. Complications due to "hypercoagulability" include deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolus, and disseminated intravascular coagulation. In addition, coagulation imbalance that favors the production of procoagulant factors may lead to excessive inflammation and contribute to systemic inflammatory response syndrome, acute respiratory distress syndrome, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, and death. Optimally, the goal of individualized treatment of coagulopathies in orthopaedic patients should be to achieve efficient healing while avoiding the morbidities associated with imbalance of coagulation and inflammation. Such individualized and time-sensitive measures of coagulation status require rapid, accurate, qualitative, and quantitative assessment of the critical balance of the coagulation system. Commonly used coagulation tests (prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time) are incapable of determining this balance. An alternative to is to perform thrombin generation assays. The greatest advantage of thrombin generation assays over traditional coagulation tests is their ability to detect hypercoagulability, the balance of procoagulant and anticoagulant factors, and the effect of all pharmaceutical anticoagulants. Further clinical investigations are warranted to develop and refine the thrombin generation assays to help predict clinical complications related to coagulation imbalances. In addition, future testing will help define the prothrombotic period allowing for appropriate initiation and cessation of anticoagulant pharmaceuticals. These subsequent studies have the potential to allow the development of a real-time coagulation monitoring strategy that could have paramount implications in the management of postoperative patients.

### Analysis of partial thromboplastin times in patients with pulmonary embolism during the first 48 hours of anticoagulation with unfractionated heparin [^99ab1b29]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

The objective was to determine the proportion of patients with pulmonary embolism (PE) treated with unfractionated heparin (UFH) who achieved therapeutic activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) values within 48 hours of treatment.

Methods

Retrospective analysis of a PE response team (PERT) database was performed at a large, urban, academic teaching hospital. Inclusion criteria were adult patients with acute PE for whom the PERT was consulted and who received anticoagulation (AC) with UFH according to guideline standard dosing. aPTT values during 6-hour time periods during the first 48 hours of AC were collected and analyzed.

Results

A total of 505 patients met inclusion criteria. For patients receiving a bolus and infusion of UFH, the proportions (95% confidence interval [CI]) of patients in the therapeutic range were 19.0% (14.2% to 25.0%) at 12 hours, 26.3% (26.3% to 33.1%) at 24 hours, 28.3% (22.0% to 35.4%) at 36 hours, and 28.4% (20.8% to 37.5%) at 48 hours. For titrated infusion only, the proportions (95% CIs) of patients were 23.3% (16.2% to 32.3%) at 12 hours, 41.4% (31.6% to 51.9%) at 24 hours, 37.0% (26.8% to 48.5%) at 36 hours, and 42.1% (30.2% to 55.0%) at 48 hours. No patient had all therapeutic aPTT values.

Conclusions

The majority of patients with acute PE spend most of their first 48 hours outside of the therapeutic range of AC when treated with guideline standard dosing of UFH. Over half of the patients fail to achieve any therapeutic PTT level within 24 hours of UFH initiation, and no patient had all therapeutic aPTTs. Future research should focus on identifying factors associated with achieving therapeutic AC with UFH.

Monitoring treatment with antithrombotic drugs

There is no doubt that TG is decreased in a dose-dependent fashion in patients treated with any antithrombotic drug (e.g. heparins, parenteral direct thrombin inhibitors, warfarin or direct oral anticoagulants). However, there is still no conclusive evidence that the TG procedure is superior for treatment monitoring to the APTT (unfractionated heparin), anti-factor Xa assays (low molecular weight heparin), the PT-International Normalized Ratio (warfarin) or the specific measurement of the plasma concentration of direct oral anticoagulants.

### Medical management of venous thromboembolic disease [^279f939f]. Techniques in Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2004). Low credibility.

Venous thromboembolic disease (deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism) are common disorders with serious morbid and mortal complications. Given the varied modes of presentation, a high clinical index of suspicion in patients at risk must exist among physicians. Standard therapy has consisted of intravenous unfractionated heparin and overlapping administration of an oral Vitamin K antagonist, commonly Warfarin. Although an effective strategy, many practical limitations exist, including the need for prolonged hospitalization, frequent laboratory monitoring for anticoagulant effect, and erratic dose-response curves. Recently, subcutaneous low-molecular-weight heparins have emerged as safe and effective alternatives for unfractionated heparin. Appropriate patients may be treated with low-molecular-weight heparins and oral Warfarin entirely as outpatients, with similar efficacy and risk of recurrent thromboembolic events and hemorrhage. Thrombolytic therapy is a reasonable alternative in patients with iliofemoral venous thrombosis and/or pulmonary embolism resulting in hemodynamic compromise or obstructing significant pulmonary vasculature. Risks of serious hemorrhagic side effects including intracranial hemorrhage, along with the added economic burden, have limited widespread acceptance of thrombolytic therapy as primary treatment. Emerging oral direct thrombin inhibitors and other novel agents stand to move the treatment of patients with venous thromboemboli to even greater levels of safety and efficacy.

### Pragmatic recommendations for the management of anticoagulation and venous thrombotic disease for hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in low-and middle-income countries [^e8c77ba9]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2021). Medium credibility.

Availability, feasibility, affordability, and safety.

Frequent inpatient monitoring of serum coagulation parameters may be feasible for some LMIC facilities, but limited in many others. In situations where the costs of inpatient laboratory testing are passed to the patient or the family, these costs can quickly become prohibitive, so laboratory testing must be ordered judiciously.

The most common anticoagulant used in many LMIC settings for initial inpatient treatment is UFH. The major feasibility issue with UFH is the need for frequent blood draws to monitor activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) levels.

Limited laboratory capacity in some LMIC settings may preclude safe inpatient administration of continuous UFH infusion, although a fixed-dose weight and renal adjusted UFH protocol may be a safe alternative where LMWH is unavailable. Low molecular weight heparin requires no laboratory monitoring, but is typically more expensive for inpatients and may not be as readily available in some settings. Despite the high drug cost, studies from Europe and Brazil suggest that outpatient treatment of VTE with LMWH may save as much as US$1,641 per patient compared with inpatient UFH therapy. This cost saving analysis likely is irrelevant for the hospitalized COVID-19 patient given the low likelihood of outpatient therapy for this disease.

After the initial heparin-based therapy, the most common outpatient anticoagulant used in LMICs is warfarin. Warfarin is well studied, having been used for many years, and low cost generic versions are readily available throughout the world. The need for and costs associated with necessary laboratory monitoring of INR for warfarin patients, however, may be difficult in most resource-limited settings in LMICs. Even in facilities with relatively ample resources, appropriate treatment based on INR can be challenging.

Recommendations and suggestions (Table 1).

1) In LMICs, we recommend initiating therapeutic anticoagulation for hospitalized COVID-19 patients with high clinical suspicion of VTE, in accordance with local clinical practice guidelines, even in the absence of testing (strong recommendation and low quality of evidence).
2) If available, we recommend LMWH over UFH or DOACs for treatment of VTE in LMICs to minimize risk to healthcare workers (UG best practice statement).
3) In LMIC settings where continuous intravenous UFH or LMWH are unavailable or not feasible, we recommend fixed dose heparin, adjusted to body weight and renal function, in hospitalized COVID-19 patients with high clinical suspicion of VTE (weak recommendation and low quality of evidence)

How should COVID-19 patients on treatment for VTE be routinely monitored in LMICs?

Fondaparinux

Therapeutic range

Fondaparinux is not routinely monitored in adults but, if required, can be monitored using an anti-FXa activity assay, calibrated with fondaparinux. Target peak concentration for therapeutic anticoagulation in adults is 0.5 to 1.0 mg/L, and this range has been extrapolated to children treated with fondaparinux. Fondaparinux does not usually affect routine coagulation tests, prothrombin time, or aPTT, when used in therapeutic doses but can cause aPTT prolongation at higher doses.

Dosing/dose frequency

A starting dose of 0.1 mg/kg once daily is recommended in children aged 1 to 17 years. This is based on an open-label prospective study (FondaKIDS) of 24 children treated for DVT or HIT. Dosing was adjusted to achieve peak concentrations of 0.5 to 1.0 mg/L after 4 hours, tested initially after the first dose, with 88% of individuals achieving the target concentration without dose adjustment.

Periprocedural management

The anticoagulant effect of fondaparinux may persist for 2 to 4 days in patients with normal renal function because of its long elimination half-life.

Management of bleeding

There is no antidote to fondaparinux. Bleeding should be managed as per protocols for managing bleeding due to other irreversible anticoagulants.

Warfarin, acenocoumarol, and phenprocoumon

Therapeutic range

Target therapeutic ranges for children are currently extrapolated from the therapeutic ranges used in adults for the different indications. The most common target international normalized ratio (INR) for children for the treatment of VTE is 2.5 (range, 2.0–3.0). High-risk conditions may require a higher range of 2.5 to 3.5. As yet, there have been no clinical trials to assess appropriate INR ranges for children.

### Study details | NCT02744092 | Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) versus LMWH ± warfarin for VTE in cancer… [^5ee00df8]. ClinicalTrials (2016). Low credibility.

Study Overview Venous blood clots affect nearly a million Americans each year. Venous clots in the legs are called deep venous thrombosis and are dangerous because they travel to the lungs where they cause blockages known as pulmonary emboli. DVT and PE are called venous thromboemboli. Cancer is a risk factor with nearly 200, 000 VTEs in cancer patients each year. The purpose of VTE treatment is to prevent the initial clot from spreading and to prevent new clots from forming. This is accomplished by thinning the blood, or anticoagulation. Without anticoagulation, VTEs recur and are often fatal. Recently, the FDA has approved 4 new Direct Oral AntiCoagulants for preventing VTE recurrence. Few cancer patients were included in the efficacy trials, and practice guidelines fall silent on whether switching to DOAC therapy is advisable.

To fill this knowledge gap, the Alliance Foundation Trials LLC, a research network of academic and community practices across the US, is conducting a pragmatic randomized effectiveness trial. The overarching objective of the study is to determine the effectiveness of LMWH/ warfarin vs. DOAC anticoagulation for preventing recurrent VTE in cancer patients. The investigators will conduct a trial of 811 cancer patients followed for 6 months. The intervention strategy is DOAC therapy with edoxaban, apixaban, rivaroxaban, or dabigatran. The investigators hypothesize that the benefits, harms and burdens of DOAC treatment will be non-inferior to, or better than, usual care with LMWH/ warfarin among cancer patients. The information gained will empower cancer patients and physicians to make more informed choices about anticoagulation strategies to manage VTE.

Diagnosis of VTE ≤ 30 days prior to study enrollment for which potential benefits of anticoagulation therapy to prevent recurrence of VTE are felt by the treating physician to exceed the potential harms.
- Any anticoagulation drug/strategy may be used to treat the index VTE; protocol treatment will begin ≤ 30days after the index VTE diagnosis date
- Treating physician intends to put participant on anticoagulation therapy for at least three months.
- Age ≥ 18 years
- Platelet count is ≥ 50, 000/mm³.

### Tinzaparin sodium (Innohep) [^f6237d3b]. FDA (2008). Low credibility.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

Tinzaparin sodium is a low molecular weight heparin with antithrombotic properties. Tinzaparin sodium inhibits reactions that lead to the clotting of blood including the formation of fibrin clots, both in vitro and in vivo. It acts as a potent co-inhibitor of several activated coagulation factors, especially Factors Xa and IIa (thrombin). The primary inhibitory activity is mediated through the plasma protease inhibitor, antithrombin.

Bleeding time is usually unaffected by tinzaparin sodium. Activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) is prolonged by therapeutic doses of tinzaparin sodium used in the treatment of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Prothrombin time (PT) may be slightly prolonged with tinzaparin sodium treatment but usually remains within the normal range. Neither aPTT nor PT can be used for therapeutic monitoring of tinzaparin sodium.

Neither unfractionated heparin nor tinzaparin sodium have intrinsic fibrinolytic activity; therefore, they do not lyse existing clots. Tinzaparin sodium induces release of tissue factor pathway inhibitor, which may contribute to the antithrombotic effect. Heparin is also known to have a variety of actions that are independent of its anticoagulant effects. These include interactions with endothelial cell growth factors, inhibition of smooth muscle cell proliferation, activation of lipoprotein lipase, suppression of aldosterone secretion, and induction of platelet aggregation.

Pharmacokinetics/Pharmacodynamics

Anti-Xa and anti-IIa activities are the primary biomarkers for assessing tinzaparin sodium exposure because plasma concentrations of low molecular weight heparins cannot be measured directly. Because of analytical assay limitations, anti-Xa activity is the more widely used biomarker. The measurements of anti-Xa and anti-IIa activities in plasma serve as surrogates for the concentrations of molecules which contain the high-affinity binding site for antithrombin (anti-Xa and anti-IIa activities). Monitoring patients based on anti-Xa activity is generally not advised. The data are provided in Figure 1 and Table 2. below.

Studies with tinzaparin sodium in healthy volunteers and patients have been conducted with both fixed- and weight-adjusted dose administration. Recommended therapy with tinzaparin sodium is based on weight-adjusted dosing (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).

### Study details | Acute venous thrombosis: thrombus… [^3d4d4aaf]. ClinicalTrials (2008). Low credibility.

Study Overview Activase, the study drug, is a fibrinolytic drug that is indicated for use in acute myocardial infarction, acute ischemic stroke, and acute massive pulmonary embolism in adults. Previous studies have established the ability of rt-PA to lyse venous thrombus in patients with deep vein thrombosis, and suggest that successful rt-PA mediated thrombolysis can prevent the post-thrombotic syndrome, a morbid, late complication of DVT that occurs in nearly 50% of patients. rt-PA is delivered directly into venous thrombus using a catheter/device which is embedded within the thrombus by a physician under imaging guidance. This method of rt-PA delivery, pharmacomechanical catheter-directed intrathrombus thrombolysis, is thought to be safer, more effective, and more efficient than previous methods. The question of whether PCDT using rt-PA improves long-term DVT patient outcomes with acceptable risk and cost has not yet been addressed.

The rationale for performing the ATTRACT Trial is based upon:

- the major burden of PTS on DVT patients and the U. S. healthcare system
- the association between rapid clot lysis and prevention of PTS
- the proven ability of rt-PA to dissolve venous thrombus in proximal DVT
- recent advances in CDT methods which may lower bleeding risk
- the major clinical controversy on whether CDT should be routinely used for first-line DVT therapy.
- Age less than 16 years or greater than 75 years.
- Symptom duration > 14 days for the DVT episode in the index leg.
- **In the index leg**: established PTS, or previous symptomatic DVT within the last 2 years.
- **In the contralateral leg**: symptomatic acute DVT a) involving the iliac and/or common femoral vein; or b) for which thrombolysis is planned as part of the initial therapy.
- Limb-threatening circulatory compromise.
- Pulmonary embolism with hemodynamic compromise.
- Inability to tolerate PCDT procedure due to severe dyspnea or acute systemic illness.
- Allergy, hypersensitivity, or thrombocytopenia from heparin, rt-PA, or iodinated contrast, except for mild-moderate contrast allergies for which steroid pre-medication can be used.

### Should we abandon the APTT for monitoring unfractionated heparin? [^48d58408]. Thrombosis Research (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

The activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) is commonly used to monitor unfractionated heparin (UFH) but may not accurately measure the amount of heparin present. The anti-Xa assay is less susceptible to confounding factors and may be a better assay for this purpose.

Materials and Methods

The validity of the APTT for monitoring UFH was assessed by comparing with an anti-Xa assay on 3543 samples from 475 patients (infants [n = 165], children 1-15years [n = 60] and adults [n = 250]) receiving treatment dose UFH.

Results

Overall concordance was poor. The highest concordance (66%; 168/254) was seen in children. Concordance (51.8%) or discordance (48.4%) was almost equal in adult patients. Among adult patients whose anti-Xa level was within 0.3–0.7IU/mL, only 38% had an APTT in the therapeutic range whilst 56% were below and 6% were above therapeutic range. Children and adult patients with anti-Xa of 0.3–0.7IU/mL but sub- therapeutic APTT had significantly higher fibrinogen levels compared to those with therapeutic or supra-therapeutic APTT.

Conclusions

When the anti-Xa level was 0.3–0.7IU/mL, the majority of samples from infants demonstrated a supra-therapeutic APTT, whilst adults tended to have a sub-therapeutic APTT. This may lead to under anticoagulation in infants or over anticoagulation in adults with risk of bleeding if APTT is used to monitor UFH. These results further strengthen existing evidence of the limitation of APTT in monitoring UFH. Discordance of APTT and anti-Xa level in adults and children may be due to elevation of fibrinogen level.

2.4 Deep Vein Thrombosis and Pulmonary Embolism Treatment in Adults

In adult patients with acute symptomatic DVT and in patients with acute symptomatic PE, the recommended dose of ARIXTRA is 5 mg (body weight less than 50 kg), 7.5 mg (body weight 50 kg to 100 kg), or 10 mg (body weight greater than 100 kg) by subcutaneous injection once daily (ARIXTRA treatment regimen). Initiate concomitant treatment with warfarin sodium as soon as possible, usually within 72 hours. Continue treatment with ARIXTRA for at least 5 days and until a therapeutic oral anticoagulant effect is established (INR 2 to 3). The usual duration of administration of ARIXTRA is 5 days to 9 days; up to 26 days of ARIXTRA injection was administered in clinical trials [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6), Adverse Reactions (6), and Clinical Studies (14)].

2.5 Venous Thromboembolism Treatment in Pediatric Patients Aged 1 Year or Older Weighing at Least 10 kg

For patients weighing 10 kg to 20 kg, the recommended initial dose is 0.1 mg/kg subcutaneously once daily. There is no available prefilled syringe for patients in this weight range, and a patient specific dose should be prepared (see section 2.8 Instructions for Preparation of Individual Pediatric Doses in Pharmacies). The dose should be exact and rounded to the nearest 0.1 mg (see Table 1).

For patients weighing over 20 kg, the recommended initial dose is 0.1 mg/kg subcutaneously once daily with doses rounded to the nearest prefilled syringe according to Table 2.

There is no available information for dosing pediatric patients who weigh less than 10 kg.

Monitor fondaparinux levels 2 hours to 4 hours after the second or third dose and then weekly for a month followed by every 1 month to 3 months for the duration of treatment using a fondaparinux-based anti-Xa assay with a therapeutic goal range of 0.5 mg/L to 1 mg/L.

Dosing adjustments may be necessary to achieve peak blood concentration within the therapeutic target of 0.5 mg/L to 1 mg/L (see Table 3). Do not exceed the maximum dose of 7.5 mg/day.

There is no adequate data to support the use of ARIXTRA in pediatric patients below 1 year of age.

Fondaparinux — dosing, monitoring, and renal adjustment: For thromboprophylaxis and acute coronary syndromes the fixed dose is 2.5 mg daily, and for treatment of DVT or pulmonary embolism dosing is 7.5 mg for body weight 50 to 100 kg, decreased to 5 mg if < 50 kg and increased to 10 mg if > 100 kg. Fondaparinux is contraindicated in patients with renal insufficiency (CrCl < 30 mL/min); in moderate renal insufficiency (CrCl 30–50 mL/min) who require thromboprophylaxis, the dose of fondaparinux should be reduced by 50% or low-dose heparin should be used in place of fondaparinux. Routine coagulation monitoring is not recommended; when assessment is needed, anticoagulant activity can be measured using fondaparinux-specific anti-Xa assays and the therapeutic anti-Xa range has not been established. At 2.5 mg daily, peak steady-state plasma concentration averages 0.39 to 0.50 mg/L at approximately 3 h post dose, and with therapeutic dosing (eg, 7.5 mg daily) mean peak steady-state levels are 1.20 to 1.26 mg/L 3 h post dose. Fondaparinux does not bind to protamine sulfate, and if uncontrollable bleeding occurs recombinant factor VIIa may be effective.

### Comparison of six-month outcome of patients initially treated for acute deep vein thrombosis with a low molecular weight heparin certoparin at a fixed, body-weight-independent dosage or unfractionated heparin [^89c0f956]. Haematologica (2003). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Body weight-adjusted subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) has been proven to be more effective and safer than aPTT-adjusted intravenous unfractionated heparin (UFH) for the initial treatment of patients with acute symptomatic deep venous thrombosis (DVT) based on analyses pooling the results of studies with different LMWHs. We investigated whether these findings hold for a particular LMWH by pooling the results of two independent studies.

Design and Methods

Patients with acute symptomatic proximal DVT (n = 1758), proven by ascending phlebography or compression ultrasound, received either a fixed, body weight independent dose of 8,000 IU Certoparin b.i.d. (n = 893) for 8.6 days or intravenous UFH (n = 865) adjusted to an 1.5 to 3.0-fold prolongation of the aPTT for 12.0 days both followed by vitamin K-antagonists for 6 months.

Results

Venous thromboembolism (VTE) re-occurred in 5.1% and 3.1% (RRR 0.62, CI 0.39–0.98, 2p = 0.04), major bleeding in 3.5% and 1.9% (RRR 0.55, CI 0.31–0.99, 2p = 0.05), mortality in 3.6% and 2.1% (RRR 0.59, CI 0.34–1.04, 2p = 0.08), and the composite outcome of all three events in 10.3% and 6.3% (RRR 0.61, CI 0.44 to 0.84, 2p = 0.002) of patients at 6 months initially randomised to UFH and LMWH, respectively.

Interpretation and Conclusions

The initial treatment of acute DVT with a fixed dose of the LMWH, certoparin, is more effective in reducing, over 6 months, the re-occurrence of VTE and the composite outcome of recurrent VTE, major bleeding, and mortality without any relation of the bodyweight of the patients to recurrent venous thromboembolism or major bleeding complications.

### Coagulation status and the presence of postoperative deep vein thrombosis in patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy [^994da87a]. Surgical Endoscopy (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Venous thromboembolism is a relevant social and health care problem because of its high incidence among patients who undergo surgery (20–30% after general surgical operations and 50–75% after orthopedic procedures), its pulmonary embolism-related mortality rate, and its long-term sequelae (postthrombotic syndrome and ulceration), which may be disabling. This study aimed to determine the coagulation status and the presence of postoperative deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in patients undergoing laparoscopic (LC) and open cholecystectomy (OC).

Methods

Prospectively, 114 patients were randomized into two groups. group 1 (58 patients undergoing LC) and group 2 (56 patients who are undergoing OC). The coagulation parameters (prothrombin time [PT], partial thromboplastin time [PTT], D-dimer, prothrombin F1 + 2, antithrombin III, and factor VII) were monitored preoperatively and during the operation, then 24 and 72 h after the operation. The patients in both groups underwent color duplex scan examination preoperatively, then 3 and 7 days after surgery to establish the presence of DVT. None of the patients in either group received thrombosis prophylaxis.

Results

In the LC group, postoperative DVT developed in four patients (6.9%; in the calf veins of 3 patients and in the popliteal vein of 1 patient). In the OC group, nine patients (16.07%) had postoperative DVT (in the calf veins of 7 patients and in the popliteal and femoral veins of 2 patients). The plasma levels of monitored parameters in the patients of both groups were altered, but the difference between the groups was not statistically significant. For the patients in both groups who experienced DVT, only the decrease of factor VII had statistical significance (p < 0.05).

Conclusions

The incidence of postoperative DVT among the patients who underwent OC was higher than among the patients who underwent LC (p < 0.05). The decrease in factor VII among the patients who underwent surgery could be a potentially useful parameter indicating the patients at high risk for developing DVT.

### The pharmacoeconomics of deep vein thrombosis treatment [^139cb9bb]. The American Journal of Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Venous thromboembolism (VTE), encompassing both deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism, remains a common and costly condition that is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Treatment options for initial management of DVT include unfractionated heparin (UFH), low-molecular-weight heparins (LMWHs), and fondaparinux, which is the first of a new class of pentasaccharide antithrombotic agents with anti-factor Xa activity. LMWHs are an important tool in DVT management, offering advantages over UFH such as ease of dosing, lack of need for coagulation monitoring, and reduced risk for heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). Fondaparinux is also characterized by a simple dosing regimen, no need for coagulation monitoring, and potentially a lower risk of HIT compared with LMWH. In a recent clinical trial of DVT management, efficacy and bleeding rates with fondaparinux appeared similar to those observed with LMWH. In contrast to LMWH, fondaparinux is generally given as a fixed dose across a range of patient weights rather than calculated per individual patient weight. Given the increasing economic burden of VTE, particularly due to its increased rate among the elderly, pharmacoeconomic analyses have become a particularly useful tool to aid in selecting among similarly effective and safe agents for VTE treatment. A recent cost-effective analysis demonstrated that fondaparinux use offers an attractive economic alternative to other agents for initial DVT therapy that could yield cost savings without compromising clinical outcomes or patient safety.

### Oral direct thrombin inhibitors or oral factor Xa inhibitors versus conventional anticoagulants for the treatment of deep vein thrombosis [^4cc38e82]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is a condition in which a clot forms in the deep veins, most commonly of the leg. It occurs in approximately one in 1000 people. If left untreated, the clot can travel up to the lungs and cause a potentially life-threatening pulmonary embolism (PE). Previously, a DVT was treated with the anticoagulants heparin and vitamin K antagonists. However, two forms of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) have been developed: oral direct thrombin inhibitors (DTIs) and oral factor Xa inhibitors, which have characteristics that may be favourable compared to conventional treatment, including oral administration, a predictable effect, lack of frequent monitoring or dose adjustment and few known drug interactions. DOACs are now commonly being used for treating DVT: recent guidelines recommended DOACs over conventional anticoagulants for both DVT and PE treatment. This Cochrane Review was first published in 2015. It was the first systematic review to measure the effectiveness and safety of these drugs in the treatment of DVT. This is an update of the 2015 review. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness and safety of oral DTIs and oral factor Xa inhibitors versus conventional anticoagulants for the long-term treatment of DVT.

Search Methods

The Cochrane Vascular Information Specialist searched the Cochrane Vascular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and CINAHL databases and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov trials registers to 1 March 2022.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in which people with a DVT, confirmed by standard imaging techniques, were allocated to receive an oral DTI or an oral factor Xa inhibitor compared with conventional anticoagulation or compared with each other for the treatment of DVT. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were recurrent venous thromboembolism (VTE), recurrent DVT and PE. Secondary outcomes included all-cause mortality, major bleeding, post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS) and quality of life (QoL). We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence for each outcome.

Main Results

We identified 10 new studies with 2950 participants for this update. In total, we included 21 RCTs involving 30,895 participants. Three studies investigated oral DTIs (two dabigatran and one ximelagatran), 17 investigated oral factor Xa inhibitors (eight rivaroxaban, five apixaban and four edoxaban) and one three-arm trial investigated both a DTI (dabigatran) and factor Xa inhibitor (rivaroxaban). Overall, the studies were of good methodological quality. Meta-analysis comparing DTIs to conventional anticoagulation showed no clear difference in the rate of recurrent VTE (odds ratio (OR) 1.17, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.83 to 1.65; 3 studies, 5994 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), recurrent DVT (OR 1.11, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.66; 3 studies, 5994 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), fatal PE (OR 1.32, 95% CI 0.29 to 6.02; 3 studies, 5994 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), non-fatal PE (OR 1.29, 95% CI 0.64 to 2.59; 3 studies, 5994 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) or all-cause mortality (OR 0.66, 95% CI 0.41 to 1.08; 1 study, 2489 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). DTIs reduced the rate of major bleeding (OR 0.58, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.89; 3 studies, 5994 participants; high-certainty evidence). For oral factor Xa inhibitors compared with conventional anticoagulation, meta-analysis demonstrated no clear difference in recurrent VTE (OR 0.85, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.01; 13 studies, 17,505 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), recurrent DVT (OR 0.70, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.01; 9 studies, 16,439 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), fatal PE (OR 1.18, 95% CI 0.69 to 2.02; 6 studies, 15,082 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), non-fatal PE (OR 0.93, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.27; 7 studies, 15,166 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) or all-cause mortality (OR 0.87, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.14; 9 studies, 10,770 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Meta-analysis showed a reduced rate of major bleeding with oral factor Xa inhibitors compared with conventional anticoagulation (OR 0.63, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.89; 17 studies, 18,066 participants; high-certainty evidence). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The current review suggests that DOACs may be superior to conventional therapy in terms of safety (major bleeding), and are probably equivalent in terms of efficacy. There is probably little or no difference between DOACs and conventional anticoagulation in the prevention of recurrent VTE, recurrent DVT, pulmonary embolism and all-cause mortality. DOACs reduced the rate of major bleeding compared to conventional anticoagulation. The certainty of evidence was moderate or high.

### Anticoagulation monitoring part 2: unfractionated heparin and low-molecular-weight heparin [^eba2220f]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the availability, mechanisms, limitations, and clinical application of point-of-care (POC) devices used in monitoring anticoagulation with unfractionated heparin (UFH) and low-molecular-weight heparins (LMWHs).

Data Sources

Articles were identified through a MEDLINE search (1966-August 2004), device manufacturer Web sites, additional references listed in articles and Web sites, and abstracts from scientific meetings.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

English-language literature from clinical trials was reviewed to evaluate the accuracy, reliability, and clinical application of POC monitoring devices.

Data Synthesis

The activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) and activated clotting time (ACT) are common tests for monitoring anticoagulation with UFH. Multiple devices are available for POC aPTT, ACT, and heparin concentration testing. The aPTT therapeutic range for UFH will vary depending upon the reagent and instrument employed. Although recommended by the American College of Chest Physicians Seventh Conference on Antithrombotic and Thrombolytic Therapy, establishing a heparin concentration-derived therapeutic range for UFH is rarely performed. Additional research evaluating anti-factor Xa monitoring of LMWHs using POC testing is necessary.

Conclusions

Multiple POC devices are available to monitor anticoagulation with UFH. For each test, there is some variability in results between devices and between reagents used in the same device. Despite these limitations, POC anticoagulation monitoring of UFH using aPTT and, more often, ACT is common in clinical practice, particularly when evaluating anticoagulation associated with interventional cardiology procedures and cardiopulmonary bypass surgery.

### Quality improvement guidelines for the treatment of lower-extremity deep vein thrombosis with use of endovascular thrombus removal [^ea880080]. Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2014). Medium credibility.

Quality review and follow-up practices are outlined: when the observed rate of early treatment success prompts an internal quality review, we suggest attention to the following items, including ensuring intrathrombus drug delivery was accomplished because systemic thrombolysis and flow-directed thrombolysis are not as effective as intrathrombus CDT and confirming therapeutic-level anticoagulation was provided during procedural manipulations and after procedure completion with heparin-based therapy given during the infusion CDT component; when the observed rate of recurrent thrombosis prompts review, it should be confirmed that patients received careful monitoring of anticoagulation during the initial weeks and that long-term anticoagulant therapy matched individualized recurrence risk; in general, patients with provoked DVT due to a major reversible risk factor should receive at least 3 months of anticoagulant therapy.

### American Society of Hematology 2018 guidelines for management of venous thromboembolism: optimal management of anticoagulation therapy [^7adf178e]. Blood Advances (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Clinicians confront numerous practical issues in optimizing the use of anticoagulants to treat venous thromboembolism (VTE).

Objective

These evidence-based guidelines of the American Society of Hematology (ASH) are intended to support patients, clinicians and other health care professionals in their decisions about the use of anticoagulants in the management of VTE. These guidelines assume the choice of anticoagulant has already been made.

Methods

ASH formed a multidisciplinary guideline panel balanced to minimize potential bias from conflicts of interest. The McMaster University GRADE Centre supported the guideline development process, including updating or performing systematic evidence reviews. The panel prioritized clinical questions and outcomes according to their importance for clinicians and patients. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach was used to assess evidence and make recommendations, which were subject to public comment.

Results

The panel agreed on 25 recommendations and 2 good practice statements to optimize management of patients receiving anticoagulants.

Conclusions

Strong recommendations included using patient self-management of international normalized ratio (INR) with home point-of-care INR monitoring for vitamin K antagonist therapy and against using periprocedural low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) bridging therapy. Conditional recommendations included basing treatment dosing of LMWH on actual body weight, not using anti-factor Xa monitoring to guide LMWH dosing, using specialized anticoagulation management services, and resuming anticoagulation after episodes of life-threatening bleeding.
