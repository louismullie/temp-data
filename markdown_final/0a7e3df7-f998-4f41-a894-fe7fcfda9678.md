## Question

labs that are in iron studies

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which labs are included in an "iron studies" panel. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core components that most laboratories bundle as an iron panel. Then, I should verify which single test is most informative and how inflammation alters interpretation. Next, I will examine the role of transferrin or TIBC and calculated transferrin saturation, including thresholds for deficiency and overload. After that, I should review advanced or adjunctive markers such as soluble transferrin receptor, reticulocyte hemoglobin, percentage hypochromic red cells, and zinc protoporphyrin. Finally, I will integrate guideline-based nuances for special populations like CKD, heart failure, and suspected hereditary hemochromatosis, and summarize practical takeaways for routine ordering and interpretation.

> Let me first confirm the standard composition of "iron studies". In routine practice, the panel usually comprises serum ferritin, serum iron, transferrin or total iron-binding capacity, and a calculated transferrin saturation from serum iron and TIBC or transferrin, with the exact bundle varying by institution, which aligns with gastroenterology, nephrology, and hepatology guidance emphasizing ferritin with transferrin saturation as central to assessment and triage of iron deficiency versus overload states [^116ANoLV] [^114Mor4a] [^1118Xv1A].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about any single marker without context. I need to ensure we anchor on ferritin as the primary indicator of iron stores while acknowledging its acute phase behavior. Multiple high-quality guidelines and systematic reviews concur that ferritin is the single most useful marker to confirm iron deficiency, yet it rises with inflammation so parallel clinical context or adjunct tests like CRP may be needed to avoid false-normal interpretations, and thresholds such as ferritin less than 15 μg/L are highly specific while higher pragmatic cutoffs can be considered in selected settings [^114N2wZa] [^1157g8j4] [^113DECq2] [^112sp2gt].

> Wait, let me verify the transport and availability side. Serum iron alone is variable and influenced by diurnal patterns and inflammation, so it should be interpreted with transferrin or TIBC and especially with calculated transferrin saturation, where low values generally reflect limited iron available for erythropoiesis and high values point toward iron overload syndromes; hepatology guidance specifically prioritizes transferrin saturation together with ferritin as the first step in evaluating suspected hereditary hemochromatosis, and nephrology guidance uses transferrin saturation with ferritin to guide iron therapy decisions rather than serum iron in isolation [^114Mor4a] [^1118Xv1A] [^116ANoLV] [^115WFgXM].

> I should confirm practical thresholds used across clinical contexts. Low transferrin saturation less than about 20 percent is commonly used to indicate iron-restricted availability in trials and practice, while elevated transferrin saturation greater than roughly 45 percent raises concern for hemochromatosis and warrants further evaluation, with hepatology societies recommending transferrin saturation and ferritin as the initial step before proceeding to genetics or imaging as indicated, and perioperative studies and guideline frameworks often categorize iron deficiency using ferritin strata alongside transferrin saturation cut points to reflect absolute versus functional deficiency [^114Mor4a] [^1118Xv1A] [^114SScp5].

> Next, I should review advanced markers that help when inflammation or comorbid states cloud standard indices. Soluble transferrin receptor reflects tissue iron demand and rises with iron deficiency but also with increased erythropoietic drive, and the sTfR to log ferritin index can better discriminate deficiency in chronic disease; reticulocyte hemoglobin and percentage of hypochromic red cells provide early evidence of iron-restricted erythropoiesis and are recommended in CKD algorithms when available, with meta-analytic data suggesting reticulocyte hemoglobin thresholds may effectively screen for iron deficiency and iron-deficiency anemia across comorbid contexts [^113DECq2] [^112sp2gt] [^112rkjre].

> I need to check supportive and contextual tests that refine interpretation. Measuring CRP can help adjudicate whether a normal or elevated ferritin might be confounded by inflammation, and several guidelines endorse incorporating CRP during iron status assessment in CKD or systemic inflammatory states; meanwhile, zinc protoporphyrin may rise when iron is unavailable for heme synthesis, though it is generally considered a supplementary rather than primary test in adult diagnostic pathways [^112sp2gt] [^113DECq2].

> Let me consider red cell indices carefully and avoid over-relying on them. Microcytosis and hypochromia on CBC support iron deficiency but have limited specificity because they also appear in thalassemia, sideroblastic processes, and anemia of chronic disease; among indices, MCH may be somewhat more reliable than MCV for iron deficiency, but both lose sensitivity in chronic disease, so they should complement rather than replace ferritin and transferrin saturation in the diagnostic workup [^116Ln8KB].

> Hold on, I should verify the overarching evidence base positioning ferritin among biomarkers. A Cochrane review and contemporary commentaries reaffirm that very low ferritin levels are highly specific for absent marrow iron, yet ferritin can be normal or elevated in iron deficiency with inflammation, which underscores why iron studies panels are interpreted together and often in tandem with inflammatory markers or therapeutic trials when equivocal [^1157g8j4] [^115WFgXM].

> I will now examine population-specific guidance so we align testing with clinical context. In chronic kidney disease, nephrology guidelines recommend guiding iron therapy using transferrin saturation together with ferritin, integrated with hemoglobin trajectories, blood loss, ESA use, and overall clinical status; in suspected hereditary hemochromatosis, hepatology guidance directs clinicians to start with transferrin saturation and ferritin before proceeding to HFE genotyping and second-line assessments; in heart failure, cardiology guidelines advise periodic screening for anemia and iron deficiency using CBC, ferritin, and transferrin saturation to identify candidates for iron repletion [^116ANoLV] [^114Mor4a] [^116Lx6Vz].

> Let me first confirm the practical bottom line. In most laboratories, an "iron studies" order will yield ferritin, serum iron, and either transferrin or TIBC with a calculated transferrin saturation, and clinicians should add CRP when inflammation is suspected and consider reticulocyte hemoglobin, percent hypochromic red cells, or soluble transferrin receptor in settings like CKD or chronic inflammatory disease where standard markers are equivocal; across guidelines, ferritin remains the anchor test, with transferrin saturation providing critical context for iron availability and for distinguishing deficiency from overload states [^114N2wZa] [^112sp2gt] [^116ANoLV] [^114Mor4a] [^1118Xv1A].

The core iron studies panel includes **serum iron, ferritin, transferrin or TIBC, and transferrin saturation (TSAT)** [^114CUyEC], with ferritin the most specific marker of iron stores [^1157g8j4] and TSAT the key indicator of iron availability [^114Mor4a]. A **CBC with red cell indices (MCV, MCH)** is essential to assess anemia type and severity [^112sp2gt]; reticulocyte hemoglobin (Ret-He) or the percentage of hypochromic red cells can detect early iron-restricted erythropoiesis [^112rkjre] [^113DECq2]. Soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR) helps distinguish iron deficiency from anemia of chronic disease [^113DECq2], and CRP or ESR should be checked to interpret ferritin in inflammatory states [^114N2wZa] [^112sp2gt]. Hepcidin is an emerging test for complex cases [^115Rvodh], and genetic testing (e.g. HFE) is indicated when hereditary hemochromatosis is suspected [^114Mor4a] [^112SQPtX].

## Core iron studies panel

The **core iron studies panel** includes the following tests:

| **Test** | **Description** | **Clinical significance** |
|-|-|-|
| Serum iron | Measures circulating iron bound to transferrin | Low in iron deficiency; high in iron overload |
| Ferritin | Reflects body iron stores | Low in iron deficiency; high in iron overload or inflammation |
| Transferrin or TIBC | Measures iron-binding capacity | High in iron deficiency; low in iron overload |
| Transferrin saturation (TSAT) | Percentage of transferrin saturated with iron | Low in iron deficiency; high in iron overload |

---

Ferritin is the **most specific marker of iron stores**, and **TSAT** is the key indicator of iron availability.

---

## Complete blood count (CBC) and red cell indices

The **CBC and red cell indices** are essential to the evaluation, providing information on anemia type and severity [^116Ln8KB]:

- **Hemoglobin (Hb)**: Low in iron deficiency anemia (IDA) [^111sFJG3].
- **Mean corpuscular volume (MCV)**: Low in IDA (microcytic anemia) [^116Ln8KB].
- **Mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH)**: Low in IDA (hypochromic anemia).
- **Red cell distribution width (RDW)**: Elevated in IDA due to anisocytosis [^114CUyEC].

---

## Additional laboratory tests

Additional tests may be included to provide a more **comprehensive assessment**:

| **Test** | **Description** | **Clinical significance** |
|-|-|-|
| Soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR) | Reflects cellular iron demand | Elevated in iron deficiency; normal in anemia of chronic disease [^113DECq2] |
| Reticulocyte hemoglobin (Ret-He) | Measures hemoglobin content in reticulocytes | Low in early iron deficiency [^112rkjre] |
| Percentage hypochromic red cells | Indicates iron-restricted erythropoiesis | Elevated in iron deficiency [^112sp2gt] |
| C-reactive protein (CRP) or erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) | Markers of inflammation | Elevated in inflammatory states, affecting ferritin interpretation [^112sp2gt] |
| Hepcidin | Hormone regulating iron homeostasis | Low in iron deficiency; high in inflammation or iron overload [^115Rvodh] |

---

## Interpretation of iron studies

Interpretation of iron studies **requires consideration of the clinical context**, including inflammation and chronic disease:

- **Iron deficiency anemia (IDA)**: Low ferritin, low TSAT, high TIBC, low serum iron, elevated sTfR, low Ret-He.
- **Anemia of chronic disease (ACD)**: Normal or elevated ferritin, low TSAT, low serum iron, normal sTfR, normal Ret-He.
- **Iron overload (e.g. hemochromatosis)**: High ferritin, high TSAT, low TIBC, high serum iron [^114Mor4a].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Clinical guidelines emphasize the **importance of iron studies** for diagnosing and managing iron deficiency and overload:

- **Ferritin** [^114CUyEC] is the most useful initial test for diagnosing iron deficiency [^114N2wZa].
- **TSAT and serum iron** [^114Mor4a] provide additional information, especially in suspected false-normal ferritin [^1118Xv1A].
- **Genetic testing** (e.g. HFE gene) [^115gFMow] is recommended in suspected hereditary hemochromatosis [^112SQPtX].

---

Iron studies include serum iron, ferritin, transferrin or TIBC, TSAT, and CBC with red cell indices, with additional tests such as sTfR, Ret-He, and CRP/ESR as needed [^116cC5xS]. Interpretation requires **clinical context**, including inflammation and chronic disease considerations [^111sFJG3].

### Implementing reticulocyte hemoglobin into current hematology algorithms [^112rkjre]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2022). Low credibility.

This systematic review investigates reticulocyte hemoglobin's capabilities in screening iron deficiency and iron-deficiency anemia with and without comorbidities.

- **Methods**: Participant background and laboratory characteristics were extracted from 14 unique studies between 2015 and 2022. Hemoglobin, reticulocyte hemoglobin, and mean cell volume (MCV) values were used in a meta-analysis for iron-deficiency anemia with no secondary conditions. Mean laboratory values for each patient population were calculated and then used to determine sensitivity, specificity, and the area under the curve (AUC) for iron deficiency and iron-deficiency anemia. The ferritin and reticulocyte hemoglobin ranges were calculated using the mean values.

- **Results**: The meta-analysis demonstrates that hemoglobin and MCV values do not significantly differ between studies, unlike reticulocyte hemoglobin values. The reticulocyte hemoglobin range is smaller than ferritin for the controls, iron deficiency, and iron-deficiency anemia. Reticulocyte hemoglobin values less than 26 pg can distinguish iron-deficiency anemia, while 26 to 31.5 pg can distinguish iron deficiency, with an AUC of 0.889. The sensitivity and specificity are 92.3% and 100% for iron-deficiency anemia, 100% and 81.5% for iron deficiency, and 94.4% and 71.4% for both, respectively (reference range, < 31.5 pg).

- **Conclusions**: Reticulocyte hemoglobin is potentially a quick screening test for iron deficiency and iron-deficiency anemia.

### British Society of Gastroenterology guidelines for the management of iron deficiency anaemia in adults [^116Ln8KB]. Gut (2021). Low credibility.

Automated cell counters provide measurements of the changes in red cells that accompany iron deficiency, including reduced mean cell hemoglobin (MCH), referred to as hypochromia, and reduced mean cell volume (MCV), known as microcytosis. MCH is likely a more reliable marker of iron deficiency as it is less dependent on storage and the counting machine used. A reduction is seen in both absolute and functional iron deficiency (FID). MCH may also be more sensitive for iron deficiency than MCV. Both microcytosis and hypochromia lose sensitivity for iron deficiency in the presence of chronic disease, thalassemia, or vitamin B12/folate deficiency.

The specificity of MCV and MCH for iron deficiency is limited because microcytosis and hypochromia also occur in many hemoglobinopathies, such as thalassemia, where MCV is typically reduced out of proportion to the level of anemia. They are also observed in sideroblastic anemia and some cases of anemia of chronic disease. To prevent unnecessary gastrointestinal investigation, hemoglobin electrophoresis is recommended in individuals with microcytosis and normal iron studies, particularly if there is an appropriate ethnic background.

Serum markers of iron deficiency include low ferritin, low transferrin saturation, low iron, raised total iron-binding capacity, raised red cell zinc protoporphyrin, increased serum transferrin receptor (sTfR), low reticulocyte hemoglobin (Retic-Hb), and raised percentage of hypochromic red cells. Serum ferritin (SF) is the most specific test for iron deficiency in the absence of inflammation. An SF level of < 15 µg/L is indicative of absent iron stores.

### Best but not perfect: Indirect measure of low iron stores [^115WFgXM]. Blood Advances (2025). Low credibility.

Although making the correct diagnosis of iron deficiency is critical for patient care, the use of indirect markers obtained through routine phlebotomy presents a challenge. Low serum iron, transferrin saturation, hemoglobin, and mean corpuscular volume (MCV) are characteristic of iron deficiency but can also result from inflammation. In addition, hemoglobin and MCV may be low due to genetic causes and, in the case of hemoglobin, to diurnal variation rather than iron deficiency. Transferrin concentrations tend to increase with iron deficiency and decrease with inflammation, whereas transferrin receptor levels rise with both iron deficiency and inflammation.

Serum ferritin is an attractive marker because a very low level (< 10 μg/L) is diagnostic of iron deficiency, as documented by absent stainable iron in a bone marrow aspirate. However, serum ferritin can be normal or even elevated when iron deficiency is documented by absent bone marrow stainable iron. A recent Cochrane review of 512 adults presenting for medical care at various institutions found that a serum ferritin < 30 μg/L had 98% specificity and 79% sensitivity for diagnosing iron deficiency, as documented by absent bone marrow iron.

Lahtiharju et al. make a remarkable contribution by evaluating the relationship of indirect measures of iron status to bone marrow iron stain in 6,610 patients and providing evidence that ferritin is the most reliable single biomarker for predicting reduced iron stores. This finding is consistent with studies dated decades ago that established ferritin as a key standalone indicator of iron status.

### The association between iron deficiency and outcomes: A secondary analysis of the intravenous iron therapy to treat iron deficiency anaemia in patients undergoing major abdominal surgery (PREVENTT) trial [^114SScp5]. Anaesthesia (2023). High credibility.

Eligibility for the PREVENTT trial was determined in part by local laboratory results: patients were required to have a haemoglobin concentration ≥ 90 g/l but ≤ 120 g/l in women or 130 g/l in men in the 4 weeks before randomisation. Additional blood samples were taken at randomisation before administration of the study drug and subsequently on the day of planned surgery for central laboratory analysis. These samples, EDTA (for a full blood count examination) and serum (for iron studies), were processed locally before courier transfer to a central laboratory for analysis (The Doctors Laboratory, London, UK; Sysmex xe‐2100 automated haematology system). Clinical and research staff and participants were blinded to the results.

For subgroup analyses of iron deficiency, patients were categorised as absolute iron deficiency (ferritin ≤ 30 μg/l), functional iron deficiency (ferritin 30–100 μg/l or TSAT > 20%). As there is no consensus on the definitions of absolute/functional/inflammatory iron deficiency or anaemia of chronic disease, the parameters were agreed by the Trial Steering Committee at the start of the trial and in the statistical analysis plan. Participants were also categorised on the basis of: serum ferritin (≤ 30 μg/l; 30–100 μg/l; ≥ 100 μg/l); TSAT (< 20% or ≥ 20%); MCV (< 80 fl or ≥ 80 fl); and MCH (< 27 pg or ≥ 27 pg).

### Shortcomings in infant iron deficiency screening methods [^112uZxpo]. Pediatrics (2006). Low credibility.

Screening for iron deficiency anemia is a well-established practice in pediatrics, but numerous challenges surrounding recommendations raise questions about the effectiveness of this strategy.

- **Objective**: To evaluate iron deficiency anemia screening approaches by assessing rates of follow-up testing and resolution among patients meeting screening criteria in a primary care setting.

- **Methods**: A retrospective cohort study was performed. We extracted electronic medical record data on complete blood counts for infants who received primary care in our clinics in the past 10 years. We calculated rates of positive screening results with 9 different measurement criteria and determined rates of follow-up testing and of documented correction of iron deficiency among those who screened positive.

- **Results**: Our cohort consisted of 4,984 children who were screened at 9 to 15 months of age, between 1994 and 2004. There was a wide distribution of positive detection rates (range: 1.5–14.5%) among the 9 screening criteria. Follow-up testing rates were low. No more than 25% of infants who screened positive by any criterion underwent a repeat complete blood count within 6 months. Moreover, no more than 11.6% (range: 4.4–11.6%) had documented correction of their laboratory abnormalities.

- **Conclusions**: Significant shortcomings exist in iron deficiency anemia screening practices. A widely agreed upon, specific, and inexpensive screening criterion, with increased emphasis on systems-based approaches to iron deficiency screening, is needed.

### Suboptimal iron deficiency screening in pregnancy and the impact of socioeconomic status in a high-resource setting [^113pgby3]. Blood Advances (2021). Low credibility.

This study was a retrospective cohort population-based analysis of pregnant females aged 13 to 54 years in Ontario, Canada, with laboratory testing between January 2013 and June 2018. Anonymized laboratory data were obtained from Dynacare, the second-largest private laboratory enterprise in Ontario, Canada, representing approximately one-third of nonhospital laboratory testing in the province. Data included laboratory test dates and results, patient age, sex, postal code, and ordering provider specialty. The data were obtained from Dynacare at no cost and without restrictions. Dynacare was not involved in study design, data analysis, nor in manuscript preparation. Study approval was granted by the research ethics board at St. Michael's Hospital, and the study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Further details on the study population are available in the supplemental materials.

Pregnancy was inferred from the co-occurrence of a Rubella and ABO/Rh test (referred to as the "index date"), followed by a Group B Streptococcus (GBS) swab at least 4 months and no more than 8 months following the index date. Further details are available in the supplemental data. The definition of pregnancy was validated using a cohort of 1000 females who had β-human chorionic gonadotropin (β-HCG) testing at Dynacare between January 2016 and March 2017.

### Pruritus: Diagnosis and management [^115sC2c5]. American Family Physician (2022). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for pruritus, the 2022 guidelines by the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) recommend considering the following laboratory tests when pruritus is undifferentiated after the initial evaluation: complete blood count (CBC), iron tests, liver and kidney function tests, thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), and fasting glucose or HbA1c.

### British Society of Gastroenterology guidelines for the management of iron deficiency anaemia in adults [^113DECq2]. Gut (2021). High credibility.

In summary, an SF < 15 µg/L is highly specific for iron deficiency (specificity 0.99). A cut-off of 45 µg/L provides a respectable specificity of 0.92, and figures below this may warrant consideration of GI investigation, especially in the context of a chronic inflammatory process with anaemia.

The sTfR concentration is a good marker of iron deficiency in otherwise healthy subjects, but it can also be raised where there is increased erythropoietic drive, such as with haemolytic anaemias, thalassaemias, and Hb E — and most UK hospitals do not provide this test. The [sTfR/log₁₀ ferritin] ratio may provide superior discrimination to either test on its own, particularly in chronic disease.

A therapeutic trial of oral iron replacement therapy (IRT) for 2–4 weeks may aid with the diagnosis of IDA, but is dependent on compliance. A ≥ 10 g/L rise in Hb over a 2-week period is highly sensitive for absolute iron deficiency. While further tests to confirm iron deficiency are occasionally necessary, estimation of iron concentration in bone marrow is invasive, often subjective, and difficult to justify in most cases.

After excluding thalassaemia carriage, low Retic-Hb provides evidence of iron restriction and should be considered in the laboratory work-up of anaemia, particularly where there is chronic renal impairment. Retic-Hb is reported to be a more reliable marker of iron restriction than sTfR in healthy blood donors. An early indicator of response to iron therapy in IDA is provided by a rising Retic-Hb on day 4, similar to the observation of a falling percentage of hypochromic red cells.

### Iron deficiency: A concise review [^114q2zV3]. American Journal of Hematology (2005). Low credibility.

Iron deficiency is a major worldwide health problem. Recent evidence suggests that anemia is only the final manifestation of the syndrome, with symptoms occurring even before anemia becomes apparent. Although advances have been made in understanding the physiology of iron deficiency, significant gaps remain. Oral iron supplementation continues to be the primary treatment; however, there are now certain indications for intravenous administration.

This review will highlight the epidemiology, physiology, clinical presentation, and treatment options for iron deficiency.

### Case studies: iron [^111tENc1]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2011). Low credibility.

Iron biomarkers were developed to define the size of iron stores and the adequacy of the iron supply required to meet functional needs. Approximately 80% of the iron delivered to tissues through the circulating plasma pool will be incorporated into hemoglobin. Consequently, with the exception of serum ferritin, iron biomarkers are measures of iron sufficiency for erythrocyte production. They have proven to be very valuable in determining the cause of anemia in the clinical setting, where additional information about factors affecting the patient's health is available.

However, all biomarkers are affected by factors other than iron status, which limits their utility for determining the prevalence of iron deficiency in some populations, particularly in developing countries. Furthermore, the relationships between iron status and functional outcomes such as neonatal and infant mortality; motor, cognitive, and emotional development in infants; and severe morbidity from malaria in young children are inadequately characterized.

There is a need to identify and standardize biomarkers with the highest predictive value for specific functional outcomes in each setting. The most appropriate biomarkers may vary depending on the setting and be influenced by age, sex, gestational stage of pregnancy, and environmental factors such as repeated or chronic infections. There is also an urgent need for improved technology to permit the use of specific biomarkers in field studies in resource-poor regions. Finally, more research is required to define the…

### Intravenous iron administration: New observations and time for the next steps [^115wZcux]. Kidney International (2015). Low credibility.

In this issue of *Kidney International*, the Dialysis Outcomes and Practice Patterns Study reports that hemodialysis patients with monthly intravenous iron supplementation of 300–399 mg or ⩾400 mg had a 13% or 18% higher risk of dying, respectively, compared with those receiving 100–199 mg per month, with no obvious differences in cause-specific mortalities. This study supports that randomized controlled trials are urgently needed to identify optimized iron supplementation strategies for anemic dialysis patients.

### Serum or plasma ferritin concentration as an index of iron deficiency and overload [^1157g8j4]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). High credibility.

Reference standard indices of iron deficiency and iron overload are generally invasive, expensive, and can be unpleasant or occasionally risky. Ferritin is an iron storage protein, and its concentration in the plasma or serum reflects iron stores. Low ferritin indicates iron deficiency, while elevated ferritin reflects the risk of iron overload. However, ferritin is also an acute-phase protein, and its levels are elevated in inflammation and infection. The use of ferritin as a diagnostic test for iron deficiency and overload is a common clinical practice.

- **Objectives**: To determine the diagnostic accuracy of ferritin concentrations (serum or plasma) for detecting iron deficiency and the risk of iron overload in primary and secondary iron-loading syndromes.

- **Search methods**: We searched the following databases (10 June 2020):

	- **Cochrane Library**: DARE Issue 2 of 4 2015, HTA Issue 4 of 4 2016, CENTRAL Issue 6 of 12 2020

	- **OVID databases**: MEDLINE 1946 to 9 June 2020, Embase 1947 to week 23 2020

	- **Other scientific databases**: CINAHL (Ebsco) 1982 to June 2020, Web of Science (ISI) SCI, SSCI, CPCI-exp & CPCI-SSH to June 2020

	- **Additional resources**: POPLINE 16/8/18, Open Grey (10/6/20), TRoPHI (10/6/20), Bibliomap (10/6/20), IBECS (10/6/20), SCIELO (10/6/20)

	- **Global health indices**: Global Index Medicus (10/6/20) AIM, IMSEAR, WPRIM, IMEMR, LILACS (10/6/20), PAHO (10/6/20), WHOLIS 10/6/20

	- **Regional and specialized databases**: IndMED (16/8/18), Native Health Research Database (10/6/20)

	We also searched two trial registers and contacted relevant organizations for unpublished studies.

- **Selection criteria**: We included all study designs seeking to evaluate serum.

### Physiologically based serum ferritin thresholds for iron deficiency in women of reproductive age who are blood donors [^115E9d7Z]. Blood Advances (2022). Low credibility.

The criteria for selecting apparently healthy populations, the laboratory methods, and the sample sizes and model explained variance differed between the REDS-RISE and NHANES studies. Volunteer blood donors are a healthy, altruistic, specially selected subset of the general population. After applying 38 required donor exclusion criteria, only an estimated 62.6% of the total US population aged 18 years or older is eligible to donate blood. In the REDS-RISE study, participants were not screened for biochemical evidence of inflammation or liver disease but did undergo an additional clinical screening and donated successfully. In contrast, NHANES study participants were a subset of a stratified multistage probability sample of the US population that was no longer nationally representative after exclusions for missing values and for common causes of anemia at the population level that are independent of iron deficiency. The laboratory methods in the two studies were not identical but were of high quality. The number of participants in the two study populations differ by an order of magnitude. Despite these differences, the serum ferritin thresholds for iron deficiency in the two independent studies do not differ significantly and are nearly identical.

International validation of the physiologically based method is needed. Nonetheless, the results of the REDS-RISE study add to evidence that, in women of reproductive age, iron-deficient erythropoiesis begins well before the WHO guideline of a serum ferritin of 15 µg/L. A higher serum ferritin threshold would increase the proportion of women at risk of iron deficiency.

### Iron quantification with susceptibility [^113WdDaw]. NMR in Biomedicine (2017). Low credibility.

Iron is an essential trace element involved in a variety of biological mechanisms in the human body. Disturbances of iron homeostasis have been observed in several inflammatory and degenerative diseases, raising strong interest in non-invasive iron mapping techniques. Numerous MRI techniques have been proposed, primarily based on the field changes induced by the magnetic properties of iron. Each of these approaches has a specific sensitivity to iron and its microstructural environment. Quantitative susceptibility mapping is the latest development, providing a direct measure of bulk susceptibility. However, field changes induced by iron do not always directly relate to the concentration of iron; instead, they often reflect the structure of iron compounds and their cellular distribution.

This review provides an overview of the most relevant iron compounds in the human body, their magnetic properties, and their cellular distribution. In addition, MRI methods based on direct or indirect susceptibility changes are presented and discussed concerning technical aspects and clinical applicability.

### A systematic review and meta-analysis of the correlation between maternal and neonatal iron status and haematologic indices [^117WMBek]. EClinicalMedicine (2020). Low credibility.

The study examines the relationship between maternal and neonatal iron status by reviewing existing literature on haematologic indices. This systematic review and meta-analysis contribute to understanding how maternal iron levels may impact neonatal health. It highlights the need for further research to develop targeted interventions for improving maternal and neonatal health outcomes.

- **Risk of bias of included studies**: The risk of bias of individual studies is summarized in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3. The risk of bias was low in seven studies, moderate in 28 studies, and high in 30 studies. Overall, cross-sectional studies had a high risk of bias in the two comparability domains, moderate risk of bias in the domains relating to the representativeness of the exposed cohort and selection of non-exposed cohort, and low risk of bias in domains that related to ascertainment of exposure and demonstration that the outcome of interest was not present at the start of the study. Conversely, cohort studies had a high risk of bias in domains related to comparability bias (i.e. whether studies controlled for important factors), moderate risk of bias in domains that assessed selection of non-exposed cohort, and loss of cohort to follow-up. Finally, there was a low risk of bias among cohort studies in the domains that assessed representativeness of the exposed cohort, ascertainment of exposure, demonstration that the outcome of interest was not present at the start of the study, independent blind assessment of outcome, and whether follow-up time was sufficient for the outcome to occur. Overall, the quality of the evidence to inform the association between maternal and neonatal iron status and haematologic indices was very low (see Supplementary Table 2 for a summary of GRADE evidence profile).

### Iron through the prism of haematology [^113Cw9ui]. British Journal of Haematology (2020). Low credibility.

Since the inception of the British Society for Haematology (BSH) 60 years ago, our increased scientific understanding of iron metabolism, together with clinical developments, has changed the way we diagnose and treat its disorders. In the UK, perhaps the most notable contributions relate to iron overload, some of which I will outline from personal experience. Diagnostically, this began with the identification of serum ferritin as a marker of iron overload and continued later with the application of MRI-based imaging techniques for iron and its distribution. Therapeutically, the first trials of both parenteral and oral chelation, which have radically changed the outcomes of transfusional iron-overloaded patients, took place in the UK and are now part of standard clinical practice. During this time, our scientific understanding of iron metabolism at a cellular and systemic level has advanced the diagnosis and treatment of inherited disorders of iron metabolism. There are potential novel applications related to our recent understanding of hepcidin metabolism and manipulation.

### Screening of iron deficiency anaemia in early childhood [^113kgfmx]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Low credibility.

Existing evidence

Two systematic reviews were recently commissioned by the USPSTF and the UK NSC to update their 2006 and 2012 recommendations, respectively, based on the latest evidence available.

The USPSTF review included trials and control observational studies assessing screening in children between six and 24 months of age conducted in developed countries, as well as the effectiveness and harms of routine iron supplementation, and the association between a change in iron status and improvement in child health outcomes. Studies conducted in resource-poor populations were excluded. Notably, the focus was on studies involving iron supplementation and treatment regimens commonly used in clinical practice in the US. The literature search was conducted up to August 2014 with the aim to identify new studies to update the previous USPSTF systematic reviews. Review authors identified ten new studies addressing routine iron supplementation (which is beyond the scope of this summary) and no new study addressing any of the key questions established on screening for IDA. An update of the search was conducted in June 2018 and identified one study, but this study did not address the key questions on IDA screening. For each key question below, we therefore summarized the available evidence from studies identified from the previous USPSTF systematic reviews.

The UK NSC structured the review in four key questions to assess the evidence supporting IDA screening in children under five years of age. The review authors included different types of studies for each.

### Iron status in patients with burn anaemia [^115WvYLa]. Burns (2023). Low credibility.

The iron status of burn patients is poorly understood due to the difficulty of interpreting conventional iron studies in the context of the acute phase response triggered by critical illness. The aim of this study was to evaluate the iron status of patients with burn anaemia using recent post-operative guidelines.

- **Methodology**: This retrospective cohort study utilized data collected from records for adult patients admitted to the Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital with burns covering at least 15% of the total body surface area (TBSA). Rates of iron deficiency, defined as ferritin levels less than 100 µg/L or ferritin 100–300 µg/L with transferrin saturation less than 20%, and low iron availability, defined as transferrin saturation less than 20%, were calculated.

- **Results**: Of 60 included patients (90% male), 16 (27%) underwent iron studies. Eleven (18%) were treated with intravenous iron. Iron studies showed that five (31%) patients had evidence of iron deficiency, and ten out of 12 (83%) had evidence of reduced iron availability. Two patients (40%) with evidence of iron deficiency were not treated with intravenous iron.

- **Conclusion**: The application of recent guidelines for the interpretation of conventional iron studies in patients with inflammatory states may improve the identification of iron deficiency in burn patients. Iron deficiency may be an under-recognized and under-treated contributor to burn anaemia.

### Screening and routine supplementation for iron deficiency anemia: A systematic review [^1177MwVK]. Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Supplementation and screening for iron-deficiency anemia (IDA) in young children may improve growth and development outcomes. The goal of this study was to review the evidence regarding the benefits and harms of screening and routine supplementation for IDA for the US Preventive Services Task Force.

- **Methods**: We searched Medline and Cochrane databases (1996-August 2014), as well as reference lists of relevant systematic reviews. We included trials and controlled observational studies regarding the effectiveness and harms of routine iron supplementation and screening in children ages 6 to 24 months conducted in developed countries. One author extracted data, which were checked for accuracy by a second author. Dual quality assessment was performed.

- **Results**: No studies of iron supplementation in young children reported on the diagnosis of neurodevelopmental delay. Five of six trials, which sparsely reported various growth outcomes, found no clear benefit of supplementation. After three to twelve months, Bayley Scales of Infant Development scores were not significantly different in two trials. Ten trials assessing iron supplementation in children reported inconsistent findings for hematologic measures. Evidence regarding the harms of supplementation was limited but did not indicate significant differences. No studies assessed the benefits or harms of screening or the association between improvement in impaired iron status and clinical outcomes. Studies may have been underpowered, and control factors varied and could have confounded results.

- **Conclusions**: Although some evidence exists, it remains inconclusive regarding the routine implementation of iron supplementation and screening for IDA in young children. Further research may be necessary to determine any potential benefits or harms effectively.

### Ferritin outperforms other biomarkers in predicting bone marrow iron stores in patients with hematologic disorders [^111nbrx1]. Blood Advances (2025). Low credibility.

One-fourth of the world's population is currently experiencing anemia. The World Health Organization defines anemia as a hemoglobin concentration of less than 130 g/L for males, 120 g/L for nonpregnant females, and 110 g/L for pregnant females. The most common cause of anemia is iron deficiency, contributing to approximately half of the cases in females worldwide and more than half of the cases in high-income regions. Iron-deficiency anemia (IDA) is associated with increased mortality and morbidity. Reliable detection of iron deficiency is clinically important as it may indicate other diseases, such as gastrointestinal cancer.

Given that iron is stored in the bone marrow, bone marrow aspiration has been considered the gold standard for diagnosing iron deficiency. However, it is invasive and costly. More commonly, surrogate plasma or serum biomarkers are used to assess anemia and iron stores: ferritin, transferrin saturation (TSAT), soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR), and hemoglobin and erythrocyte mean cell volume (MCV). These biomarkers have high diagnostic accuracy in diagnosing IDA within the healthy adult population. However, interpretation of these laboratory tests is not always straightforward, with multiple confounding factors, including patient-specific, preanalytical, and analytical laboratory assay considerations. For example, inflammation can increase ferritin concentrations and decrease TSAT, while erythropoietic activity affects sTfR levels. Cutoffs are dependent on the reference population and laboratory methods, and there is a lack of consensus on their use in patients.

### Iron absorption from oral iron supplements given on consecutive versus alternate days and as single morning doses versus twice-daily split dosing in iron-depleted women: two open-label, randomised controlled trials [^113wixRU]. The Lancet Haematology (2017). High credibility.

Guidelines to treat iron deficiency recommend the daily provision of ferrous iron, divided throughout the day to increase absorption. However, daily dosing and split dosing might increase serum hepcidin and decrease iron absorption from subsequent doses. Our study aimed to compare iron absorption from oral iron supplements given on consecutive versus alternate days, and as single morning doses versus twice-daily split dosing.

We conducted two prospective, open-label, randomised controlled trials assessing iron absorption using (54 Fe)-labelled, (57 Fe)-labelled, or (58 Fe)-labelled ferrous sulfate in iron-depleted (serum ferritin ≤ 25 μg/L) women aged 18–40 years, recruited from ETH Zurich and the University of Zurich, Switzerland.

In study 1, women were randomly assigned (1:1) to two groups. One group was given 60 mg of iron at 0800 h (± 1 h) on consecutive days for 14 days, and the other group was given the same doses on alternate days for 28 days.

In study 2, women were assigned to two groups, stratified by serum ferritin so that two groups with similar iron statuses could be formed. One group was given 120 mg of iron at 0800 h (± 1 h) and the other was given the dose split into two divided doses of 60 mg at 0800 h (± 1 h) and 1700 h (± 1 h) for three consecutive days. Fourteen days after the final dose, the groups were crossed over to the other regimen.

Within-individual comparisons were done. The co-primary outcomes in both studies were iron bioavailability (total and fractional iron absorption), assessed by measuring the isotopic label abundance in erythrocytes.

Concerning the medical management of chronic kidney disease, particularly with regard to the management of anemia and iron therapy, the KDIGO 2012 guidelines recommend guiding subsequent iron administration in patients with CKD based on various factors. These factors include hemoglobin responses to recent iron therapy, ongoing blood losses, results from iron status tests like transferrin saturation and ferritin, hemoglobin concentration, ESA (erythropoiesis-stimulating agent) responsiveness and dose in ESA-treated patients, trends in each parameter, and the patient's clinical status.

### Guidelines for the management of iron deficiency anaemia [^117GJGKa]. Gut (2011). Low credibility.

Iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) affects 2–5% of adult men and postmenopausal women in the developed world and is a common cause of referral to gastroenterologists. Gastrointestinal (GI) blood loss from colonic or gastric cancer, and malabsorption in coeliac disease, are the most important causes that need to be sought.

- **Defining iron deficiency anaemia**: The lower limit of the normal range for the laboratory performing the test should define anaemia. Any level of anaemia should be investigated in the presence of iron deficiency. The lower the haemoglobin, the more likely there is to be serious underlying pathology, and the more urgent is the need for investigation. Red cell indices provide a sensitive indication of iron deficiency in the absence of chronic disease or haemoglobinopathy. Haemoglobin electrophoresis is recommended when microcytosis and hypochromia are present in patients of appropriate ethnic background, to prevent unnecessary GI investigation. Serum ferritin is the most powerful test for iron deficiency.

- **Investigations**: Upper and lower GI investigations should be considered in all postmenopausal female and all male patients where IDA has been confirmed, unless there is a history of significant overt non-GI blood loss. All patients should be screened for coeliac disease. If oesophagogastroduodenoscopy (OGD) is performed as the initial GI investigation, only the presence of advanced gastric cancer or coeliac disease should deter lower GI investigation.

### British society of gastroenterology guidelines for the management of iron deficiency anaemia in adults [^115bHVQo]. Gut (2021). Low credibility.

- **Executive summary of recommendations and practice statements**: Iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) is common and a major cause of morbidity worldwide (evidence quality — high, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong). IDA can be caused by a range of GI pathologies including cancer, and GI investigation on an urgent basis should be considered in adults with a new diagnosis of IDA without obvious explanation (evidence quality — high, consensus — 85%, statement strength — strong).

- **Definitions**: We recommend that anaemia is defined as a haemoglobin (Hb) concentration below the lower limit of normal for the relevant population and laboratory performing the test (evidence quality — medium, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong). We recommend that iron deficiency should be confirmed by iron studies prior to investigation. Serum ferritin is the single most useful marker of IDA, but other blood tests (e.g. transferrin saturation) can be helpful if a false-normal ferritin is suspected (evidence quality — medium, consensus — 92%, statement strength — strong). We recommend that a good response to iron therapy (Hb rise ≥ 10 g/L within a 2-week timeframe) in anaemic patients is highly suggestive of absolute iron deficiency, even if the results of iron studies are equivocal (evidence quality — medium, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong).

### Hepcidin in the diagnosis of iron disorders [^115Rvodh]. Blood (2016). High credibility.

The discovery of the iron-regulatory hormone hepcidin in 2001 has revolutionized our understanding of iron disorders, and its measurement should advance the diagnosis and treatment of these conditions. Although several assays have been developed, a gold standard is still lacking, and efforts toward harmonization are ongoing. Nevertheless, promising applications can already be glimpsed, ranging from the use of hepcidin levels for diagnosing iron-refractory iron deficiency anemia to global health applications such as guiding safe iron supplementation in developing countries with a high infection burden.

### Iron-deficiency anemia [^111sFJG3]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2015). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on iron deficiency anemia:

- **Definition**: IDA is a form of anemia that results from inadequate iron supply for erythropoiesis and is defined as a hemoglobin level two standard deviations below normal with evidence of low body iron stores.

- **Pathophysiology**: IDA can be caused by factors such as increased iron demand (e.g. pregnancy, infancy), insufficient iron intake, decreased iron absorption (e.g. IBD, gastrectomy), chronic blood loss (e.g. menorrhagia, systemic bleeding, hookworm infection), use of certain drugs (e.g. NSAIDs, corticosteroids), genetics (e.g. iron-refractory IDA), and iron-restricted erythropoiesis (e.g. CKD).

- **Epidemiology**: In the US, the prevalence of iron deficiency ranges from 4.5–18.0%, while the prevalence of IDA is estimated at 2.9%.

- **Disease course**: IDA typically presents with hypochromic, microcytic erythrocytes. Clinical manifestations are related to the severity of the anemia and may additionally include restless leg syndrome, decreased quality of life, and increased maternal and newborn mortality.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Iron deficiency is an independent predictor of cardiovascular events in patients with coronary artery disease. Iron deficiency is also a risk factor for all-cause mortality in patients with CKD. IDA is associated with morbidity and mortality in pregnant women.

### A 5-step root cause analysis model for test overutilization: A study on its application to plasma transferrin testing [^112QwLgq]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2024). High credibility.

Laboratory test overutilization is characterized by the ordering of tests whose results are either irrelevant or not beneficial to patient care. A meta-analysis discovered that overutilization constituted approximately 20% of all tests. This issue poses a significant challenge in medicine as it can lead to additional costs and indirectly influences patient care, such as patient anxiety, unnecessary blood collection, competition with the necessary test, and misdiagnosis. From a laboratory perspective, this problem is called a "pre-preanalytical laboratory error", and it is the most prevalent type of laboratory error in real-world practice.

Comparable to other laboratories, the central laboratory of the Department of Clinical Pathology at the Faculty of Medicine Siriraj Hospital encounters test overutilization issues, one of which involves plasma transferrin. A recent study demonstrated that plasma transferrin does not provide supplementary information when co-ordered with iron studies (serum iron, total iron-binding capacity) and ferritin tests in anemic patients. Furthermore, transferrin levels exhibit low accuracy in diagnosing and treating iron deficiency anemia. As a result, plasma transferrin is considered redundant and overused in the context of iron deficiency anemia.

The growing awareness of laboratory test overuse within the health care community has led to the development of numerous methods to address this issue. In the context of quality improvement management, these methods are referred to as laboratory utilization management (LUM) or demand management.

### Consensus statement on the definition and classification of metabolic hyperferritinaemia [^115VwBva]. Nature Reviews Endocrinology (2023). High credibility.

Hyperferritinaemia is a common laboratory finding often associated with metabolic dysfunction and fatty liver. Metabolic hyperferritinaemia reflects alterations in iron metabolism that facilitate iron accumulation in the body and is associated with an increased risk of cardiometabolic and liver diseases. Genetic variants that modulate iron homeostasis and tissue levels of iron are the main determinants of serum ferritin levels in individuals with metabolic dysfunction, raising the hypothesis that iron accumulation might be implicated in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance and the related organ damage.

However, validated criteria for the non-invasive diagnosis of metabolic hyperferritinaemia and the staging of iron overload are still lacking, and there is no clear evidence of a benefit for iron depletion therapy. Here, we provide an overview of the literature on the relationship between hyperferritinaemia and iron accumulation in individuals with metabolic dysfunction, and on the associated clinical outcomes. We propose an updated definition and a provisional staging system for metabolic hyperferritinaemia, which has been agreed upon by a multidisciplinary global panel of expert researchers. The goal is to foster studies into the epidemiology, genetics, pathophysiology, clinical relevance, and treatment of metabolic hyperferritinaemia, for which we provide suggestions on the main unmet needs, optimal design, and clinically relevant outcomes.

### A diagnostic approach to hyperferritinemia with a non-elevated transferrin saturation [^114SLmej]. Journal of Hepatology (2011). Low credibility.

Elevated serum ferritin concentrations are common in clinical practice. In this review, we provide an approach to interpreting serum ferritin elevation in relation to other clinical parameters, including patient history, transferrin saturation, serum concentrations of alanine and aspartate aminotransferases (ALT, AST), testing for HFE mutations, liver imaging, liver biopsy, and liver iron concentration. We utilized observations from a large series of patients with hepatic iron overload, documented by liver iron concentration measurement from two referral practices, as a gold standard to guide the interpretation of the predictive values of non-invasive iron tests. Three case studies illustrate common problems in interpreting iron blood tests.

### A randomised comparison of deferasirox versus deferoxamine for the treatment of transfusional iron overload in sickle cell disease [^112jvJEw]. British Journal of Haematology (2007). Low credibility.

Safety assessments were conducted through monthly laboratory evaluations, which included complete blood counts with differential counts. Biochemical testing covered electrolytes, glucose, liver function tests, gamma-glutamyl transferase, lactate dehydrogenase, cholesterol, triglycerides, uric acid, total protein, C-reactive protein, copper, and zinc levels. Iron parameters such as total iron, transferrin, transferrin saturation, and ferritin were also measured. Urinary testing on random collections involved determining creatinine, total protein, and albumin levels. Physical examinations, electrocardiograms (ECGs), audiometry, and ophthalmological tests were conducted at baseline, 12, 24, 36, and 52 weeks. Additional assessments for patients under 16 years of age included growth velocity and pubertal stage evaluation.

- **Efficacy assessments**: Liver iron concentration (LIC) was determined by SQUID biosusceptometry at baseline, 24, and 52 weeks. The 24-week assessment primarily addressed safety, and the change in LIC was calculated between baseline and 52 weeks. Serum ferritin levels were assessed monthly, and changes were determined using baseline and final ferritin levels.

- **Compliance**: For deferasirox, compliance was evaluated by counting the number of tablets returned in bottles at each visit. For deferoxamine, the number of vials returned at each visit was counted.

- **Statistical analysis**: Data analysis was conducted under the supervision of the trial statistician and reviewed by investigators. The sample size was calculated based on the number of deferasirox-treated patients.

### Iron deficiency resolution and time to resolution in an American health system [^113YGVzf]. Blood Advances (2024). Low credibility.

Within the Clinical and Translational Science Institute clinical data repository, patients aged ≥ 18 years who had a laboratory diagnosis of iron deficiency (ID) (with or without anemia) within the MHFV system since 2010 were eligible for inclusion. We sought to construct a cohort of patients with (1) laboratory evidence of ID, (2) regular care in the MHFV system, and (3) enough follow-up time to allow for documented resolution of ID with treatment.

- **Laboratory evidence of ID**: We defined ID as a ferritin value of ≤ 25 ng/mL. A ferritin value in this range is highly predictive of ID. Although there is disagreement about the ferritin level that can be considered diagnostic of ID, we chose 25 ng/mL as a conservative threshold with a physiologic basis, and it is currently accepted in clinical practice.

- **Regular care in the MHFV system**: We included patients with at least two ferritin values (one initial value of ≤ 25 ng/mL and at least one subsequent value) measured in the MHFV system. The second value was required to occur at least two months after the initial value and no later than three years after the initial value. These criteria are intended to signify both ongoing engagement with the MHFV system — suggesting opportunities for diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up on treatment efficacy — and that providers caring for a given patient considered the diagnosis of ID multiple times in a three-year period.

- **Sufficient follow-up time for documented resolution**: Patients were required to have three years of follow-up data available after diagnosis.

### Intravenous iron reactions: Insights from an allergy and immunology perspective [^116VkRhp]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology Global (2025). High credibility.

Diagnosis and management of intravenous iron reactions is often challenging, as skin testing has unproven utility and most reactions are non-IgE-mediated. We aimed to identify clinical patterns and tolerability predictors in patients with reactions to intravenous iron.

- **Methods**: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients with reactions to intravenous iron referred to the Vanderbilt University Medical Center Drug Allergy Clinic from April 2014 through January 2025. A follow-up survey was administered via RedCap to evaluate patient outcomes with future intravenous iron administration.

- **Results**: Of the 51 patients presenting with adverse reactions to intravenous iron, 48 underwent skin testing, which was negative in all cases (100%). Notable laboratory test results within one year of the reaction included low vitamin D levels (47%), high parathyroid hormone levels (46%), and low phosphorus levels (10%). Many patients (56%) exhibited dermatographism, with drug alert labels including opioids (31%), fluoroquinolones (14%), and radiocontrast dye (8%). Following assessment, 31 patients (61%) received intravenous iron using formulations that were either the same (n = 15 [48%]) or different from (n = 17 [55%]) the initially implicated formulation, with modifications such as antihistamines, slower infusion rates, and intravenous fluid pretreatment. Of these 31 patients, 27 (87%) tolerated the infusions. Additionally, following evaluation, patients were surveyed regarding subsequent intravenous iron administration.

### Iron supplementation, response in iron-deficiency anemia: Analysis of five trials [^1163DhwD]. The American Journal of Medicine (2017). High credibility.

Oral iron-replacement therapy is the mainstay of treatment for iron-deficiency anemia, but it is often poorly tolerated or ineffective. Hemoglobin response at day 14 of oral iron may be useful in assessing whether and when to transition patients from oral to intravenous (IV) iron.

- **Methods**: Pooled data from 5 randomized trials were analyzed to compare oral and IV iron-replacement therapy for iron-deficiency anemia. Treatment criteria and assignment to oral versus IV iron were defined per protocol; this analysis included only subjects receiving oral iron. Responders were subjects with ≥ 1.0-g/dL increases in hemoglobin at day 14, and nonresponders were those with smaller increases. Demographic and clinical characteristics were evaluated for association with hemoglobin response at multiple timepoints.

- **Results**: Most subjects (72.8%) were classified as responders. The proportion of subjects with hemoglobin increases ≥ 1.0, ≥ 2.0, and ≥ 3.0 g/dL was greatest among those with postpartum anemia, intermediate among those with heavy uterine bleeding or gastrointestinal-related causes of anemia, and lowest among those with other causes; this proportion was also significantly greater among responders than nonresponders. A ≥ 1.0-g/dL increase in hemoglobin on day 14 most accurately predicted satisfactory overall hemoglobin response to oral iron on day 42/56 (sensitivity 90.1%; specificity 79.3%; positive and negative predictive values of 92.9% and 72.7%, respectively). Iron-replacement therapy improved quality of life and reduced fatigue.

- **Conclusion**: Hemoglobin responses < 1.0

### Assessment of haemoglobin and serum markers of iron deficiency in people with cardiovascular disease [^114RFgwc]. Heart (2023). Low credibility.

This analysis also throws further doubt on the utility of serum ferritin for diagnosing iron deficiency in patients with cardiovascular disease. Most patients had values of 30 µg/L, and low values of ferritin were associated with a good prognosis. Serum iron and TSAT were less often measured but were usually low in patients with moderate or severe anaemia, and also often low even when haemoglobin was normal. However, unlike serum ferritin, a low serum iron and TSAT were associated with a worse prognosis. Ultimately, bone marrow histology for iron deposits and the clinical response to correction of iron deficiency are the most reliable ways of defining which test should be used to identify iron deficiency.

Iron deficiency — due to medications predisposing to bleeding (antiplatelets) and/or malabsorption of iron (PPIs), reduced dietary intake, or the failure to use appropriate body iron stores (e.g. due to inflammation) — is a common cause of anaemia in patients with cardiovascular disease. In patients with heart failure, iron deficiency with or without anaemia is associated with worse symptoms, quality of life, and greater mortality. Regular testing of iron indices in all patients with heart failure, regardless of their haemoglobin concentration, is suggested by European guidelines. However, in our cohort, testing for iron deficiency was driven primarily by the severity of anaemia. In contemporary data for patients with heart failure, the rate of testing of iron indices may be as low as 1%–2%.

### Diagnosis and management of hemochromatosis: 2011 practice guideline by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^116VTxiw]. Hepatology (2011). Low credibility.

The clinical diagnosis of hemochromatosis is based on documentation of increased iron stores, demonstrated by elevated serum ferritin levels, which reflects an increase in hepatic iron content. Hemochromatosis can be further defined genotypically by the familial occurrence of iron overload associated with C282Y homozygosity or C282Y/H63D compound heterozygosity. Serologic iron markers, such as transferrin saturation (TS) and ferritin, are widely available, and the majority of patients with hemochromatosis are now identified while still asymptomatic and without evidence of hepatic fibrosis or cirrhosis.

Certain high-risk groups should be targeted for evaluation, such as those with a family history of hemochromatosis, suspected organ involvement, or incidental findings of biochemical and/or radiological abnormalities suggestive of iron overload. It is generally recommended that all patients with abnormal liver function undergo iron studies at some point in their evaluation. The algorithm outlined in Fig. 3 provides additional direction regarding testing and is modified from the version used in previous AASLD guidelines.

- **Algorithm Description**: An algorithm provides further guidance regarding testing and treatment for hemochromatosis. This algorithm is modified from the version used in the previous AASLD guidelines.

The initial approach to diagnosis is through indirect markers of iron stores, namely transferrin saturation or unsaturated iron-binding capacity and serum ferritin. Transferrin saturation is calculated from the ratio of serum iron to total iron-binding capacity.

Our results demonstrate that hemoglobin and MCV are insensitive predictors of iron deficiency in the first trimester and throughout pregnancy. Based on the testing characteristics observed in our cohort, if we screen for first-trimester iron deficiency using microcytosis or anemia, 59 of 100 patients with iron deficiency will go undetected. This screening failure becomes even more concerning as pregnancy progresses and iron deficiency becomes more prevalent.

Given the retrospective study design, iron deficiency could be accurately determined only for the patients with ferritin results in our health care system, meaning that the true prevalence across our population might be obscured by selection bias. However, because sensitivity is an intrinsic test characteristic unaffected by prevalence, our primary hypothesis that hemoglobin and MCV are poor screening tools to detect iron deficiency in pregnancy should remain relatively unaffected by this selection bias.

The 2021 American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists' practice guidance document for anemia in pregnancy recommends a first-trimester screening CBC but does not recommend evaluating iron status (ferritin) directly in the absence of anemia or microcytosis. However, our study demonstrates that hemoglobin (anemia) and MCV (microcytosis) are poor predictors of iron deficiency throughout pregnancy. Therefore, our institution's iron deficiency screening policy for pregnant women now aligns with the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics recommendations.

### British society of gastroenterology guidelines for the management of iron deficiency anaemia in adults [^1172SQqC]. Gut (2021). Low credibility.

The introduction of faecal immunochemical testing (FIT) for trace quantities of blood in the stool has provided a major step forward in risk stratification for those presenting with clinical features that are potentially due to colorectal cancer (CRC). The value of FIT has been demonstrated in a series of large observational studies. FIT is currently recommended by NICE for determining whether IDA in the under-60 age group warrants fast-track referral. While this suggestion is logical, the evidence base is limited.

The place of FIT in risk stratification for the IDA population as a whole — either as a stand-alone test or in conjunction with established tools — remains to be established. There are reasons for caution about a FIT-based triage system for IDA. First, CRC accounts for only a minority of the pathology found on the investigation of IDA, particularly in those under 60. Second, data from six recently published studies of real-world experience confirm that even at the low detection threshold of 10 µg/g, the sensitivity of FIT for CRC ranges from 83% to 91%.

Furthermore, although numbers are small, there is a suspicion that IDA may be over-represented in the FIT-negative CRC subgroup, accounting for 32 (40%) of the 81 pooled cases. This conclusion is supported by a meta-analysis of the few IDA-specific studies in the published literature, which yielded a sensitivity of 83% of FIT for CRC, with concerns that this may be an over-estimate due to publication bias.

### Establishing pediatric and adult RBC reference intervals with NHANES data using piecewise regression [^113RW7HY]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2019). Low credibility.

RBC laboratory values are among the most important clinical laboratory tests used by health care providers for diagnosing diseases, monitoring various medical conditions, and assessing nutritional status. Anemia, which is diagnosed with data from the CBC, is a global health problem affecting about 25% of the population worldwide, with the highest prevalence among preschool-aged children and pregnant women. In a survey of female US Army personnel, the prevalence of iron deficiency anemia immediately following basic combat training has been reported to be about 21%, with higher prevalence among Hispanic and African-American military personnel than among white military personnel. Anemia is typically identified by the presence of low hemoglobin levels; however, other CBC measures, in particular RBC parameters, are surrogate measures of iron availability and are essential for optimal classification, monitoring, and management of anemia. Measures collected as part of the CBC parameters are also used as a screening tool for a wide range of conditions and diseases, including infection, inflammation, neoplasia, and systemic disease, and are also markers for specific types of leukemia.

RBC reference intervals determine the upper and lower limits for normal test results and are typically defined as 95% (± 2.5% upper and lower limits) of the measured values from a healthy population. They provide baseline values that are used to interpret clinical laboratory test results and for diagnosis and disease management. RBC parameters vary with demographic factors such as age, sex, race/ethnicity, and…

### Characterization of iron status biomarkers and hematological indices among young adults of East Asian or Northern European ancestry: A cross-sectional analysis from the Iron Genes in East Asian and Northern European Adults Study (FeGenes) [^112boi6U]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2025). High credibility.

Excess body iron (Fe) accrual is linked to chronic diseases. East Asian (EA) adults, with a median age of 50 years, were reported to have higher Fe stores compared to other populations despite lacking the mutation that causes Fe overload in Northern European (NE) adults. It is unknown if these differences are evident in a healthy population under 50 years of age.

This cross-sectional study aims to compare Fe-related markers in young adults of EA and NE ancestry and identify determinants of Fe status. Participants were healthy United States males and premenopausal/nonpregnant females of genetically confirmed EA (n = 251) or NE (n = 253) ancestry, aged 18–50 years and without obesity. A complete blood count was obtained. Serum ferritin (SF; μg/L), C-reactive protein, and interleukin-6 were measured by immunoassay. Serum soluble transferrin receptor (mg/L) and transferrin were measured by quantitative immunoturbidimetry. Total body Fe (mg/kg) was calculated. Elevated Fe stores were defined as SF > 200 (females) or > 300 (males) and C-reactive protein < 5 mg/L. Results are shown as the geometric mean 95% confidence interval (CI) or mean ± standard deviation.

The mean age of the population was 26.3 years (95% CI: 25.6, 26.9 years), with 69.2% of participants aged under 30 years. SF was higher in EA males (172; 95% CI: 152, 194) compared with NE males (85.3; 95% CI: 76.8, 94.8) (P < 0.001), and in EA females (42.6; 95% CI: 36.7, 49.5) compared with NE females (31.9; 95% CI: 27.8, 36.5) (P = 0.004). The prevalence of elevated Fe stores was 16.7% in EA males compared with 0.8% in NE males (P < 0.001) and 1.6% in EA females compared with 0% in NE females.

### Iron deficiency in heart failure: A scientific statement from the Heart Failure Society of America [^116VQgab]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2023). High credibility.

Iron deficiency is present in approximately 50% of patients with symptomatic heart failure and is independently associated with worse functional capacity, lower quality of life, and increased mortality. The purpose of this document is to summarize knowledge of how iron deficiency is defined in heart failure, as well as its epidemiology and pathophysiology. It also covers pharmacological considerations for repletion strategies. This document further summarizes the rapidly expanding array of clinical trial evidence informing when, how, and in whom to consider iron repletion.

### Interpretation of ferritin concentrations in the dermatology clinic [^116Gd8nd]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2025). Low credibility.

Ferritin measurement is a common laboratory test in dermatology. Ferritin serves as a marker of iron storage in the human body but can also be elevated in inflammatory states. Therefore, changes in ferritin are nonspecific. Correlation of specific clinical findings and risk factors with ferritin concentration and other biomarkers, such as iron studies or C-reactive protein tests, is recommended. This article discusses iron metabolism, the indications for ferritin measurement in dermatology, and how to interpret the laboratory results.

### Iron deficiency resolution and time to resolution in an American health system [^11589t2f]. Blood Advances (2024). Low credibility.

Iron deficiency (ID) is a global health problem with consequences independent of anemia, including impaired cognition and exercise tolerance. The time from laboratory diagnosis to resolution of ID has not been defined. In a retrospective review of electronic medical record data from a Minnesota statewide health system, we identified patients with ID (ferritin level ≤ 25 ng/mL). Patients with at least one follow-up ferritin level within 3 years were included. Patients with a subsequent ferritin of ≥ 50 ng/mL were classified as having resolved ID. Descriptive statistics and time-to-event analyses were used to determine the proportion of ID resolution and time to resolution, and to evaluate characteristics predictive of resolution.

We identified 13,084 patients with ID between 2010 to 2020. We found that 5,485 (41.9%) had resolution within 3 years of diagnosis, whereas 7,599 (58.1%) had no documented resolution. The median time to resolution was 1.9 years (interquartile range, 0.8–3.9). Factors associated with a greater likelihood of resolution included age of ≥ 60 years (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 1.56; 95% confidence interval, 1.44–1.69), male sex (aHR, 1.58; 95% CI, 1.48–1.70), and treatment with intravenous iron (aHR, 2.96; 95% CI, 2.66–3.30). Black race was associated with a lower likelihood of resolution (aHR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.66–0.80). We observed a high proportion of persistent ID and prolonged time to resolution overall, with a greater risk of lack of resolution among females and Black individuals. Targeted knowledge translation interventions are required to facilitate improvement.

### Data-driven physiologic thresholds for iron deficiency associated with hematologic decline [^111vFXg5]. American Journal of Hematology (2020). Low credibility.

Iron deficiency contributes to approximately 50% of anemia prevalence worldwide, but reference intervals for iron status tests are not optimized for anemia diagnosis. To address this limitation, we identified the serum ferritin (SF) thresholds associated with hematologic decline in iron-deficient patients, and the SF thresholds from which an SF increase was associated with hematologic improvement.

Paired red blood cell and SF measurements were analyzed from two adult cohorts at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), from 2008–2011 (N = 48,409), and 2016–2018 (N = 10,042). Inter-patient measurements in the first cohort were used to define optimal SF thresholds based on the physiologic relationship between SF and red cell measurements. Intra-patient measurements (1–26 weeks apart) in the second cohort were used to identify SF thresholds from which an SF increase was associated with an increase in red cell measurements.

The identified optimal SF thresholds varied with age, sex, and red cell measure. Thresholds associated with a ∼5% decline in red cell index were typically in the range of 10–25 ng/mL. Thresholds for younger women (18–45 years old) were approximately 5 ng/mL lower than for older women (60–95 years old), and approximately 10 ng/mL lower than for men. Thresholds from which a subsequent increase in SF was associated with a concomitant increase in red cell measure showed similar patterns: younger women had lower thresholds (∼15 ng/mL) than older women (∼25 ng/mL), or men (∼35 ng/mL).

These results suggest that diagnostic accuracy may be improved by setting different SF thresholds for younger women, older women, and men.

### British Society of Gastroenterology guidelines for the management of iron deficiency anaemia in adults [^1149wkcb]. Gut (2021). Low credibility.

- **Definitions**: We recommend that anaemia is defined as a haemoglobin (Hb) concentration below the lower limit of normal for the relevant population and laboratory performing the test (evidence quality — medium, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong). We recommend that iron deficiency should be confirmed by iron studies prior to investigation. Serum ferritin is the single most useful marker of IDA, but other blood tests (e.g. transferrin saturation) can be helpful if a false-normal ferritin is suspected (evidence quality — medium, consensus — 92%, statement strength — strong). We recommend that a good response to iron therapy (Hb rise ≥ 10 g/L within a 2-week timeframe) in anaemic patients is highly suggestive of absolute iron deficiency, even if the results of iron studies are equivocal (evidence quality — medium, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong).

- **Anaemia**: The WHO defines anaemia as a haemoglobin (Hb) concentration below 130 g/L in men over 15 years of age, below 120 g/L in non-pregnant women over 15 years of age, and below 110 g/L in pregnant women in the second and third trimester. The diagnostic criteria for anaemia in IDA vary between published studies. The normal range for Hb also varies between different populations in the UK. It is reasonable to use the lower limit of the normal range for the laboratory performing the test to define anaemia, but these should be aligned with the WHO-defined lower limits.

There is little consensus as to the level of anaemia that requires investigation. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) referral guidelines indicate that further clarification is needed.

### Brain iron concentration in childhood ADHD: A systematic review of neuroimaging studies [^116gdKKr]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2024). Low credibility.

Iron deficiency may play a role in the pathophysiology of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Due to its preponderant function in monoamine catecholamine and myelin synthesis, brain iron concentration may be of primary interest in the investigation of iron dysregulation in ADHD. This study reviewed evidence of brain iron abnormalities in children and adolescents with ADHD using magnetic resonance imaging methods, such as relaxometry and quantitative susceptibility mapping, to assess brain iron estimates. The study was conducted following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. A literature search was performed for studies published between January 1, 2008, and July 7, 2023, in Medline, Scopus, and ProQuest. Regions of interest, brain iron index values, and phenotypical information were extracted from the relevant studies. Risk of bias was assessed using a modified version of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute quality assessment tool.

Seven cross-sectional studies comparing brain iron estimates in children with ADHD with neurotypical children were included. Significantly reduced brain iron content in medication-naïve children with ADHD was a consistent finding. Two studies found psychostimulant use may increase and normalize brain iron concentration in children with ADHD. The findings were consistent across the studies despite differing methodologies and may lay the early foundation for the recognition of a potential biomarker in ADHD.

### The duration of iron deficiency burden [^116Rtd3G]. Blood Advances (2024). Low credibility.

We read with interest the article by Cogan et al, in which they report that 58% of adults with iron deficiency (ferritin < 50 μg/L) recovered within 3 years. We present similar data from a retrospective observational analysis of a longitudinal female cohort in Western Australia.

Data were obtained longitudinally from generation 2 of the Raine Study from 2007 until 2019. Of 268 women, the mean ferritin at age 17 years was 36.5 ± 28.1 μg/L, with 49% being iron deficient (ferritin < 30 μg/L), of which 92% were non-anemic. By age 20 years, the mean ferritin was 43.4 ± 33.9 μg/L, and 40% were iron deficient. At age 22 years, the mean ferritin was 44.2 ± 30.7 μg/L, with 38% being iron deficient. By age 27 years, the mean ferritin was 57.2 ± 50.9 μg/L, and 31% of women were iron deficient.

- **Longitudinal changes in iron status**: Data are reported as the number of iron-deficient data sets (ferritin < 30 μg/L) and non–iron-deficient data sets (ferritin ≥ 30 μg/L) at ages 17, 20, 22, and 27 years.

Of the 108 women with iron deficiency at age 17 years, 84 (78%) remained iron deficient by age 20 years, 58 women (53%) remained iron deficient until age 22 years, and 35 women (32%) remained iron deficient through age 27 years. New cases of iron deficiency developed between the ages of 17 and 20 years in 24 of 138 women (17%), between the ages of 20 and 22 years in 33 of 160 women (21%), and between the ages of 22 and 27 years in 36 of 166 women (22%).

Iron deficiency appeared more common during this period.

### Physiologically based serum ferritin thresholds for iron deficiency among women and children from Africa, Asia, Europe, and Central America: A multinational comparative study [^111tZ19f]. The Lancet Global Health (2025). High credibility.

Diagnosis of iron deficiency commonly relies on the measurement of serum ferritin concentrations. WHO guidelines identify serum ferritin thresholds for iron deficiency among healthy individuals as less than 15 μg/L for women and less than 12 μg/L for children under 5 years, based on expert opinion. We report thresholds for iron deficiency for apparently healthy non-pregnant women and young children based on physiological indicators.

- **Methods**: We performed secondary analyses of cross-sectional data from women (aged 15–49 years) and children (aged 6–59 months) from 12 countries in Africa, Asia, Europe, and Central America from available surveys (2007–19). Using haemoglobin and soluble transferrin receptor concentrations as individual-level indicators of iron deficiency, we identified country-specific serum ferritin thresholds. We conducted a multivariate meta-analysis using individual participant data to assess multinational heterogeneity and intercountry consistency.

- **Findings**: Data were collected from July 2007 to March 2019. A total of 18,251 individuals (13,864 women and 4,387 children) were included in the final analysis. The thresholds of pooled serum ferritin levels corresponding to the starting point of decline in circulating haemoglobin concentrations were 24.8 μg/L (95% CI 24.4–25.2) for women and 22.1 μg/L (20.8–23.4) for children, based on national survey data from 12 countries. The thresholds were consistent among countries (p heterogeneity: women = 0.73, children = 0.43), but median serum ferritin concentrations and lower 5% reference ranges differed. In all countries,…

### Iron deficiency in young basketball players: Is a 100 μg/L ferritin cut-off appropriate for iron supplementation? Results of a randomized placebo-controlled study [^112GzfnW]. Clinical Cardiology (2023). High credibility.

In our study, after the 3-month supplementation, the ferritin level was significantly higher in the iron group than in the placebo group, but only a small portion of the athletes (15%) reached our expected ferritin level. Several studies assessed the effect of oral iron supplementation on iron status laboratory parameters in athletes with iron deficiency without anemia (IDNA). A meta-analysis by DellaValle et al. concluded that 6–8 weeks of at least 100 mg of iron-sulfate supplementation improves the level of ferritin or prevents the further decline of ferritin level in female athletes.

In a study, Villanueva et al. assessed the effect of oral iron supplementation on laboratory parameters in elite soccer players, where they also found a significant increase in ferritin levels after 3 weeks of supplementation. Parallel to our results, Kang et al. did not find a blood count increase in IDNA athletes after iron supplementation. According to these results, iron supplementation in IDNA athletes only refills the iron storages without any change in blood count parameters. This may have an indirect impact on oxygen transport by modifying iron-dependent oxidative enzymes and respiratory proteins. We found a statistically significant increase in blood iron concentration in the placebo group; however, we did not consider that clinically relevant, since blood iron levels can be influenced by a number of other factors such as diurnal variation, fasting status, and inflammatory status.

A study examined the role of the serum iron level in the diagnosis of children (< 18 years) with iron deficiency. They concluded that the serum iron level…
