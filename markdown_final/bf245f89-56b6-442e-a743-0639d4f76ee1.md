## Question

5-HT1D Agonists/Ergot Alkaloids

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about how 5-HT1B/1D agonists (triptans) and ergot alkaloids compare and are used in acute migraine management, including mechanisms, efficacy, safety, interactions, medication overuse, special populations, and a practical prescribing algorithm. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining the drug classes and clarifying mechanisms of action. Then, I should verify efficacy benchmarks and guideline placement. Next, I will review dosing and routes, followed by contraindications, adverse effects, and drug interactions. After that, I need to check medication-overuse headache and withdrawal features. Then, I will examine special populations and non-responders. Finally, I will integrate a pragmatic algorithm and conclude with the synthesis.

> Let me first confirm the class definitions and mechanisms to avoid starting on the wrong foot; I initially thought of triptans as "5-HT1D agonists", but wait, let me verify because clinically they are actually selective 5-HT1B/1D receptor agonists with vasoconstrictive effects via 5-HT1B and inhibition of trigeminal neuropeptide release via 5-HT1D, while ergots are older, nonselective serotonin agonists with broader receptor activity and more toxicity, and modern guidance positions triptans as the migraine-specific first line for moderate to severe attacks over ergots due to superior safety and selectivity, with mechanistic discussion also recognizing neuronal actions that reduce CGRP release even if central penetration remains debated [^115Dr7dq] [^112vgDXz] [^116nZrRd] [^117Eu8tw].

> Next, I should review efficacy benchmarks and make sure the numbers I recall are accurate; meta-analyses consistently show for sumatriptan 100 mg about 59% 2-hour headache response, 29% 2-hour pain freedom, and around 20% sustained pain freedom 2–24 hours, with some later-generation triptans like rizatriptan or eletriptan showing somewhat higher efficacy, and guideline placement from AAFP 2025, SIGN 2023, and DoD/VA 2024 affirms triptans as first-line for acute moderate to severe migraine, with improved outcomes when treatment is initiated early in the attack rather than waiting for moderate pain, consistent with contemporary clinical practice though trials often required moderate baseline pain [^115BHXVj] [^117Ct6vS] [^113xNmhU] [^117Eu8tw] [^114WUWtw] [^117YUryu] [^1146wGQs].

> Hold on, I should verify combination therapy claims; high-credibility evidence indicates that adding an NSAID to a triptan, as in fixed-dose sumatriptan–naproxen, increases 2-hour and sustained pain relief up to 48 hours versus NSAID alone, and regulatory labeling reflects this indication, so for patients with insufficient response to a triptan alone, adding naproxen is reasonable if NSAID risk is acceptable [^114SRMu8] [^115ySprq].

> I need to check practical dosing and routes so I don't miss key formulation nuances; oral sumatriptan is dosed 25–100 mg with a maximum of 200 mg/day, and route selection matters: intranasal zolmitriptan or intranasal sumatriptan and subcutaneous sumatriptan are valuable when nausea/vomiting or rapid escalation occurs, with Cochrane reviews supporting intranasal and regulatory guidance endorsing non-oral routes for early vomiting or severe attacks [^112Vdh5Y] [^117QA8zH] [^116rXaZ8] [^11296RJh].

> Now, I will examine safety and cardiovascular contraindications because this is where harm can occur if I am not careful; absolute contraindications to triptans include coronary artery disease, coronary vasospasm (e.g. Prinzmetal), history of MI or stroke/TIA, peripheral vascular disease, and uncontrolled hypertension, reflecting 5-HT1B–mediated vasoconstriction, and labeling also restricts use with MAO inhibitors within 14 days and within 24 hours of another triptan or an ergot due to additive vasospasm risk [^111f2qc7] [^113X1j23] [^112vgDXz].

> Wait, I should confirm the serotonin syndrome risk to avoid overstating it; labels caution about serotonin syndrome when combined with SSRIs, SNRIs, TCAs, or MAOIs, and although the absolute risk is low, clinicians must counsel patients on symptom recognition and avoid MAOIs within 14 days with sumatriptan or sumatriptan–naproxen per FDA labeling [^111f2qc7] [^113X1j23].

> I need to ensure I'm precise about medication overuse headache; overuse of triptans or ergots on 10 or more days per month may lead to MOH and labels recommend headache diaries, with prospective data showing that withdrawal headaches are shorter and less severe after triptan overuse than after ergot or analgesic overuse, which is clinically useful when planning detoxification and setting expectations [^111YGbJd] [^111f2qc7] [^112kNSdU].

> Hold on, I should verify a potential mistake I almost made; I started to call the MOH statement a boxed warning, but that's not correct for triptans — MOH is a labeled warning/precaution rather than a boxed warning on FDA labeling, so I should correct that and keep the counseling emphasis without mislabeling the regulatory status [^111f2qc7] [^111YGbJd].

> Next, I should review drug–drug interactions beyond serotonergic combinations; a strict 24-hour separation is required between triptans and ergots and between two triptans, MAOIs are contraindicated within 14 days for sumatriptan-containing regimens, and when using fixed-dose sumatriptan–naproxen, standard NSAID warnings apply, including avoidance in patients with aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease and caution in those with GI bleed risk, renal impairment, and certain cardiovascular risks [^111f2qc7] [^113X1j23] [^115ySprq].

> Let me think about special populations and clinical scenarios to ensure nuance; in pregnancy, SIGN 2023 allows consideration of sumatriptan in all trimesters after risk–benefit discussion, and for adolescents, FDA labeling permits triptans such as almotriptan and rizatriptan in ages 12–17, and fixed-dose sumatriptan–naproxen is labeled for patients 12 years and older, while in severe attacks with early vomiting, non-oral routes are advisable, and for cluster headache, inhaled oxygen remains first line with evidence supporting subcutaneous sumatriptan or intranasal triptans rather than oral forms due to onset limitations [^111r7sWg] [^115ciyKz] [^115M69PK] [^115ySprq] [^11296RJh] [^116Nb9dE].

> I should double-check guidance on nonresponders before recommending a switch; do not abandon the class after a single failure since response varies by agent and pharmacokinetics, and consensus methods recommend trying at least two different oral triptans before switching classes, while for patients with contraindications, intolerance, or inadequate response to more than one oral triptan, lasmiditan (a 5-HT1F agonist without vasoconstriction) is a reasonable option but requires an 8-hour driving restriction, and adding naproxen to a triptan is also evidence-based for suboptimal response [^112rjqME] [^113b9LKr] [^1145YhJg] [^111YGbJd] [^112brsaB] [^115ySprq].

> But wait, what about the role of ergots in current practice; modern guidelines and reviews advise that oral ergot alkaloids are less effective and more toxic and should be avoided as substitutes for triptans, reserving parenteral dihydroergotamine for selected refractory cases if used at all, which aligns with the shift in safety profile favoring triptans as first-line migraine-specific agents [^114e7SpV] [^11345J3V].

> I will now examine evidence on early treatment timing and consistency because this affects real-world advice; treating at first recognition of the attack improves outcomes and may prevent central sensitization, which aligns with practice recommendations despite trial designs often enforcing moderate baseline pain, and patient-centered outcomes emphasize pain freedom rather than mere pain reduction, guiding endpoint selections and counseling on early dosing [^1146wGQs] [^117YUryu] [^116cNEue].

> Let me verify cost and utilization considerations cautiously, acknowledging evidence quality; older cost analyses suggested complex tradeoffs with ergots, but contemporary practice emphasizes avoiding opioids and optimizing triptan selection due to higher downstream costs and morbidity in insufficient responders, and internal medicine guidance supports escalation by adding a triptan when acetaminophen alone is inadequate in nonpregnant adults, reinforcing appropriate early use of migraine-specific therapy while minimizing low-value opioid exposure [^111MQskN] [^111QwJqE] [^113j4mzn].

> Next, I should review patient counseling and monitoring to ensure safety is operationalized; counsel on MOH limits to nine or fewer days per month with use of a headache diary, the 24-hour prohibition on combining triptans with ergots or other triptans, recognition of serotonin syndrome, blood pressure checks in those with risk, pregnancy and lactation notification, and for lasmiditan, strict avoidance of driving for at least eight hours after dosing, with reconsideration of diagnosis if no benefit from the first treated attack per FDA guidance [^111f2qc7] [^111YGbJd] [^115Dr7dq].

> Finally, let me synthesize the practical algorithm so I do not miss a step; confirm the migraine diagnosis, screen for vascular disease and MAOI use, start with NSAIDs or acetaminophen for mild attacks and a triptan for moderate to severe attacks taken early, choose non-oral routes if early vomiting or rapid escalation is present, add naproxen if response is incomplete and NSAID use is safe, try at least two different triptans before switching, and if failures or contraindications persist, use lasmiditan with driving precautions and consider prevention if acute therapy is needed more than two days per week, consistent with AAFP 2025, SIGN 2023, and DoD/VA 2024 recommendations [^113xNmhU] [^117Eu8tw] [^114WUWtw] [^112brsaB] [^1145YhJg].

> Clinical synthesis: triptans, as selective 5-HT1B/1D agonists, are the cornerstone for acute moderate to severe migraine with robust efficacy, flexible formulations, and a manageable safety profile when cardiovascular screening and interaction checks are performed, while ergots are largely historical due to inferior tolerability and safety, and optimization hinges on early dosing, combination with NSAIDs when appropriate, avoiding overuse, and structured fallback to non-vasoconstrictive agents like lasmiditan for contraindications or multi-triptan failure, an approach supported across contemporary guidelines and FDA labeling [^113xNmhU] [^117Eu8tw] [^114WUWtw] [^111f2qc7] [^111YGbJd].

---

5-HT1D agonists (triptans) are first-line for acute migraine [^113xNmhU] because of their **high efficacy** [^115BHXVj] and **rapid onset** [^115BnA7o], but are contraindicated in patients with cardiovascular disease due to vasoconstriction risk [^112vgDXz] [^111f2qc7]. Ergot alkaloids are considered second-line because of **lower efficacy** and **higher toxicity**, including ergotism and medication overuse headache [^114e7SpV] [^11345J3V] [^111YGbJd]. Triptans are preferred for most patients, with ergot alkaloids reserved for refractory cases without vascular risk; both require careful monitoring for adverse effects and drug interactions [^114WUWtw] [^111f2qc7].

---

## Mechanism of action

### 5-HT1D agonists (triptans)

- **Receptor targets**: Selective agonists at 5-HT1B/1D receptors on cranial blood vessels and trigeminal nerve endings [^115Dr7dq] [^116nZrRd].
- **Vasoconstriction**: 5-HT1B-mediated constriction of dilated cranial vessels [^112vgDXz].
- **Neuropeptide inhibition**: 5-HT1D-mediated inhibition of CGRP and substance P release, reducing neurogenic inflammation and pain transmission [^116nZrRd] [^117Tfm8q].

---

### Ergot alkaloids

Ergot alkaloids act as **non-selective agonists** at 5-HT1B/1D, alpha-adrenergic, and dopaminergic receptors, producing **vasoconstriction** of cranial and peripheral vessels. They also **reduce the release of CGRP** and other neuropeptides.

---

## Clinical efficacy

### 5-HT1D agonists (triptans)

Triptans are **highly effective** for acute migraine [^113xNmhU], achieving 2-hour pain relief in approximately 60% [^115BHXVj] and pain freedom in about 30% of patients [^117Ct6vS]. They have **rapid onset** — especially with subcutaneous sumatriptan (10–15 minutes) — and provide consistent efficacy across multiple attacks [^115BnA7o] [^117Ct6vS].

---

### Ergot alkaloids

Ergot alkaloids are effective but **less consistent** than triptans, with a **slower onset**, higher recurrence rates, and more variable responses across attacks [^11345J3V] [^114e7SpV].

---

## Safety profiles and adverse effects

### 5-HT1D agonists (triptans)

- **Common adverse effects**: Mild/transient chest tightness, dizziness, paresthesia, fatigue, nausea [^111f2qc7] [^114Y9d5y].
- **Serious adverse effects**: Rare cardiovascular events (myocardial ischemia, arrhythmias, stroke) in predisposed patients [^112vgDXz].
- **Contraindications**: Coronary artery disease, uncontrolled hypertension, severe hepatic impairment, hemiplegic/basilar migraine, pregnancy.

---

### Ergot alkaloids

- **Common adverse effects**: Nausea, vomiting, muscle cramps, paresthesia, dizziness [^11345J3V].
- **Serious adverse effects**: Ergotism (severe vasoconstriction, ischemia, gangrene), medication overuse headache, fibrosis.
- **Contraindications**: Cardiovascular disease, uncontrolled hypertension, pregnancy, hepatic/renal impairment, concomitant CYP3A4 inhibitors [^11345J3V].

---

## Pharmacokinetics

| **Parameter** | **Triptans** | **Ergot alkaloids** |
|-|-|-|
| Onset of action | Rapid (10–30 min) | Slow (30–60 min) | [^115BnA7o] [^11345J3V]
| Half-life | Short (2–6 h) | Long (12–24 h) | [^116Ur9fB] [^11345J3V]
| Metabolism | Hepatic (CYP450) | Hepatic (CYP3A4) | [^116Ur9fB] [^11345J3V]
| Duration of effect | Short | Prolonged | [^116Ur9fB] [^11345J3V]

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Triptans are recommended as **first-line therapy** for moderate-to-severe acute migraine [^113xNmhU] [^117Eu8tw] [^114WUWtw], while ergot alkaloids are **reserved for refractory cases** or when triptans are contraindicated [^11345J3V] [^114e7SpV]. Combination therapy with sumatriptan–naproxen can **enhance efficacy** in acute migraine [^112brsaB] [^114SRMu8] [^115ySprq].

---

## Patient populations and clinical scenarios

In practice, **Triptans are preferred** for most patients without cardiovascular risk [^112vgDXz] who need rapid onset and a consistent response. Ergot alkaloids are preferred for **refractory cases** or when **triptans are contraindicated**, provided cardiovascular risk is absent [^11345J3V] [^114e7SpV].

---

## Emerging therapies and future directions

Gepants, such as ubrogepant and rimegepant, are **CGRP receptor antagonists** suitable for patients with cardiovascular risk or triptan intolerance [^114e7SpV]. Ditans, exemplified by lasmiditan, are 5-HT1F agonists that **do not cause vasoconstriction** and serve as options for similar patients [^111bsiH9] [^1159eWnh]. Neuromodulation is a non-pharmacological approach under investigation [^113vveFy]. These therapies offer alternatives for patients with cardiovascular risk or triptan intolerance.

### Acute migraine headache: Treatment strategies [^11345J3V]. American Family Physician (2018). Low credibility.

Migraine is a primary headache disorder characterized by recurring attacks. Acetaminophen, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, triptans, antiemetics, ergot alkaloids, and combination analgesics have evidence supporting their effectiveness in the treatment of migraine. Acetaminophen and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are first-line treatments for mild to moderate migraines, whereas triptans are first-line treatments for moderate to severe migraines. Although triptans are effective, they may be expensive.

Other medications, such as dihydroergotamine and antiemetics, are recommended for use as second- or third-line therapy for select patients or for those with refractory migraine. The pharmacologic properties, potential adverse effects, cost, and routes of administration vary widely, allowing therapy to be individualized based on the pattern and severity of attacks. Several treatment principles, including taking medication early in an attack and using a stratified treatment approach, can help ensure that migraine treatment is cost-effective.

### The safety of triptans in the treatment of patients with migraine [^112vgDXz]. The American Journal of Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

The introduction of triptans (5-hydroxytryptophan [5-HT] (1B/1D) agonists) in the past decade has brought migraine-specific pain relief to those suffering from migraine. These drugs activate the serotonin receptors 5-HT(1B) and 5-HT(1D) on cerebral vessels. Concerns about their safety, particularly in patients with vascular risk factors, have been raised because triptans also activate the 5-HT(1B) receptors on coronary arteries. Although triptans are contraindicated in patients with cardiac or cerebrovascular disease, they are safer than many other medications used to treat patients with migraine, including the nonspecific serotonin-agonist ergot preparations.

**Medication overuse headache**: Overuse of acute migraine drugs, such as ergotamines, triptans, opioids, or combinations of these drugs for 10 or more days per month, may lead to the exacerbation of headaches, known as medication overuse headaches. This condition may present as migraine-like daily headaches or a marked increase in the frequency of migraine attacks. Detoxification of patients, including the withdrawal of overused drugs and the treatment of withdrawal symptoms — which often includes a transient worsening of headache — may be necessary.

### Ergot and triptan overuse in Austria — an evaluation of clinical data and cost [^111MQskN]. Cephalalgia (2002). Low credibility.

Austria is one of the countries in which ergots are still the most commonly used acute anti-migraine drugs. Overuse and chronification present a clinical problem for ergots, as well as for the recently developed triptans. In a retrospective study for the year 1999, we evaluated clinical data from all Austrian neurological hospitals, including the cost of withdrawal and the estimated cost for ergots and triptans on the pharmaceutical retail market. We identified a total of 96 patients who underwent withdrawal, all due to ergot overuse, with some experiencing considerable long-term side effects. The cost of withdrawal exceeded 1,300,000, and together with the direct cost of medication, amounted to over 11 million. In contrast, the cost of medication for triptans was 12.8 million for the same year, without any associated cost for withdrawal. If only cost aspects were considered in prescribing acute anti-migraine drugs, our data would suggest choosing ergots rather than triptans. However, since scientific evidence clearly favors triptans, decision making for prescribing clinicians is more complex. It will primarily focus on optimizing patient care, but will also depend on the respective socio-economic situation.

### SIGN 155 pharmacological management of migraine: A national clinical guideline [^1156ZP8S]. SIGN (2023). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for migraine, particularly in patients with menstrual migraines, the SIGN 2023 guidelines recommend counseling these patients. For those using triptans at other times of the month, additional perimenstrual prophylaxis is advised to be cautious as it increases the risk of developing medication-overuse headaches.

---

### Evaluating the triptans [^116Ur9fB]. The American Journal of Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

The debilitating effect of migraine has fueled the search for more specific agents to treat its characteristic and associated symptoms. Second-generation oral triptans have shown an improved efficacy profile in comparison with the pioneer sumatriptan, as well as with the over-the-counter medications and prescription analgesics that have been staples of migraine treatment. Although all triptans exert effects through the 5-hydroxytryptamine 1B/1D receptors, each triptan has distinctive pharmacokinetic properties that determine its efficacy and tolerability profile.

Empirical findings based on clinical trials have led to associations between triptan pharmacology and efficacy. With the expanded treatment choices, the onus is on healthcare providers — especially primary care physicians, who see the majority of patients with migraine — to determine which treatment has an efficacy profile that best suits the individual patient's needs. Patients prefer pharmacotherapy with a rapid onset of action that facilitates complete pain relief and no recurrence. Data from published comparator trials, based on commonly used efficacy endpoints and pharmacokinetic properties underlying patient-preferred outcomes, are reviewed in this article.

### Tosymra [^115Dr7dq]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Tosymra is indicated for the acute treatment of migraine with or without aura in adults. It functions as a serotonin (5-HT1B/1D) receptor agonist, commonly known as a triptan, and is specifically designed for this condition.

- **Limitations of use**: Use Tosymra only if a clear diagnosis of migraine has been established. If there is no response to the first migraine attack treated with Tosymra, reconsider the diagnosis before administering it for any subsequent attacks. It is not indicated for the preventive treatment of migraine, nor is it appropriate for the treatment of cluster headaches.

### Health technology assessment for the acute and preventive treatment of migraine: A position statement of the International Headache Society [^112rjqME]. Cephalalgia (2021). Low credibility.

Patients with prior treatment failure, intolerance to prior treatment, contraindications to treatment, or for whom oral intake is not possible merit special consideration when assessing new technologies intended for the acute treatment of migraine.

- **Prior treatment failure**: New technologies for the acute treatment of migraine can be compared with placebo in patients with a prior history of treatment failure. For health technology assessments (HTAs), it is recommended that treatment failure be defined as an inadequate response at 2 hours post-dose on the endpoints of pain freedom or headache response (reduction of pain intensity from severe or moderate to mild or none) and freedom or response from the most bothersome symptom (MBS) associated with migraine (e.g. nausea, photophobia, or phonophobia) in at least three migraine attacks treated with an adequate dose and at the correct time of intake (not during aura) or stimulation. Treatment failure involving 5-HT1B/1D receptor agonists (triptans) should be defined as an inadequate response on the endpoints listed above to at least two different triptans, alone or in combination with NSAIDs.

- **Intolerance to prior treatment**: New technologies for the acute treatment of migraine can be compared with placebo in patients who have a history of intolerance to prior treatment due to adverse events (AEs). For patients reporting mild intolerance to triptans, a history of poor tolerability to at least two different medications in the class should be documented.

### Predicting the response to a triptan in migraine using deep attack phenotyping: A feasibility study [^1146wGQs]. Cephalalgia (2021). High credibility.

Some of the varying outcomes across studies predicting treatment outcome are likely due to key design differences. First, in some studies, patients had to take their medication when pain was at least moderate in intensity, whereas in the present study, patients were asked to use their medication immediately upon recognizing their headache as a migraine attack. Our advice to treat the attack early may have prevented the complete phenotypic expression of the attack, reducing the frequency of occurrence of some features, such as nausea, photophobia, or allodynia, which were accordingly identified as being lower in our patients than those reported in other studies.

However, the clinical relevance of early — compared to late — predictors of treatment response is crucial since standard clinical advice is to treat when the patient recognizes their attack. Secondly, although previous studies were conducted on larger samples of subjects, these did not minimize factors that may alter the response to treatment, such as the use of preventive medication, the previous use of triptans, or the exclusion of attacks treated at waking. Thirdly, previous studies included patients suffering from both migraine without aura and migraine with aura, since there are reported clinical differences.

Moreover, a recent analysis of data gathered from multiple randomized trials found that the response to sumatriptan, when used acutely in migraine attacks, was less effective in migraine with aura compared to migraine without aura.

Frovatriptan has been explored in a study showing that major depressive disorder frequently co-occurs with migraine, highlighting additional complexities in treatment response.

### Rapid uptake of sumatriptan into the brain: An ongoing question of blood-brain barrier permeability [^116nZrRd]. Cephalalgia (2020). Low credibility.

It is almost 30 years since the prototypical triptan, sumatriptan, was licensed, revolutionizing the treatment of migraine. Developed to activate the serotonin 5-HT 1B and 1D receptors, the precise mechanisms and site of action of the triptans have been a hotly debated topic over the years, from an initial vascular theory to the now widely accepted neuronal theory. Indeed, it is now widely considered that the triptans, including sumatriptan, act to prevent the release of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), specific modulation of which has now emerged as a standalone therapeutic option for migraine and cluster headache. Despite this increased knowledge, the exact site of action of the triptans remains elusive. While generally accepted to be acting peripherally on trigeminal nociceptive afferents, a potential central mechanism continues to be vigorously debated at most headache meetings.

Triptan binding sites have been identified throughout the central nervous system (CNS), including key regions of the hypothalamus and brainstem, while local activation of 5-HT 1B/1D receptors within the thalamus, hypothalamus, periaqueductal gray, and trigeminal nucleus caudalis have all demonstrated anti-nociceptive effects in experimental animal models of trigeminal nociception. Clinically, a relatively poor CNS penetrability of the triptans has been heralded to negate a potential central site of action, supported by a comparative clinical efficacy between sumatriptan and the more lipophilic triptans, which points to limited increased clinical efficacy over relatively peripherally restricted action.

The dosage of sumatriptan succinate PO for the treatment of migraine attacks in adults is as follows:

- **Maintenance**: 25–100 mg PO every 2 hours as needed.
- **Maximum**: 200 mg per day.

### SIGN 155 pharmacological management of migraine: A national clinical guideline [^112brsaB]. SIGN (2023). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for migraine, particularly in managing acute attacks, the SIGN 2023 guidelines recommend considering combination therapy with sumatriptan (50–85 mg) and naproxen (500 mg) for patients experiencing acute migraine.

### Acute treatment patterns in patients with migraine newly initiating a triptan [^113tS48w]. Cephalalgia (2020). Low credibility.

This study has several limitations. It is limited to commercially insured adults with a medical diagnosis of migraine and a prescription for a triptan, representing a subset of the overall migraine population. This is due to significant rates of underdiagnosis and undertreatment documented in previous studies. Our sample is further restricted to patients newly initiating a triptan, defined as no fills for a triptan in the 12 months prior to the index date (41% of all triptan users in our study). It may have included some non-new triptan users who filled a prescription for a triptan less than once per year. Hence, our results are generalizable to the subset of those patients diagnosed with migraine who newly initiated a triptan after at least one year of no evidence of the use of triptans. A medical diagnosis of migraine was captured as any medical claim with an associated ICD-9 code of 346.XX, and as with any analysis using administrative claims data, coding and entry errors may exist.

### Guidelines of the International Headache Society for controlled trials of acute treatment of migraine attacks in adults: Fourth edition [^117YUryu]. Cephalalgia (2019). High credibility.

Additional challenges hindering clinical trials for the acute treatment of aura include the low incidence and relatively short duration of aura, together with the high inter-individual variability of aura characteristics. The adoption of alternative trial designs may help to overcome these challenges and the consequent lack of specific treatments for migraine-associated aura. As a first step, the trial protocol should clearly state if the objective is to abort or reduce the length of the aura or to reduce or eliminate the headache, as these are distinct outcomes that most likely have different neurobiologies. It should also specify that participants have a history of at least one aura or attack of migraine with aura per month.

In trials where the expected effect of treatment is to prevent the headache phase, the primary efficacy endpoint should be the number of headaches following the aura, with pain freedom after 2 hours a secondary efficacy measure. When the focus is on headache prevention in migraine with aura, a feasible compromise can be aura followed by headache in at least 80% of the attacks. In trials where aura is the event of interest, the primary efficacy measure should be the duration of the aura.

- **Early intervention**: To facilitate migraine diagnosis and assess whether acute treatment will be effective when headache intensity is moderate or severe, subjects in clinical trials are often required to wait until headache pain is of at least moderate intensity before they treat an attack. This is not how migraine attacks are treated in clinical practice.

### Axert [^115ciyKz]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2012). Low credibility.

Axert is a 5HT1B/1D receptor agonist (triptan) that is indicated for:

- **Indications and usage**:
	- Acute treatment of migraine attacks in adults with a history of migraine with or without aura.
	- Acute treatment of migraine headache pain in adolescents aged 12 to 17 years with a history of migraine with or without aura and who have migraine attacks usually lasting 4 hours or more.

- **Important limitations**:
	- Use only following a clear diagnosis of migraine has been established.
	- In adolescents aged 12 to 17 years, the efficacy of Axert on migraine-associated symptoms was not established.
	- It is not intended for the prophylactic therapy of migraine.
	- It is not indicated for the treatment of cluster headaches.

- **Acute treatment of migraine attacks**:
	- **Adults**: Axert (almotriptan malate) is indicated for the acute treatment of migraine attacks in patients with a history of migraine with or without aura.
	- **Adolescents aged 12 to 17 years**: Axert is indicated for the acute treatment of migraine headache pain in patients with a history of migraine attacks with or without aura usually lasting 4 hours or more when untreated.

- **Important limitations**: Axert should only be used where a clear diagnosis of migraine has been established. If a patient has no response to the first migraine attack treated with Axert, the diagnosis of migraine should be reconsidered before Axert is administered to treat any subsequent attacks.

In adolescents aged 12 to 17 years, the efficacy of Axert on migraine-associated symptoms (nausea, photophobia, and phonophobia) was not established.

### Almotriptan malate [^115M69PK]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2017). Low credibility.

Almotriptan tablets are a 5HT1B/1D receptor agonist, commonly known as triptans, indicated for the following uses:

- **Indications and usage**: Almotriptan tablets are prescribed for the acute treatment of migraine attacks in adults who have a history of migraine with or without aura. They are also used for treating acute migraine headache pain in adolescents aged 12 to 17 years with a history of migraines that typically last 4 hours or more.

- **Important limitations**:

- Almotriptan tablets should only be used following a clear diagnosis of migraine has been established. If a patient does not respond to the first migraine attack treated with almotriptan, the diagnosis should be reconsidered before using it for any subsequent attacks.
- In adolescents aged 12 to 17 years, the efficacy of almotriptan tablets on migraine-associated symptoms has not been established.
- Almotriptan is not intended for the prophylactic therapy of migraine and is not indicated for treating cluster headaches.

- **Acute treatment of migraine attacks**:

	- **Adults**: Almotriptan tablets (almotriptan malate) are indicated for the acute treatment of migraine attacks in adults with a history of migraine with or without aura.

	- **Adolescents age 12 to 17 years**: Almotriptan tablets are indicated for the acute treatment of migraine headache pain in adolescents with a history of migraine that usually lasts 4 hours or more when untreated.

### Acute treatment patterns in patients with migraine newly initiating a triptan [^115B86Po]. Cephalalgia (2020). Low credibility.

The third outcome was the use of non-triptan acute migraine medications over the 12-month and 24-month post-index periods. Non-index acute migraine medications were listed according to the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) clinical guidelines and grouped into five medication classes: acetaminophen, butalbital combinations, ergots, NSAIDs, and opioids or opioid combinations. Specific doses and strengths were not considered separately.

It should also be noted that the guideline-listed medications under the acetaminophen and NSAID classes (e.g. aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen) are also available over the counter and are unlikely to be completely captured in the prescription claims data. While the guidelines captured all available agents in the medication classes of triptans, ergots, and butalbital combinations (all of which are available as prescription-only drugs), the agents listed under the opioids and opioid combinations in the clinical guidelines are limited to a small subset of all available opioids.

Since patients may have used non-guideline listed opioids, we expanded the measure of opioids to include the use of any available opioid medication. Specifically, individual or combination prescriptions included the following agents:

- **Opioid medications**: buprenorphine (transdermal Butrans® only [Purdue Pharma LP, Stamford, CT]), butorphanol, codeine, dihydrocodeine, fentanyl, hydrocodone, hydromorphone, levorphanol, meperidine, methadone, morphine, nalbuphine, opium alkaloids, oxycodone, oxymorphone, pentazocine, propoxyphene, tapentadol, tramadol

Since opioids may be used for several other indications, we created a measure…

### In acute episodic migraine attacks, triptans, with or without NSAIDs, vs. NSAIDs alone reduce pain at 2 h and up to 48 h [^114SRMu8]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

In the management of acute episodic migraine attacks, the combination of triptans with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) is shown to be more effective at reducing pain at two hours and maintaining pain relief up to 48 hours, compared to the use of NSAIDs alone. This finding is particularly important for clinicians in general internal medicine, family practice, and general practice, as it provides a reliable treatment option for their patients. The relevance of this outcome is also evident in the field of neurology, where effective management of migraine attacks is critical for patient care.

### Acute migraine therapy with external trigeminal neurostimulation (ACME): A randomized controlled trial [^113vveFy]. Cephalalgia (2019). High credibility.

Available acute migraine treatments are mainly pharmacologic therapies (e.g. analgesics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and 'migraine-specific' drugs such as ergots and triptans) that have incomplete efficacy, as well as several side effects and contraindications; their excessive intake may also lead to medication overuse headache and chronification of migraine. These limitations highlight the need for non-pharmacological options for acute migraine treatment.

External trigeminal nerve stimulation (e-TNS) was initially found to produce a sedative effect and subsequently demonstrated safety and efficacy in the prevention of episodic migraine. Tolerability and patient satisfaction with e-TNS for migraine prevention have been confirmed by a prospective study on 2313 patients and in several recent studies. Regarding the use of e-TNS in the acute treatment of migraine, a few small pilot studies and a post-marketing survey in Europe suggested a possible therapeutic effect. Recently, an open-labeled pilot trial showed an average reduction of headache pain severity by 57.1% following a 1-hour e-TNS treatment, with 76.7% of patients reporting ≥ 50% pain relief. Based on these findings, we sought to further evaluate the safety and efficacy of e-TNS for acute pain relief during migraine attacks via the ACME study (Acute treatment of Migraine with External trigeminal nerve stimulation): a randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled trial.

### Triptans (serotonin, 5-HT1B/1D agonists) in migraine: Detailed results and methods of a meta-analysis of 53 trials [^117Ct6vS]. Cephalalgia (2002). Low credibility.

The triptans, selective serotonin 5-HT1B/1D agonists, are very effective acute migraine drugs. Soon, seven different triptans will be clinically available at 13 different oral doses, making evidence-based selection guidelines necessary. Triptan trials have similar designs, facilitating meta-analysis. We wished to provide an evidence-based foundation for using triptans in clinical practice and to review the methodological issues surrounding triptan trials.

We asked pharmaceutical companies and the principal investigators of company-independent trials for the 'raw patient data' of all double-blind, randomized, controlled clinical trials with oral triptans in migraine. All data were cross-checked with published or presented data. We calculated summary estimates across studies for important efficacy and tolerability parameters and compared these with those from direct, head-to-head comparator trials. Out of 76 eligible clinical trials, 53 (12 not yet published) involving 24,089 patients met the criteria for inclusion.

Mean results (and 95% confidence intervals) for sumatriptan 100 mg, the first available and most widely prescribed oral triptan, are as follows: 59% (57–60) for 2-hour headache response (improvement from moderate or severe to mild or no pain); 29% (27–30) for 2-hour pain-free (improvement to no pain); 20% (18–21) for sustained pain-free (pain-free by 2 hours and no headache recurrence or use of rescue medication 2–24 hours post-dose); and 67% (63–70) for consistency (response in at least two out of three treated attacks), with placebo-subtracted proportions for patients with at least one adverse event.

### Acute treatment patterns in patients with migraine newly initiating a triptan [^112jNm7X]. Cephalalgia (2020). Low credibility.

While this study represents a more recent dataset than prior published analyses of treatment patterns in migraine, the index year used for these analyses was 2013 with a 24-month follow-up period. Thus, it is possible that treatment patterns may have changed in more recent years. However, the first triptan was introduced more than 20 years ago and the first generic approximately five years before our study identification period. Therefore, substantial differences in triptan treatment patterns due to changes in triptan approval and availability are unlikely. With the emergent opioid crisis, opioid use may be higher or lower than observed in this sample due to awareness and changes in prescribing patterns.

As is common with administrative claims datasets, information on the reasons why people do not refill their index triptan is not available (e.g. effectiveness, tolerability issues, cost, etc). Given that claims data do not capture information on the severity and frequency of migraine headaches, we are unable to determine if those who discontinue triptans continue to have migraine attacks that require acute treatment. However, the finding that many people who do not refill the index triptan use other migraine-related acute treatments suggests that many of these people do experience migraine headaches that require acute treatment. It should also be noted that the guideline-listed medications under the acetaminophen and NSAID classes (e.g. aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen) are also available over the counter and are unlikely to be captured completely in the prescription claims.

### The influence of genetic constitution on migraine drug responses [^116tTEdp]. Cephalalgia (2016). Low credibility.

The specific acute treatments for migraine are 5HT1B/D receptor agonists, including triptans and ergotamine, but only two-thirds of patients respond well without side effects. Currently, no migraine-prophylactic drugs are specific to migraine, and prophylactic drugs are selected through a time-consuming "trial and error" process. Therefore, personalized treatment is much needed. This study aimed to test the effect of 12 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) significantly associated with migraine on migraine drug responses.

Semi-structured migraine interviews, which included questions on drug responses, blood samples, and genotyping, were conducted on 1806 unrelated migraine cases recruited from the Danish Headache Center. Association analyses were performed using logistic regression, assuming an additive model for the genetic effect. The effect on drug responses was tested for a combined genetic score and for each of the 12 SNPs. Significant findings were subsequently tested in an independent replication sample of 392 unrelated Danish migraine cases.

A single risk variant, rs2651899 in PRDM16, was significantly associated with the efficacy of triptans, with an odds ratio (OR) of treatment success of 1.3. Additionally, a higher combined genetic score was significantly associated with the efficacy of triptans, with an OR of success of up to 2.6. Several SNPs showed nominal preferential association with the efficacy of triptans and others with prophylactic drugs. Analyses of triptans and ergotamine complemented each other and provided a stronger signal when analyzed together.

### Sumatriptan (intranasal route of administration) for acute migraine attacks in adults [^117QA8zH]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). High credibility.

Migraine is a highly disabling condition for the individual, with wide-reaching implications for society, healthcare services, and the economy. Sumatriptan is an abortive medication for migraine attacks, belonging to the triptan family. Intranasal administration may be preferable to oral for individuals experiencing nausea and/or vomiting, although it is primarily absorbed in the gut, not the nasal mucosa.

- **Objectives**: To determine the efficacy and tolerability of intranasal sumatriptan compared to placebo and other active interventions in the treatment of acute migraine attacks in adults.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, online databases, and reference lists for studies through 13 October 2011.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized, double-blind, placebo- and/or active-controlled studies using intranasal sumatriptan to treat a migraine headache episode, with at least 10 participants per treatment arm.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. We used the numbers of participants achieving each outcome to calculate relative risk (or 'risk ratio') and numbers needed to treat to benefit (NNT) or harm (NNH) compared to placebo or a different active treatment.

- **Main results**: Twelve studies (4755 participants) compared intranasal sumatriptan with placebo or an active comparator. Most of the data were for the 10 mg and 20 mg doses. Sumatriptan surpassed placebo for all efficacy outcomes.

Migraine is a highly disabling condition for the individual and has wide-reaching implications for society, healthcare services, and the economy. Sumatriptan is an abortive medication for migraine attacks, belonging to the triptan family.

- **Objectives**: To determine the efficacy and tolerability of oral sumatriptan compared to placebo and other active interventions in the treatment of acute migraine attacks in adults.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, online databases, and reference lists for studies through 13 October 2011.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized, double-blind, placebo- and/or active-controlled studies using oral sumatriptan to treat a migraine headache episode, with at least 10 participants per treatment arm.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. We used numbers of participants achieving each outcome to calculate relative risk (or 'risk ratio') and numbers needed to treat to benefit (NNT) or harm (NNH) compared to placebo or a different active treatment.

- **Main results**: Sixty-one studies (37,250 participants) compared oral sumatriptan with placebo or an active comparator. Most data were for the 50 mg and 100 mg doses. Sumatriptan surpassed placebo for all efficacy outcomes. For sumatriptan 50 mg versus placebo, the NNTs were 6.1, 7.5, and 4.0 for pain-free at two hours and headache relief at one and two hours, respectively.

### Acute treatment patterns in patients with migraine newly initiating a triptan [^1138Xuf8]. Cephalalgia (2020). Low credibility.

The first outcome of interest was the pattern of triptan refills. In the primary analysis, the main measure for this outcome was the number of refills for the index triptan over the 12-month and 24-month post-index periods. In the sensitivity analysis, we loosened the criteria to allow any (index or non-index) triptan fill to be included in the count of the number of triptan refills. Additionally, we examined the number of triptan refills in the subgroup of those who received a quantity of four pills or less with their index triptan prescription.

The second outcome of interest was the use of multiple different triptan agents over the 12-month and 24-month post-index periods. Specifically, we measured the number of different triptan agents filled and the time to initiation of a second (different) triptan agent.

### Triptans for acute cluster headache [^116Nb9dE]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). High credibility.

This updated version of the original Cochrane review, published in Issue 4, 2010 (Law 2010), explores treatment for cluster headache, an uncommon, severely painful, and disabling condition with rapid onset. Validated treatment options are limited. First-line therapy includes inhaled oxygen. Other therapies, such as intranasal lignocaine and ergotamine, are not as commonly used and are less well studied. Triptans are successfully used to treat migraine attacks and may also be useful for cluster headache.

- **Objectives**: To assess the efficacy and tolerability of the triptan class of drugs compared to placebo and other active interventions in the acute treatment of episodic and chronic cluster headache in adult patients.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, ClinicalTrials.gov, and reference lists for studies from inception to January 22, 2010, for the original review, and from 2009 to April 4, 2013, for this update.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies of triptans for acute treatment of cluster headache episodes.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently assessed study quality and extracted data. Numbers of participants with different levels of pain relief, requiring rescue medication, and experiencing adverse events and headache-associated symptoms in treatment and control groups were used to calculate relative risk and numbers needed to treat for benefit (NNT) and harm (NNH).

- **Main results**: New searches in 2013 did not identify any relevant new studies.

### Treximet [^115ySprq]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

TREXIMET is indicated for the acute treatment of migraine, with or without aura, in adults and pediatric patients aged 12 years and older. It is a combination of sumatriptan, a serotonin (5-HT) 1b/1d receptor agonist (triptan), and naproxen sodium, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, used for this purpose.

- **Limitations of use**:
	- Use only if a clear diagnosis of migraine headache has been established. If a patient does not respond to the first migraine attack treated with TREXIMET, reconsider the diagnosis of migraine before administering TREXIMET for any subsequent attacks.
	- TREXIMET is not indicated for the prevention of migraine attacks.
	- Safety and effectiveness of TREXIMET have not been established for cluster headaches.

### Oral triptans (serotonin 5-HT(1B/1D) agonists) in acute migraine treatment: a meta-analysis of 53 trials [^115BHXVj]. Lancet (2001). Low credibility.

The triptans, selective serotonin 5-HT(1B/1D) agonists, are very effective acute migraine drugs with a well-developed scientific rationale. Seven different triptans will soon be clinically available, making evidence-based selection guidelines necessary. Triptan trials have similar designs, facilitating meta-analysis; this will provide a foundation for using triptans in clinical practice.

- **Method**: We asked pharmaceutical companies and the principal investigators of company-independent trials for raw patient data of all double-blind, randomized, controlled clinical trials of oral triptans in migraine. We calculated summary estimates across studies for important efficacy and tolerability parameters and separately summarized direct comparator trials.

- **Results**: Fifty-three clinical trials (12 unpublished) involving 24,089 patients met the criteria for inclusion. Mean results for 100 mg sumatriptan were 59% (95% CI 57–60) for 2-hour headache response (improvement from moderate or severe to mild or no pain); 29% (27–30) for 2-hour pain-free (improvement to no pain); 20% (18–21) for sustained pain-free (pain-free by 2 hours and no headache recurrence or use of rescue medication 2–24 hours post-dose); and 67% (63–70) for consistency (response in at least two of three treated attacks). Placebo-subtracted proportions for patients with at least one adverse event (AE) were 13% (8–18), for at least one central nervous system AE, 6% (3–9), and for at least one chest AE, 1.9% (1.0–2.7). Compared with these data, 10 mg rizatriptan showed better efficacy and consistency, and similar tolerability.

### Millions of migraine attacks, many answers, more questions [^111dm3bZ]. Neurology (2023). High credibility.

In the landscape of migraine treatment, many unanswered questions remain — particularly, which medications are most effective as acute agents and for which patients? Given the heterogeneity of patients, clinicians' practice, and the integration of new agents into migraine care, this is an ambitious question to address. At the same time, this question is crucial both because proper acute treatment is an important metric of quality of care and such treatments are woefully underused in the general population.

### Evidence-based review and frontiers of migraine therapy [^112SteYp]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2025). Low credibility.

- **Serotonin receptor agonists: Lasmiditan**: Historically, triptan medications have been the most frequently utilized migraine-specific treatment available for the acute treatment of migraine. Triptans have also been used in the treatment of cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS). In a prospective study, sumatriptan resulted in a ≥ 50% reduction of vomiting in 54 treated attacks, and a family history of migraine predicted response to treatment. In a cross-sectional survey-based study, the majority of patients reported that sumatriptan use prevented emergency department (ED) visits (64%) and hospitalization (60%).

Triptans are predominantly agonists at the 5-HT 1B/1D serotonin receptors. Agonism at the 1B receptor results in vasoconstriction, while agonism at the 1D receptor is proposed to decrease the release of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and other pro-nociceptive neuropeptides and neurotransmitters. It is thought that the 5-HT 1B vasoconstrictive effect accounts for the cardiovascular and cerebrovascular morbidity associated with triptan use and precludes its use in populations with significant vascular risk factors. Some triptans also have affinity for the 5-HT 1F receptor. Sumatriptan was used in studies to show the presence of the 5-HT 1D and 5-HT 1F receptor subtypes in the human frontal cortex, globus pallidus, periaqueductal gray, and the trigeminal nucleus caudalis. Interestingly, 5-HT 1F may also play a role in mitochondrial biogenesis.

In contrast, the novel migraine acute treatment lasmiditan is a selective 5-HT 1F receptor agonist. Through binding of the presynaptic 5-HT 1F receptor, lasmiditan is proposed to decrease the release of CGRP from the presynaptic terminals.

### Lasmiditan efficacy in the acute treatment of migraine was independent of prior response to triptans: Findings from the CENTURION study [^1159eWnh]. Cephalalgia (2022). High credibility.

A significant proportion of triptan users exhibit an insufficient response or inadequate tolerability to a triptan, and some may develop a contraindication. Lasmiditan, a selective 5-HT1F receptor agonist, may be an option for these individuals. We assessed lasmiditan efficacy in a subgroup of patients in CENTURION (Phase 3 migraine consistency study) who exhibited an insufficient response to triptans, including a subgroup with insufficient response due to efficacy only.

- **Methods**: Patients were randomized to lasmiditan 200 mg for four attacks, lasmiditan 100 mg for four attacks, or placebo for three and lasmiditan 50 mg for one attack. Triptan insufficient responders were pre-defined as patients with insufficient efficacy or tolerability, or who developed a contraindication.

- **Results**: In triptan insufficient responders, lasmiditan was superior to placebo (p < 0.05) for pain freedom beginning at 1 hour (both doses); pain relief beginning at 0.5 hours (200 mg) or 1 hour (100 mg); migraine-related disability freedom; much/very much better on the Patient Global Impression of Change; and most bothersome symptom freedom at 2 hours; sustained pain freedom; and need for rescue medication. Lasmiditan showed benefit for consistency of effect across attacks for 2-hour pain freedom and pain relief. Findings were similar in triptan responders and triptan naïve patients, and when the triptan insufficient response definition was based on efficacy only.

- **Conclusions**: Lasmiditan was efficacious across multiple clinically relevant endpoints in the acute treatment of migraine independent of prior response to triptans.

### Sumatriptan-naproxen sodium in migraine: A review [^114pkNcK]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Low credibility.

For the treatment of a single attack of migraine with moderate to severe pain, sumatriptan-naproxen sodium was first investigated in 2007 against placebo and its individual components: sumatriptan 85 mg and naproxen sodium 500 mg. This was achieved using two replicate, randomized, parallel-group studies.

Participants in these studies predominantly had a diagnosis of migraine without aura (71%–79%), were mostly female (84%–89%), and identified as White (86%–90%). The mean age was 39.4 ± 11.2 and 40.3 ± 11.4 years across the two studies, respectively. Participants had at least a six-month history of migraine with or without aura and experienced 2–6 moderate or severe migraine episodes in the three months preceding the screening visit. Notably, participants were eligible for the studies regardless of whether they were triptan-naïve.

Associated symptoms of migraine reported by participants included photophobia (79%–83%), phonophobia (74%–83%), movement sensitivity (86%–90%), and nausea (41%–56%) across both studies and treatment groups.

### Guidelines of the International Headache Society for controlled trials of acute treatment of migraine attacks in adults: Fourth edition [^1165RaQb]. Cephalalgia (2019). High credibility.

- **Frequency of attacks**: Migraine attacks should occur two to eight times per month. The frequency of other headaches, including non-target headaches, must not exceed one day per month. There should be at least 48 hours of freedom from headaches between migraine attacks under study. Subjects should experience fewer than 15 headache days per month.

	- **Comments**: A minimum of two attacks per month is recommended. The maximum frequency of eight attacks per month reduces the probability that individuals with incipient medication overuse, medication-overuse headache, or chronic migraine will be included in the trial. Allowing 48 hours of headache freedom between migraine attacks permits clear identification of individual attacks and distinction from relapse. It avoids the use of multiple treatments for a single prolonged attack. Evaluating three to five consecutive attacks provides information on consistency of response and may attenuate the placebo effect on the first attack [refer to Section 1.2.12 for more information about consistency of response].

- **Duration of migraine**: Migraine should be present for at least one year prior to inclusion in a clinical trial.

	- **Comments**: Since there are no objective signs or biomarkers for the diagnosis of migraine, the one-year requirement increases the specificity of the diagnostic criteria. A minimum duration of one year is advised to exclude individuals with headache types that may mimic migraine. The history may be based on subject recall or physician input.

### Clinical applications of new therapeutic deliveries in migraine [^115BnA7o]. Neurology (2003). Low credibility.

A number of serotonin (5-HT)1B/1D agonists (triptans) are available worldwide for the treatment of migraine. The first-generation triptan, sumatriptan, was initially launched as an SC injection, which is fast-acting and consistently effective but relatively expensive and can be associated with adverse events in some patients. Sumatriptan was then launched as an oral tablet, shortly followed by the development of second-generation triptans that are now available in several formulations. Tablets are highly effective and convenient but may not be suitable in all migraine situations, e.g. migraine-associated nausea or vomiting and gastric disturbances.

An intranasal route of administration appears to be an obvious way to deliver a migraine treatment, and two triptans — sumatriptan and zolmitriptan — are available in nasal spray formulations. Sumatriptan offered the first nasal spray and has similar efficacy to the sumatriptan tablet, but the response is inconsistent and many patients cannot tolerate the unpleasant taste. The latest nasal spray, zolmitriptan, has produced exciting results in clinical studies and combines a rapid onset of action and consistently high response rates with a good tolerability profile. Early results from the author's clinic suggest that this promise is realized in clinical practice and that this combination of patient benefits makes zolmitriptan nasal spray an ideal way for patients to treat their migraine. With the introduction of zolmitriptan nasal spray, zolmitriptan is now available in three different formulations, enabling patients to tailor their treatment.

### Clinical features of withdrawal headache following overuse of triptans and other headache drugs [^112kNSdU]. Neurology (2001). Low credibility.

Complete withdrawal from headache medication is the treatment of choice for medication-overuse headache. Discontinuation of the overused headache medication, however, results in the development of withdrawal headache, often associated with nausea, vomiting, and sleep disturbances.

- **Method**: In a prospective study of 95 patients, the authors investigated the duration and severity of withdrawal headache after overuse of various headache drugs, including single and combination analgesics, ergots, and triptans. All patients underwent standard inpatient withdrawal therapy for 14 days.

- **Results**: The duration of withdrawal headache was shorter in patients overusing triptans (4.1 days) than in patients overusing ergots (6.7 days) or analgesics (9.5 days; p < 0.002). The mean headache intensity on the first day of withdrawal did not differ between the groups (p = 0.821). By day 14, however, it was lower in patients overusing triptans (0.08) than in patients overusing ergots (0.4) or analgesics (0.9; p < 0.005). Rescue medication was requested less by patients undergoing triptan withdrawal (0.25 requests) than by patients undergoing ergot withdrawal (1.25) or analgesic withdrawal (1.85; p < 0.05).

	- Similar findings were observed in the entire patient population. Withdrawal headache was shorter and less severe in migraineurs overusing triptans than in those overusing ergots or analgesics. Because only patients with migraine, but no patient with tension-type headache, overused triptans, withdrawal headache was shorter in the group of patients with migraine alone (6.7 days versus 9.6 days).

### Sumatriptan (rectal route of administration) for acute migraine attacks in adults [^114eRJXv]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Migraine is a highly disabling condition for individuals and has wide-reaching implications for society, healthcare services, and the economy. Sumatriptan is an abortive medication for migraine attacks, belonging to the triptan family. Rectal administration may be preferable to oral administration for individuals experiencing nausea and/or vomiting.

- **Objectives**: To determine the efficacy and tolerability of rectal sumatriptan compared to placebo and other active interventions in the treatment of acute migraine attacks in adults.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, online databases, and reference lists for studies through 13 October 2011.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized, double-blind, placebo- and/or active-controlled studies using rectally administered sumatriptan to treat a migraine headache episode, with at least 10 participants per treatment arm.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. We used the number of participants achieving each outcome to calculate relative risk (or 'risk ratio') and numbers needed to treat to benefit (NNT) or harm (NNH) compared to placebo or a different active treatment.

- **Main results**: Three studies (866 participants) compared rectally administered sumatriptan with placebo or an active comparator. Most of the data were for the 12.5 mg and 25 mg doses. For the majority of efficacy outcomes, sumatriptan surpassed placebo. For sumatriptan 12.5 mg versus placebo, the NNTs were 5.2 and 3.2 for headache relief.

### Imitrex [^111f2qc7]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Concomitant use with other triptans or ergot medications**: Inform patients that the use of IMITREX tablets within 24 hours of another triptan or an ergot-type medication (including dihydroergotamine or methysergide) is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4), Drug Interactions (7.1, 7.3)].

- **Serotonin syndrome**: Caution patients about the risk of serotonin syndrome with the use of IMITREX tablets or other triptans, particularly during combined use with SSRIs, SNRIs, TCAs, and MAO inhibitors [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7), Drug Interactions (7.4)].

- **Medication overuse headache**: Inform patients that the use of acute migraine drugs for 10 or more days per month may lead to an exacerbation of headaches, and encourage patients to record headache frequency and drug use (e.g. by keeping a headache diary) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)].

- **Pregnancy**: Advise patients to notify their healthcare provider if they become pregnant during treatment or plan to become pregnant [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].

- **Lactation**: Advise patients to notify their healthcare provider if they are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed [see Use in Specific Populations (8.2)].

- **Ability to perform complex tasks**: Treatment with IMITREX tablets may cause somnolence and dizziness; instruct patients to evaluate their ability to perform complex tasks after administration of IMITREX tablets.

### Acute treatment patterns in patients with migraine newly initiating a triptan [^113b9LKr]. Cephalalgia (2020). Low credibility.

Migraine is a chronic neurological disease defined by often incapacitating neurological symptoms, such as headache pain, sensitivity to light and sound, and nausea. It has a significant impact on health-related quality of life, disability, productivity losses, and health care costs. Acute treatments for migraine are taken during an attack with the goals of rapidly treating pain, restoring normal function, and minimizing the use of rescue medications. They are divided into migraine-specific treatments, such as triptans and ergots, and non-specific treatments, such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), non-opioid analgesics, acetaminophen, and caffeinated analgesic combinations. Emerging migraine-specific acute therapies include gepants (ubrogepant and rimegepant) and ditans (lasmiditan).

Triptans, a class of migraine-specific acute treatments, act as selective serotonin receptor (5-HT1b/d) agonists. This class includes almotriptan, eletriptan, frovatriptan, naratriptan, rizatriptan, sumatriptan (oral, nasal spray, injectable), and zolmitriptan (oral and nasal spray). The American Academy of Neurology (AAN) has long recommended triptans as an initial therapy for the acute treatment of moderate or severe migraine attacks. Approximately half of those who receive any prescription acute medications for migraine report using a triptan. Furthermore, the recent American Headache Society (AHS) Consensus Statement recommends the trial of at least two oral triptans before switching to a different medication.

### Guidelines of the International Headache Society for controlled trials of acute treatment of migraine attacks in adults: Fourth edition [^113hLrS6]. Cephalalgia (2019). High credibility.

- **Placebo control**: Recommendations:
	1. Interventions under evaluation for the acute treatment of migraine should be compared with placebo.

	2. When two presumably active treatments are compared, a placebo control should be included for assay sensitivity.

Comments:

The placebo effect is a genuine psychobiological phenomenon that affects the results of clinical trials across different disease states. In trials for the acute treatment of migraine, placebo response varies widely, from 6% to 56% for headache relief and from 6% to 25% for pain freedom. This variability makes it difficult to interpret the results of active comparator trials that do not include placebo. Trials using historical controls or active comparators lack assay sensitivity and require large sample sizes to provide the narrow confidence intervals (CIs) needed to ensure that new drugs are not inferior to controls.

In the past, modified designs (e.g. exclusion of placebo responders or sequential parallel designs) to reduce placebo response have proved poorly effective. Nonetheless, particular care should be dedicated to identifying and mitigating placebo response risks as much as possible.

### What do patients want from acute migraine treatment [^1165nRCC]. Cephalalgia (2004). Low credibility.

Clinical observations have shown that migraine is a progressive disorder, both within an acute attack and within the disease itself. Rates of diagnosis for migraine have increased in the last decade, but more than half of migraineurs remain undiagnosed. Patient expectations of migraine therapies have also increased. Patients require rapid and sustained pain relief with a treatment that has good tolerability and can differ greatly from those of physicians. Management decisions should be made with these expectations in mind to enhance patient outcomes and compliance with treatment. Improved understanding of acute migraine attack pathophysiology has led to the strategy of early treatment to modify both the progression of the attack and, potentially, the progression of the disease itself in the individual. The triptans are effective acute migraine therapies; each agent has its own distinct profile of efficacy and tolerability, enabling individualization of treatment.

### SIGN 155 pharmacological management of migraine: A national clinical guideline [^117Eu8tw]. SIGN (2023). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of migraine, particularly with respect to the management of acute attacks, the SIGN 2023 guidelines recommend offering triptans (sumatriptan 50–100 mg, or other triptans if sumatriptan fails) as first-line therapy in patients experiencing acute migraine.

### Phase 3 randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study of lasmiditan for acute treatment of migraine [^111bsiH9]. Brain (2019). High credibility.

Eligible patients were instructed to treat their next migraine attack within 4 hours of onset, provided their headache was moderate or severe and not improving. Triptans, ergots, opioids, and barbiturates were disallowed within 24 hours of study drug administration. Prior to taking their first dose of the study drug, the patient recorded the time of onset, the severity of the pain, the presence or absence of nausea, phonophobia, photophobia, and which symptom was most bothersome, as well as the presence or absence of vomiting in an electronic diary.

Patients documented their response to the first dose in an electronic diary for 48 hours after intake of the study drug and up to 72 hours if a second dose was taken.

- **Headache severity assessment**: After dosing, patients evaluated headache severity at specified times: 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 24, and 48 hours post-dose using a headache severity rating scale where 0 indicates no pain, 1 indicates mild pain, 2 indicates moderate pain, and 3 indicates severe pain. Patients also documented the presence or absence of associated symptoms at these time points.

- **Patient disability assessment**: This was evaluated with a 4-point item regarding the degree of interference in normal activities due to migraine (none, mild, moderate, requires bed rest).

- **Global impression**: Recorded 2 hours after study drug intake, this was measured on a 7-point scale: very much better, much better, a little better, no change, a little worse, much worse, and very much worse.

The date and exact time when the patient became headache pain-free and experienced meaningful headache pain relief were also recorded.

### Triptan nonresponders: Do they exist and who are they [^112cEXQP]? Cephalalgia (2013). Low credibility.

Triptans represent the best treatment option for most migraine attacks, although this is not as well studied as it might be in controlled trials. Their efficacy and tolerability vary both between agents and from patient to patient, with about 30%-40% of patients not responding adequately to therapy. As yet unexplained, the failure of one triptan does not predict failure with another; therefore, triptan nonresponders cannot be defined as individuals who have failed a single triptan. Five clinical studies provide evidence that switching from a triptan that is ineffective to a second one can result in effective treatment in a proportion of patients. Systematic studies investigating whether there are patients who do not respond to all triptans in all formulations are lacking.

- **Methods**: Here we discuss the importance of identifying triptan nonresponders, the literature supporting their existence, and the issues to be resolved to design trials to investigate this.

- **Conclusion**: So far, no scientific data about the presence of a triptan nonresponder population are available. We propose a pragmatic study design to assess the existence of this subpopulation, recognizing the complexity of the question and the likelihood that more than one issue is at play in nonresponders.

### Guidelines of the International Headache Society for controlled trials of acute treatment of migraine attacks in adults: Fourth edition [^113Z9CMo]. Cephalalgia (2019). Low credibility.

- **Other primary headaches**: Individuals satisfying criteria for chronic migraine or with a history of chronic migraine in the last 12 months should be excluded from pivotal efficacy trials for the acute treatment of migraine. In subsequent trials, exploration of the benefits of new acute treatments in subjects with chronic migraine is needed. Subjects with other concomitant primary headache types (e.g. tension-type headache) are allowed if attacks are infrequent (i.e. present on an average of < 1 day/month and < 12 days/year) and can be differentiated from migraine based on the quality of pain and associated symptoms.

	- **Comments**: Individuals with chronic migraine are excluded from the initial clinical trials of acute treatment because they may complicate analyses of efficacy in undifferentiated populations. Subjects with migraine may have other primary headache types, including tension-type headache. Those experiencing primary headaches that cannot be distinguished from ICHD-defined migraine without aura should be excluded.

- **Secondary headaches**: Individuals with secondary headaches, including medication-overuse headache, should be excluded.

	- **Comments**: Excessive use of acute medications for migraine does not necessarily lead to medication-overuse headache, and some individuals may fulfill IHS criteria for overuse of acute medications without suffering from a chronic pattern of headache.

### Sumatriptan-naproxen sodium in migraine: A review [^112brBax]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Low credibility.

Migraine is a highly prevalent, disabling neurological disease that is marked by attacks of moderate to severe head pain, usually throbbing in quality. When left untreated, these attacks typically last between 4 to 72 hours. They are associated with photophobia, phonophobia, nausea, and/or vomiting. Varied responses to acute medications used for migraine have been observed, with over one-third (34.5%) of patients reporting insufficient headache relief. Migraine has a complex pathophysiology, known only in part, involving multiple components.

In this context, multi-mechanistic therapeutic agents have been developed as optimal acute treatment approaches with the physiological rationale of targeting multiple putative mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of the disorder. Sumatriptan-naproxen sodium is a single, fixed-dose combination tablet comprising sumatriptan 85 mg and naproxen sodium 500 mg (hereafter denoted sumatriptan-naproxen sodium). It was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in April 2008 and is now approved in several European countries as a prescribed medication.

It is formulated as a bilayer tablet that includes RT technology (RT: fast disintegrating/rapid release tablet), enabling rapid disintegration and release of sumatriptan, thereby promoting content dispersal. Triptans and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may target separate aspects of the potential pathophysiology of migraine. Together, they hypothetically prevent or reduce both peripheral activation of central pain pathways and central pathway activation during the early stages.

### Comparison of healthcare resource utilization and costs among patients with migraine with potentially adequate and insufficient triptan response [^111hmLQE]. Cephalalgia (2020). Low credibility.

Our finding on the high rates of opioid use among the potential TIR patients is surprising in light of the broad recommendations to avoid opioids as acute treatments for migraine. This may reflect the limited availability of well-tolerated and effective treatments for migraine attacks not adequately managed by triptans. Post-hoc analyses confirmed that the vast majority (70%) of the TIR patients using opioids during the 12-month post-index follow-up did not have any opioid use prior to the initiation of triptans. These findings are similar to another study, which reported that among those who switched from triptans to a new medication class after initial triptan fill, approximately half switched to an opioid.

This suggests that real-world treatment patterns deviate from clinical guidelines, including the AHS Consensus Statement of trying two oral triptans prior to switching medication classes. While switching between triptans has not demonstrated any clinical benefit or cost savings, augmenting treatment with opioids, barbiturates, and NSAIDs also does not improve headache-related disability. While our study results are based on US data, where opioid use for migraine is a well-recognized problem, opioids were reported to be the second most common treatment for migraine (after triptans) in a survey of self-diagnosed individuals with migraine across 17 European countries. This suggests that opioid use is a problem that extends beyond the US.

Although several programs have been put in place to manage opioid use in the US, the findings reported here demonstrate the need to pay special attention to…

### Guidelines of the International Headache Society for controlled trials of acute treatment of migraine attacks in adults: Fourth edition [^116cNEue]. Cephalalgia (2019). Low credibility.

- **Headache relief**: Recommendations:
	1. Headache relief, defined as the decrease in headache pain from moderate or severe at baseline to mild or none at 2 hours after treatment and before taking any rescue medication (refer to Section 1.2.11), should be used as a secondary efficacy measure.

	2. A time point before 2 hours after treatment can be used when testing parenteral treatments.

- **Comments**: Headache relief should be used as an outcome measure, but only as a secondary endpoint and mainly to facilitate comparison of the results of new clinical trials with those of previous programs. Since headache relief is associated with the relief of disability, it can be used in clinical trials as a proxy for pain improvement and restoration of function. Headache relief is also useful for comprehensive cost of treatment analyses.

In older acute migraine clinical trials, headache relief at 2 hours after treatment was used extensively as a primary efficacy outcome based on the suggestion that patients may consider an acute treatment effective while residual headache pain persists. The validity of this argument has been challenged by evidence showing that patients do not believe a reduction in headache pain from moderate to mild constitutes success and expect acute treatment to provide freedom from pain. In addition, the headache relief endpoint assumes that the magnitude of change from severe pain to no pain is clinically equivalent to the change from moderate pain to mild pain, which is not the case.

### Sumatriptan-naproxen sodium in migraine: A review [^113xsJeu]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Low credibility.

The superior effectiveness of the sumatriptan‐naproxen combination tablet over placebo and its constituent elements has been reported in multiple, replicate, randomized, placebo‐controlled studies of single and multiple attacks of migraine across varying intensities of pain. The data suggest the medications work in synergy to produce more effective acute relief of migraine symptoms. In addition, other clinical benefits, such as increased patient satisfaction, improved functioning, and improved migraine‐specific quality of life indicators, have been reported. Notably, participants in the studies were without known sumatriptan contraindications.

Herein, we present the results of a narrative review addressing the pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, therapeutic efficacy, and tolerability of sumatriptan‐naproxen sodium across a range of populations with migraine, including adults and adolescents, alongside individuals with poor responses to short‐acting triptans, menstrual migraine, probable migraine, and allodynia. We consider crossover trial data comparing the effectiveness of sumatriptan‐naproxen sodium to its key counterparts in the acute management of migraine and acknowledge the missing data that must be collected to place this medication correctly into the treatment armamentarium of migraine.

### Diagnosis and management of migraine in ten steps [^114e7SpV]. Nature Reviews Neurology (2021). Low credibility.

- **Third-line medication**: If all available triptans fail after an adequate trial period (no or insufficient therapeutic response in at least three consecutive attacks) or their use is contraindicated, alternatives are currently limited. Ditans or gepants could be used, but their availability is currently very limited. Lasmiditan is the only ditan approved for acute treatment of migraine, and ubrogepant and rimegepant are the only gepants approved. Indirect comparison of data from randomized controlled trials suggests that the efficacy of lasmiditan is comparable to that of triptans; however, its use is associated with temporary driving impairment, which is likely to discourage widespread use. Individuals who take lasmiditan might be unable to self-assess their driving competence and should not operate machinery for at least 8 hours after intake.

- **Adjunct medication**: For patients who experience nausea and/or vomiting during migraine attacks, prokinetic antiemetics such as domperidone and metoclopramide are useful oral adjuncts.

- **Medications to avoid**: Oral ergot alkaloids are poorly effective and potentially toxic, and should not be used as a substitute for triptans. The efficacy of opioids and barbiturates is questionable, and both are associated with considerable adverse effects and the risk of dependency. All of these medications should, therefore, be avoided for the acute treatment of migraine.

- **Recommendations**: Offer acute medication to everyone who experiences migraine attacks. Advise use of acute medications early in the headache phase of the attack, as effectiveness depends on.

### Eletriptan for acute migraine [^112izWgK]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2001). Low credibility.

Eletriptan (Relpax) is a new triptan soon to be made available by prescription for the treatment of acute migraine. Currently, five triptans are available by prescription, and more are under development. In light of the many drugs for treating acute migraine, there is a need for evidence-based assessments to help determine the relative efficacy and harm of these treatments.

- **Objectives**: To determine the efficacy of eletriptan for treating a single migraine attack using the outcomes of headache response and pain-free response at 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 hours, and sustained relief over 24 hours. To express efficacy in terms of number-needed-to-treat (NNT). To determine the adverse effects of a single dose of eletriptan and express this in terms of number-needed-to-harm (NNH). To allow for the comparison of the efficacy of eletriptan with other migraine treatments evaluated systematically in the same way.

- **Search strategy**: Data from all Phase III randomized placebo-controlled trials were made available by the manufacturer, Pfizer Inc. At the time of writing, these trials comprise the only data on eletriptan relevant to this review in a published or unpublished form; thus, searches of electronic databases for further trials of eletriptan were not conducted.

- **Selection criteria**: Trials of eletriptan for acute migraine; randomized allocation to treatment groups, including a placebo group; double-blind design; International Headache Society diagnostic criteria for migraine with or without aura; single migraine attack; single-dose treatment at standard doses; adult population; baseline pain of

### Comparison of healthcare resource utilization and costs among patients with migraine with potentially adequate and insufficient triptan response [^111X7yrW]. Cephalalgia (2020). Low credibility.

**Statistical analysis**: Sample demographic and clinical characteristics of potential TIR patients and triptan-only continuers (i.e. potentially adequate triptan responders) were assessed using descriptive statistics. Mean unadjusted healthcare resource use and cost outcomes were estimated in the two study groups. Multivariate regression analyses were conducted to estimate the differences in healthcare resource use and cost outcomes between both groups. Specifically, multivariate logistic regressions were estimated for the binary outcomes of hospitalization and ED visits. Multivariate generalized linear models (GLM) with links selected by use of the Pearson correlation test, the Pregibon link test, and the modified Hosmer and Lemeshow test, and families selected by the modified Park test were estimated for the remaining healthcare resource use and cost outcomes. The adjusted estimates for the healthcare resource use and cost outcomes were calculated using the method of recycled predictions. Demographic characteristics included in the models were age, gender, geographic region, and type of insurance plan. Clinical covariates included Elixhauser comorbidities; relevant migraine-related comorbidities of anxiety and mood disorders, allergic rhinitis, pain (chronic pain, central pain, psychogenic pain, other pain, neck pain, back pain, fibromyalgia), and sleep disturbances; and cardiovascular comorbidities wherein triptans have warnings or contraindications (hypertension, hyperlipidemia, obesity, and ischemic disease including ischemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, and peripheral vascular disease).

### Sumatriptan-naproxen sodium in migraine: A review [^117Tfm8q]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Low credibility.

- **Pharmacodynamic properties**: Sumatriptan is a highly selective 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) receptor agonist that exerts its effects primarily through the 5HT 1B/1D receptors, with much lesser effects on the 5-HT 1A, 5-HT 1E, or 5-HT 1F receptors. Vascular 5HT 1B receptors are mainly located in the cerebral and dural vessels, while 5HT 1D receptors are located in nervous tissue. Activation of these receptors results in the vasoconstriction of large cerebral and meningeal blood vessels, reduction of neurogenic vasodilation, and decreased transmission of pain impulses from second-order neurons to the trigeminal nucleus caudalis. Triptans may impair the activation of central pathways during the early stages of a migraine attack by inhibiting transmission between peripheral and central neurons.

	- Naproxen, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), inhibits the biosynthesis of prostanoids by competitively binding to inhibit both cyclooxygenase (COX) isoenzymes, COX-1 and COX-2. It has greater COX-1 selectivity, providing a favorable cardiovascular safety profile among NSAIDs, resulting in effective analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects. COX-1 and COX-2 catalyze the conversion of free arachidonic acid to prostaglandin G2 (PGG2) and then to PGH2. Tissue-specific isomerases and synthases further transform PGH2 into various prostanoids, such as prostaglandin (PGE2), prostacyclin (PGI2), PGD2, PGF2α, and thromboxane (Tx)A2. Through this mechanism, some suggest, based on laboratory data, that NSAIDs may reduce meningeal inflammation, which may contribute to pain and neuronal activation.

### Comparison of healthcare resource utilization and costs among patients with migraine with potentially adequate and insufficient triptan response [^111QwJqE]. Cephalalgia (2020). Low credibility.

Triptans are the most commonly prescribed acute treatments for migraine; however, not all triptan users experience an adequate response. Information on real-world resource use and costs associated with triptan insufficient response is limited.

- **Methods**: A retrospective claims analysis using US commercial health plan data between 2012 and 2015 assessed healthcare resource use and costs in adults with a migraine diagnosis newly initiating triptans. Patients who either did not refill triptans but used other non-triptan medications or refilled triptans but also filled non-triptan medications over a 24-month follow-up period were designated as potential triptan insufficient responders. Patients who continued filling only triptans (i.e. triptan-only continuers) were designated as potential adequate responders. The study compared all-cause and migraine-related resource use and total (medical and pharmacy) costs over months 1–12 and months 13–24 between triptan-only continuers and potential triptan insufficient responders.

- **Results**: Among 10,509 new triptan users, 4,371 (41%) were triptan-only continuers, 3,102 (30%) were potential triptan insufficient responders, and 3,036 (29%) did not refill their index triptan or fill non-triptan medications over the 24-month follow-up. Opioids were the most commonly used non-triptan treatment (68%) among potential triptan insufficient responders over 24 months of follow-up. Adjusted mean all-cause and migraine-related total costs were $5,449 and $2,905 higher, respectively, among potential triptan insufficient responders versus triptan-only continuers.
