## Question

Should I check cortisol levels

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether they should check cortisol levels, and under what circumstances. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical scenario driving the question. Then, I should verify which cortisol test is appropriate for that scenario. Next, I will review pre-analytical preparation, including medication holds and timing. After that, I need to interpret results using validated thresholds and consider assay variability. Finally, I should outline next steps, including when to use dynamic testing, when to treat empirically, and when to refer to endocrinology [^111cmN7E].

> Let me first confirm the clinical context because the decision to check cortisol hinges on why we are testing. Common scenarios include glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency during or after taper, suspected primary or secondary adrenal insufficiency, suspected Cushing's syndrome, critical illness-related corticosteroid insufficiency, and special populations such as children, patients on immune checkpoint inhibitors, or those with pituitary disease; I need to ensure I match the test to the question to avoid misinterpretation [^111cmN7E] [^1127eNwT] [^117YFD2H].

> For glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency, I should confirm that testing is reserved for patients tapered to physiologic replacement doses who are aiming to discontinue therapy; routine testing while on supraphysiologic doses is not recommended, and morning serum cortisol is the first-line test to assess HPA axis recovery, ideally drawn between 8:00 and 9:00 AM after holding the last glucocorticoid dose for at least 24 hours, avoiding dexamethasone if possible because of its long half-life [^1155kHPq] [^114Pxsdc] [^112CTWvK].

> Wait, let me verify the thresholds before I jump ahead. I initially thought a morning cortisol above 15 μg/dL universally excludes adrenal insufficiency, but hold on, that 15 μg/dL cut-off applies to central adrenal insufficiency and not directly to glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency; for glucocorticoid-induced suppression, values above 300 nmol/L (10 μg/dL) suggest recovery and glucocorticoids can be stopped, values between 150 and 300 nmol/L (5–10 μg/dL) warrant continued physiologic replacement with repeat testing, and values below 150 nmol/L (5 μg/dL) indicate persistent suppression and continued replacement with reassessment in a few months, recognizing these are guides and assay variability matters [^112evbvj] [^114Pxsdc] [^112RBXX5].

> I should double-check whether dynamic testing is needed here. The 2024 ESE/ES guideline suggests against routinely performing dynamic testing during glucocorticoid taper; if morning cortisol remains indeterminate and clinical uncertainty persists, a 250 μg ACTH stimulation test can be considered, with peak cortisol less than 500 nmol/L (18.1 μg/dL) at 30 or 60 minutes indicating adrenal insufficiency, but I need to ensure glucocorticoids are held appropriately to avoid interference [^113rP5jg] [^115U2i6n] [^1163dMvT].

> For suspected primary adrenal insufficiency outside the glucocorticoid-taper context, I need to check that the short corticotropin stimulation test remains the gold standard, with a 250 μg ACTH test and a peak cortisol less than 500 nmol/L (18 μg/dL) confirming the diagnosis; if testing is delayed or not feasible, a very low morning cortisol less than 140 nmol/L (5 μg/dL) with elevated ACTH is strongly suggestive, but I should confirm with stimulation testing when possible to avoid misclassification [^112ik7E1] [^111z7W17] [^112hy7cT].

> For central adrenal insufficiency, let me consider first-line screening. An 8–9 AM cortisol is appropriate, with values less than 3 μg/dL strongly suggesting AI and values greater than 15 μg/dL making AI unlikely; for indeterminate values between 3 and 15 μg/dL, I should proceed to ACTH stimulation testing, keeping in mind that testing should occur at least 18–24 hours after the last hydrocortisone dose to avoid assay interference [^111L5ei8] [^111XaNxD].

> But wait, what if the question is Cushing's syndrome rather than adrenal insufficiency. I need to ensure I do not use a random serum cortisol to screen; instead, I should use one of the recommended first-line tests such as 24-hour urinary free cortisol, late-night salivary cortisol, or a 1-mg overnight dexamethasone suppression test, and I should repeat at least two measurements given variability; a morning cortisol greater than 1.8 μg/dL after 1 mg dexamethasone is abnormal and warrants further evaluation, and I must exclude exogenous glucocorticoids before any biochemical testing [^1143MjBU] [^112KfWjM] [^112p8EZp].

> In critical illness, I should confirm that routine adrenal function testing is not recommended to diagnose CIRCI; if clinicians elect to test, a random total cortisol less than 10 μg/dL or a delta cortisol less than 9 μg/dL after 250 μg ACTH may be used, but the task force suggests against measuring free cortisol or salivary cortisol over total cortisol, and I need to remember that treatment decisions should be primarily clinical rather than test-driven in this setting [^117YFD2H] [^117FiDLL] [^1176W76Q].

> Next, I should review pre-analytical preparation because it materially affects interpretation. I need to ensure morning samples are drawn between 8:00 and 9:00 AM when feasible, that glucocorticoids are held for at least 24 hours before testing, and that long-acting agents like dexamethasone are avoided in the taper if testing is planned; I also need to check for estrogen therapy, which raises CBG and total cortisol, and either stop estrogen-containing drugs 4–6 weeks before testing or interpret results in light of CBG, and I should confirm that spironolactone and some antiepileptics can interfere with assays and are held on the day of testing when possible [^1155kHPq] [^116SWHsn] [^112kPCiL].

> Hold on, I should verify assay-related caveats. Total cortisol assays measure both bound and free hormone, and binding changes in illness, liver disease, nephrotic syndrome, or pregnancy can alter total cortisol independent of bioactivity; some centers advocate salivary cortisol in cirrhosis where CBG is low, but for CIRCI the guidelines favor total cortisol over free or salivary measures, so I need to align interpretation with the clinical context and local assay characteristics [^113GoRva] [^117YFD2H] [^1176W76Q].

> I will now examine pediatric considerations briefly. In children with acute illness, random cortisol levels can be very high and diurnal variation is lost, so I should avoid using adult morning cutoffs; in children discontinuing systemic glucocorticoids, screening for adrenal suppression is reasonable, and in those exposed to cranial radiation at doses 30 Gy or higher, annual 8 AM cortisol with referral if less than 13 μg/dL is recommended, with counseling on stress dosing and medical alert identification [^11763PHv] [^116PUM1Q] [^113yVarC].

> Let me reconsider special populations and medications. Patients on immune checkpoint inhibitors can develop primary adrenal insufficiency; if suspected, I should check morning cortisol and ACTH, add CMP, and proceed to cosyntropin stimulation if indeterminate, while remembering that concomitant exogenous steroids can confound results; in those using high-dose inhaled, topical, or intra-articular steroids, or CYP3A4 inhibitors, I should maintain a high index of suspicion for glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency even without systemic therapy [^1127eNwT] [^112oEV7G] [^1174L1xv].

> I should confirm safety-netting and follow-up. For patients with intermediate morning cortisol values or ongoing clinical concern, I need to arrange repeat morning cortisol in weeks to months and provide clear sick-day rules and emergency hydrocortisone; if recovery is not evident after a year on physiologic replacement or if there has been an adrenal crisis, referral to endocrinology is appropriate, and I must remember that dynamic testing is optional rather than routine in glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency [^112evbvj] [^115huAMA] [^113rP5jg].

> In summary, I need to ensure the test matches the question: use morning serum cortisol to assess HPA recovery during glucocorticoid taper, ACTH stimulation to confirm primary or central adrenal insufficiency, and UFC, late-night salivary cortisol, or 1-mg DST to screen for Cushing's; I should double-check medication holds, timing, and assay issues before interpreting any single value, and I should treat clinically when adrenal crisis is suspected rather than waiting for results [^1155kHPq] [^112ik7E1] [^1143MjBU].

You should check cortisol levels when there is **clinical suspicion of adrenal insufficiency** [^111cmN7E] or **Cushing's syndrome** [^1143MjBU], or when evaluating recovery of the HPA axis during glucocorticoid tapering [^112CTWvK]. Morning (8–9 AM) serum cortisol is the **first-line test** [^111L5ei8]; values < 5 µg/dL suggest adrenal insufficiency, > 15 µg/dL generally exclude it, and intermediate values require confirmatory testing [^112hy7cT] [^111L5ei8]. For suspected Cushing's, use 24-hour urinary free cortisol, late-night salivary cortisol, or a 1-mg dexamethasone suppression test [^1143MjBU] [^115H6qjN]. In critically ill patients, interpret random cortisol with caution and avoid routine testing unless clinically indicated [^117E9bXk]. Always interpret results in clinical context and consider assay variability [^111132b8] [^114FWJtw].

## Clinical indications for cortisol testing

Cortisol testing is indicated in several clinical scenarios, including:

- **Suspected adrenal insufficiency**: Primary (Addison's disease), secondary (pituitary or hypothalamic), or glucocorticoid-induced [^111cmN7E].

- **Suspected Cushing's syndrome**: Chronic exposure to excess cortisol [^116NACQu].

- **Evaluation of HPA axis recovery**: After chronic glucocorticoid therapy or treatment of Cushing's syndrome [^114Pxsdc] [^1115FA5f].

- **Critical illness-related corticosteroid insufficiency (CIRCI)**: Controversial but considered in specific ICU settings [^117FiDLL].

## Recommended cortisol tests and their clinical applications

| **Test** | **Clinical application** | **Indication** |
|-|-|-|
| Morning serum cortisol (8–9 AM) | First-line test for adrenal insufficiency | Suspected primary or secondary adrenal insufficiency [^111cmN7E] |
| ACTH stimulation test (cosyntropin test) | Gold standard for adrenal insufficiency | Confirmatory test for adrenal insufficiency [^112ik7E1] |
| 24-hour urinary free cortisol (UFC) | Screening for Cushing's syndrome | Suspected Cushing's syndrome [^1143MjBU] |
| Late-night salivary cortisol | Screening for Cushing's syndrome | Suspected Cushing's syndrome [^115H6qjN] |
| 1-mg overnight dexamethasone suppression test (DST) | Screening for Cushing's syndrome | Suspected Cushing's syndrome [^1143MjBU] |
| Random serum cortisol | Limited utility; interpret cautiously | Critically ill patients; not routine [^116Uhyfj] |

## Interpretation of cortisol test results

### Morning serum cortisol

Morning serum cortisol is the **first-line test** for adrenal insufficiency [^111L5ei8]. Interpretation uses pragmatic thresholds: **< 5 µg/dL** is highly suggestive of adrenal insufficiency, **> 15 µg/dL** generally excludes adrenal insufficiency, and **5–15 µg/dL** is indeterminate and requires further testing (e.g. ACTH stimulation test) [^notfound].

---

### ACTH stimulation test

The ACTH stimulation test is the **gold standard** for diagnosing adrenal insufficiency [^112ik7E1]. A **peak cortisol < 18.1 µg/dL (500 nmol/L)** at 30 or 60 minutes after ACTH administration indicates adrenal insufficiency [^111L5ei8].

---

### Cushing's syndrome screening tests

- **24-hour UFC**: Elevated levels suggest Cushing's syndrome [^112p8EZp].

- **Late-night salivary cortisol**: Elevated levels suggest Cushing's syndrome [^112p8EZp].

- **1-mg overnight DST**: Failure to suppress cortisol below 1.8 µg/dL (50 nmol/L) suggests Cushing's syndrome [^notfound].

---

## Special considerations and limitations

- **Assay variability**: Different assays may yield varying results; interpret cautiously [^111hsJH7].

- **Medication interference**: Estrogen therapy, glucocorticoids, and other drugs can affect cortisol levels [^116SWHsn].

- **Critical illness**: Random cortisol levels are unreliable; interpret in clinical context [^117FiDLL].

- **Pediatric considerations**: Use age-appropriate reference ranges and tests [^111z7W17].

---

## Clinical scenarios where cortisol testing is not recommended

Routine cortisol testing is **not recommended** in asymptomatic individuals without risk factors, patients on stable glucocorticoid therapy without symptoms, or those with isolated, nonspecific symptoms (e.g. fatigue, weight loss) without other clinical evidence of adrenal dysfunction.

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Suspected adrenal insufficiency**: Morning serum cortisol (8–9 AM); confirm with ACTH stimulation test if indeterminate [^111L5ei8].

- **Suspected Cushing's syndrome**: Use 24-hour UFC, late-night salivary cortisol, or 1-mg overnight DST [^1143MjBU].

- **Critical illness**: Interpret random cortisol cautiously; avoid routine testing unless clinically indicated [^116Uhyfj].

- **Always interpret results in clinical context** and consider assay variability and medication interference [^114FWJtw].

---

Cortisol testing is indicated when there is clinical suspicion of adrenal insufficiency or Cushing's syndrome, or when evaluating HPA axis recovery. Morning serum cortisol is the **first-line test**, with confirmatory testing as needed. Interpret results in clinical context, considering assay variability and medication interference.

Glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency — biochemical confirmation pathway: In patients receiving supraphysiologic glucocorticoid doses and at high risk of adrenal insufficiency, taper down glucocorticoids to physiologic replacement doses (avoid dexamethasone), then in Scenario 2 measure early-morning serum cortisol 24 hours after the last glucocorticoid dose. A likelihood bar from HIGH to LOW displays cortisol thresholds at 150 nmol/L 5.0 μg/dL and 300 nmol/L 10.0 μg/dL. Actions presented are to continue glucocorticoid replacement and re-check early-morning cortisol after a few months, continue glucocorticoid replacement and re-check early-morning cortisol after a few weeks and consider dynamic testing, or stop glucocorticoid replacement. Separately, we suggest that if the result is < 150 nmol/L or 5 μg/dL, the physiologic glucocorticoid dose should be continued, and the morning cortisol repeated after a few months.

### European Society of Endocrinology and endocrine society joint clinical guideline: diagnosis and therapy of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency [^114Pxsdc]. European Journal of Endocrinology (2024). High credibility.

Glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency — morning serum cortisol testing is the recommended test to examine for recovery of HPA axis following glucocorticoid therapy, obtained as a morning serum cortisol level measured between 8:00 and 9:00 AM after holding glucocorticoid dose for at least 24 hours and only after reaching a physiologic equivalent daily dose such as prednisone 4–6 mg daily or hydrocortisone 15–25 mg total daily dose. Given assay variability, we consider cortisol values greater than 300 nmol/L (10 μg/dL) as a reasonable threshold to indicate recovery of HPA function following glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency; in patients with higher serum cortisol levels but below 300 nmol/L (10 μg/dL), HPA axis recovery is possible and we suggest that the most cost-effective and practical strategy is that these patients continue with physiologic daily dose equivalent glucocorticoid replacement and have morning serum cortisol re-checked every few weeks until recovery occurs, and if cortisol levels remain between 150 nmol/L (5 μg/dL) and 300 nmol/L (10 μg/dL), dynamic testing can be considered. Supporting data include that in suspected primary or secondary adrenal insufficiency, morning cortisol ≥ 354 nmol/L (12.8 μg/dL) predicted normal adrenal function with 100% sensitivity, and in patients recovering from endogenous hypercortisolism, morning cortisol ≥ 276 nmol/L (10.0 μg/dL) was associated with no reported symptoms of glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome or instances of adrenal crises.

### Cortisol levels during acute illnesses in children and adolescents: a systematic review [^11763PHv]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Importance

Endogenous cortisol levels in children and adolescents during acute illnesses can contribute to the evidence base required to optimize glucocorticoid (GC) stress doses for children and adolescents known to have GC deficiency.

Objective

To identify endogenous cortisol levels during a range of acute illnesses in children and adolescents without GC deficiency from published evidence.

Evidence Review

CINAHL, Cochrane Library, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Embase, and MEDLINE were searched for studies published between January 1, 2000, and June 30, 2020. Two reviewers independently identified relevant studies. Differences were resolved by joint discussion. Inclusion criteria were common acute illnesses, age from 1 month to 18 years, and basal blood cortisol levels obtained within 48 hours of presentation. Studies with fewer than 5 participants and those that included participants known to have GC deficiency or a history of treatment that could affect cortisol levels were excluded from the review. Data for predefined fields were extracted and independently checked by separate pairs of reviewers. Overall weighted means and pooled SDs for cortisol levels were calculated.

Findings

All 15 studies included were hospital based and included 864 unique participants: 14 studies were prospective observational studies, 1 was part of a trial, and 5 included control individuals. Mean cortisol levels were higher in all participants with an acute illness (n = 689) than in controls (n = 175) (difference in weighted means, 18.95 μg/dL; 95% CI, 16.68–21.22 μg/dL). Cortisol levels were highest in patients with bacterial meningitis (weighted mean [pooled SD], 46.42 [22.24] μg/dL) and were more than 3-fold higher in the group with severe gastroenteritis (weighted mean [pooled SD], 39.64 [21.34] μg/dL) than in the control group. Among the subgroups with sepsis, those with shock had lower cortisol levels than those without shock (weighted mean [pooled SD], 27.83 [36.39] μg/dL vs 37.00 [23.30] μg/dL), but levels in nonsurvivors did not differ from levels in survivors (weighted mean [pooled SD], 24.89 [51.65] μg/dL vs 30.53 [30.60] μg/dL).

Conclusions and Relevance

This systematic review found that, in children and adolescents without GC deficiency, circulating cortisol levels were higher during acute illnesses than those in controls and also varied across a range of acute illnesses. Whether these levels need to be achieved with exogenous GC stress doses tailored according to the nature and severity of the illness in children and adolescents with GC deficiency warrants investigation.

In patients with higher serum cortisol levels but below 300 nmol/L (10 μg/dL), HPA axis recovery is possible. In such cases, we suggest that the most cost-effective and practical strategy is that these patients continue with physiologic daily dose equivalent glucocorticoid replacement and have morning serum cortisol re-checked every few weeks until recovery occurs. If cortisol levels remain between 150 nmol/L (5 μg/dL) and 300 nmol/L (10 μg/dL), dynamic testing can be considered.

In a study of patients with suspected primary or secondary adrenal insufficiency, morning cortisol ≥ 354 nmol/L (12.8 μg/dL) predicted normal adrenal function with 100% sensitivity. One might also extrapolate some of the cut-off values from experiences with therapy of endogenous Cushing syndrome. In patients recovering from endogenous hypercortisolism, morning cortisol ≥ 276 nmol/L (10.0 μg/dL) was associated with no reported symptoms of glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome or instances of adrenal crisis. Given these considerations, and the fact that there is substantial variability in the calibration between different cortisol assays, we consider cortisol values greater than 300 nmol/L (10 μg/dL) as a reasonable threshold to indicate recovery of HPA function following glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency.

Morning serum cortisol thresholds for recovery of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis: If confirmation of recovery is desired, we recommend morning serum cortisol as the first test and consider values as a continuum. As a guide, we suggest recovery if cortisol is > 300 nmol/L or 10 µg/dL and glucocorticoids can be stopped safely; we suggest continuing the physiologic dose and repeating morning cortisol when results are between 150 nmol/L or 5 µg/dL and 300 nmol/L or 10 µg/dL; and we suggest continuing the physiologic dose and repeating morning cortisol after a few months when results are < 150 nmol/L or 5 µg/dL.

### How should we interrogate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis in patients with suspected hypopituitarism? [^111132b8]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusion

The choice of test used to interrogate the HPA axis should be individualised for each patient and the results interpreted within clinical context and with understanding of potential pitfalls of the test used. An alternative test should be performed if the result is borderline and clinical suspicion is high. Clinical vigilance is required and patients should be made aware of the symptoms and signs of adrenal insufficiency so that assessment can be repeated if necessary. The results should be interpreted rationally and those with apparent borderline normal/abnormal results or values suggestive of partial ACTH deficiency could be treated with short courses of stress dose of glucocorticoids during incurrent illness only.

### European Society of Endocrinology and endocrine society joint clinical guideline: diagnosis and therapy of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency [^1149kve6]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Studies assessing recovery of HPA axis function through measurement of morning cortisol or low-dose 1 µg ACTH (1–24)-test were not formally included in the systematic review (see "Clinical questions, eligibility criteria, and definition of endpoints'), but reported recovery incidence rates of 17% to 100% within a range of 4 days to 3 years. It is plausible that in studies reporting recovery at re-testing already after a couple of days, initial cortisol levels may have represented adrenal suppression due to remaining circulating long-acting exogenous glucocorticoids rather than true adrenal insufficiency.

Clinical Sub-question Ia: Which Clinical/Biochemical Parameters Predict Recovery of HPA Axis Function in Patients With Glucocorticoid-induced Adrenal Insufficiency?

Both studies included for clinical question I also assessed predictors of recovery of adrenal function. In the study by Baek et al, patients recovering adrenal function had higher cortisol increments during the first ACTH (1–24)-test than patients without recovery (219 vs 99 nmol/L (10.3 vs 6.7 μg/dL), OR 1.58 per μg/dL increase in cortisol, 95%CI 1.02–2.46) when adjusting for confounders, basal cortisol concentration and basal ACTH levels. In the study by Leong et al, patients recovering adrenal function had higher ambulatory morning cortisol values in between retesting with ACTH (1–24)-test than patients not recovering (286 vs 186 nmol/L (7.9 vs 3.6 μg/dL), OR 1.02 per μg/dL increase in cortisol, 95%CI 1.01–1.04). There were no studies assessing clinical parameters predicting HPA axis recovery.

R 2.7 — Morning serum cortisol for hypothalamus–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis recovery specifies that "we recommend morning serum cortisol as the first test", with sampling as "morning serum cortisol (sample collected between 8:00 and 9:00 AM)". The guideline states "The value of morning serum cortisol should be considered as a continuum" with "suggested cut-offs in nmol/l and μg/dL are not exact conversions but have been rounded to improve clinical applicability in an international context", and provides, "As a guide: 1. we suggest that the test indicates recovery of the HPA axis if cortisol is > 300 nmol/L or 10 μg/dL, and glucocorticoids can be stopped safely"; and also "we suggest that if the result is between 150 nmol/L or 5 μg/dL, and 300 nmol/L or 10 μg/dL", defining an intermediate range. When "adrenal insufficiency is documented, exogenous glucocorticoid should not be reduced below the lower end of physiologic replacement dose ranges", and "Patients should be retested according to recommendations in 2.7, and further significant dose reduction should only occur with indication of HPA-axis recovery".

### Cortisol levels during acute illnesses in children and adolescents: a systematic review [^116osgps]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Data Extraction

From relevant studies, data for the following predefined fields were extracted by 2 of us (M.R. and M.C.) and checked by 2 others (I.B. and L.P.) independently: country, study design, number of participants, age, sex, timing of cortisol sample, cortisol assay, cortisol levels (mean, median, SD, SEM, IQR, 95% CI, or range), and reference range. For patients, data were also extracted about prior health, prior GC treatment, and nature and severity of the acute illness. The outcome of primary interest was the blood cortisol level and spread for control participants and patients in different acute illness groups.

When data could not be ascertained for a study, the final outcome reflects the mean and SD across the remaining studies. Because data were only missing for the descriptive age variable, rather than the primary outcome cortisol level, it was not deemed necessary or appropriate to use any imputation or sensitivity methods.

Statistical Analysis

For the purpose of the study, cortisol values presented in SI units (nanomoles per liter) were converted using the factor 1/27.6 into conventional units (micrograms per deciliter). All cortisol statistics were converted to mean and SD according to assumptions made by Hozo et aland Wan et al. Overall means and SDs were calculated using means weighted by study sample size under a fixed-effects model and pooled SDs. To compare groups, the difference of the weighted means and corresponding 95% CIs are presented. All analyses were performed using R, version 3.6.0 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing)and the R package meta.

Call your healthcare provider right away if you feel severe lightheadedness or if you faint during treatment with RECORLEV.

Low blood electrolyte levels of potassium and magnesium can increase your chances of QT prolongation during treatment with RECORLEV.

Your healthcare provider will check your heart with a test called an electrocardiogram (ECG) and do blood tests to check your blood electrolyte levels before and during treatment with RECORLEV.

RECORLEV should not be taken with certain other medicines that cause QT prolongation. Talk to your healthcare provider about the medicines you are taking before you start taking RECORLEV.

Low cortisol levels (adrenal insufficiency). Adrenal insufficiency is a condition in which the adrenal glands do not make enough steroid hormones, such as cortisol. RECORLEV may cause adrenal function insufficiency by excessively lowering production of cortisol.

Call your healthcare provider right away if you have one or more of the following symptoms, as these may be symptoms of reduced adrenal function:

nausea or vomiting

dizziness

unusual fatigue

low blood pressure (hypotension)

unexplained stomach pain (abdomen)

abnormal electrolyte levels

loss of appetite

low blood sugar (hypoglycemia)

body aches

Your healthcare provider will collect blood or urine samples to measure your cortisol.

What is RECORLEV?

RECORLEV is a prescription medicine used to treat high cortisol (endogenous hypercortisolemia) levels in adult patients with Cushing's syndrome (CS) who cannot have surgery or who have had surgery that did not cure their Cushing's syndrome.
It is not known if RECORLEV is safe and effective for the treatment of fungal infections. RECORLEV is not to be used for treatment of fungal infections.

### European Society of Endocrinology and endocrine society joint clinical guideline: diagnosis and therapy of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency [^112karUa]. European Journal of Endocrinology (2024). High credibility.

Glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency — future research priorities include improving the evidence base and harmonizing cortisol testing. The document states that evidence for most recommendations is low or very low and calls for epidemiology research to define the true risk of adrenal clinical crisis and long-term consequences. It indicates that biomedical and psychosocial research to understand glucocorticoid withdrawal is warranted to better differentiate it from glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency, and that more research is needed to identify glucocorticoids with less hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis suppression and to explore therapeutic strategies such as concurrent HPA axis stimulation to prevent suppression. For diagnostics, it notes a need for harmonization of cortisol assays and asks for cut-off values to be established using mass spectrometry and for clinical care to adapt this measurement for routine cortisol measurements.

Results of the systematic reviews — clinical questions, eligibility, and endpoints: Eligible articles had to include adult patients (≥ 18 years) and biochemical testing using the high-dose (250 µg) short ACTH (1–24) test (Synacthen or cosyntropin), in which 250 µg synthetic ACTH is administered intravenously with serum cortisol measured 30 and 60 minutes after administration; peak cortisol levels ≤ 500 nmol/L (< 18.1 µg/dL), depending on assay, indicate adrenal insufficiency. For clinical question I, the incidence of recovery was calculated as the number with recovery of HPA axis at re-testing (numerator) over the total with glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency tested at baseline (denominator). Case reports/series were excluded, and only studies with ten or more patients, in specified languages, were eligible; authors were contacted when data were insufficient.

### Cortisol and depression: three questions for psychiatry [^117NwvkX]. Psychological Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Cortisol plays a multifaceted role in major depression disorder (MDD). Diurnal rhythms are disturbed, there is increased resistance to the feedback action of glucocorticoids, excess cortisol may induce MDD, basal levels may be higher and the post-awakening cortisol surge accentuated in those at risk for MDD. Does this suggest new avenues for studying MDD or its clinical management?

Method

The relevant literature was reviewed.

Results

Cortisol contributes to genetic variants for the risk for MDD and the way that environmental events amplify risk. The corticoids' influence begins prenatally, but continues into adulthood. The impact of cortisol at each phase depends not only on its interaction with other factors, such as psychological traits and genetic variants, but also on events that have, or have not, occurred previously.

Conclusions

This review suggests that the time is now right for serious consideration of the role of cortisol in a clinical context. Estimates of cortisol levels and the shape of the diurnal rhythm might well guide the understanding of subtypes of MDD and yield additional indicators for optimal treatment. Patients with disturbed cortisol rhythms might benefit from restitution of those rhythms; they may be distinct from those with more generally elevated levels, who might benefit from cortisol blockade. Higher levels of cortisol are a risk for subsequent depression. Should manipulation of cortisol or its receptors be considered as a preventive measure for some of those at very high risk of future MDD, or to reduce other cortisol-related consequences such as long-term cognitive decline?

Critical Care Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

CIRCI diagnosis — free cortisol versus total cortisol: We suggest against using plasma free cortisol level rather than plasma total cortisol for the diagnosis of CIRCI (conditional recommendation, very low quality of evidence). Although free cortisol is the bioactive form, correlation between serum free and total cortisol has been reported as only 50% to 60%, and cohort data are mixed, including a prospective study of 112 critically ill adults showing good correlation before and after 250 μg ACTH, a cohort of 69 critically ill patients in whom both free and total cortisol predicted outcomes, and a 29-adult septic shock cohort with differences over time and after 1 μg ACTH; measurement of serum free cortisol is cumbersome and not widely available, and given the small number of low-quality, inconsistent studies, the task force suggested against measuring plasma free cortisol level over plasma total cortisol level in suspected CIRCI.

Conclusion

Many ICU patients have decreased cortisol levels after prolonged treatment without clinical improvement. Whether there is an adaptation or exhaustion of adrenal function is still to be established. We propose that serum cortisol level testing be repeated in patients with prolonged critical illness, even in those whose initial adrenal function is within normal limits.

Adrenal insufficiency — patients with suspected primary adrenal insufficiency should be tested for AM cortisol and CMP in addition to ACTH stimulation testing. If adrenal insufficiency of any grade is diagnosed, immunotherapy should be temporarily withheld and steroid replacement therapy should be started. Patients with adrenal insufficiency should be monitored for signs of adrenal crisis, such as hemodynamic instability, and a medical alert bracelet should be provided for those who develop adrenal insufficiency.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for corticosteroid-induced adrenal insufficiency, more specifically with respect to confirmation of recovery, ES/ESE 2024 guidelines recommend to obtain morning serum cortisol testing if confirmation of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis recovery is desired. Recognize that the value of morning serum cortisol is a continuum, with higher values indicating a greater likelihood of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis recovery.

### European Society of Endocrinology and endocrine society joint clinical guideline: diagnosis and therapy of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency [^117JUADt]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Rationale

Due to the ease/convenience of testing, experience and validation, a morning serum cortisol level (measured between 8:00 and 9:00, after holding glucocorticoid dose for at least 24 hours) is the recommended test to examine for recovery of HPA axis following glucocorticoid therapy (see also results of Clinical Question III). The test should be done only after reaching the range of a physiologic equivalent daily dose (eg, prednisone 4–6 mg daily or hydrocortisone 15–25 mg total daily dose, see Definitions). Several other approaches to HPA axis assessment exist, including measurement of waking salivary cortisone, morning DHEA-S measurement, 250 µg ACTH (1–24)-test, overnight metyrapone test and insulin tolerance test. However, the literature comparing different tests for adrenal insufficiency in the context of glucocorticoid use is very limited; importantly, test results are hardly related to clinically relevant outcomes (see section 3). Assessment should be done at least 24 hours after the last dose of glucocorticoids (excluding dexamethasone). It should be emphasized that biochemical testing for adrenal insufficiency is sensitive, but not specific. Persistence of biochemical suppression or insufficient recovery of HPA axis is a prerequisite for clinical adrenal insufficiency, yet even amongst those patients with biochemical insufficiency, the risk for clinically meaningful adrenal insufficiency and adrenal crisis remains very low. Due to the low prevalence of clinically relevant adrenal insufficiency despite the high prevalence of biochemical adrenal insufficiency following a glucocorticoid taper, testing can provide a safeguard in identifying those less at risk but is not a prerequisite for continued tapering.

Although proposing a serum cortisol cut-off of 300 nmol/L (10 μg/dL) as a guide, the panel suggests that the value of serum cortisol is considered as a continuum, rather than an arbitrary cut-off, with higher values more likely to indicate HPA axis recovery. Patients with very low morning cortisol levels (as a guide: < 150 nmol/L (5 μg/dL)) are very likely to have persistent adrenal insufficiency. In such cases, dynamic testing is unlikely to be useful. We recommend that these patients continue with physiologic daily dose equivalent glucocorticoid replacement aiming for the lowest safe dose and undergo repeat morning cortisol testing until recovery occurs. As a general guide, the glucocorticoid dose should provide sufficient replacement, but also a sufficient stimulus for recovery (meaning avoiding any over-replacement). Frequency of repeat measuring may range between 1 to 6 months, depending on the dose and length of glucocorticoid therapy and the prior trajectory of cortisol values.

### Diagnosis and treatment of primary adrenal insufficiency: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^112ik7E1]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

This clinical practice guideline addresses the diagnosis and treatment of primary adrenal insufficiency.

Participants

The Task Force included a chair, selected by The Clinical Guidelines Subcommittee of the Endocrine Society, eight additional clinicians experienced with the disease, a methodologist, and a medical writer. The co-sponsoring associations (European Society of Endocrinology and the American Association for Clinical Chemistry) had participating members. The Task Force received no corporate funding or remuneration in connection with this review.

Evidence

This evidence-based guideline was developed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system to determine the strength of recommendations and the quality of evidence.

Consensus Process

The evidence used to formulate recommendations was derived from two commissioned systematic reviews as well as other published systematic reviews and studies identified by the Task Force. The guideline was reviewed and approved sequentially by the Endocrine Society's Clinical Guidelines Subcommittee and Clinical Affairs Core Committee, members responding to a web posting, and the Endocrine Society Council. At each stage, the Task Force incorporated changes in response to written comments.

Conclusions

We recommend diagnostic tests for the exclusion of primary adrenal insufficiency in all patients with indicative clinical symptoms or signs. In particular, we suggest a low diagnostic (and therapeutic) threshold in acutely ill patients, as well as in patients with predisposing factors. This is also recommended for pregnant women with unexplained persistent nausea, fatigue, and hypotension. We recommend a short corticotropin test (250 μg) as the "gold standard" diagnostic tool to establish the diagnosis. If a short corticotropin test is not possible in the first instance, we recommend an initial screening procedure comprising the measurement of morning plasma ACTH and cortisol levels. Diagnosis of the underlying cause should include a validated assay of autoantibodies against 21-hydroxylase. In autoantibody-negative individuals, other causes should be sought. We recommend once-daily fludrocortisone (median, 0.1 mg) and hydrocortisone (15–25 mg/d) or cortisone acetate replacement (20–35 mg/d) applied in two to three daily doses in adults. In children, hydrocortisone (∼8 mg/m(2)/d) is recommended. Patients should be educated about stress dosing and equipped with a steroid card and glucocorticoid preparation for parenteral emergency administration. Follow-up should aim at monitoring appropriate dosing of corticosteroids and associated autoimmune diseases, particularly autoimmune thyroid disease.

Critical illness-related corticosteroid insufficiency (CIRCI) diagnosis — testing guidance states that the task force was unable to reach agreement on a single test that can reliably diagnose CIRCI, although delta cortisol (change in baseline cortisol at 60 min of < 9 μg/dL) after cosyntropin (250 μg) administration and a random plasma cortisol of < 10 μg/dL may be used by clinicians. We suggest against using plasma-free cortisol or salivary cortisol level over plasma total cortisol (conditional, very low quality of evidence).

Adrenal

Primary adrenal insufficiency is a rare irAE. It can present with non-specific symptoms such as fatigue, nausea or weight loss, although occasionally skin hyperpigmentation from raised

ACTH is noted. Diagnosis is therefore generally made from biochemistry results, with low cortisol and normal or high levels of ACTH. Anti-21-hydroxylase and adrenal cortex antibody levels should be checked to detect auto-antibodies induced by CPI therapy.

Glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency — important considerations and stress precautions: The figure states that the proposed cortisol cut-offs are only a guide and may vary according to the cortisol assay used and local protocols, that they only apply to patients who are not under major stress, and that they do not apply to subjects with abnormal CBG and albumin. Footnotes add that exogenous glucocorticoid should not be reduced below the lower end of the physiologic replacement dose range; that some patients with cortisol values close to the proposed 300 nmol/L (10 μg/dL) cut-off may have suboptimal cortisol response when exposed to major stress, so clinicians should rely on clinical judgment, offer stress glucocorticoid coverage, and that dynamic testing may also be considered; and that some patients may develop glucocorticoid withdrawal symptoms and may benefit from gradual tapering rather than abrupt discontinuation.

### Treatment of Cushing's syndrome: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^1128D1oo]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2015). Medium credibility.

Treatment goals for Cushing's syndrome — recommendations: In patients with overt CS, we recommend normalizing cortisol levels or action at its receptors to eliminate the signs and symptoms of CS and treating comorbidities associated with hypercortisolism. We recommend against treatment to reduce cortisol levels or action if there is not an established diagnosis of CS. We suggest against treatments designed to normalize cortisol or its action when there is only borderline biochemical abnormality of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis without any specific signs of CS, and the benefit of treating to normalize cortisol is not established in this setting.

### The diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^114FWJtw]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2008). Medium credibility.

Remarks for all tests state that in patients with a high pretest probability of Cushing's syndrome, to expedite diagnosis, the physician may elect to perform two tests simultaneously, and because the hypercortisolism of Cushing's syndrome can be variable, we recommend that at least two measurements of urine or salivary cortisol be obtained. Assays differ widely in accuracy; results near the cutoff value on a single measurement often can be explained by assay variability, and upper limits of normal are much lower with HPLC or LC-MS/MS than in antibody-based assays, with urine cortisol values obtained using HPLC may be as low as 40% of the value measured by RIA. Because serum assays measure total cortisol, false-positive rates for the overnight DST are seen in 50% of women taking the oral contraceptive pill, and wherever possible, estrogen-containing drugs should be withdrawn for 6 wk before testing or retesting. If initial results are normal, the patient can be reassured and no further testing need be done; a recommendation to return in 6 months if symptoms progress ensures that evolving symptoms or new features will not be ignored.

### Diagnosis and treatment of primary adrenal insufficiency: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^112hy7cT]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). Medium credibility.

Primary adrenal insufficiency (PAI) — interim morning cortisol strategy when corticotropin stimulation is not feasible: We suggest using a morning cortisol < 140 nmol/L (5 μg/dL) in combination with ACTH as a preliminary test suggestive of adrenal insufficiency; this suggestion is only applicable in acute situations when waiting for the corticotropin stimulation would unnecessarily delay appropriate therapy and should not be used for community-based screening. In the absence of exogenous glucocorticoids, a basal cortisol < 140 nmol/L (5 μg/dL) drawn in the morning (6 to 10 AM) is suggestive of adrenal insufficiency, although the choice of a morning cortisol to rule out adrenal insufficiency with 100% sensitivity is controversial, with studies arguing levels from > 285 nmol/L (10.3 μg/dL) to > 480 nmol/L (17 μg/dL), and there is no evidence to support the use of random cortisol to rule out adrenal insufficiency. The cortisol of 140 nmol/L (5 μg/dL) is typically below or near the lower limit of normal (6 to 10 AM) in reference populations for assays in contemporary clinical laboratories: 113–131 nmol/L (4.1–4.7 μg/dL).

Endocrine Society guideline — central adrenal insufficiency diagnosis: We suggest measuring serum cortisol levels at 8–9 AM as the first-line test for diagnosing central adrenal insufficiency and we recommend against using a random cortisol level to diagnose AI. We suggest that a cortisol level < 3 μg/dL is indicative of AI and a cortisol level > 15 μg/dL likely excludes an AI diagnosis. We suggest performing a corticotropin stimulation test when morning cortisol values are between 3 and 15 μg/dL; peak cortisol levels < 18.1 μg/dL (500 nmol/L) at 30 or 60 minutes indicate AI. We suggest that clinicians perform biochemical testing for the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis at least 18–24 hours after the last hydrocortisone dose or longer for synthetic glucocorticoids.

Figure 1
Flow chart for GC replacement continuation according to the ESE/ES guidelines. Conversion factor for cortisol: 1 nmol/L = 0.036 µg/dL. GC, glucocorticoid. ES, Endocrine Society; ESE, European Society of Endocrinology.

We believe that option 1 proposed by the ESE/ES experts has significant limitations. The guidelines lack precise recommendations on how and when to monitor for clinical signs of adrenal insufficiency, and these signs — such as fatigue, nausea and muscle or joint pain — can overlap with symptoms of underlying rheumatic diseases, complicating the clinical assessment. In option 2, if the morning serum cortisol is > 300 nmol/L (> 10 µg/dL), GC therapy can be discontinued. Conversely, if the level is < 150 nmol/L (< 5 µg/dL), patients are likely to have persistent adrenal insufficiency, and GC replacement should be continued at a physiological dose, with reassessment after a few months (between 1 and 6 months). For serum cortisol levels between 150 and 300 nmol/L (5 and 10 µg/dL, respectively), HPA axis recovery is possible but uncertain. In such cases, the experts recommend continuing GC replacement at a physiological dose, with a repeat morning serum cortisol measurement after a few weeks until recovery occurs. The ESE/ES experts propose that waking salivary cortisone or cortisol may represent a promising alternative to serum cortisol, offering the advantage of home-based sampling. It is important to emphasise that caution should be exercised when applying such an algorithm based on cortisol levels in biological samples, due to the variability inherent in different assay methods.

If there are clinical concerns, options are to move to Scenario 2 or temporarily increase the glucocorticoid dose and taper down over a longer period.

### Adrenal insufficiency in adults: a review [^111cmN7E]. JAMA (2025). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Adrenal insufficiency is a syndrome of cortisol deficiency and is categorized as primary, secondary, or glucocorticoid induced. Although primary and secondary adrenal insufficiency are rare, affecting less than 279 per 1 million individuals, glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency is common.

Observations

Primary adrenal insufficiency, which involves deficiency of all adrenocortical hormones, is caused by autoimmune destruction, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, pharmacological inhibition (eg, high doses of azole antifungal therapy), infection (eg, tuberculosis, fungal infections), or surgical removal of adrenal cortical tissue. Secondary adrenal insufficiency is caused by disorders affecting the pituitary gland, such as tumors, hemorrhage, inflammatory or infiltrative conditions (eg, hypophysitis, sarcoidosis, hemochromatosis), surgery, radiation therapy, or medications that suppress corticotropin production, such as opioids. Glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency is caused by administration of supraphysiological doses of glucocorticoids. Patients with adrenal insufficiency typically present with nonspecific symptoms, including fatigue (50%-95%), nausea and vomiting (20%-62%), and anorexia and weight loss (43%-73%). Glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency should be suspected in patients who have recently tapered or discontinued a supraphysiological dose of glucocorticoids. Early-morning (approximately 8 am) measurements of serum cortisol, corticotropin, and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) are used to diagnose adrenal insufficiency. Primary adrenal insufficiency is typically characterized by low morning cortisol levels (< 5 µg/dL), high corticotropin levels, and low DHEAS levels. Patients with secondary and glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency typically have low or intermediate morning cortisol levels (5–10 µg/dL) and low or low-normal corticotropin and DHEAS levels. Patients with intermediate early-morning cortisol levels should undergo repeat early-morning cortisol testing or corticotropin stimulation testing (measurement of cortisol before and 60 minutes after administration of cosyntropin, 250 µg). Treatment of adrenal insufficiency involves supplemental glucocorticoids (eg, hydrocortisone, 15–25 mg daily, or prednisone, 3–5 mg daily). Mineralocorticoids (eg, fludrocortisone, 0.05–0.3 mg daily) should be added for patients with primary adrenal insufficiency. Adrenal crisis, a syndrome that can cause hypotension and shock, hyponatremia, altered mental status, and death if untreated, can occur in patients with adrenal insufficiency who have inadequate glucocorticoid therapy, acute illness, and physical stress. Therefore, all patients with adrenal insufficiency should be instructed how to increase glucocorticoids during acute illness and prescribed injectable glucocorticoids (eg, hydrocortisone, 100 mg intramuscular injection) to prevent or treat adrenal crisis.

Conclusions and Relevance

Although primary and secondary adrenal insufficiency are rare, glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency is a common condition. Diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency involves early-morning measurement of cortisol, corticotropin, and DHEAS. All patients with adrenal insufficiency should be treated with glucocorticoids and instructed how to prevent and treat adrenal crisis.

Recurrence monitoring in Cushing disease — Recurrence is a more significant problem in adults, with one study reporting that after initial remission, 23% of adults with microadenomas and 33% with macroadenomas had recurrence, and overall recurrence rates vary from 15–66% within 5–10 years of initially successful surgery. Clinicians should evaluate patients for possible CD recurrence when the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis recovers, and then annually, or sooner if they have clinical symptoms; early recovery (within 6 mo) of HPA axis function may indicate an increased risk of recurrence. Elevated late-night serum/salivary cortisol is one of the earliest biochemically detectable signs of recurrence and almost always precedes elevated urine cortisol, and because diagnostic accuracy of proposed predictors is not high enough regarding long-term outcomes, clinicians must monitor every patient in remission from CD for the possibility of recurrence. Rarely, residual adrenocortical tissue can regrow due to prolonged adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) hypersecretion; if patients become cushinoid after bilateral adrenalectomy, clinicians should test endogenous cortisol secretory capacity by withholding glucocorticoid for 24 hours and checking serum/salivary cortisol levels; recurrence after ectopic ACTH-secreting tumor resection generally reflects metastasis.

Clinical practice points — adrenal insufficiency (AI) with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs): Primary AI can present with adrenal crisis and electrolyte abnormalities, and distinguishing primary from secondary AI guides mineralocorticoid use; testing adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), aldosterone, and renin is helpful. A low morning cortisol may be diagnostic at "3 to 4 ug/dL", and an elevated ACTH can confirm primary AI, though exogenous steroids or concomitant secondary AI must be considered if levels are equivocal. Patients should receive education on stress dosing and be treated with higher parenteral doses during major procedures or acute hospitalization.

Adrenal Insufficiency

Screening for Adrenal Insufficiency

Recommendations

All boys and men, but not girls and women, should be routinely screened for adrenal insufficiency with early morning cortisol and adrenocorticotropin hormone (ACTH) measurements.
Screening for adrenal insufficiency should be initiated in the first 6 months of life. Then, patients should be screened every 3–6 months before the age of 10 years and yearly thereafter. Screening should be performed parallel to MRI where possible.
All patients in whom symptoms suggestive of adrenal insufficiency manifest should undergo prompt evaluation for adrenal insufficiency to identify and prevent an adrenal crisis. If the patient is in crisis, a random cortisol and ACTH level measurement is sufficient (provided that serum specimens are drawn before glucocorticoid administration); if mildly symptomatic, early morning fasted cortisol and ACTH measurement is preferred.
All patients who are screened for adrenal insufficiency, or after diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency, should also be screened for mineralocorticoid deficiency with plasma renin and serum electrolytes.
All patients in whom symptoms suggestive of mineralocorticoid deficiency manifest should undergo prompt evaluation with plasma renin and serum electrolytes.

Primary adrenal insufficiency is common in male patients with ALD, but rare in women.e28, e29 Screening in adult patients should continue irrespective of age because it is inexpensive, and early diagnosis offers a large potential health benefit.

Adrenal insufficiency is characterized by low or normal early morning cortisol levels with high levels of ACTH. For diagnosis, random cortisol and ACTH can be used when early morning measurement is not an option; however, when the results are ambiguous, patients should be retested with early morning fasted cortisol and ACTH. Synthetic ACTH stimulation testing can be restricted to ambiguous cases or when early morning fasted cortisol and ACTH are difficult to obtain. Besides glucocorticoid deficiency, some patients also develop mineralocorticoid deficiency (hypoaldosteronism).e30, e31

Treatment of Adrenal Insufficiency

Recommendations

If adrenal insufficiency is present, we recommend glucocorticoid replacement therapy by an endocrinologist.
Mineralocorticoid replacement therapy should not be initiated based on symptoms alone but should also take into account plasma renin and serum electrolyte abnormalities.
Routine evaluation of bone health with dual energy x-ray absorptiometry measurements in boys with adrenal insufficiency and glucocorticoid replacement therapy is not recommended.
No consensus was reached on the evaluation of bone health in men.

Patients with ambiguous results such as abnormal ACTH with normal or borderline cortisol values on stimulation testing should be managed per existing guidelines. e30, e31 Long-term glucocorticoid replacement therapy has been associated with impaired bone health. e32

(Good clinical practice) R 1.3 — We recommend that patients on glucocorticoid therapy have access to current up-to-date and appropriate information about different endocrine aspects of glucocorticoid therapy. (Good clinical practice)
2. Recommendations regarding taper of systemic glucocorticoid therapy for non-endocrine conditions, diagnosis and approach to glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency, and glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome R 2.1 — We suggest not to taper glucocorticoids in patients on short-term glucocorticoid therapy of < 3–4 weeks, irrespective of the dose. In these cases, glucocorticoids can be stopped without testing due to low concern for HPA axis suppression. (⊕○○○) R 2.2 — Glucocorticoid taper for patients on long-term glucocorticoid therapy should only be attempted if the underlying disease for which glucocorticoids were prescribed is controlled, and glucocorticoids are no longer required. In these cases, glucocorticoids are tapered until approaching the physiologic daily dose equivalent is achieved (eg, 4–6 mg prednisone). (Good clinical practice) R 2.3 — We recommend consideration of glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome that may occur during glucocorticoid taper. When glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome is severe, glucocorticoid dose can be temporarily increased to the most recent one that was tolerated, and the duration of glucocorticoid taper could be increased. (Good clinical practice) R 2.4 — We recommend against routine testing for adrenal insufficiency in patients on supraphysiologic doses of glucocorticoids, or if they are still in need of glucocorticoid treatment for the underlying disease. (Good clinical practice) R 2.5 — We suggest that patients taking long-acting glucocorticoids (eg, dexamethasone or betamethasone) should be switched to shorter-acting glucocorticoids (eg, hydrocortisone or prednisone) when long-acting glucocorticoids are no longer needed. (⊕○○○) R 2.6 — We suggest that patients on a physiologic daily dose equivalent, and aiming to discontinue glucocorticoid therapy, either: 1. continue to gradually taper the glucocorticoid dose, while being monitored clinically for signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency, or 2. be tested with a morning serum cortisol. (⊕○○○) R 2.7 — If confirmation of recovery of the HPA axis is desired, we recommend morning serum cortisol as the first test. The value of morning serum cortisol should be considered as a continuum, with higher values more indicative of HPA axis recovery. (⊕○○○) As a guide: 1.000000000000000e+00 we suggest that the test indicates recovery of the HPA axis if cortisol is > 300 nmol/L or 10 μg/dL and glucocorticoids can be stopped safely; 2.000000000000000e+00 we suggest that if the result is between 150 nmol/L or 5 μg/dL and 300 nmol/L or 10 μg/dL, the physiologic glucocorticoid dose should be continued, and the morning cortisol repeated after an appropriate time period (usually weeks to months); 3.000000000000000e+00 we suggest that if the result is < 150 nmol/L or 5 μg/dL, the physiologic glucocorticoid dose should be continued, and the morning cortisol repeated after a few months. R 2.8 — We suggest against routinely performing a dynamic test for diagnosing adrenal insufficiency in patients tapering or stopping glucocorticoid therapy. (⊕○○○) R 2.9 — We suggest awareness of possible glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency in patients: 1.000000000000000e+00 with current or recent use of non-oral glucocorticoid formulations presenting with signs and symptoms indicative of adrenal insufficiency, or 2.000000000000000e+00 using multiple glucocorticoid formulations simultaneously, or 3.000000000000000e+00 using high-dose inhaled or topical glucocorticoids, or 4.000000000000000e+00 using inhaled or topical glucocorticoids for > 1 year, or 5.000000000000000e+00 who received intra-articular glucocorticoid injections in the previous 2 months, or 6.000000000000000e+00 receiving concomitant treatment with strong cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors. R 2.10 — We suggest that patients with current or previous glucocorticoid treatment presenting with signs and symptoms of exogenous Cushing syndrome are assumed to have glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency. (Good clinical practice) R 2.11 — We suggest that patients aiming to discontinue glucocorticoids, but without recovery of HPA axis in one year while on physiologic daily dose equivalent, should be evaluated by an endocrinology specialist. We suggest that patients on glucocorticoids and history of adrenal crisis should also be evaluated by an endocrinology specialist. (Good clinical practice) R 2.12 — We recommend against the use of fludrocortisone in patients with glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency.
3. Recommendations on diagnosis and therapy of adrenal crisis in patients with glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency R 3.1 — We recommend that patients with current or recent glucocorticoid use who did not undergo biochemical testing to rule out glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency should receive stress dose coverage when they are exposed to stress. (Good clinical practice) R3.1A — Oral glucocorticoids should be used in case of minor stress and when there are no signs of hemodynamic instability or prolonged vomiting or diarrhea. R3.1B — Parenteral glucocorticoids should be used in case of moderate to major stress, procedures under general or regional anesthesia, procedures requiring prolonged avoidance or inability of oral intake, or when there are signs of hemodynamic instability or prolonged vomiting or diarrhea. R 3.2 — We suggest that in patients with current or recent glucocorticoid use who did not undergo biochemical testing to rule out glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency and present with hemodynamic instability, vomiting, or diarrhea, the diagnosis of adrenal crisis should be considered irrespective of the glucocorticoid type, mode of administration, and dose; patients with suspected adrenal crisis should be treated with parenteral glucocorticoids and fluid resuscitation.

### Hormonal replacement in hypopituitarism in adults: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^111XaNxD]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). Medium credibility.

Central adrenal insufficiency — initial biochemical evaluation is as follows: We suggest measuring serum cortisol levels at 8–9 AM as the first-line test for diagnosing central AI. We recommend against using a random cortisol level to diagnose AI. We suggest that a cortisol level < 3 μg/dL is indicative of AI and a cortisol level > 15 μg/dL likely excludes an AI diagnosis. We suggest performing a corticotropin stimulation test when morning cortisol values are between 3 and 15 μg/dL to diagnose AI. Peak cortisol levels < 18.1 μg/dL (500 nmol/L) at 30 or 60 minutes indicate AI. We suggest that clinicians perform biochemical testing for the HPA axis at least 18–24 hours after the last HC dose or longer for synthetic GCs.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for Cushing's syndrome, more specifically with respect to endocrine follow-up, ES 2015 guidelines recommend to obtain a follow-up morning cortisol and/or perform an ACTH stimulation test to assess the recovery of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis in patients with at least one intact adrenal gland, assuming there are no contraindications. Discontinue corticosteroid when the response to these tests is normal.

### The diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency in the critically ill patient: does it really matter? [^117E9bXk]. Critical Care (2006). Low credibility.

The definition of what constitutes a 'normal' adrenal response to critical illness is unclear. Consequently, published studies have used a variety of biochemical criteria to define 'adrenal insufficiency'. These criteria have been based on the baseline cortisol level or the increment in cortisol following corticotropin administration. However, in critically ill patients there are a number of confounding factors that make interpretation of these tests difficult. Furthermore, in those patients who are most likely to benefit from treatment with low-dose glucocorticoids, there is no evidence that treatment should be based on adrenal function testing. In those patients in whom the diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency may be important, this diagnosis may best be made based on the free cortisol level or the total cortisol level stratified by serum albumin.

If dose ≥ 30 Gy; 8 AM cortisol Yearly, refer to endocrinology for further testing if level < 13 mcg/dL or < 365 nmol/L. History items include failure to thrive, anorexia, dehydration, hypoglycemia, lethargy, and unexplained hypotension with Yearly assessment. Counseling notes the need for corticosteroid replacement therapy and stress dosing and to obtain a medical alert bracelet or card. Potential considerations add: If dose > 30 Gy refer to endocrinologist for ongoing management, given risk of multiple hormone deficiencies; if endocrinology care is not readily available, screen as indicated, and refer to endocrinologist for thyroid hormone replacement. Additional information specifies that cortisol levels should be drawn as close as possible to 8AM and before 9 AM. System classification is SYSTEM = Endocrine/Metabolic SCORE = 1.

### European Society of Endocrinology and endocrine society joint clinical guideline: diagnosis and therapy of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency [^113uLZzA]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Once glucocorticoids are tapered down to physiologic replacement doses, the panel suggests two possible approaches for the discontinuation of glucocorticoid therapy (Fig. 2). Selecting one approach over the other might be driven by patient-related aspects including co-morbidities, co-medication, age and pre-test probability for adrenal insufficiency or by the medical context such as training and experience of the treating clinician or accessibility to laboratory diagnostics. There are no studies showing the superiority of any of these approaches in terms of clinical outcomes or cost-benefit.

Figure 2.
Proposed approach to systemic glucocorticoid discontinuation.

Patients may gradually taper glucocorticoids while being cautiously monitored for clinical manifestations of adrenal insufficiency. If the patient experiences signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency, glucocorticoid regimen should be restarted and not discontinued until recovery of HPA axis is documented. If the patient does not experience any symptoms, the tapering proceeds until glucocorticoid discontinuation.

Alternatively, patients may undergo testing with a morning serum cortisol (sample collected between 8:00 and 9:00) for the determination of HPA axis recovery (R 2.7). If adrenal insufficiency is documented, exogenous glucocorticoid should not be reduced below the lower end of physiologic replacement dose ranges to ensure adequate replacement for adrenal insufficiency, yet still providing a stimulus for HPA-axis recovery. Patients should be retested according to recommendations in 2.7. and further significant dose reduction should only occur with indication of HPA-axis recovery.

R 2.7 — If confirmation of recovery of the HPA axis is desired, we recommend morning serum cortisol as the first test. The value of morning serum cortisol should be considered as a continuum (Considering this continuum, suggested cut-offs in nmol/l and μg/dL are not exact conversions but have been rounded to improve clinical applicability in an international context.), with higher values more indicative of HPA axis recovery. (⊕○○○)

As a guide:

we suggest that the test indicates recovery of the HPA axis if cortisol is > 300 nmol/L or 10 μg/dL and glucocorticoids can be stopped safely;
we suggest that if the result is between 150 nmol/L or 5 μg/dL and 300 nmol/L or 10 μg/dL, the physiologic glucocorticoid dose should be continued, and the morning cortisol repeated after an appropriate time period (usually weeks to months);
we suggest that if the result is < 150 nmol/L or 5 μg/dL, the physiologic glucocorticoid dose should be continued, and the morning cortisol repeated after a few months.

### Do corticosteroids damage the brain? [^116pwyWX]. Journal of Neuroendocrinology (2006). Low credibility.

Corticosteroids are an essential component of the body's homeostatic system. In common with other such systems, this implies that corticosteroid levels in blood and, more importantly, in the tissues remain within an optimal range. It also implies that this range may vary according to circumstance. Lack of corticosteroids, such as untreated Addison's disease, can be fatal in humans. In this review, we are principally concerned with excess or disturbed patterns of circulating corticosteroids in the longer or shorter term, and the effects they have on the brain.

Glucocorticoids and estrogen — cortisol interpretation: We suggest that when clinicians assess adrenal reserve or the adequacy of HC replacement, they take into consideration that total serum cortisol level can be elevated due to the effects of estrogen on CBG; about 95% of circulating cortisol is bound mainly to CBG and to a lesser extent to albumin, and unbound cortisol is the active fraction, and oral estrogen therapy increases circulating CBG, leading to increased total cortisol levels, which does not occur with transdermal estrogen therapy.

Adrenal insufficiency can present with non-specific clinical features. Therefore, a single cortisol measurement is often included in the biochemical work-up of an unwell child. This article aims to review the diagnostic utility of a single cortisol measurement by outlining the physiological, clinical and technical factors affecting result interpretation. Clinical scenarios are used to illustrate how this test may be used in different commonly encountered situations in general paediatrics, with the aim of minimising the frequency of inconclusive results.

### Cortisol levels during acute illnesses in children and adolescents: a systematic review [^116PUM1Q]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Study Selection, Screening, and Eligibility Criteria

All search results were saved in electronic files, and abstracts were accessed online. Titles and abstracts were screened for eligibility criteria. A PRISMA flow diagram is shown in the eFigure in the Supplement.

The inclusion criteria for the studies were (1) acute illnesses commonly encountered during childhood and adolescence; (2) participants aged 1 month to 18 years; (3) basal plasma or serum cortisol levels in venous or arterial blood (but not after stimulation with synthetic corticotropin, corticotrophin-releasing hormone, or metyrapone), measured within 48 hours of presentation (irrespective of time of day because the diurnal pattern of cortisol secretion is lost during acute illness); and (4) blood cortisol values reported in the results. Studies that met these criteria were included independent of the primary aim of the study.

The following exclusion criteria were applied: (1) case reports or series of fewer than 5 participants; (2) participants younger than 1 month or older than 18 years; (3) participants known to have GC deficiency, adrenal insufficiency, or adrenal deficiency; (4) treatment with a systemic GC before the acute illness; (5) GC treatment given before blood was taken for measurement of cortisol levels; (6) other treatment with potential influence on cortisol levels (eg, etomidate); (7) cortisol or its metabolites measured in saliva or urine; and (8) blood cortisol metabolites (eg, 17-hydroxycorticosteroid) measured. Two reviewers (M.R. and M.C.) independently read the abstracts and used these criteria to screen for study eligibility. Thereafter, the full text of each study was read to classify it as relevant or not relevant. Differences were resolved by joint review and discussion of the study.

7 Drug Interactions

7.1 Drug Effects on Plasma Cortisol Levels

Accuracy of the test results can be affected by concomitant medications. Plasma cortisol levels and subsequent diagnosis of adrenocortical insufficiency following CORTROSYN administration may be inaccurate if patients are on certain medications because of their effect on cortisol or cortisol binding globulin levels [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) and Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].
Glucocorticoids and spironolactone: May falsely elevate plasma cortisol levels. Stop these drugs on the day of CORTROSYN testing. Long-acting glucocorticoids may need to be stopped for a longer period before CORTROSYN testing.
Estrogen: May elevate plasma total cortisol levels. Stop estrogen containing drugs 4 to 6 weeks before CORTROSYN testing to allow cortisol binding globulin levels to return to levels within the reference range. Alternatively, concomitant measurement of cortisol binding globulin at the time of testing can be done; if cortisol binding globulin levels are elevated, plasma total cortisol levels are considered inaccurate.

Drug effects on plasma cortisol levels:

◦ Accuracy of the test results can be affected by concomitant medications.◦ Glucocorticoids and spironolactone: May falsely elevate plasma cortisol levels. Stop these drugs on day of CORTROSYN testing. Long-acting glucocorticoids may need to be stopped for a longer period before CORTROSYN testing. (7)◦ Estrogen: May elevate plasma total cortisol levels. Stop estrogen containing drugs 4 to 6 weeks before CORTROSYN testing. (7)

Glucocorticoid replacement and hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis recovery — We recommend glucocorticoid replacement with hydrocortisone, 10–12 mg/m²/d in divided doses, either twice or thrice daily, with the first dose taken as soon as possible after waking; although some practitioners prescribe supraphysiological doses (eg, hydrocortisone 20 mg two to three times daily) in the immediate postoperative period, there are no controlled studies that address whether this minimizes glucocorticoid withdrawal, and clinicians can assess HPA axis recovery with a morning cortisol obtained every 3 months, initiating ACTH stimulation testing when the level is 7.4 μg/dL (200 nmol/L) or more, considering the axis recovered if the baseline or stimulated level is approximately 18 μg/dL (500 nmol/L) or greater, while patients with cortisol levels below 5 μg/dL (138 nmol/L) should remain on glucocorticoids until retested in 3–6 months.

### What is the best approach to tailoring hydrocortisone dose to meet patient needs in 2012? [^112zKy3X]. Clinical Endocrinology (2013). Low credibility.

Cortisol is an essential stress hormone and replacement with oral hydrocortisone is lifesaving in patients with adrenal insufficiency. Cortisol has a diurnal rhythm regulated by the central body clock and this rhythm is a metabolic signal for peripheral tissue clocks. Loss of cortisol rhythmicity is associated with fatigue, depression and insulin resistance. A general principle in endocrinology is to replace hormones to replicate physiological concentrations; however, the pharmacokinetics of oral immediate-release hydrocortisone make it impossible to fully mimic the cortisol rhythm and patients still have an increased morbidity and mortality despite replacement. Traditionally, physicians have replaced hydrocortisone with a total daily dose based on the diurnal 24-h cortisol production rate with hydrocortisone given twice or thrice daily, with the highest dose first thing in the morning. Monitoring treatment and dose titration has been much debated with some clinicians using cortisol day curves and others relying on clinical symptoms. The main challenge is that there is no established biomarker of cortisol activity. In addressing the clinical question, we have taken the view that an understanding of the cortisol circadian rhythm and hydrocortisone pharmacokinetics is essential when tailoring hydrocortisone dose. Using this approach, we have developed a thrice daily, weight-related, dosing regimen and a pharmacokinetic and clinical method to monitor treatment. Our argument for replicating the cortisol circadian rhythm is based on the observation that disruption of the rhythm is associated with ill health, and the few studies that have compared different treatment regimens. Further studies are required to definitively test the benefits of replacing the cortisol circadian rhythm in patients with adrenal insufficiency.

### The diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^113yNRnH]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective of the study was to develop clinical practice guidelines for the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome.

Participants

The Task Force included a chair, selected by the Clinical Guidelines Subcommittee (CGS) of The Endocrine Society, five additional experts, a methodologist, and a medical writer. The Task Force received no corporate funding or remuneration.

Consensus Process

Consensus was guided by systematic reviews of evidence and discussions. The guidelines were reviewed and approved sequentially by The Endocrine Society's CGS and Clinical Affairs Core Committee, members responding to a web posting, and The Endocrine Society Council. At each stage the Task Force incorporated needed changes in response to written comments.

Conclusions

After excluding exogenous glucocorticoid use, we recommend testing for Cushing's syndrome in patients with multiple and progressive features compatible with the syndrome, particularly those with a high discriminatory value, and patients with adrenal incidentaloma. We recommend initial use of one test with high diagnostic accuracy (urine cortisol, late night salivary cortisol, 1 mg overnight or 2 mg 48-h dexamethasone suppression test). We recommend that patients with an abnormal result see an endocrinologist and undergo a second test, either one of the above or, in some cases, a serum midnight cortisol or dexamethasone-CRH test. Patients with concordant abnormal results should undergo testing for the cause of Cushing's syndrome. Patients with concordant normal results should not undergo further evaluation. We recommend additional testing in patients with discordant results, normal responses suspected of cyclic hypercortisolism, or initially normal responses who accumulate additional features over time.

Background

Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have revolutionized cancer treatment over the past decade. However, despite their increasing use in clinical practice, there are few established, evidence-based guidelines for the screening, diagnosis, and management of immune-related adverse events, particularly with regard to autoimmune endocrinopathies [1,2]. In particular, adrenal insufficiency is a toxicity associated with ICIs that is poorly characterized due to the nonspecific nature of its presentation, and can be life-threatening if not promptly recognized and treated [3]. Our aim is to better define the clinical, biochemical, and imaging features of ICI-related adrenal insufficiency (AI) to mediate earlier recognition and treatment.

Methods

We identified a total of 250 patients treated with either nivolumab, pembrolizumab, or ipilimumab/nivolumab combination therapy found to have a random cortisol level less than 3 or morning cortisol less than 5 during or following therapy. Of these, 60 patients had been on prednisone or dexamethasone at time of cortisol testing, and 6 had undergone adrenalectomy. These patients were excluded.

Results

184 patients met criteria for new onset AI on ICI therapy. Median time to onset was 17 weeks. 13% were appropriately diagnosed with adrenal insufficiency, 6% had subsequent workup with ACTH, 11% were treated with hydrocortisone, 2% were referred to endocrine. Of the undiagnosed patients, 5% had biochemical and clinical findings suggestive of adrenal insufficiency, including fatigue, nausea, hyponatremia, hypotension, and hyperkalemia, that was not further worked up in the setting of pembrolizumab and 10% in the setting of nivolumab. No anti-21 hydroxylase antibodies were drawn.

Conclusions

As ICIs are being used with increasing frequency, it is crucial for health care providers to recognize the characteristics of immune-mediated adrenal insufficiency and initiate the appropriate workup, treatment, and referrals. Based on our preliminary findings, we have found that a majority of cortisol levels are ordered as part of routine screening of ICI infusion but without proper work-up or follow up when levels meet criteria for AI. Few patients receive ACTH or antibody testing and are initiated on adrenal replacement or referred to endocrinology. Thus, we recommend a greater awareness and more systematic approach to diagnosing and managing AI in patients on ICIs.

### Diagnosis and treatment of primary adrenal insufficiency: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^1152153f]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). Medium credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for primary adrenal insufficiency, more specifically with respect to corticotropin stimulation test, ES 2016 guidelines recommend to consider using the standard dose test over other existing tests (250 mcg for adults and children ≥ 2 years of age, 15 mcg/kg for infants, and 125 mcg for other children < 2 years of age). Peak cortisol levels below 500 nmol/L (18 mcg/dL) at 30 or 60 minutes indicate adrenal insufficiency.

Midnight serum cortisol test logistics and pediatric considerations: The sleeping midnight cortisol requires inpatient admission for a period of 48 h or longer, and if a sleeping value is desired the blood sample must be drawn within 5–10 min of waking the patient, or through an indwelling line, to avoid false-positive results; young children may have their cortisol nadir earlier than midnight, and in children, precatheterization is essential so that a sleeping sample for serum cortisol can be obtained.

For serum cortisol measured by LC-MS/MS, a value > 327 nmol/L (> 11.8 μg/dL) resulted in a sensitivity of 98% and a negative predictive value of 99% for excluding glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency, and a value < 152 nmol/L (< 5.5 μg/dL) resulted in a specificity of 98% and a positive predictive value of 99% for confirming glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency.

The quality of evidence was moderate due to applicability concerns and the numbers were too small to draw firm conclusions on the value of morning cortisol as stand-alone test to diagnose glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency. Importantly, test results of both serum cortisol and 250 µg ACTH(1–24)-test were not related to clinical endpoints such as adrenal crisis.

Primary adrenal insufficiency — corticotropin test recommendation and performance state that 2.2 We suggest the low-dose (1 μg) corticotropin test for diagnosis of PAI only when the substance itself is in short supply. (2|⊕⊕○○); evidence notes that the stimulated increase of cortisol after 30 or 60 minutes in healthy individuals is comparable for both low-dose (1 μg) and high-dose (250 μg) corticotropin tests, resulting in a lower cutoff threshold (mean −2SD) of 500 nmol/L (18 μg/dL), that stimulated serum cortisol concentrations differ considerably at 60 minutes between both conditions, with a further rise in the high-dose test and a decrease of cortisol in the low-dose test, and that cosyntropin-stimulated cortisol levels are slightly higher at 60 vs 30 minutes although the 30-minute time point has been validated against the insulin tolerance test; overall, the low-dose and high-dose corticotropin stimulation tests yield comparable results in the diagnostic workup of PAI and the low-dose test adds no further sensitivity or specificity over the high-dose test.

Clinical Question III: What Is the Diagnostic Accuracy of a Morning Cortisol Value vs 250 μg ACTH (1–24)-test in Diagnosing Glucocorticoid-induced Adrenal Insufficiency?

Three studies were included. The GRADE evidence table is shown in Supplementary Table S7, and details of the studies are shown in Supplementary Table S8 (see section on Supplementary material). All studies assessed the diagnostic performance of a morning serum cortisol value vs 250 µg ACTH (1–24)-test. Of note, in the studies of Sagar et al and Sbardella et al ACTH (1–24) was administered intramuscularly or intravenously, and results could not be stratified for intravenous ACTH (1–24) only. Both studies measured cortisol by immunoassay. In the study by Sagar et al, 100% of patients with morning cortisol < 100 nmol/L (< 3.6 μg/dL) failed ACTH (1–24)-test, while all patients with morning cortisol > 350 nmol/L (> 12.6 μg/dL) passed ACTH (1–24)-test (see Supplementary Table S8 for cut-off values for ACTH (1–24)-testing in included studies). The results of the study by Sbardella et al showed that morning cortisol ≥ 336 nmol/L (≥ 12.1 μg/dL) had a specificity of 100% for predicting a normal ACTH (1–24)-test, and morning cortisol ≤ 124 nmol/L (≤ 4.5 μg/dL) was 100% sensitive for predicting failure. Positive and negative predictive values were not reported. Debono et al found that a baseline serum cortisol > 310 nmol/L (> 11.2 μg/dL) measured by immunoassay excluded glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency with a sensitivity of 98% and a negative predictive value of 97% (data retrieved after contacting the authors). A baseline serum cortisol < 152 nmol/L (< 5.5 μg/dL) confirmed glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency with a specificity of 97% and a positive predictive value of 95%.

Central adrenal insufficiency — diagnostic testing and cortisol cutoff: Clinicians can assess central adrenal insufficiency (AI) using insulin tolerance and low-dose and standard-dose ACTH stimulation tests, but limitations include interpreting test cutoff values and thresholds required for glucocorticoid (GC) replacement; although assays have evolved, cortisol levels < 18.1 μg/dL (500 nmol/L) poststimulation are indicative of AI.

### Diagnosis and treatment of primary adrenal insufficiency: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^113nCdi6]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). Medium credibility.

Primary adrenal insufficiency (PAI) — initial biochemical diagnosis and confirmation: DHEAS levels well below age- and sex-adjusted norms are described as a useful initial sign but cannot be used alone. The diagnosis is highly likely when cortisol is < 140 nmol/L (5 μg/dL) together with plasma ACTH more than 2-fold above the assay upper reference limit, and an ACTH value > 66 pmol/L represents a maximum stimulus for cortisol secretion. For confirmation, a corticotropin stimulation test should be performed in most cases unless basal results are absolutely unequivocal.

### Screening and diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome [^116TS5T7]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

Screening studies in high-risk populations have suggested that Cushing's syndrome is more common than previously appreciated. Patients who have specific signs and symptoms or clinical diagnoses known to be associated with hypercortisolism should be considered for screening. The measurement of late-night salivary cortisol provides the most sensitive method for screening, and urine-free cortisol and low-dose dexamethasone suppression testing may be used for confirmation of the diagnosis of endogenous hypercortisolism

### Diagnosis and treatment of primary adrenal insufficiency: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^111eiSKe]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). Medium credibility.

Primary adrenal insufficiency (PAI) — plasma ACTH for diagnosis: We recommend measurement of plasma ACTH to establish PAI, and in patients with confirmed cortisol deficiency a plasma ACTH > 2-fold the upper limit of the reference range is consistent with PAI. A plasma ACTH concentration exceeding 300 ng/L (66 pmol/L) provides maximum stimulation of glucocorticoid synthesis, and a low cortisol concentration (< 140 nmol/L [< 5 μg/dL]) found in combination with an elevated concentration of ACTH indicates the inability of the adrenal cortex to respond to ACTH stimulation and is highly predictive for PAI. Thus, we have recommended the 2 × the upper limit of the reference interval, but in some cases of PAI it would be only above the quoted reference interval but not > 2 × the upper limit of the reference interval.

Diagnostic evaluation in suspected 21-hydroxylase deficiency (21OHD) emphasizes cosyntropin stimulation testing when basal results are inconclusive, using a pharmacological dose of 0.25 mg given intravenously (reduced to 0.125 mg in very low birth weight infants) with samples at baseline and 60 minutes; tests should be deferred until after the first 24 to 48 hours of life, and screening in symptomatic individuals past infancy uses LC–MS/MS serum samples obtained prior to 8 am, with menstruating females sampled in the early follicular phase. At minimum, cortisol and 17OHP should be measured, and cosyntropin stimulation is needed for indeterminate baseline 17OHP levels.

### How should we interrogate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis in patients with suspected hypopituitarism? [^113AsZ6c]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2016). Low credibility.

Clinical context

ACTH deficiency can be congenital or acquired due to structural or functional diseases of the pituitary or hypothalamus. It can occur in isolation or as part of more widespread pituitary failure. The most common cause of ACTH deficiency is ACTH suppression and subsequent adrenal atrophy due to chronic glucocorticoid use. Other causes are outlined in Table 1.

Table 1
Causes of central hypoadrenalism

Interrogation of the hypothalamic pituitary axis may be required acutely or in a more routine setting. The clinical scenario can mandate which test is performed. For example a random cortisol and ACTH level may be adequate in making a diagnosis in an acutely ill patient with a suspected adrenal crisis e.g. pituitary apoplexy. In other situations a low morning cortisol level in an at risk patient may also be sufficient in diagnosing ACTH/cortisol deficiency. Often however, dynamic assessment of cortisol reserves is needed (see below).

In hypopituitarism, there is generally a specific sequential failure of pituitary hormones with GH being the most common pituitary hormone affected followed by gonadotrophins and culminating in loss of ACTH and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). ACTH however can be the first or only pituitary hormone affected in certain situations such as lymphocytic hypophysitis or suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis by exogenous glucocorticoids.

Detection and treatment of central hypoadrenalism is important as it has been shown to be associated with increased morbidity and mortality.

Testing for central hypoadrenalism

Interrogation of the HPA axis is performed as part of a formal screening process for hypopituitarism in patients with organic hypothalamic-pituitary disease such as those with sellar/parasellar tumours, post pituitary surgery or apoplexy, history of cranial irradiation or traumatic brain injury. In other situations the assessment may be triggered by suggestive symptoms such as fatigue, unexplained weight loss, spontaneous hypoglycaemia or hyponatraemia.

Timing of assessment

ACTH suppression from exogenous steroids

ACTH suppression and subsequent cortisol deficiency can result from chronic glucocorticoid use, can be unpredictable regardless of dose and duration of glucocorticoid and recovery can take weeks to years. Patients on long-term glucocorticoids for inflammatory conditions are frequently referred to specialist endocrine services for assessment of possible ACTH suppression. As prednisone can cross-react with the cortisol assay we suggest waiting until the patient is tapered to a dose of 5 mg at which point they are switched to an equivalent dose hydrocortisone 10 mg twice daily and a dynamic test can be carried out with the dose held the afternoon before and morning of the test.

### Plasma, salivary and urinary cortisol levels following physiological and stress doses of hydrocortisone in normal volunteers [^1157R9jn]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2014). Low credibility.

Conclusions

We confirm that a morning dose of hydrocortisone 20 mg is supraphysiological and excessive for routine maintenance. It results in very high free cortisol concentrations which lead to increased urinary cortisol excretion. The measurement of plasma, salivary or urinary cortisol at 2 h after an oral dose gives a good indication of peak cortisol concentrations, but further research defining optimal targets for salivary cortisol and urinary cortisol:creatinine ratio following true physiological hydrocortisone replacement are required before recommending these measures in clinical practice. An intravenous bolus of hydrocortisone 50 mg achieved very high cortisol levels within 30 minutes of administration. The routine biochemical monitoring of stress glucocorticoid supplementation therapy is not recommended, but the measurement of trough levels at 5–6 h may identify a minority of patients who require more frequent intravenous dosing.

2.5 Administration Information

CORTROSYN may be administered by intramuscular or intravenous injection.

Obtain blood sample for baseline serum cortisol. Obtain blood samples again for assessment of cortisol levels exactly 30 minutes and 60 minutes after administration of CORTROSYN.

2.6 Interpretation of Plasma Cortisol Levels after CORTROSYN Injection

Stimulated plasma cortisol levels of less than 18 mcg/dL at 30- or 60-minutes post CORTROSYN injection are suggestive of adrenocortical insufficiency. Cutoff values for exclusion of adrenocortical insufficiency may vary according to the assay used. Test results can be affected by concomitant medications and certain medical conditions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

In general, stop glucocorticoids and spironolactone on the day of CORTROSYN testing. For long-acting glucocorticoids, stop for a longer period before CORTROSYN testing. (2.1)
For adults, the recommended dose is 0.25 mg to be administered by intravenous or intramuscular injection. (2.2)
For pediatric patients, the recommended dose to be administered by intravenous or intramuscular injection is (2.3):

◦ 0.125 mg for patients birth to less than 2 years of age

### The role of cortisol in PTSD among women exposed to a trauma-related stressor [^113xH2HF]. Journal of Anxiety Disorders (2012). Low credibility.

Research linking post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) to hypercortisolism in laboratory experiments was extended to a natural clinical setting. Mothers of children diagnosed with a life-threatening illness (N = 92) completed standardized measures of PTSD and provided a salivary cortisol sample during their child's medical check-up (Time 1) and again 24h later, after the threat of possible negative medical reports was removed (Time 2). Women who met diagnostic criteria for PTSD exhibited significantly higher cortisol levels at Time 1 compared to women who did not meet criteria for a diagnosis. No significant differences were observed for cortisol levels at Time 2 between the women with and without PTSD. These findings extend current laboratory findings linking hypercortisolism and PTSD to a natural, stressful situation. Implications for understanding the etiology of PTSD as well as for possible prevention and intervention options are discussed.

In case of suspected overdosage, ISTURISA should be temporarily discontinued, cortisol levels should be checked, and if necessary, corticosteroid supplementation should be initiated. Close surveillance may be necessary, including monitoring of the QT interval, blood pressure, glucose, fluid, and electrolyte until the patient's condition is stable.

### Should patients with phosphomannomutase 2-CDG (PMM2-CDG) be screened for adrenal insufficiency? [^113eDyBZ]. Molecular Genetics and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

PMM2-CDG is the most common congenital disorder of glycosylation (CDG) accounting for almost 65% of known CDG cases affecting N-glycosylation. Abnormalities in N-glycosylation could have a negative impact on many endocrine axes. There is very little known on the effect of impaired N-glycosylation on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis function and whether CDG patients are at risk of secondary adrenal insufficiency and decreased adrenal cortisol production. Cortisol and ACTH concentrations were simultaneously measured between 7:44 am to 1 pm in forty-three subjects (20 female, median age 12.8 years, range 0.1 to 48.6 years) participating in an ongoing international, multi-center Natural History study for PMM2-CDG (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03173300). Of the 43 subjects, 11 (25.6%) had cortisol below 5 μg/dl and low to normal ACTH levels, suggestive of secondary adrenal insufficiency. Two of the 11 subjects have confirmed central adrenal insufficiency and are on hydrocortisone replacement and/or stress dosing during illness; 3 had normal and 1 had subnormal cortisol response to ACTH low-dose stimulation test but has not yet been started on therapy; the remaining 5 have upcoming stimulation testing planned. Our findings suggest that patients with PMM2-CDG may be at risk for adrenal insufficiency. Monitoring of morning cortisol and ACTH levels should be part of the standard care in patients with PMM2-CDG.

Results of the Systematic Reviews

Clinical Questions, Eligibility Criteria, and Definition of Endpoints

At the start of the guideline process, the working group formulated clinical questions regarding evaluation of adrenal function and treatment of patients after long-term supraphysiologic glucocorticoid exposure. The clinical questions that formed the basis for the systematic reviews are summarized in Supplementary Table S2 (see section on Supplementary Material).

Eligible articles were required to present data on adult patients (≥ 18 years). Articles presenting data on glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency based on biochemical testing were included based on the use of the high-dose (250 μg) short ACTH (1–24)-test (also referred by brand names as Synacthen or cosyntropin test), since these tests are widely used in clinical practice. During this test, 250 μg of synthetic ACTH (ACTH (1–24), or another corticotropic agent), is administered intravenously. To determine adrenal response to synthetic ACTH, serum cortisol levels are measured 30 and 60 minutes after administration. In primary and secondary adrenal insufficiency, peak cortisol levels < 500 nmol/L (< 18.1 μg/dL), depending on assay, are indicative of adrenal insufficiency. Since the population under study was assessed for glucocorticoid insufficiency, the definition of a positive test was based on cut-off values provided in the individual articles. For clinical question I (incidence and predictors of recovery of HPA axis function in patients with glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency), the number of persons with recovery of HPA axis at re-testing (numerator) and the total number of persons with glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency tested at baseline (denominator) were used to estimate the incidence of recovery.

We did not include case reports or case series, which are more prone to selection and publication bias; only studies reporting a population of ten or more patients were eligible. In case of multiple studies describing the same cohort, the study comprising the highest number of subjects was included. Eligible studies were restricted to languages familiar to the authors (English, French, German, Dutch and Spanish). Authors were contacted for clarification when reported data were not sufficient for accurate data extraction.

R 2.8 — We suggest against routinely performing a dynamic test for diagnosing adrenal insufficiency in patients tapering or stopping glucocorticoid therapy. (⊕○○○)

Rationale

Morning cortisol measurement can serve as a simple approach to HPA axis assessment, obviating the need for other tests in many patients (see recommendation 2.7). However, if cortisol remains indeterminate (see 2.7), dynamic testing can be considered. The decision to carry out dynamic testing should consider the test's availability, feasibility, costs and regional accessibility. There is no evidence that a specific test in the context of glucocorticoid treatment is superior. Dynamic testing options include 250 µg ACTH (1–24) and, less commonly, overnight metyrapone and insulin tolerance tests. The 250 µg ACTH (1–24) test only examines the direct response of the adrenal gland to supraphysiologic ACTH stimulation. In primary and secondary adrenal insufficiency, a peak cortisol level < 500 nmol/L (< 18.1 μg/dL), depending on assay, at 30 or 60 minutes is indicative of adrenal insufficiency. As suppression of the HPA axis subsequently results in adrenocortical atrophy with impaired cortisol response, the test may yield less reliable results in patients on shorter duration of glucocorticoid therapy. The overnight metyrapone stimulation test and insulin tolerance test are more labor-intensive and can be associated with significant adverse effects. They assess the entire HPA axis, but head-to-head studies comparing different dynamic tests in this patient population are lacking. Furthermore, most of the published studies using dynamic testing to diagnose glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency rely on ACTH (1–24) stimulation. The panel suggests against the use of the 1 µg ACTH (1–24) test since it does not provide better diagnostic accuracy than the standard 250 µg and there are no commercially available preparations of 1 µg ACTH (1–24). If dynamic testing is employed, it should be done after holding any glucocorticoid therapy for at least 24 hours to avoid interference in steroid measurements.

R 2.9 — We suggest awareness of possible glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency in patients: 1. with current or recent use of non-oral glucocorticoid formulations presenting with signs and symptoms indicative of adrenal insufficiency, or 2. using multiple glucocorticoid formulations simultaneously, or 3. using high dose inhaled or topical glucocorticoids, or 4. using inhaled or topical glucocorticoids for > 1 year, or 5. who received intra-articular glucocorticoid injections in the previous 2 months, or 6. receiving concomitant treatment with strong cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors.

### Screening for adrenal suppression in children with inflammatory bowel disease discontinuing glucocorticoid therapy [^1124G5ym]. BMC Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Conclusions

In conclusion, this study shows that at least every fifth paediatric IBD patient presents with abnormal or even undetectable serum cortisol values at the end of systemic glucocorticoid treatment. Without screening, however in many patients the condition goes unnoticed. For the patients with low levels of cortisol, hydrocortisone substitution was introduced until observing cortisol values within normal range. This practice reduces the risk of serious consequences of adrenal insufficiency and most likely improves the wellbeing of the patients. We recommend screening for adrenal insufficiency in children with IBD when the daily dose is low and/or the therapy is about to be discontinued to depict patients in need of hydrocortisone substitution.

How to Screen/Establishment of Hypercortisolism

If a patient is suspected of CS and exogenous glucocorticoid use is excluded, it is recommended to start by performing one of the first-line screening tests. Recommended initial tests include:

overnight 1-mg DST;
24-hour UFC; and
late-night salivary cortisol test (LNSC).

The latter 2 tests should be performed at least twice because of significant day-to-day variations in cortisol production. The pooled diagnostic accuracy of the various tests is presented in Figure 2. There is no specific order of screening, but the choice for a specific test can be made based on individual patient characteristics (see also caveats in Figure 2). A promising relatively novel test to detect chronic hypercortisolism is measurement of cortisol in scalp hair (see "New developments: potential of hair cortisol measurement as diagnostic tool").

### Diagnosis and management of adrenal insufficiency [^113FmDe1]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2015). Medium credibility.

Adrenal insufficiency continues to be a challenge for patients, their physicians, and researchers. During the past decade, long-term studies have shown increased mortality and morbidity and impaired quality of life in patients with adrenal insufficiency. These findings might, at least partially, be due to the failure of glucocorticoid replacement therapy to closely resemble physiological diurnal secretion of cortisol. The potential effect of newly developed glucocorticoid drugs is a focus of research, as are the mechanisms potentially underlying increased morbidity and mortality. Adrenal crisis remains a threat to lives, and awareness and preventative measures now receive increasing attention. Awareness should be raised in medical teams and patients about adrenal insufficiency and management of adrenal crisis to improve clinical outcome.

### Cushing's syndrome: rapid evidence review [^116NACQu]. American Family Physician (2024). Medium credibility.

Cushing's syndrome is a rare, multisystemic disease caused by chronic exposure to supraphysiologic levels of cortisol. Prolonged hypercortisolism is associated with significant multisystem morbidity and mortality and decreased quality of life. Diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome is often delayed by several years due to its insidiously progressive course, diverse clinical presentation, overlap of symptoms with many common conditions, and testing complexity. Exogenous glucocorticoid use must be excluded as the primary etiology. Excessive endogenous cortisol production can be caused by an overproduction of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) through pituitary tumors or ectopic sources (ACTH-dependent cases), or it can be caused by autonomous cortisol overproduction by the adrenal glands (ACTH-independent cases). The recommended diagnostic approach includes appropriate screening, confirmation of hypercortisolism, and determination of etiology. First-line treatment is surgical removal of the source of cortisol overproduction. Lifelong posttherapy monitoring is required to treat comorbidities and detect recurrence.

Consider measuring plasma metanephrine during adrenal venous sampling in patients with mild autonomous cortisol secretion to help lateralize both aldosterone and cortisol secretion; recognize the importance of measuring early morning cortisol following adrenal surgery and prepare for a period of possible glucocorticoid insufficiency.

### The role of peripheral cortisol levels in suicide behavior: a systematic review and meta-analysis of 30 studies [^114qrv1A]. Psychiatry Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Cortisol can be considered as one biomarker for diagnosis of suicide; nevertheless, several studies have shown conflicting results. This study aimed to evaluate the levels of cortisol in individuals with suicide behavior and controls (healthy or with other psychiatric disorders). Published articles were searched on online databases (PubMed, Scopus and EBSCO). Standardized mean differences (SMD), heterogeneity, publication bias and sensitivity were assessed using the Comprehensive Meta-Analysis (CMA) statistical software. The meta-analysis comprised 30 studies that provided 1775 cases, and 2162 controls (696 healthy individuals and 1465 individuals with other psychiatric diagnoses). The pooled results revealed that cortisol levels were higher in individuals with suicide behavior (SMD = 0.92, 95%CI = 0.26; 1.57, P = 0.006; I² = 88%, Q < 0.001) than healthy controls. However, individuals with suicide behavior showed decreased levels of cortisol in the morning. Additionally, individuals with suicide behavior showed lower levels of cortisol than psychiatric controls (SMD = -1.79, 95%CI = -3.01; -0.58, P = 0.004, I² = 89%, Q < 0.001). Morning cortisol levels in individuals with suicide behavior were higher than morning cortisol levels in psychiatric controls. Our updated meta-analysis suggests that peripheral levels of cortisol have a role in suicide behavior.

### Don't use serum cortisol levels as initial screening for adrenal… [^112p8EZp]. AAFP (2021). Medium credibility.

Serum cortisol levels do not provide high-end diagnostic accuracy or sensitivity when used as an initial diagnostic test. Late-night salivary cortisol samples employing an approved collection device, 24-hour urine-free cortisol, or a 1-mg overnight dexamethasone suppression test should be used as an initial test. These tests have a high diagnostic accuracy for Cushing syndrome. Multiple screening tests may need to be performed based on the variability of hypercortisolism in Cushing syndrome. Two measurements of abnormal cortisol levels with these tests are recommended for an initial diagnosis; further workup should be referred to an endocrinologist to make the final diagnosis. Each of these tests has different limitations and should be chosen based on the lifestyle and medical history of the patient. Patients with erratic sleep schedules or shift workers would not obtain accurate results from a late-night salivary cortisol test.

Women taking oral estrogen, those taking antiepileptic drugs, and pregnant women could have falsely elevated cortisol levels as CYP3A4 metabolizes dexamethasone with the dexamethasone suppression test. Urine-free cortisol tests require rigorous collection management and should not be used on patients experiencing renal failure, or those suspected to have mild Cushing syndrome. Exogenous glucocorticoid use must be excluded before performing these biochemical tests.

### The diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome… [^112kW4Ee]. JAMA Network (2000). Excellent credibility.

There are, in addition, some nonendocrine disorders that may have clinical and biochemical features suggestive of hypercortisolism. Various tests proposed in the last 3 decades have been extensively reviewed and their diagnostic accuracy carefully discussed. 2–12 Both urinary-free cortisol and the overnight dexamethasone suppression tests are suggested for screening hypercortisolism, whereas the 48-hour low-dose dexamethasone suppression test is usually used to confirm this hypersecretion. Three or more plasma samples during 24 hours are indicated to better identify cortisol hypersecretion. Because plasma cortisol concentrations in Cushing's syndrome are higher than in healthy persons, especially in the late evening, plasma samples should also be collected at that time.

Indeed, a retrospective study has suggested that a single plasma cortisol specimen taken at midnight during sleep can exclude Cushing's syndrome with a sensitivity of 100% in comparison with the 98% sensitivity of the LDDST examined in parallel. 68, 69 Nonetheless, the practical difficulties in performing this test in an ambulatory setting may prevent its widespread acceptance. The overnight 1-mg dexamethasone suppression test may exclude the presence of Cushing's syndrome when morning levels of plasma cortisol decrease to 138 nmol/L or less. It is the most frequently used screening test to rule out Cushing's syndrome and has a sensitivity greater than 98%. 9, 10, 70 The low-dose, 2-day, 2-mg dexamethasone suppression test is useful in confirming the diagnosis of hypercortisolism. A morning plasma cortisol level of 138 nmol/L or less after the patient has taken 8 doses of 0. 5 mg of dexamethasone, every 6 hours, indicates a normal response.

A reevaluation of this test revealed a sensitivity of 69% and specificity of 74% when standard criteria are used. 10 Owing to the practical difficulties in performing this test, it should be performed on hospitalized patients. Modifications of the dexamethasone test by administering the drug in terms of body weight and expression of urinary steroids in terms of grams of creatinine to improve accuracy have been proposed.

should be measured after a low or high dose of ACTH to unmask the relative cortisol deficiency. 6, 12–14 With that background of controversies in the published literature, the current study was performed to test the hypothesis that random levels or maximal increments of plasma cortisol may predict mortality independent of concurrent organ dysfunction or sex, and corticosteroid supplementation may decrease mortality in vasopressor-dependent critical illness. The design was an observational descriptive study conducted at a single tertiary care institution. The rationale for this particular dosage regimen was to avoid adverse effects from prolonged exposure to high doses of corticosteroids. None of the study patients received fludrocortisone supplementation. The mortality rates for women with either increments of 9 μg/dL or less or increments greater than 9 μg/dL were high.

Women with cortisol increments of 9 μg/dL or less had a median SOFA score of 9, and those with increments greater than 9 μg/dL had a median SOFA score of 8, at P = 0.2. Both women and men who had basal plasma cortisol levels of greater than 34 μg/dL and stimulated increments of 9 μg/dL or less had the highest mortality. Men who had basal plasma cortisol levels of 34 μg/dL or less and stimulated increments of greater than 9 μg/dL had the lowest mortality. However, random plasma cortisol levels below the thresholds reported in the literature as triggers for corticosteroid replacement were already associated with low mortality without corticosteroid supplementation. Bouachour et al6, 19 alluded to this contradiction when they described temporal variation of adrenal cortisol secretion during the course of a critical illness.

At an early phase, plasma cortisol levels were markedly elevated and then substantially decreased over the course of illness to variable levels, regardless of subsequent survival. Better clinical indicators should be employed to understand the relevancy of measured plasma cortisol levels in conjunction with the host hormonal milieu to avoid unwarranted corticosteroid supplementation. Clinical indicators from glucose metabolism, electrolyte balance, inflammation, organ recovery, and surrogate markers of hormonal feedback regulation would be superior markers to ascertain absolute cortisol deficiency. Manglik et al11 used serum electrolytes and glucose levels as an adjunct to measured plasma cortisol levels to confirm primary adrenal failure and to guide replacement therapy.
