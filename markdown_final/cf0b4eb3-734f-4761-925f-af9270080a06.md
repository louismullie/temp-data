## Question

What is capsaicin used for?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about what capsaicin is used for, including its approvals, mechanisms, and safety. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacology and mechanism that justify its clinical effects. Then, I should verify FDA-labeled indications and reconcile any labeling discrepancies. Next, I will review evidence across condition categories: neuropathic pain, musculoskeletal pain, pruritus, and respiratory applications. After that, I need to assess formulations, dosing, and route-specific considerations. I will then evaluate evidence quality and biases, confirm the safety profile and pharmacokinetics, and finally synthesize practical guidance on when and how to use capsaicin clinically, noting investigational versus established roles [^111C33vM] [^113GFono] [^1171GZMy].

> Let me first confirm the mechanistic basis. Capsaicin is a selective TRPV1 agonist on nociceptive fibers; activation produces initial excitation followed by "defunctionalization" with neuropeptide depletion, impaired axonal transport, loss of action potential generation, and a reversible reduction in intra-epidermal nerve fibers, which mechanistically explains sustained analgesia and antipruritic effects after topical exposure [^113UvSyf] [^117FM3mB] [^114t1Rvq]. Wait, let me verify metabolic claims: TRPV1 activation in the gut enhances GLP-1 secretion and improves glucose handling in mice, but these are preclinical and should not be over-extrapolated to human treatment decisions yet [^1129ued4] [^111ueixG].

> Now, I need to check labeled indications carefully. Qutenza (capsaicin 8% patch) is FDA-approved for peripheral neuropathic pain associated with postherpetic neuralgia, with application under medical supervision for 30–90 minutes, and guideline recommendations align with this use [^113GFono] [^116BjsJu] [^1171GZMy]. Hold on, I should verify topical low-dose labeling: some FDA SPL entries list 0.025% capsaicin for symptomatic relief of musculoskeletal pain and specify dosing every 6–8 hours, and one SPL explicitly states osteoarthritis dosing at 0.025% every 6–8 hours; yet another SPL frames osteoarthritis symptom relief as off-label, suggesting product-specific labeling variability — so I will present OA symptom relief as commonly included or permissible on some labels but acknowledge inconsistency across SPL documents [^115qczbk] [^111C33vM] [^116zRNPC].

> Next, I should review the highest-evidence neuropathic pain indication: postherpetic neuralgia (PHN). Randomized trials of the 8% patch (NGX-4010/Qutenza) demonstrate clinically meaningful pain reductions over 12 weeks after a single application, and AAFP guidelines explicitly recommend 8% patches for PHN with a 30–90 minute application time, with EFNS also supporting patch use in PHN while noting uncertainty about long-term sensory effects after repeated applications [^1171GZMy] [^117TV6kJ] [^113GFono] [^116GYKjW].

> I will now examine other neuropathic pain conditions. Wait, I initially thought US approval extended to HIV-associated neuropathy; but hold on, I should verify — trials and meta-analyses show efficacy in HIV-AN, yet the US label historically centered on PHN, so HIV-AN support is evidence-based but not a US-labeled indication, which I must clearly state [^115jxMLs] [^116BjsJu]. For diabetic peripheral neuropathy, I should confirm guideline positioning: AAFP 2024 recommends topical capsaicin as a second-line option after gabapentinoids, again indicating clinical support rather than primary first-line status in many care pathways [^111Zn41Z].

> Let me consider broader neuropathic etiologies. Observational cohorts and practice reviews report benefit of the 8% patch in postsurgical and post-traumatic neuropathic pain, and in some cases CRPS or trigeminal neuralgia, but these data are lower quality and should be framed as supportive rather than definitive; progressive benefit with repeat applications has been described, which can guide retreatment intervals pragmatically in partial responders [^112eCBoQ] [^112WZ4a7] [^112uTvqd].

> Turning to musculoskeletal pain, I should double-check the evidence hierarchy. Low-concentration topical creams (for example 0.025%) have evidence for osteoarthritis symptom relief, and network meta-analyses suggest capsaicin at licensed doses is superior to placebo and overall comparable to topical NSAIDs, though capsaicin evidence is fewer and at higher risk of bias; NASS also suggests short-term use of topical capsicum for low back pain up to three months [^1119rpsm] [^114zgaNk] [^115e2c9Y]. But wait, what about intra-articular capsaicin? Phase II trials of trans-capsaicin (CNTX-4975) show dose-dependent improvements in knee OA pain through 24 weeks for the 1.0 mg dose, yet this remains investigational and not standard of care, so I should present it cautiously as emerging therapy [^114DP5VK] [^116Nqxt2] [^111WNeCE].

> Next, I should review pruritus. The European S2k guideline supports topical capsaicin for localized chronic pruritus, aligning with its mechanism on small-fiber afferents; however, the British Association of Dermatologists recommends against topical capsaicin for generalized pruritus of unknown origin — so indication depends on pruritus phenotype and localization; niche uses such as pruritus ani have supportive case-level evidence, whereas vulvodynia guidelines recommend against capsaicin [^112cDbud] [^114Yoagz] [^116YvGNz] [^114s2DYf].

> I need to check respiratory applications. Intranasal capsaicin has moderate evidence for non-allergic rhinitis with symptom reductions in multiple studies, and a recent scoping review supports benefit across rhinitis subtypes and chronic cough, though heterogeneity is substantial; importantly, capsaicin inhalation is widely used diagnostically as a cough challenge with an excellent safety record in thousands of subjects without serious adverse events, which reassures regarding mucosal exposure in supervised settings [^111qL8iu] [^111LwRY7] [^111yG1Gs].

> Now, formulations and route-specific considerations require careful delineation. Low-concentration topical creams or gels (for example 0.025%) are applied two to four times daily for several weeks for musculoskeletal pain or localized pruritus; high-concentration 8% patches are applied once for 30–90 minutes to localized neuropathic pain areas with effects lasting up to 12 weeks and the option to repeat every 8–12 weeks; intranasal regimens vary across studies for non-allergic rhinitis; intra-articular trans-capsaicin is investigational with single-dose regimens in trials; oral/dietary capsaicin is not established for glycemic control in humans despite preclinical promise [^115qczbk] [^113GFono] [^114DP5VK] [^1129ued4].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about overall certainty; I should review risk of bias and blinding issues. Many capsaicin trials face inherent blinding challenges due to the characteristic burning sensation, which can inflate perceived effects, and several musculoskeletal and post-surgical neuropathic pain studies are small with selective reporting risks; network meta-analytic equivalence to topical NSAIDs for OA should therefore be interpreted with caution, acknowledging wide confidence intervals and limited capsaicin trial numbers [^112wPxjR] [^114pDcTB] [^1119rpsm].

> I will now examine safety and pharmacokinetics. Common reactions are local application-site burning, pain, erythema, itch, and vesiculation, generally transient and mild-to-moderate; systemic exposure after topical 8% patch is minimal with very low plasma levels and short half-life, consistent with a local mechanism of action and low systemic toxicity; broader surveillance lists uncommon events such as cough, dizziness, or hypertension, but serious systemic adverse events are rare with topical use under recommended protocols [^1164DyRt] [^113UvSyf] [^113tZMt8] [^115gDVWM].

> Let me synthesize practical clinical guidance, but first I should double-check labeled versus evidence-supported uses. Primary FDA-labeled uses include the 8% patch for PHN and low-strength topical preparations for symptomatic musculoskeletal pain, with some SPLs listing specific dosing for osteoarthritis while others categorize OA as off-label, so clinicians should verify product-specific labeling; robust evidence supports the 8% patch for PHN, and evidence supports benefit in HIV-AN and other localized neuropathic syndromes even if not all are US-labeled; guidelines place capsaicin as a reasonable second-line option in diabetic peripheral neuropathy; topical creams may help OA and low back pain, recognizing moderate evidence and blinding limitations; intranasal capsaicin is a therapeutic option for non-allergic rhinitis; capsaicin is recommended for localized chronic pruritus but not for generalized pruritus or vulvodynia; intra-articular trans-capsaicin remains investigational; metabolic benefits are preclinical and not ready for clinical adoption [^111C33vM] [^113GFono] [^115jxMLs] [^111Zn41Z].

## Pain management

### Neuropathic pain

- **Postherpetic neuralgia (PHN)**: The 8% capsaicin patch (Qutenza) is recommended by AAFP [^113GFono] and EFNS guidelines [^116GYKjW] for PHN, providing significant pain relief for up to 12 weeks following a single 30–90 minute application [^117TV6kJ] [^1171GZMy].

- **HIV-associated neuropathy**: The 8% patch is effective for HIV-associated neuropathy [^115jxMLs], with sustained pain reduction and improved quality of life.

- **Diabetic peripheral neuropathy**: Topical capsaicin is a second-line option [^111Zn41Z] for diabetic neuropathy.

- **Other neuropathic conditions**: It is used for post-surgical [^114pDcTB], post-traumatic [^112eCBoQ], and trigeminal neuralgia [^112uTvqd].

---

### Musculoskeletal pain

Osteoarthritis can be managed with **low-concentration creams (0.025%)** [^111C33vM], with efficacy similar to topical NSAIDs [^1119rpsm], and **low back pain** may be treated with short-term topical use [^115e2c9Y] (≤ 3 months).

---

## Dermatological applications

Topical capsaicin is recommended for **localized chronic pruritus** [^112cDbud] and is effective for **pruritus ani**, specifically idiopathic intractable cases [^116YvGNz].

---

## Respiratory applications

Intranasal capsaicin is effective for **non-allergic rhinitis** [^111qL8iu] and has shown positive outcomes in **chronic cough** [^111LwRY7].

---

## Metabolic and gastrointestinal effects

Dietary capsaicin improves **glucose homeostasis** by enhancing glucose tolerance via TRPV1-mediated GLP-1 secretion [^1129ued4] [^111ueixG] and has been studied for **appetite suppression** and weight management.

---

### Transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 activation enhances gut glucagon-like peptide-1 secretion and improves glucose homeostasis [^1129ued4]. Diabetes (2012). Low credibility.

Activation of TRPV1 by chronic dietary capsaicin improves glucose tolerance. TRPV1 plays a role in the regulation of glucose homeostasis, but the results have been inconsistent. This study examined whether chronic dietary capsaicin affects glucose tolerance in wild-type (WT) and TRPV1−/− mice. WT mice on a dietary capsaicin regimen demonstrated lower fasting glucose levels and improved intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test (IPGTT) outcomes compared to WT mice without dietary capsaicin (Figure 4A). However, no such changes were observed in TRPV1−/− mice, regardless of capsaicin inclusion in their diet (Figure 4B). Notably, body weight remained similar between WT and TRPV1−/− mice, irrespective of dietary capsaicin.

Furthermore, a glucose challenge revealed elevated plasma GLP-1 levels and increased GLP-1 protein expression in the ileum of WT mice subjected to chronic dietary capsaicin, effects not mirrored in TRPV1−/− mice (Figure 4C–E). These findings suggest that chronic dietary capsaicin enhances glucose tolerance through GLP-1 secretion mediated by TRPV1 activation.

	- **C and D**: Plasma GLP-1 levels following a 30-min oral glucose challenge in TRPV1−/− and WT mice. ✱ p < 0.05 versus control (n = 4).

### Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of intraarticular trans-capsaicin for pain associated with osteoarthritis of the knee [^114DP5VK]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2019). Low credibility.

To assess the efficacy and safety of high-purity synthetic trans-capsaicin (CNTX-4975) in patients with chronic moderate-to-severe osteoarthritis (OA)-associated knee pain, a phase II multicenter double-blind study was conducted. Patients aged 45–80 years with stable knee OA were randomized in a 2:1:2 ratio to receive a single intraarticular injection of placebo, CNTX-4975 0.5 mg, or CNTX-4975 1.0 mg. The primary efficacy endpoint was the area under the curve (AUC) for change from baseline in daily Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index pain with walking score (range 0–10, 0 = none and 10 = extreme) through week 12. Secondary efficacy endpoints included a similar AUC analysis of outcomes in patients treated with CNTX-4975 0.5 mg, with evaluations extending to 24 weeks.

Efficacy was evaluated in 172 patients (placebo group, n = 69; CNTX-4975 0.5 mg group, n = 33; CNTX-4975 1.0 mg group, n = 70). At week 12, greater decreases in the AUC for the pain score were observed with CNTX-4975 in the 0.5 mg and 1.0 mg groups versus placebo (0.5 mg group least squares mean difference [LSMD] -0.79, P = 0.0740; 1.0 mg group LSMD -1.6, P < 0.0001). Significant improvements were maintained at week 24 in the 1.0 mg group (LSMD -1.4, P = 0.0002). Treatment-emergent adverse events were similar in the placebo and CNTX-4975 1.0 mg groups.

In conclusion, CNTX-4975 provided dose-dependent improvement in knee OA-associated pain. CNTX-4975 1.0 mg produced a significant decrease in OA knee pain through 24 weeks; CNTX-4975 0.5 mg significantly improved symptoms as well.

### Capsaicin for non-allergic rhinitis [^111qL8iu]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

There are many forms of rhinitis. Patients are diagnosed with non-allergic rhinitis when anatomic, infectious, and allergic aetiologies have been excluded. The symptoms, including nasal congestion, blockage or obstruction, clear rhinorrhoea, sneezing, and, less frequently, nasal itching, can range from mild to debilitating. It affects between 25% and 50% of patients with rhinitis. Several medications are widely used in the treatment of non-allergic rhinitis, including oral and topical nasal antihistamines, intranasal and (rarely) systemic corticosteroids, and anticholinergics. Capsaicin, the active component of chili peppers, delivered intranasally, is considered a treatment option for non-allergic rhinitis.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effectiveness of capsaicin in the management of non-allergic rhinitis compared with no therapy, placebo, or other topical or systemic medications, or two or more of the above therapies in combination, or different capsaicin regimens.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Group Trials Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2015, Issue 5); PubMed; EMBASE; CINAHL; Web of Science; Cambridge Scientific Abstracts; ICTRP, and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 24 June 2015.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised controlled trials in adult patients with non-allergic rhinitis comparing intranasal capsaicin with no therapy, placebo, or other topical or systemic medications, or their combinations.

### Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of intraarticular trans-capsaicin for pain associated with osteoarthritis of the knee [^113RV1cc]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2019). High credibility.

This study has several limitations. Because it was a small randomized study in a specific population of patients with moderate-to-severe OA knee pain, the findings cannot be generalized to the knee OA population at large. In addition, as a small study, data regarding the safety profile are limited, although the findings are consistent with the safety profile of other capsaicin products.

In conclusion, the present results support the efficacy and safety of the intraarticular injection of trans-capsaicin to manage moderate-to-severe pain associated with knee OA. The findings indicate that further clinical development is warranted.

### Conditional recommendations for specific dietary ingredients as an approach to chronic musculoskeletal pain: Evidence-based decision aid for health care providers, participants, and policy makers [^113jdBvN]. Pain Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

Capsaicin, one of the primary constituents of the Capsicum species, is an active component of chili peppers. Capsicum is grown worldwide and adds color, pungency (i.e. heat), and aroma to food. Capsaicin is used orally, topically, and intranasally for a variety of conditions. It is most commonly used topically for musculoskeletal (MSK) conditions such as osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, neuralgias/neuropathies, back pain, fibromyalgia, and muscle spasms. In fact, both low-concentration over-the-counter (OTC) and Food and Drug Administration (FDA)–approved, high-concentration (i.e. Qutenza™) topical formulations are available.

Ten randomized controlled trials (RCTs) compared the effect of capsaicin with placebo, usual treatment, or other capsaicin products within a variety of populations, including those with osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and other MSK conditions. Capsaicin was delivered topically either as a patch or gel/cream; capsaicin gels/creams were labeled as Capsika gel®, Zostrix®, Dolarac™, Finalgon®, or Sensedol®. Daily dosages of patches containing either 0.1% or 22–37.4 ug/cm² of capsaicin were applied for periods ranging from four to 12 hours over three to four weeks. In contrast, dosages of creams containing 0.0125–0.25% capsaicin were applied two to four times daily for three to 12 weeks.

### Efficacy of Qutenza® (capsaicin) 8% patch for neuropathic pain: A meta-analysis of the Qutenza clinical trials database [^115jxMLs]. Pain (2013). Low credibility.

Qutenza® is a capsaicin patch used to treat peripheral neuropathic pain, including postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) and human immunodeficiency virus-associated neuropathy (HIV-AN). The Qutenza Clinical Trials Database has been assembled to more fully characterize the effects of Qutenza. We conducted a within-subject meta-analysis of Qutenza studies to further define the medication's efficacy profile across studies. The meta-analysis combined individual patient data from randomized, controlled studies of Qutenza in peripheral neuropathic pain (1458 subjects treated with approved doses of Qutenza or control patches; 1120 with PHN and 338 with HIV-AN).

These seven studies had similar designs and were performed with the high-dose 8% capsaicin Qutenza patch and a 0.04% low-dose control patch. The difference between treatment groups for the primary efficacy endpoint of percentage change from baseline to weeks 2 to 12 on pain intensity score was calculated. Response was defined as a ≥ 30% decrease in mean pain intensity score during weeks 2 to 12. The overall between-group difference in percentage change from baseline in pain intensity was 8.0% (95% confidence interval 4.6, 11.5; P < .001), which statistically significantly favored Qutenza over low-dose control.

Qutenza superiority was demonstrated for both PHN and HIV-AN patients for the primary endpoint and the endpoint proportion of 30% pain reduction response, and for PHN patients for the endpoint of proportion of 50% pain reduction response. These results confirm that Qutenza is effective for the treatment of both PHN and HIV-AN.

### NGX-4010, a high-concentration capsaicin patch, for the treatment of postherpetic neuralgia: A randomised, double-blind study [^1171GZMy]. The Lancet Neurology (2008). High credibility.

The limitations of treatments for postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) have led to the investigation of localized, non-systemic alternatives. NGX-4010, a high-concentration (8%) capsaicin dermal patch, was developed to treat patients with neuropathic pain. We report the results of a randomized, double-blind, 12-week study of the efficacy and safety of one application of NGX-4010 in patients with PHN.

- **Methods**: In this multicenter, double-blind, parallel-group trial, 402 patients were randomly assigned to one 60-minute application of NGX-4010 (640 microg/cm² [8% capsaicin]) or a low-concentration capsaicin control patch (3.2 microg/cm² [0.04% capsaicin]). Patients were aged 18–90 years, had had postherpetic neuralgia for at least 6 months, and had an average baseline numeric pain rating scale (NPRS) score of 3 to 9. The primary efficacy endpoint was the percentage change in NPRS score from baseline to weeks two to eight. Analysis was by intention to treat. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00115310.

- **Findings**: Patients who were randomly assigned to NGX-4010 (n = 206) had a significantly greater reduction in pain during weeks two to eight than did patients who had the control patch (n = 196). The mean changes in NPRS score were -29.6% vs. -19.9% (difference -9.7%, 95% CI -15.47 to -3.95; p = 0.001). Eighty-seven (42%) patients who received NGX-4010 and 63 (32%) controls had a 30% or greater reduction in mean NPRS score (odds ratio [OR] 1.56, 95% CI 1.03 to 2.37; p = 0.03). Patients who had NGX-4010 had significant improvements in pain during weeks two to 12.

### Systematic review of management of chronic pain after surgery [^114pDcTB]. The British Journal of Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Three trials, including data from 174 participants, evaluated capsaicin for relief of chronic pain after inguinal hernia repair, mastectomy, and diverse procedures for cancer. All studies were at risk of bias due to issues related to the blinding of a preparation with a burning sensation and erythema. One study was also at risk of bias due to selective reporting. The trial assessing a single 60-minute application of a capsaicin patch (8 percent) found no evidence of pain relief compared with placebo after three months.

Two trials of low-dose (0.075 percent) capsaicin topical cream, applied four times daily for 6–8 weeks, reported some evidence of reduced pain intensity compared with placebo. Meta-analysis suggested a modest positive effect of capsaicin topical cream on the proportion of patients reporting pain improvement (odds ratio 2.64, 95 percent confidence interval 1.02 to 6.86; I² = 0 percent) (S2, supporting information). However, caution is warranted due to the risk of bias and, as a previous Cochrane review advised, the total number of events was too few to be reliable. In both trials, a commonly reported side effect was a local skin reaction.

### A multicenter, randomized, double-blind, controlled study of NGX-4010, a high-concentration capsaicin patch, for the treatment of postherpetic neuralgia [^117TV6kJ]. Pain Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to confirm the efficacy, tolerability, and safety of NGX-4010, an 8% capsaicin dermal patch (capsaicin 640 µg/cm²), in patients with postherpetic neuralgia (PHN). PHN is a chronic pain disorder that can be difficult to treat, and treatment options are often limited by poor tolerability.

A total of 418 patients were randomized to receive a single 60-minute application of NGX-4010 or a 0.04% capsaicin control patch (3.2 µg/cm²) in a multicenter, double-blind, confirmatory, phase 3 study.

Patients were between 18–90 years old, had a diagnosis of PHN, experienced pain for at least 6 months, and had an average baseline Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS) score of 3–9.

The primary efficacy endpoint was the percentage change in NPRS score from baseline to weeks 2–8.

Results showed that NGX-4010 recipients had a significantly greater mean reduction from baseline in pain during weeks 2–8 compared with the control group (32.0% vs. 24.4%; P = 0.011). A ≥ 30% reduction in mean NPRS scores was achieved in 46% of NGX-4010 recipients compared with 34% of controls (P = 0.02). Pain was significantly lower in NGX-4010 recipients than in controls by week 2, and greater pain reduction was maintained throughout the remaining 12-week study period. Most treatment-emergent adverse events were application-site specific (notably erythema and pain), transient, and generally mild to moderate in severity.

In conclusion, in patients with PHN, a single 60-minute application of NGX-4010 produced a significant reduction in pain that was maintained over a 12-week period.

### Capsaicin 8% for peripheral neuropathic pain treatment: A retrospective cohort study [^112eCBoQ]. Pain Physician (2022). Low credibility.

Chronic neuropathic pain is a disabling condition that affects quality of life. Despite recommendations and guidelines, treatment remains suboptimal as it often does not result in significant symptom relief. The capsaicin 8% patch has been used for the treatment of several peripheral neuropathic pain etiologies with encouraging results.

- **Objectives**: To assess the results of capsaicin 8% patch on neuropathic pain by evaluating pain intensity and the painful treatment area.

- **Study design**: Observational retrospective cohort study.

- **Setting**: All patients submitted to capsaicin treatment at the Chronic Pain Unit of the Hospital Centre of Tondela Viseu, from 2011 through 2019.

- **Methods**: Records of capsaicin treatments were reviewed, and the data collected. The primary outcome was pain intensity and painful treatment area reduction between the first and last treatment. Also, the number of treatments performed, neuropathic pain duration, anatomic location, pain etiology, and concomitant oral pain medication at baseline and upon treatment conclusion was listed.

- **Results**: Postsurgical neuropathic pain was the most common etiology (49%), followed by postherpetic (28%). The median (interquartile range [IQR]) baseline pain intensity assessed by the Numeric Rating Scale (NRS-11) was 6 (5–8), and the median (IQR) final NRS-11 was 3 (1–5), with a median (IQR) relative difference of -0.5 (-0.85–0.17), with statistically significant differences (P < 0.001) between baseline and last pain intensity regarding all groups. Additionally, there was a reduction in the painful treatment area.

### Therapeutic applications of capsaicin in humans to target conditions of the respiratory system: A scoping review [^111LwRY7]. Respiratory Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Various studies have explored potential therapeutic applications of capsaicin in human medicine, for example in pain, obesity, cancer, cardiovascular, and respiratory disease. The aim of this scoping review was to identify and chart available evidence on therapeutic applications of capsaicin in humans using any mode of delivery to treat conditions of the respiratory system.

- **Methods**: Electronic bibliographic databases (Web of Science, PubMed, Medline, ScienceDirect, Embase, Scopus) were searched from inception to 2021 to identify experimental studies reporting clinical outcomes of therapeutic applications of capsaicin. Studies with or without a control group published in peer-reviewed journals were included. Animal studies, studies of human cell lines, and physiological proof of concept studies were excluded. Reviewer pairs independently double-screened 2,799 search results for inclusion.

- **Results**: Twenty-three original studies were included. Capsaicin has been investigated for the treatment of non-allergic rhinitis (n = 15), nasal polyposis (n = 3), allergic rhinitis (n = 2), unexplained chronic cough (n = 2), and prevention of aspiration pneumonia (n = 1). Modes of delivery included intranasal application (nasal spray, soaked pads, solution), inhalation, ingestion, and aural ointment. Seventeen studies reported positive effects of capsaicin on clinical outcomes for rhinitis, nasal polyposis, chronic cough, and pneumonia. Sixteen studies reported on the safety of capsaicin, with no reports of significant adverse events and overall fair to good patient acceptability.

### The capsaicin 8% patch for neuropathic pain in clinical practice: a retrospective analysis [^112uTvqd]. Pain Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

- **Methods**: All patients with a diagnosis of PNP attending the clinic for treatment with the capsaicin 8% patch were included in the analysis. Patients receiving capsaicin 8% patch treatment included some with FBSS and radiculopathy whose pain was neuropathic in nature. Most patients were treated with the capsaicin 8% patch in accordance with the manufacturer's treatment guidelines.

- **Patients**: Exceptions were noted where two patients were treated on the face for severe trigeminal neuralgia in V2. Additionally, 15 patients were treated with the capsaicin 8% patch without topical anesthetic pretreatment, and five patients were re-treated with the capsaicin 8% patch less than 90 days following their prior treatment, specifically on Days 55, 57, 77, and 84.

- **Duration of illness**: Duration of illness was estimated as the difference in months between the date of PNP diagnosis and the date of first treatment with the capsaicin 8% patch. Depending on recall precision, the mid-month or mid-year date was used. All treatments and assessments were consistent with the usual standard of care.

### Transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 activation enhances gut glucagon-like peptide-1 secretion and improves glucose homeostasis [^111ueixG]. Diabetes (2012).

Acute capsaicin administration increases GLP-1 secretion in vivo through TRPV1 activation. Capsicum frutescens, or dietary capsaicin, has been shown to affect glucose homeostasis. It is unknown whether the acute effects of capsaicin on GLP-1 secretion can be detected in vivo by TRPV1 stimulation.

We examined the effects of intragastric administration of capsaicin on the circulating levels of peptide YY (PYY), glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide, and glucagon. Fasting mice were challenged with glucose (2 g/kg) and capsaicin (1 μmol/L). The plasma PYY, glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide, and glucagon levels at 30 minutes were not different in wild-type (WT) mice with and without capsaicin administration. By contrast, administration of capsaicin or another TRPV1 agonist, RTX, increased GLP-1 secretion 30 minutes after glucose challenge, and this effect was inhibited by the TRPV1 antagonist iRTX in WT mice. However, the effect of increased GLP-1 secretion was absent in TRPV1 −/− mice. A similar effect of capsaicin on plasma insulin levels was observed.

In the absence of glucose challenge, capsaicin also slightly increased the GLP-1 levels, although plasma GLP-1 levels are much lower than in the presence of glucose challenge. We next examined the TRPV1 action using the selective GLP-1 receptor antagonist, exendin (9–39). The plasma insulin levels were significantly decreased after intraperitoneal injection of exendin (9–39) (10 µg/mice) before the glucose challenge.

In addition, the effect of oral capsaicin on plasma levels of insulin was explored.

### Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of intraarticular trans-capsaicin for pain associated with osteoarthritis of the knee [^116Nqxt2]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2019). High credibility.

Patients were enrolled between August 2015 and April 2016 at 22 sites in the US. Eligible patients were adults aged 45–80 years with a body mass index (BMI) of ≤ 45 kg/m², radiographic evidence of chronic osteoarthritis (Kellgren/Lawrence [K/L] grade 2–4) in the index knee, and moderate‐to‐severe pain in the index knee that had been stable for ≥ 2 months prior to screening. They were required to have a mean pain score of 5–9 (on a scale of 0–10, where 0 indicates no pain and 10 indicates extreme pain) at screening and baseline (day 1), based on the question in the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) addressing pain with walking. The mean pain score in the contralateral knee needed to be ≤ 3.

Additionally, patients were required to have had an inadequate response, an adverse event resulting in the discontinuation of previous treatment, or an absolute or relative contraindication (as specified in product labeling) to what would have been standard‐of‐care treatment(s). Prior standard‐of‐care may have included one or more of the following: systemic nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (oral, rectal, or injection), opioid analgesics (oral or transdermal), intraarticular glucocorticoid, or intraarticular hyaluronic acid.

Exclusion criteria included pain in the index knee due to a joint disease other than osteoarthritis; pain in the non-index knee rated at > 3 according to the WOMAC pain with walking score; use of topical capsaicin, glucocorticoid injection, or intraarticular viscosupplementation in the index knee within 90 days of screening; or any history of joint replacement surgery or open surgery on the index knee.

### The relative efficacy of topical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and capsaicin in osteoarthritis: a network meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^1119rpsm]. Osteoarthritis and Cartilage (2018). High credibility.

The objective of this study was to compare the efficacy of topical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) with topical capsaicin for pain relief in osteoarthritis (OA). A systematic literature search was conducted for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) examining any topical NSAID or capsaicin in OA. Pain relief at or nearest to four weeks was pooled using a random-effects network meta-analysis (NMA) in a Frequentist and Bayesian setting. The analysis was conducted for all trials and for trials using drugs listed as licensed for OA in the British National Formulary (BNF).

The trial network comprised 28 RCTs (7,372 participants), of which 17 RCTs (3,174 participants) were included in the "as licensed" analyses. No RCTs directly compared topical NSAIDs with capsaicin. Placebo was the only common comparator for topical NSAIDs and capsaicin. Frequentist and Bayesian effect size (ES) estimates were in agreement. Topical NSAIDs were statistically superior to placebo overall (ES 0.30, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.19 to 0.41) and as licensed (ES 0.32, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.39). However, capsaicin was only statistically superior to placebo when used at licensed doses (ES 0.41, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.64). No significant differences were observed in pain relief between topical NSAIDs and capsaicin (overall: ES 0.04, 95% CI −0.26 to 0.33; as licensed: ES −0.09, 95% CI −0.34 to 0.16).

The evidence indicates that topical NSAIDs and capsaicin in licensed doses may be equally effective for pain relief in OA. Whether the equivalence varies between individuals remains unknown.

### Topical capsaicin for pain management: Therapeutic potential and mechanisms of action of the new high-concentration capsaicin 8% patch [^113UvSyf]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2011). High credibility.

There is no evidence that topical capsaicin works through a transdermal systemic delivery into tissues other than the skin. Capsaicin is a very lipophilic, non-water-soluble compound, resisting diffusion into aqueous solutions such as blood, and it shows limited potential for transdermal delivery across human skin. Even when systemically absorbed, the duration of exposure is very short.

The oral bioavailability of capsaicin was recently reported in humans: after ingestion of 26.6 mg of capsaicin, the pharmacokinetic parameters were a Cmax of 2.5 (0.1) ng ml−1, Tmax of 47.1 (2.0) min, and T1/2 of 24.9 (5.0) min. There are no published data from low-concentration formulations. However, after 60 or 90 min capsaicin 8% patch treatments for painful peripheral neuropathy, plasma concentrations were also very low, with a population Cmax of 1.86 ng ml−1, and transient, with a mean elimination half-life of 1.64 h.

The longer elimination half-life of topical capsaicin relative to oral exposure likely reflects its slow release from the skin at the patch application site. Capsaicin is metabolized rapidly by several cytochrome (CYP) enzymes present in the human liver, but in vitro studies show that its metabolism in human skin is quite slow. The implication for topical capsaicin-containing analgesics is that capsaicin can reside at the site of action (i.e. skin) relatively unchanged, whereas any transdermally absorbed capsaicin is rapidly eliminated.

### A systematic review of treatment for patients with burning mouth syndrome [^113wRg1F]. Cephalalgia (2022). Low credibility.

Capsaicin has been shown to be an effective pain desensitizer, especially with oral topical application for up to four months. Transient receptor potential vanilloid-1 receptors (TRPV1) are found in the peripheral nervous system (PNS) and central nervous system (CNS). The number of TRPV1 receptors is significantly increased in the mucosa of patients with burning mouth syndrome (BMS).

Activation of TRPV1 at the peripheral terminal fiber endings leads to the release of neuropeptides such as substance P, neurokinin A (NKA), and calcitonin-gene-related peptide (CGRP), contributing to the onset of hyperalgesia, pain, and inflammation. Local capsaicin application activates TRPV1 and modulates the nociceptive transmission of pain impulses from the peripheral stimulation site to the central nervous system by blocking axonal transportation, depleting neuropeptides, and causing loss of membrane action potential. Hence, the capsaicin-induced analgesic effect through desensitization of the nociceptive fiber is a reversible process.

Use of topical capsaicin has been suggested in neuropathic pain, such as postherpetic neuralgia and painful HIV-associated polyneuropathy, but not in inflammatory pain such as osteoarthritis. A study showed no difference between systemic and topical capsaicin efficacy in BMS. However, gastric pain limits systemic capsaicin use. The use of topical capsaicin rinse is recommended in BMS due to its rapid action and the absence of adverse effects reported with other synthetic drugs. However, there are no known risks of long-term repeated rinsing of capsaicin, especially concerning the innervation of the oral cavity mucosa.

### Capsaicin inhibits in vitro and in vivo angiogenesis [^116K3sRZ]. Cancer Research (2004). High credibility.

Capsaicin (trans-8-methyl-N-vanillyl-6-nonenamide), a natural product of Capsicum species, is known to induce excitation of nociceptive terminals involved in pain perception. Recent studies have also shown that capsaicin not only has chemopreventive properties against certain carcinogens and mutagens but also exerts anticancer activity. Here, we demonstrated the antiangiogenic activity of capsaicin using in vitro and in vivo assay systems.

- **In vitro findings**: Capsaicin inhibited vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-induced proliferation, DNA synthesis, chemotactic motility, and capillary-like tube formation of primary cultured human endothelial cells.
- **In vivo findings**: Capsaicin inhibited both VEGF-induced vessel sprouting in rat aortic ring assay and VEGF-induced vessel formation in the mouse Matrigel plug assay. Moreover, capsaicin was able to suppress tumor-induced angiogenesis in the chick chorioallantoic membrane assay.

Capsaicin caused G(1) arrest in endothelial cells. This effect correlated with the down-regulation of cyclin D1 expression, leading to the inhibition of cyclin-dependent kinase 4-mediated phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein. Signaling experiments show that capsaicin inhibits VEGF-induced p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, p125(FAK), and AKT activation; however, its molecular target is distinct from the VEGF receptor KDR/Flk-1. Taken together, these results demonstrate that capsaicin is a novel inhibitor of angiogenesis and suggest that it may be valuable for developing pharmaceutical drugs for the treatment of angiogenesis-dependent human diseases, such as tumors.

### Capsaicin and menthol in the treatment of itch and pain: Recently cloned receptors provide the key [^116YvGNz]. Gut (2003). Low credibility.

Topical capsaicin is reported to be an effective treatment for idiopathic intractable pruritus ani. While both capsaicin and menthol application produce a transient perianal burning sensation, only capsaicin relieves itching. Classical observations on functional desensitization of nociceptors by capsaicin may explain the beneficial effects. However, the recent discovery of a range of receptors that respond to capsaicin, menthol, and temperature, and their expression in subsets of sensory nerve fibers, provides an exciting prospect towards advancing our understanding and treatment of sensory dysfunction.

### The effects of capsaicin cream on prostaglandin-induced allodynia [^112rrPLD]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2001). Low credibility.

Although intradermal injection of capsaicin produces acute pain and secondary hyperalgesia, long-term topical application of capsaicin cream has been used as a medication for pain relief in various pain conditions. We previously reported that intrathecal administration of prostaglandin (PG) E(2) and PGF(2alpha) into mice induced touch-evoked pain (allodynia) through capsaicin-sensitive and capsaicin-insensitive afferent fibers, respectively. To clarify the mechanism of an analgesic effect by capsaicin cream, we applied it to the tail and hind paws of mice and investigated its effects on PGE(2)- and PGF(2alpha)-induced allodynia. Twenty-four-hour pretreatment of mice with 0.025% or 0.05% capsaicin cream markedly alleviated allodynia induced by PGE(2) but not by PGF(2alpha). These results suggest that the topical application of capsaicin cream modulates capsaicin-sensitive afferents and ameliorates allodynia evoked by PGE(2) at the spinal level.

Topical application of capsaicin cream alleviates touch-evoked pain induced by the intrathecal administration of prostaglandin E(2). This study may provide a rationale for the use of capsaicin cream as a therapeutic drug for pain relief.

### The relative efficacy of topical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and capsaicin in osteoarthritis: A network meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^112wPxjR]. Osteoarthritis and Cartilage (2018). Low credibility.

The present meta-analysis is subject to several limitations. Firstly, the conclusions drawn are limited by the scarcity of data available on capsaicin in OA. Only four trials compare 0.025% capsaicin to placebo, and no direct estimates were available to compare topical NSAIDs to capsaicin. The low number of studies and participants on capsaicin resulted in an estimate with much uncertainty. The equivalence of the drugs may therefore be an artefact of the wide confidence intervals.

Secondly, the probability of being the best treatment is based predominantly on the effect size, not on the uncertainty of the estimate. The probability of being the best was chosen to facilitate the translation of results to clinical practice; however, the results should be interpreted with caution and in conjunction with the effect size estimates.

Thirdly, the risk of bias assessment identified concerns over the high risk of bias in included trials. Poor compliance with complete outcome data reporting, analysis of all randomized participants, and pre-specification of published outcomes all have the potential to overestimate the results of this meta-analysis.

Fourthly, because capsaicin is associated with a warming sensation upon application, making it difficult to blind, it was deemed a high risk of bias domain for all capsaicin trials. This may result in inherent differences in the placebo group across the trial network, threatening the assumption of transitivity. Furthermore, the efficacy data for topical NSAIDs is predominantly based on knee OA (22 of 23 studies), whilst the trial population for capsaicin included hand, wrist, and elbow.

### Reduced heat sensitivity and epidermal nerve fiber immunostaining following single applications of a high-concentration capsaicin patch [^114t1Rvq]. Pain (2004). Low credibility.

Capsaicin-containing plant extracts have been used as topical treatments for a variety of pain syndromes for many centuries. Products containing capsaicin in low concentrations (usually 0.025–0.075% w/w) have shown efficacy against a variety of pain conditions in clinical studies. However, to produce significant analgesic effects, these formulations require frequent re-dosing, often as much as three to five times daily for several weeks.

Previous functional and immunohistochemical studies following prolonged exposures to low-concentration capsaicin cream suggested that the duration and onset of analgesic efficacy correlate with a reduction of cutaneous nociceptive sensory nerve fiber responsiveness and immunostaining. The purpose of the present study was to determine whether a single topical application of a high-concentration capsaicin-containing (8% w/w) patch for 120 minutes or less would induce similar effects on cutaneous nociceptive nerve fibers.

Seven days following patch application, changes in heat and cold perception thresholds were determined by quantitative sensory testing, and punch biopsies were collected to assess epidermal nerve fiber (ENF) immunostaining density at the application site using PGP 9.5 as a marker. The results show a significant reduction of heat, but not cold, sensitivity and a reduction of ENF immunostaining with high-capsaicin concentration patch applications for 60 or 120 minutes, compared to placebo patch applications. Application sites exposed to low-capsaicin concentration (0.04% w/w) patches for 120 minutes or high-concentration patches…

### Progressive response to repeat application of capsaicin 179 mg (8% w/w) cutaneous patch in peripheral neuropathic pain: Comprehensive new analysis and clinical implications [^112WZ4a7]. Pain Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Some patients experience rapid and long-lasting improvements in pain following a single local treatment of peripheral NeP with the capsaicin 179 mg cutaneous patch, whereas others may follow a more progressive or incremental course of benefit in terms of pain, sleep, quality of life, and patient satisfaction. In the latter individuals, two or even three treatments, spaced eight weeks or more apart, are needed before a response is achieved. Slower responders appear to "catch up" with rapid responders over time. Repeat treatment may therefore be important to maximize efficacy in those who do not initially respond.

The capsaicin 179 mg cutaneous patch was also generally well tolerated and was associated with low levels of discontinuations due to adverse events in all subgroups studied. The potential mechanisms underlying progressive responses to the capsaicin 179 mg cutaneous patch are not fully understood, but they may relate to disease modification through "pruning" of abnormal nerve fibers, followed by regeneration of more normal fibers. This effect may become more pronounced with each successive treatment. Further studies are warranted to analyze these mechanisms in different peripheral NeP conditions.

### Topical capsaicin for pain management: Therapeutic potential and mechanisms of action of the new high-concentration capsaicin 8% patch [^112m7YK6]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2011). Low credibility.

In an attempt to evaluate whether pain relief could be achieved by a single exposure to a much higher concentration of topical capsaicin, 10 patients with intractable pain syndromes were treated with a compounded high-concentration 5–10% w/w cream. Patients were provided regional anaesthesia for tolerability, and airborne contamination of treatment rooms occurred. Based on encouraging results, a high-concentration capsaicin-containing (8%) patch designated NGX-4010, and then given the trade name Qutenza™, was developed and evaluated.

The capsaicin 8% patch is designed to rapidly deliver capsaicin into the skin while minimizing unwanted systemic or environmental exposure of capsaicin to patients and healthcare providers. Phase 1 data suggested that a single 60-minute patch application was adequate to induce nociceptor defunctionalization, as measured by reversible reduction in intra-epidermal nerve fibers (ENFs), marked by the structural nerve marker protein gene product (PGP) 9.5 immunostaining, and small, reversible alterations in cutaneous nociceptor function. Phase 3 studies demonstrated efficacy against postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) and painful HIV-associated neuropathy (HIV-AN). For both neuropathic pain syndromes, efficacy was observed to last for 12 weeks. Blinding was provided by a control patch that contained sufficient capsaicin to induce pain and erythema in a substantial number of subjects.

### The capsaicin 8% patch for neuropathic pain in clinical practice: a retrospective analysis [^1128txq7]. Pain Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

- **Re-treatment**: Twenty-two patients were re-treated with the capsaicin 8% patch between 8 and 21 weeks after the first treatment. Prior to re-treatment, mean pain levels in these patients remained significantly (P = 0.017) lower than the original mean baseline levels recorded before the first treatment (NPRS score 6.23 vs. 7.72, respectively). The reduction in NPRS score observed after re-treatment with the capsaicin 8% patch was similar to that observed after the initial treatment. At Day 7 following re-treatment, the mean NPRS score was 3.2 compared with 2.9 on Day 7 following the first treatment in these patients. The reduction in pain was maintained at a similar level over 12 weeks following re-treatment with the capsaicin 8% patch as after the initial treatment.

	- The mean reduction in NPRS score from baseline to Weeks 1–8 was also similar following re-treatment compared with the first treatment (43% vs. 52%, respectively; P = 0.552) in the 16 patients who were observed for 8 weeks following re-treatment. Of these patients, 63% (N = 10) exhibited a ≥ 30% reduction in NPRS score from baseline to Weeks 1–8.

	- Among the responders to the first capsaicin 8% patch treatment, that is, those patients who exhibited a ≥ 30% reduction in NPRS score from baseline to Weeks 1–8 following their first treatment (20 of the 22 re-treated patients), the median time to re-treatment after application of the first patch was 125 days (95% CI 93–157 days), and the mean was 191 days (95% CI 151–230 days).

- **Tolerability**: All patients completed 100% of the intended capsaicin 8% patch.

### Efficacy and safety of 0.625% and 1.25% capsaicin patch in peripheral neuropathic pain: Multi-center, randomized, and semi-double blind controlled study [^1152UxTi]. Pain Physician (2017). Low credibility.

Topical capsaicin therapy may be beneficial in providing pain relief for patients with peripheral neuropathy. The study's objectives were to investigate the efficacy and safety of 0.625% (50 µg/cm²) and 1.25% (100 µg/cm²) capsaicin patches, compared to conventional 0.075% capsaicin cream or placebo patches, in patients suffering from peripheral neuropathy.

The study design was an early Phase II, multi-center, randomized, semi-double-blind, and placebo-controlled clinical trial conducted in two medical college teaching hospitals. Sixty patients were randomized to receive either the 0.625% capsaicin patch, the 1.25% capsaicin patch, a placebo-controlled patch, or 0.075% capsaicin cream. The primary efficacy endpoint was the mean difference in the change of the daily numerical rating scale (NRS) pain score. Secondary endpoints included the Daily Sleep Interference Scale scores, the percentage of patients achieving a ≥ 30% or ≥ 50% reduction in pain, and data for Global Impression Change (GIC) and EQ-5D.

The results indicated that patients treated with the 0.625% capsaicin patch and 0.075% capsaicin cream showed statistically significant improvement in pain after six weeks of treatment. However, daily sleep disorder scores improved only for those patients using the 0.075% capsaicin cream. The majority (11 of 12) of patients in the 0.625% capsaicin patch group reported improved pain according to patient-derived GIC scores. Regarding safety, two severe adverse events were reported in the 0.075% capsaicin cream group only. Repeated patch application was associated with minor skin problems, such as burning sensation, erythema, pruritus, and ves.

### Systematic review of topical capsaicin for the treatment of chronic pain [^117RkXQ9]. BMJ (2004). Low credibility.

To determine the efficacy and safety of topically applied capsaicin for chronic pain from neuropathic or musculoskeletal disorders, data were gathered from various sources including the Cochrane Library, Medline, Embase, PubMed, an in-house database, and contact with manufacturers of topical capsaicin.

Randomized controlled trials compared topically applied capsaicin with placebo or another treatment in adults with chronic pain. The primary outcome measured was the dichotomous information for the number of patients experiencing about a 50% reduction in pain, with outcomes extracted at four weeks for musculoskeletal conditions and eight weeks for neuropathic conditions. Secondary outcomes included adverse events and withdrawals due to these events.

The data synthesis included six double-blind placebo-controlled trials involving 656 patients for neuropathic conditions, showing a relative benefit from topical capsaicin 0.075% compared with placebo of 1.4 (95% confidence interval 1.2 to 1.7), with a number needed to treat of 5.7 (4.0 to 10.0). For musculoskeletal conditions, three double-blind placebo-controlled trials with 368 patients were analyzed, revealing a relative benefit from topical capsaicin 0.025% or plaster compared to placebo of 1.5 (1.1 to 2.0) and a number needed to treat of 8.1 (4.6 to 34). Approximately one-third of patients experienced local adverse events with capsaicin, which were unlikely with the placebo.

Although topically applied capsaicin has moderate to poor efficacy in the treatment of chronic musculoskeletal or neuropathic pain, it may still be useful.

### The capsaicin 8% patch for neuropathic pain in clinical practice: a retrospective analysis [^115F6rKa]. Pain Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

In all patients (N = 68), treatment with the capsaicin 8% patch led to a rapid decrease in pain, evident from 7 days post-treatment (Figure 1). At Day 7, there was a significant (P < 0.001) mean reduction in the Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS) score compared with baseline. This significant pain reduction was maintained up to 12 weeks post-treatment. Among patients followed up at 12 weeks (N = 44), there was still a reduction from baseline pain score of 43.4% (95% confidence interval [CI] 31.3–55.5%; P < 0.001).

- **Figure 1**: Mean NPRS score after treatment with the capsaicin 8% patch. The absolute NPRS scores on Days 0, 3, 7, 28, 56, and 84 post-treatment are shown for patients who were treated once with the capsaicin 8% patch and for those who received a second treatment. ✱ p < 0.001 for all patients, first treatment. † One patient missed the 4-week follow-up and could not be included in the responder analysis of patients with a complete follow-up of at least 8 weeks (N = 53). However, 8-week data were available for this patient, so they were included in the data presented here. Likewise, 12-week data were available for N = 45 patients, but only N = 44 patients had a complete follow-up of 12 weeks.

### The relative efficacy of topical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and capsaicin in osteoarthritis: a network meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^114zgaNk]. Osteoarthritis and Cartilage (2018). High credibility.

This work forms part of a project examining the relative efficacy of topical NSAIDs and capsaicin in osteoarthritis (OA) and neuropathic pain. The protocol is published and is also available on PROSPERO (2016:CRD42016035254).

- **Eligibility criteria**: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing any topical NSAID or capsaicin to placebo in participants with OA were included. No other comparators were included for this analysis, and only placebo-controlled trials were examined. Participants with painful physician-diagnosed OA (clinical or radiographic) or chronic joint pain attributable to OA at any site (excluding the spine) were included. Spinal pain was excluded as it is difficult to differentiate between OA pain and back pain secondary to other aetiologies. Trials with pain due to multiple conditions were included if the data for OA could be extracted separately. Trials had to be a minimum of 1 week duration and report pain outcomes. Full texts published in any language and at any date were considered.

- **Identification and selection of trials**: A search strategy, based on terms for (1) RCTs; (2) topical administration; (3) OA; and (4) capsaicin or NSAIDs, was created. Medline, Embase, Allied and Complementary Medicine Database (AMED), Cumulative Index for Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Web of Science, and Cochrane Library were searched up to 16/11/2015. The searches were updated on 10/01/2018. In addition, reference lists of included publications and meta-analyses in the area were searched for eligible trials.

### Progressive response to repeat application of capsaicin 179 mg (8% w/w) cutaneous patch in peripheral neuropathic pain: Comprehensive new analysis and clinical implications [^114HMMjd]. Pain Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

The assessment of the evolution of responder rates, defined as the proportion of patients with a ≥ 30% reduction from baseline in average daily pain (Numeric Pain Rating Scale score), is crucial to understanding the contribution of each application of the capsaicin 179 mg cutaneous patch to the overall result. These results have been reported only partially for PACE and not yet for STRIDE. Given the high granularity of the data collected in these two clinical trials, it is feasible to assess the decrease in pain scores and consequently, responder rates after successive treatments with the capsaicin 179 mg cutaneous patch.

The objectives of the present post hoc analysis of data from STRIDE and PACE were to investigate: 1) whether there is any evidence of efficacy of the capsaicin 179 mg cutaneous patch in patients who did not achieve a pain response after the first application, and 2) how many separate applications may be reasonable before reaching a conclusion on whether or not to continue treatment.

### Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN): Current therapies and topical treatment option with high-concentration capsaicin [^113rfGEJ]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2021). Low credibility.

Cannabinoids: Clinical trials provide little medical evidence that cannabinoid-based medicines effectively treat neuropathic pain. Data from a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot study in 16 patients could not support a substantial benefit of cannabinoids in treating CIPN. According to the guideline of the German Society for Neurology, cannabinoids are not recommended for treating neuropathic pain of any origin, as efficacy is low and the rate of side effects is high. In individual cases, and after the failure of other therapeutic options, treatment with cannabinoids may be considered in the context of multimodal pain therapy.

- **Pharmacological intervention — Topical therapies**:
	- **Patches**:
		1. **Lidocaine**: The lidocaine patch (700 mg) is approved for treating postherpetic neuralgia but has also been suggested by guidelines for treating localized neuropathic pain of other origins, including CIPN. However, randomized clinical trials proving efficacy in CIPN are missing at the time of writing. Lidocaine patches might be used as a second-line option for treating peripheral neuropathic pain, especially in cases of intolerability to oral medications (e.g. in elderly patients).
		2. **Capsaicin**: In Europe, the capsaicin patch (179 mg) is approved for the topical treatment of peripheral neuropathic pain as monotherapy or in combination with other pharmaceutical products for pain treatment. The guideline of the German Society for Neurology recommends the capsaicin 179 mg patch for any kind of neuropathic pain as a second-line therapy. The effect is comparable…

### Topical capsaicin for pain management: Therapeutic potential and mechanisms of action of the new high-concentration capsaicin 8% patch [^116BjsJu]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2011). High credibility.

The efficacy of the capsaicin 8% patch was evaluated in post-herpetic neuralgia patients. The study measured the percentage change from baseline in the mean numeric pain rating scale (NPRS) score during weeks 2–8, which was the primary endpoint of two similarly designed randomized, double-blind, multicentre trials (C116 and C117). Capsaicin 8% w/w or control (capsaicin 0.04% w/w) patches were applied once for 60 minutes to the painful areas, and patients were followed for 12 weeks. The mean baseline NPRS scores per group ranged from 5.7 to 6.0. Results showed a significant difference: *P✱ = 0.011, **P✱✱ = 0.001 versus control.

In 2009, Qutenza™ was approved for the treatment of peripheral neuropathic pain in non-diabetic adults in the EU, and in the United States for managing neuropathic pain associated with post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN). An important aspect of this formulation, compared to low-concentration capsaicin formulations, is the removal of potential variability in administration and lack of patient compliance. This is achieved since its use occurs under the supervision of a healthcare professional and requires only a single application for 30 or 60 minutes. Furthermore, the environmental contamination issues associated with home use are avoided.

### Posttraumatic and postsurgical neuropathic pain responsive to treatment with capsaicin 8% topical patch [^115knk1Y]. Pain Physician (2014). Low credibility.

Capsaicin 8% patch (Qutenza) is mainly used to treat postherpetic neuralgia and human immunodeficiency virus-associated neuropathy. However, evidence of the efficacy of Qutenza in other forms of neuropathic pain is lacking. A 24-year-old Libyan man, with no previous medical history, sustained multiple wounds on the right side of the chest and back following a bomb explosion. The patient experienced pain, which persisted in a wide area around the surgical intervention for a long time, beyond the usual course of natural healing of acute pain, and was different from that suffered preoperatively.

The characteristics of the pain included burning, electric shock-like sensation, tingling, and numbness, and it was paroxysmal. The pain was associated with hyperalgesia and intense allodynia in a wide area, approximately 1,100 cm². Our initial treatment strategy included pregabalin, tramadol, and duloxetine. However, our patient's pain responded to treatment with capsaicin 8% patch when the initial treatments showed only minimal effectiveness regarding the intensity of pain. Interestingly, the most important finding was that capsaicin 8% patch showed a more than 80% reduction of the area of allodynia associated with the pain when other treatments failed.

Moreover, although recent data showed that in patients who respond to Qutenza, analgesia starts within a few days of treatment and lasts on average 5 months, our patient showed an initial response within 7 days of treatment and a longer duration of more than 18 months. Although further controlled studies are needed to explore the full potential of this treatment, the findings are promising.

### The relative efficacy of topical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and capsaicin in osteoarthritis: A network meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^114ZRdMs]. Osteoarthritis and Cartilage (2018). Low credibility.

Evidence indicates that topical NSAIDs and capsaicin, when used as licensed, are both superior to placebo for pain relief. No significant differences were identified in the level of pain relief offered by topical NSAIDs compared to capsaicin. However, limited and poor-quality evidence for capsaicin in OA provides uncertainty. Displaying seemingly negligible differences in efficacy, the decision of whether to prescribe topical NSAIDs or capsaicin should be guided by patient preference, safety, costs, and subsequent individual patient response.

Focusing on licensed doses of these two drugs renders the results of this meta-analysis more relevant for clinicians as they relate directly to the drugs recommended for prescription. The list of approved drugs was extracted from the BNF, a resource commonly used to guide prescribing practice in the UK. The BNF was chosen as the leading authority on clinicians' selection of medicines in the UK; however, it should be noted that they offer only recommendations of licensed medications, and physicians can prescribe medications outside the recommended list.

No direct or indirect (via NMA) quantitative evidence of the relative efficacy of topical NSAIDs vs capsaicin has been published previously. Some guidelines, such as those by the Osteoarthritis Research Society International (OARSI) and the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR), provide equal recommendations for the two treatments. This may indicate a perceived equivalence in efficacy, in line with the findings of the meta-analysis.

### Topical capsaicin for pain management: Therapeutic potential and mechanisms of action of the new high-concentration capsaicin 8% patch [^116VFphH]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2011). Low credibility.

A persistent confusion in the medical literature involves the role of substance P depletion in capsaicin-induced pain relief. The neurogenic inflammation following the application of topical capsaicin is due to the vascular actions of substance P and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) released from C-fibres. Mast cell degranulation contributes to this but is not necessary. There is no evidence that the neurogenic inflammation accompanying topical capsaicin administration is related to prolonged pain relief, despite the systemic capsaicin's ability to cause substance P release by nociceptors.

In the early and mid-1980s, researchers observed that skin substance P levels were significantly reduced after topical treatment with capsaicin. At that time, substance P was considered a fundamentally important signal for pain neurotransmission, leading to substantial efforts to develop substance P receptor antagonists. The coincidental reduction of substance P content was inferred to play a causal role in capsaicin-induced pain relief. However, substance P receptor antagonists have failed as analgesics in numerous clinical trials, and it is now widely recognized that CGRP, rather than substance P, is a more likely contributor to pain pathophysiology, particularly in migraines.

If nociceptive nerve fibres retract from the epidermis and dermis, all markers they contain, including substance P, will be lost. The reduction of substance P content in the skin after topical c

### Role of capsaicin in a murine model of labor and delivery [^116mmjKH]. Anesthesiology (2013). Low credibility.

The objectives of this study were to develop a murine model of labor and delivery and to use this model to examine whether capsaicin diminishes labor pain and expedites delivery.

- **Methods**: To develop a murine model of labor pain, the authors identified and compared the incidence of four proposed pain behaviors in 46 mice: (1) no analgesia in labor and the postpartum period, and (2) increasing doses of an analgesic, morphine. The model was then used to examine the impact of topical cervical capsaicin on: (1) labor pain behaviors, and (2) labor progress by examining its impact on the time from treatment to delivery of the first pup and on the duration of delivery per pup. The treatment was randomly allocated and the behavioral observation was blinded.

- **Results**: In the absence of analgesia, there was a statistically significant decrease in all four proposed pain behaviors in the postpartum period compared with labor (cumulative 55.0 ± 16.1/h vs. 16.1 ± 8.7/h; P < 0.0001). Additionally, morphine reduced their incidence during labor in a dose-dependent manner (cumulative 55.0 ± 16.1/h control, 46.4 ± 15.8 morphine 0.1 mg/kg/h, 34.6 ± 5.6/h morphine 0.5 mg/kg/h; P = 0.1988, 0.0014). Furthermore, the incidence of identified pain behaviors was reduced by pericervical capsaicin (cumulative 55.0 ± 16.1/h control, 38.9 ± 15.4 capsaicin; P = 0.02).

- **Conclusions**: In this pilot study, the authors developed a novel mouse model of labor and delivery. Pericervical capsaicin applied days before delivery reduces labor pain behaviors.

### Impact of topical capsaicin cream on thermoregulation and perception while walking in the cold [^117UTBST]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

Capsaicin, a chili pepper extract, can stimulate increased skin blood flow (SkBF) with a perceived warming sensation on application areas. Larger surface area application may exert a more systemic thermoregulatory response. Capsaicin could assist with maintaining heat transport to the distal extremities, minimizing cold weather injury risk. However, the thermoregulatory and perceptual impact of topical capsaicin cream application prior to exercise in the cold is unknown.

- **Methods**: Following application of either a 0.1% capsaicin or control cream to the upper and lower extremities (10g total, ∼40–50% body surface area), 11 participants in shorts and a t-shirt were exposed to 30 minutes of cold (0°C, 40% relative humidity). Exposures comprised of 5 minutes of seated rest, 20 minutes of walking (1.6 m·s⁻¹, 5% grade), and 5 minutes of seated rest. Temperature (skin, core), SkBF, skin conductivity, heart rate, thermal sensation, and thermal comfort were measured throughout.

- **Results**: The capsaicin treatment did not differ from the control treatment in skin temperature (treatment mean: 30.0 ± 2.5°C, 30.1 ± 2.4°C, respectively, p = 0.655), core temperature (treatment mean: 37.3 ± 0.5°C, 37.4 ± 0.4°C, respectively, p = 0.113), SkBF (treatment mean: -8.4 ± 10.0, -11.1 ± 10.7 A.U., respectively, p = 0.492), skin conductivity (treatment mean: -0.7 ± 5.1, 0.4 ± 6.4 µS, respectively, p = 0.651), or heart rate (treatment mean: 83 ± 29, 85 ± 28 beats·minute⁻¹, respectively, p = 0.234). The capsaicin and control treatments also did not differ in thermal sensation (p = 0.521) and thermal comfort (p = 0.982).

### Safety of capsaicin cough challenge testing [^111yG1Gs]. Chest (2005). Low credibility.

Capsaicin, the pungent extract of red peppers, has achieved widespread use in clinical research because it induces cough in a dose-dependent and reproducible manner. Although more than two decades of experience have led investigators to consider capsaicin cough challenge testing a safe diagnostic modality, this issue has not been specifically addressed in the literature.

- **Study objectives**: To review the published experience with capsaicin inhalation challenge testing in terms of safety.

- **Design**: Literature review and personal communication with study authors.

- **Setting**: Academic medical center.

- **Results**: One hundred twenty-two published studies since 1984 described 4,833 subjects (4,374 adults, 459 children) undergoing capsaicin cough challenge, with no serious adverse events reported. Subjects included healthy volunteers as well as patients with asthma, COPD, pathologic cough, and other respiratory conditions. Minor complaints described in a small fraction of studies consisted mainly of transient throat irritation. Personal communication with the authors of more than 90% of the studies confirmed an absence of any serious adverse events. Furthermore, these investigators have performed thousands of additional capsaicin challenge studies not reported in the literature, also without any associated serious adverse events.

- **Conclusions**: A review of the 20-year clinical experience has failed to uncover a single serious adverse event associated with capsaicin cough challenge testing in humans. Given the need for better antitussive therapies, capsaicin represents a vital component of future research efforts.

### 8% capsaicin patch in treatment of peripheral neuropathic pain [^1114hhik]. Pain Physician (2020). Low credibility.

Neuropathic pain is a complex condition that is difficult to control and significantly impacts the quality of life. The 8% capsaicin patch is a potential therapeutic strategy for treating peripheral neuropathic pain.

- **Objectives**: This study aims to evaluate the clinical efficacy and tolerability of the 8% capsaicin patch in a Pain Unit.

- **Study design**: Retrospective observational study.

- **Setting**: Portuguese Pain Unit.

- **Methods**: A sample of 120 patients diagnosed with peripheral neuropathic pain underwent treatment with the 8% capsaicin patch between February 2011 and February 2019 in a Portuguese Pain Unit. Patients were included in one of the following groups according to the etiology of pain: postherpetic neuralgia (PHN), chronic post-surgical pain (CPSP), post-traumatic neuropathic pain (PTNP), diabetic neuropathy (DN), complex regional pain syndrome I and II (CRPS I/II), HIV-associated neuropathy (HIVN), lumbar neuropathic pain (LNP), trigeminal neuralgia (TN), and other neuropathies (O). The evaluated parameters were pain intensity according to unit protocol (numerical rating scale), pain characteristics, location, and size of the painful area. The evolution of pain intensity after treatment was measured. Patients were considered responders to therapy if the decrease in the numerical rating scale (NRS) was equal to or greater than 30%; patients with a decrease in NRS of 50% or more were also analyzed. Additionally, the area of pain, the need for adjuvant analgesic therapy, tolerability to treatment, and identification of potential predictors of efficacy were evaluated at 15 days and 8 weeks.

### Topical capsaicin for pain management: Therapeutic potential and mechanisms of action of the new high-concentration capsaicin 8% patch [^117FM3mB]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2011). Low credibility.

The site of action of topical capsaicin is in the skin, and pain relief is not mediated by transdermal systemic delivery. Due to its near insolubility in water, capsaicin is not readily absorbed into the microvasculature. When cutaneous nociceptors are hypersensitive and sometimes spontaneously active, localized defunctionalization of capsaicin-responsive nerve fiber terminals in the epidermis and dermis can reduce the afferent barrage, which may drive pain syndromes. Mitochondrial dysfunction leads to nerve terminal retraction.

- **Loss of ENFs**: Topical capsaicin treatment leads to a reversible loss of epidermal nerve fibers (ENFs). Human leg (calf) skin biopsies were analyzed at different times: pre-capsaicin treatment (baseline; PGP 9.5; TRPV1), 1 day post-treatment (PGP 9.5; TRPV1), and 54 days post-treatment (PGP 9.5; TRPV1). Biopsies were immunostained with antibodies to structural nerve marker PGP 9.5, and the heat and capsaicin receptor TRPV1. There was a marked loss of ENFs and sub-ENFs after capsaicin treatment for 3 days (day 1 biopsy), with a majority of ENFs regenerating by day 54 (magnification ×40).

### The relative efficacy of topical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and capsaicin in osteoarthritis: A network meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^1171NcEr]. Osteoarthritis and Cartilage (2018). High credibility.

Although pain in osteoarthritis (OA) has traditionally been viewed as nociceptive in nature, it is now widely accepted that some people experience pain with neuropathic-like components. Pain descriptors indicative of neuropathic pain, such as "burning" and "shooting" pain, are used by subsets of individuals with OA. In fact, almost 15% of people with knee pain report neuropathic-like pain. This subgroup is of importance as true neuropathic pain is often difficult to manage and commonly does not respond to traditional analgesics, such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Capsaicin, however, is licensed and used in neuropathic pain where it is effective at higher doses. It may therefore be that individuals with predominantly nociceptive OA pain benefit from topical NSAIDs, whilst those with neuropathic pain components may benefit more from topical capsaicin. Further evidence on pain phenotypes and response to these two commonly used topical analgesics is warranted.

### The capsaicin 8% patch for neuropathic pain in clinical practice: a retrospective analysis [^114Ayd8H]. Pain Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

As a retrospective analysis, this study is limited by a lack of randomization and placebo control and only represents experience from a single clinic. Consequently, additional analysis of patient responses to the capsaicin 8% patch in other real-life clinical settings will be required to validate the data presented here. Additional studies across a wider variety of peripheral neuropathic pain (PNP) conditions are also warranted, and patient benefits relating to the reduction in the use of concomitant medications should be explored further. Nevertheless, the data presented here support the efficacy of the capsaicin 8% patch to treat neuropathic pain (NP) and suggest that response rates may even be higher when used in real-life clinical practice than they were during clinical trials. Furthermore, the data show that the capsaicin 8% patch can provide rapid and sustained reductions in pain levels in patients with a variety of PNP conditions, together with a significant reduction in the requirement for prescribed concomitant pain medications. These data indicate that the capsaicin 8% patch will be a very useful addition to the treatment options available for NP.

### The capsaicin 8% patch for neuropathic pain in clinical practice: a retrospective analysis [^115oE49C]. Pain Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

The capsaicin 8% patch (Qutenza™) is an alternative treatment option for neuropathic pain (NP) that is designed to deliver a high dose of capsaicin topically where the pain is experienced. Capsaicin, the active component of chili peppers, is an agonist of transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) channels, which play an important role in the transmission of pain signals. Continuous activation of TRPV1 causes nociceptor defunctionalization — accompanied by a reversible reduction in epidermal nerve fiber density — and an inhibition of pain transmission. This results in a prolonged, but reversible, reduction in the symptoms of peripheral neuropathic pain (PNP).

The capsaicin 8% patch was approved in the European Union (EU) in 2009 for the treatment of PNP in nondiabetic adults, either alone or in combination with other medicinal products, based on an extensive clinical trial program investigating its efficacy and safety for the treatment of NP, particularly in patients with postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) or HIV-associated neuropathy (HIV-AN). Results from the Phase III trials demonstrated that a single 30- or 60-minute application of the capsaicin 8% patch significantly reduced pain for 3 months in patients with HIV-AN or PHN, respectively. The capsaicin 8% patch retains its efficacy upon re-treatment and is effective both as a monotherapy and when used in conjunction with concomitant medications for NP. In the EU, the capsaicin 8% patch is not licensed for use in patients with diabetes due to a lack of data from this patient population, as studies are still ongoing.

### The capsaicin 8% patch for neuropathic pain in clinical practice: a retrospective analysis [^111popQs]. Pain Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Pain levels were assessed using the 11-point Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS), asking patients the question, "What is your pain now?" All patients received a baseline assessment in the clinic on the day of capsaicin 8% patch treatment to determine pretreatment pain levels. The patient's pain was assessed immediately after capsaicin 8% patch treatment, and then on Days 1 and 3, and during Weeks 1, 4, 8, and 12 following. Follow-up was carried out by telephone call or face-to-face clinic contact on Days 1 and 3, and Weeks 1, 4, 8, and 12.

Change in pain was assessed both in absolute terms (unit of NPRS change) and as a percentage change from baseline (prior to the first capsaicin 8% patch treatment). Pain response to the first capsaicin 8% patch treatment was calculated as the percentage change between the baseline NPRS value and the average of NPRS scores at Weeks 1, 4, and 8. As in the capsaicin 8% clinical trials, a responder was defined as a patient who exhibited a ≥ 30% decrease in NPRS score from baseline.

- **Re-treatment**: Patients were re-treated with the capsaicin 8% patch when their pain significantly increased and they were in discomfort again; pain did not have to return to baseline levels for re-treatment to be undertaken.

- **Prescribed concomitant pain medication use**: Prescribed concomitant pain medications taken by patients were assessed throughout the follow-up period, and these medications were modified as appropriate. At the 4-week follow-up, potential changes to prescribed concomitant neuropathic pain medications were discussed with the patient.

### Topical capsaicin (low concentration) for chronic neuropathic pain in adults [^116fQ2yE]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Topical creams with capsaicin are used to treat pain from a wide range of chronic conditions, including neuropathic pain. When applied to the skin, capsaicin initially causes enhanced sensitivity to noxious stimuli, followed by a period of reduced sensitivity and, after repeated applications, persistent desensitization. There is uncertainty about the efficacy and tolerability of capsaicin for treating painful chronic neuropathies. This is an update of an earlier review of topical capsaicin for chronic neuropathic pain in adults that looked at all doses and formulations of capsaicin. The original review has now been split: here we consider only formulations using a low concentration of capsaicin (< 1%) applied several times daily over several weeks, while another review will consider a single application of capsaicin at a high concentration.

- **Objectives**: To review the evidence from controlled trials on the efficacy and tolerability of topically applied low-concentration (< 1%) capsaicin in chronic neuropathic pain in adults.

- **Search methods**: Cochrane CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Oxford Pain Relief Database were searched up to July 2012.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies of at least six weeks' duration, using low-concentration (< 1%) topical capsaicin to treat neuropathic pain.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently assessed study quality and validity, and extracted data. Information was extracted on the number of participants with pain relief (clinical improvement) after at least six weeks, and with local skin.

### Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of intraarticular trans-capsaicin for pain associated with osteoarthritis of the knee [^111WNeCE]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2019). Low credibility.

This study consisted of a screening period, a single treatment day (day 1), and a 24-week follow-up period. At the investigators' discretion, patients could be premedicated using an opioid, NSAID, or local anesthetic (e.g. ethyl chloride, topical or subcutaneous lidocaine), with a maximum of two premedications.

After 15 minutes of joint cooling with a wrap placed around the knee, patients received 15 mL of intraarticular 2% lidocaine without epinephrine. The purposes, in order of importance, were: 1) achieving the targeted concentration of capsaicin, 2) improving distribution of capsaicin within the joint, and 3) decreasing the initial pain associated with injection. Cooling was reapplied for 30 minutes. The study drug was then provided in a vehicle consisting of polyethylene glycol 300, which was diluted to 30% (volume/volume) at the point of care with sterile water for injection.

A single intraarticular injection (4 ml) of placebo (vehicle control), CNTX-4975 0.5 mg, or CNTX-4975 1.0 mg was administered. The CNTX-4975 and placebo injections were identical in appearance and viscosity. Injection into the joint was confirmed by ultrasound and/or joint fluid aspiration. Cooling was removed for injection and then reapplied immediately for 30 minutes to 1 hour. Patients were advised not to take a hot bath or shower or expose the injected knee to external heat within 24 hours after the injection.

Throughout the study, patients were permitted to take oral rescue medications for osteoarthritis pain in the index knee (see Supplementary Table 1 on the Arthritis & Rheumatology website).

### Progressive response to repeat application of capsaicin 179 mg (8% w/w) cutaneous patch in peripheral neuropathic pain: Comprehensive new analysis and clinical implications [^115P5wKq]. Pain Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

As would be expected, treatment discontinuations among non-responders in both trials resulted primarily from lack of efficacy or withdrawal of consent. In both trials, discontinuation rates were low among responders, and there were no obvious differences in discontinuation profiles among those responding after one, two, or three applications of the capsaicin 179 mg cutaneous patch.

- **Differential use of concomitant pain medication**: This is a potential confounder of the analysis of responses. Across trials and in all three subgroups, pregabalin or gabapentin were more often discontinued than initiated. Opioids were initiated in a slightly higher proportion than discontinued in those responding after the first and second treatment across trials, and hence there are no data to suggest that greater use of other pain medications could explain apparent responses in those who responded only after the second or third application of the capsaicin 179 mg cutaneous patch.

- **Treatment intervals**: Throughout STRIDE, the treatment intervals were standardized to ensure consistent application and response monitoring.

### Topical capsaicin for pain management: Therapeutic potential and mechanisms of action of the new high-concentration capsaicin 8% patch [^11325hWg]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2011). Low credibility.

Rapid delivery of capsaicin may promote, rather than reduce, the tolerability of topical capsaicin. Some of the defunctionalization mechanisms discussed above can occur very rapidly, and in vitro loss of capsaicin responsiveness may develop within 20 seconds. By driving cutaneous nociceptors to a defunctionalized state quickly, the inevitable pungency may be greatly mitigated. Indeed, in clinical studies with capsaicin 8% patch, less than 2% of patients asked for early removal of the patch due to intolerance.

With respect to the sites of capsaicin action within the skin, most studies point to the highest level of TRPV1 expression in nociceptive sensory nerve fibers, although there have been several reports of TRPV1 expression in skin cells other than neurons, particularly in cultured cells. For instance, one report provided indirect evidence that TRPV1 activation mediated functional responses in a human keratinocyte cell line (HaCaT). However, when freshly dispersed human keratinocytes were exposed to capsaicin by another group, no functional response was observed at pharmacologically relevant concentrations, and 300 μM capsaicin was cytotoxic independent of TRPV1. Such studies emphasize that the presence of mRNA or even measurable protein does not necessarily ensure a physiological role for that protein in a cell type, and that the interpretation of data from immortal cell lines can be problematic because their phenotypes may diverge from the source tissue. The specificity of TRPV1 immuno-detection in neural elements is primarily in human dorsal root ganglion sensory neurons.
