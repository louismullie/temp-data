## Question

Which kinase inhibitor prevents relapse in patients with schizophrenia?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which kinase inhibitor prevents relapse in patients with schizophrenia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what constitutes evidence-based relapse prevention in schizophrenia. Then, I should verify how "kinase inhibitors" are defined and indicated in the provided documents. Next, I need to check for any overlap — are kinase inhibitors used, studied, or approved for schizophrenia relapse prevention. After that, I will review whether any off-label or investigational signals exist in these materials. Finally, I will conclude clearly and, if the premise is unsupported, state what actually prevents relapse and why, with citations to guidelines and pivotal trials.

> Let me first confirm the standard of care for relapse prevention in schizophrenia, since that frames the clinical question. Maintenance antipsychotic therapy reduces relapse risk, with guidelines recommending continued antipsychotic treatment after remission, and long-acting injectables considered when adherence is a priority or preference, often reducing relapse and hospitalization risk compared with oral formulations in discontinuation designs and real-world use [^1113Tj5s] [^112aW9Zw] [^115F29cx] [^113Qe4hb].

> I will now examine what the documents label as "kinase inhibitors", because I need to ensure I'm not conflating oncology agents with psychotropics. The materials describe gilteritinib (FLT3 inhibitor) for AML, everolimus (mTOR inhibitor) for cancers and TSC, dasatinib (BCR-ABL/SRC inhibitor) with CNS penetration for Ph+ leukemia, Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitors for CLL, and tivozanib (VEGFR TKI) for renal cell carcinoma — these are all oncology indications, not schizophrenia [^115BrQZ8] [^116e2WSZ] [^114hHmVK] [^111cipXv] [^116MX2US].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — I should double-check for any overlap between kinase inhibitors and schizophrenia relapse prevention in the provided sources. After reviewing, I find no evidence that any kinase inhibitor is used, studied, or approved for preventing relapse in schizophrenia in these documents; conversely, relapse prevention evidence consistently involves antipsychotics targeting dopamine/serotonin systems, with maintenance trials showing delayed time to relapse versus placebo for agents like aripiprazole, quetiapine XR, cariprazine, and lurasidone, aligning with guidelines emphasizing antipsychotic maintenance rather than kinase pathway modulation [^113h1BWX] [^115PUku3] [^114KCpz7] [^111K3PGm] [^1113Tj5s].

> Wait, let me verify a potential pitfall: dasatinib does cross the blood–brain barrier and is active in CNS leukemia — could that imply psychiatric relapse prevention utility. On closer inspection, that CNS activity pertains to leukemic disease control, not modulation of psychosis pathophysiology or relapse prevention in schizophrenia; similarly, everolimus targets mTOR signaling relevant to oncology and TSC, but the provided materials do not present evidence for schizophrenia relapse prevention with mTOR inhibition, so I should not infer such use from mechanistic plausibility alone in this corpus [^114hHmVK] [^116e2WSZ].

> I need to ensure the conclusion is precise: based on the provided documents, no kinase inhibitor is indicated for, or has been shown to, prevent relapse in patients with schizophrenia; the references frame kinase inhibitors strictly within oncology contexts, whereas schizophrenia relapse prevention is achieved with maintenance antipsychotic therapy and related psychiatric care pathways, so the premise conflates distinct drug classes and disease domains [^115BrQZ8] [^116e2WSZ] [^111cipXv] [^1113Tj5s].

> Let me now anchor what actually prevents relapse, because clinically that's what guides treatment. Maintenance antipsychotics reduce relapse versus placebo in randomized withdrawal designs, with evidence across multiple agents (for example, aripiprazole 15 mg/day, quetiapine XR 400–800 mg/day, cariprazine 3–9 mg/day, lurasidone 40–80 mg/day), and guidelines recommend considering LAIs to support adherence and reduce relapse risk; in real-world cohorts after a first relapse, switching to clozapine is associated with lower risk of a second relapse compared with switching among non-clozapine orals, underscoring evidence-based pharmacologic strategies distinct from kinase inhibition [^113h1BWX] [^115PUku3] [^114KCpz7] [^111K3PGm] [^113Qe4hb] [^114BxJu6].

> Next, I should review adjunctive, non-pharmacologic relapse-prevention supports to ensure I'm not overlooking validated alternatives. Technology-enhanced relapse prevention programs have reduced days hospitalized post-discharge in schizophrenia-spectrum disorders, complementing pharmacologic maintenance; these are supportive measures rather than replacements for antipsychotic maintenance, and again do not involve kinase inhibitors in the provided corpus [^117CHLNV].

No kinase inhibitor [^115BrQZ8] [^116e2WSZ] [^116MX2US] is approved or recommended for preventing **schizophrenia relapse**. Relapse prevention relies on **antipsychotics** [^116emwcg] [^1113Tj5s], particularly long-acting injectables [^113Qe4hb] [^112aW9Zw] and clozapine [^114BxJu6] for treatment-resistant cases [^1177pDPa]. Kinase inhibitors such as everolimus [^116e2WSZ], gilteritinib [^115BrQZ8], and dasatinib [^114hHmVK] are oncology agents with no evidence or indication for schizophrenia relapse prevention. Current guidelines likewise do not support kinase inhibitors for this purpose [^113Qe4hb].

## Evidence for kinase inhibitors in schizophrenia relapse prevention

- **Everolimus**: An mTOR inhibitor approved for oncology and tuberous sclerosis; no evidence or indication for schizophrenia relapse prevention [^116e2WSZ].

- **Gilteritinib**: A FLT3 inhibitor approved for relapsed/refractory AML; no evidence or indication for schizophrenia relapse prevention [^115BrQZ8].

- **Dasatinib**: A BCR-ABL/SRC inhibitor approved for Ph+ leukemias; no evidence or indication for schizophrenia relapse prevention [^114hHmVK].

---

## Current clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines emphasize **antipsychotic maintenance therapy** [^1113Tj5s], with long-acting injectables for adherence [^113Qe4hb] [^112aW9Zw] and clozapine for treatment resistance [^114BxJu6]. There is no guideline support for kinase inhibitors in schizophrenia relapse prevention [^1113Tj5s].

---

## Conclusion

No kinase inhibitor is approved or recommended for preventing **schizophrenia relapse**. Relapse prevention is achieved with antipsychotic maintenance therapy [^113h1BWX] [^115PUku3] [^114KCpz7], particularly long-acting injectables and clozapine for treatment-resistant cases [^113Qe4hb] [^114BxJu6].

### Clozaril [^114BxJu6]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Clozaril is an atypical antipsychotic indicated for treatment-resistant schizophrenia and for reducing suicidal behavior in patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. Efficacy was established in active-controlled studies.

- **Indications and usage**: Clozaril is indicated for the treatment of severely ill patients with schizophrenia who fail to respond adequately to standard antipsychotic treatment. Due to the risks of severe neutropenia and seizures, Clozaril should be used only in such patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.5)].

The effectiveness of Clozaril in treatment-resistant schizophrenia was demonstrated in a 6-week, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled study comparing Clozaril and chlorpromazine in patients who had failed other antipsychotics [see Clinical Studies (14.1)].

- **Reduction in the risk of suicidal behavior in schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder**: Clozaril is indicated for reducing the risk of suicidal behavior in patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder who are judged to be at chronic risk based on history and recent clinical state. Suicidal behavior refers to actions by a patient that put themselves at risk for death. The effectiveness of Clozaril in reducing the risk of suicidal behavior was demonstrated over a two-year period.

Regarding the medical management of schizophrenia, the BAP 2020 guidelines specifically address the use of long-acting injectable antipsychotics. It is recommended to consider offering a long-acting injectable antipsychotic when monitoring medication adherence or avoiding non-adherence is a priority, when previous non-adherence has led to frequent relapses, or if it is preferred by the patient for convenience.

### Xospata [^115BrQZ8]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

- **Mechanism of action**: Gilteritinib is a small molecule that inhibits multiple receptor tyrosine kinases, including FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3). It demonstrated the ability to inhibit FLT3 receptor signaling and proliferation in cells exogenously expressing FLT3, including FLT3-ITD, tyrosine kinase domain mutations (TKD) FLT3-D835Y, and FLT3-ITD-D835Y. Additionally, it induced apoptosis in leukemic cells expressing FLT3-ITD.

- **Pharmacodynamics**: In patients with relapsed or refractory AML administered gilteritinib at 120 mg, substantial (> 90%) inhibition of FLT3 phosphorylation was rapid (within 24 hours after the first dose) and sustained, as characterized by an ex vivo plasma inhibitory activity (PIA) assay.

- **Cardiac electrophysiology**: The effect of Xospata at 120 mg once a day on the QTc interval has been evaluated in patients, showing an absence of large mean increases (i.e. 20 msec) in the QTc interval. Of 317 patients with a post-baseline QTc measurement on treatment with gilteritinib at 120 mg in clinical trials, 4 patients (1.3%) experienced a QTcF > 500 msec. Additionally, across all doses, 2.3% of patients with relapsed/refractory AML had a maximum post-baseline QTcF interval > 500 msec [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

### Afinitordisperz [^116e2WSZ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Mechanism of action**: Everolimus is an inhibitor of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), a serine-threonine kinase, downstream of the PI3K/AKT pathway. The mTOR pathway is dysregulated in several human cancers and in the tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). Everolimus binds to an intracellular protein, FKBP-12, resulting in an inhibitory complex formation with mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and thus inhibits mTOR kinase activity. It reduces the activity of S6 ribosomal protein kinase (S6K1) and eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein (4E-BP1), which are downstream effectors of mTOR involved in protein synthesis. S6K1 is a substrate of mTORC1 and phosphorylates the activation domain 1 of the estrogen receptor, resulting in ligand-independent activation of the receptor. Additionally, everolimus inhibits the expression of hypoxia-inducible factor (e.g. HIF-1) and reduces the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Inhibition of mTOR by everolimus has been shown to reduce cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and glucose uptake in both in vitro and in vivo studies.

Constitutive activation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway can contribute to endocrine resistance in breast cancer. In vitro studies show that estrogen-dependent and HER2+ breast cancer cells are sensitive to the inhibitory effects of everolimus. Combined treatment with everolimus and Akt, HER2, or aromatase inhibitors enhances the antitumor activity of everolimus in a synergistic manner.

Two regulators of mTORC1 signaling are the oncogene suppressors tuberin-sclerosis complexes 1 and 2.

### Dasatinib crosses the blood-brain barrier and is an efficient therapy for central nervous system Philadelphia chromosome-positive leukemia [^114hHmVK]. Blood (2008). High credibility.

Although imatinib, a BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitor, is used to treat acute Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph(+)) leukemia, it does not prevent central nervous system (CNS) relapses due to poor drug penetration through the blood-brain barrier. Imatinib and dasatinib (a dual-specific SRC/BCR-ABL kinase inhibitor) were compared in a preclinical mouse model of intracranial Ph(+) leukemia. Clinical dasatinib treatment in patients with CNS Ph(+) leukemia was assessed.

In preclinical studies, dasatinib increased survival, whereas imatinib failed to inhibit intracranial tumor growth. Stabilization and regression of CNS disease were achieved with continued dasatinib administration. The drug demonstrated substantial activity in 11 adult and pediatric patients with CNS Ph(+) leukemia. Eleven evaluable patients had clinically significant, long-lasting responses, which were complete in 7 patients.

In 3 additional patients, isolated CNS relapse occurred during dasatinib therapy; in 2 of them, it was caused by the expansion of a BCR-ABL-mutated dasatinib-resistant clone, implying selection pressure exerted by the compound in the CNS. Dasatinib shows promising therapeutic potential in managing intracranial leukemic disease and substantial clinical activity in patients who experience CNS relapse while on imatinib therapy.

### Predicting psychotic relapse following randomised discontinuation of paliperidone in individuals with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder: An individual participant data analysis [^113kpACd]. The Lancet Psychiatry (2023). High credibility.

Predicting relapse for individuals with psychotic disorders is not well established, especially after discontinuation of antipsychotic treatment. We aimed to identify general prognostic factors of relapse for all participants, irrespective of treatment continuation or discontinuation, and specific predictors of relapse for treatment discontinuation using machine learning.

- **Methods**: For this individual participant data analysis, we searched the Yale University Open Data Access Project's database for placebo-controlled, randomised antipsychotic discontinuation trials with participants with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder (aged ≥ 18 years). We included studies where participants were treated with any antipsychotic study drug and randomly assigned to either continue the same antipsychotic drug or discontinue it and receive a placebo. We assessed 36 prespecified baseline variables at randomisation to predict time to relapse, using univariate and multivariate proportional hazard regression models (including multivariate treatment group by variable interactions) with machine learning to categorise the variables as general prognostic factors of relapse, specific predictors of relapse, or both.

- **Findings**: We identified 414 trials, of which five trials with 700 participants (304 [43%] women and 396 [57%] men) were eligible for the continuation group and 692 participants (292 [42%] women and 400 [58%] men) were eligible for the discontinuation group. The median age was 37 years (IQR 28–47) for the continuation group and 38 years (IQR 28–47) for the discontinuation group. Out of the 36 prespecified baseline variables evaluated, specific factors.

### A method for tapering antipsychotic treatment that may minimize the risk of relapse [^111vu2Gk]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2021). Low credibility.

Given that reduced antagonism of D2 dopaminergic receptors has been implicated in many of the withdrawal phenomena attributed to antipsychotics, including psychotic symptoms, we suggest that tapering regimes should aim to reduce D2 receptor antagonism in a linear fashion. Adequate time should be provided between dose reductions to allow for adaptation to lower doses of the drug. This approach may produce more "evenly spread" perturbations to the system, which may minimize withdrawal-associated effects. Linear decrements of, for example, 10 percentage points of D2 receptor occupancy from 90% for haloperidol require hyperbolic dose reductions, as detailed in Table 3b and decrements of 20 percentage points in Figure 2c. Further medications are shown in Table 4 and supplementary tables S3–S11.

- **Pharmacologically informed tapering regimens for 6 antipsychotics**: See Table 4.

- **Theoretical representation of abrupt vs. gradual reduction of antipsychotic dose**:
	- (A) Untreated schizophrenia is represented by postsynaptic D2 receptors (open circles). Antipsychotics cause blockade of D2 receptors (filled-in circles). Chronic treatment is hypothesized to cause the upregulation of D2 receptors.
	- (B) Abrupt cessation of antipsychotic causes a large increase in dopaminergic transmission in sensitized D2 receptors, possibly associated with an increased risk of relapse.
	- (C) (i) Gradual reduction in antipsychotic dose leads to incrementally increased dopaminergic transmission, possibly associated with a smaller increase in the risk of relapse or temporary increase in symptom severity.

### Targeted treatment of schizophrenia symptoms as they manifest, or continuous treatment to reduce the risk of psychosis recurrence [^116WA2RJ]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2024). Low credibility.

Placebo-controlled trials supporting maintenance treatment typically last 6–12 months, which may be too short to be informative for an illness with a lifetime course. Supporting this assertion is a trial showing that psychosis was less likely to worsen in patients allocated to continued maintenance treatment in the short run, but social functioning worsened in the long run due to maintenance treatment. The discontinuation of antipsychotics might also produce withdrawal effects beyond supersensitivity, such as insomnia, which could contribute to psychosis exacerbation by itself. Additionally, patients released from the sedating effects of antipsychotics might appear agitated to the untrained eye, hence being misdiagnosed as having exacerbated symptoms.

Unlike randomized controlled trials (RCTs), intermittent or targeted treatment studies typically last several years. However, despite efforts to design the most valid studies within the constraints of very long-term follow-up and significant drop-out rates, such studies have inevitable methodological weaknesses. Because some of the follow-up studies did not use a random assignment design, the possibility that the results are confounded by indication cannot be ruled out. It is possible that less severely ill patients at baseline were included in the intermittent or no treatment group, raising concerns about reverse causality. However, even if that is the case, it demonstrates that a subgroup of about 30% of patients diagnosed with schizophrenia does not experience psychotic symptoms in the absence of antipsychotic drugs.

### Relapse prevention through health technology program reduces hospitalization in schizophrenia [^117CHLNV]. Psychological Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Psychiatric hospitalization is a major driver of cost in the treatment of schizophrenia. In this study, we asked whether a technology-enhanced approach to relapse prevention could reduce days spent in a hospital after discharge.

- **Methods**: The Improving Care and Reducing Cost (ICRC) study was a quasi-experimental clinical trial conducted between 26 February 2013 and 17 April 2015 at 10 different sites in the United States. This study was conducted in an outpatient setting and included patients aged 18 to 60 years with a diagnosis of schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or psychotic disorder not otherwise specified. Patients received either usual care or a technology-enhanced relapse prevention program during a 6-month period after discharge. The health technology program included in-person, individualized relapse prevention planning with treatments delivered via smartphones and computers, as well as a web-based prescriber decision support program. The main outcome measure was the number of days spent in a psychiatric hospital during the 6 months after discharge.

- **Results**: The study included 462 patients, of which 438 had complete baseline data and were thus used for propensity matching and analysis. Control participants (N = 89; 37 females) were enrolled first and received usual care for relapse prevention, followed by 349 participants (128 females) who received technology-enhanced relapse prevention. During the 6-month follow-up, 43% of control and 24% of intervention participants were hospitalized (χ² = 11.76, p < 0.001). Days of hospitalization were reduced by 5 days (mean days: b = -4.58; 95% CI).

### Evidence-based guidelines for the pharmacological treatment of schizophrenia: Updated recommendations from the British Association for Psychopharmacology [^113kJejz]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2020). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for schizophrenia, and more specifically with respect to maintenance therapy, the BAP 2020 guidelines recommend deciding on the duration of maintenance therapy jointly by the clinician and patient. This decision should take into account the advantages and disadvantages of withdrawing versus continuing medication, including the risk of relapse and medication side effects. It is advised to consider the characteristics of the index episode, such as speed of onset, insight, severity, and associated risk, to assess the risks associated with any future relapse.

### Phosphoproteomic profiling of T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia reveals targetable kinases and combination treatment strategies [^112HsfB9]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

The identification of new targeted drugs is urgently needed to prevent relapses, overcome therapy resistance, and avoid excessive toxicities for T-ALL patients. Genomic-guided therapy has thus far not led to the wide implementation of targeted agents in T-ALL. However, protein analyses can provide useful insights for the identification of cellular dependencies that translate into targetable leukemia vulnerabilities. In this study, we performed an exploratory, global, unbiased phosphoproteome profiling to identify targetable kinases in T-ALL and to establish a proteome platform that can complement genomic analyses for the investigation of leukemia dependencies.

In our initial analysis of 11 T-ALL cell lines, we identified highly active tyrosine kinases: LCK, SRC, FYN, YES1, LYN, INSR, and IGF-1R, as well as serine/threonine kinases: CDK1/2, AKT, and PAK1/2. Moreover, the comparison of the phosphoproteomes of T-ALL and AML revealed active kinases that reflect differences in their hematopoietic lineages of origin, independently of the presence of known signaling mutations. This highlights the additional value of MS-based phosphoproteome profiling.

Next, we screened several clinical kinase inhibitors in vitro and found that the CDK1/CDK2 inhibitor milciclib has a cytostatic effect in T-ALL cells. Milciclib is under clinical investigation for the treatment of thymoma and hepatocellular carcinoma. Currently, clinical studies are investigating other CDK inhibitors, such as ribociclib and palbociclib, for the treatment of relapsed T-ALL, and milciclib may be an additional treatment option.

### Comparative effectiveness of antipsychotic treatment strategies for relapse prevention in first-episode schizophrenia in Finland: A population-based cohort study [^114DUmqS]. The Lancet Psychiatry (2025). Low credibility.

Our findings challenge the treatment guidelines recommending clozapine as a third-line treatment, resulting in treatment practices characterized by long delays to clozapine initiation. When a person with first-episode schizophrenia experiences a first psychosis relapse despite the use of non-clozapine oral antipsychotics, continuation with the same antipsychotic or a switch to another non-clozapine oral antipsychotic is not beneficial in relapse prevention. Instead, clozapine initiation should be considered as part of shared decision-making with the person with schizophrenia and their carers.

There is no established treatment algorithm (i.e. a step-by-step guide for which antipsychotic should be chosen) for patients who have relapsed despite ongoing antipsychotic treatment. Possible options are to continue with the same antipsychotic that was used before the relapse, switch to another oral antipsychotic, switch to a long-acting injectable antipsychotic, or consider antipsychotic polypharmacy. Clozapine is the most efficacious antipsychotic, but due to safety problems, treatment guidelines state that at least two other antipsychotics should be tried before switching to clozapine. In addition, there are prescriber-related and organizational barriers for clozapine use, which requires regular blood monitoring. Thus far, only one study has been published on the comparative effectiveness of different antipsychotic switching strategies in first-episode schizophrenia. The results of this 32-week trial showed that switching from a first non-clozapine anti…

### Effectiveness of information technology aided relapse prevention programme in schizophrenia excluding the effect of user adherence: a randomized controlled trial [^114Gmx1v]. Schizophrenia Research (2013). Low credibility.

A relapse prevention program called the Information Technology Aided Relapse Prevention Programme in Schizophrenia (ITAREPS) has been developed and is reported to be highly effective. However, the effectiveness was influenced by user adherence to the protocol of the program, and the exact effectiveness and the role of the ITAREPS have been partially uncertain.

- **Objective**: The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the ITAREPS excluding the effect of user adherence to the protocol of the program.

- **Method**: We attempted to perform a randomized controlled trial by the devised method with visiting nurse service. Outpatients with schizophrenia were randomized to the ITAREPS (n = 22) or control group (n = 23) and were observed for 12 months.

- **Results**: The risk of rehospitalization was reduced in the ITAREPS group (2 [9.1%]) compared with the control group (8 [34.8%]) (hazard ratio = 0.21, 95% CI 0.04–0.99, p = 0.049; number needed to treat (NNT) = 4, 95% CI 2.1–35.5). The mean number of inpatient days was significantly lower in the ITAREPS group (18.5 days) compared with the control group (88.8 days) (p = 0.036). The ratio of the number of rehospitalizations to that of relapses was significantly lower (p = 0.035) and the mean change in total BPRS scores at relapse from baseline was significantly less in the ITAREPS group (p = 0.019).

- **Conclusions**: The relapse prevention effectiveness of the ITAREPS was high, and we confirmed that the ITAREPS, i.e. detecting signs of relapse and increasing medication during the warning state, is an effective intervention during the early…

### Guideline for the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia [^111cipXv]. British Journal of Haematology (2022). High credibility.

Concerning follow-up and surveillance for chronic lymphocytic leukemia, particularly in the management of relapsed or refractory disease, the BSH 2022 guidelines recommend offering targeted inhibitors, such as Bruton TKI or BCL-2 inhibitor alone or in combination with rituximab, as the treatment of choice for patients with relapsed CLL.

### Seroquel XR [^115PUku3]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

In a longer-term trial (Study 3), clinically stable adult outpatients (n = 171) meeting DSM-IV criteria for schizophrenia who remained stable following 16 weeks of open-label treatment with flexible doses of Seroquel XR (400 mg/day-800 mg/day) were randomized to placebo or continued on their Seroquel XR (400 mg/day-800 mg/day) for observation for possible relapse during the double-blind continuation (maintenance) phase. Stabilization during the open-label phase was defined as receiving a stable dose of Seroquel XR and having a CGI-S ≤ 4 and a PANSS score ≤ 60 from beginning to end of this open-label phase (with no increase of ≥ 10 points in PANSS total score). Relapse during the double-blind phase was defined in terms of a ≥ 30% increase in the PANSS total score, or CGI-Improvement score of ≥ 6, or hospitalization due to the worsening of schizophrenia, or need for any other antipsychotic medication. Patients on Seroquel XR experienced a statistically significant longer time to relapse than did patients on placebo.

### VA/DoD clinical practice guideline for management of first-episode psychosis and schizophrenia [^115F29cx]. VA/DoD (2023). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for schizophrenia, specifically in the context of maintenance therapy, the 2023 DoD/VA guidelines recommend continuing antipsychotic therapy to prevent relapse and hospitalization in patients with schizophrenia who respond to treatment. The choice of antipsychotic medication should be based on an individualized evaluation of patient characteristics and the side effect profiles of different medications.

### Choosing an optimal antipsychotic dose for relapse prevention [^117MPwPD]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2022). Low credibility.

Taipale et al. investigated the optimal antipsychotic dose for the maintenance treatment of schizophrenia by linking the Hospital Discharge Registry of Finland with the prescription register from 1995 to 2017. They estimated doses for each prescribing period, classifying them into the WHO Defined Daily Dose (DDD) categories: < 0.6, 0.6–0.9, 0.9–1.1, 1.1–1.4, 1.4–1.6, and ≥ 1.6. The DDD was developed as a tool for drug utilization research, reflecting common doses used to treat schizophrenia, with 1 DDD unit being an average dose (e.g. 10 mg of olanzapine is 1 DDD unit; 0.6 DDD is 6 mg; 1.6 DDD is 16 mg). The DDD corresponds approximately to efficacious doses found in short-term trials of schizophrenia.

The analysis estimated the rate of relapse, using within-subject Cox regression, occurring at the various doses in DDD units. Relapse was defined as rehospitalization. Each analysis was restricted to patients who received monotherapy with one of the 15 antipsychotics and had several relapses preceded by different maintenance doses. Compared to nonuse of antipsychotics within the same individual, 13 of the 15 antipsychotics investigated showed a U- or J-shaped dose-response curve, usually with the best prevention of relapse at 0.9–1.1 DDD. The lowest preventive effect was seen at the highest dose (1.6 DDD or greater). An increase in relapses was also observed with the lowest dose (less than 0.6 DDD units) for some drugs.

### Evidence-based guidelines for the pharmacological treatment of schizophrenia: Updated recommendations from the British Association for Psychopharmacology [^1152Rib7]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2020). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of schizophrenia, particularly concerning the initiation of antipsychotic therapy, the BAP 2020 guidelines recommend using high-dose or combined antipsychotic medication regimens for treatment-refractory schizophrenia as a limited therapeutic trial. It is crucial to closely monitor side effects and therapeutic response. High doses should be continued beyond three months only if there is a clear clinical benefit that outweighs the risks.

### Crossroads of methodological choices in research synthesis: Insights from two network meta-analyses on preventing relapse in schizophrenia [^116emwcg]. BMJ Mental Health (2023). High credibility.

Pharmacological prevention of relapse in schizophrenia is a debated topic. Recently, two different research groups attempted to address this relevant clinical issue by synthesizing data from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) using network meta-analysis (NMA) methodology. In this contribution, jointly written by some of the researchers involved in both NMAs, similarities and differences of these two approaches are examined to discuss how different methodological choices can be applied to the same clinical problem and whether they contributed to differences in results and conclusions.

- **Technical issues of NMAs**: We critically appraised some of the technical issues of NMAs, exemplified in these two NMAs, suggesting possible future developments.

### Comparative effectiveness of antipsychotic treatment strategies for relapse prevention in first-episode schizophrenia in Finland: A population-based cohort study [^1177pDPa]. The Lancet Psychiatry (2025). High credibility.

Using the national registry of Finland, we investigated the comparative effectiveness of different treatment strategies in relapse prevention before and after the first relapse in people with first-episode schizophrenia. Compared with continuing the same treatment strategy used before the first relapse, switching to clozapine was always associated with the lowest risk of a second relapse. The adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) for second relapse for a switch from non-clozapine oral antipsychotic monotherapy to clozapine was 0.66 (95% CI 0.49–0.88), for a switch from non-use to clozapine 0.52 (0.41–0.65), and for a switch from non-clozapine oral antipsychotic polypharmacy 0.30 (0.16–0.56).

For non-clozapine oral antipsychotic monotherapies, a switch to another non-clozapine oral antipsychotic monotherapy was not associated with decreased relapse risk (0.99, 0.76–1.28). Switching from other antipsychotics to clozapine was associated with a decreased risk of relapse, but switching from clozapine to other oral antipsychotics was associated with an increased risk of relapse (2.19, 1.39–3.45), indicating that the order of switches was not the pivotal factor for treatment success; instead, clozapine use itself was crucial.

Our study provides, to our knowledge, the first evidence for the comparative effectiveness of antipsychotic switch strategies among people having their first schizophrenia relapse. It shows that although switching from one oral non-clozapine antipsychotic to another was not associated with a decrease in relapse risk, a switch to clozapine was associated with a 34% (95% CI 12–51) reduced risk of relapse.

### Mental health gap action programme (mhGAP) guideline for mental, neurological and substance use disorders [Internet] [^113Qe4hb]. Geneva: World Health Organization (2023). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for schizophrenia, specifically with respect to long-acting injectable antipsychotics, the WHO 2023 guidelines recommend considering a long-acting injectable antipsychotic (such as fluphenazine, haloperidol, paliperidone, risperidone, or zuclopenthixol) as an alternative to oral antipsychotics in adult patients with psychotic disorders, including schizophrenia, requiring long-term treatment. The recommendation emphasizes carefully balancing effectiveness, side effects, and individual preferences.

### Chronic treatment with aripiprazole prevents development of dopamine supersensitivity and potentially supersensitivity psychosis [^116LisKt]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2012). Low credibility.

In the present study, we found that chronic treatment with aripiprazole (ARI) did not induce behavioral supersensitivity. This result may have been due to the maintenance of stable striatal D2 receptor density, in accordance with the findings of a previous study. Interestingly, we also observed that chronic treatment with ARI reduced the dopamine supersensitivity previously induced by chronic haloperidol (HAL) treatment, as determined based on both behavioral testing and D2 receptor density. In other words, ARI left baseline dopamine sensitivity intact in drug-naive rats, while it reduced sensitivity in rats that had already developed supersensitivity.

Although it was already known that chronic exposure to agonists often induces desensitization that correlates with a decrease in the number of targeted receptors, ARI did not induce desensitization in drug-naive rats. One explanation for these results could be related to compensatory systems of dopamine neurotransmission. Although it is still controversial whether ARI is a D2 receptor partial agonist, ARI is thought to possess some dopamine agonistic activity. Hence, in drug-naive rats, ARI allows for natural dopaminergic neurotransmission, and such compensatory functioning may not be involved. On the other hand, in supersensitive rats, ARI yields excessive dopaminergic neurotransmission due to increased D2 receptor density, and thus compensatory systems may be induced, which in turn would reduce D2 receptor density, as suggested in the present study. In other words, ARI may stabilize sensitivity to dopamine by regulating compensatory systems of dopamine neurotransmission.

### Is the ongoing use of placebo in relapse-prevention clinical trials in schizophrenia justified [^112vgPmY]. Schizophrenia Research (2013). Low credibility.

Placebo-controlled randomised controlled trials (RCTs) continue to be required or recommended by regulatory authorities for the licensing of new drugs for schizophrenia, despite ongoing concerns regarding the risks to trial participants.

- **Methods**: In this article, we consider the scientific and ethical pros and cons associated with the use of placebo in RCTs in schizophrenia. We systematically review the published relapse-prevention placebo-controlled RCTs with second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs) in schizophrenia and examine the risks associated with these trials.

- **Results**: We identified 12 studies involving 2,842 participants, of which 968 received placebo. Relapse rates were 56% for placebo and 17.4% for active treatment groups. There is a lack of well-designed longitudinal studies investigating the psychosocial and biological consequences of exposure to placebo, treatment discontinuation, and relapse in schizophrenia.

- **Conclusion**: In the absence of such studies, it is risky to assume that patients are not at risk of significant distress and long-term harm, and therefore it is difficult to justify the ongoing use of placebo in relapse-prevention RCTs in schizophrenia.

### Choosing an optimal antipsychotic dose for relapse prevention [^112CAd3E]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2022). Low credibility.

In a companion study, the Tiihonen group applied the same DDD (Defined Daily Dose) categories for all antipsychotics as a class, providing a more comprehensive dose analysis. This approach was necessary because patients could be on monotherapy with different antipsychotics at different times or concurrently (polypharmacy). The researchers analyzed data starting from the first episode of schizophrenia and followed up for about 5 years. Forty-three percent of patients did not have a relapse, while 57% experienced one or more relapses. The dose prescribed to those who relapsed was increased over time and in cases of multiple relapses.

Compared to nonuse of antipsychotics, virtually all doses prevented relapses. A U-shaped dose–response curve was observed for individuals with one or two relapses. There was a poor relapse preventive effect with doses of less than 0.6 DDD, the best preventive effect at doses of 0.9–1.1 DDD, a fair preventive effect with doses from 1.4–1.6 DDD, and a very poor preventive effect at 2.4 or more DDD units. For those with three or more relapses, the best preventive effects were at 1.4–1.6 DDD units, the next best with 0.9–1.1 DDD units, fair preventive effects up to 2.4 DDD units, but poor effects at doses of 2.4 DDD or greater.

### Predicting relapse in schizophrenia: Is BDNF a plausible biological marker [^115MoE3p]. Schizophrenia Research (2018). Low credibility.

Understanding the biological processes that underlie why patients relapse is an issue of fundamental importance to the detection and prevention of relapse in schizophrenia. Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF), a facilitator of brain plasticity, is reduced in patients with schizophrenia. In the present study, we examined whether decreases in plasma BDNF levels could be used as a biological predictor of relapse in schizophrenia.

A total of 221 patients were prospectively evaluated for relapse over 30 months in the Preventing Relapse in Schizophrenia: Oral Antipsychotics Compared to Injectables: Evaluating Efficacy (PROACTIVE) study. Serial blood samples were collected at a maximum of 23 time points during the 30-month trial, and BDNF levels were measured in plasma samples by ELISA. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve analysis indicated that BDNF was not a significant predictor of relapse, hospitalization or exacerbation. Regardless of treatment group (oral second-generation antipsychotic vs. long-acting injectable risperidone microspheres), baseline BDNF value did not differ significantly between those who experienced any of the adverse outcomes and those who did not.

While contrary to the study hypothesis, these robust results offer little support for the use of plasma BDNF alone as a biomarker to predict relapse in schizophrenia.

### A method for tapering antipsychotic treatment that may minimize the risk of relapse [^113Lx8Ds]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2021). Low credibility.

Distinguishing withdrawal-associated psychosis in patients with schizophrenia from the endogenous relapse of a psychotic illness is difficult. Withdrawal-associated relapse has been thought to be characterized by early onset following the elimination of medication and association with other evidence of withdrawal, including motor symptoms.

The strongest evidence for the existence of withdrawal-associated relapse is the preponderance of relapses that occur in the weeks and months following cessation. Relapses are not distributed evenly across time but tend to occur predominantly around the point of drug cessation. This is emphasized by comparing studies of abrupt withdrawal to a study in which patients were tapered off antipsychotics more slowly (over up to 18 months). In the latter scenario, relapses are much more evenly distributed across time, without the same degree of clustering that occurs in studies where antipsychotics are stopped quickly. This pattern is understandable because there should conceivably be no systematic correlation between the times at which different patients relapse.

Some have suggested that the reason relapse rates are higher in the first few months following drug cessation, and then gradually reduce, is because there are fewer patients "available" to relapse as time goes on, given that they have already relapsed. However, the marked increase in relapse rates that occurs following drug discontinuation cannot be explained by simple attrition of patients over time; the clustering of relapses around the point of discontinuation suggests there's more to the phenomenon.

### Abilify [^113h1BWX]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

The efficacy of 10 mg, 15 mg, 20 mg, and 30 mg daily doses was established in two studies for each dose. Among these doses, there was no evidence that the higher dose groups offered any advantage over the lowest dose group.

An examination of population subgroups did not reveal any clear evidence of differential responsiveness on the basis of age, gender, or race.

A longer-term trial enrolled 310 inpatients or outpatients meeting DSM-IV criteria for schizophrenia who were, by history, symptomatically stable on other antipsychotic medications for periods of 3 months or longer. These patients were discontinued from their antipsychotic medications and randomized to Abilify 15 mg/day or placebo for up to 26 weeks of observation for relapse. Relapse during the double-blind phase was defined as a CGI-Improvement score of ≥ 5 (minimally worse), scores ≥ 5 (moderately severe) on the hostility or uncooperativeness items of the PANSS, or a ≥ 20% increase in the PANSS total score. Patients receiving Abilify 15 mg/day experienced a significantly longer time to relapse over the subsequent 26 weeks compared to those receiving placebo (Study 5 in Figure 6).

- **Pediatric patients**: The efficacy of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia in pediatric patients (13 to 17 years of age) was evaluated in one 6-week, placebo-controlled trial of outpatients who met DSM-IV criteria for schizophrenia and had a PANSS score ≥ 70 at baseline. In this trial (n = 302), comparing two fixed doses of Abilify (10 or 30 mg/day) to placebo, Abilify was titrated starting from 2 mg/day to the target.

### Targeted treatment of schizophrenia symptoms as they manifest, or continuous treatment to reduce the risk of psychosis recurrence [^1172B9tp]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2024). Low credibility.

Pharmacological treatment of schizophrenia employs drugs that interfere with dopamine neurotransmission, aiming to suppress acute exacerbation of psychosis and maintain treatment to reduce the risk of psychosis recurrence. According to this treatment scheme, available psychotropic drugs intended to treat negative symptoms, cognitive impairment, or anxiety are administered as add-ons to treatment with antipsychotics.

However, an alternative treatment scheme proposes a targeted or intermittent treatment approach, by which antipsychotic drugs are administered upon psychosis exacerbation and discontinued upon remission or stabilization. Meanwhile, negative symptoms, cognitive impairment, or anxiety are treated with specific psychotropics as monotherapy. Along these lines, antipsychotics are renewed only in the event of recurrence of psychotic symptoms.

This 50-year-old debate between targeted and continuous treatment schemes arises from disagreements about interpreting scientific evidence and discordant views regarding benefit/risk assessment. Among the debate's questions are:

1. What is the percentage of individuals who can maintain stability without antipsychotic maintenance treatment, and what is the percentage of those who exacerbate despite antipsychotic treatment?
2. How to interpret results of placebo-controlled 9- to 18-month-long maintenance trials in a lifelong chronic disorder, and how to interpret results of the targeted trials, some of which are open-label or not randomized?
3. How to weigh the decreased risk for psychotic recurrence vs the almost…

### Maintenance ECT in schizophrenia: A systematic review [^113w2DYk]. Psychiatry Research (2018). Low credibility.

Relapse after discontinuation of ECT is significant in patients with schizophrenia. The purpose of this systematic review was to examine the use of M-ECT in schizophrenia to guide clinical decision-making for relapse prevention. We reviewed studies examining the role of continuation (C-ECT) and maintenance electroconvulsive therapy (M-ECT) in schizophrenia. Following PRISMA guidelines, we included randomized controlled trials, open-label trials, retrospective chart reviews, case reports, and case series in this review. We evaluated adjunctive pharmacological regimens and ECT treatment parameters, including frequency, duration of continued treatment, and electrode placement. Clinical outcomes included cognitive side effects and relapse rates from included studies. Our findings suggest M-ECT could provide an effective form of relapse prevention in these patients, and persistent cognitive side effects are minimal.

### Predicting individual improvement in schizophrenia symptom severity at 1-year follow-up: Comparison of connectomic, structural, and clinical predictors [^1111M7pm]. Human Brain Mapping (2020). Low credibility.

While many individuals with schizophrenia can achieve varying degrees of remission, the risk of relapse, recurrence, and worsening of symptoms remains significant, particularly after treatment discontinuation. Relapse may indicate disease progression, and in many cases, is accompanied by brain changes or serious consequences, including extreme despair and increased risk of suicide. Predicting relapse events and illness course is therefore critical to enable the early and targeted initiation of appropriate treatments to individuals with a high risk of relapse. Moreover, individuals predicted to follow a favorable illness course may be spared unnecessary treatment and associated side effects.

### Comparative effectiveness of antipsychotic treatment strategies for relapse prevention in first-episode schizophrenia in Finland: a population-based cohort study [^112wnEyi]. The Lancet Psychiatry (2025). High credibility.

Taken together, since studies have shown that the antipsychotic treatment response deteriorates markedly after the second relapse, which was also observed in this cohort, it seems that the treatment guidelines recommending clozapine as the third-line treatment lead to delayed use of clozapine and could lead to iatrogenic worsening of the person's schizophrenia. In addition, there is evidence that long delays in initiating clozapine after the emergence of treatment-resistant symptoms are associated with a decreased likelihood of optimal response.

- **Factors unrelated to the drug**: Factors associated with treatment other than a drug, such as frequent blood monitoring, might contribute to observed differences. However, closer clinical contact has not explained other benefits of clozapine treatment. The potential halo effects of blood monitoring versus potentially uniquely efficacious receptor binding profiles of clozapine could be interesting from a pharmacological point of view, but for the patients, their families, and those treating the patients, it is indifferent what component of the treatment explains the good outcome.

- **Uncertainty of treatment status**: The uncertainty of actual treatment status is higher for non-clozapine oral antipsychotic monotherapies and polypharmacy than for clozapine, long-acting injectables, and non-use. A subgroup of non-clozapine oral antipsychotic monotherapy and polypharmacy users might have abruptly discontinued antipsychotic treatment before first relapse.

Almost half of the patients in our cohort were not using any antipsychotic before their first relapse.

### Comparative effectiveness of antipsychotic treatment strategies for relapse prevention in first-episode schizophrenia in Finland: A population-based cohort study [^113roo1h]. The Lancet Psychiatry (2025). Low credibility.

The best pharmacological treatment practices for relapse prevention in patients with first-episode schizophrenia are unclear. We aimed to assess different treatment strategies used before and after the first relapse and their associations with subsequent relapse risk.

- **Methods**: In this population-based cohort study, we enrolled individuals (aged ≤ 45 years) with first-episode schizophrenia who were hospitalized and subsequently relapsed between 1996 and 2014 from the nationwide Finnish Hospital Discharge Register. Individuals who had not been taking antipsychotics within the year preceding initial hospitalization and who had a relapse within 5 years of discharge were included in the analyses. Treatment strategies were assessed during the 30 days before hospitalization for the first relapse and 30 days after discharge. These were categorized as long-acting injectable, clozapine, non-clozapine oral antipsychotic monotherapy, non-clozapine oral antipsychotic polypharmacy, and antipsychotic non-use. Adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) of the risk of second relapse based on treatment type were analyzed with Cox regression models for 2 years after the first relapse, or until death or end of data linkage (Dec 31, 2017). People with lived experience of schizophrenia were not involved in the research and writing process.

- **Findings**: Between Jan 31, 1996, and Dec 31, 2017, 3000 individuals had their first psychosis relapse and were eligible for analysis. The mean age was 30.0 years (SD 7.6), with 1069 (35.6%) of patients being women and 1931 (64.4%) men. No ethnicity data were available.

### Has research informed us on the practical drug treatment of schizophrenia [^117FyS9r]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2008). Low credibility.

- **Long-term changes and cost**: If a better drug is more efficacious than another drug in one or another domain, it may take a month or even years for this to translate into a measurable decrease in real-world outcomes, such as rehospitalizations, the ability to live in a less restricted setting, getting a job, quality of life, and changing medical costs. We do not have a valid methodology to address most of these questions. We have methods for determining the prevention of relapse using survival methodologies, but this does not help with the assessment of functional outcomes.

As each patient relapses, the once initially randomized samples become no longer randomized. Consequently, the groups become progressively different on the variable of interest. This confounds the findings of long-term studies. To illustrate with a thought experiment: suppose a treatment for a given cancer cured 90% and a 10-year follow-up was done on drug and placebo. Ten percent of the placebo-treated patients experienced spontaneous remission of the cancer, but 90% rapidly died; however, 90% of the drug-treated patients recovered and 10% died. The 90% on the drug and the 10% remitted on the placebo would be doing equally well for most of the 10 years. The cost of the placebo-treated group would be low because 90% died. Nothing saves medical costs like death. Outcome assessment would be meaningless because the groups are now nonrandom for most of the trial. This indicates a systematic error.

### Combination of a mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibitor with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor pacritinib combats cell adhesion-based residual disease and prevents re-expansion of FLT3-ITD acute myeloid leukaemia [^111c6oQx]. British Journal of Haematology (2020). Low credibility.

Minimal residual disease (MRD) in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) poses a major challenge due to drug insensitivity and high risk of relapse. Intensification of chemotherapy and stem cell transplantation are often pivoted on MRD status. Relapse rates are high even with the integration of first-generation FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) inhibitors in pre- and post-transplant regimes and as maintenance in FLT3-mutated AML. Pre-clinical progress is hampered by the lack of suitable modeling of residual disease and post-therapy relapse.

In the present study, we investigated the nature of pro-survival signaling in primary residual tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI)-treated AML cells adherent to stroma. We further determined their drug sensitivity in order to inform rational future therapy combinations. Using a primary human leukaemia-human stroma model to mimic the cell-cell interactions occurring in patients, we assessed the ability of several TKIs in clinical use to abrogate stroma-driven leukaemic signaling. A synergistic combination with a mitogen-activated protein kinase (MEK) inhibitor was identified for potential therapeutic application in the MRD setting. The findings reveal a common mechanism of stroma-mediated resistance that may be independent of mutational status but can be targeted through rational drug design to eradicate MRD and reduce treatment-related toxicity.

### Schizophrenia: Overview and treatment options [^111A7uWq]. P & T (2014). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on schizophrenia:

- **Definition**: Schizophrenia is defined as a complex psychiatric condition characterized by symptoms of delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech, and impaired cognitive functions.

- **Pathophysiology**: The exact cause of schizophrenia is unclear; however, in utero disorders (infections, obstetric complications, and fetal disturbances), as well as genetic and environmental factors (childhood trauma, social isolation, economic adversity, and discrimination), have been implicated.

- **Epidemiology**: The annual prevalence of diagnosed schizophrenia in the US is 5.1 per 1,000 individuals.

- **Disease course**: Abnormalities in neurotransmission (hypo/hyper) of neurotransmitters like dopamine, serotonin, and glutamate, particularly dopamine, result in either hyperdopaminergic function in the caudate nucleus or hypodopaminergic function in the frontal lobe. In addition, a complex interaction of nigrostriatal, mesolimbic, mesocortical, and tuberoinfundibular pathways leads to negative symptoms, positive symptoms, and cognitive deficits, alongside detectable physical changes in brain tissue.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: After a 10-year follow-up, 80% of schizophrenic patients require readmission after the first discharge. Non-adherence to antipsychotic medication in the first year is associated with a 64% relapse rate, while adherence during the first year is associated with a 27% relapse rate.

### Relapse prevention in schizophrenia with new-generation antipsychotics: A systematic review and exploratory meta-analysis of randomized, controlled trials [^112e5rLT]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2003). Low credibility.

The authors conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the potential of new-generation antipsychotic drugs in improving adherence and decreasing relapse rates in patients with schizophrenia.

- **Method**: Randomized, controlled trials comparing new-generation antipsychotic drugs with placebo and/or conventional antipsychotics were identified. Data on relapse, general treatment failure, and dropout due to adverse events were extracted and combined in a meta-analysis.

- **Results**: Due to the limited number of trials available for each drug, the effects of new-generation antipsychotic drugs were analyzed collectively. The analysis, which included six placebo comparisons involving 983 patients, demonstrated that new-generation antipsychotic drugs are effective for relapse prevention. Eleven studies with a total of 2,032 patients provided comparative data on relapse/treatment failure for new-generation and conventional antipsychotics. Rates of relapse and overall treatment failure were modestly, yet significantly, lower with the newer drugs. It remains unclear whether this advantage was partly mediated by improved adherence. No significant superiority regarding fewer dropouts due to adverse events was observed for the newer drugs. Several methodological problems were identified.

- **Conclusions**: The available data suggest that new-generation antipsychotics have the potential to reduce relapse rates. Future trials should address methodological issues, including the choice of comparator.

### The evidence for illness progression after relapse in schizophrenia [^115ZydBc]. Schizophrenia Research (2013). Low credibility.

It has long been suspected that relapse in schizophrenia is associated with disease progression, as time to response becomes longer, negative and other symptoms persist, some patients become treatment refractory, and neuroprogression in terms of structural brain changes may occur. This article examines the evidence for illness progression after relapse in patients with schizophrenia. It reports on indirect evidence obtained from retrospective, naturalistic, and brain-imaging studies, as well as a few prospective studies examining pre- and post-relapse treatment response.

Findings suggest that the treatment response after relapse is variable, with many patients responding rapidly, others exhibiting protracted impairment of response, and a subgroup displaying emergent refractoriness. This subgroup comprises about 1 in 6 patients, irrespective of whether it is the first or a subsequent relapse, and even when the delay between onset of first symptoms of relapse and initiation of treatment is brief. While there is a lack of well-designed studies investigating the post-relapse treatment outcome, available evidence gives sufficient cause for concern that, in addition to the considerable psychosocial risks, an additional risk of biological harm may be associated with relapse.

### Iloperidone [^1127jFJr]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

A 4-week, placebo-controlled trial (n = 604) involved one fixed dose of iloperidone (24 mg/day) compared to placebo and an active control (ziprasidone). The titration schedule for this study was similar to that for the 6-week study. This study involved titration of iloperidone starting at 1 mg twice daily on Day 1 and increasing to 2 mg, 4 mg, 6 mg, 8 mg, 10 mg, and 12 mg twice daily on Days 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7. The primary endpoint was change from baseline on the PANSS total score at the end of treatment (Day 28). The 24 mg/day iloperidone dose was superior to placebo in the PANSS total score. Iloperidone tablets appeared to have similar efficacy to the active control drug, which also needed a slow titration to the target dose.

In a longer-term trial, clinically stable adult outpatients (n = 303) meeting DSM-IV criteria for schizophrenia who remained stable following 12 weeks of open-label treatment with flexible doses of iloperidone (8 mg/day to 24 mg/day administered as twice daily doses) were randomized to placebo or to continue on their iloperidone dose (8 mg/day to 24 mg/day administered as twice daily doses) for observation for possible relapse during the double-blind relapse prevention phase. Stabilization during the open-label phase was defined as being on an established dose of iloperidone that was unchanged due to efficacy in the 4 weeks prior to randomization, having a CGI-Severity score of ≤ 4 and PANSS total score ≤ 70, a score of ≤ 4 on each of the following individual PANSS items (P1-delusions, P2-conceptual disorganization, P3-hallucinatory behavior, P6-suspension).

### Later is not necessarily better: Limitations of survival analysis in studies of long-term drug treatment of psychiatric conditions [^1138XLNw]. BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Withdrawal effects in psychiatric trials

Trials of long-term treatment in psychiatry, including trials referred to as relapse prevention trials, employ a discontinuation design in which the withdrawal of previous treatment is compared with its continuation. Many trials of psychiatric drugs, including antipsychotics, antidepressants, and lithium, reveal that people randomized to switch to placebo or no treatment show a high rate of early relapse that declines over subsequent months or years. This high rate of early relapse is absent or less marked in those randomized to continue treatment, and hence there are substantial differences in relapse rates to begin with, which diminish over time, as demonstrated in meta-analyses of antipsychotic and antidepressant relapse prevention trials, for example.

The reasons for the high rate of early relapse are debated and several possibilities exist. It has been argued that it reflects a naturally high risk of relapse in some disorders, such as schizophrenia, but the untreated risk in most psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia, is not known. Where historical evidence exists, as in bipolar disorder, it suggests the underlying risk is lower than following discontinuation of drug treatment. In a chronic condition, early relapses might also represent the re-emergence of underlying symptoms previously suppressed by the drugs, but this is only likely to explain a small number of early relapses, since most people do not have severe, chronic symptoms and long-term medication is generally prescribed for prophylaxis.

### Treatment strategies to prevent relapse and encourage remission [^117KbiRJ]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2007). Low credibility.

Remission is a realistic goal for patients with schizophrenia, and if sustained remission without relapse can be achieved, then patients may attain functional recovery. With each relapse, recovery can be slowed, and the course of illness worsens. The risk of self-harm and harm to others increases with each psychotic episode. The chance of relapse is decreased if pharmacotherapy continues uninterrupted, and one strategy to ensure continuous treatment is using long-acting injectable antipsychotic medications. Achieving remission of schizophrenia is clinically meaningful because, besides symptom control, remission allows for improved vocational and social functioning. Functional recovery without relapse enables patients to return to work, sustain interpersonal relationships, and lead more productive lives. Therefore, achieving the goals of remission and recovery is in the best interest not only of patients with schizophrenia but also of society.

### Telephone-delivered psychosocial interventions targeting key health priorities in adults with a psychotic disorder: Systematic review [^1133xcJe]. Psychological Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

- **Participant characteristics**: Across all studies, the total number of participants was 2,473: 867 in relapse prevention, 1,273 in medication adherence, and 333 in smoking and/or other health risk behavior studies (see online Supplementary Table S1). The average age was 40.7 years, with 41.9 in relapse prevention, 39.5 in medication adherence, and 42.2 in smoking and/or other CVD risk behaviors. Overall, the percentage of males across the studies was 50.1%. However, there was a higher percentage of males in studies of schizophrenia samples (64.5%) compared to studies of bipolar (37.7%) and mixed samples (44.2%). No study used a first episode sample.

- **Study characteristics**: The 22 papers comprised a total of 20 trials, with Simon et al. reporting on the same study. There were 16 controlled and four single-arm studies. Nine trials recruited people with bipolar disorder, six with schizophrenia spectrum disorder, four with schizophrenia, and one with a range of diagnoses (see online Supplementary Table S1). For the RCTs, the telephone was the sole method of intervention delivery in one relapse prevention (Beebe) and three medication adherence trials (Salzer et al; Cook et al; Beebe et al.). For the studies without a comparison condition, the intervention was delivered entirely by telephone for two relapse prevention (Miklowitz et al; Boardman et al.) and one healthy lifestyle (Baker et al.) study.

### Predictors of lack of relapse after random discontinuation of oral and long-acting injectable antipsychotics in clinically stabilized patients with schizophrenia: A re-analysis of individual participant data [^115ugxji]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2022). Low credibility.

To quantify the risk and predictors of relapse among individuals with schizophrenia randomly withdrawn from antipsychotic maintenance treatment, we re-analyzed time-to-event and baseline predictors from placebo arms in five placebo-controlled randomized trials of antipsychotics (n = 688 individuals; 173 stabilized on oral antipsychotic [OAP] and 515 on long-acting injectables [LAI]) for relapse-prevention. The data was sourced from the Yale Open Data Access repository. Using survival and Cox-proportional hazards regression analyses, we estimated the survival rates of "relapse-free" individuals by the end of the follow-up period (median = 118 days, IQR = 52.0–208.0), the rate of study-confirmed relapse, and adjusted hazard ratios (aHR, 95% confidence intervals [CI]) associated with baseline predictors. We also estimated these parameters for individuals followed for more than five half-lives of the stabilizing antipsychotic and studied predictors of "rebound psychosis" in OAP-stabilized participants, defined as occurring within 30 days of antipsychotic withdrawal.

By the end of follow-up, 29.9% (95% CI = 23.2–38.5) remained relapse-free; 11.1% (95% CI = 5.65–21.9) among those OAP-stabilized and 36.4% (95% CI = 28.4–46.7) among those LAI-stabilized. The study-confirmed relapse rate was 45.2%, with 62.4% among those OAP-stabilized and 39.4% among those LAI-stabilized. Predictors of relapse included smoking (aHR = 1.54, 95% CI = 1.19–2.00), female sex (aHR = 1.37, 95% CI = 1.08–1.79), and having been stabilized on OAPs versus LAIs (aHR = 3.56, 95% CI = 2.68–4.72). The greater risk of relapse on OAP persisted.

### A randomized, controlled trial of omega-3 fatty acids plus an antioxidant for relapse prevention after antipsychotic discontinuation in first-episode schizophrenia [^114y2b7c]. Schizophrenia Research (2014). Low credibility.

While antipsychotics are effective in the maintenance treatment of schizophrenia, they have safety and tolerability risks. We investigated whether a combination of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (ω-3 PUFAs) and a metabolic antioxidant, alpha-lipoic acid (α-LA), is effective in preventing relapse after antipsychotic discontinuation in subjects who were successfully treated for 2–3 years following a first episode of schizophrenia, schizoaffective, or schizophreniform disorder.

- **Methods**: In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, antipsychotic treatment was tapered and discontinued. Participants received either ω-3 PUFAs (eicosapentaenoic acid 2g/day and docosahexaenoic acid 1g/day) + α-LA 300 mg/day or a placebo. Subjects were followed up for two years, or until relapse.

- **Results**: Recruitment was terminated prematurely due to the high relapse rates in both treatment groups as well as the severity of some of the relapse episodes. Of the 33 participants, 19 out of 21 (90%) randomized to ω-3 PUFAs + α-LA relapsed, and one (5%) completed two years without relapse (p = 0.6). Meanwhile, 9 out of 12 (75%) randomized to placebo relapsed, and none completed two years without relapse. Mean times to relapse were 39.8 ± 25.4 weeks for the ω-3 PUFAs + α-LA group and 38.3 ± 26.6 weeks for the placebo group (p = 0.9). There were no significant differences between the groups in terms of relapse symptom severity.

- **Conclusions**: We found no evidence that ω-3 PUFAs + α-LA could be a suitable alternative to maintenance antipsychotic treatment in relapse prevention in this small study. Antipsychotic discontinuation in this context led to a high relapse rate.

### Relapse prevention and recovery in the treatment of schizophrenia [^112583Ng]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2006). Low credibility.

Nonadherence to medication is a predictor of relapse in patients diagnosed with schizophrenia, and preventing relapse is crucial to achieving the goal of recovery. Long-term treatment with antipsychotics can be effective, although long-term patient response to medication may be difficult to predict from trials that measure response, remission, and relapse rates because they are often too short. Longer trials are needed to fully understand the implications of adherence and symptom remission in patient outcomes.

Recovery, however, is contingent on the stabilization of the symptoms of schizophrenia and the acquisition of the skills necessary to function in society. Psychosocial interventions, such as family psychoeducation, social skills training, and cognitive-behavioral therapy, used in conjunction with pharmacotherapy, are effective in helping to prevent symptom relapse and promote functional recovery in patients with schizophrenia.

### Metformin for the prevention of antipsychotic-induced weight gain: Guideline development and consensus validation [^1146EHFC]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for schizophrenia, particularly in managing drug side effects, the AIWG-ICG 2024 guidelines recommend co-prescribing metformin with medium-risk antipsychotics — such as quetiapine, paliperidone, or risperidone — to prevent antipsychotic-induced weight gain. This recommendation applies to patients with cardiometabolic risk factors or those aged 10–25 years.

### Evidence-based guidelines for the pharmacological treatment of schizophrenia: Updated recommendations from the British Association for Psychopharmacology [^114VWDKt]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2020). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for schizophrenia, specifically in relation to the initial assessment, the BAP 2020 guidelines recommend allowing approximately two weeks without antipsychotic treatment to clinically appraise the initial course of psychosis. This approach is suggested to exclude acute or transient psychotic disorders and substance-induced psychotic disorders, provided that risks such as aggression, self-harm, self-neglect, vulnerability, or deterioration can be appropriately monitored and mitigated.

Additionally, it is advised to consider prescribing GABA-modulating agents, such as benzodiazepines, for anxiety or insomnia for up to two weeks before tapering off.

### Comparative effectiveness of antipsychotic treatment strategies for relapse prevention in first-episode schizophrenia in Finland: a population-based cohort study [^113WtQzz]. The Lancet Psychiatry (2025). High credibility.

The best pharmacological treatment practices for relapse prevention in patients with first-episode schizophrenia are unclear. We aimed to assess different treatment strategies used before and after the first relapse and their associations with subsequent relapse risk.

In this population-based cohort study, we enrolled individuals (aged ≤ 45 years) with first-episode schizophrenia who were hospitalized and subsequently relapsed between 1996 and 2014 from the nationwide Finnish Hospital Discharge Register. Individuals who had not been taking antipsychotics within the year preceding initial hospitalization and who had a relapse within 5 years of discharge were included in the analyses. Treatment strategies were assessed during the 30 days before hospitalization for the first relapse and 30 days after discharge. These strategies were categorized as either long-acting injectable, clozapine, non-clozapine oral antipsychotic monotherapy, non-clozapine oral antipsychotic polypharmacy, or antipsychotic non-use. Adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) of the risk of second relapse based on treatment type were analyzed with Cox regression models for 2 years after the first relapse or until death or the end of data linkage (Dec 31, 2017). People with lived experience of schizophrenia were not involved in the research and writing process.

Between Jan 31, 1996, and Dec 31, 2017, 3000 individuals had their first psychosis relapse and were eligible for analysis. The mean age was 30.0 years (SD 7.6); 1069 (35.6%) of the patients were women, and 1931 (64.4%) were men. No ethnicity data were reported.

### Long-term remission with cariprazine treatment in patients with schizophrenia: A post hoc analysis of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, relapse prevention trial [^114KCpz7]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2019). High credibility.

Long-term remission is an important treatment goal in schizophrenia. Cariprazine, a dopamine D₃/D₂ receptor and serotonin 5-HT1A receptor partial agonist, is approved in the United States and Europe to treat adults with schizophrenia. Post hoc analyses of data from a long-term cariprazine relapse prevention study (NCT01412060; September 27, 2011-September 3, 2014) investigated the efficacy of cariprazine for maintaining remission in clinically stable patients with DSM-IV-TR-defined schizophrenia. Patients were stabilized with open-label cariprazine for 20 weeks, then randomized 1:1 to cariprazine (3, 6, or 9 mg/d) or placebo for double-blind treatment up to 72 weeks. Symptomatic remission was defined as scores ≤ 3 on 8 items from the General, Positive, and Negative Symptoms subscales of the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). Sustained remission included meeting remission criteria at all prior double-blind visits or for ≥ 6 consecutive months.

- **Results**: At randomization, 169 out of 200 patients (84.5%) met symptomatic remission criteria. During double-blind treatment, the time to loss of sustained remission was significantly longer (P = 0.0020) for cariprazine versus placebo (hazard ratio = 0.51); 60.5% of cariprazine-treated and 34.9% of placebo-treated patients sustained remission through the final visit (odds ratio [OR] = 2.85; p = 0.0012; number needed to treat [NNT] = 4). Almost twice as many cariprazine-treated (39.6%) as placebo-treated (21.2%) patients met symptomatic remission criteria at all visits for ≥ 6 consecutive months.

### Comparative effectiveness of antipsychotic treatment strategies for relapse prevention in first-episode schizophrenia in Finland: a population-based cohort study [^115JFkM4]. The Lancet Psychiatry (2025). High credibility.

Antipsychotic treatment is a key component in the management of schizophrenia, and a large proportion of patients have a good response to medication following their first episode. 81% of treated patients with first-episode schizophrenia have a 20% or greater reduction in total psychopathology, and 52% have a 50% or greater reduction in total psychopathology. Although most people achieve remission after their first psychotic episode, the major problem is related to subsequent relapses and treatment response, which could decrease over the course of illness or as a consequence of subsequent relapses. Despite reduced antipsychotic efficacy in patients with multi-episode versus first-episode schizophrenia, the relative ranking of efficacy appears to be roughly similar across patients with first-episode schizophrenia and other schizophrenia subgroups. Results from our previous nationwide cohort study indicated that the effectiveness of antipsychotics for relapse prevention decreases after the second relapse. This decrease in effectiveness occurred despite antipsychotic doses being increased after each consequent relapse. These results underline that prevention of second relapse is essential.

- **Research in context**: Relapse prevention is a key challenge in the treatment of people with schizophrenia. We searched PubMed from database inception until Aug 15, 2024, for relevant randomized controlled trials using the keywords "schizophrenia", "first-episode", "relapse", "antipsychotic", and "switch". Only papers published in English were included.

### Chronic treatment with aripiprazole prevents development of dopamine supersensitivity and potentially supersensitivity psychosis [^116rwLVJ]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2012). Low credibility.

For decades, the standard schizophrenia treatment protocol has included the administration of D₂ dopamine receptor blockers as effective antipsychotics, especially for the amelioration of psychotic symptoms. Long-term, continuous treatment with antipsychotic agents is emphasized as a treatment strategy to encourage remission in people with schizophrenia because the chance of relapse decreases if pharmacotherapy continues uninterrupted. However, even among stabilized patients maintained on optimal doses of antipsychotic depot therapy, significant rates of relapse have been reported.

It is widely recognized that a small reduction in antipsychotic dosage or a short-term interruption in antipsychotic drug therapy can induce an acute exacerbation of psychotic symptoms, and that the dose of antipsychotics needed to reduce such symptoms tends to increase with each relapse. There may be multiple causes for this phenomenon, including the development of the disease itself. One possible explanation, however, may be the development of supersensitivity psychosis associated with long-term treatment with D₂ receptor blockers.

Aripiprazole (ARI), an atypical antipsychotic that is commercially known as a dopamine partial agonist, is clinically used to treat schizophrenia. Treatment with ARI has been associated with the lowest rate of rehospitalization (71% risk reduction) among antipsychotics in clinical use, including both first- and second-generation antipsychotics. This suggests that, compared with other antipsychotics, ARI may more efficiently lower the risk of relapse.

### A double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized withdrawal study of lurasidone for the maintenance of efficacy in patients with schizophrenia [^111K3PGm]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2016). Low credibility.

The efficacy of lurasidone for the maintenance treatment of patients with schizophrenia was demonstrated in this multicenter, placebo-controlled, randomized withdrawal study. Forty-two percent of patients who entered the study completed the open-label stabilization phase, demonstrating that maintenance of stability with lurasidone was feasible over a three-month period. In the double-blind phase, treatment with lurasidone (40–80 mg/d) significantly delayed time to relapse and reduced the risk of relapse by 33.7% compared with placebo. The results of this study are consistent with findings of a previous 12-month, double-blind study, which showed that long-term treatment with lurasidone (40–160 mg/d) was associated with a relatively low probability of relapse, and demonstrated the non-inferiority of lurasidone relative to quetiapine XR (200–800 mg/d) for relapse prevention in patients with schizophrenia. The results of the study, taken together with the findings of the above-noted study, support the use of lurasidone as maintenance treatment for patients with schizophrenia across the dose range of 40–160 mg/d.

A key strength of the study is that clinical stability, defined using rigorous criteria, was demonstrated for at least 12 weeks during the open-label stabilization phase. This extended stabilization period increased the likelihood that subsequent emergence of symptoms represented recurrence of illness and not merely symptom fluctuation in patients who were not clinically stabilized.

### Impact of relapse in BDNF receptors expression in patients with a first episode of schizophrenia [^114f9Wk3]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2025). Low credibility.

Relapsing following a first episode of schizophrenia (FES) is a main predictor of clinical and functional prognosis. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) plays a critical role in neuronal development and plasticity, and its signaling may be altered by successive relapses.

- **Design**: We assessed the impact of first relapse in the expression of the two isoforms of the BDNF tropomyosin-related kinase B (TrkB) receptor (active full-length TrkB-F and inactive truncated TrkB-T) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 53 FES patients in clinical remission followed up for three years.

- **Results**: The group of participants that relapsed (n = 24) during the follow-up presented a significant decrease in the expression of the active TrkB-F receptor compared to baseline (M = 100 ± 28.13 vs. M = 83.42 ± 33.84, t = 2.5, P = 0.02), with no changes in the inactive TrkB-T receptor expression nor in BDNF plasma levels. This decrease also led to a significant decline in the F/T ratio (M = 1.13 ± 0.38 vs. 0.94 ± 0.36, t = 2.17, P = 0.041). No significant differences were found in the receptors' expression nor in plasma levels in the group of cases that remained in remission (n = 29). These results were not associated with baseline differences between the groups in terms of the BDNF signaling pathway biomarkers, clinical or treatment variables.

- **Conclusions**: These findings highlight the biological impact that a relapse produces over the systemic BDNF-TrkB signaling pathway, potentially undermining crucial neuronal functions. Identifying the actors involved can help design specific interventions to address these changes.

### Geodon [^1136LZaU]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2010). Low credibility.

The results of the oral ziprasidone trials in schizophrenia are detailed as follows:

- **4-week, placebo-controlled trial**: In a study with 139 participants comparing two fixed doses of ziprasidone (20 mg and 60 mg twice daily) with placebo, only the 60 mg dose was superior to placebo on the BPRS total score and the CGI severity score. This higher dose group did not show superiority over placebo on the BPRS psychosis cluster or on the SANS.

- **6-week, placebo-controlled trial**: A trial with 302 participants compared two fixed doses of ziprasidone (40 mg and 80 mg twice daily) with placebo. Both dose groups were superior to placebo on the BPRS total score, the BPRS psychosis cluster, the CGI severity score, and the PANSS total and negative subscale scores. The 80 mg twice daily dose had a numerically greater effect than the 40 mg twice daily dose, but the difference was not statistically significant.

- **6-week, placebo-controlled trial**: Involving 419 participants, this trial compared three fixed doses of ziprasidone (20 mg, 60 mg, and 100 mg twice daily) with placebo. All three dose groups were superior to placebo on the PANSS total score, the BPRS total score, the BPRS psychosis cluster, and the CGI severity score. Only the 100 mg twice daily dose group was superior to placebo on the PANSS negative subscale score. There was no clear evidence of a dose-response relationship within the 20 mg twice daily to 100 mg twice daily range.

- **4-week, placebo-controlled trial**: Conducted with 200 participants comparing three fixed doses of ziprasidone (5 mg, 20 mg, and 40 mg twice daily), none of the dose groups was statistically superior to placebo on any outcome of interest.

Additionally, a study was conducted in stable chronic or subchronic patients (CGI-S ≤ 5 at baseline).

### Relapse prevention in first-episode schizophrenia — maintenance vs intermittent drug treatment with prodrome-based early intervention: results of a randomized controlled trial within the German Research Network on Schizophrenia [^117Y4ZxE]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2011). High credibility.

After acute treatment of the first illness episode in schizophrenia, antipsychotic maintenance treatment is recommended for at least one year. Evidence for the optimal subsequent treatment remains limited. Targeted intermittent treatment was found to be less effective than continuous treatment in preventing relapse among multiple episode patients; however, a post hoc analysis of previous study data suggested comparable efficacy of these two treatment approaches in first-episode patients. This study was designed to prospectively compare the relapse preventive efficacy of further maintenance treatment and targeted intermittent treatment in patients with ICD-10-diagnosed first-episode schizophrenia.

A randomized controlled trial was conducted within the German Research Network on Schizophrenia. Entry screening took place between November 2000 and May 2004. After one year of antipsychotic maintenance treatment, stable first-episode patients were randomly assigned to 12 months of further maintenance treatment or stepwise drug discontinuation and targeted intermittent treatment. In case of prodromal symptoms of an impending relapse, patients in both groups received early drug intervention, guided by a decision algorithm. The primary outcome measure was relapse, defined as an increase in the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale positive score greater than 10, Clinical Global Impressions-Change score of 6 or more, and a decrease in the Global Assessment of Functioning score greater than 20 between two visits.

Of 96 first-episode patients, only 44 were eligible for the assigned treatment, highlighting challenges in patient selection and adherence to protocol.

### Has research informed us on the practical drug treatment of schizophrenia [^114y3dhP]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2008). Low credibility.

There is evidence to suggest that schizophrenia progresses after the first episode and worsens over several years. Can all drugs reduce progression? Are some better than others at this? There is insufficient evidence from RCTs to determine whether progression can be prevented and, if so, which is the best choice of drug.
