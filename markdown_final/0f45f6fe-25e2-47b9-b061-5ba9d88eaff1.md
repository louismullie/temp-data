## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which type of rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (RPGN) is characteristically associated with anti-glomerular basement membrane antibodies. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the classification of crescentic glomerulonephritis and where anti-GBM disease fits. Then, I should verify the immunofluorescence pattern that defines anti-GBM disease. Next, I will review the target antigen and pathophysiology to ensure mechanistic alignment. After that, I should check the clinical phenotype and how it differs from Type II and Type III RPGN. Finally, I will confirm the answer and briefly note diagnostic implications and exceptions like seronegative cases, just to be thorough.

> Let me first confirm the RPGN classification, because I need to ensure I'm mapping the antibody to the correct type. RPGN is classically divided into three categories: Type 1 anti-GBM disease with linear IgG deposition, Type 2 immune complex–mediated disease with granular deposits, and Type 3 pauci-immune disease associated with ANCA; anti-GBM antibodies are the defining feature of Type 1, not Type 2 or Type 3, so the correct choice should be Type I RPGN.

> Wait, let me verify the immunofluorescence signature, since that is the histologic hallmark I'm relying on. In anti-GBM disease, direct immunofluorescence shows a smooth, linear pattern of IgG along the glomerular basement membrane, which is pathognomonic for Type I RPGN and contrasts with the granular "lumpy-bumpy" pattern of immune complex disease and the pauci-immune pattern of ANCA-associated vasculitis, reinforcing that anti-GBM antibodies belong to Type I [^1125aTGx].

> I need to check the antigenic target to ensure the mechanistic story holds. Anti-GBM antibodies are directed against the noncollagenous domain 1 of the α3 chain of type IV collagen in specialized basement membranes of glomeruli and alveoli. This specificity underpins the renal-limited and pulmonary-renal phenotypes and is a core reason the disease is categorized as Type I RPGN rather than immune complex or pauci-immune processes.

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about clinical features without confirming the typical presentation. Anti-GBM disease typically presents with rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis and, in many patients, diffuse alveolar hemorrhage. This pulmonary-renal syndrome aligns with Type I RPGN and is mechanistically consistent with linear IgG deposition and complement activation along basement membranes, which is not the pattern seen in Type II or Type III RPGN.

> But wait, what if the question is trying to trick me with overlap syndromes or atypical serologies? I should double-check that the best answer remains Type I despite known associations with ANCA ("double-positive" disease) and rare seronegative cases with linear IgG on biopsy. Guidelines and reviews still classify anti-GBM disease as Type I RPGN, even when ANCA coexist or when circulating antibodies are not detected, so the correct choice is still Type I [^114XKb9f] [^116tgyMc] [^115wgssR].

> Final answer: Antiglomerular basement membrane antibodies are characteristically seen in Type I RPGN, which corresponds to option a [^113m1NsT] [^1125aTGx].

The correct answer is **a) Type I RPGN**. Anti-GBM antibodies are the hallmark of Type I rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (RPGN), causing linear IgG deposition along the glomerular basement membrane and crescentic necrotizing glomerulonephritis [^1125aTGx]. Type II RPGN is immune complex–mediated (granular deposits), and Type III RPGN is pauci-immune (ANCA-associated) [^1125aTGx]. IgA nephropathy is defined by mesangial IgA deposits, and post-streptococcal GN shows granular immune complex deposition — neither shows linear IgG staining.

---

## Classification of RPGN

RPGN is classified into three categories based on immunofluorescence findings:

| **Type** | **Pathogenesis** | **Immunofluorescence pattern** | **Examples** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Type I | Anti-GBM antibody-mediated | Linear IgG deposition along GBM | Anti-GBM disease (Goodpasture syndrome) |
| Type II | Immune complex-mediated | Granular immune complex deposition | - Systemic lupus erythematosus <br/> - Post-infectious GN <br/> - IgA nephropathy |
| Type III | Pauci-immune | Minimal or no immune deposition | ANCA-associated vasculitis |

---

Anti-GBM antibodies are **specific to Type I RPGN**, which is defined by linear IgG deposition along the GBM [^116LKEjD].

---

## Pathogenesis of anti-GBM disease

Anti-GBM disease is an autoimmune disorder characterized by **autoantibodies targeting the non-collagenous domain (NC1) of the α3 chain of type IV collagen** in the GBM and alveolar basement membrane [^115LS55h]. These antibodies initiate inflammation, leading to crescentic necrotizing glomerulonephritis and, frequently, pulmonary hemorrhage (Goodpasture syndrome) [^112nQaeD].

---

## Clinical features of anti-GBM disease

Typical clinical features include:

- **Rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis**: Acute renal failure with hematuria, proteinuria, and oliguria/anuria [^113YdcHC].
- **Pulmonary hemorrhage**: Hemoptysis, dyspnea, and respiratory failure [^113YdcHC].
- **Linear IgG deposition**: Characteristic finding on renal biopsy immunofluorescence [^111gu5QW].

---

## Laboratory diagnosis

Laboratory diagnosis relies on **detecting circulating anti-GBM antibodies** by ELISA or indirect immunofluorescence [^115i19Zd]. Renal biopsy with immunofluorescence showing linear IgG deposition along the GBM confirms the diagnosis [^111gu5QW].

---

## Differential diagnosis

The differential diagnosis includes other causes of RPGN:

- **Type II RPGN**: Immune complex-mediated diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus, post-infectious glomerulonephritis, and IgA nephropathy [^113m1NsT].
- **Type III RPGN**: Pauci-immune vasculitis associated with ANCA [^112MvxvR].
- **IgA nephropathy**: Characterized by mesangial IgA deposits, not linear IgG deposition [^115h6iDY].
- **Post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis**: Granular immune complex deposition, not linear IgG [^116h6atc].

---

## Conclusion

Anti-GBM antibodies are **characteristically seen in Type I RPGN**, which is defined by linear IgG deposition along the GBM and crescentic necrotizing glomerulonephritis [^1125aTGx] [^111FdCTM]. This distinguishes it from Type II (immune complex) and Type III (pauci-immune) RPGN, as well as from IgA nephropathy and post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis, which have different immunofluorescence patterns and pathogeneses [^1125aTGx] [^115h6iDY] [^116h6atc] [^112ie3aB].

### Long-term outcome of anti-glomerular basement membrane antibody disease treated with plasma exchange and immunosuppression [^117YFmFx]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Anti-glomerular basement membrane (GBM) antibody disease is an autoantibody-mediated disorder that usually presents as rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis, often with pulmonary hemorrhage (the Goodpasture syndrome). It is reported that patients with severe renal failure do not generally recover renal function.

Objective

To examine the long-term outcome of severe anti-GBM antibody disease.

Design

Retrospective review of patients treated for confirmed anti-GBM antibody disease over 25 years.

Setting

A tertiary referral center in the United Kingdom.

Patients

71 treated patients with anti-GBM antibody disease.

Intervention

All patients received plasma exchange, prednisolone, and cyclophosphamide.

Measurements

Patient and renal survival, renal histology, and antibody levels.

Results

Patients who presented with a creatinine concentration less than 500 micromol/L (5.7 mg/dL) (n = 19) had 100% patient survival and 95% renal survival at 1 year and 84% patient survival and 74% renal survival at last follow-up. In patients who presented with a creatinine concentration of 500 micromol/L or more (≥ 5.7 mg/dL) (n = 13) but did not require immediate dialysis, patient and renal survival were 83% and 82% at 1 year and 62% and 69% at last follow-up. In patients who presented with dialysis-dependent renal failure (n = 39), patient and renal survival were 65% and 8% at 1 year and 36% and 5% at last follow-up. All patients who required immediate dialysis and had 100% crescents on renal biopsy remained dialysis dependent.

Conclusions

Patients with the Goodpasture syndrome and severe renal failure should be considered for urgent immunosuppression therapy, including plasma exchange, to maximize the chance of renal recovery. Patients needing immediate dialysis are less likely to recover.

### Goodpasture's syndrome: a clinical update [^1155pMUN]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Goodpasture's syndrome (GS) is a rare and organ-specific autoimmune disease that is mediated by anti-glomerular basement membrane (anti-GBM) antibodies and has pathology characterized by crescentic glomerulonephritis with linear immunofluorescent staining for IgG on the GBM. It typically presents as acute renal failure caused by a rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis, accompanied by pulmonary hemorrhage that may be life-threatening. It was first described as a distinctive syndrome by Pasture in 1919. Autoimmune Inner Ear Disease (AIED) may be associated. The etiology of GS is unknown. Researchers hypothesized a genetic predisposition HLA-associated. Complex immunological mechanisms are in the pathogenesis. The disease is caused by autoantibodies against the NC1 domain of the alpha 3 chain of type IV collagen. The limited presence of this molecule in the body explains the interest confined to specific target organs, such as the lung and kidney. It occurs when the immune system attacks the walls of the lungs and the tiny filtering units in the kidneys. Without prompt diagnosis and treatment, the disease can lead to bleeding in the lungs, kidney failure, and even death.

### Immunology of anti-glomerular basement membrane disease [^116L6aTe]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2002). Low credibility.

Anti-glomerular basement membrane disease is a form of autoimmune glomerulonephritis often accompanied by lung haemorrhage. It is characterized by circulating and deposited antibodies that bind basement membrane components in the glomerulus and lung alveolus. Since early descriptions of the deposition of immunoglobulin on the glomerular basement membrane, work has focused on the binding properties of the autoantibodies, and this has led to the identification of the autoantigen as the non-collagenous region of the alpha 3 chain of type IV collagen. Despite being thought of as a prototypic antibody mediated autoimmune disease, it is becoming apparent that both humoral and cellular immune mechanisms act in concert to initiate and perpetuate disease. Recent data have shed light on the molecular pathogenesis of anti-glomerular basement membrane disease and provided a more complete framework on which to build our understanding of autoimmune renal disease. This should lead to novel approaches to immunotherapy for patients with glomerulonephritis.

### Atypical anti-glomerular basement membrane disease with Anti-GBM antibody negativity and ANCA positivity: a case report [^116w7TS7]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, cases of anti-GBM disease in patients whose serum is negative for anti-GBM antibodies and positive for ANCAs are clinically sporadic. The use of ELISA to detect anti-GBM antibodies can yield false-negative results. Thus, negative serum anti-GBM antibody test results are not sufficient to rule out anti-GBM disease. Kidney or lung biopsy is needed to confirm or exclude anti-GBM disease in patients with a high degree of clinical suspicion whose serum is negative for anti-GBM antibodies. Insights from this unusual case might help physicians diagnose a rare form of glomerulonephritis and treat affected patients in a timely manner.

### Rapidly progressive crescentic glomerulonephritis: early treatment is a must [^1125aTGx]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

The term crescentic glomerulonephritis (GN) refers to a pathologic condition characterized by extracapillary proliferation in > 50% of glomeruli. Clinically crescentic GN is characterized by a nephritic syndrome rapidly progressing to end stage renal disease (ESRD). Three types of crescentic GN have been identified. Type 1 includes cases of Goodpasture syndrome characterized by linear deposits of antibodies along the glomerular basement membrane (GBM) at immunofluorescence. Type 2 is a heterogeneous group of primary or secondary glomerular diseases complicated by crescentic GN. In this category there are granular deposits of immunoglobulins and complement fractions on the glomerular tuft. Type 3 includes cases of ANCA-associated small-vessel vasculitis. Immunofluorescence is negative or may show only faint deposits of immunoglobulins. The etiology and the initial pathogenetic factors are different in the three types, but the final mechanisms leading to crescent formation and the renal symptoms and signs are similar. The prognosis depends on the timeline of diagnosis and treatment. Although some patients requiring dialysis may recover a good renal function, usually the higher the serum creatinine at presentation the worse the outcome. When treatment is initiated early, most patients obtain a complete or partial remission. High-dose corticosteroids and cyclophosphamide represent the standard therapy for crescentic GN. The addition of plasma exchange may also be helpful, particularly in patients with massive alveolar hemorrhage. Anti-B monoclonal antibodies have also been used in some patients with crescentic GN, but their role in this particular area is still poorly established.

### Anti-glomerular basement membrane disease: an update on subgroups, pathogenesis and therapies [^11514AcG]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2019). Medium credibility.

Most patients with anti-glomerular basement membrane (anti-GBM) disease present with rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis with or without pulmonary haemorrhage; however, there are several variants and vigilance is necessary to make a correct diagnosis. Such variants include overlap with anti-neutrophil cytoplasm antibodies-associated vasculitis and membranous nephropathy as well as anti-GBM occurring de novo after renal transplantation. Moreover, patients can present with isolated pulmonary haemorrhage as well as with negative tests for circulating anti-GBM. Virtually all patients with anti-GBM disease have autoantibodies that react with two discrete epitopes on the α3 chain of type IV collagen. Recent evidence suggests that healthy persons have low-affinity natural antibodies reacting with the same epitopes, but most people are protected from developing disease-causing high-affinity autoantibodies by human leukocyte antigen-dependent regulatory T-cells (Tregs). The α3 chain-derived peptides presented by the HLA-DR15 antigen lack the ability to promote the development of such Tregs. The detection of anti-GBM in circulation using the rapid assay test has led to early diagnosis and improved prognosis. However, our present tools to curb the inflammation and to eliminate the assaulting antibodies are insufficient. Only about one-third of all patients survive with functioning native kidneys. More effective therapies need to be developed; agents that inhibit neutrophil recruitment, deplete B cells and cleave immunoglobulin G (IgG) in vivo may become new weapons in the arsenal to combat anti-GBM disease.

### A case report of atypical anti-glomerular basement membrane disease [^115i19Zd]. BMC Nephrology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Anti-glomerular basement membrane (anti-GBM) disease presents with necrotizing and crescentic glomerulonephritis caused by autoantibodies against the GBM, which often leads to pulmonary hemorrhage. Anti-GBM glomerulonephritis is a rare disease caused by linear deposition of immunoglobulin G (IgG) autoantibodies against the GBM, most commonly the non-collagenous domain of the alpha-3 chain (α3NC1) of type IV collagen. Classic anti-GBM disease is clinically associated with rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis and pulmonary hemorrhage, a shortened life expectancy, and poor renal prognosis. However, some patients have better renal outcomes and milder symptoms than those with classic anti-GBM disease despite strong linear staining for IgG. Moreover, they lack circulating antibodies against α3NC1, which are detected using a commercially available enzyme immunoassay (EIA). The EIA method includes enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA), chemiluminescence enzyme immunoassays (CLEIA), and fluorescence enzyme immunoassays (FEIA). This clinical presentation is termed atypical anti-GBM disease. Atypical anti-GBM disease is presumably caused by circulating pathogenic immunoglobulin that recognizes different GBM epitopes than those in classic anti-GBM disease.

Classic anti-GBM disease often worsens more rapidly than other types of glomerulonephritis because several glomeruli are damaged simultaneously through the direct mechanism caused by anti-GBM antibodies. Therefore, early diagnosis and aggressive treatment initiation are important. Patients with classic anti-GBM nephritis are usually treated with high-dose steroids, cyclophosphamide, and plasma apheresis. The treatment of atypical anti-GBM is controversial, and it is unclear whether the benefits of aggressive treatment outweigh the risks.

Here, we report the case of a patient with acute kidney injury, proteinuria, and hematuria whose renal biopsy showed crescentic glomerulonephritis without circulating α3NC1 antibodies. We diagnosed anti-GBM disease using an indirect immunofluorescence antibody method (IIF). The patient's proteinuria and hematuria resolved, and her renal function improved with aggressive treatment, including high-dose steroids and plasma exchange.

### Diagnostic and management challenges in goodpasture's (anti-glomerular basement membrane) disease [^114U95Yh]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2018). Low credibility.

Goodpasture's or anti-glomerular basement membrane (GBM) disease is classically characterized by the presence of circulating autoantibodies directed against the non-collagenous domain of the α3 chain of type IV collagen, targeting glomerular and alveolar basement membranes, and associated with rapidly progressive crescentic glomerulonephritis, with alveolar haemorrhage in over half the patients. However, there are increasing examples of variants or atypical presentations of this disease, and novel therapeutic options have been proposed, which nephrologists should be aware of. The pathophysiology of this condition has been understood through molecular analysis of the antibody-antigen interactions and the use of human leucocyte antigen-transgenic animals, while the association of anti-GBM antibodies with anti-neutrophil cytoplasm antibodies and their combined impact on disease phenotype is increasingly recognized, providing some insights into the basis of glomerular damage and autoimmunity.

Anti-glomerular basement membrane (anti-GBM) disease — initial therapy should follow Practice Point 11.2.1 that "Treatment for anti-GBM disease should start without delay if this diagnosis is suspected, even before the diagnosis is confirmed", with Commentary noting "empirical solumedrol and plasma exchange should begin immediately when anti-GBM disease is suspected". Practice Point 11.2.2 states "Plasma exchange should be performed until anti-GBM titers are no longer detectable", and the Commentary adds "Most cases (97%) have undetectable anti-GBM antibodies within 8 weeks of immunosuppression and plasma exchange initiation" and that "extended plasma exchange should be continued until the anti-GBM antibody levels are negative on 2 consecutive tests". Replacement fluid guidance in the Commentary notes "Plasma exchange with albumin replacement is sufficient, but if there is alveolar hemorrhage or a recent kidney biopsy, replacement with fresh frozen plasma is preferred".

### Pulmonary renal syndrome in a child with coexistence of anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies and anti-glomerular basement membrane disease: case report and literature review [^114F3KQH]. BMC Nephrology (2013). Low credibility.

Conclusion

The pulmonary renal syndrome is very rare in children but represents a serious medical emergency with significant morbidity and mortality. An early diagnosis is crucial and laboratory investigation should be directed toward testing for presence of different antibodies. The coexistence of anti-GBM antibodies and ANCAs is exceptionally rare in children. Rapid institution of plasmapheresis and aggressive immunosuppressive therapy can induce remission and preserve renal function in dual positive patients with PRS. Prolonged therapy, long-term follow-up and close monitoring are necessary as relapses may occur. Renal prognosis depends on the extent of kidney injury at diagnosis and appropriate treatment.

### Development of anti-glomerular basement membrane glomerulonephritis during the course of IgA nephropathy: a case report [^115UikcH]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion and conclusions

IgA nephropathy is an immune complex-mediated glomerulonephritis defined immunohistologically by the presence of glomerular mesangial IgA deposits accompanied by a variety of histopathologic lesions, including mesangial proliferation. Anti-GBM disease is caused by antibodies reactive to the glomerular and alveolar basement membrane.

The causal relationship of anti-GBM glomerulonephritis and IgA nephropathy is unclear. There was one hypothesis that the IgA-related immune complex might promote immunologic and inflammatory events, resulting in conformational changes and exposure of the GBM antigens leading to development of anti-GBM antibody. However, it is difficult to prove whether anti-GBM disease in this patient developed as an incidental complication or was secondary to IgA nephropathy because there is still no established marker to distinguish primary from secondary anti-GBM disease. In this regard, we performed immunofluorescence staining for IgG subclasses on the second renal biopsy, and found that IgG4 was the main subclass of IgG bound to GBM in this patient (Fig. 6). The main subclass of pathogenic IgG in anti-GBM disease was reported to be usually IgG1. Whether predominance of IgG4 relates with anti-GBM disease developed secondary to IgA nephropathy deserves future study.

Fig. 6
Immunofluorescence staining for IgG subclasses on the second renal biopsy (Scale bars = 20.0 μm). The main subclass of IgG bound to GBM was IgG4

The pathophysiological condition of anti-GBM disease before clinical presentation is unknown. In this regard, Olson et al. conducted a case-control study involving 30 patients diagnosed with anti-GBM disease using serum samples from the Department of Defense Serum Repository. In the report, 13% (4 of 30) of study subjects had an elevated anti-GBM antibody level 2–10 months prior to diagnosis. In the present case, multiple immunofluorescence labelling on the first biopsy showed partial linear IgG deposition along the glomerular capillary walls (Fig. 7). Although it may be only speculation because serum anti-GBM antibody was not tested at the time of the first biopsy, the patient might have had complications from asymptomatic (subclinical) anti-GBM disease at that point.

Regarding medical management for anti-glomerular basement membrane disease, more specifically with respect to immunosuppressive therapy, KDIGO 2021 guidelines recommend to initiate immunosuppression with cyclophosphamide and corticosteroid plus plasmapheresis in all patients with anti-GBM glomerulonephritis, except patients receiving dialysis at presentation, having 100% crescents or > 50% global glomerulosclerosis in an adequate biopsy sample, and not having a pulmonary hemorrhage.

### Proliferative glomerulonephritis with linear immunoglobulin deposition: is this atypical antiglomerular basement membrane disease? [^111PaefD]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

The antiglomerular basement membrane (anti-GBM) antibody disease is marked by the presence of specific antibodies against the non-collagenous domain of the type IV collagen's α3 chain. We describe a case of a 24-year-old Caucasian man, who may have had an atypical presentation of anti-GBM (slow progressive renal insufficiency, massive proteinuria and no detectable circulating anti-GBM antibody). The patient was treated with steroids and cyclophosphamide. This approach failed to attenuate the disease, and so rituximab was initiated with subsequent clinical improvement, normalisation of urinary sediment and marked regression of proteinuria; renal function remained stable. The renal biopsy immunofluorescence was crucial for the diagnosis.

### Association of epitope spreading of antiglomerular basement membrane antibodies and kidney injury [^111AS3he]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2013). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Antiglomerular basement membrane autoantibodies are pathogenic in antiglomerular basement membrane disease with two major epitopes, E(A) and E(B), on α3 chain of type IV collagen. This study investigated the epitope spectrum of antiglomerular basement membrane autoantibodies, aiming to identify the association between epitope specificity and kidney injury.

Design, Setting, Participants, & Measurements

All 108 patients with antiglomerular basement membrane disease and complete clinical data were divided into three groups according to renal dysfunction: mild group (n = 20) with serum creatitine ≤ 1.5 mg/dl; moderate group (n = 22) with serum creatinine = 1.5–6.8 mg/dl; severe group (n = 66) with serum creatitine ≥ 6.8 mg/dl. Epitope spectrums of antibodies were determined by ELISA, and their associations with kidney damage were analyzed. Sequential serum samples in 40 patients were examined during disease courses.

Results

E(A) and E(B) were recognized in 79.6% and 72.2% of patients, respectively. E(A) and E(B) reactions were the lowest in the mild group and higher in the moderate group (E(A): 35.0% versus 81.8%, P = 0.002; E(B): 15.0% versus 68.2%, P = 0.001). They were the highest in the severe group (E(A): 92.4%, P = 0.31; E(B): 90.9%, P = 0.02). Close association was observed between renal injury and E(A) and E(B) reactions. Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that E(B) reaction was an independent risk factor for renal failure (hazard ratio = 6.91, P = 0.02). The recognition for non-E(AB) remained low among groups. No augmentation of epitope spectrum was shown in serial serum samples.

Conclusions

Intramolecular epitope spreading might occur before the onset of human antiglomerular basement membrane disease. The autoimmunity to E(A) and E(B), especially E(B), was crucial for kidney dysfunction.

Table 2

+: positive; -: negative. FPE: podocyte foot process effacement. NA: not available

In summary, although atypical anti-GBM disease shares similarities with typical anti-GBM disease in terms of immunofluorescence, where immunoglobulin is deposited linearly along the GBM, its clinicopathologic manifestations, response to treatment, and prognosis differ from those of typical anti-GBM disease. This suggests that it has a pathogenesis distinct from that of typical anti-GBM disease. Therefore, it is recommended to evaluate active and chronic lesions through pathology before deciding whether to pursue treatment involving massive corticosteroid therapy and cyclophosphamide.

### Atypical anti-glomerular basement membrane disease with membranous hyperplasia: diagnostic challenges and treatment variability [^116qzPVp]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

In the management of anti-GBM disease, timely and effective treatment is crucial for improving outcomes. The standard therapeutic strategy includes a combination of immunosuppression (usually with corticosteroids and cyclophosphamide) and plasmapheresis. The goal of immunosuppression is to dampen the immune response and reduce antibody production, while plasmapheresis aims to remove circulating anti-GBM antibodies from the plasma, thereby reducing their pathogenic impact on the kidneys and lungs. For patients with atypical anti-GBM disease, as in our case, treatment decisions can be challenging due to the absence of circulating antibodies detectable by standard assays. However, the presence of organ involvement necessitates a similar approach to that of the typical form. Clinical symptoms and pathology of atypical anti-GBM disease differ from those of typical anti-GBM nephropathy with specificity. An accurate diagnosis based on pathology is essential for the appropriate management of acute and chronic lesions, guiding treatment decisions that may involve massive corticosteroid therapy and cyclophosphamide. Here, we reviewed a total of 20 case reports of pathology of atypical anti-GBM disease. Atypical anti-GBM disease shares similarities with typical anti-GBM disease in linear deposition of IgG. As shown in Table 2, a defining characteristic of atypical anti-GBM disease is negative serum anti-GBM antibodies. Cellular glomerular crescent, a histomorphological indicator of a rupture of glomerular capillaries, is the common pathological finding in both atypical anti-GBM disease and anti-GBM disease. As shows in Tables 2 and 75% (15/20) of atypical anti-GBM disease cases exhibit glomerular crescents. This phenomenon is usually a consequence of an intense immune attack involving cytotoxic elements, such as the complement membrane attack complex and extracellular histones, known as necroinflammation. Mesangial hyperplasia is more common in diabetic nephropathy, and it can be observed in 40% (8/20) of cases with atypical anti-GBM disease. If the blood glucose levels and screening of microalbuminuria are normal, it's not considered diabetic nephropathy. Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN) is identified by specific patterns of glomerular injury seen on a kidney biopsy. These patterns are characterized by distinct light microscopic changes, which include hypercellularity and thickening of the glomerular basement membrane (GBM). In this case, we observed the thickening of the glomerular basement membrane. However, since we didn't observe the dense deposits by electron microcopy, MPGN was not considered. Thickening of the glomerular basement membrane is not a common phenomenon in atypical anti-GBM disease, with only 15% (3/20) observed. This highlights the importance of a comprehensive diagnostic approach that considers multiple factors.

### Case report: anti-glomerular basement membrane antibody disease with normal renal function [^114r5Ykv]. BMC Nephrology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Anti-glomerular basement membrane (GBM) disease is included among immune complex small vessel vasculitides. This disease is a vasculitis that affects the glomerular capillaries, pulmonary capillaries, or both, with GBM deposition of anti-GBM autoantibodies. Lung involvement causes pulmonary hemorrhage, and renal involvement causes glomerulonephritis with necrosis and crescents. It has a frequency of 0.5–1 case per million/year. All age groups can be affected, but the peak incidence occurs in the third decade in young men with a second peak in the sixth and seventh decades, which affects men and women equally. Although anti-GBM disease in childhood is quite uncommon, we observed anti-GBM disease in an 8-year-old girl with normal renal function who had participated in a school urine screening program.

### Atypical anti-glomerular basement membrane disease with membranous hyperplasia: diagnostic challenges and treatment variability [^1152eDbo]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

This case report presents a detailed analysis of a 31-year-old male patient who presented with a complex array of clinical symptoms, including proteinuria, hematuria, edema, and kidney insufficiency. Despite undergoing multiple tests, the results for anti-glomerular basement membrane antibodies yielded negative findings. Subsequently, kidney biopsy pathology revealed a distinct diagnosis of atypical anti-glomerular basement membrane (anti-GBM) disease with membrane hyperplasia. Treatment was initiated with a comprehensive approach involving high doses of corticosteroids therapy and cyclophosphamide (CTX). However, contrary to expectations, the patient's kidney function exhibited rapid deterioration following this therapeutic regimen. The culmination of these complications necessitated a pivotal transition to maintenance hemodialysis. This case underscores the intricate challenges associated with diagnosing and managing rare and atypical presentations of kidney disorders. The negative anti-GBM antibody results and subsequent identification of atypical anti-GBM nephropathy highlight the need for tailored diagnostic strategies to discern subtle nuances within complex clinical scenarios. Additionally, the unexpected response to the treatment regimen emphasizes the potential variability in individual patient responses, underlining the necessity for vigilant monitoring and adaptable treatment strategies. This case report contributes to the evolving understanding of atypical kidney pathologies and the complexities involved in their management.

### Atypical anti-glomerular basement membrane nephritis: a case series from the French nephropathology group [^1138WWmD]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Rationale & Objective

Atypical anti-glomerular basement membrane (GBM) nephritis is characterized by a bright linear immunoglobulin staining along the GBM by immunofluorescence without a diffuse crescentic glomerulonephritis nor serum anti-GBM antibodies by conventional enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). We characterized a series of patients with atypical anti-GBM disease.

Study Design

Case series.

Setting & Participants

Patients identified by the French Nephropathology Group as having atypical anti-GBM nephritis between 2003 and 2022.

Findings

Among 38 potential cases, 25 were included, of whom 14 (56%) were female and 23 (92%) had hematuria. The median serum creatinine at diagnosis was 150 (IQR, 102–203) μmol/L and median urine protein-creatinine ratio (UPCR) was 2.4 (IQR, 1.3–5.2) g/g. Nine patients (36%) had endocapillary proliferative glomerulonephritis (GN), 4 (16%) had mesangial proliferative GN, 4 (16%) had membranoproliferative GN, 2 (8%) had pure and focal crescentic GN, 1 (4%) had focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, and 5 had glomeruli that were unremarkable on histopathology. Nine patients (36%) had crescents, involving a median of 9% of glomeruli. Bright linear staining for IgG was seen in 22 cases (88%) and for IgA in 3 cases (12%). The 9 patients (38%) who had a monotypic staining pattern tended to be older with less proteinuria and rarely had crescents. Kidney survival rate at 1 year was 83% and did not appear to be associated with the light chain restriction.

Limitations

Retrospective case series with a limited number of biopsies including electron microscopy.

Conclusions

Compared with typical anti-GBM disease, atypical anti-GBM nephritis frequently presents with an endocapillary or mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis pattern and appears to have a slower disease progression. Further studies are needed to fully characterize its pathophysiology and associated clinical outcomes.

Plain-Language Summary

Atypical anti-glomerular basement membrane (GBM) nephritis is characterized histologically by bright linear immunoglobulin staining along the GBM without diffuse crescentic glomerulonephritis or circulating anti-GBM antibodies. We report a case series of 25 atypical cases of anti-GBM nephritis in collaboration with the French Nephropathology Group. Compared with typical anti-GBM disease, we observed a slower disease progression. Patients frequently presented with heavy proteinuria and commonly had evidence of endocapillary or mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis. About half of the patients displayed a monotypic immune staining pattern; they tended to be older, with less proteinuria, and commonly without glomerular crescents in biopsy specimens. No concomitant circulating monoclonal gammopathy was detected. Further studies are needed to fully characterize its pathophysiology and associated clinical outcomes.

### The spectrum of renal diseases associated with anti-basement membrane antibodies… [^116LKEjD]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

- Nephritis associated with anti-basement membrane antibodies includes a spectrum of glomerular and/or tubulointerstitial involvement. The glomerular disease may present as Goodpasture's syndrome, rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis, a mild focal, segmental, proliferative glomerulonephritis, or chronic glomerulonephritis. The tubulointerstitial nephritis is associated with antibodies directed against the basement membrane of the tubules and may occur as a result of drug hypersensitivity. Routine light microscopy or electron microscopy may not be diagnostic of these syndromes. Immunofluorescent examination of renal tissue demonstrates a smooth, linear pattern of immunoglobulin or complement deposition along the glomerular or tubular basement membrane. Anti-basement membrane antibodies may also be detected in the circulation.

Treatment of these syndromes is directed at eradication of the stimulus for antibody production, blockage of antibody production by immunosuppressive drugs, and removal of the existing antibody from the circulation by plasmapheresis or plasma exchange transfusion.

### Crescentic glomerulonephritis with Anti-GBM antibody but no glomerular deposition [^114zV3Mn]. BMC Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Anti-glomerular basement membrane (GBM) antibodies are highly specific for Goodpasture's or anti-GBM disease, in which they are generally directed against the non-collagenous (NC1) domain of the alpha 3 chain of type IV collagen(α3(IV)), and less commonly, toward the α 4(IV) or α 5(IV) chains, which form a triple helical structure in GBM and alveolar basement membrane (ABM). Alterations in the hexameric structure of the NC1 (α3 (IV)), allows novel epitopes to be exposed and an immune response to develop, with subsequent linear antibody deposition along the GBM, leading to a crescentic glomerulonephritis. Positive anti-GBM antibodies are assumed to be pathogenic and capable of binding GBM in vivo, especially in the context of rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis. We have investigated patients with circulating anti-GBM antibodies, reactive to α3 (IV) and human GBM by immunoassays and Western blotting respectively, with focal necrotising crescentic glomerulonephritis but no linear GBM antibody deposition on immunohistochemistry. Three out of four were also ANCA positive. Despite not binding native GBM, patients' sera showed linear binding to primate glomeruli by indirect immunofluorescence, in the 2 cases tested. Following treatment, significant improvements in kidney function were found in 3/4 patients.

Case Presentation

We present four patients with crescentic glomerulonephritis and circulating anti-GBM antibodies, but no glomerular binding.

Conclusions

These novel findings, demonstrate that in some patients anti-GBM antibodies may not bind their own GBM. This has important implications for clinical diagnosis, suggesting that histological confirmation of kidney injury by anti-GBM antibodies should be obtained, as non-binding GBM antibodies may be associated with significant renal recovery.

### Concurrent anti-glomerular basement membrane antibody disease and membranous nephropathy: a case series [^116rKKKE]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Rationale & Objective

Anti-glomerular basement membrane (GBM) disease is a rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis which, in some instances, occurs concurrently with other diseases such as antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis. Rarely, it also occurs with membranous nephropathy (MN). We report a series of such patients, characterizing their long-term follow up.

Study Design

Case series.

Setting & Participants

Twelve patients referred to 1 medical center between 2001 and 2019 with anti-GBM disease and MN whose clinical characteristics and course were described.

Results

Patients' ages ranged from 20 to 81 years old, and all presented with severe acute kidney injury requiring dialysis on presentation or shortly thereafter. Only 1 patient had pulmonary findings on presentation. The predominant pathology was crescentic and necrotizing glomerulonephritis with linear staining for immunoglobulin G along the GBM associated with epimembranous electron-dense immune-type deposits. All 11 patients who were tested had significant titers of anti-GBM antibodies, but only 1 of the 5 tested for phospholipase A 2 receptor (PLA 2 R) on biopsy was positive. Eight patients received therapy with cyclophosphamide, prednisone, and plasmapheresis; 2 patients with prednisone and plasmapheresis; and 2 with rituximab-based regimens. Progression to a requirement for kidney replacement therapy occurred in all 12 patients, but 2 patients later recovered kidney function. Recurrence of anti-GBM disease did not occur for any of the patients studied.

Limitations

Incomplete testing for PLA 2 R in biopsy and serum, limited sample size, and lack of uniform treatment regimen.

Conclusions

In this case series, the presentation of concurrent anti-GBM disease and MN was characterized by rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis and poor kidney outcomes. These findings suggest possible value from earlier diagnosis and the need for identification of more effective treatment regimens.

### The glomerular crescent: triggers, evolution, resolution, and implications for therapy [^112Yy3NK]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2020). Medium credibility.

Antiglomerular basement membrane disease

Anti-GBM disease and Goodpasture syndrome develop from an autoimmune response against antigens located in the NC1 domain of collagen type IV and the peroxidase peroxidasin. The disease is rare and the trigger unknown but its occurrence in small clusters of unrelated patients suggest yet undefined environmental factors. The circulating 'anti-GBM' antibodies are considered pathogenic as the appearance and disappearance of these antibodies coincides with CGN disease activity, although occasionally antibodies reacting in GBM bioassays may not bind to patient's GBM or not all linear IgG deposits in CGN may relate to 'GBM antibodies'. Nevertheless, these pathogenic autoantibodies are the central therapeutic target in anti-GBM disease and either depleting circulating IgG by plasma exchange or by a specific IgG-degrading enzyme improves disease activity. GBM antisera are frequently used to induce CGN in rodents to study more downstream mechanisms of antibody-mediated injury to the glomerular microvasculature using crescent formation as a readout parameter. For example, glomerular IgG deposits promote glomerular neutrophil recruitment via Fc gamma receptor IIA on neutrophils. In addition, the pro-inflammatory roles of murine double minute-2, NETs, and extracellular histones all contribute to anti-GBM IgG-induced CGN. In contrast, regulatory T cells only contribute to the afferent phase of lymphocyte priming but not to intrarenal inflammation.

C3 glomerulonephritis

C3 glomerulonephritis (C3GN) arises from abnormal regulation of the alternative complement pathway leading to electron dense deposits in the mesangium or along the glomerular filtration barrier that contain complement but no immunoglobulins. Although C3GN most frequently presents with membranoproliferative lesions, C3GN has been reported to present as severe necrotizing and crescentic glomerulonephritis in humans and mice. When acquired antibodies against factor H, B or other complement regulators are the cause of a C3GN, drugs that suppress the adaptive immune system such as steroids, mycophenolate mofetil or rituximab may be effective. In contrast, patients with genetic defects in complement regulators may (in the future) benefit from therapy with C3 convertase inhbitors or other downstream elements of the complement cascade.

### A case report of atypical anti-glomerular basement membrane disease [^113rQCQk]. BMC Nephrology (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion and conclusions

Our report describes the case of a patient with atypical anti-GBM disease with proteinuria, hematuria, and acute kidney injury. Pathologically, crescentic glomerulonephritis was detected in kidney tissues. Because anti-GBM antibodies binding to alpha3 (IV) NC1 were not detected by FEIA, IIF was used to identify anti-GBM antibodies. Finally, combination therapy with high-dose steroids and plasma exchange was effective for atypical anti-GBM disease with acute kidney injury, resulting in improvements in proteinuria, hematuria, and renal function.

Anti-GBM disease is a type of nephritis that histologically presents as crescentic necrotizing glomerulonephritis, with linear deposits of IgG against the GBM and serological positivity for anti-GBM antibodies. It was first reported by Lerner et al in 1967. Classic anti-GBM disease is associated with rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis and often pulmonary hemorrhage, shortened life expectancy, and poor renal prognosis. Atypical anti-GBM disease presents with better renal outcomes and milder symptoms compared with classic anti-GBM disease, and circulating antibodies to α3NC1 are not detected by EIA in atypical anti-GBM disease.

### Anti-glomerular basement membrane antibodies in the diagnosis of goodpasture syndrome: a comparison of different assays [^111tGbaC]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2006). Low credibility.

Background

The role of anti-glomerular basement membrane (GBM) antibodies in the pathogenesis of Goodpasture syndrome (GPS) is firmly established. Untreated, the disease may follow a fulminating course. Early identification of patients has important implications in terms of management and prognosis. Therefore, a diagnostic test for the determination of circulating anti-GBM antibodies, of very high sensitivity and specificity, is necessary. A number of assays, using different antigenic substrates, are available, but studies comparing the 'performances' of the different tests are scarce.

Methods

The aim of our work was to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of four immunoassay-based anti-GBM antibodies kits. Thirty-four serum samples from 19 GPS patients, 41 pathological and 28 normal controls were studied retrospectively (the follow-up samples were not included in the analysis of performance data). Cut-off limits were derived from receiver operating characteristics curve analysis.

Results

All the assays showed a comparable good sensitivity (between 94.7 and 100.0%), whereas specificity varied considerably (from 90.9 to 100.0%). The better performance in terms of sensitivity/specificity was achieved by a fluorescence immunoassay which utilizes a recombinant antigen.

Conclusion

All the assays have a good performance, with high sensitivity; however, the specificity may vary considerably.

### Antiglomerular basement membrane (anti-GBM) disease with clinical and histological features that bridge the typical to atypical spectrum [^115zv4BG]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

We describe antiglomerular basement membrane (anti-GBM) disease with rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis and concurrent parainfluenza pneumonia. Circulating anti-GBM antibodies were barely detectable and disappeared rapidly following corticosteroids, cyclophosphamide and plasma exchange. Kidney biopsy demonstrated strong linear GBM staining for IgG and IgG4 and unusually prominent endocapillary hypercellularity, suggesting 'atypical anti-GBM disease', although glomerular necrosis and crescents were also seen. When kidney function deteriorated further, despite persistently absent circulating anti-GBM antibodies, a repeat kidney biopsy was performed, showing crescents in 100% of glomeruli with ongoing endocapillary hypercellularity and strong IgG and IgG4 GBM staining. This case highlights complexities in the diagnosis of anti-GBM disease, with clinical and histological features bridging the atypical to typical anti-GBM disease spectrum. We hypothesise that these findings might be explained by the presence of IgG4 (rather than traditional IgG1 or IgG3) autoantibodies. To our knowledge, this is also the first report of parainfluenza associated with anti-GBM disease.

### Basic and translational concepts of immune-mediated glomerular diseases [^113oLwQ3]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2012). Low credibility.

Genetically modified immune responses to infections and self-antigens initiate most forms of GN by generating pathogen- and danger-associated molecular patterns that stimulate Toll-like receptors and complement. These innate immune responses activate circulating monocytes and resident glomerular cells to release inflammatory mediators and initiate adaptive, antigen-specific immune responses that collectively damage glomerular structures. CD4 T cells are needed for B cell-driven antibody production that leads to immune complex formation in glomeruli, complement activation, and injury induced by both circulating inflammatory and resident glomerular effector cells. Th17 cells can also induce glomerular injury directly. In this review, information derived from studies in vitro, well characterized experimental models, and humans summarize and update likely pathogenic mechanisms involved in human diseases presenting as nephritis (postinfectious GN, IgA nephropathy, antiglomerular basement membrane and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-mediated crescentic GN, lupus nephritis, type I membranoproliferative GN), and nephrotic syndrome (minimal change/FSGS, membranous nephropathy, and C3 glomerulopathies). Advances in understanding the immunopathogenesis of each of these entities offer many opportunities for future therapeutic interventions.

Anti-glomerular basement membrane (anti-GBM) antibodies are the hallmark of anti-GBM disease, which is characterized by rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis. We describe the case of a 58-year-old woman who presented with rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis with typical anti-GBM staining found by means of direct immunofluorescence microscopy, associated with linear immunoglobin G deposits on tubules. Serum analysis showed circulating anti-tubular basement membrane antibodies, but failed to detect anti-GBM antibodies. Immunoblotting showed that serum antibodies reacted with a 59-kd antigen found along both the GBM and tubular basement membrane.

### Goodpasture syndrome and anti-glomerular basement membrane disease [^113YdcHC]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Anti-glomerular basement membrane (anti-GBM) disease is a rare life-threatening small vessel vasculitis that typically affects the capillaries of kidneys and lungs, with most of patients developing rapidly progressive crescentic glomerulonephritis, and 40%-60% concomitant alveolar haemorrhage. It is caused by the deposition in alveolar and glomerular basement membrane of circulating autoantibodies directed against antigens intrinsic to the basement membrane. The exact mechanism that induces the formation of autoantibodies is unknown, but probably environmental factors, infections or direct damage to kidneys and lungs may trigger the autoimmune response in genetically susceptible individuals. Initial therapy includes corticosteroids and cyclophosphamide to prevent autoantibodies production, and plasmapheresis to remove the circulating autoantibodies. Good renal outcomes may be achieved by a prompt treatment initiation. However, when patients present with severe renal failure requiring dialysis or with a high proportion of glomerular crescents at biopsy, renal outcomes are bad. Relapses are rare and when renal involvement is present, the suspect of concomitant diseases, such as ANCA-associated vasculitis and membranous nephropathy, should be raised. Imlifidase is showing promising results, which if confirmed will cause a paradigm shift in the treatment of this disease.

### Anti-glomerular basement membrane disease: recent updates [^112nQaeD]. Advances in Kidney Disease and Health (2024). Medium credibility.

Anti-glomerular basement membrane disease is a small-vessel vasculitis involving the kidneys (∼90%) and the lungs (∼60%). Antibodies against the glomerular basement membrane are directly pathogenic in anti-glomerular basement membrane disease; however, recent research has highlighted the critical role of T cells. Novel autoantigens within the glomerular basement membrane are also now recognized. Atypical forms of the disease are reported along with preceding triggers, such as immune checkpoint inhibitors, immunomodulatory drugs, and vaccines. Kidney outcomes in anti-glomerular basement membrane disease remain poor despite significant improvement in patient survival in the last 2 to 3 decades. Treatment typically relies on combined plasmapheresis with intensive immunosuppression. Dialysis dependency at presentation is a dominant predictor of kidney outcome. Histologically, a low (< 10%) percentage of normal glomeruli, 100% crescents, together with dialysis dependency at presentation, is associated with poor kidney outcomes. In such cases, an individualized approach weighing the risks and benefits of treatment is recommended. There is a need for better ways to stop the toxic inflammatory activity associated with this disease. In this narrative review, we discuss recent updates on the pathogenesis and management of anti-glomerular basement membrane disease relevant to patients of all ages.

The varying clinical manifestations and atypical presentation can obscure accurate diagnosis, necessitating a comprehensive understanding of the disease's mechanisms, diagnostic criteria, and treatment approaches. This case report outlines a patient presenting with edema and kidney dysfunction, later diagnosed with atypical anti-GBM disease. As we embark on an in-depth exploration of this enigmatic case, we endeavor to unravel the intricate connections between the diverse clinical features, laboratory findings, and potential underlying pathophysiology. By delving into the complexities of this presentation, we hope to contribute to the evolving understanding of atypical clinical scenarios, thereby enriching the realm of medical knowledge and clinical practice.

### Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies [^112MvxvR]. Lancet (2006). Excellent credibility.

Much like other autoantibodies (eg, anti-double stranded DNA in systemic lupus erythematosus or antiglomerular basement membrane antibodies in Goodpasture's syndrome), antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) have provided doctors with a useful serological test to assist in diagnosis of small-vessel vasculitides, including Wegener's granulomatosis, microscopic polyangiitis, Churg-Strauss syndrome, and their localised forms (eg, pauci-immune necrotising and crescentic glomerulonephritis). 85–95% of patients with Wegener's granulomatosis, microscopic polyangiitis, and pauci-immune necrotising and crescentic glomerulonephritis have serum ANCA. ANCA directed to either proteinase 3 or myeloperoxidase are clinically relevant, yet the relevance of other ANCA remains unknown. Besides their diagnostic potential, ANCA might be valuable in disease monitoring. In addition, data seem to confirm the long-disputed pathogenic role of these antibodies. Present treatments for ANCA-associated vasculitis are not free from side-effects and as many as 50% of patients relapse within 5 years. Accurate understanding of the key pathogenic points of ANCA-associated vasculitis can undoubtedly provide a more rational therapeutic approach.

### Advances in human antiglomerular basement membrane disease [^115LS55h]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2011). Medium credibility.

Antiglomerular basement membrane (anti-GBM) disease is an autoimmune disorder that mostly presents as raised titers of antibodies against the GBM, rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis and pulmonary hemorrhage. The disease is caused by antibodies against noncollagenous domain of α3 chain of type IV collagen, which contains the epitopes E(A) and E(B). The humoral and cellular immunity contributing to the initiation of anti-GBM disease has been extensively studied as a model for autoimmune diseases, although most of the data come from animal studies. The disease is rare, but diagnoses have been made in hundreds of patients. Substantial advances have been made in the understanding of human anti-GBM disease, and it can be treated successfully. In this Review we summarize the current knowledge on the prevalence, clinical manifestations, treatment and outcomes of human anti-GBM disease. We discuss findings on pathogenesis from human studies, with close attention to disease initiation and the immunological features of progression from quiescent autoimmune homeostasis in healthy individuals to fulminant anti-GBM disease. Further studies on autoreactive T cells are expected to clarify specific features of human anti-GBM disease and could lead to the development of new therapies.

### Autoimmune kidney diseases [^114TgVr9]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

The second most common cause of chronic renal failure is glomerulonephritis, which is a collective term used for numerous diseases with the common denominator of histological renal inflammation emanating from the glomerular tuft. Whether all forms of glomerulonephritis should be considered as autoimmune disease is debatable, but immune mechanisms are important in all of them. This review focuses on four relatively well delineated forms of primary glomerulonephritis: Goodpastures or anti-GBM disease, IgA nephritis, membranous nephropathy and membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis. The autoantibodies are directed either to molecules within the glomeruli, such as the glomerular basement membrane in anti-GBM disease and to the podocytes in membranous glomerulonephritis, or to components of the immune system such as C3 convertase in membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis and IgA in IgA nephritis. Differences in diagnostic practices and classification controversies obscure comparative epidemiological studies, but there seem to be huge differences between incidence rates between countries and over time, both genetic factors and infections seem to matter but strong indications for a role of other environmental factors are still lacking.

### Development of anti-glomerular basement membrane glomerulonephritis during the course of IgA nephropathy: a case report [^116TVPMz]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Anti-glomerular basement membrane (GBM) glomerulonephritis does not usually coexist with another glomerulonephritis such as IgA nephropathy. We present a rare case having a combination of these two diseases, and furthermore, histological evaluation could be performed before and after the development of anti-GBM glomerulonephritis over a period of only10 months.

Case presentation

A 66-year-old woman was admitted with complaints of microscopic hematuria and mild proteinuria for the past 3 years. Serum creatinine level was normal at that time. The first renal biopsy was performed. Light microscopy revealed mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis with fibro-cellular crescents in one out of 18 glomeruli, excluding one global sclerotic glomerulus. Immunofluorescence (IF) showed IgA and C3 deposition in the mesangium. Therefore, the diagnosis was IgA nephropathy. Eight months later, the patient's serum creatinine suddenly rose to 4.53 mg/dL and urinalysis showed 100 red blood cells per high power field with nephrotic range proteinuria (12.3 g/g Cr). The serological tests revealed the presence of anti-GBM antibody at the titer of 116 IU/mL. Treatments were begun after admission, consisting of hemodialysis, plasma exchange, and intravenous methylprednisolone pulse therapy. At 4 weeks after admission, the second renal biopsy was performed. Light microscopy revealed crescents in 18 of 25 glomeruli, excluding six global sclerotic glomeruli. IF showed linear IgG deposition along the GBM in addition to granular IgA and C3 deposition. Based on these findings, the diagnosis of anti-GBM glomerulonephritis and IgA nephropathy was confirmed. Renal function was not restored despite treatment, but alveolar hemorrhage was prevented.

Conclusions

We report a patient with a diagnosis of anti-GBM disease during the course of IgA nephropathy. This case strongly suggests that the presence of autoantibodies should be checked to rule out overlapping autoimmune conditions even in patient who have previously been diagnosed with chronic glomerulonephritis, such as IgA nephropathy, who present an unusually rapid clinical course.

### Atypical anti-glomerular basement membrane disease with membranous hyperplasia: diagnostic challenges and treatment variability [^111DaosN]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Anti-glomerular basement membrane disease (anti-GBM disease) is a form of small-vessel vasculitis characterized by the deposition of circulating anti-GBM antibodies within kidney and/or lung tissue. This condition is characterized by the deposition of circulating anti-GBM antibodies within the basement membranes of glomeruli and, at times, the pulmonary alveoli, leading to rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis and, occasionally, pulmonary hemorrhage. However, the clinical and pathological manifestations of anti-GBM disease are not uniform across all cases. Classic anti-GBM disease, often referred to as Goodpasture's syndrome, primarily involves the kidneys and lungs. The autoimmune response targets the alpha-3 chain of type IV collagen, a major component of glomerular and alveolar basement membranes. The ensuing immune complex deposition triggers a cascade of inflammation, resulting in crescentic glomerulonephritis and, in severe cases, pulmonary hemorrhage. Rapid diagnosis and intervention are essential for favorable outcomes, typically relying on the detection of circulating anti-GBM antibodies and subsequent kidney biopsy to assess disease extent.

Atypical anti-GBM disease is a rare and intriguing kidney disorder that presents with unique clinical and diagnostic challenges. Unlike classical anti-GBM disease, atypical cases deviate from the conventional presentation, making timely diagnosis and effective management paramount. Atypical anti-GBM disease typically exhibits milder clinical manifestations. Firstly, unlike the 34–62% incidence of pulmonary hemorrhage observed in typical anti-GBM disease, atypical cases often lack pulmonary hemorrhage. Notably, Nasr et al. have reported none of the 20 patients with atypical anti-GBM disease presented with pulmonary hemorrhage. Secondly, kidney damage in atypical anti-GBM disease tends to be less severe, primarily characterized by hematuria, proteinuria, and mild kidney insufficiency. This stands in contrast to the acute progressive nephritis syndrome observed in typical anti-GBM disease. The serum creatinine for patients with atypical anti-GBM disease was 2.2 mg/dL, and none of them required dialysis. This suggests that kidney damage is notably milder in comparison to patients with typical anti-GBM disease. Lastly, individuals with atypical anti-GBM disease commonly exhibit negative or low titers of anti-GBM antibodies circulating in their blood, in contrast to patients with typical anti-GBM disease who demonstrate a positive rate ranging from 65–100%.

### Crescentic glomerulonephritis with Anti-GBM antibody but no glomerular deposition [^114abcyA]. BMC Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion and conclusions

In this case series we present four patients with a pauci-immune rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis with anti-GBM antibodies, two with high titre, but without linear deposition of antibody on the basement membrane. The relevance of the anti-GBM antibodies in such patients has not been focussed on previously. While pauci-immune vasculitis lacking ANCA is a well-recognised phenomenon representing between 27 and 38% of pauci-immune GN, none have been reported with circulating anti-GBM antibodies.

All patients presented with non-specific prodromal symptoms and significant kidney injury. In three out of the four there was a substantial improvement in kidney function following therapy, while one patient remained dialysis dependant.

Anti-GBM antibodies are considered diagnostic for Goodpasture's disease and it has been suggested that the level of anti-GBM antibodies correlates with long term prognosis. In addition, there are case reports of low levels of anti-GBM antibodies being associated with an indolent disease process. Anti-GBM antibodies are found in co-existence with ANCA in up to 5% of ANCA positive subjects and in one series all of the biopsied patients showed evidence of linear antibody deposition. It is notable that 18% of these double positive patients reported were not biopsied, meaning that some may have had lacked linear staining on the GBM as we have described. Interestingly, none of the patients described with creatinine levels > 500 μmol/ recovered kidney function following immunosuppression with or without adjunctive plasma exchange. This is in contrast with our patients in whom kidney function recovery was found in the majority.

### ANCA in Anti-GBM disease: moving beyond a one-dimensional clinical phenotype [^115ZSpnb]. Kidney International (2017). Low credibility.

McAdoo et al. propose that patients with both circulating antiglomerular basement membrane antibody and antineutrophil cytoplasm antibody demonstrate a phenotype that lies between that of single-positive antiglomerular basement membrane disease and antineutrophil cytoplasm antibody-associated vasculitis. Specifically, there may be a subset of "double-positives" that have a more favorable response to therapy. These observations, along with reports of "atypical" antiglomerular basement membrane disease, challenge us to look beyond antiglomerular basement membrane disease as a 1-dimensional entity, and better characterize its clinical spectrum.

### Clinicopathological features and outcome of antibody-negative anti-glomerular basement membrane disease [^115wgssR]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2019). Medium credibility.

Aim

To explore the clinicopathological characteristics of patients with anti-GBM antibody-negative anti-GBM disease.

Methods

The clinical and renal pathological findings were retrospectively studied in 19 patients. All patients met the following inclusion criteria: linear GBM IgG deposition on immunofluorescence(IF); and lack of serum anti-GBM antibodies by ELISA and indirect immunofluorescence assay.

Results

There were 17 male and two female patients, with a median age of 36 years (range 15–61 years). Hypertension was present in 68% of cases, nephrotic-range proteinuria (> 3.5g/24 hours) in 42%, nephrotic syndrome in 37%, microhaematuria in 95%, renal insufficiency in 63% and lung involvement in 16%. On biopsy all patients had linear GBM staining for polyclonal IgG by IF. The dominant IgG subtype was IgG4 or IgG1. By light microscopy, mesangial proliferative GN without crescents was seen in four patients; proliferative GN (mesangial proliferative GN in eight; endocapillary proliferative GN in two; and membranoproliferative GN in two) with crescents (focal in 11; diffuse in one) in 12 patients; and crescentic GN without mesangial or endocapillary proliferative or membranoproliferative changes in three patients. By electron microscopy, six patients showed scarce electron dense deposits in glomeruli and 11 patients had global podocyte effacement. Totally, 10 (53%) patients received immunosuppressive therapy. The median follow-up was 15 months and six (32%) patients progressed to end-stage renal disease.

Conclusions

Anti-GBM antibody-negative anti-GBM disease was different from classic anti-GBM disease clinically and pathologically. The pathogenesis of the renal injury in these patients has not been elucidated until now and it should be studied and identified further.

### The uncertain significance of anti-glomerular basement membrane antibody among HIV-infected persons with kidney disease [^111csmBJ]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Glomerular lesions that complicate patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection include HIV-associated nephropathy, membranous glomerulopathy, and immune-complex glomerulonephritides. This case series presents 3 patients with clinically significant renal disease and positive test results for anti-glomerular basement membrane (anti-GBM) antigen. Characteristic histological findings that would suggest anti-GBM antibodies have a significant role in the pathological state of each patient's kidney disease were absent. In addition, each patient recovered without specific treatment for anti-GBM disease. This case series suggests that anti-GBM antibodies likely are related to the B-cell expansion previously described in patients with HIV infection. We propose that clinicians interpret results of anti-GBM antibody tests carefully for patients with HIV infection, considering biopsy before empiric therapy, particularly in a clinical presentation that is atypical for Goodpasture disease.

### Diagnosis of membranous nephropathy with Anti-GBM glomerulonephritis: a case series report [^116dkGAM]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Membranous nephropathy (MN) is a common cause of nephrotic syndrome in adults, and it is characterized by the presence of subepithelial immune complexes followed by complement activation, basement membrane damage, and proteinuria. Fibrinoid necrosis and crescent formation are rarely encountered with MN. MN with crescents may occur as a "dual glomerulopathy" with superimposed antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated crescentic glomerulonephritis or, less often, anti-glomerular basement membrane (anti-GBM) antibodies. The combination of MN and anti-GBM disease has been well documented since the first report in 1974. This dual glomerulopathy likely represents the coincidental occurrence of two separate disease processes, MN followed by anti-GBM disease or the simultaneous presence of the two diseases. Occasionally, anti-GBM followed by MN has also been reported in individual cases.

We report 3 cases on MN with anti-GBM disease and analyzed their clinical and pathological characteristics. The correct diagnosis of MN with anti-GBM disease should rely on a combination of renal biopsy findings and serological testing.

### SARS-CoV-2 infection and recurrence of anti-glomerular basement disease: a case report [^115gXFgB]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Anti-glomerular basement disease (anti-GBM disease) is a rare small-vessel vasculitis. Characterized by the presence of circulating antibodies directed against the non-collagen NC1 domain of the alpha3 chain of collagen type IV in glomerular and alveolar basement membranes, the disease manifests as rapidly progressive crescentic glomerulonephritis and, in 40 to 60% of cases, with pulmonary haemorrhage.

Recently, a report from London described a five-fold increased incidence of anti-GBM disease during the coronavirus pandemic. Four of the eight reported cases tested positive for SARS-Cov-2 IgM antibodies. We here report the case of a young woman who experienced a recurrence of anti-GBM disease following an infection with the new coronavirus.

### Rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis [^113m1NsT]. Advances in Kidney Disease and Health (2024). Medium credibility.

Rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (RPGN) is a syndrome characterized by a swift decline in kidney function, often over a few months, accompanied by features of nephritic syndrome. It can result in decreased urine output and commonly involves the presence of extensive crescents in kidney biopsies. RPGN is classified into 3 main types based on immune deposit distribution and visualization through immunofluorescence and electron microscopy: antiglomerular basement membrane disease, immune complex glomerulonephritis, and pauci-immune glomerulonephritis. Early diagnosis and prompt treatment are critical to prevent progression to ESRD. Standard treatment options for RPGN include glucocorticoids, cyclophosphamide, or rituximab, with plasma exchange especially important for antiglomerular basement membrane disease and select cases of ANCA-associated vasculitis. Clinical trials for glomerular diseases have primarily excluded patients with RPGN or dialysis dependence. Establishment of clinical registries is required for the optimization of therapeutic protocols for the treatment of RPGN.

### The clinicopathologic characteristics and outcome of atypical anti-glomerular basement membrane nephritis [^114Seggp]. Kidney International (2016). Low credibility.

Classic anti-glomerular basement membrane (GBM) disease presents with rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (GN) with or without pulmonary hemorrhage. On biopsy typical disease displays bright polytypic linear GBM staining for IgG by immunofluorescence and diffuse crescentic/necrotizing GN on light microscopy. Here, we studied 20 patients with atypical anti-GBM nephritis typified by bright linear GBM staining for immunoglobulins but without a diffuse crescentic phenotype. Patients had hematuria, proteinuria, and mild renal insufficiency, without pulmonary hemorrhage. Light microscopy showed endocapillary proliferative GN in 9 patients, mesangial proliferative GN in 6, membranoproliferative GN in 3, and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis with mesangial hypercellularity in 2. Eight of the 20 showed features of microangiopathy. Crescents/necrosis were absent in 12 and were focal in 8 patients. Bright linear GBM staining for IgG was seen in 17 patients, IgM in 2, and IgA in 1 patient, which was polytypic in 10 patients and monotypic in 10 patients. No circulating α3NC1 antibodies were detected by commercial ELISA. The 1-year patient and renal survival rates were 93% and 85%, respectively. Thus, atypical anti-GBM nephritis is a rare variant of anti-GBM disease characterized clinically by an indolent course, no pulmonary involvement, and undetectable circulating α3NC1 antibodies. Further studies are needed to characterize the molecular architecture of GBM autoantigens in these patients and establish optimal therapy.

### Use of rituximab as an induction therapy in anti-glomerular basement-membrane disease [^1129H7NY]. BMC Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Anti-glomerular basement-membrane (anti-GBM) disease (or Goodpasture disease) is characterized by severe kidney and lung involvement. Prognoses have improved with treatments that combine plasma exchange and immunosuppressive drugs. However, patients with severe renal involvement can have poor renal outcomes and cyclophosphamide can cause significant complications. Anti-GBM antibodies have a direct pathogenic effect on the disease: thus, therapeutics that can decrease their production, such as rituximab, could be a good alternative.

Methods

The medical files of five patients that had received rituximab as a first-line therapy (instead of cyclophosphamide), plus plasma exchange and steroids, were reviewed. All patients had severe disease manifestations.

Results

Four patients required dialysis at diagnosis and remained dialysis-dependent over the mean follow-up of 15 months. Three patients had pulmonary involvement, but recovered even though mechanical ventilation was required. Anti-GBM antibodies became rapidly undetectable in all patients. One infectious and two hematological complications were observed.

Conclusions

We report the outcomes of five patients with Goodpasture disease and treated with rituximab as a first-line treatment. This strategy was effective at treating pulmonary manifestations and was associated with a good biological response with no major serious adverse events. However, renal outcomes were not significantly improved.

### Anti-glomerular basement membrane disease [^115Xtrq5]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Anti-glomerular basement membrane (anti-GBM) disease is a rare small vessel vasculitis that affects the capillary beds of the kidneys and lungs. It is an archetypic autoimmune disease, caused by the development of directly pathogenic autoantibodies targeting a well characterized autoantigen expressed in the basement membranes of these organs, although the inciting events that induce the autoimmune response are not fully understood. The recent confirmation of spatial and temporal clustering of cases suggests that environmental factors, including infection, may trigger disease in genetically susceptible individuals. The majority of patients develop widespread glomerular crescent formation, presenting with features of rapidly progressive GN, and 40%-60% will have concurrent alveolar hemorrhage. Treatment aims to rapidly remove pathogenic autoantibody, typically with the use of plasma exchange, along with steroids and cytotoxic therapy to prevent ongoing autoantibody production and tissue inflammation. Retrospective cohort studies suggest that when this combination of treatment is started early, the majority of patients will have good renal outcome, although presentation with oligoanuria, a high proportion of glomerular crescents, or kidney failure requiring dialysis augur badly for renal prognosis. Relapse and recurrent disease after kidney transplantation are both uncommon, although de novo anti-GBM disease after transplantation for Alport syndrome is a recognized phenomenon. Copresentation with other kidney diseases such as ANCA-associated vasculitis and membranous nephropathy seems to occur at a higher frequency than would be expected by chance alone, and in addition atypical presentations of anti-GBM disease are increasingly reported. These observations highlight the need for future work to further delineate the immunopathogenic mechanisms of anti-GBM disease, and how to better refine and improve treatments, particularly for patients presenting with adverse prognostic factors.

### Recurrence of goodpasture syndrome without circulating anti-glomerular basement membrane antibodies after kidney transplant, a case report [^115LBptF]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Table 1
List of the different assays used to test the patient's serum. All were negative

The negative results of the serological tests can be explained by different reasons, particularly: (a) lack of sensitivity of the assay, especially for low-affinity antibodies; (b) specific isotypes or sub-classes of anti-GBM antibodies (IgA or IgG4) that are not easily detected in ELISA or radioimmunoassays; (c) disappearance of the antibodies from the circulation before the disease resolution; (d) very low levels of low-affinity antibodies due to the removal from circulation of high-affinity antibodies by an 'immunological sink'; (e) antibodies that are highly specific for human GBM, and not for non-human (non-primate) antigens; (f) loss of lymphocyte T helpers that are required for the lymphocyte B response, resulting in the decline of auto-antibody production; and (g) antibodies specific for other collagen subtypes that are not detected with the usual assays (e.g. alpha5(IV)NC1, alpha-4NC1…). The subsequent IgG subtype analysis in the transplant biopsy (showing IgG1 and a majority of IgG4) suggests the presence of a specific sub-class of anti-GBM antibodies that could not be detected by the used tests. New assays to detect rare subtypes of anti-GBM antibodies are needed.

Finally, we would like to emphasize the need of practical guidelines for patients with kidney biopsy-proven GS and seronegative anti-GBM assays to improve their follow-up and decrease the risk of GS recurrence after kidney transplantation. Indeed, the impossibility to evaluate the disease activity exposes to the risk, as illustrated in this case, of recurrence in the kidney graft. Apart from quitting smoking, which is a recognized risk factor, the usual recommendations for patients with circulating anti-GBM antibodies (delay between diagnosis and transplant, level of immunosuppression…) cannot be applied to seronegative patients.

Discussion

Anti-GBM diseases are rare spectrum of autoimmune disorders characterized by circulating anti-GBM antibodies that deposit in kidney and/or lung tissues, potentially resulting in kidney damage and/or pulmonary hemorrhage. The target antigen in this context is the non-collagenous domains of the α3(IV)NC1 and α5(IV)NC1 in the GBM.

In the development of anti-GBM disease, the immunological characteristics of anti-GBM antibodies play a crucial role in its pathogenicity. This involves a gradual increase in titer, the progressive emergence and amplification of IgG1 subtypes, and a shift in target antigens recognized by the antibodies. Initially limited to α3(IV)NC1 and α5(IV)NC1, the antibodies eventually come to recognize all five target antigens from α1 to α5(IV)NC1. Plasma exchange has proven effective in removing circulating antibodies, leading to the recovery of pulmonary hemorrhage and kidney function. Recently, there has been the identification of atypical anti-GBM disease, which presents some unique features. Despite revealing typical immunoglobulin deposition along the GBM lineage in kidney immunofluorescence, the serum tests negative for anti-GBM antibodies. Furthermore, the clinical manifestations, serologic and pathologic features, and prognosis of atypical anti-GBM disease differ from those of the typical variant, suggesting the possibility of distinct underlying pathogenic mechanisms.

Our patient exhibited pathological features such as diffuse and globular deposition of IgG along capillary loops, diffuse and homogeneously thickened basement membranes, crescent formation (62.5%), moderate-to-severe hyperplasia of mesangial cells, and the visible insertion of mesangial membranes. Additionally, nodular changes were evident in the form of double-track formation. Considering the clinical presentation alongside multiple negative laboratory indicators for anti-GBM antibodies, we concluded that the case involved atypical anti-GBM disease combined with membrane hyperplasia. The absence of electron-dense material in the ultrastructure excluded the possibility of membranoproliferative nephropathy in conjunction with crescent formation.

The linear IgG deposition in atypical anti-GBM disease may be due to an abnormal GBM or non-traditional characteristics of the antibody-binding sites. The phenomenon of "serum negativity" for anti-GBM antibodies could be explained by an "immunological sink", wherein high-affinity antibodies are selectively sequestered from the circulation, leaving behind low-affinity antibodies undetectable by standard ELISA. This hypothesis is indirectly supported by the fact that when anti-GBM disease was first identified in 1967, it was found that circulating anti-GBM antibodies increased rapidly when patients underwent bilateral nephrectomy.

### A case of aggressive atypical Anti-GBM disease complicated by CMV pneumonitis [^113kSNdT]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Anti-glomerular basement membrane (anti-GBM) disease is a rare disease, characterized by circulating IgG anti-GBM antibodies, a rapidly progressive crescentic glomerulonephritis, with 30–60% of patients also developing pulmonary hemorrhage due to cross-reactivity of antibodies with alveolar basement membranes. The combination of pulmonary hemorrhage and rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis was first described by Dr. Ernest W. Goodpasture in 1919 in the influenza pandemic at the end of World War I. The diagnosis of anti-GBM disease is typically made by immunofluorescence (IF) for IgG (IgG1 dominant) demonstrating linear staining of glomerular basement membranes and focal linear staining of tubular basement membranes, and the serologic presence of anti-GBM antibodies. Recently, atypical cases of anti-GBM disease characterized by negative serology for circulating anti-GBM antibodies and unusual histology have been reported.

In most patients, the anti-GBM antibodies are directed against the NC1 domain of the alpha-3 chain of type IV collagen, resulting in activation of the complement cascade and tissue injury typical of a type 2 immune response. Light microscopic findings of renal biopsies usually include severe necrotizing and crescentic glomerulonephritis involving the majority of glomeruli, with lesions in the glomerular basement membranes but the absence of significant endocapillary or mesangial proliferation. Serum creatinine levels at diagnosis have been highly correlated with the percentage of crescentic glomeruli seen on biopsy, and patients with serum creatinine over 4 mg/dL (354 μmol/L), oliguria, and over 50% crescents on biopsy rarely recover renal function.

Treatment of anti-GBM glomerulonephritis involves high dose steroids, and cyclophosphamide for inhibition of antibody production and rebound hypersynthesis, along with plasma exchange for removal of circulating antibodies. Rituximab can be used in combination with cyclophosphamide if initial treatment fails. Recurrence of hemoptysis may not necessarily represent disease refractory to treatment, and superimposed infections such as noted by Chan et al. and Hasegawa et al. must be considered before increasing the intensity of immunosuppression.

We present a case of a 24-year-old male with atypical anti-GBM disease, marked by undetectable anti-GBM antibodies and unusual biopsy findings, who developed a relapse of pulmonary hemorrhage. After lack of response to immunosuppression, the hemorrhage was found to be most likely due to a cytomegalovirus (CMV) pneumonitis.

### Anti-glomerular basement membrane vasculitis [^112Rbbvw]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Antiglomerular basement membrane disease (anti-GBM) is a rare life-threatening autoimmune vasculitis that involves small vessels and it is characterized by circulating autoantibodies directed against type IV collagen antigens expressed in glomerular and alveolar basement membrane. The typical clinical manifestations are the rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis and the alveolar hemorrhage. The diagnosis is usually confirmed by the detection of anti-GBM circulating antibodies. If not rapidly recognized, anti-GBM disease can lead to end stage kidney disease (ESKD). An early diagnosis and prompt treatment with immunosuppressive therapies and plasmapheresis are crucial to prevent a poor outcome. In this review, we discuss the primary form of anti-GBM (the so called Goodpasture syndrome) but also cases associated with other autoimmune diseases such as antineutrophil-cytoplasmic-antibody (ANCA) vasculitis, membranous nephropathy, IgA nephritis and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), as well as the few cases of anti-GBM vasculitis complicating kidney transplantation in the Alport syndrome.

### Update on antiglomerular basement membrane disease [^1126wGec]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Antiglomerular basement membrane (GBM) disease is a rare form of autoimmune glomerulonephritis often accompanied by lung haemorrhage and characterized by circulating and deposited antibodies that bind basement membrane type IV collagen antigens in the glomerulus and lung alveolus. We review recent findings regarding disease pathogenesis and therapy.

Recent Findings

The target autoantigens are the noncollagenous (NC1) regions of the α3 and to a lesser extent the α5-chains of type IV collagen, which are exposed following disruption of the α3-α4-α5 collagen heterotrimer allowing autoantibody binding. In addition, antigen-specific T cells are found in the circulation of acute patients at higher frequencies than in healthy controls. These are prevented from inducing damage in healthy individuals or during disease remission, by α3(IV)NC1-specific Treg and possibly through destructive antigen processing of autoreactive peptides. Drugs inducing lymphocyte depletion, such as alemtuzumab, may disrupt these natural lymphocyte regulatory processes and promote disease. With regards to therapy, few advances have been made, with the exception of isolated case reports of the use of rituximab and mycophenolate mofetil in resistant disease.

Summary

Immunity towards the α3(IV) NC1 is effectively regulated in health but conformational changes in the antigen, alterations in its processing, modifications of B cells and Tregs, following certain environmental events, in susceptible individuals, promote disease induction.

### Crescentic glomerulonephritis with Anti-GBM antibody but no glomerular deposition [^114mjr1S]. BMC Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Anti-GBM antibodies, are highly specific and sensitive for Goodpasture's (anti-GBM) disease. Antibodies are generally directed against the NC1 domain of the alpha 3 chain of type IV collagen(α3 (IV)) and less commonly, toward the α 4(IV) or α 5(IV) chains, which together form a triple helical structure in glomerular and alveolar basement membranes. Anti-GBM disease typically presents with a rapidly progressive crescentic glomerulonephritis (CGN) and pulmonary haemorrhage in approximately half of the patients. Despite the high specificity and sensitivity of the antibody tests, 'false' positive' tests are reported in patients with polyclonal immunoglobulin responses following viral infections or drugs, but without CGN. The gold standard for diagnosis is the kidney biopsy, demonstrating diffuse CGN with linear immunoglobulin staining along the GBM. Linear GBM immunoglobulin binding is also found in the elderly and in diabetic patients, although not in the context of CGN possibly due to changes in glycation patterns of the GBM antigens. Additionally, atypical cases of anti-GBM disease have been reported, such as patients who lack circulating antibodies, detected using conventional assays, but with linear glomerular deposition on biopsy, in some cases without CGN, in others with mesangial proliferative or endocapillary glomerulonephritis. Circulating anti-GBM antibodies are detected in approximately 5–10% of sera from patients with anti-neutrophil cytoplasm antibody(ANCA) positive vasculitis, in some at lower titre than in patients with Goodpasture's disease. Experimental models have shown that low dose anti-GBM antibodies, that themselves do not induce CGN, can synergise with ANCA to augment glomerulonephritis, without development of linear anti-GBM staining. The synergy is in part due to increased production of glomerular cytokines and chemokines, as well as glomerular neutrophil activation. Here we present a cohort of four patients with circulating anti-GBM antibodies, two with high titre, and three with low level ANCA, all with CGN and no evidence of linear anti-GBM staining by immunohistochemistry or immunofluorescence. In all cases, sera bound recombinant α3 (IV), and two that were tested bound collagenase solubilised human GBM, while two also bound primate glomeruli. These data suggest that not all anti-GBM antibodies have similar pathogenic potential because some cannot bind their host GBM under normal circumstances.

Anti-glomerular basement membrane (anti-GBM) disease is a rare autoimmune small vessel vasculitis characterized by autoreactivity to antigens in type IV collagen chains expressed in glomerular and alveolar basement membrane. The detection of circulating anti-GBM antibodies, which are shown to be directly pathogenic, is central to disease diagnosis. Clinically, anti-GBM disease usually presents with rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis with or without alveolar hemorrhage. Rapid diagnosis and early treatment are required to prevent mortality and to preserve renal function. Relapse in anti-GBM disease is uncommon. Variant and atypical forms of anti-GBM disease are increasingly recognised.

### Atypical anti-glomerular basement membrane disease with Anti-GBM antibody negativity and ANCA positivity: a case report [^113TFXhr]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Anti-glomerular basement membrane (anti-GBM) disease, or Goodpasture syndrome, is an organ-specific autoimmune disease that involves the lung and kidneys and leads to the rapid progression of glomerulonephritis, with or without diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, and even respiratory failure. Classic cases of anti-GBM disease are diagnosed based on the presence of anti-GBM antibodies in serum samples and kidney or lung biopsy tissue samples. However, atypical cases of anti-GBM disease are also seen in clinical practice. The case of the patient presented here, whose biopsy specimen analysis showed 100% crescents and immunoglobulin G (IgG) linearly deposited alongside the GBM and who repeatedly tested negative for serum anti-GBM antibodies but positive for the anti-myeloperoxidase (MPO) antibody (p-ANCA) and another atypical ANCA, is unusual. Insights from this unusual case might help clinicians identify unusual features of glomerulonephritis and administer proper treatments in a timely manner.

### Clinical guidelines for post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis… [^112ie3aB]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis can occur after streptococcal pharyngitis or skin infections.
- PSGN often requires hospitalization, but mild or subclinical cases can occur.
- The prognosis for PSGN is good, especially for children.
- Treatment focuses on symptom management and giving antibiotics.
- Follow recommended guidelines when caring for patients with PSGN. Cause PSGN is caused by certain strains of Streptococcus pyogenes. These bacteria are also called group A Streptococcus. As sequela of streptococcal pharyngitis or pyoderma, PSGN is characterized as
- Delayed
- Immunologically mediated
- Nonsuppurative Keep ReadingGroup A Strep Bacteria and How They Spread. Latent period Following group A strep pharyngitis: PSGN occurs after a latent period of approximately 10 days. Following streptococcal skin infections: PSGN occurs up to 3 weeks later.

Risk factors There are no known risk factors specific for PSGN. PSGN is more common in children, particularly pre-school and early school aged children. However, it can also occur in adults. Risk factors for PSGN are the same as for the preceding infection: Laboratory findings Laboratory examination usually reveals:

- Mild normocytic normochromic anemia
- Slight hypoproteinemia
- Elevated blood urea nitrogen and creatinine
- Elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate
- Low total hemolytic complement and C3 complement Patients usually have decreased urine output. Urine examination often reveals protein and hemoglobin with red blood cell casts. Diagnosis and testing The differential diagnosis of PSGN includes other infectious and non-infectious causes of acute glomerulonephritis. Clinical history and findings with evidence of a preceding group A strep infection should inform a PSGN diagnosis.

Evidence of preceding group A strep infection can include:

- Isolation of group A strep from the throat
- Isolation of group A strep from skin lesions
- Elevated streptococcal antibodies.

### Anti-glomerular basement membrane glomerulonephritis: a morphologic study of 80 cases [^111gu5QW]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2006). Low credibility.

Anti-glomerular basement membrane (anti-GBM) glomerulonephritis is a rare disease caused by IgG autoantibodies against the glomerular basement membrane. We describe clinical and pathologic findings in a series of renal biopsy specimens from 80 patients. The patients ranged in age from 16 to 87 years. The age distribution was bimodal, with one peak at a young age predominated by males and a second peak in the sixth to eighth decades with females predominating. Most patients (70 [88%]) had severe necrotizing glomerulonephritis with crescents in more that 50% of glomeruli. The fraction of crescentic glomeruli in biopsy specimens correlated well with serum creatinine levels but not with serologic titers for anti-GBM antibodies. Interstitial fibrosis was uncommon and, when present, minimal to mild. Linear IgG deposition defines this entity, but immunofluorescent costaining for other immunoglobulins and complement is found frequently. To our knowledge, this is the largest series of renal biopsy specimens with anti-GBM glomerulonephritis studied to date.

Three young male patients developed acute glomerulonephritis and serious hemoptysis. All three had evidence of antiglomerular basement membrane antibodies in their serum and native kidneys. The pulmonary hemorrhages ceased after bilateral nephrectomy and splenectomy accompanied by irregular treatment with steroids and other immunosuppressants. Renal homotransplantation was successfully carried out from 95 to 162 days later, after circulating anti-GBM antibodies had disappeared. Two of the homografts were biopsied and the third was removed 20, 34, and 2 months posttransplantation, respectively, and contained little or no immunoglobulin. Therefore, Goodpasture's syndrome does not contraindicate renal transplantation under the stipulated conditions of staged therapy. Halgrimson CG, Wilson CB, Dixon FJ, et al.

### Epidemiology, clinical features, risk factors, and outcomes in anti-glomerular basement membrane disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112pK2v1]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Anti-glomerular basement membrane (GBM) disease is a small-vessel vasculitis that represents the most aggressive form of autoimmune glomerulonephritis. The study aimed to investigate the prevalence, clinical characteristics, risk factors, and outcomes of anti-GBM disease through a systematic review and meta-analysis involving 47 studies with 2830 patients. The overall incidence of anti-GBM disease ranged from 0.60 to 1.79 per million population per annum. In rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis and crescentic glomerulonephritis, the pooled incidence rates were 8.0% and 12.8%, respectively. The pooled prevalence rates of anti-GBM antibodies, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA), and lung hemorrhage were 88.8%, 27.4%, and 32.6%, respectively. Patients with combined ANCA positivity demonstrated a prognosis comparable to those patients with only anti-GBM antibodies, though with differing clinical features. The pooled one-year patient and kidney survival rates were 76.2% and 30.2%, respectively. Kidney function on diagnosis and normal glomeruli percentage were identified as strong prognostic factors. This study represents the first comprehensive meta-analysis on anti-GBM disease, providing insights into its management. However, caution is warranted in interpreting some results due to the observational nature of the included studies and high heterogeneity.

### Development of anti-glomerular basement membrane glomerulonephritis during the course of IgA nephropathy: a case report [^117146eE]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Anti-glomerular basement membrane (GBM) glomerulonephritis is an autoimmune glomerular disease that is characterized by linear deposition of IgG along the GBM. The main target of anti-GBM antibody had been shown to lie in the NC1 domain of α3 chains of type IV collagen on the GBM. Histologically, it is associated with extensive crescent formation and clinically with rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (RPGN). There are well-known associations between anti-GBM glomerulonephritis and the presence of antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) and between anti-GBM glomerulonephritis and membranous nephropathy. In a limited number of cases, anti-GBM glomerulonephritis has been associated with IgA nephropathy and other immune complex glomerulonephritis.

Herein, we report a patient with a diagnosis of anti-GBM disease during the course of IgA nephropathy.

Anti-GBM disease — kidney transplantation timing and recurrence specify that kidney transplantation in patients with kidney failure due to anti-GBM disease should be postponed until anti-GBM antibodies remain undetectable for 6 months; recurrence is very low in patients without detectable antibodies, and they should be negative for 6 months prior to transplantation. In patients with Alport syndrome, anti-GBM antibodies to the foreign collagen chain in the transplanted kidney can occur approximately 2% to 3% of cases and can be detected by transplant kidney biopsy.

Half had light chain restriction. The term "idiopathic linear immunoglobulin deposition" may be preferable until anti-GBM activity is demonstrable, since there are alternative mechanisms of linear deposition in the GBM, including physicochemical affinity for GBM components and alterations of the GBM itself.

### Atypical anti-glomerular basement membrane disease with Anti-GBM antibody negativity and ANCA positivity: a case report [^117TNnVG]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Anti-glomerular basement membrane (anti-GBM) disease is an organ-specific autoimmune disease that involves the lung and kidneys and leads to rapid glomerulonephritis progression, with or without diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, and even respiratory failure. Classic cases of anti-GBM disease are diagnosed based on the presence of the anti-GBM antibody in serum samples and kidney or lung biopsy tissue samples. However, atypical cases of anti-GBM disease are also seen in clinical practice.

Case presentation

We herein report the rare case of a patient with atypical anti-GBM disease whose serum was negative for the anti-GBM antibody but positive for the myeloperoxidase (MPO) anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (p-ANCA) and another atypical ANCA. Laboratory test results showed severe renal insufficiency with a creatinine level of 385 μmol/L. Renal biopsy specimen analysis revealed 100% glomeruli with crescents; immunofluorescence showed immunoglobulin G (IgG) linearly deposited alongside the GBM. Finally, the patient was discharged successfully after treatment with plasmapheresis, methylprednisolone and prednisone.

Conclusion

This patient, whose serum was negative for the anti-GBM antibody but positive for p-ANCA and another atypical ANCA, had a rare case of anti-GBM disease. Insights from this unusual case might help physicians diagnose rare forms of glomerulonephritis and treat affected patients in a timely manner.

### Bench-to-bedside review: pulmonary-renal syndromes – an update for the intensivist [^116h6atc]. Critical Care (2007). Low credibility.

The term Pulmonary-renal syndrome refers to the combination of diffuse alveolar haemorrhage and rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis. A variety of mechanisms such as those involving antiglomerular basement membrane antibodies, antineutrophil cytoplasm antibodies or immunocomplexes and thrombotic microangiopathy are implicated in the pathogenesis of this syndrome. The underlying pulmonary pathology is small-vessel vasculitis involving arterioles, venules and, frequently, alveolar capillaries. The underlying renal pathology is a form of focal proliferative glomerulonephritis. Immunofluorescence helps to distinguish between antiglomerular basement membrane disease (linear deposition of IgG), lupus and postinfectious glomerulonephritis (granular deposition of immunoglobulin and complement) and necrotizing vasculitis (pauci-immune glomerulonephritis). Patients may present with severe respiratory and/or renal failure and require admission to the intensive care unit. Since the syndrome is characterized by a fulminant course if left untreated, early diagnosis, exclusion of infection, close monitoring of the patient and timely initiation of treatment are crucial for the patient's outcome. Treatment consists of corticosteroids in high doses, and cytotoxic agents coupled with plasma exchange in certain cases. Renal transplantation is the only alternative in end-stage renal disease. Newer immunomodulatory agents such as those causing TNF blockade, B-cell depletion and mycophenolate mofetil could be used in patients with refractory disease.

### A case report of atypical anti-glomerular basement membrane disease [^111FdCTM]. BMC Nephrology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Anti-glomerular basement membrane (anti-GBM) disease is characterized by crescentic necrotizing glomerulonephritis, with linear deposits of immunoglobulin G (IgG) in the GBM. Classic anti-GBM disease is clinically associated with rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis with or without pulmonary hemorrhage. Some patients have a better renal prognosis and milder symptoms than those with classic anti-GBM disease, which is termed atypical anti-GBM disease.

Case Presentation

A 43-year-old Japanese woman was admitted to our hospital complaining of hematuria that had persisted for more than one month. Serological examination revealed negativity for anti-nuclear, anti-neutrophilic cytoplasmic, and anti-GBM antibodies. However, renal biopsy showed cellular crescents. Immunofluorescence revealed strong diffuse linear capillary loop staining for IgG. An indirect immunofluorescence antibody method was performed by applying the patient serum to normal kidney tissue to confirm the presence of autoantibodies binding to the GBM. Using this method, anti-GBM antibodies were detected. The patient was treated with high-dose steroids, cyclophosphamide, and plasma exchange. Aggressive treatment resolved proteinuria and hematuria and improved renal function.

Conclusions

Renal biopsy is crucial in the diagnosis of anti-GBM disease, especially when serological tests are negative. Accurately identifying the presence of anti-GBM disease is important to initiate optimal treatment.

### Anti-glomerular basement membrane antibody disease: a rare autoimmune disorder affecting the kidney and the lung [^115Y7dWu]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Anti-glomerular basement membrane antibody disease is a rare, but well characterized cause of glomerulonephritis. By definition serum anti-GBM antibody and/or a linear binding of IgG detected by direct immunofluorescence (IF) in a histological specimen of the kidney or the lung have to be detected. These antibodies can lead to acute rapid progressive glomerulonephritis(RPGN) and/or pulmonary hemorrhage (PH) because of collagen similarities in the basement membrane. Principally anti-GBM antibody disease can be divided into two groups: anti-GBM antibody disease without PH was regarded as renal-limited anti-GBM antibody disease and that with PH was defined as Goodpasture's syndrome (GPS). The important determinant for the response of therapy and long term diagnosis on anti-GBM disease is early diagnosis to prevent endstage renal disease. Therefore, standard treatment is a combined therapy of plasmapherisis, prednisolone and cyclophosphamide. The aim of this review is an overview of the pathogenesis, clinical presentation, diagnosis and treatment of anti-GBM disease.

### Use of rituximab as an induction therapy in anti-glomerular basement-membrane disease [^114pd1qa]. BMC Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Anti-glomerular basement-membrane (anti-GBM) disease is an autoimmune disorder that is characterized by pulmonary hemorrhage and rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis, which usually manifests as acute renal failure. It is termed Goodpasture disease when both manifestations are simultaneously exhibited. This rare disease occurs in 1 person per million /year and generally evolves as a single acute phase, it relapses rarely. Anti-GBM disease is caused by antibodies against non-collagenous domain-1 of the alpha-3 and alpha-5 chain in type IV collagen. The diagnosis is made by detecting circulating anti-GBM antibodies and a kidney biopsy provides a definitive diagnosis when there is renal involvement. Using light microscopy, focal proliferative or necrotizing crescentic glomerulonephritis is observed. The pathognomonic finding is linear deposition of immunoglobulin G (IgG) along the glomerular basement membrane seen by direct immunofluorescence.

Before the advent of plasmapheresis therapy, the mortality rate was ~ 90%. Today, patient survival at 1 year is 100% when creatinine level is < 5.6 mg/dL at presentation. Reliable predictors for an adverse outcome include a serum-creatinine level of > 6.8 mg/dL, dialysis-dependence, and a percentage of crescentic glomeruli of > 50% at diagnosis. The 2012 guidelines for Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes recommend initiating immunosuppression with cyclophosphamide plus corticosteroids and plasma exchange in all patients with anti-GBM glomerulonephritis, except for those that are dialysis-dependent at presentation and have 100% crescents on a biopsy and do not have a pulmonary hemorrhage. However, this approach results in a significant proportion of patients remaining dialysis-dependent plus causing significant side-effects.

Anti-GBM antibodies can be pathogenic and their removal is associated with renal recovery. The inhibition of their production through B-cell depletion could be of value. In renal vasculitis, e.g. ANCA-associated vasculitis, the use of the anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, rituximab, has been reported to be efficacious in large randomized controlled studies. Herein, we report on the largest series of patients with Goodpasture syndrome, where the first-line immunosuppressive therapy was based on rituximab.

### Double trouble | NEJM resident 360… [^114XKb9f]. resident360.nejm.org (2019). Medium credibility.

Literature Clinical Pearls & Morning Reports Published November 6, 2019 Linear autoantibody deposition along glomerular basement membranes is pathognomonic for antiglomerular basement membrane disease. A negative or pauci-immune pattern is associated with the antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody –associated vasculitis syndromes of granulomatosis with polyangiitis, microscopic polyangiitis, and eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis. Read the Clinical Problem-Solving Article here. Clinical Pearls Q: In what ways are anti-GBM disease and ANCA-associated vasculitis similar. A: Complement factor levels are often normal in ANCA-associated vasculitis or anti-GBM disease, both of which have pulmonary and renal manifestations. Both ANCA-associated vasculitis and anti-GBM disease cause rapidly progressive crescentic glomerulonephritis.

A: Malaise, arthralgia, and extended illness are more characteristic of an ANCA-associated vasculitis than of anti-GBM disease, which usually does not cause constitutional symptoms. The pathogenic anti-GBM antibodies affect the alveolar basement membranes and lead to diffuse alveolar hemorrhage; these antibodies would not be expected to cause a focal pneumonitis or pleuritis. A: This disease is caused by autoantibody-mediated injury to the glomerular and alveolar basement membranes. The autoantibody is expressed against the noncollagenous domain 1 of the alpha-3 chain of type IV collagen specific to specialized basement membranes of glomeruli and alveoli. Pulmonary involvement is seen in 30 to 60% of patients at presentation, is more common among smokers than nonsmokers, and is manifested by cough, hemoptysis, dyspnea, and hypoxemia, with extensive alveolar infiltrates on chest imaging.

A: Rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis with coexistent ANCAs and anti-GBM antibodies is referred to as double antibody–positive disease. Up to one third of patients with anti-GBM antibodies also have ANCAs. Approximately 5% of patients who are initially positive for ANCAs are found to have anti-GBM antibodies.

### Recurrence of goodpasture syndrome without circulating anti-glomerular basement membrane antibodies after kidney transplant, a case report [^1161L36n]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Goodpasture Syndrome (GS) is an autoimmune disease mediated by anti-Glomerular Basement Membrane (GBM) antibodies the first description of which was attributed to Ernest Goodpasture. The linear immunofluorescence staining for immunoglobulin G (IgG) on the GBM in kidney biopsy specimens is a pathognomonic finding of GS. This syndrome is characterized by the presence of Rapidly Progressive GlomeruloNephritis (RPGN) that leads to acute renal failure, and of potentially life-threatening pulmonary hemorrhages. GS is commonly described as a monophasic illness. Although, its incidence has been recently estimated at 1.6 case per million per year, it accounts for approximately 20% of all RPGN cases. The titer of circulating antibodies against collagen type IV, alpha-3 is considered a measure of disease severity and correlates with the renal outcomes. It may also be a predictive factor of relapse. Moreover, Anti-Neutrophil Cytoplasmic Antibodies (ANCA) with affinity for myeloperoxidase are detected in 25% of patients with GS. Circulating antibodies are undetectable in about 5% of patients with GS.

Here, we describe and discuss the case of a woman with a GS relapse without detectable circulating anti-GBM antibodies that led to acute renal allograft dysfunction one year after transplantation. The graft was performed 4 years after the first diagnosis of GS without circulating anti-GBM antibodies (in 2011), when the patient was considered in remission.

### Crescentic glomerulonephritis with Anti-GBM antibody but no glomerular deposition [^115ZmSTw]. BMC Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Anti-glomerular basement membrane (GBM) antibodies are highly specific for Goodpasture's or anti-GBM disease, in which they are generally directed against the non-collagenous (NC1) domain of the alpha 3 chain of type IV collagen(α3(IV)), and less commonly, toward the α 4(IV) or α 5(IV) chains, which form a triple helical structure in GBM and alveolar basement membrane (ABM). Alterations in the hexameric structure of the NC1 (α3 (IV)), allows novel epitopes to be exposed and an immune response to develop, with subsequent linear antibody deposition along the GBM, leading to a crescentic glomerulonephritis. Positive anti-GBM antibodies are assumed to be pathogenic and capable of binding GBM in vivo, especially in the context of rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis.

We have investigated patients with circulating anti-GBM antibodies, reactive to α3 (IV) and human GBM by immunoassays and Western blotting respectively, with focal necrotising crescentic glomerulonephritis but no linear GBM antibody deposition on immunohistochemistry. Three out of four were also ANCA positive. Despite not binding native GBM, patients' sera showed linear binding to primate glomeruli by indirect immunofluorescence, in the 2 cases tested. Following treatment, significant improvements in kidney function were found in 3/4 patients.

Case presentation

We present four patients with crescentic glomerulonephritis and circulating anti-GBM antibodies, but no glomerular binding.

Conclusions

These novel findings, demonstrate that in some patients anti-GBM antibodies may not bind their own GBM. This has important implications for clinical diagnosis, suggesting that histological confirmation of kidney injury by anti-GBM antibodies should be obtained, as non-binding GBM antibodies may be associated with significant renal recovery.

### Immunoglobulin A nephropathy… [^115h6iDY]. publications.aap.org (2025). Medium credibility.

Immunoglobulin A nephropathy is the most common form of primary chronic glomerular disease worldwide. First described in 1968 by pathologist Jean Berger, it was regarded for many years as a benign condition. However, the widespread use of kidney biopsy has provided better insight into its full consequences, demonstrating it to be an important chronic, slowly progressive cause of end-stage renal disease in the pediatric population, leading eventually to renal failure in many patients. An immune complex–mediated nephropathy, IgAN is defined immunohistologically by the presence of glomerular IgA deposition accompanied by a mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis. IgAN is most common in white and Asian populations, with a peak incidence in the second and third decades of life. The annual incidence in the United States is reported to be 0. 5 pediatric cases per 100,
000. In Japan, remarkably, the incidence is 10 times as high, but worldwide the highest incidence of IgAN is.

### Recurrence of goodpasture syndrome without circulating anti-glomerular basement membrane antibodies after kidney transplant, a case report [^1158miJo]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Goodpasture Syndrome (GS) is an autoimmune disease caused by the development of auto-antibodies against the Glomerular Basement Membrane (GBM). Linear deposit of immunoglobulins G on the GBM detected by immunofluorescence analysis of renal biopsies is a GS pathognomonic finding. GS is commonly monophasic and its incidence is 1.6 case per million per year.

Case presentation

This report describes and discusses the case of a 40-year-old woman who one year after allograft kidney transplant, presented with acute pulmonary and renal symptoms of GS, leading to acute graft dysfunction, without circulating anti-GBM antibody detection in laboratory assays. She received a living donor kidney transplant 4 years after the first diagnosis of GS without circulating anti-GBM antibodies, when considered in remission.

Conclusions

In both episodes, the diagnosis of GS was based exclusively on the kidney biopsy that showed rapidly progressing glomerulonephritis with deposition of immunoglobulins G on the GBM. Although rare, the management of patients with GS without circulating anti-GBM antibodies is difficult due to the lack of standardized follow-up guidelines to reduce the risk of GS recurrence after kidney transplantation.

Anti–glomerular basement membrane (GBM) disease — course and follow-up: Anti-GBM disease appears to be monophasic and self-limited, with antibodies often disappearing spontaneously after 6–18 months; however, relapses have rarely been reported, which makes ongoing patient and laboratory monitoring important for at least the first 2 years and lengthened thereafter. There is a small percentage of patients who have persistence of low levels of anti-GBM antibodies, and in such patients, consideration could be made for using azathioprine after cyclophosphamide.

### Goodpasture's disease in the absence of circulating anti-glomerular basement membrane antibodies as detected by standard techniques [^1145LWHe]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

Goodpasture's disease is characterized by rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis, often accompanied by pulmonary hemorrhage, in association with deposition of antibodies in a linear pattern on the glomerular basement membrane (GBM). The diagnosis of Goodpasture's disease in patients with acute renal failure often relies on the use of immunoassays to detect circulating anti-GBM antibodies in serum samples. We describe three cases of Goodpasture's disease in which no circulating anti-GBM antibodies were detectable in serum by well-established enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay or Western blotting techniques. The diagnosis of Goodpasture's disease was confirmed by renal biopsy, with linear deposition of immunoglobulin along the GBM and crescentic glomerulonephritis. In addition, an alternative method of antibody detection using a highly sensitive biosensor system confirmed that circulating antibodies were present in sera from both patients tested. Because this technique is not routinely available for the detection of anti-GBM antibodies, we suggest that diagnosis always be confirmed with a renal biopsy, and despite negative serological test results using immunoassay, the diagnosis of Goodpasture's disease should still be considered in the correct clinical context.

### KDIGO 2021 clinical practice guideline for the management of glomerular diseases [^117MyNVm]. Kidney International (2021). Medium credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on anti-glomerular basement membrane disease:

- **Definition**: Anti-GBM disease, previously called Goodpasture's disease, is a systemic autoimmune disorder resulting in progressive crescentic glomerulonephritis and, frequently, diffuse pulmonary alveolar hemorrhage.
- **Pathophysiology**: Anti-GBM disease is caused by an autoimmune response against type IV collagen molecules in the kidneys and lungs triggered by environmental factors in genetically predisposed individuals.
- **Disease course**: Autoantibodies against type IV collagen molecules in the kidneys and lungs result in anti-GBM disease, which causes clinical manifestations of RPGN with concurrent lung hemorrhage. Disease progression may lead to dialysis-dependent kidney failure, ESRD necessitating kidney transplantation, and respiratory failure.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Anti-GBM disease is associated with an in-hospital mortality rate of 7.7 per 100 admissions.
