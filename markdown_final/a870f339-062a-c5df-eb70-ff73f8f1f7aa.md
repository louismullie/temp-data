## Question

What are the clinical manifestations of carcinomatosis leptomeningea?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the clinical manifestations of carcinomatosis leptomeningea, also known as leptomeningeal metastasis or leptomeningeal carcinomatosis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiology that explains why symptoms are multifocal and diffuse. Then, I should categorize manifestations by neuroanatomic compartment: cerebral, cranial nerve, spinal, and autonomic. Next, I will quantify how often certain symptoms occur and note red flags that should trigger suspicion. After that, I should consider tumor-specific patterns and atypical presentations. Finally, I will integrate this into a practical clinical approach and explicitly state the diagnostic implications of multifocality and progression, anchoring to high-quality guidelines and contemporary reviews.

> Let me first confirm the pathophysiologic basis, because the clinical picture is a direct consequence of tumor cells seeding the leptomeninges and circulating with CSF flow, producing multifocal, noncontiguous involvement of brain, cranial nerves, and spinal roots. This explains why patients often have several simultaneous deficits across compartments, and why symptoms can evolve quickly as new areas are seeded [^e348d40d] [^697e9615].

> I will now examine cerebral and ventricular manifestations, which commonly reflect increased intracranial pressure and diffuse cortical irritation. Headache is frequent and often positional, accompanied by nausea and vomiting; cognitive changes, confusion, and encephalopathy are common; seizures occur in roughly a fifth of patients; and papilledema may be present when ICP is elevated, with plateau waves causing abrupt symptom flares. Obstructive or communicating hydrocephalus can develop from impaired CSF resorption, worsening these features [^6934c94d] [^697e9615] [^f69c4768].

> Next, I should review cranial nerve involvement, because multiple cranial neuropathies are a hallmark that should raise immediate suspicion in a cancer patient. Diplopia from abducens palsy, facial weakness, visual disturbances including loss or field defects, and hearing loss are repeatedly emphasized; importantly, about half of patients with cranial nerve involvement have more than one cranial neuropathy, which is a red flag for leptomeningeal disease rather than a focal process [^6934c94d] [^f3eab027].

> Hold on, let me verify spinal and radicular manifestations, since these often drive functional decline. Patients develop radicular pain, limb weakness, sensory loss, and gait instability; cauda equina involvement produces leg weakness, saddle anesthesia, and bowel or bladder dysfunction, and in NSCLC cohorts, cauda equina syndrome correlates strongly with typical spinal MRI findings, underscoring the value of imaging the entire neuraxis when suspected [^6934c94d] [^aaec3e6f].

> I need to ensure I capture autonomic and systemic features that can be overlooked. Dysautonomia with urinary retention or incontinence, and positional symptoms such as orthostatic worsening of headache, are described; in some series, intracranial hypertension presentations predominate early, while in others radicular or cranial nerve signs dominate, reflecting heterogeneity in disease distribution and patient factors [^6934c94d] [^ef18bad9].

> Let me consider frequency patterns to anchor pretest probability. In a large retrospective series, intracranial hypertension features were most common, followed by cerebellar symptoms, radiculopathy, cranial nerve palsies, and seizures; in gastroesophageal cohorts, sensory or motor deficits, headache, and visual loss were the leading symptoms at CNS presentation, reinforcing that deficits are multifocal and often concurrent rather than isolated [^ef18bad9] [^caffa9e1].

> But wait, what if the presentation is atypical or the tumor is uncommon for leptomeningeal spread. I should double-check that LMC can be the first manifestation of cancer, and that unusual sites like gastric or colorectal primaries can present with LMC, sometimes with diffuse-type histology and early CNS involvement; case reports and series document catatonia, isolated visual loss, or even incidental MRI findings, so a high index of suspicion is warranted when neurological symptoms are multifocal or progressive in any cancer patient [^a5a29aad] [^0c29761c] [^e4e1115a] [^336e3553].

> Next, I should review the diagnostic implications, because recognizing this pattern changes management. Multifocal, noncontiguous neurological deficits in a patient with cancer should prompt urgent brain and spine MRI with gadolinium and CSF analysis, ideally after MRI to avoid post–lumbar puncture artifacts; cytology sensitivity is modest on a single tap but rises with serial sampling, and modern CSF circulating tumor cell or cell-free DNA assays can increase sensitivity and yield molecular insights for targeted therapy [^7c761f36] [^60d28bac] [^3f424627].

> Hold on, I should verify prognostic context to frame counseling. Historical median survival is often cited as 2–4 months, but this is an oversimplification; contemporary series show heterogeneity by tumor type, molecular subtype, and treatment, with some patients, particularly with breast cancer or actionable mutations, achieving substantially longer survival under multidisciplinary care, so prognostic discussions should be individualized rather than relying on a single historical figure [^d81363af] [^e364f71c] [^50d1cee7].

> In summary, I need to ensure the clinical message is precise: leptomeningeal carcinomatosis typically presents with multifocal neurological dysfunction spanning cerebral, cranial nerve, spinal, and autonomic domains, with common features including headache with nausea and vomiting, cognitive changes, seizures, multiple cranial neuropathies, radicular pain with weakness or sensory loss, gait instability, and bowel or bladder dysfunction. Recognizing this pattern in a cancer patient should trigger expedited neuraxial imaging and CSF evaluation, because early diagnosis enables timely multimodal therapy and can meaningfully alter outcomes in selected subgroups [^6934c94d] [^697e9615] [^7c761f36].

Carcinomatosis leptomeningea (leptomeningeal metastasis) presents with **multifocal neurological symptoms** due to diffuse leptomeningeal infiltration and CSF dissemination [^697e9615]. The most common manifestations are **headache, nausea/vomiting, and cranial nerve palsies** (especially diplopia, facial weakness, hearing loss, and visual disturbances) [^f3eab027] [^6934c94d]. Patients also develop **radicular pain**, limb weakness, sensory loss, gait instability, and bowel/bladder dysfunction from spinal root involvement [^6934c94d]. Cognitive decline, seizures, and encephalopathy occur with cortical or diencephalic involvement, and increased intracranial pressure from hydrocephalus can cause papilledema and altered consciousness [^6934c94d] [^697e9615]. Symptoms are typically progressive and multifocal, often appearing in combination, and may precede or accompany parenchymal brain metastases [^697e9615] [^68c8fd9f].

## Clinical manifestations by neuroanatomical involvement

### Cerebral and ventricular system involvement

- **Headache**: Often positional, worsened by coughing or bending, reflecting increased intracranial pressure (ICP) from impaired CSF flow or hydrocephalus [^6934c94d].

- **Nausea and vomiting**: Commonly associated with headache due to elevated ICP [^6934c94d].

- **Cognitive impairment and encephalopathy**: Memory loss, confusion, and behavioral changes from cortical infiltration and meningeal inflammation [^6934c94d].

- **Seizures**: Focal or generalized, occurring in approximately 22% of patients [^6934c94d].

- **Papilledema**: From sustained elevated ICP and hydrocephalus [^6934c94d].

---

### Cranial nerve involvement

Cranial nerve involvement is common and often multifocal; **cranial nerve palsies** include:

| **Cranial nerve** | **Clinical manifestation** |
|-|-|
| II | Visual loss, field defects |
| III, IV, VI | Diplopia, ophthalmoplegia |
| V | Facial numbness, dysesthesia |
| VII | Facial weakness, dysarthria |
| VIII | Hearing loss, tinnitus, vertigo |
| IX, X | Dysphagia, aspiration risk |

---

Multiple cranial neuropathies co-occur in about **50% of patients** and are a key diagnostic clue [^6934c94d].

---

### Spinal and radicular involvement

- **Radicular pain**: Severe, often bilateral, following dermatomal patterns from nerve root infiltration [^6934c94d].

- **Motor weakness**: Limb weakness, paraparesis, or quadriparesis from root compression and ischemia [^6934c94d].

- **Sensory loss**: Paresthesia, numbness, and sensory level deficits [^6934c94d].

- **Gait instability**: Ataxia and difficulty walking from cerebellar or spinal involvement [^6934c94d].

- **Bowel and bladder dysfunction**: Urinary retention, incontinence, and constipation from cauda equina involvement [^6934c94d].

---

### Autonomic and systemic symptoms

Autonomic and systemic symptoms include **dysautonomia** — orthostatic hypotension, gastrointestinal motility disturbances, and sexual dysfunction — and **systemic symptoms** such as fatigue, weight loss, and malaise from advanced malignancy [^6934c94d].

---

## Frequency and pattern of symptoms

Symptoms are typically **multifocal and progressive**, often appearing in combination; in a large retrospective series, the most frequent presentations were intracranial hypertension (headache, nausea, vomiting), cerebellar symptoms (ataxia, dysarthria), radiculopathy, cranial nerve palsies, and seizures [^ef18bad9]. Cognitive impairment and encephalopathy are reported in up to 93% of patients, underscoring the diffuse nature of leptomeningeal disease [^6934c94d].

---

## Prognostic implications of clinical manifestations

Certain manifestations carry prognostic significance: **encephalopathy and altered mental status** indicate extensive disease and correlate with poor outcomes, whereas **isolated cranial nerve palsies without encephalopathy** may respond better to therapy and are associated with relatively better survival [^e54ea706]. Early recognition and treatment can modestly extend survival and improve quality of life, though median survival remains approximately 2–4 months without targeted therapy [^d81363af].

---

## Summary of key clinical manifestations

- **Headache, nausea, vomiting**: From increased intracranial pressure and hydrocephalus [^6934c94d].

- **Cranial nerve palsies**: Diplopia, facial weakness, hearing loss, visual disturbances [^f3eab027].

- **Radicular pain, limb weakness, sensory loss**: From spinal root involvement [^6934c94d].

- **Cognitive impairment, seizures, encephalopathy**: From cortical and subcortical infiltration [^6934c94d].

- **Gait instability, ataxia**: From cerebellar or spinal involvement [^6934c94d].

- **Bowel and bladder dysfunction**: From cauda equina involvement [^6934c94d].

---

Carcinomatosis leptomeningea presents with **multifocal neurological symptoms** — headache, cranial nerve palsies, radicular pain, limb weakness, sensory loss, cognitive impairment, seizures, and autonomic dysfunction — reflecting diffuse leptomeningeal infiltration and CSF dissemination. Recognition of this pattern is essential for early diagnosis and management.

### Leptomeningeal metastatic disease: new frontiers and future directions [^6792c112]. Nature Reviews: Clinical Oncology (2025). High credibility.

Leptomeningeal metastatic disease (LMD), encompassing entities of 'meningeal carcinomatosis', neoplastic meningitis' and 'leukaemic/lymphomatous meningitis', arises secondary to the metastatic dissemination of cancer cells from extracranial and certain intracranial malignancies into the leptomeninges and cerebrospinal fluid. The clinical burden of LMD has been increasing secondary to more sensitive diagnostics, aggressive local therapies for discrete brain metastases, and improved management of extracranial disease with targeted and immunotherapeutic agents, resulting in improved survival. However, owing to drug delivery challenges and the unique microenvironment of LMD, novel therapies against systemic disease have not yet translated into improved outcomes for these patients. Underdiagnosis and misdiagnosis are common, response assessment remains challenging, and the prognosis associated with this disease of whole neuroaxis remains extremely poor. The dearth of effective therapies is further challenged by the difficulties in studying this dynamic disease state. In this Review, a multidisciplinary group of experts describe the emerging evidence and areas of active investigation in LMD and provide directed recommendations for future research. Drawing upon paradigm-changing advances in mechanistic science, computational approaches, and trial design, the authors discuss domain-specific and cross-disciplinary strategies for optimizing the clinical and translational research landscape for LMD. Advances in diagnostics, multi-agent intrathecal therapies, cell-based therapies, immunotherapies, proton craniospinal irradiation and ongoing clinical trials offer hope for improving outcomes for patients with LMD.

Purpose Of Review

Leptomeningeal disease (LMD) is a devastating complication of advanced metastatic cancer associated with a poor prognosis and limited treatment options. This study reviews the current understanding of the clinical presentation, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment of LMD. We highlight opportunities for advances in this disease.

Recent Findings

In recent years, the use of soluble CSF biomarkers has expanded, suggesting improved sensitivity over traditional cytology, identification of targetable mutations, and potential utility for monitoring disease burden. Recent studies of targeted small molecules and intrathecal based therapies have demonstrated an increase in overall and progression-free survival. In addition, there are several ongoing trials evaluating immunotherapy in LMD. Though overall prognosis of LMD remains poor, studies suggest a potential role for soluble CSF biomarkers in diagnosis and management and demonstrate promising findings in patient outcomes with targeted therapies for specific solid tumors. Despite these advances, there continues to be a gap of knowledge in this disease, emphasizing the importance of inclusion of LMD patients in clinical trials.

### Leptomeningeal metastasis from non-small cell lung cancer and current landscape of treatments [^12a11a8e]. Clinical Cancer Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Leptomeningeal metastasis (LM), also known as leptomeningeal carcinomatosis (LC), is a devastating complication of metastatic cancer that occurs when neoplastic cells invade the meningeal space. Diagnosis of LM remains challenging given the heterogeneous signs and symptoms at presentation and requires thorough neurological examination, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis, and MRI of the brain and spine with gadolinium. Detecting neoplastic cells in the CSF is the gold standard for diagnosing leptomeningeal metastases; however, it has low sensitivity and may require multiple CSF samples. New emerging technologies, such as liquid biopsy of CSF, have increased sensitivity and specificity for detecting circulating tumor cells in CSF. The management of LM in patients with NSCLC requires an individualized multidisciplinary approach. Treatment options include surgery for ventricular shunt placement, radiation therapy to bulky or symptomatic disease sites, systemic or intrathecal chemotherapy, molecularly targeted agents, and, more recently, immunotherapy. Targeting actionable mutations in LM from NSCLC, such as EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors or anaplastic lymphoma kinase gene rearrangement inhibitors, has shown encouraging results in terms of disease control and survival. Although there are limited data regarding the use of immunotherapy in LM, immunotherapy has produced promising results in several case reports. In this review, we focused on the epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and current treatment strategies, with a special emphasis on novel agents, including targeted therapies and immunotherapy of LM in patients with NSCLC.

### Diagnostic and therapeutic updates in leptomeningeal disease [^68c8fd9f]. Current Oncology Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Leptomeningeal disease (LMD) refers to the spread of malignant cells to the leptomeninges, subarachnoid space, and other cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) compartments. The majority of LMD arises from solid tumors originating outside the central nervous system (CNS), although primary CNS tumors can also infiltrate the leptomeningeal space. The rate of known LMD in cancer patients is approximately 5%, with case series suggesting an incidence of asymptomatic or undiagnosed LMD in up to 20% of solid-tumor patients at the time of autopsy.

The incidence of LMD varies by primary cancer type and is most commonly found in breast, lung, and melanoma patients. The majority of patients with LMD have coexisting parenchymal brain metastases (BrM), but up to 42% of LMD is diagnosed in the absence of parenchymal involvement. LMD has been associated with advanced malignancy and very poor prognosis, with median survival in historical cohorts ranging from 1 month without therapy to 3–6 months with radiation and chemotherapy. However, the era of targeted therapy has fundamentally changed the diagnostic and therapeutic landscape for BrM and LMD patients; some novel therapies have extended median survival in certain types of LMD beyond 1 year.

In this review, we discuss the clinical presentation, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and management of LMD arising from systemic solid tumors, lymphoma/leukemias, and primary brain tumors. We highlight recent advances and discuss opportunities for progress in the coming years.

Therapeutic Advances in Leptomeningeal Disease

Current clinical practice is dominated by the poor outcome of LM. The primary goals are therefore symptomatic management by surgical and/or radiation-based therapies followed by intrathecal and/or systemic chemotherapy (Table 2). Due to the lack of large randomized controlled clinical trials, evidence-based treatment recommendations in LM are limited. In absence of prospectively validated criteria, assessment of treatment response can also be challenging. To address this issue, a Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) workgroup proposed criteria for LM response to treatment which combines neurologic examination, CSF analysis, and MRI findings. The original RANO proposal for response criteria provided a scorecard for radiographic assessment of LM with points assigned for presence of subarachnoid or ventricular nodules, leptomeningeal enhancement, and cranial nerve enhancement to characterize brain and spine involvement while noting parenchymal and epidural involvement. Due to discordant scoring noted upon review of MRIs from 22 patients with LM, a simplified scorecard noting the presence or absence of subarachnoid/ventricular nodules and leptomeningeal linear enhancement in the brain and the spine was proposed, but needs further validation. European Association of Neuro-Oncology (EANO) and European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) have jointly issued practice guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of LM.EANO-ESMO guidelines provide a treatment algorithm based on patient's prognosis, presence of concurrent brain metastases, and state of extracranial disease.

Overview of Commonly Employed Treatments for Leptomeningeal Disease

Surgical Therapy

Surgical resection of metastatic lesions is not within the standard treatment protocol of LM. Neurosurgical intervention can be needed, however through the management of obstructive hydrocephalus and increased intracranial pressure. Treating hydrocephalus from LM can include high volume lumbar puncture for symptomatic relief and placement of ventriculoperitoneal shunt (VPS) systems if needed for longer-term relief. Despite short overall survival, VPS placement is an effective palliative measure, with peritoneal carcinomatosis an extremely rare complication.

Treatment of Leptomeningeal Disease

Given the challenges of LMD diagnosis, it is not surprising that there are few prospective, randomized, controlled trials evaluating the treatment of LMD. Therefore, clinicians and patients approach treatment decisions with limited data, balancing side effects with potential benefits to symptom burden and survival. Surgery and radiation have primarily palliative roles that can improve quality of life in select patients. The use of systemic therapy has historically been hampered by limited CNS penetration and activity. However, with the emergence of novel, molecular targeting agents and immunotherapy, there has been an expansion of pharmacologic options associated with improved survival outcomes. These agents can be administered as monotherapy, in combination with one another, or in combination with radiation therapy and/or surgical intervention. Treatment decisions should be based on a thoughtful balance of underlying tumor histology, presence of molecular targets, clinical performance status, and patient preference given that current treatments for solid tumor LMD are not curative.

Introduction

Leptomeningeal carcinomatosis (LMC) is a rare and potentially lethal complication of cancer that occurs when cancer cells spread to the membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord, known as the leptomeninges. The cancer cells can spread to the leptomeninges through the bloodstream or via direct extension from a nearby tumour. They are resistant to most chemotherapy options due to this being a 'sanctuary' site where they are protected by the limited filtration across the blood brain barrier.

LMC can cause a range of neurological symptoms, such as headache, nausea, vomiting, seizures, altered sensorium, memory loss and difficulty speaking or walking. The non-specificity of these symptoms could initially be mistaken for other conditions, making LMC challenging to diagnose. If left untreated, LMC can lead to severe and potentially life-threatening complications. Diagnosis of LMC is typically made using cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis and imaging modalities.

### Leptomeningeal metastasis from solid tumors [^7ec7b569]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2020). Medium credibility.

Central nervous system (CNS) metastasis from systemic cancers can involve the brain parenchyma, leptomeninges (pia, subarachnoid space and arachnoid mater), and dura. Leptomeningeal metastases (LM), also known by different terms including neoplastic meningitis and carcinomatous meningitis, occur in both solid tumors and hematologic malignancies. This review will focus exclusively on LM arising from solid tumors with a goal of providing the reader an understanding of the epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical presentation, prognostication, current management and future directions.

### Novel approaches to treating leptomeningeal metastases [^0dd8d9cc]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2012). Low credibility.

Leptomeningeal metastasis is a devastating complication of the central nervous system in patients with late-stage solid or hematological cancers. Leptomeningeal metastasis results from the multifocal seeding of the leptomeninges by malignant cancer cells. Although central nervous system metastasis usually presents in patients with widely disseminated and progressive late-stage cancer, malignant cells may spread to the cerebrospinal fluid during earlier disease stages in particularly aggressive cancers. Treatment of leptomeningeal metastasis is largely palliative but will often provide stabilization and protection from further neurological deterioration and improve quality of life. There is a need to raise awareness of the impact of leptomeningeal metastases on cancer patients and its known and putative biological basis. Novel diagnostic approaches include identification of biomarkers that may stratify the risk for developing leptomeningeal metastasis. Current therapies can be used more effectively while waiting for advanced treatments to be developed.

### Leptomeningeal metastases from solid tumors: a Society for Neuro-oncology and American Society of Clinical Oncology consensus review on clinical management and future directions [^51d845d3]. Neuro-Oncology (2024). Medium credibility.

Leptomeningeal metastases (LM), long regarded as an advanced complication of solid malignancies, have strategically evaded durable treatment options for decades. The ambiguous processes which facilitate cancer cell dissemination to the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and survival in such hypoxic, nutrient-sparse conditions have led to challenges in curbing the growth of metastases within the leptomeninges relative to other intracranial and extracranial sites. Faced with widespread therapeutic nihilism and limited expert consensus on optimal diagnostic and management strategies, this disease state has historically led to significant neurologic morbidity and rapid mortality for those afflicted. However, as modern oncologic care has prolonged the lives of patients with cancer and improved early diagnosis of central nervous system (CNS) progression, this previously described "rare" stage of malignancy is now being observed in as many as 1 in 5 patients with certain high-risk cancer molecular subtypes. Paralleling this rise in LM diagnosis is a greater scientific understanding of cancer cell biology in the leptomeningeal space and the development of innovative treatment options that challenge the historical survival benchmark of 2–4 months in patients with leptomeningeal tumor dissemination.

To effectively meet the demands of rapidly expanding therapeutic options and diagnostic algorithms in this space, the Society for Neuro-Oncology (SNO) and American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) have facilitated a platform for international expert discussion and consensus on the topics of LM biology, epidemiology, diagnosis, management, clinical research, and future directions (Table 1). The aim of this consensus statement is to consolidate the modern state of LM innovation into cohesive recommendations for best clinical and research practices, with attention to critical unresolved questions and topics worthy of focused collaborative investigation.

Abstract

Leptomeningeal metastases (LM) are increasingly becoming recognized as a treatable, yet generally incurable, complication of advanced cancer. As modern cancer therapeutics have prolonged the lives of patients with metastatic cancer, specifically in patients with parenchymal brain metastases, treatment options, and clinical research protocols for patients with LM from solid tumors have similarly evolved to improve survival within specific populations. Recent expansions in clinical investigation, early diagnosis, and drug development have given rise to new unanswered questions. These include leptomeningeal metastasis biology and preferred animal modeling, epidemiology in the modern cancer population, ensuring validation and accessibility of newer leptomeningeal metastasis diagnostics, best clinical practices with multimodality treatment options, clinical trial design and standardization of response assessments, and avenues worthy of further research. An international group of multi-disciplinary experts in the research and management of LM, supported by the Society for Neuro-Oncology and American Society of Clinical Oncology, were assembled to reach a consensus opinion on these pressing topics and provide a roadmap for future directions. Our hope is that these recommendations will accelerate collaboration and progress in the field of LM and serve as a platform for further discussion and patient advocacy.

### Leptomeningeal carcinomatosis and brain metastases in gastroesophageal carcinoma: a real-world analysis of clinical and pathologic characteristics and outcomes [^4193a101]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2024). Medium credibility.

In previous studies involving individuals with brain metastasis have not demonstrated a significant discrepancy in the time to develop brain metastasis between those with HER2-positive and HER2-negative statuses. However, in our research, patients with HER2-positive disease showed a delayed time to develop brain metastasis, with a median of 12 months (95% CI, 9.7–19.1 months), as opposed to 6.7 months (95% CI, 3.4–13.8) for their HER2-negative counterparts. Most of patients with HER2-positive disease received anti-HER2 treatment which might have contributed for this outcome. Conversely, individuals with leptomeningeal carcinomatosis displayed a faster onset of CNS metastasis, with a median time to leptomeningeal carcinomatosis of merely 4.9 months, occurring at an early stage of metastatic disease. Molecular analyses showed a higher incidence of diffuse type carcinoma among patients with leptomeningeal carcinomatosis (85%), aligning with established literature characterizing this subtype of gastric cancer as notably aggressive.

In the context of a rare tumor, where evidence regarding its potential impact on mortality is lacking, effective treatments for brain involvement are limited, and information on cost-effectiveness is scarce, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) do not recommend routine brain MRI staging for the gastroesophageal population. Nonetheless, the NCCN recommends brain MRI when patients present with neurological symptoms. Brain metastases can present in various ways, mainly linked to the expansion of the tumor mass and the resulting edema, causing symptoms in most patients. In our study, the most prevalent symptoms were sensory or motor neurological deficits, followed by headaches and confusion, encompassing both brain metastasis and leptomeningeal patients. Additional symptoms included ataxia, seizures, nausea, vomiting, and dizziness. When these symptoms are present, further investigation for potential brain metastasis should be considered.

### Treatment pattern and outcomes of leptomeningeal carcinomatosis in India-a retrospective study [^60319414]. The Lancet Regional Health: Southeast Asia (2024). High credibility.

Methods

A multicentric retrospective analysis was conducted across 15 centres in India.

The study was conducted after Ethics Committee clearance and in accordance with the standards of Declaration of Helsinki, International Council for Harmonisation (ICH)–Good Clinical Practice (GCP), and the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). The study was conceptualised in December 2019 and the data collection was done in January to March 2020. The study was presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) annual conference of 2021. The study adhered to Strengthening the Reporting of Observational studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) guidelines. The flowchart is depicted in Fig. 1.

Fig. 1
STROBE flowchart for this study.

Patient selection

Adult patients (age ≥ 18 years) with LMC, treated between January 2010 and December 2019 were selected for this analysis. The diagnosis of leptomeningeal carcinomatosis was per European Association of Neuro-Oncology (EANO)guidelines as 'confirmed', 'probable' or 'possible'. The definition of 'confirmed' LMC was if there was the presence of positive cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cytology. In the absence of positive CSF cytology, if there was a presence of typical MRI features of leptomeningeal carcinomatosis with typical clinical features, it was labelled as 'probable' LMC. A diagnosis of 'possible' LMC was made if the CSF cytology was negative with absence of typical features on MRI but with the presence of typical clinical features. Patients with LMC due to leukaemia were excluded.

Data collection

The data was collected on a predefined data collection sheet which was shared with all investigators. The data collected was of baseline characteristics at the time of diagnosis of LMC, previous treatment records, disease status with molecular details, the pattern of care, the treatment offered, response and overall survival.

Outcomes

Overall survival was defined as the time in days from date of diagnosis of LMC to date of death or date of last follow up whichever was applicable.

### Leptomeningeal carcinomatosis and brain metastases in gastroesophageal carcinoma: a real-world analysis of clinical and pathologic characteristics and outcomes [^b98a975e]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In our retrospective cohort study, we observed a higher prevalence of HER2 positivity in cases of brain metastasis compared to leptomeningeal carcinomatosis. Notably, patients with brain metastasis and HER2-positive disease exhibited a tendency to manifest brain metastasis at a later stage compared to those with HER2-negative disease. Additionally, our findings indicated that among patients with brain metastases from gastroesophageal diseased patients who underwent brain metastasis resection followed by radiotherapy had an improved survival. Furthermore, individuals with leptomeningeal carcinomatosis who underwent whole-brain radiotherapy exhibited prolonged survival compared to those receiving best supportive care. Nevertheless, it is essential to recognize the potential impact of selection bias, including factors such as a lower number of brain metastases and a higher overall performance status, on the selection of treatment modalities. To address these questions with greater precision, multicenter studies, prospective investigations, and clinical trials would be instrumental.

### Gastric adenocarcinoma with leptomeningeal carcinomatosis as the presenting manifestation: an autopsy case report [^a5a29aad]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2005). Low credibility.

Leptomeningeal carcinomatosis is a clinically important and severe complication in patients with cancer. Leptomeningeal involvement as a secondary event in gastric carcinoma is rarely reported and usually occurs late in advanced disease. Herein, we report a case of leptomeningeal carcinomatosis as the initial manifestation of a previously asymptomatic gastric adenocarcinoma. The clinical features and the appropriate diagnostic procedures are discussed.

Discussion

LMD represents a significant and increasingly frequent challenge in the care for cancer patients. Current treatment options rarely improve clinical outcomes and there is an urgent need for effective novel therapies. Unfortunately, the developmental pipeline for investigational agents is hindered by several factors owing to the late manifestation of LMD such as heavy pre-treatment history, widely metastatic cancer often with acquired resistance, poor performance status, and dismal prognosis at the time of diagnosis measured in weeks. A synergy of these factors drives a vicious cycle of patients in dire need of new treatment options who are typically excluded from clinical trial participation. In the era of immunotherapy, there is renewed hope for advances in the treatment of LMD. In this Phase 2 study, we demonstrate that combination treatment with CTLA4 and PD1 inhibitors was safe and associated with a 3-months OS of 44% in a heavily pre-treated population of patients with LMD.

We designed our trial with several LMD-specific considerations in mind given the difficulty in assessing treatment response clinically, radiographically, and pathologically. Our patient cohort was heavily pretreated with an average of 3.1 prior systemic therapies and 78% of patients had a performance status of 1 or higher. Using a Simon two-stage design, we selected a stringent overall survival threshold at 3 months as a primary endpoint — nearly double the poor median survival of 3–7 weeks observed in this population in historical series. We deliberately avoided surrogate endpoints and instead relied on modern iRANO criteriato more objectively assess responses in the CNS and showed that 39% of patients had stable disease in the CNS as their best response. Our cohort included a dominant fraction of patients with breast cancer — a histology with a high propensity to develop LMD — and other primary tumor histologies such as glioblastoma and other primary brain tumors which have previously been felt to demonstrate limited response to immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI). In fact, of the 8 patients alive at 3 months, 5 had breast cancer as their primary tumor diagnosis while two had LMD arising from primary brain tumors (glioblastoma and ependymoma).

### Diagnosis and treatment patterns for patients with leptomeningeal metastasis from solid tumors across Europe [^de55173a]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2017). Low credibility.

Leptomeningeal metastases are a late manifestation of systemic cancer which affects up to 10% of patients with solid tumors. Prognosis is poor, and overall survival at 1 year is only approximately 10%. Management depends mainly on general and neurological condition, primary tumor, and patterns of metastasis, notably absence or presence of concurrent systemic or solid brain metastases. Here we set out to characterize current practice patterns of diagnosis and treatment of patients with leptomeningeal metastasis in Europe. We prepared a web-based survey including 25 simple or multiple choices questions on best practice supplemented by eight case vignettes with various diagnosis and management options. The survey was sent to the membership of the European Association of Neuro-Oncology and the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Brain Tumor Group. Between April 7, 2016 and August 8, 2016, 224 colleagues from 26 countries initiated the survey, 115 colleagues completed the whole survey. There were major differences both in the general diagnostic and therapeutic approach, e.g., regarding the use of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow studies, intra-CSF chemotherapy, various types of radiotherapy, and even more so when selecting decisions on diagnostic and therapeutic measures for single case vignettes. Diagnosis and treatment decisions for patients with leptomeningeal metastasis from solid tumors vary widely across Europe. Standardization of diagnosis and evaluation tools as well as controlled studies to improve the level of evidence for all therapeutic approaches to LM are required.

### Novel approaches to treatment of leptomeningeal metastases [^77ef4e16]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The incidence of leptomeningeal metastases is increasing in the setting of improved survival from systemic cancers. In more recent years, our understanding of leptomeningeal metastasis pathogenesis, how to diagnose and treat has been evolving.

Recent Findings

Diagnosing leptomeningeal metastasis has been challenging due to the limitations of cytology and neuroimaging; However, newer techniques detecting circulating tumor cells (CTCs) or circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) have shown potential advantage with diagnosis, quantification and detection of oncogenic mutations. The use of small molecule inhibitors and immunotherapy has shown some promise in specific leptomeningeal metastasis subtypes.

Summary

These new discoveries have improved clinical trials' ability to assess treatment response and thereby more optimally compare different treatments. Furthermore, they have helped the individual clinician better diagnose, monitor the disease and provide novel therapies.

### Inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy versus leptomeningeal disease following ipilimumab [^ddd22244]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Leptomeningeal carcinomatosis and inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, whether idiopathic or related to Ipilimumab or other immunomodulatory agents, may have similar clinical presentation, making it difficult to distinguish them. MRI is usually the initial study in patients presenting with signs/symptoms of spinal involvement. The finding of involvement of nerve roots, usually in a smooth, non-nodular fashion, with sparing of the surface of the cord should raise suspicion of an autoimmune, inflammatory process. Since immunomodulatory treatment may improve the course of this condition, more aggressive evaluation, such as NCS and CSF studies and evaluation by a neurologist are recommended. Inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathies whether causally related to malignancy, immunotherapy, or not are complex and recommended treatments differ. Further studies in this area are clearly warranted.

Abstract

Leptomeningeal metastasis (LM) is a devastating complication of cancer with variable clinical presentation and limited benefit from existing treatment options. In this review, we discuss advances in LM diagnostics and therapeutics with the potential to reverse this grim course. Emerging cerebrospinal fluid circulating tumor cell and cell-free tumor DNA analysis technologies will improve diagnosis of LM, while providing crucial genetic information, capturing tumor heterogeneity, and quantifying disease burden. Circulating tumor cells and cell-free tumor DNA have utility as biomarkers to track disease progression and treatment response. Treatment options for LM include ventriculoperitoneal shunting for symptomatic relief, radiation therapy including whole-brain radiation and focal radiation for bulky leptomeningeal involvement, and systemic and intrathecal medical therapies, including targeted and immunotherapies based on tumor mutational profiling. While existing treatments for LM have limited efficacy, recent advances in liquid biopsy together with increasing availability of targeted treatments will lead to rational multimodal individualized treatments and improved patient outcomes.

Leptomeningeal metastases — definition, incidence, origins, dissemination, symptoms, and prognosis are summarized. Leptomeningeal metastasis or neoplastic meningitis refers to malignant cells' multifocal seeding of the leptomeninges and is known as leptomeningeal carcinomatosis or carcinomatosis meningitis when the cells originate from a solid tumor; when related to systemic lymphoma it is called lymphomatous meningitis, and when associated with leukemia it is termed leukemic meningitis. Leptomeningeal metastasis occurs in approximately 5% of patients with cancer, with most cases arising from breast cancers, lung cancers, and melanoma; tumor cells gain access to the leptomeninges by hematogenous dissemination, lymphatic spread, or direct extension and, once in the CSF, are disseminated throughout the neuraxis by the constant flow of CSF. Common symptoms depend on location of involvement and can include spinal cord-related pain, focal motor or sensory dysfunction, bowel/bladder dysfunction, and ventricular system signs such as headache, nausea/vomiting, and confusion; the median survival is typically 2 to 4 months, survival may be extended by early detection and intervention, and the underlying tumor type can have some impact on OS.

Leptomeningeal metastases — epidemiology, presentation, and outcomes: Leptomeningeal metastasis occurs in approximately 5% of patients with cancer, most cases arise from breast cancers, lung cancers, and melanoma, and tumor cells gain access to the leptomeninges by hematogenous dissemination, lymphatic spread, or direct extension with dissemination throughout the neuraxis by the constant flow of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Infiltration of the leptomeninges by any malignancy is a serious complication that results in substantial morbidity and mortality, with common symptoms depending on location including new cranial nerve palsies when the posterior fossa is involved, spinal cord-related symptoms such as pain, focal motor or sensory dysfunction, and bowel/bladder dysfunction, and ventricular system involvement with headache, nausea/vomiting, and confusion. The median survival of patients diagnosed with this disorder is typically 2 to 4 months, although survival may be extended by early detection and intervention, and the underlying tumor type can have some impact on overall survival.

### Advances in the diagnosis, evaluation, and management of leptomeningeal disease [^697e9615]. Neuro-Oncology Advances (2021). Medium credibility.

The tissues surrounding the brain and the spinal cord, or meninges, are comprised of the outer pachymeninges and the inner leptomeninges. The pachymeninges consist of the osteal and meningeal layers of the dura mater. The pachymeninges are served by the systemic circulation and lie outside the blood-brain and blood-cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) barrier systems. The leptomeninges include the multilayered arachnoid membranes and pia mater and contain the circulating CSF. The leptomeninges reside behind the blood-CSF-barrier and may host a number of neurologic conditions including infections, inflammatory conditions as well as cancer. Spread of cancer cells into pia mater and the arachnoid membrane is referred to as leptomeningeal metastasis (LM).

Reflecting the diffuse nature of the disease location, LM is associated with a myriad of clinical manifestations that lead to substantial morbidity. CNS involvement from LM can result in encephalopathy, headache, seizures, and multiple cranial neuropathies with associated diplopia, dysphagia, and dysarthria. Impaired CSF resorption due to LM can cause obstructive hydrocephalus and symptoms of increased intracranial pressure. Spine involvement from LM may lead to pain, weakness, dysautonomia, and genitourinary dysfunction. Despite debilitating clinical symptoms, establishing the diagnosis can be challenging due to significant limitations in available radiographic and laboratory studies.

LM carries a grim prognosis. Survival following diagnosis of LM from solid organ tumors such as lung cancer and breast cancer averages less than three to six months despite treatments including supportive care, radiation therapy, and intrathecal chemotherapy. Some variability in prognosis based on tumor type has been reported with LM secondary to lung cancer associated with poorer prognosis compared to breast cancer and melanoma. Tumor subtype can influence the prognosis as well with HER2+ and hormone receptor-positive breast cancer associated with better prognosis compared to hormone negative tumorsand prolonged survival reported in EGFR mutant lung cancer treated with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors compared to LM from other non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs). This bleak outcome is a direct result of major roadblocks in the study of LM, which impede the development of effective treatments and include: 1. Diagnostic challenge; 2. Inability to quantitate disease burden; 3. Genetic heterogeneity. However, many of these barriers will soon be overcome. Herein we review these emerging diagnostic tools for better detection, quantification, and prognostication of LM as well as multiple treatment modalities that portend improvements in management of this devastating complication of cancer.

### Leptomeningeal metastases from solid malignancy: a review [^61db885f]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2005). Low credibility.

Leptomeningeal metastases (LMM) consist of diffuse involvement of the leptomeninges by infiltrating cancer cells. In solid tumors, the most frequent primary sites are lung and breast cancers, two tumors where the incidence of LMM is apparently increasing. Careful neurological examination is required to demonstrate multifocal involvement of the central nervous system (CNS), cranial nerves, and spinal roots, which constitute the clinical hallmark of the disease. Cerebro-spinal fluid (CSF) analysis is almost always abnormal but only a positive cytology or demonstration of intrathecal synthesis of tumor markers is diagnostic. T1-weighted gadolinium-enhanced sequence of the entire neuraxis (brain and spine) plays an important role in supporting the diagnosis, demonstrating the involved sites and guiding treatment. Radionuclide CSF flow studies detect CSF compartmentalization and are useful for treatment planning. Standard therapy relies mainly on focal irradiation and intrathecal or systemic chemotherapy. Studies using other therapeutic approaches such as new biological or cytotoxic compounds are ongoing. The overall prognosis remains grim and quality of life should remain the priority when deciding which treatment option to apply. However, a sub-group of patients, tentatively defined here, may benefit from an aggressive treatment.

### Novel methods to diagnose leptomeningeal metastases in breast cancer [^3f424627]. Neuro-Oncology (2019). Medium credibility.

Leptomeningeal metastases (LM) in breast cancer patients are rare but often accompanied by devastating neurological symptoms and carry a very poor prognosis, even if treated. To date, two diagnostic methods are clinically used to diagnose LM: gadolinium MRI of the brain and/or spinal cord and cytological examination of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Both techniques are, however, hampered by limited sensitivities, often leading to a long diagnostic process requiring repeated lumbar punctures and MRI examinations. To improve the detection rate of LM, numerous studies have assessed new techniques. In this review, we present the current workup to diagnose LM, set out an overview of novel techniques to diagnose LM, and give recommendations for future research.

### NANO-LM: an updated scorecard for the clinical assessment of patients with leptomeningeal metastases [^c8fe920f]. Neuro-Oncology (2025). Medium credibility.

Key Points

A validated scorecard is currently missing.
The RANO-LM group has agreed on an updated NANO-LM consensus scorecard.
An international prospective validation study is currently ongoing.

Importance of the Study

Clinical assessment of patients with leptomeningeal metastases (LM) should be reliable and reproducible. A validated scorecard is currently missing. Patients may present with various symptoms and signs depending on the location of LM. A minimum list of domains should be explored at baseline and during the course of the disease. Clinical response is part of the overall LM response assessment. Clear instructions need to be provided to the examiner to obtain an adequate and reliable assessment when judging the efficacy of a therapeutic approach in LM, both in the context of clinical trials and in clinical practice. The RANO-LM group has agreed on an updated NANO-LM consensus scorecard. An international prospective study is currently ongoing to validate this updated scorecard.

Leptomeningeal metastases (LM) are usually a late and life-threatening complication in patients with metastatic cancer. They are estimated to occur in up to 10% of patients with metastatic cancer and are still probably underdiagnosed. The median survival is limited to a few months for the majority of patients. Several efforts to improve the diagnosis, management, and follow-up of patients with LM are ongoing. The number of trials dedicated to LMor brain metastasis trials including a study arm dedicated to patients with LM is also increasing.

The clinical neurological assessment is key in disease monitoring, and standardization is essential because of the need for a reliable and reproducible local assessment. In contrast to imaging and pathological assessment, a central review of clinical evaluation is almost impossible unless these assessments are filmed for later assessment. Moreover, rapid clinical deterioration may be observed, making it sometimes difficult to obtain an MRI to objectively document progression. Therefore, clinical examination is key to evaluate LM during the entire course of the disease and, in some cases, the only tool to define the disease progression.

### Leptomeningeal carcinomatosis in chronic lymphocytic leukemia: a case report and review of the literature [^7bf62066]. The Oncologist (2019). Medium credibility.

Leptomeningeal disease is a rare complication of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). We report a case of leptomeningeal disease in CLL with a complete clinical response and clearance of cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) after treatment with ibrutinib and intrathecal rituximab. In a comprehensive review of the published literature since 1976, we found 136 cases of CLL with leptomeningeal spread. We found that leptomeningeal disease in patients with CLL responds favorably to treatment in most cases and is associated with longer overall survival than is expected for other cancers. Clearance of CSF is associated with improved survival. Treatment with rituximab and ibrutinib is more frequently associated with complete response compared with older agents. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: The incidence of leptomeningeal CLL is more common than previously described and can be recognized by attention to certain symptoms and signs. This case presentation and literature review reveals that, in many cases, leptomeningeal lymphomatosis is reversible with the use of rituximab and ibrutinib. The authors show a survival benefit associated with treating to cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) clearance by cytology and compare outcomes with various treatment strategies, focusing on novel agents. Now that there is effective therapy for leptomeningeal lymphoma in CLL, the importance for oncologists to recognize this neurologic complication has become clear.

### Leptomeningeal carcinomatosis presenting as catatonia [^0c29761c]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Lung cancer is a common cause of cancer deaths worldwide. Cancer molecular profiling of somatic mutations in lung cancer helps both predict the underlying biology and identify therapeutic targets. c-ROS proto-oncogene 1 receptor tyrosine kinase (ROS1) rearranged lung cancer is a rare molecular subtype of lung cancer that is associated with central nervous system metastases and amenable to targeted therapy. We present a case of a patient with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer with a ROS1 rearrangement who acutely presented with catatonia while on targeted treatment. A full diagnostic workup revealed that the acute decline was secondary to leptomeningeal carcinomatosis (LMC). This case report describes the diagnostic workup for this atypical presentation of LMC and the subsequent treatment strategies. This case challenges the traditional paradigm that patients admitted with cancer-related decline are not candidates for systemic therapy and highlights the key role of collaboration with the oncology team.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: central nervous system cancers, version 2.2022 [^60d28bac]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2023). High credibility.

Leptomeningeal metastases — patient evaluation and CSF diagnosis: Patients present with signs and symptoms ranging from injury to nerves that traverse the subarachnoid space, direct tumor invasion of the brain or spinal cord, alteration of the local blood supply, obstruction of normal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow pathways leading to increased intracranial pressure, or interference with normal brain function. Patients should have a physical examination with a careful neurologic evaluation, and MRI of the brain and spine should also be performed for accurate staging, particularly if the patient is a candidate for active treatment. A definitive diagnosis is most commonly made by CSF analysis via lumbar puncture if it is safe for the patient, and CSF protein is typically increased with possible pleocytosis or decreased glucose levels and ultimately positive CSF cytology for tumor cells. Assessment of circulating tumor cells increases the sensitivity of tumor cell detection in CSF, is now CLIA-approved in some states, and should be done when it is available. CSF cytology testing has approximately 50% sensitivity with the first lumbar puncture, and up to 90% sensitivity after repeated CSF analyses in affected patients, and clinicians should be aware that lumbar punctures may be contraindicated in patients with anticoagulation, thrombocytopenia, or bulky intracranial disease.

### Leptomeningeal carcinomatosis and brain metastases in gastroesophageal carcinoma: a real-world analysis of clinical and pathologic characteristics and outcomes [^6cf61b33]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Gastric adenocarcinoma is the fifth most common malignancy and the fourth most frequent cause of cancer-associated death worldwide, with approximately 1,100,000 new incident cases and about 800,000 related mortalities estimated in 2020. Regarding esophageal cancer, there were approximately 604,100 newly reported cases and 544,100 fatalities. Predominantly, 85% of the cases (512,500 cases) were squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs), while adenocarcinoma accounted for 14% of the cases (85,700 cases).

Brain metastasis (BrM) and leptomeningeal carcinomatosis (LMC) are rare complications associated with gastroesophageal carcinoma (GEC). The occurrence of BrM ranges from 0.7 to 6.6%, while the incidence of LMC varies between 0.16% and 0.19%. The complications are associated with neurologic morbidity and poor prognosis and quality of life, with median survival historically reported to be in the range of 2 to 6 months after its diagnosis.

Clinical risk factors for BrM development are poorly understood, although associations have been found with higher lymph node (N) stage and the presence of other metastases (particularly liver, lung, and bone). Several studies have noted the enrichment of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) overexpression among patients with gastroesophageal cancer and brain metastases; however, it is unclear if this is a risk factor in patients with leptomeningeal carcinomatosis.

Treatment of brain metastasis and leptomeningeal carcinomatosis is challenging because most systemic chemotherapeutics in use have limited permeability across the blood brain barrier. Therefore, treatment of brain metastasis relies on surgical resection and/or radiotherapy as treatment modalities and leptomeningeal carcinomatosis, on whole brain radiation therapy and, in selected cases, intrathecal chemotherapy.

Given the limited data available regarding clinical features, prognostication, and treatment of CNS metastasis from gastroesophageal carcinoma, the objective of our study was to characterize the clinical, molecular features and outcomes of patients in this comprehensive cohort population investigation.

### Treatment pattern and outcomes of leptomeningeal carcinomatosis in India-a retrospective study [^cd89a190]. The Lancet Regional Health: Southeast Asia (2024). High credibility.

LMC is observed in approximately 10% of patients with solid tumour cancer. Breast cancer, lung cancer and melanoma are three malignancies commonly associated with LMC. With recent developments in systemic therapies, there is a significant improvement in the extracranial control of the above three mentioned malignancies. As a result of this improvement in extracranial control, there is an increase in relapse seen in sanctuary sites such as the central nervous system. In general, there is an increase in incidence of both brain parenchymal lesions as well as LMC. It is hypothesised that in addition to improvement in systemic control and prolonged survival, a combination of other factors like improved imaging techniques and a lower threshold for initiating diagnostic work-up have led to increase the incidence and prevalence of LMC. Median time between diagnosis of systemic cancer and diagnosis of LMC is around 1–2 years. Developments in management of leptomeningeal metastasis of solid tumours majorly include systemic chemotherapy, intrathecal therapy and irradiation. However, impact of these management modalities on prognosis currently varies widely. LMC has a dismal prognosis and hence there is a need for improvement in outcomes. Till now, only few randomised trials were conducted and previous observational studies are mostly retrospective. Also, very limited literature is available from India and other low-income and middle-income countries (LMIC). The applicability of retrospective studies' from high-income countries in LMIC is questionable and warrants further review. The advances in systemic treatment in solid tumours that have led to improved outcomes have become inaccessible to a large proportion of patients in India and other LMICs. We aimed to understand the current prevalence of LMC and management in India. Hence, we did a retrospective country-wide analysis to determine the pattern of care and outcomes in solid tumour patients with LMC.

### Leptomeningeal carcinomatosis originating from gastric cancer: report of eight cases and review of the literature [^f8cb293a]. American Journal of Clinical Oncology (2003). Low credibility.

Leptomeningeal carcinomatosis caused by metastatic gastric adenocarcinoma has been rarely reported in the United States. We present eight cases of patients with gastric cancer who subsequently developed meningeal carcinomatosis. On average, patients presented with symptoms of leptomeningeal disease (LMD) 12 months after the initial diagnosis. Distinguishing features include a predominance of poorly differentiated histology, typically associated with signet ring cells, a diffuse pattern of primary organ involvement, systemic dissemination in the form of peritoneal carcinomatosis, and development of LMD despite responsiveness to chemotherapy elsewhere in the body. The natural history of these patients, with or without treatment, was uniformly poor. Although previously thought to be an extremely rare event, LMD in the setting of gastric adenocarcinoma may be a problem on the rise, possibly due to the increasing survival times of patients. Physicians should have a high index of suspicion since no single test can reliably diagnose this entity in all cases. Furthermore, the striking clinical picture of patients with LMD raises interesting questions about the biology and metastatic behavior of certain subclasses of gastric cancer.

### Phase II study of ipilimumab and nivolumab in leptomeningeal carcinomatosis [^600385f0]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Recently, there have been remarkable advances in the treatment of parenchymal brain metastases with immune checkpoint inhibitors such as ipilimumab — a cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA4) inhibitor — and nivolumab — an anti-programmed death 1 agent (PD1) inhibitor — demonstrating promising intracranial activity in patients who have traditionally been excluded from clinical trials –. While increasing participation of patients with brain metastases in modern investigational efforts is encouraging, patients with leptomeningeal carcinomatosis represent an understudied population and could be uniquely poised to derive improved outcomes in the era of immunotherapy. Here, we present a phase II single-arm clinical trial in patients with LMD from diverse primary solid tumor histologies showing promising intracranial activity of combined ipilimumab and nivolumab associated with improved overall survival compared to historical controls, and an acceptable safety profile.

### Leptomeningeal carcinomatosis in colorectal cancer: the mayo clinic experience [^336e3553]. Clinical Colorectal Cancer (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Leptomeningeal metastasis (LM) is an uncommon form of metastatic disease in many cancers. There remains a paucity of literature with regard to the course and management of LM in colorectal cancers (CRCs). The aim of this study was to estimate the incidence of LM in patients with CRC seen at our institution over a 15-year period, and to describe the clinical course and outcome of these cases.

Methods

LM in CRC primary cases between 2000 and 2014 were identified in the Mayo Clinic databases. The charts were retrospectively reviewed.

Results

Of 17,095 CRC primaries, we identified 10 patients with LM (0.058%) in this 15-year period. Nine cases were included in the analysis. Four had metastatic disease at the time of their initial CRC diagnosis. Median overall survival after CRC diagnosis was 25.7 months (range, 4.7–74.8 months). Median time to diagnosis of LM after CRC diagnosis was 25.3 months (range, 0–68.1 months). All patients had magnetic resonance imaging findings consistent with LM: 3 patients with spinal LM, 5 patients with intracranial LM, and 1 with both. Neurologic symptoms correlated with site of the lesions, with headache, cranial nerve palsy, lower extremity weakness, and gait disturbance among the most frequently reported. However, not all patients had neurologic findings, with LM lesions found incidentally in 2 cases. Seven patients (78%) had palliative radiotherapy for LM. Three patients continued to receive systemic chemotherapy after diagnosis of LM. Median survival after LM diagnosis was 7 weeks (range, 2–39 weeks).

Conclusions

LM is an exceedingly rare development in the natural course of CRC. It confers a poor prognosis with limited treatment options. At our institution, most patients had their disease addressed by palliative means, with many receiving radiotherapy to control their neurologic symptoms. Based on our series, supportive care remains a sensible approach to the management of LM in CRC.

Epidemiology

The incidence of LM is challenging to quantify. Large-scale population and autopsy-based analyses provide an estimation of brain metastase incidence per cancer subtype. However, reliable data on the most basic epidemiologic features of LM (eg, incidence, survival, and cause of death) are lacking because such encompassing surveys have not been conducted specifically for LM, and those that exist utilize relatively insensitive diagnostic criteria which have often been inconsistently applied. Smaller institutional reviews and autopsy studies have quoted the incidence of LM in advanced malignancies to approximate 9%–25% for small cell and non-small cell lung cancer, 5%–20% for breast cancer, and 6%–18% for melanoma.

Even more elusive is the prognosis of LM stratified by factors such as age, tumor histology, molecular features, and clinical characteristics. Among patients with brain metastases and despite improving treatments for CNS dissemination, the presence of LM remains an independent predictor of inferior survival. Studies addressing the vital questions of treatment and prophylaxis of LM depend on high-quality data not only about incidence and outcome, but also how these endpoints are modified by common and prognostically important variables. A "historical median survival" of 2–4 months has been applied to all patients with newly diagnosed LM, and has served, often inappropriately, as a survival benchmark for many clinical trials in this patient population. However, despite the generally incurable nature of LM, modern therapeutics have introduced more heterogeneity in leptomeningeal progression-free and overall survival, with certain patient populations far exceeding this historical survival estimate. Consequently, prognostic discussions with patients and the design of clinical trials should not rely on an outdated "one size fits all" survival estimate, and large, contemporary population-based data are needed to provide more granularity to this topic.

### Association of MRI findings with clinical characteristics and prognosis in patients with leptomeningeal carcinomatosis from non-small cell lung cancer [^aaec3e6f]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Magnetic resonance imagining (MRI) is helpful for diagnosis of leptomeningeal carcinomatosis (LMC) and localizing LMC symptoms. Goal of this study is how MRI findings of LMC are associated with clinical characteristics or prognosis in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

Methods

We retrospectively collected data on 283 patients with LMC from NSCLC, adenocarcinoma based on cerebrospinal fluid cytology. All patients had brain MRI with gadolinium enhancement at LMC diagnosis, and spinal MRI was performed at the physician's discretion. We evaluated the prognostic factors for overall survival (OS) of all patients and subgroup of patients with central nervous system cause of death.

Results

Two-hundred sixteen patients (76%) had definite or suggestive LMC findings and 67 had negative findings on brain MRI. Of the 37 patients who presented with cauda equina syndrome, 35 (95%) exhibited typical spinal MRI findings. Median OS of all patients was 3.65 months (95% confidence interval, 3.06–4.18). There was no significant difference in median OS between MRI-negative and MRI-positive groups (4.31 vs. 3.48 months, p = 0.711), whereas negative MRI finding showed longer median OS significantly in a subgroup of 77 patients with a central nervous system cause of death (p = 0.035). Considering clinical characteristics, progressive systemic disease, and altered mentality were significant prognostic factors associated with poor OS, whereas presenting symptom of headache with nausea/vomiting, intra-CSF chemotherapy, WBRT after LMC diagnosis, and concurrent RTKi treatment were significant for favorable OS in multivariable analysis.

Conclusions

Positive MRI findings suggests heavier disease burden than negative MRI findings in patients with LMC who died of a central nervous system cause. Spinal MRI findings in patients with LMC correlate with cauda equina symptoms.

### Treatment pattern and outcomes of leptomeningeal carcinomatosis in India-a retrospective study [^41ec735b]. The Lancet Regional Health: Southeast Asia (2024). High credibility.

This data indicates that despite a substantial proportion of patients having targetable driver mutations, outcomes of LMC remain dismal in LMIC. This suggests that the current treatment landscape in LMICs is insufficient to adequately treat leptomeningeal carcinomatosis as outcomes have remained low even in those with targetable mutations. There is a need for the development of new treatment options like CNS-penetrating immunotherapy acknowledging that the evidence of existing treatment modalities like radiotherapy (RT) does suggest that it improves outcomes however this is scant and unsubstantiated at this point in time.

Another important facet is the cost-effectiveness of early screening modalities to screen for and identify LMC before symptoms with solid tumours in LMICs. A high percentage of LMC is seen only at autopsy compared the reported numbers with a definitive diagnosis coupled with the poor prognosis from leptomeningeal carcinomatosis suggests that early, widespread and periodic screening would very likely play a role in lowering mortality from it. However, on the other hand, the high-cost burden of this screening via imaging modalities coupled with the barrier of financial access to effective CNS-penetrating therapy raises the question of the feasibility of this strategy in LMICs. The optimal strategy lies somewhere on this spectrum where cheaper, more easily accessible screening strategies with good sensitivity would allow a smaller number to require the resource-burdening confirmatory test of high specificity to allow the most fertile situation for shared decision making of treatment between patient and doctor.

The strength of the current study is the multicentric real-world data across multiple primary tumours. The study also had few limitations, viz. treatment algorithms were heterogeneous and very few patients had exposure to 3rd generation TKIs. Unfortunately, we have not collected data on progression-free survival. The data generation for the current study was possible because of wide collaboration between clinicians at different centres. Thus, clinicians could have had differing protocols for follow-up procedures and timing. Due to this, we did not gather data on progression-free survival (PFS) as we could not maintain uniformity for reliable PFS data.

LMC has a grave prognosis and nearly one-third of the patients are treated with the best supportive care due to dismal prognosis. Intrathecal therapy, though part of guidelines, is administered in only 39% of patients with leptomeningeal carcinomatosis. IT therapy and lung primary are associated with relatively improved outcomes. This data can serve as a benchmark for further improvement to facilitate studies for further improving the outcomes.

Conclusion

This work contributes to the growing body of literature advocating for a more nuanced understanding of LMD and the need for entity-specific treatment approaches to enhance patient care. The study emphasizes the necessity of prospective, interdisciplinary, multi-center registries to better capture the complexity and heterogeneity of LMD patient populations and treatment responses, ultimately guiding more effective and personalized yet standardized and timely therapeutic interventions. The significant prognostic impact of the primary tumor type at LMD diagnosis warrants prospective entity-specific trials.

Conclusion

Our understanding of LM biology and management has increased exponentially in the last decade, brought forth by improvements in preclinical disease-specific modeling, the expansion of molecular- and immune-mediated treatment strategies, improved craniospinal radiation techniques, and advocacy on the parts of cancer organizations, philanthropic support systems, clinicians, scientists, and patients to prioritize scientific research in this field. Select patient populations with LM are now exceeding the historical odds of survival, and while still considered a largely incurable condition, durable treatment options beyond the historical palliative approaches appear to be within reach. In this modern wave of cancer innovation, efforts must continue to prioritize the optimization and standardization of biospecimen handling, clinical response criteria, and best research practices for the study of LM. The development of a de-identified international LM registry with demographic- and cancer-specific variables would provide a wealth of valuable information regarding the natural history of this disease by cancer type, and potentially provide a viable pathway for clinically annotated biospecimen sharing for further research and drug discovery. Multi-institutional and international collaboration with respect to clinical trial execution is essential to support the expansion of investigator-initiated and pharmaceutical-sponsored randomized trials specific for patients with LM.

### Phase II study of ipilimumab and nivolumab in leptomeningeal carcinomatosis [^9476e867]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Leptomeningeal disease (LMD), also known as leptomeningeal carcinomatosis or carcinomatosis meningitis, is a phenomenon characterized by metastatic dissemination of cancer cells to the leptomeninges. LMD has been reported to occur in up to 10% of solid tumors and in 5–15% of hematological malignancies –. Incidence is increasing owing to improved systemic therapies resulting in longer patient survival as well as development of more sensitive detection methods. Primary solid tumor histologies most frequently associated with development of LMD include those from breast, lung, and skin (melanoma) origins. Although LMD is often identified concurrently with parenchymal disease, it can also occur in the absence of parenchymal brain metastases. Presenting symptoms can include headache, nausea, vomiting, neurological deficits, and gait instability. Unfortunately, the prognosis for patients that develop LMD is poor ranging from 3 to 7 weeks on average.

Although several treatment modalities are available to patients with LMD, there is significant practice variation due to a paucity of data from prospective clinical trials. Multimodality therapy is often employed for palliation of symptoms and optimizing quality of life as opposed to prolonging survival. Radiation therapy approaches include stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) typically for large, bulky, and symptom-causing lesions, whole-brain radiation therapy (WBRT) for those with poor performance status who are unlikely to tolerate other treatment modalities and craniospinal irradiation (CSI). In clinical trials, systemic and intrathecal therapies (IT) have demonstrated mixed results for survival benefit, likely owing to multiple factors such as heterogeneous primary tumor biology, clinical trial enrollment bias toward more fit patients, and low accrual. Toxicities from these traditional treatment approaches remain a major concern and can include leukoencephalopathy, subacute encephalopathy, acute cerebellar syndrome, aseptic meningitis (up to 43% of patients), and infectious meningitis (8–24% of patients receiving IT therapy). Patients with LMD have an urgent need for therapies that can provide a meaningful survival benefit with an acceptable toxicity profile.

NCCN recommendations — patient evaluation for suspected leptomeningeal metastases: Patients should have a physical examination with a careful neurologic evaluation and MRI of the brain and spine for accurate staging, and a definitive diagnosis is most commonly made by cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis via lumbar puncture if it is safe. CSF protein is typically increased with possible pleocytosis or decreased glucose levels and ultimately positive CSF cytology for tumor cells; assessment of circulating tumor cells increases sensitivity and is now CLIA-approved in some states and should be done when it is available. CSF cytology testing has approximately 50% sensitivity with the first lumbar puncture and up to 90% sensitivity after repeated CSF analyses in affected patients, and clinicians should be aware that lumbar punctures may be contraindicated in patients with anticoagulation, thrombocytopenia, or bulky intracranial disease.

### Leptomeningeal carcinomatosis: retrospective review of a large series… [^ef18bad9]. ASCO (2022). Medium credibility.

Results: A total of 73 patients with LMC were identified, 75% female. The most common cancers were breast, lung, and melanoma. Most patients presented with intracranial hypertension, followed by cerebellar symptoms, radiculopathy, cranial nerve palsies, seizures, and other. More than half of patients had evidence of leptomeningeal involvement only, while 25% of patients had known central nervous system metastases and 19% were diagnosed simultaneously with CNS metastases. Median time from primary tumor diagnosis to LMC was 32 months. Median overall survival was 1. 57 months, with 15% of patients alive at 6 months. Patients with gynecological and lung cancer had the best mOS, and patients with melanoma had the worst mOS.

mOS in patients with evidence of meningeal involvement by MRI was 41 days, compared to 71. 5 days in patients with a negative MRI. Presenting with seizures was significantly associated with a worse prognosis. In CSF cytology, both pleocytosis.

Symptoms at CNS presentation

All patients in this study presented neurological symptoms at the time of CNS involvement. Patients could have experienced more than one symptom at the time of CNS presentation. Among patients with brain metastasis, the most prevalent symptoms were sensory, or motor neurological deficits (24 patients) followed by headaches (16 patients), as described in Fig. 2. Sensory or motor neurological deficits (13 patients), headaches (10 patients) and visual loss (10 patients) were the primary symptoms observed in patients with leptomeningeal carcinomatosis. (Fig. 3).

Histological and molecular characteristic

The molecular and histological characteristics were derived from the primary tumor. It's important to note that not all patients who underwent lumbar puncture or brain metastasis resection had their tumors retested for molecular characteristics, therefore, histological, and molecular features were not compared between the primary and corresponding metastatic tissue sample.

HER2-positive disease was defined as a score of 3 on immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis or a score of 2 + on IHC analysis with a positive result from subsequent fluorescent in situ hybridization testing. In patients where the HER2 status were known (41 patients), 61% (25 patients) were found to be HER2-positive. In the leptomeningeal carcinomatosis population with known HER2 status (13 patients), only 2 (15%) patients were HER2-positive (p -value 0.009) (Table 2). In terms of histology classification based on the Lauren system, among LMC patients, 12 (86%) had the diffuse type and 16% had the Intestinal type and no SCC were found in this population (p -value < 0.001) (Table 2).

Methods

Study population and data collection

This study is a retrospective analysis that included adult (age ≥ 18 years) patients treated at the Princess Margaret Cancer Center (PMCC) between 2007 and 2021 with a confirmed diagnosis of GEC, from which we identified patients with disease metastatic to the brain or leptomeninges. The data were collected from the electronic medical record into the Gastroesophageal Database using Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) and the study was approved by the University Health Network Research Ethics Board (REB) - CAPCR ID (REB ID 20–5884). - and adhered to the data confidentiality and privacy policy of the International Credential Evaluation Service.

For each included patient, the clinical staging was determined using the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC 6) staging manual, given the retrospective nature of this cohort. This study included adenocarcinomas of the distal esophagus, esophagogastric junction, and proximal stomach, categorized respectively as types I, II, and III using the Siewert classification. In addition, pure squamous cell carcinomas were also included, while neuroendocrine, and undifferentiated carcinomas were excluded. Two patients were found concomitantly with both brain metastasis and leptomeningeal carcinomatosis, and they were included in the LMC group analysis.

Patient characteristics, including age at diagnosis, sex, ethnicity, and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status (PS), were recorded. Tumor characteristics, including date of diagnosis, number of brain metastases, number and location(s) of extracranial metastases, clinical staging, and HER2 status, were also noted.

All patients diagnosed with brain metastasis underwent neurological imaging as part of their evaluation for neurological symptoms and confirmation of CNS metastasis. In our study, the diagnosis of leptomeningeal carcinomatosis was established by utilizing neuroimaging findings and/or cerebrospinal fluid analysis. Neuroimaging features included linear and/or nodular enhancement of the leptomeninges, cranial nerves, and spinal nerve roots. In cases where clinical symptoms suggested leptomeningeal carcinomatosis, but neuroimaging results were negative, patients underwent a lumbar puncture. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis confirmation revealed distinctive abnormalities, such as elevated protein levels, an increased count of nucleated cells, decreased glucose, and notably, the identification of neoplastic cells.

The safety profile of this combined regimen was similar to previous reports and did not demonstrate excessive neurological or autoimmune toxicity. Further study of ICI in patients with LMD is needed in larger patient populations and in combination with other therapeutic modalities such as radiation therapy or chemotherapy.

### Leptomeningeal gliomatosis as the initial presentation of gliomatosis cerebri [^91320fdf]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2010). Low credibility.

Leptomeningeal gliomatosis is a known, yet uncommon, complication of malignant gliomas. In rare instances it can present with non-specific symptoms prior to the development of detectable intraparenchymal lesions, posing a diagnostic challenge. Gliomatosis cerebri is also a rare disease, characterized by extensive diffuse infiltration of neoplastic glial cells. For both entities, limited data exist to guide treatment and prognosis is poor. We describe the case of a patient who presented with symptoms of increased intracranial pressure and diffuse leptomeningeal enhancement in the brain and spinal cord on MRI. After a period of surveillance, intraparenchymal lesions developed in association with widespread diffuse infiltration. The diagnosis of gliomatosis cerebri with diffuse leptomeningeal gliomatosis was established in hindsight. Initial treatment consisted of six cycles of temozolomide chemotherapy. Following radiological progression, the patient received craniospinal radiotherapy. Four months later the patient's symptoms had resolved and MRI demonstrated near complete response of leptomeningeal enhancement and intraparenchymal lesions. Six months after radiotherapy, the patient remains clinically well without radiographic recurrence.

### Leptomeningeal carcinomatosis in gastric cancer [^1720103a]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2004). Low credibility.

We analyzed 19 cases of cytologically confirmed leptomeningeal carcinomatosis (LMC) treated at our institution over the past 11 years. LMC was the initial manifestation of gastric cancer in 2 patients. With the exception of 1 patient, the primary gastric cancer was Borrmann type III or IV, and 88% had poorly differentiated or signet-ring cell histology. The gastric cancer was progressive or a recurrent disease in most of the patients. The distribution of extraneural metastasis suggested that Batson's venous plexus might be the predominant route to the subarachnoid space. Eighty percent of the patients had multiple neuraxis syndrome, and the combination of brain plus cranial nerve syndrome was the most common manifestation. Computed tomography (CT) findings were abnormal in a minor proportion of the patients, while magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed abnormality in 67% of the patients, which could help the diagnosis. LMC complicating gastric cancer was ultimately fatal. Median survival was very short, 4 weeks. By univariate analysis, good performance status, intrathecal chemotherapy, and low CSF LDH concentration favored survival. Multivariate analysis revealed that the administration of CSF chemotherapy was the independent prognostic factor for survival.

### Clinical features and outcomes of patients with breast cancer with leptomeningeal carcinomatosis… [^e364f71c]. ASCO (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract e13162 Background: Leptomeningeal carcinomatosis is a rare, but deadly complication in breast cancer, with prior studies showing median overall survival of 15 weeks. There is a paucity of data on histologic and receptor subtype-specific survival, and there is no standard of care currently for treatment of LMC in breast cancer. We reviewed the outcomes of a contemporary cohort of breast cancer patients with LMC. Methods: This is a single-institution retrospective analysis of 38 female breast cancer pts diagnosed with LMC between 2016–2023, based on radiographic features and/or positive cerebrospinal fluid cytology or CSF circulating tumor cells. Patients consented to share information with a research biorepository, and we conducted a chart review of their clinical features and OS with LMC. Median age at LMC diagnosis was 50 years. Median time between Stage IV and LMC diagnosis was 11 months. spine at diagnosis.

25 pts underwent CSF cytology and 13 pts underwent CSF CTC evaluation at LMC diagnosis; 14/25 pts had positive CSF cytology and 10/13 pts had detectable CSF CTCs. 21 pts underwent whole-brain radiotherapy, and 2 pts received proton craniospinal irradiation. 21 pts received IT therapy. 27 pts received at least 1 line of systemic therapy post-LMC diagnosis. Median OS between LMC diagnosis and death or last oncology follow up for the entire cohort was 5 months. There was a significant difference in median OS with LMC by receptor subtype: TNBC 3. 5 months, ER+/HER2- 8 months, and HER2+ 23 months. Conclusions: This study highlights heterogeneity in outcomes amongst breast cancer pts with LMC by receptor subtype, as well as improvement in outcomes for selected pts treated with novel therapeutics and a multidisciplinary approach.

Larger prospective studies are needed to inform treatment paradigms for LMC.

### Advances in the diagnosis, evaluation, and management of leptomeningeal disease [^1b672062]. Neuro-Oncology Advances (2021). Medium credibility.

Future Perspective

Recent advances in detection, quantification, and targeting of cancer cells within the spinal fluid have the potential to revolutionize the study and management of LM. Emerging CSF CTC and ctDNA technologies will improve diagnosis of LM and serve as biomarkers to assess disease progression and response to treatment, empowering intelligent clinical trial design and interpretation. CTC and ctDNA analysis will also provide a more detailed understanding of tumor genomics, paving the way to individualized targeted treatments focused on actionable mutations. In this way, liquid biopsies together with new targeted therapeutic approaches will enable formal clinical trials of LM enrolling carefully selected patients with quantitatively similar burden of disease, harboring biologically similar disease (as determined by driver mutation), receiving therapeutics targeting the driver mutation. This work will allow for establishment of treatment paradigms beyond our current regimens of symptomatic management with radiation therapy and ventriculoperitoneal shunting. With these tools in hand, we will make best use of intrathecal and systemic targeted and chemotherapeutic approaches to make clinically meaningful improvements for patients with LM.

### Radiation therapy in the management of leptomeningeal disease from solid tumors [^e5be743e]. Advances in Radiation Oncology (2024). Medium credibility.

Methods and Materials

In November 2022, we conducted a search of the relevant literature in PubMed and of ongoing clinical trials listed on ClinicalTrials.gov to inform a discussion on the role of RT in the management of solid tumor LMD. We used search terms including, but not limited to, combinations of such keywords as "leptomeningeal metastases", "leptomeningeal disease", "leptomeningeal carcinomatosis", "neoplastic meningitis", and "carcinomatous meningitis", as well as "radiotherapy", "radiation therapy", "irradiation", "radioisotope", and "radionuclide". Only studies written in the English language that included patients with LMD from solid tumors were reviewed. Studies of LMD from primary CNS tumors (eg, medulloblastoma) or hematologic malignancies (eg, leukemia) were excluded. All publication years were considered. Because of the paucity of high-quality published evidence, discussion was informed more by expert consensus and opinion, including a review of societal guidelines, than evidence from clinical trials.

Leptomeningeal carcinomatosis (LC) is rare in solid tumours, particularly in gastrointestinal cancers. While other treatment strategies remain undefined, inclusion of palliative care is essential due to its very poor prognosis and variable manifestations. We report a case of oesophagogastric junction adenocarcinoma, previously submitted to surgery and chemotherapy, diagnosed with LC and followed in a palliative care unit. Treatment was comanaged with the oncology team and a palliative approach was decided. In this report, we review the literature and evaluate treatment options, with focus on the importance of palliative care and its potential benefits in patients diagnosed with this rare entity.

Biology

LM occurs when tumor cells disseminate into and grow within the leptomeninges (Figure 1). The leptomeninges, consisting of the pia and inner arachnoid, surround the CNS and contain circulating CSF. Cancer cells may access the leptomeningeal space through various means, including hematogenous dissemination via the choroid plexus, direct seeding from brain and dural metastases, perineural invasion, and retrograde venous extension via Batson's plexus. Upon entry, leptomeningeal cancer cells freely circulate throughout the neuraxis driven by pulsatile CSF flow, where they exist either as adherent plaques to the surface of the brain, spinal cord, and exiting cranial and spinal nerves and/or as free-floating cells or cellular clusters.LM receives sparse nutrients leaking though the impaired blood-CSF barrier of the choroid plexus and potentially other sources as well. The blood-CSF barrier through which cancer cells and certain drugs penetrate the subarachnoid space is both anatomically and functionally distinct from the blood-brain barrier, which has therapeutic consequences when considering differential drug permeability in CNS compartments. LM are also notably distinct from metastases to the pachymeninges, consisting of the dura and outer arachnoid mater (Supplementary Figure 1). As this space is outside of the blood-brain barriers, metastases to the pachymeninges are therefore extra-axial. These pachymeningeal or dural-based metastases most commonly arise from breast and prostate cancers, or as a result of post-operative pachymeningeal seeding following resection of a brain or dural metastasis. Given the large differences in the biology, prognosis, blood supply, and management between these sites of disease, pachymeningeal metastases will not be reviewed here.

Introduction

Leptomeningeal metastases (LM) represent an aggressive, advanced stage of cancer with substantial neurologic morbidity and a grim survival of 2–5 months. Also known as leptomeningeal carcinomatosis or neoplastic meningitis, LM occurs when cancer cells gain access to the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) that surrounds the brain and spinal cord, either through hematogenous dissemination via the choroid plexus, retrograde venous extension, or direct seeding from parenchymal metastases across the glia limitans. Upon entry, LM adopts two phenotypic states: adherent plaques to the brain and spinal cord visualized with contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and free-floating cells within the spinal fluid detected via CSF cytology. As such, diagnosis and surveillance of LM require full neuraxial MRI and CSF analysis to fully stage the burden of disease. The estimated incidence of LM from systemic malignancies is approximately 5–20% based on population and autopsy data; the true incidence of LM is likely higher owing to insensitivity of CSF cytology and asymptomatic leptomeningeal seeding.

Conventional treatment of LM includes intrathecal chemotherapy for those with adequate performance status, whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT) to cranial disease and/or involved-field radiation therapy (RT) to disease of the spinal cord and cauda equina, and systemic chemotherapies with adequate central nervous system (CNS) penetration (Fig. 1). Symptoms referrable to increased intracranial pressure can be ameliorated with palliative ventriculoperitoneal shunting. For those without abnormal CSF flow dynamics, commonly used intrathecal therapy options include methotrexate, thiotepa, and topotecan. No single intrathecal chemotherapy has emerged as providing a significant survival benefit, and their use is associated with increased neurotoxicity risk.

Clinical Symptomatology and Complications

The diffuse nature of LMD often leads to multiple noncontiguous lesions, rendering it challenging to diagnose. Increased intracranial pressure (ICP) is a common manifestation, thought to be the result of the accumulation of malignant cells and protein in the CSF, which can result in communicating or non-communicating hydrocephalus. Symptoms of increased ICP include headache (often positional) with associated nausea and dizziness, gait impairment, bilateral or unilateral cranial nerve 6 palsy, cognitive changes, and papilledema. Among patients with elevated ICP, some will experience plateau waves, marked by sudden paroxysmal (often positionally provoked) ICP elevations with consequent dramatic neurologic symptoms with quick onset/offset. In select patients, treating hydrocephalus via CSF diversion or radiotherapy can lead to symptomatic improvement. Of note, given the theoretical risk of diverting cancer cells into the peritoneal space, CSF diversion is typically reserved for patients who have favorable options for CNS-directed therapy.

Independent of ICP, LMD can cause an inflammatory response resulting in headache and nuchal rigidity via meningeal disruption. LMD can also infiltrate the underlying cortex via Virchow-Robin spaces, leading to seizures (~ 22% of LMD patients) and cognitive impairment (~ 93% of patients). Given that LMD has a predilection for the posterior fossa, cerebellar involvement leading to ataxia is common. Malignant cells from LMD can also invade the cerebral arteries, leading to strokes.

LMD can affect any cranial nerve (CN), resulting in isolated or multiple cranial neuropathies. LMD most commonly affects CN II, III, VI, and VII, leading to visual impairment, diplopia, and/or facial weakness. Among LMD patients with CN involvement, 50% had multiple cranial neuropathies; this often serves as a diagnostic red flag in cancer patients who do not yet have an established LMD diagnosis. In addition to cranial nerves, LMD commonly involves spinal nerves, with symptoms of weakness, numbness, or radicular pain in the affected distribution.

### Phase II study of ipilimumab and nivolumab in leptomeningeal carcinomatosis [^3846680e]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Leptomeningeal disease (LMD) is a common complication from solid tumor malignancies with a poor prognosis and limited treatment options. We present a single arm Phase II study of 18 patients with LMD receiving combined ipilimumab and nivolumab until progression or unacceptable toxicity (NCT02939300). The primary end point is overall survival at 3 months (OS3). Secondary end points include toxicity, cumulative time-to-progression at 3 months, and progression-free survival. A Simon two-stage design is used to compare a null hypothesis OS3 of 18% against an alternative of 44%. Median follow up based on patients still alive is 8.0 months (range: 0.5 to 15.9 months). The study has met its primary endpoint as 8 of 18 (OS3 0.44; 90% CI: 0.24 to 0.66) patients are alive at three months. One third of patients have experienced one (or more) grade-3 or higher adverse events. Two patients have discontinued protocol treatment due to unacceptable toxicity (hepatitis and colitis, respectively). The most frequent adverse events include fatigue (N = 7), nausea (N = 6), fever (N = 6), anorexia (N = 6) and rash (N = 6). Combined ipilimumab and nivolumab has an acceptable safety profile and demonstrates promising activity in LMD patients. Larger, multicenter clinical trials are needed to validate these results.

### Diagnostic and therapeutic updates in leptomeningeal disease [^c0665ee2]. Current Oncology Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

LMD is a common complication of metastatic cancer, with devastating consequences in terms of overall mortality and morbidity. Diagnosis of LMD can be challenging, often requiring repetitive testing and resulting in substantial delay to treatment, further limiting our ability to extend duration and quality of life. Recent advances in diagnostics for LMD, including CTCs and cfDNA, may offer increased diagnostic sensitivity and shorten time to definitive diagnosis. While the overall prognosis of LMD remains poor across tumor types, recent studies of targeted small molecules, ADCs and IT based therapies for specific solid-tumor LMD have demonstrated an increase in overall and progression free survival, moving the needle further towards identification of durable treatment regimens for LMD.

### Brain miliary enhancement [^d3d0ed89]. Neuroradiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Miliary-enhancing brain lesions and distribution within or outside PVS

Metastatic disease

Miliary dissemination is a rare manifestation of brain metastases, and it presents as diffuse miliary spread of punctate tumour nodules often with a PVS distribution without invasion of the brain parenchyma, but a non-PVS distribution is also possible (Fig. 3c). A limited number of autopsy studies confirmed miliary-enhancing lesions in metastatic disease. This rare presentation has been reported mostly in metastatic lung adenocarcinoma, but it has been also described in metastatic melanoma and in other types of adenocarcinoma, including breast carcinoma, pancreatic, gastric and salivary gland tumours. Usually, the grey–white matter junction is the preferred site of metastatic carcinomatous cells and metastases may vary in size. Leptomeningeal carcinomatosis resulting from diffuse infiltration in the subarachnoid space also occurs in about 3% of patients with malignancy, usually from the lung, breast or gastric carcinomas. CSF analysis in metastatic disease shows low levels of glucose, increased protein concentration and pleiocytosis and, occasionally, the presence of tumour cells. Treatment of choice should be based on the clinical picture, but it often includes chemotherapy possibly in combination with whole-brain radiotherapy. The administration of corticosteroids might temporarily reduce the perilesional vasogenic oedema and hence relieve symptoms.

Brain metastases

Due to advances in the efficacy of systemic chemotherapy, there is an increase in the incidence of brain metastases as patients with metastatic cancer have an improved overall survival the last decades. Still, in most GI tumors, such as for example colon cancer, incidence of brain metastases remains low. The clinical features of brain metastases are very variable, but most patients develop symptoms related to increased intracranial pressure, such as headache in combination with nausea and vomiting. A smaller percentage (15%) of patients develops seizures or focal neurologic dysfunction. The manifestation of symptoms depends on the localization of the metastases. In rare cases patients present with stroke caused by a hemorrhage in metastases or embolization of tumor cells. For diagnosis, contrast-enhanced MRI is the preferred imaging study. Patients with signs of increased intracranial pressure should be treated with intravenous corticosteroids. Further treatment depends on the patients overall prognosis. In patients with limited extracranial disease and chemotherapeutic options, brain surgery and/or radiotherapy (whole brain or stereotactic) can be indicated. Systemic therapy is generally not adequate for brain metastases although the blood-brain barrier is not always impermeable as it is sometimes disrupted. Thus, in case of no other options and when the tumor is still chemosensitive, systemic therapy can be an option in those patients.

Some patients also develop leptomeningeal carcinomatosis, which can be confirmed by either imaging and/or evaluation of cerebrospinal fluid. The prognosis of these patients is very poor with a survival of only a few months. Sometimes intrathecal chemotherapy is given, although its superiority to systemic chemotherapy has never been established in clinical trials especially in patients with GI tumors and can therefore only be recommended in selected cases.

### Extensive metastatic leptomeningeal melanomatosis as the first clinical sign of a cutaneous melanoma: morphological correlations between magnetic resonance imaging and autopsy findings. A case report [^fa76daca]. Human Pathology (2003). Low credibility.

In recent years, the diagnosis and management of leptomeningeal carcinomatosis have gained increased attention as patients with neoplasms live longer and the condition becomes more common. Conclusive hallmarks of this disease have yet to be identified. We report and discuss a case of massive invasion of the cerebral leptomeninges by neoplastic cells from a malignant melanoma in a shoulder. Symptoms of cerebral dysfunction were the first indication of neoplasm. The onset of symptoms, magnetic resonance imaging, and patient death all occurred within a brief time span. To our knowledge, this is the first case of meningeal melanomatosis in a patient not treated with chemotherapeutic drugs in which the radiologic evidence is virtually synchronous with direct anatomic observation. Thus the images provided with this report may be of use in the radiographic diagnosis of cerebrospinal metastatic colonization.

Leptomeningeal metastases — risk status is categorized as good versus poor based on Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) and disease burden, with treatment referenced afterward. Good risk includes "KPS ≥ 60", no major neurologic deficits, minimal systemic disease, and reasonable systemic treatment options; poor risk includes "KPS < 60", multiple serious neurologic deficits, extensive systemic disease with few treatment options, bulky central nervous system (CNS) disease, and encephalopathy. The figure shows "Treatment (LEPT-2)" after the risk categorization. An accompanying note states: "Patients with tumors that are highly sensitive to systemic therapy or targeted therapy may be treated. Patients with a good risk status who do not desire further therapy may also be treated with palliative and/or best supportive care".

### Ocular symptoms secondary to meningeal carcinomatosis in a patient with lung adenocarcinoma: a case report [^e4e1115a]. BMC Ophthalmology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Meningeal carcinomatosis (MC) is a rare and severe complication of a number of neoplastic processes. Hematologic tumors are the most frequent cause of MC, particularly acute lymphoblastic leukemia and non-Hodking lymphoma. Among solid tumors, the most frequent causes of MC are breast and lung adenocarcinoma as well as melanoma. The incidence of this complication is around 3% in breast cancer, 7% in lung cancer and 1.5% in melanoma. MC is the first manifestation of systemic cancer in only 5–10% of patients, although it is frequently seen in patients with disseminated systemic disease.

MC occurs when tumor cells reach the leptomeningeal space either through the blood, the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or by growing along nerve and vascular sheaths. As a consequence, most patients present with different multifocal neurological symptoms that may involve the cranial nerves (oculomotor, facial, cochlear and optic), the spine and the cerebrum. Ocular symptoms were first reported by Katz, being diplopia and vision loss the most frequent ocular complaints.

Early diagnosis and treatment are usually very complicated. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is more sensitive than computed tomography (CT) scan in detecting brain meningeal dissemination, although the spine should also be assessed by MRI or CT myelography. MRI may show focal or diffuse leptomeningeal enhancement as well as tumoral lesions. However, these findings are non-specific, and should be evaluated in the particular clinical context. On the other hand, CSF analysis should be performed in all patients with suspected MC. Malignant cells are detected in the CSF in only 50% of patients with MC in the first lumbar puncture. Therefore, repeated CSF sampling is usually needed. Finally, the CSF protein concentration (50 mg/dl) and the opening CSF pressure (> 25 cm H2O) are frequently elevated, whereas the glucose concentration (< 60 mg/dl) is usually decreased.

### Prognostic validation and clinical implications of the EANO ESMO classification of leptomeningeal metastasis from solid tumors [^e54ea706]. Neuro-Oncology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The EANO ESMO guidelines have proposed a classification of leptomeningeal metastases (LM) from solid cancers based on clinical, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cytology presentation. MRI patterns are classified as linear, nodular, both, or neither. Type I LM is defined by positive CSF cytology (confirmed LM) whereas type II LM is defined by typical clinical and MRI signs (probable or possible LM). Here we explored the clinical utility of these LM subtypes.

Patients and Methods

We retrospectively assembled data from 254 patients with newly diagnosed LM from solid tumors. Survival curves were derived using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared by Log-rank test.

Results

Median age at LM diagnosis was 56 years. Typical clinical LM features were noted in 225 patients (89%); 13 patients (5%) were clinically asymptomatic. Tumor cells in the CSF were observed in 186 patients (73%) whereas the CSF was equivocal in 24 patients (9.5%) and negative in 44 patients (17.5%). Patients with confirmed LM had inferior outcome compared with patients with probable or possible LM (P = 0.006). Type I patients had inferior outcome than type II patients (P = 0.002). Nodular disease on MRI was a negative prognostic factor in type II LM (P = 0.014), but not in type I LM. Administration of either intrathecal pharmacotherapy (P = 0.020) or systemic pharmacotherapy (P = 0.0004) was associated with improved outcome in type I LM, but not in type II LM.

Conclusion

The EANO ESMO LM subtypes are highly prognostic and should be considered for stratification and overall design of clinical trials.

### The toxicity of intrathecal bevacizumab in a rabbit model of leptomeningeal carcinomatosis [^06b701ff]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2012). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Leptomeningeal carcinomatosis (LC) is a devastating complication of cancer. Intrathecal administration of cytotoxic chemotherapy adds little to survival which is measured in weeks. The potential toxicities and efficacy of intrathecally administered anti-angiogenic agents in this setting have not previously been explored. A well-characterized animal model was used to evaluate the neurotoxicity of intraventricularly administered bevacizumab (BCM). Thirty-three New Zealand White Rabbits were studied. Subcutaneous reservoirs and ventricular catheters (SRVC) were placed in eight rabbits, which were randomized to receive weekly intraventricular saline with or without BCM for four weeks. These rabbits were euthanized on day 36 and the brains were examined by a blinded neuropathologist. Twenty-five additional rabbits underwent cisternal injection of VX2 carcinoma cells with or without a single dose of BCM and were followed for survival. No clinical manifestations of neurotoxicity were noted in rabbits treated with intraventricular BCM. Similarly, no evidence of BCM neurotoxicity was identified in autopsied animals. The median survival of evaluable rabbits with LC treated with intraventricular saline (N = 13) was 15 days compared to 18 days for the animals receiving VX2 and one dose of BCM (N = 12).

Conclusion

Intraventricular BCM can be administered to rabbits without clinical or pathologic neurotoxicity. Survival following one dose of BCM in rabbits with LC should be cautiously interpreted given uncertainties regarding the dose, schedule, and limited expected benefit of this non-rabbit antibody. This neurotoxicity study provides safety data to allow phase I/II studies in humans with treatment refractory LC.
