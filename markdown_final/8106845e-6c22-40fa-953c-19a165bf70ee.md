## Question

How long plavix after bypass

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how long Plavix (clopidogrel) should be continued after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context driving post-CABG antiplatelet therapy. Then, I should verify what major guidelines recommend for duration of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) versus aspirin alone. Next, I will examine the strength and limitations of the evidence base, including randomized trials and meta-analyses. After that, I need to consider patient-specific modifiers such as ACS presentation, off-pump surgery, bleeding risk, and graft strategy. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk-stratified recommendation and confirm perioperative interruption and resumption details to ensure safety and completeness [^116U72JH] [^1119UekR].

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and baseline standard of care. After CABG, aspirin is the foundational antiplatelet therapy and should be initiated early postoperatively and continued indefinitely to reduce saphenous vein graft failure and adverse cardiovascular events, which anchors the discussion of whether and how long to add clopidogrel in selected patients [^115o4yiP] [^115Vaudj].

> Next, I should review guideline direction on adding a P2Y12 inhibitor after CABG. The ACC/AHA/SCAI guideline gives a Class IIb recommendation that DAPT with aspirin plus clopidogrel or ticagrelor for 1 year may be reasonable after CABG to improve vein graft patency, particularly in patients undergoing off-pump surgery or with higher SYNTAX burden, acknowledging observational and small randomized data rather than definitive large RCTs for hard outcomes [^115o4yiP] [^116VaaVG]. Hold on, I should verify the strength of evidence; yes, this is a 2b recommendation with B-R evidence, reflecting uncertainty and the need to individualize decisions [^115o4yiP].

> I will now examine the evidence base for DAPT duration. The CASCADE randomized trial tested aspirin plus clopidogrel versus aspirin alone for 1 year and did not show a significant reduction in intimal hyperplasia or graft patency at 1 year, though long-term follow-up suggested less native disease progression and a trend toward fewer events, which is hypothesis-generating rather than definitive for routine practice [^115J79Sb] [^113bYbSK]. Wait, let me verify consistency across studies; indeed, results are mixed, with some observational and small RCTs suggesting improved patency while others are neutral, underscoring the absence of a single large, definitive trial establishing hard-outcome benefit of routine DAPT after CABG [^112nQdM8] [^1127CGJp].

> But wait, what if the patient had an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) presentation or recent stenting before CABG? I need to ensure I align with ACS guidance. In ACS patients who undergo CABG, it is reasonable to resume and continue DAPT postoperatively to complete a 12-month course from the ACS event, given the established ischemic benefit of DAPT in ACS populations and the higher early thrombotic risk, even though the CABG-specific randomized evidence is limited [^116U72JH] [^111cJtWn]. Hold on, I should verify that this approach is consistent with broader ACS antiplatelet principles; yes, contemporary ACS guidance supports completing a 12-month DAPT course when bleeding risk is acceptable, with CABG-specific interruption and resumption strategies to balance bleeding and ischemia [^111cJtWn] [^116U72JH].

> Let me consider surgical technique and graft strategy, because this may influence DAPT decisions. Observational syntheses and guideline commentary suggest that the signal for improved vein graft patency with DAPT is stronger in off-pump CABG, whereas on-pump data are less consistent, so off-pump patients may be more appropriate candidates for a 12-month DAPT course when bleeding risk is low to moderate [^115o4yiP] [^112nQdM8]. I should double-check that this nuance is reflected in the guidance; yes, the ACC/AHA/SCAI document highlights off-pump subsets and higher SYNTAX burden as contexts where DAPT may be reasonable [^115o4yiP].

> I need to ensure I address bleeding risk, because this is the key counterbalance to ischemic benefit. Meta-analyses indicate that DAPT after CABG reduces MACCE and mortality at the cost of more major and minor bleeding compared with aspirin alone, so duration should be shortened or avoided in patients with elevated bleeding risk, recent major bleeding, or high bleeding scores, with careful postoperative monitoring if DAPT is used [^114193ST]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; the absolute bleeding risk varies by agent and patient factors, so individualized risk stratification is essential before committing to 12 months of DAPT [^114193ST].

> Let me synthesize a practical, risk-stratified answer. For most patients with stable CAD undergoing elective CABG, aspirin monotherapy indefinitely is the default, and DAPT is not routinely required; if DAPT is considered, a 12-month course of aspirin plus clopidogrel is a reasonable, evidence-informed option in selected higher-risk scenarios such as off-pump surgery, complex anatomy, or when a vein-graft patency benefit is prioritized and bleeding risk is acceptable, recognizing the evidence is modest and mixed [^115o4yiP] [^112nQdM8]. For patients presenting with ACS or recent stenting who require CABG, completing a 12-month DAPT course postoperatively is reasonable unless bleeding risk is prohibitive, with interruption and resumption timed around surgery to mitigate bleeding [^115mmRwp] [^116U72JH].

> I should confirm perioperative interruption and resumption details to avoid bleeding complications. Elective CABG: stop clopidogrel 5 days preoperatively when feasible; urgent CABG: hold at least 24 hours if possible, recognizing that proceeding earlier increases bleeding risk and may require blood conservation strategies; resume aspirin within 24 hours postoperatively when bleeding risk allows, and add clopidogrel within 24–72 hours once hemostasis is secure and chest tube output is acceptable [^116U72JH] [^115Vaudj] [^1119UekR]. Wait, I should verify that contemporary guidance aligns with this approach; yes, ACC/AHA/SCAI and CHEST recommendations support these interruption intervals and early resumption timelines tailored to bleeding risk [^116U72JH] [^1119UekR].

> Next, I should review alternatives and special situations. If DAPT is contraindicated or bleeding risk is high, aspirin monotherapy remains the standard; if aspirin is not tolerated, clopidogrel monotherapy is a reasonable alternative for secondary prevention, though this is less well studied specifically in the CABG population and should be individualized [^114ekpGh]. Hold on, I should verify that this fallback is consistent with guideline language; yes, CHEST guidance supports single antiplatelet therapy with aspirin or clopidogrel long term after CABG when dual therapy is not suitable [^114ekpGh].

> In summary, I need to ensure the final recommendation is precise and risk-based. For stable CAD without ACS, continue aspirin indefinitely; consider DAPT with aspirin plus clopidogrel for 12 months in selected patients to potentially improve vein graft patency, especially off-pump or complex anatomy, balancing bleeding risk. For ACS or recent stenting requiring CABG, complete a 12-month DAPT course postoperatively when bleeding risk permits, with guideline-directed interruption and early resumption around surgery. The optimal duration remains an area of evolving evidence, so reassess at 6–12 months and de-escalate to aspirin alone if bleeding risk rises or ischemic risk falls [^115o4yiP] [^112nQdM8] [^116U72JH].

---

Plavix (clopidogrel) is **not routinely continued long-term after CABG**; standard practice is lifelong aspirin [^115o4yiP] with clopidogrel added only for specific indications (e.g. recent ACS, prior PCI with stent, or off-pump CABG) [^112nQdM8] and typically for 1–12 months depending on risk and context [^111cJtWn]. For elective CABG, stop clopidogrel **5 days pre-op** [^1119UekR] to reduce bleeding; for urgent cases, hold at least 24 hours if possible [^116U72JH]. Resume clopidogrel post-op when bleeding risk is acceptable, usually within 24–72 hours [^116U72JH], and continue only if there is a clear indication. Routine long-term clopidogrel after CABG is not supported by evidence and increases bleeding risk [^112oAawZ].

---

## Indications for clopidogrel use after CABG

Clopidogrel is **not routinely prescribed long-term after CABG**; it is reserved for specific clinical scenarios:

- **Recent acute coronary syndrome (ACS)**: Patients who presented with ACS (NSTEMI or STEMI) and underwent CABG may benefit from DAPT (aspirin plus clopidogrel) for 1–12 months, depending on individual risk assessment and clinical judgment [^113Xyp2b] [^112nQdM8].

- **Prior PCI with stent placement**: Patients who underwent PCI with stent placement before CABG may require DAPT to prevent stent thrombosis, typically for 1–12 months, depending on the type of stent and timing of surgery [^115mmRwp] [^113Xyp2b].

- **Off-pump CABG**: Some guidelines suggest that DAPT may be beneficial after off-pump CABG to improve vein graft patency, although evidence is limited and mixed [^115o4yiP] [^112nQdM8].

---

## Duration of clopidogrel therapy after CABG

The duration of clopidogrel therapy after CABG **varies** based on the clinical indication and individual patient risk:

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended duration of clopidogrel therapy** |
|-|-|
| Recent ACS (NSTEMI/STEMI) | 1–12 months (individualized) |
| Prior PCI with stent placement | 1–12 months (depending on stent type and timing) |
| Off-pump CABG | 1–12 months (considered in select patients) |
| Stable CAD without recent ACS or PCI | Not routinely recommended |

---

## Evidence supporting clopidogrel use after CABG

Evidence supporting routine clopidogrel use after CABG is **limited and mixed**:

- **CASCADE trial**: The addition of clopidogrel to aspirin did not significantly reduce intimal hyperplasia or improve graft patency at 1 year, although a trend toward reduced native disease progression was observed [^115J79Sb] [^113bYbSK].

- **ROOBY trial**: Post-CABG clopidogrel use did not significantly improve 1-year graft patency rates compared to aspirin alone [^11117LFK].

- **Meta-analyses**: Some meta-analyses suggest potential benefits of DAPT in reducing saphenous vein graft failure, particularly in off-pump CABG, but the overall evidence remains inconclusive and heterogeneous [^112nQdM8] [^1127CGJp].

---

## Risks associated with clopidogrel use after CABG

Clopidogrel use after CABG is associated with **increased bleeding risk**, including:

- **Increased bleeding**: Clopidogrel significantly increases the risk of major bleeding, reoperation for bleeding, and blood transfusion requirements, particularly when continued within 5 days of surgery [^115sJf32] [^111myUQu].

- **Longer hospital stay**: Patients receiving clopidogrel may experience prolonged hospitalization and increased healthcare costs due to bleeding complications [^113VVNHc].

- **Stroke risk**: Some studies have reported an increased risk of stroke associated with clopidogrel use after CABG, although findings are inconsistent [^113RVym1].

---

## Current guideline recommendations

Current guidelines emphasize **individualized decision-making** regarding clopidogrel use after CABG:

- **Aspirin therapy**: Aspirin (75–325 mg daily) is recommended indefinitely after CABG to reduce graft failure and adverse cardiovascular events [^115o4yiP].

- **DAPT consideration**: DAPT with aspirin and clopidogrel may be considered in selected patients at high risk of ischemic events, such as those with recent ACS, prior PCI with stent, or off-pump CABG, but the evidence is limited and individualized risk-benefit assessment is essential [^115o4yiP] [^112nQdM8].

- **Bleeding risk assessment**: Clinicians should carefully assess bleeding risk and monitor patients closely when prescribing clopidogrel after CABG [^115KfG3Q].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Routine use**: Clopidogrel is not routinely recommended for long-term use after CABG.

- **Selected patients**: Clopidogrel may be considered for selected patients at high ischemic risk, such as those with recent ACS, prior PCI with stent, or off-pump CABG, typically for 1–12 months.

- **Individualized decision-making**: The decision to use clopidogrel after CABG should be individualized, balancing ischemic benefits against bleeding risks, and guided by current clinical evidence and patient-specific factors [^115KfG3Q].

### Clopidogrel bisulfate (Plavix) [^113WMtxj]. FDA (2012). Low credibility.

Most of the benefit of Plavix occurred in the first two months, but the difference from placebo was maintained throughout the course of the trial (up to 12 months) (see Figure 2).

In CURE, the use of Plavix was associated with a lower incidence of CV death, MI or stroke in patient populations with different characteristics, as shown in Figure 3. The benefits associated with Plavix were independent of the use of other acute and long-term cardiovascular therapies, including heparin/LMWH, intravenous glycoprotein IIb/IIIa (GPIIb/IIIa) inhibitors, lipid-lowering drugs, beta-blockers, and ACE-inhibitors. The efficacy of Plavix was observed independently of the dose of aspirin (75–325 mg once daily). The use of oral anticoagulants, non-study antiplatelet drugs, and chronic NSAIDs was not allowed in CURE.

The use of Plavix in CURE was associated with a decrease in the use of thrombolytic therapy (71 patients [1.1%] in the Plavix group, 126 patients [2.0%] in the placebo group; relative risk reduction of 43%), and GPIIb/IIIa inhibitors (369 patients [5.9%] in the Plavix group, 454 patients [7.2%] in the placebo group, relative risk reduction of 18%). The use of Plavix in CURE did not affect the number of patients treated with CABG or PCI (with or without stenting), (2253 patients [36.0%] in the Plavix group, 2324 patients [36.9%] in the placebo group; relative risk reduction of 4.0%).

5.1 Diminished Antiplatelet Activity Due to Impaired CYP2C19 Function

Clopidogrel is a prodrug. Inhibition of platelet aggregation by clopidogrel is achieved through an active metabolite. The metabolism of clopidogrel to its active metabolite can be impaired by genetic variations in CYP2C19 [see Boxed Warning] and by concomitant medications that interfere with CYP2C19.

Proton Pump Inhibitors

Avoid concomitant use of Plavix with omeprazole or esomeprazole because both significantly reduce the antiplatelet activity of Plavix [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

5.2	 General Risk of Bleeding

Thienopyridines, including Plavix, increase the risk of bleeding. If a patient is to undergo surgery and an antiplatelet effect is not desired, discontinue Plavix five days prior to surgery. In patients who stopped therapy more than five days prior to CABG the rates of major bleeding were similar (event rate 4.4% Plavix + aspirin; 5.3% placebo + aspirin). In patients who remained on therapy within five days of CABG, the major bleeding rate was 9.6% for Plavix + aspirin, and 6.3% for placebo + aspirin.

Thienopyridines inhibit platelet aggregation for the lifetime of the platelet (7–10 days), so withholding a dose will not be useful in managing a bleeding event or the risk of bleeding associated with an invasive procedure. Because the half-life of clopidogrel's active metabolite is short, it may be possible to restore hemostasis by administering exogenous platelets; however, platelet transfusions within 4 hours of the loading dose or 2 hours of the maintenance dose may be less effective.

5.3 Discontinuation of Plavix

Avoid lapses in therapy, and if Plavix must be temporarily discontinued, restart as soon as possible. Premature discontinuation of Plavix may increase the risk of cardiovascular events.

5.4 Patients with Recent Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA) or Stroke

In patients with recent TIA or stroke who are at high risk for recurrent ischemic events, the combination of aspirin and Plavix has not been shown to be more effective than Plavix alone, but the combination has been shown to increase major bleeding.

### Should clopidogrel be discontinued before coronary artery bypass grafting for patients with acute coronary syndrome? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^111myUQu]. The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

Patients presenting with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) are treated with dual antiplatelet agents, including aspirin and clopidogrel, to prevent mortality and recurrent ischemia. However, those who require coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) could have increased postoperative bleeding and bleeding-related adverse outcomes. The current guidelines on clinical management differ significantly. The present meta-analysis examined the evidence for clopidogrel in the treatment of patients presenting with ACS requiring CABG, with a focus on the timing of medication cessation before surgery.

Methods

A systematic review of 9 electronic databases was performed to identify all relevant studies with comparable outcomes for patients with ACS treated with clopidogrel before CABG. The endpoints included reoperation, major bleeding, mortality, and a composite endpoint of mortality and recurrent myocardial infarction.

Results

Five relevant studies were identified according to the predefined selection criteria. Patients who had received clopidogrel had a significantly lower incidence of composite endpoints than those who had not. However, patients who underwent CABG < 5 days after the last dose of clopidogrel had a significantly greater incidence of reoperation, major bleeding, and combined adverse outcomes than those who had had a washout period > 5 days.

Conclusions

The results from the present meta-analysis suggest that patients who present with ACS should be treated with dual antiplatelet therapy, including clopidogrel. However, for patients subsequently referred for CABG, a minimum washout period of 5 days should be observed to minimize perioperative bleeding and bleeding-related complications, unless emergency indications exist. These results differ from those of previous studies and guidelines.

### Clopidogrel bisulfate [^116aBMxy]. FDA. Low credibility.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of clopidogrel bisulfate PO (also known as Plavix):

- Bleeding: use caution in patients taking other drugs increasing the risk of bleeding, including anticoagulants, antiplatelets, and long-term NSAIDs. Discontinue clopidogrel 5 days before elective surgeries with a major risk of bleeding.
- Cardiovascular events: use caution when discontinuing clopidogrel. Restart clopidogrel as soon as possible if temporarily discontinued.
- Drug hypersensitivity reaction: use caution in patients with hypersensitivity to other thienopyridines.
- TTP: maintain a high level of suspicion, as an increased incidence has been reported in patients receiving clopidogrel.

### Does clopidogrel increase blood loss following coronary artery bypass surgery? [^113VVNHc]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Clopidogrel (Plavix) is a potent inhibitor of platelet aggregation used concomitantly with percutaneous coronary interventions and in patients with acute coronary syndromes. Its favorable effects on preventing thrombus formation may have deleterious effects on hemostasis in patients undergoing coronary surgery.

Methods

Data were collected prospectively on 312 consecutive urgent or emergent coronary artery bypass patients from July 1999 through April 2001 at a tertiary care center. Patients were stratified into three groups: clopidogrel within 4 days of operation (n = 41), clopidogrel continued until 5 to 8 days before operation (n = 39), and clopidogrel discontinued more than 8 days before operation or were never taking clopidogrel (n = 232).

Results

Preoperative and intraoperative characteristics were similar among all groups. Mediastinal and pericardial chest tube losses in the first 24 hours were 1,044 ± 750 mL in the clopidogrel within 4 days group, 528 ± 250 mL in the clopidogrel 5 to 8 days group, and 573 ± 329 mL in the clopidogrel more than 8 days group (p < 0.01). The mean total blood product transfusions were 12.2 ± 15.4 U, 1.2 ± 2.0 U, and 2.6 ± 5.7 U, respectively (p < 0.001). Reoperation for bleeding was noted in 14.6%, 2.6%, and 1.7%, respectively (p = 0.002). The median hospital lengths of stay for the three groups were 9 days, 7 days, and 7 days, respectively (p = 0.018). There were no statistically significant differences in mortality rate, myocardial infarction, stroke, mediastinitis, or postoperative renal failure among the groups. Multivariable analysis revealed that clopidogrel within 0 to 4 days of operation was an independent predictor of transfusion requirements (OR 4.22, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.07, 9.34, p = 0.001), intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay (OR 3.14, 95% CI 1.40, 7.04, p = 0.006), and total hospital length of stay (coefficient 7.65, se 2.41, p = 0.002).

Conclusions

Clopidogrel within 4 days of coronary bypass surgery is associated with increased blood losses and reoperation for bleeding and, according to multivariable models, is an independent risk factor for increased transfusion requirements and prolonged ICU and hospital length of stay.

### Clopidogrel (Plavix) [^111hJ4st]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Most of the benefit of Plavix occurred in the first two months, but the difference from placebo was maintained throughout the course of the trial (up to 12 months) (see Figure 2).

Figure 2: Cardiovascular Death, Myocardial Infarction, and Stroke in the CURE Study

The effect of Plavix did not differ significantly in various subgroups, as shown in Figure 3. The benefits associated with Plavix were independent of the use of other acute and long-term cardiovascular therapies, including heparin/LMWH, intravenous glycoprotein IIb/IIIa (GPIIb/IIIa) inhibitors, lipid-lowering drugs, beta-blockers, and ACE inhibitors. The efficacy of Plavix was observed independently of the dose of aspirin (75–325 mg once daily). The use of oral anticoagulants, nonstudy antiplatelet drugs, and chronic NSAIDs was not allowed in CURE.

Figure 3: Hazard Ratio for Patient Baseline Characteristics and On-Study Concomitant Medications/Interventions for the CURE Study

The use of Plavix in CURE was associated with a decrease in the use of thrombolytic therapy (71 patients [1.1%] in the Plavix group, 126 patients [2.0%] in the placebo group; relative risk reduction of 43%), and GPIIb/IIIa inhibitors (369 patients [5.9%] in the Plavix group, 454 patients [7.2%] in the placebo group, relative risk reduction of 18%). The use of Plavix in CURE did not affect the number of patients treated with CABG or PCI (with or without stenting) (2253 patients [36.0%] in the Plavix group, 2324 patients [36.9%] in the placebo group; relative risk reduction of 4.0%).

Antiplatelet therapy recommendations for established coronary artery disease (CAD), including patients after the first year post–acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and/or with prior coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), state the following: We recommend long-term single antiplatelet therapy with aspirin 75 to 100 mg daily or clopidogrel 75 mg daily over no antiplatelet therapy (Grade 1A). We suggest single over dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin plus clopidogrel (Grade 2B).

Coronary artery bypass grafting-related risk on Clopidogrel

Clopidogrel is a second-generation thienopyridine characterized by a large interindividual variability in pharmacodynamic response that has a significanct impact on clinical outcomes. This is because clopidogrel is a prodrug that requires biotransformation into its active metabolite. Polymorphisms in genes encoding the cytochrome P450 (CYP) system, especially CYP2C19, are key players and clopidogrel-treated PCI patients who carry genetic variants associated with CYP2C19 loss-of-function have a three- to six-fold higher risk of stent thrombosis. However, polymorphic variation in CYP2C19 explains < 20% of the response variability with clopidogrel, leaving variation in bioactivation of clopidogrel largely unexplained. So far, there is no convincing evidence that genetic testing or functional platelet assays that measure platelet reactivity may improve clinical outcomes in clopidogrel-treated patients undergoing PCI.

Observational studies

Observational studies have demonstated that the increase in postoperative chest tube drainage, transfusion, reoperation rates, hospitalization stay, and mortality observed when DAPT (aspirin and clopidogrel) is maintained during CABG – is blunted when DAPT is stopped 5 days or more prior to CABG. Shorter windows of clopidogrel interruption have been suggested but time delay alone does not solely account for the difference in the observed magnitude of clopidogrel effect on bleeding. Differences in patient response to P2Y 12 inhibitors, outcome definitions, transfusion triggers, use of antifibrinolytics, and surgeon-related factors may have been sources of bias. Few studies have reported on ischaemic event rates in ACS patients waiting for CABG. In the CURE trial, patients exposed to clopidogrel had a non-significantly lower MACE rate than the placebo group (2.9 vs. 4.7, 1.8% ARR, RR: 0.56, 95% CI: 0.29–1.08). Overall, current evidence suggests that clopidogrel should be stopped 5 or more days prior to CABG to avoid bleeding complications that may increase perioperative mortality except if there is uncontrolled ischaemia (Table 1).

Meta-analysis data

Higher blood loss, transfusion, and reoperation rates associated with pre-CABG clopidogrel exposure < 5 days have been confirmed by five meta-analyses. Mortality is increased in observational studies except in patients with ACS, although patient status (stable vs. ACS), type of surgery (urgent vs. elective), and the absence of appropriate study matching may confound the effect of recent clopidogrel exposure (Table 2). Importantly, discontinuation of clopidogrel for 5–7 days before operation does not seem to confer increased cardiac risk.

### Dual antiplatelet therapy after coronary artery bypass grafting in the setting of acute coronary syndrome [^115vUfJb]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

After acute coronary syndrome (ACS), dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) is the standard of care for both invasive management with percutaneous intervention and noninvasive (medical) management. Conversely, studies using dual antiplatelet in the population of patients presenting with ACS who undergo coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) are conflicting. The appropriate antiplatelet regimen after CABG remains an area of controversy. Plaque stability, prevention of graft closure, and secondary thrombosis form the basis for using a second antiplatelet drug, whereas the additional risk of bleeding and lack of conclusive evidence should also be considered. After an extensive literature search, 12 clinical trials with efficacy outcomes were identified. Most of the studies are retrospective, nonrandomized single-center trials. A few large patient populations have been examined using database information. To date, there is only 1 prospective, multicenter, randomized trial published. Recommendations from national guidelines differ, proposing single antiplatelet therapy with aspirin or DAPT with the combination of aspirin and clopidogrel. The purpose of this report is to review the available clinical trial data and provide guidance to practitioners when caring for this patient population. In conclusion, there is no clear consensus regarding the use of DAPT in patients after CABG. If not contraindicated, it is reasonable to use DAPT, starting in the postoperative period, in patients presenting with ACS. Large, multicenter, randomized clinical trials are needed to definitively investigate the role of DAPT in patients with ACS after CABG.

### Comparison of long-term usefulness of clopidogrel therapy after the first percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary artery bypass grafting versus that after the second or repeat intervention [^115XJuDq]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2004). Low credibility.

Patients in the Clopidogrel for the Reduction of Events During Observation trial were subgrouped according to whether they underwent index percutaneous coronary artery revascularization procedures only or this procedure plus subsequent percutaneous or surgical revascularization procedures during 1-year follow-up. The relative risk reduction in ischemic events associated with up-front and long-term clopidogrel compared with placebo was 2-fold greater in patients who required repeat revascularization procedures compared with those who did not (42.4% vs 21.7%).

Postoperative management of antiplatelet therapy

Single antiplatelet therapy

Early thrombosis is the major cause of vein graft attrition during the first month after CABG, with occlusion rates of between 5 and 26% at 1 year, and ASA has been shown to improve 1-year vein graft patency. – The role of ASA in graft patency becomes substantial when initiated prior to CABG and then restarted ∼6 h after surgery. The beneficial effect of ASA on vein graft patency appears attenuated after the first year due to lack of effect on intimal hyperplasia and vein graft atherosclerosis. Although there is no evidence for an effect of ASA on long-term internal mammary artery graft patency, it should be continued indefinitely after CABG given its benefit in preventing subsequent clinical events (Table 4). Medium doses of ASA (300–325 mg daily) have not been shown to be more effective than low doses (75–160 mg daily) in preventing graft occlusion and adverse clinical events, although an indirect meta-analysis provided weak evidence that medium doses might be more effective. Inhibition of platelet function by ASA may be impaired after CABG, with or without CPB, in one-third of patients, due to reduced absorption, drug interactions, systemic inflammation, and increased platelet turnover, and these factors may increase the risk of graft occlusion early after CABG. This phenomenon is transient and may be addressed by early intravenous or rectal administration followed by oral twice-daily administration early postoperatively. In case of ASA intolerance, clopidogrel is indicated for prevention of ischaemic events.

### Safety of clopidogrel being continued until the time of coronary artery bypass grafting in patients with acute coronary syndrome: a meta-analysis of 34 studies [^116cFqEn]. European Heart Journal (2011). Low credibility.

AIMS Guidelines suggest that patients should discontinue clopidogrel for 5 days prior to coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) where possible. Those with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) are at elevated risk of further myocardial infarction (MI) and death without clopidogrel. This meta-analysis aims to determine the risk of CABG in ACS patients while continuing clopidogrel. METHOD AND RESULTS Thirty-four studies with 22 584 patients undergoing CABG were assessed. Patients with recent clopidogrel exposure (CL) were compared with those without recent clopidogrel (NC). Although mortality is increased in CL vs. NC [odds ratio (OR) 1.6, 95% CI 1.30–1.96, P < 0.00001], it is influenced by the ACS status and case urgency in these mainly non-randomized studies. In ACS patients, there is no significant difference in mortality (OR 1.44, 95% CI 0.97–2.1, P = 0.07) or in postoperative MI (OR 0.57, 95% CI 0.31–1.07, P = 0.08) and stroke rates (OR 1.23, 95% CI 0.66–2.29, P = 0.52). Combined major adverse cardiovascular event (stroke, MI, and death) was not different in the two groups (OR 1.10, 95% CI 0.87–1.41, P = 0.43). Reoperation rates are elevated on clopidogrel but have reduced over time, and were specifically not different in ACS patients (OR 1.5, 95% CI 0.88–2.54, P = 0.13). CONCLUSION Previous studies focused on surrogate endpoints and compared higher risk ACS patients with elective cases. However, many patients have safely undergone CABG on clopidogrel and surgical expertise is growing. Multinational trials are required to fully determine the balance of ischaemia and bleeding. While results are awaited we suggest ACS patients requiring urgent CABG proceed with surgery without delay for a clopidogrel-free period.

### Balancing the benefit and risk of oral antiplatelet agents in coronary artery bypass surgery [^111j428c]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

Concern about possible hemorrhagic complications arising from use of oral antiplatelet agents in immediate proximity to coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery leads many clinicians to avoid or discontinue these agents preoperatively. Recent evidence suggests that aspirin and clopidogrel can be used with relative safety in the preoperative period; dual antiplatelet therapy in the 5 days immediately preceding CABG surgery results in a moderate and variable increase in the risk of procedural bleeding. This modest hemorrhagic risk may be acceptable, given the clinical benefits of sustained antiplatelet therapy in preventing graft occlusion and ischemic complications pre- and post-CABG. Because the bleeding risk with aspirin is dose dependent, use of a low dose is preferred post-CABG.

### Platelet-directed therapies and coronary artery bypass grafting [^111uxaeM]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2009). Low credibility.

Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is effective in reducing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in certain high-risk groups. Despite improvement in surgical technique, hemorrhagic complications are a major concern and are likely to affect perioperative morbidity and mortality, length of stay, and hospital expenditures. The use of platelet-directed therapies in this setting is effective in decreasing ischemic complications, yet these agents simultaneously increase the risk of bleeding. Concern about potential hemorrhagic risk from antiplatelet agents in proximity to CABG may influence physicians to discontinue these agents. The benefit of low-dose aspirin given preoperatively is likely to outweigh any hemorrhagic risk. Dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel (or aspirin and prasugrel) is associated with a significant increased risk of bleeding and its complications. Additional research is needed to properly evaluate the ischemic benefit versus bleeding risk of aspirin and clopidogrel. Whether reversible P2Y(12) receptor antagonists will mitigate the bleeding risk is unclear at the present time and will require large prospective studies.

CABG surgery — clopidogrel interruption interval and bleeding outcomes: A meta-analysis of four randomized trials and one observational study totaling 2,632 patients undergoing CABG surgery that compared > 5 days vs ≤ 5 days interruption of clopidogrel found patients with a longer interruption had a lower incidence of re-operation (1.8% vs 3.2%; OR = 0.47; 95% CI: 0.25–0.91) and major bleeding (19.7% vs 30.2%; OR = 0.71; 95% CI: 0.51–0.98) and cardiovascular events; subanalyses in acute coronary syndromes reported a 50% higher risk for major bleeding and a 70% higher need for transfusion requirements when clopidogrel was given within 5 days before CABG, and observational studies found increased bleeding when clopidogrel was given within 5 days of CABG; in a PLATO subanalysis, rates of bleeding were similar for stopping clopidogrel 7 days vs stopping ticagrelor 24 to 72 hours preoperatively.

### Use of aspirin and clopidogrel after coronary artery bypass graft surgery [^112oAawZ]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the evidence for the use of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with aspirin and clopidogrel following coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery.

Data Sources

Literature was accessed through PubMed (1950-November 2011), EMBASE (1976-November 2011), and the Cochrane databases using the terms clopidogrel and coronary artery bypass graft. Citations from available articles were used for additional references and ClinicalTrials.gov was accessed for abstracts of ongoing studies.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Peer-reviewed studies that evaluated DAPT use after CABG surgery in adult humans were assessed for inclusion.

Data Synthesis

Four randomized clinical trials evaluating surrogate end points and 9 studies (3 subgroup analyses, 6 observational) evaluating clinical outcomes were reviewed. Three clinical trials assessing surrogate end points failed to demonstrate an improvement in graft patency with DAPT use, while 1 clinical trial found an increase in graft patency. As for clinical outcomes, 1 subgroup analysis demonstrated that the benefit of DAPT post-CABG after a non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome diminished following surgery, while an observational study demonstrated a trend toward decreased mortality. In post-CABG patients who did not experience acute coronary syndrome, 2 subgroup analyses proved inconclusive and an observational study found DAPT use to be associated with reducing in-hospital mortality, while another observational study was not associated with reduced long-term mortality. Three observational studies in off-pump CABG patients showed that DAPT use was feasible.

Conclusions

Evidence for DAPT use following CABG is limited to subgroup analyses, observational studies, and trials with surrogate end points. The majority of clinical trials have failed to demonstrate an improvement in graft patency with DAPT. Current evidence does not support the use of DAPT to improve graft patency, and more evidence from randomized controlled trials assessing clinical outcomes is necessary to make definitive recommendations.

On the other hand, a meta-analysis of 34 studies including 22,584 patients showed increased mortality and post-operative bleeding among Clopidogrel-exposed patients who underwent CABG; nevertheless, authors recommended that high-risk ACS patients should proceed with CABG without delay for a Copidogrel-free period. Another meta-analysis of 6,385 ACS patients who required CABG showed that exposure to Clopidogrel within 5 days prior to CABG was associated with increased major bleeding and reoperation, although it showed significantly lower incidence of mortality and ischemic adverse events. The authors suggested that ACS patients, who were subsequently referred for CABG, should wait for a minimum of 5 days washout period to prevent bleeding and reoperation. Another study conducted by Nurozler et al. showed increased bleeding rate and re-exploration for bleeding in patients exposed to Clopidogrel within a week of CABG. The duration of mechanical ventilation and length of stay were also longer compared to control group among those patients. Miceli et al. showed that Clopidogrel within 5 days in combination with aspirin within 2 days of CABG was associated with an increased risk of postoperative myocardial infarction, bleeding and reoperation for bleeding. Likewise, other retrospective case control studies showed that patients who underwent CABG shortly after Clopidogrel exposure had increased risk of re-exploration for bleeding, and bleeding risk was significantly higher when Aspirin and Clopidogrel were continued up to 2 days prior to surgery.

Dual antiplatet therapy after Coronary artery bypass grafting surgery

Observational studies have demonstrated the safety of early postoperative clopidogrel use following CABG but a meta-analysis of studies reporting on safety/efficacy of clopidogrel use with or without aspirin did not show a clear clinical benefit of clopidogrel when given in addition to aspirin after CABG. Several randomized trials have compared the effect of DAPT vs. aspirin on graft patency with diverging results. – Two meta-analyses of observational studies and RCTs showed that the use of DAPT reduced early vein graft occlusion. The meta-analysis by Deo et al. also showed, in the ASA-clopidogrel group, a decrease in hospital or 30-day mortality (0.8 vs. 1.9%, P < 0.0001) compared with ASA alone and this effect was more pronounced in off-pump patients.

The effects of prasugrel have not yet been studied following CABG surgery but the mortality data from TRITON is supportive of resuming prasugrel following CABG surgery (adj OR: 0.26; 95% CI: 0.08–0.85; P = 0.025). In the PLATO study, it was intended that study medication with ticagrelor or clopidogrel should be started as soon as possible after CABG surgery and prior to hospital discharge. Thirty-six percent of CABG patients in the study restarted study medication within 7 days of surgery, 37% did not restart study medication and the rest restarted study medication 7 or more days later. Postoperative mortality was lower in the ticagrelor group compared with the clopidogrel group (HR: 0.49; 95% CI: 0.32–0.77). It is uncertain how much of the benefit of ticagrelor compared with clopidogrel related to preoperative compared with postoperative treatment and further studies will provide more evidence in this area.

Conclusions

Antiplatelet therapy plays a major role in the treatment of CAD and is therefore implicated throughout the CABG pathway. Management of single and DAPT in patients undergoing CABG for ACS, previous PCI, or stable angina impacts on early and late outcomes. Risk stratification for bleeding and recurrent ischaemic events, heart team decision making for temporary interruption of antiplatelet therapy and bridging strategies, the use of platelet function monitoring, and blood sparing management strategies are the key steps to further improve clinical outcome in patients undergoing CABG surgery. Gaps in knowledge remain, especially with respect to identification of the optimal bleeding-thrombotic risk balance before and after surgery. Specific studies for patients undergoing CABG are mandatory.

### Expert position paper on the management of antiplatelet therapy in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery [^117LJEiP]. European Heart Journal (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG)-related bleeding complications and perioperative coronary events are strongly influenced by the management of antithrombotic therapy before and after CABG. Bleeding but also blood products transfusion increase the risk of death and compromise the long-term benefits of CABG. The use of new P2Y 12 inhibitors, increasing pre-CABG percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI) with drug eluting stents (DES) requiring specific antiplatelet regimens, and advances in surgical technique has prompted the ESC Working Group on Cardiovascular Surgery and the ESC Working Group on Thrombosis to review the evidence of peri-CABG recommendations on antithrombotic management. Due to the paucity of randomized trials, most of the evidence is still derived from observational studies and expert consensus, further reinforcing the importance of a multidisciplinary consultation for optimal decision making.

### Clopidogrel use and bleeding after coronary artery bypass graft surgery [^114gGbAY]. American Heart Journal (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Short-term use of clopidogrel plus aspirin among patients with acute coronary syndrome reduces ischemic events, but concerns about coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery-related bleeding limit its early use.

Methods

Using data from 4,794 consecutive CABG procedures in the Duke Databank for Cardiovascular Disease (January 1999 to December 2003), we developed multivariable models for associations with CABG-related bleeding defined as reoperation for bleeding, red cell transfusion, and a composite of reoperation/transfusion/hematocrit drop ≥ 15%. We examined clopidogrel use ≤ 5 days versus no clopidogrel ≤ 5 days before CABG in each model. Models were adjusted for propensity for clopidogrel use ≤ 5 days.

Results

Of 4,794 CABG patients, 332 (6.9%) received clopidogrel ≤ 5 days before CABG, 127 (2.6%) had reoperation for bleeding, 3,277 (68.4%) received red cell transfusion, and 4,387 (91.5%) had the composite outcome. After adjustment, clopidogrel use ≤ 5 days was not significantly associated with reoperation (odds ratio [OR] 1.24, 95% CI 0.63–2.41) or the composite end point (OR 1.23, 95% CI 0.72–2.10). Clopidogrel ≤ 5 days was modestly associated with red cell transfusion (OR 1.40, 95% CI 1.04–1.89) but more weakly than other factors, including which surgeon performed the procedure.

Conclusion

Clopidogrel administration ≤ 5 days before CABG was not significantly associated with reoperation for bleeding or a bleeding composite, and only weakly with red cell transfusion after surgery. The impact of withholding clopidogrel acutely in those for whom clopidogrel has proven benefits and the impact of delaying CABG to prevent bleeding among patients treated with clopidogrel should be viewed in the context of other stronger determinants of bleeding.

1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Plavix is a P2Y12platelet inhibitor indicated for:

Acute coronary syndrome
For patients with non-ST-segment elevation ACS [unstable angina (UA)/non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI)] including patients who are to be managed medically and those who are to be managed with coronary revascularization, Plavix has been shown to decrease the rate of a combined endpoint of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction (MI), or stroke as well as the rate of a combined endpoint of cardiovascular death, MI, stroke, or refractory ischemia. (1.1)
For patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), Plavix has been shown to reduce the rate of death from any cause and the rate of a combined endpoint of death, re-infarction, or stroke. The benefit for patients who undergo primary PCI is unknown. (1.1)
Recent myocardial infarction (MI), recent stroke, or established peripheral arterial disease. Plavix has been shown to reduce the combined endpoint of new ischemic stroke (fatal or not), new MI (fatal or not), and other vascular death. (1.2)

1.1 Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS)

For patients with non-ST-segment elevation ACS [unstable angina (UA)/non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI)], including patients who are to be managed medically and those who are to be managed with coronary revascularization, Plavix has been shown to decrease the rate of a combined endpoint of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction (MI), or stroke as well as the rate of a combined endpoint of cardiovascular death, MI, stroke, or refractory ischemia.
For patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), Plavix has been shown to reduce the rate of death from any cause and the rate of a combined endpoint of death, re-infarction, or stroke. The benefit for patients who undergo primary percutaneous coronary intervention is unknown.

### Early clopidogrel use in non-ST elevation acute coronary syndrome and subsequent coronary artery bypass grafting [^112hTaqb]. American Heart Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Clopidogrel use is associated with a significant decrease in major adverse cardiac events when used in patients with non-ST elevation acute coronary syndromes (NSTE-ACS), and guidelines give a class I level of evidence A recommendation for the use of clopidogrel in these patients. The optimal timing of clopidogrel use has not been conclusively determined, but nearly all data available support early use in patients with NSTE-ACS. Despite this, clopidogrel usage is far less than expected based on current guidelines because of concern for bleeding at the time of possible subsequent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Clopidogrel use has been associated with increased perioperative bleeding at the time of CABG, but data are mixed. Numerous studies have conclusively shown that this bleeding risk is confined to those patients receiving clopidogrel within 5 days of CABG. The absolute number of patients exposed to this possible bleeding risk is very small relative to the > 1 million patients who present annually with NSTE-ACS and is estimated to be < 0.8% of these patients. Recent data have shown that (1) holding clopidogrel for 5 days before CABG is safe in patients with NSTE-ACS and (2) clopidogrel use in patients with NSTE-ACS decreases ischemic events in patients referred for CABG compared to patients who are not given clopidogrel. These data strongly challenge the notion that clopidogrel should be withheld until it is determined if the patient will be referred for CABG.

### Dual antiplatelet therapy for secondary prevention of coronary artery disease [^115mmRwp]. Open Heart (2017). Low credibility.

For patients treated with DAPT after PCI who subsequently undergo CABG, P2Y 12 receptor antagonist therapy should be resumed postoperatively to complete the recommended DAPT duration (class I). In patients with stable CAD undergoing CABG, DAPT with clopidogrel (initiated early in the postoperative period) for 12 months may be considered to improve vein graft patency (class IIb)(figure 1). Due to the lack of clinical evidence in patients with stable CAD, the use of potent P2Y 12 receptor inhibitors (prasugrel or ticagrelor) is currently not recommended. Nevertheless, the efficacy and safety of an intensified platelet inhibition using ticagrelor after CABG are currently investigated in the Ticagrelor in CABG (TiCAB) trial (NCT01755520), an ongoing, multicentre, double-blind, double-dummy, randomised trial that will compare ticagrelor with aspirin for the prevention of MACE within 12 months after CABG. The study will randomise 3850 patients undergoing CABG in a 1:1 fashion to either ticagrelor 90 mg twice daily or aspirin 100 mg once daily. Of note, the study medication will be started within 24 hours after surgery and maintained for 12 months. The primary endpoint will be a composite of CV death, MI, stroke and repeat revascularisation at 12 months after CABG.

European Heart Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Antithrombotic therapy is essential after coronary artery bypass graft surgery to reduce ischaemic events and prevent graft occlusion. Although aspirin remains the most commonly used agent, in higher-risk patients, dual antiplatelet therapy or combining antiplatelet therapy with oral anticoagulation may be beneficial, but this increases bleeding risk. The choice of antithrombotic therapy should be tailored to each patient, based on their ischaemic and bleeding risks, and regularly reassessed. Here, the scientific evidence underlying the key aspects of the choice of antithrombotic therapy after coronary artery bypass grafting is reviewed. Consensus statements for best clinical practice are provided and areas requiring further research are highlighted.

### Benefits and risks of using clopidogrel before coronary artery bypass surgery: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized trials and observational studies [^11654r3d]. The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

The benefits and risks associated with the use of clopidogrel before coronary artery bypass grafting are controversial, and these were investigated in the present meta-analysis.

Methods

A systematic literature search was performed to identify studies on the use of clopidogrel before coronary artery bypass grafting. Meta-analysis was performed according to the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews.

Results

The literature search yielded 3 prospective randomized studies and 17 observational studies with valid data. Randomized studies were post hoc analyses of the Clopidogrel as Adjunctive Reperfusion Therapy (CLARITY), Clopidogrel for the Reduction of Events During Observation (CREDO), and Clopidogrel in Unstable Angina to Prevent Recurrent Ischemic Events trials. Meta-analysis based on these data showed a nonsignificant reduced risk of immediate postoperative composite end point (death, myocardial infarction, or stroke) in the clopidogrel group (risk ratio [RR], 0.77; 95% confidence interval, 0.58–1.04). Data from the CREDO and CLARITY trials showed a similar risk of death (RR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.20–3.37), myocardial infarction (RR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.25–1.33), and major bleeding according to Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction criteria (RR, 1.48; 95% CI, 0.72–3.04). Meta-analysis of observational studies showed that preoperative exposure to clopidogrel was associated with an increased risk of death (RR, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.02–1.67), reoperation for bleeding (RR, 1.88; 95% CI, 1.37–2.58), blood loss (mean difference, 157.8 mL; 95% CI, 61.9–253.6), need of packed red blood cell transfusion (RR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.10–1.37), and increased use of blood products. A significantly reduced risk of postoperative myocardial infarction was observed among patients taking clopidogrel (RR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.48–0.82).

Conclusions

Contrary to the findings of post hoc analyses of randomized trials, observational studies showed that recent exposure to clopidogrel before coronary artery bypass grafting is associated with increased risk of postoperative death, reoperations for bleeding, blood loss, and need of blood transfusions.

Risks and benefits of preoperative exposure to antiplatelet therapy

Benefits of preoperative aspirin

Aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid, ASA) is recommended as secondary prevention therapy for all patients with proven coronary artery disease (CAD) and without contraindications. Its indication is even stronger for post-CABG patients (recommendation IA). The general consensus is that ASA treatment withdrawal has ominous prognostic implications in patients with CAD, especially in those with intracoronary stents, and should be advocated only when the bleeding risk clearly outweighs that of atherothrombotic events.

The benefits of continuing ASA until the day of CABG ('preoperative ASA') are less clear and may explain the wide variability in the management of ASA therapy in the perioperative period and differences between guidelines endorsed by different professional and scientific societies. This was based on the demonstration that ASA started the day before surgery was no more effective than ASA started 6 h after surgery at improving early (7- to 10-day) graft patency, but was associated with increased bleeding complications. More recent evidence suggests, however, that ASA use within 5–7 days prior to CABG halves mortality without significant increase in haemorrhage, blood product requirements, or related morbiditiesand reduces late infarction and repeat revascularization. Retrospective data show consistent benefit of preoperative aspirin within 5 days of surgery, including a reduction in cerebrovascular events and 30-day mortality.

Risks of preoperative aspirin

Evidence that preoperative ASA increases the risk of transfusion, re-exploration rate, and chest tube drainage was derived from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) conducted in the late 80s when blood conservation and cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) techniques were very different, such as little off-pump CABG surgery and higher aspirin ASA dosage. More recent analysis still suggests an increase in blood loss and more frequent use of blood products in patients exposed to ASA within 7 days of surgery. However, the underpowered nature of subanalyses precludes any strong recommendation on the time delay from ASA discontinuation to CABG in those at high risk of bleeding. Aspirin interruption 3 days prior to CABG may be considered in patients at very high risk for bleeding after individualized assessment or in patients who refuse blood transfusions(Table 1).

### Dual antiplatelet therapy with clopidogrel and aspirin versus aspirin monotherapy in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery [^116wK7Eo]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) has been established as an effective treatment for patients with extensive coronary artery disease. Aspirin is recommended as a fundamental secondary prevention medication for patients with CABG to maintain the benefits of revascularization and prevent major adverse cardiovascular events. However, patients treated with CABG still have a notable risk of subsequent major ischemic cardiac and cerebrovascular events, which may exceed 10% in the first 6 to 12 months after the surgery. Reduced postoperative responsiveness to aspirin, platelet activation, and thrombosis results in systemic hypercoagulability and early graft failure. These have been identified as vital contributing factors in this context.,

Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with aspirin plus a P2Y 12 receptor antagonist (eg, clopidogrel or ticagrelor) to enhance the antiplatelet effect, has been reported to slow down native coronary stenosis progressionand increase graft patency, in patients who underwent CABG as well as prevent recurrent stroke in patients with ischemic cerebrovascular disease. However, the question of whether the benefits associated with DAPT, especially the potential improvement in graft patency, translate into better clinical outcomes remains inadequately investigated with mixed results, and DAPT may increase the risk of bleeding. Clinical practice guidelines recommend that DAPT may be considered for selected patients who are at high risk of recurrent ischemic events, including those who presented with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) or received coronary stent implantation within 1 year before CABG, or underwent off‐pump CABG. However, they also acknowledge the need for more evidence in this area because these recommendations are merely based on expert consensus or underpowered secondary data (level C of evidence). There is even less evidence available on the efficacy and safety of DAPT in specific patient populations, such as patients with stable angina who constitute the majority of CABG procedures and those who underwent on‐pump CABG.

Therefore, the present study examined the association between post‐CABG DAPT with clopidogrel plus aspirin and clinical outcomes in a large all‐comer clinical practice registry. We hypothesized that DAPT may be associated with reduced risk of major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCE) when compared with aspirin monotherapy.

Antiplatelet therapy after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) — guideline recommendations and context: In patients undergoing CABG, aspirin (100–325 mg daily) should be initiated within 6 hours postoperatively and then continued indefinitely to reduce the occurrence of SVG closure and adverse cardiovascular events (COR 1, LOE A). In selected patients undergoing CABG, DAPT with aspirin and ticagrelor or clopidogrel for 1 year may be reasonable to improve vein graft patency compared with aspirin alone (COR 2b, LOE B-R). Observational and small randomized trials and meta-analyses support that DAPT after CABG improves vein graft patency, primarily among patients undergoing off-pump surgery and those with higher SYNTAX scores.

Overview of the net clinical benefit of dual antiplatelet therapy

Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT), the combination of ASA with a P2Y 12 inhibitor, namely clopidogrel, prasugrel, or ticagrelor (Table 1), has become the cornerstone of antiplatelet treatment before, during and after PCI, with significant reductions of stent thrombosis and ischaemic events compared with either aspirin alone or aspirin and anticoagulant drugs. – This combination increases the risk of major bleeding to an extent that appears to be associated with the degree of P2Y 12 inhibition achieved and all Phase 3 studies of P2Y 12 inhibitors vs. placebo or vs. clopidogrel, have excluded patients at high risk of bleeding. In the absence of contraindications, DAPT is currently recommended for 9–12 months following ACS based on evidence of enduring benefit over this time course in studies of clopidogrel, prasugrel, and ticagrelor. – There is no clear evidence for defining the optimal duration of DAPT after elective stenting. Indeed, none of the randomized trials were powered for ischaemic endpoints; all were open label and the time from stenting to randomization varied. – Therefore, weighing the quality of available evidence is difficult and these inferences need to be confirmed by ongoing mega trials. Usually, it is recommended to continue DAPT for 1 month after BMS implantation in stable angina,6–12 months after DES implantation in all patients, and up to one 1 year in all patients after ACS, irrespective of revascularisation strategy.

Antiplatelet therapy after CABG — Recommendation-specific supporting text states that "Surgical bleeding remains a concern in the perioperative and immediate postoperative periods", yet "older data have shown that aspirin improves vein graft patency", and that "Small RCTs, observational data, and meta-analyses have demonstrated that DAPT (mostly with aspirin and clopidogrel) after CABG improves vein graft patency, primarily among patients undergoing off-pump surgery", including the DACAB trial which "compared DAPT with a single antiplatelet regimen in 500 patients", where "Off-pump procedures were performed in 75% of these patients" and "At 1-year follow-up, the DAPT group was found to have the highest vein graft patency… compared with aspirin alone".

### Dual antiplatelet therapy with clopidogrel and aspirin versus aspirin monotherapy in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery [^112uN8pn]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Clinical Management

Patients were managed in accordance with local practice guidelines, and all procedures were performed using standard bypass techniques (Data S1). The choice between on‐pump and off‐pump CABG was at the discretion of the principal surgeon. Whenever possible, the internal thoracic artery was preferentially used for revascularization of the left anterior descending artery. The perioperative antiplatelet therapy was also left to the individual surgeon's evaluation and decision, though clopidogrel should have been discontinued at least 5 days before surgery if clinically feasible. Local guidelines and regulatory authorities do not specify rules or restrictions for the selection of patients who receive post‐CABG DAPT administration. Routinely, aspirin was started within 24 hours (ideally within 6 hours) after CABG in a daily dose of 100 mg and recommended to continue indefinitely. For patients who received DAPT, 75 mg of clopidogrel was added to 100 mg of aspirin daily without a loading dose, preferably within 48 hours after CABG, but when clinical stability was ensured and chest tube output was < 30 mL/hour for at least 2 hours. The duration of DAPT was determined by the treating physician, with the treatment typically maintained for a minimum of 1 month. Additional secondary prevention therapies (eg, statins, β‐blockers, or renin‐angiotensin system blockade) were recommended for all patients, if indicated, following clinical guidelines.

Outcomes

The primary outcome was the first occurrence of MACCE, defined as a composite of all‐cause mortality, myocardial infarction, stroke, and repeat revascularization within 6 months after CABG. Secondary outcomes included individual components of the primary outcome and major bleeding, which was defined as a composite of in‐hospital reoperation because of bleeding and hospitalization for bleeding after discharge. All outcome measures were prespecified, rigorously verified, and adjudicated by independent clinicians. Detailed definitions of the outcomes are provided in Data S1.

Population and baseline characteristics

The MIMIC III database contains records of 9243 patients undergoing isolated CABG due to CAD between 2001 and 2012. Patients were excluded if they were duplicated or unrecorded, or they had contraindications to either aspirin or clopidogrel, declined to be followed-up or were incarcerated. We also excluded the patients with metal valve or the presence of atrial fibrillation since anticoagulant therapy is necessary in this population. Moreover, we included patients that undergone emergent CABG, since this population usually is under-presented in registries and are more likely to receive DAPT. Therefore, in the end, a total of 3274 patients were included in this study. Of these, 72.8% (n = 2385) were treated with ASA alone postoperatively, and the rest (n = 889) were treated with ASA and clopidogrel. Moreover, 33.3% of the patients also received anticoagulant therapy after the surgery in the ASA (n = 794) and DAPT (n = 296) groups. Patients at high risk of thrombosis (e.g. ACS or coronary stenting within 30 days) who have had a minor/major bleeding event are advised to continue low-dose aspirin. Early reactivation of a second antiplatelet agent should be considered after bleeding control. The use of perioperative antiplatelet therapy was decided by individual surgeons. Clopidogrel should be stopped at least 5 days before surgery. There were no specific rules or restrictions from local authorities on selecting patients for post-CABG DAPT. Typically, aspirin 100 mg daily was started within 24 h (ideally within 6 h) after CABG and recommended to continue long-term. For DAPT, 75 mg clopidogrel daily was added to 100 mg aspirin without a loading dose, preferably within 48 h after CABG once clinical stability was ensured and chest tube output was < 30 mL/hour for at least 2 h. The duration of DAPT was determined by the treating physician, with a minimum of 1 month. Proton-pump inhibitors were recommended as a prophylactic therapy for gastrointestinal bleeding. Additional therapies like statins, beta-blockers, or renin-angiotensin system inhibitors were recommended for secondary prevention in suitable patients, following clinical guidelines. In summary, the choice of perioperative antiplatelet therapy was up to individual surgeons. Post-CABG, aspirin was started quickly and continued indefinitely. Clopidogrel could be added for DAPT after ensuring clinical stability, for a minimum of 1 month as decided by physicians. Other secondary prevention medicines were used as suitable per guidelines. The baseline characteristics of patients in the ASA and DAPT groups are presented in Table 1. Before matching, the two groups were balanced regarding most comorbidities, preoperative ASA and heparin use, and postoperative anticoagulant therapy which were determined by claimed prescriptions after surgery to reduce ischemic events. The DAPT group had a higher proportion of patients with peripheral artery disease, ACS, previous PCI or previous CABG history. Additionally, lower preoperative hemoglobin values and higher preoperative platelet counts were seen in the DAPT group. Following PSM, the 2 groups (n = 868) were balanced regarding all the baseline characteristics.

### Optimal antiplatelet strategy following coronary artery bypass grafting: a meta-analysis [^114193ST]. Heart (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is an established revascularisation strategy for multivessel and left main coronary artery disease. Although aspirin is routinely recommended for patients with CABG, the optimal antiplatelet regimen after CABG remains unclear. We evaluated the efficacies and risks of different antiplatelet regimens (dual (DAPT) versus single (SAPT), and dual with clopidogrel (DAPT-C) versus dual with ticagrelor or prasugrel (DAPT-T/P)) after CABG.

Methods

We followed Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines and performed a comprehensive literature search using PubMed, Ovid Medline, Ovid Embase and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. Data were extracted and pooled using random-effects models and Review Manager (V.5.4).

Results

Among the 2970 article abstracts screened, 215 full-text articles were reviewed and 38 studies totaling 77 447 CABG patients were included for analyses. DAPT compared with SAPT was associated with significantly lower all-cause mortality (OR 0.65 with 95% CI 0.50 to 0.86; p = 0.002), cardiovascular mortality (OR 0.53, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.84; p = 0.008), and major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCE) (OR 0.68, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.91; p = 0.01), but higher rates of major (OR 1.30, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.56; p = 0.007) and minor bleeding (OR 1.87, 95% CI 1.28 to 2.74; p = 0.001) after CABG. DAPT-T/P compared with DAPT-C was associated with significantly lower all-cause (OR 0.43, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.65; p ≤ 0.0001) and cardiovascular mortality (OR 0.44, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.80; p = 0.008), and no differences on other cardiovascular or bleeding outcomes after CABG.

Conclusion

In patients with CABG, DAPT compared with SAPT and DAPT-T/P compared with DAPT-C were associated with reduction in all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, especially in patients with acute coronary syndrome. Additionally, DAPT was associated with reduction in MACCE, but higher rates of major and minor bleeding. An individualised approach to choosing antiplatelet regimen is necessary for patients with CABG based on ischaemic and bleeding risks.

### Use of antiplatelet drugs after cardiac operations [^112XFUjZ]. Seminars in Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Unfortunately, venous bypass grafts still have a prominent role in operative coronary revascularization (coronary artery bypass graft [CABG]). Venous grafts develop pathologically occlusive disease that limits the effectiveness of CABG, and antiplatelet drugs following operation may limit this problem. The types and indications of antiplatelet drugs following CABG generate some controversy in the recent literature. This review surveys relevant evidence about the use of antiplatelet drugs following CABG to identify the controversial issues, define appropriate questions, and attempt to provide evidence-based interventions that may be helpful in limiting graft occlusion after CABG. Evidence suggests that, in most CABG patients, dual antiplatelet drugs (aspirin and clopidogrel), given after operation, minimizes early (within 1 year) graft failure and improves intermediate-term outcomes, better than single antiplatelet therapy with aspirin alone. There are gaps in the knowledge base that supports this contention, and future clinical trials will likely augment or alter this recommendation.

### Antithrombotic treatment after coronary artery bypass graft surgery: systematic review and network meta-analysis [^112nQdM8]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

Comparison with other studies

Aspirin monotherapy is currently recommended for patients with stable coronary artery disease after coronary artery bypass graft surgery to reduce saphenous vein graft failure. In patients who present with acute coronary syndromes, dual antiplatelet therapy is recommended to be resumed soon after coronary artery bypass graft surgery. However, there is a lack of evidence that dual antiplatelet therapy is associated with a decrease in thromboembolic complications or mortality in patients with stable coronary artery disease undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery. Few observational and randomised data suggest that additional drug intervention with dual antiplatelet therapy reduces the risk of saphenous vein graft failure. This effect appears to be more pronounced in patients undergoing off pump coronary artery bypass graft surgery than on pump coronary artery bypass graft surgery, or for arterial graft recipients.

The 2016 American guidelinesrecommend that in patients with stable coronary artery disease, aspirin 81 mg (75–100 mg) plus clopidogrel (started early after surgery) for 12 months after coronary artery bypass graft might be reasonable to improve saphenous vein graft patency (class IIb, level of evidence B). Conversely, the 2017 European guidelines state that there is insufficient evidence to generally recommend dual antiplatelet therapy to reduce saphenous vein graft failure. To mitigate the relative hypercoagulable state that off pump patients experience, the 2015 American Heart Association scientific statementrecommends the combination of aspirin and clopidogrel after off pump coronary artery bypass graft surgery (class I, level of evidence A). However, the European guidelines state that there is weak evidence to support dual antiplatelet therapy in this subset of patients, and the American guidelinesdo not comment on this.

### The evolving evidence base for coronary artery bypass grafting and arterial grafting in 2021: how to improve vein graft patency [^114rkN4K]. JTCVS Techniques (2021). Medium credibility.

Pharmacotherapy

Secondary preventative therapies are essential to maintain graft patency. The AHA recommends the use of antiplatelet (class I; LoE A) and statin (class I; LoE A) therapy post-CABG for all patients. Reduction of prothrombotic states post-CABG improves graft patency rates and prevents atherothrombotic complications. The AHA recommends that aspirin be administered preoperatively and within 6 hours post-CABG at doses of 81 to 325 mg daily and then continued indefinitely thereafter (class I; LoE A). The use of dual antiplatelet therapy over monotherapy with aspirin to improve graft patency is supported by the AHA in cases of off-pump CABG (class I; LoE A), but the benefits are not well established for patients with on-pump CABG (class IIb; LoE A). In a recent network meta-analysis (n = 4803), high-certainty evidence that demonstrated the use of aspirin with clopidogrel (OR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.42–0.86) or ticagrelor (OR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.31–0.79) was associated with reduced graft occlusion compared with aspirin alone. However, when only studies with on-pump CABG were analyzed, the use of aspirin with ticagrelor (OR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.32–0.80), but not with clopidogrel (OR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.43–1.07) was associated with reduced graft vein occlusion. These results are encouraging, as dual antiplatelet therapy strategies do not appear to increase the risk of major bleeding or myocardial infarction in these patients. Nevertheless, trial evidence regarding single-antiplatelet (ticagrelor) versus dual antiplatelet (ticagrelor plus aspirin) therapy remains inconsistent. The Different Antiplatelet Therapy Strategy after CABG Surgery (DACAB) trial (n = 500)showed improved 1-year SVG patency rates after elective CABG with ticagrelor plus aspirin versus aspirin alone (88.7% vs 76.5%; P < .001), whereas ticagrelor alone versus aspirin did not (82.8% vs 76.5%; p = 0.10). In DACAB, 75% of SVGs were performed with off-pump CABG, which is consistent with meta-analytic findings suggesting a greater benefit from dual antiplatelet therapy in off-pump CABG patients. The POPular CABG (Effect of Ticagrelor on SVG Patency in Patients Undergoing CABG Surgery) trial, published after the network meta-analysis by Solo and associates, randomized 499 patients to ticagrelor plus aspirin versus aspirin alone and found comparable SVG occlusion rates at 1 year (10.5% vs 9.1%; p = 0.38). The ongoing Ticagrelor Antiplatelet Therapy to Reduce Graft Events and Thrombosis (TARGET) trial (identifier) is randomizing 300 patients to 90 mg of ticagrelor twice daily versus 81 mg of aspirin twice daily to assess SVG occlusion and stenosis at 1 and 2 years.

WARNING: DIMINISHED EFFECTIVENESS IN POOR METABOLIZERS

WARNING: DIMINISHED EFFECTIVENESS IN POOR METABOLIZERS

See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning.

Effectiveness of Plavix depends on activation to an active metabolite by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) system, principally CYP2C19. (5.1)
Poor metabolizers treated with Plavix at recommended doses exhibit higher cardiovascular event rates following acute coronary syndrome (ACS) or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) than patients with normal CYP2C19 function. (12.5)
Tests are available to identify a patient's CYP2C19 genotype and can be used as an aid in determining therapeutic strategy. (12.5)
Consider alternative treatment or treatment strategies in patients identified as CYP2C19 poor metabolizers. (2.3, 5.1)

The effectiveness of Plavix is dependent on its activation to an active metabolite by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) system, principally CYP2C19 [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Plavix at recommended doses forms less of that metabolite and has a smaller effect on platelet function in patients who are CYP2C19 poor metabolizers. Poor metabolizers with acute coronary syndrome or undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention treated with Plavix at recommended doses exhibit higher cardiovascular event rates than do patients with normal CYP2C19 function. Tests are available to identify a patient's CYP2C19 genotype; these tests can be used as an aid in determining therapeutic strategy [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.5)]. Consider alternative treatment or treatment strategies in patients identified as CYP2C19 poor metabolizers [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Acute coronary syndrome (2.1)
Non-ST-segment elevation ACS (UA/NSTEMI): 300 mg loading dose followed by 75 mg once daily, in combination with aspirin (75–325 mg once daily)
STEMI: 75 mg once daily, in combination with aspirin (75–325 mg once daily), with or without a loading dose and with or without thrombolytics
Recent MI, recent stroke, or established peripheral arterial disease: 75 mg once daily (2.2)

2.1	Acute Coronary Syndrome

Plavix can be administered with or without food [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

For patients with non-ST-elevation ACS (UA/NSTEMI), initiate Plavix with a single 300 mg oral loading dose and then continue at 75 mg once daily. Initiate aspirin (75–325 mg once daily) and continue in combination with Plavix [see Clinical Studies (14.1)].
For patients with STEMI, the recommended dose of Plavix is 75 mg once daily orally, administered in combination with aspirin (75–325 mg once daily), with or without thrombolytics. Plavix may be initiated with or without a loading dose [see Clinical Studies (14.1)].

2.2 Recent MI, Recent Stroke, or Established Peripheral Arterial Disease

The recommended daily dose of Plavix is 75 mg once daily orally, with or without food [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

2.3 CYP2C19 Poor Metabolizers

CYP2C19 poor metabolizer status is associated with diminished antiplatelet response to clopidogrel. Although a higher dose regimen in poor metabolizers increases antiplatelet response [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.5)], an appropriate dose regimen for this patient population has not been established.

2.4 Use with Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPI)

Avoid using omeprazole or esomeprazole with Plavix. Omeprazole and esomeprazole significantly reduce the antiplatelet activity of Plavix. When concomitant administration of a PPI is required, consider using another acid-reducing agent with minimal or no CYP2C19 inhibitory effect on the formation of clopidogrel active metabolite [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### The impact of preoperative clopidogrel on outcomes after coronary artery bypass grafting [^113RVym1]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

This study evaluated the impact of preoperative clopidogrel exposure on outcomes of coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG).

Methods

Patients undergoing isolated CABG from January 2010 to February 2018 at a single institution were included. Primary stratification was based on exposure to clopidogrel within 5 days of CABG. Primary outcomes included blood product transfusion and mediastinal reexploration for bleeding. Secondary outcomes included early and late mortality, major postoperative complications, and hospital readmissions. Multivariable Cox regression was used to evaluate the risk-adjusted impact of preoperative clopidogrel on post-CABG mortality.

Results

Isolated CABG was performed in 7048 patients, including 1240 (18%) who had received clopidogrel within 5 days. Patients who received preoperative clopidogrel had higher rates of transfusions (53.4% vs 40.3%, P < .001) and reoperation for bleeding (3.0% vs 2.0%, P = .02). Most postoperative complication rates were similar, although those exposed to clopidogrel had higher rates of postoperative stroke (2.3% vs 1.2%, P = .002) and prolonged ventilation (10.2% vs 7.1%, P < .001). Clopidogrel exposure did not impact unadjusted or risk-adjusted 30-day, 1-year, or 5-year mortality or readmission. Discontinuing clopidogrel for at least 3 days preoperatively mitigated but did not eliminate the increased risk of blood transfusions after CABG.

Conclusions

CABG can be safely performed in patients with recent clopidogrel exposure with no increased risk of early or late mortality. However, CABG should be delayed for at least 5 days, if clinically feasible, to minimize transfusions and reoperation risk. In patients with more urgent indications, delaying CABG at least 3 days can mitigate but not eliminate the increased bleeding risk.

ACC/AHA/SCAI 2021 coronary revascularization — P2Y12 pretreatment before coronary angiography: Clopidogrel is the least potent agent, requiring longer time to platelet inhibition after a loading dose; in patients with stable angina, there is no compelling evidence to support routine pretreatment with a P2Y12 inhibitor before coronary angiography when the coronary anatomy is not known, and because the need for CABG still occurs in a nonnegligible proportion of patients referred for angiography, pretreatment can result in postponement of surgery.

Acute coronary syndromes — coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) perioperative management of oral P2Y12 inhibitors specifies interruption intervals and postoperative resumption. For clopidogrel, elective CABG: interrupt for 5 d before surgery; for urgent CABG: interruption for at least 24 h (ideally) and proceeding earlier than 5 d may be reasonable. For prasugrel, elective CABG: interrupt for 7 d before surgery; for urgent CABG: interruption for at least 24 h (ideally) and proceeding earlier than 7 d may be reasonable. For ticagrelor, elective CABG: interrupt for 3–5 d before surgery; for urgent CABG: interruption for at least 24 h (ideally) and proceeding earlier than 5 d may be reasonable. For all patients, oral P2Y12 inhibitor should be resumed after surgery when bleeding risk not excessive (typically 24–72 hours).

### Dual-antiplatelet therapy after coronary artery bypass grafting: a survey of UK cardiac surgeons [^111PSraa]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

Antiplatelet therapy after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is important in postoperative medical management. Although cardiac surgeons are well-versed in the guidelines regarding discontinuation of dual-antiplatelet therapy (DAPT; aspirin and a P2Y12 antagonist) before CABG to minimize bleeding risk, there is considerable variability in DAPT dosing after CABG. The objective of this study was to explore the current trends in DAPT after CABG in the UK to improve understanding of the existing practice.

Design

This study used an online survey with 9 questions about the use of DAPT after CABG. An invitation to participate was sent to all adult cardiac surgeons currently in practice in the UK and the Republic of Ireland.

Setting

The study was conducted in the UK and the Republic of Ireland.

Participants

Participants in this study were adult cardiac surgeons currently in practice in the UK and the Republic of Ireland.

Interventions

There were no interventions in this study.

Measurements and Main Results

Responses were received from across the UK (85.4% UK; 4% each from Scotland and Northern Ireland, 1.3% from Wales) and 5.3% from the Republic of Ireland. Fifty-seven percent of the respondents performed between 50 and 100 CABGs per year. Ninety-one percent of the respondents prescribe DAPT postoperatively, but the choice of which patients receive it varied. Most responding surgeons used DAPT for selective patient cohorts, such as those with acute coronary syndrome (51%), diffuse coronary artery disease (42%), perioperative myocardial infarction (36%), coronary endarterectomy (31%), or when bypassing a stented coronary artery (23%). Thirty-eight percent of the respondents began all their patients with CABGs on DAPT. The most preferred P2Y12 antagonist was clopidogrel, used by 75% of respondents and introduced on day 1 after surgical revascularization (71%). The routine duration for DAPT is 12 months, which 78% of the respondents preferred. The main reason for not starting DAPT in those surveyed was the bleeding risk associated with DAPT (72%).

Conclusions

The survey uncovered variation in the use of DAPT after CABG. However, DAPT remains the preferred strategy after CABG in the UK. The study highlighted the need to develop standardized protocols for DAPT after CABG.

### Antiplatelet effects of ticagrelor versus clopidogrel after coronary artery bypass graft surgery: a single-center randomized controlled trial [^113YVLyo]. The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

The study objective was to compare the onset of platelet inhibition (inhibition of platelet aggregation) between ticagrelor 90 mg twice per day and clopidogrel 75 mg once per day in patients receiving coronary artery bypass grafting.

Methods

In a single-center, randomized, open-label study, 140 patients receiving coronary artery bypass grafting were randomly assigned to the aspirin + ticagrelor group or the aspirin + clopidogrel group in a 1:1 ratio. Participants in the aspirin + ticagrelor group took aspirin 100 mg once per day and ticagrelor 90 mg twice per day. Participants in the aspirin + clopidogrel group took aspirin 100 mg once per day and clopidogrel 75 mg once per day. Platelet function was determined before study treatment (0 hours); at 2 hours, 8 hours, 24 hours, and 72 hours after medication; and during follow-up at 30 days after surgery.

Results

Inhibition of platelet aggregation at 2 hours after the first drug administration was greater for the aspirin + ticagrelor group than for the aspirin + clopidogrel group (34.2% [interquartile range, 9.1–66.0] vs 5.3% [interquartile range, -14.3–22.0], P < .001) and at all times in the study period (P < .001). More patients reached inhibition of platelet aggregation maximum within 24 hours in the aspirin + ticagrelor group than in the aspirin + clopidogrel group (52.9% vs 27.5%, P = .006). The average inhibition of platelet aggregation maximum from 2 to 24 hours was still greater in the aspirin + ticagrelor group than in the aspirin + clopidogrel group (72.3% ± 15.4% vs 49.2% ± 46.8%, P < .001). There were no differences in terms of bleeding or major adverse cardiac events between the 2 groups.

Conclusions

In patients receiving coronary artery bypass grafting, the onset of action was faster and the peak inhibition of platelet aggregation was higher with ticagrelor than with clopidogrel.

### Extended duration of dual-antiplatelet therapy after percutaneous coronary intervention: how long is too long? [^112QSaUz]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Table 2
Clinical Characteristics Benefiting From Extended‐Duration DAPT

In summary, prolonged DAPT appears more beneficial in patients with ACS treated with ticagrelor or prasugrel, with risk factors for recurrent ischemia at a cost of increased bleeding. However, any clinician will also recognize that not all bleeding or ACS events carry the same risk. Indeed, a clinician‐patient shared decision making seems apt when discussing the optimal duration of DAPT. On the other hand, the clinician must also remember that trials evaluating DAPT over 5 years are currently lacking. Therefore, although possibly beneficial, any DAPT beyond this time period has no strong clinical evidence. With the continuous medication and stent advances, the optimal DAPT duration will likely be altered, but until then the current guidelines supporting DAPT duration of 12 months in ACS with further tailoring of therapy based on an individual risk of further ischemic or bleeding events provide an excellent framework to begin. Evolving research will help us further understand the risks and benefits of extended‐duration DAPT, especially with the newer‐generation stents.

Platelet function monitoring

The interindividual variability in pharmacodynamic response to clopidogrel leads to variability in the time taken to recover normal platelet reactivity following cessation of clopidogrel. This is important because several studies have shown that the level of platelet reactivity at the time of surgery can predict the risk of CABG-related bleeding. – Although bedside platelet function testing has not, so far, been successful in guiding antiplatelet therapy during PCI to prevent ischaemic events, treatment monitoring using bedside testing has been suggested as an option to guide treatment interruption rather than arbitrary use of a specified period of delay. Platelet inhibitory response to clopidogrel determines CABG-related bleeding and a strategy based on preoperative platelet function testing to determine the timing of CABG in clopidogrel-treated patients led to ≈50% shorter waiting time than recommended in the current guidelines. For these reasons, the 2012 Update of the Society of Thoracic Surgeons Guideline suggested that a delay of even a day or 2 is reasonable to decrease bleeding and thrombotic risk in ACS patients. Point-of-care monitoring of platelet aggregation or whole-blood clot properties is associated with reduced perioperative bleeding and ischaemic complications especially during off-pump CABG surgery. Bedside platelet function testing has been evaluated during clopidogrel exposure but might also be useful in prasugrel- or ticagrelor-treated patients, as recently shown for prasugrel. A proposed strategy for preoperative management of P2Y 12 inhibitors and bridging is shown in Table 3. When the bleeding risk is low, short timing of cessation of P2Y 12 inhibitors prior to CABG surgery is encouraged in addition to bridging therapies that should be used when the thrombotic risk appears high. Platelet function testing may be used when the bleeding risk is low and the thrombotic risk is low. Evidence for PFT is derived from a single randomized study that was performed without point-of-care assayand the interpretation of high platelet reactivity in patients at risk for bleeding remains unclear.

### Eight-year follow-up of the clopidogrel after surgery for coronary artery disease (CASCADE) trial [^113bYbSK]. The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

In this 8 years' follow-up study, we evaluated the long-term outcomes of the addition of clopidogrel to aspirin during the first year after coronary artery bypass grafting, versus aspirin plus placebo, with respect to survival, major adverse cardiac, or major cerebrovascular events, including revascularization, functional status, graft patency, and native coronary artery disease progression.

Methods

In the initial Clopidogrel After Surgery for Coronary Artery Disease trial, 113 patients were randomized to receive either daily clopidogrel (n = 56) or placebo (n = 57), in addition to aspirin, in a double-blind fashion for 1 year after coronary artery bypass grafting. All patients were re-evaluated to collect long-term clinical data. Surviving patients with a glomerular filtration rate > 30 mL/min were asked to undergo a coronary computed tomography angiogram to evaluate the late saphenous vein graft patency and native coronary artery disease progression.

Results

At a median follow-up of 7.6 years, survival rate was 85.5% ± 3.8% (P = .23 between the 2 groups). A trend toward enhanced freedom from all-cause death or major adverse cardiac or cerebrovascular events, including revascularization, was observed in the aspirin-clopidogrel group (P = .11). No difference in functional status or freedom from angina was observed between the 2 groups (P > .57). The long-term patency of saphenous vein graft was 89.11% in the aspirin-clopidogrel group versus 91.23% in the aspirin-placebo group (P = .79). A lower incidence of moderate to severe native disease progression was observed in the aspirin-clopidogrel group versus the aspirin-placebo group (7 out of 122 vs 13 out of 78 coronary segments that showed progression, respectively [odds ratio, 0.3 ± 0.2; 95% confidence interval, 0.1–0.8; p = 0.02]).

Conclusions

At 8 years' follow-up, the addition of clopidogrel to aspirin during the first year after coronary artery bypass grafting exhibited a lower incidence of moderate to severe progression of native coronary artery disease and a trend toward higher freedom from major adverse cardiac or cerebrovascular events, including revascularization, or death in the aspirin-clopidogrel group.

### Effect of clopidogrel use post coronary artery bypass surgery on graft patency [^11117LFK]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Clopidogrel use post coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) has become more popular under the assumption that it improves graft patency. The purpose of this sub-analysis from the Randomized On and Off-Pump Bypass (ROOBY) trial is to evaluate the role of clopidogrel use post CABG to improve graft patency when added to standard aspirin therapy.

Methods

The ROOBY trial was a multi-center, randomized, controlled clinical trial that compared on-pump versus off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Clopidogrel use post CABG was left at the discretion of the operator. Detailed data regarding the use and timing of clopidogrel post CABG were collected prospectively, along with 1-year angiograms to evaluate graft status.

Results

Of the 2,203 subjects undergoing CABG, 953 patient records had complete clopidogrel use and 1-year angiographic data. Of these, 345 (36.2%) received clopidogrel post CABG prior to discharge. Compared with patients with no post-CABG clopidogrel use, baseline characteristics were similar for the clopidogrel group except for the following: lower preoperative aspirin use (80.2% vs 86.7%, p = 0.009); higher preoperative clopidogrel use (23.5% vs 14.0%, p < 0.001), less on-pump (35.9% vs 55.9%, p < 0.0001); and lower endoscopic vein harvesting (30.8% vs 42.5%, p < 0.001) rates. Overall 1-year graft patency rates were not different between the clopidogrel and no-clopidogrel groups (86.5% vs 85.3%, p = 0.43). Multivariable analyses did not alter these findings.

Conclusions

This study suggests that routine post-CABG clopidogrel use may not translate to improved 1-year graft patency. Future studies appear warranted to better define the role of more aggressive antiplatelet therapy post CABG on graft patency and clinical outcomes.

### Clopidogrel and aspirin versus clopidogrel alone on graft patency after coronary artery bypass grafting [^116hv11T]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Clopidogrel and aspirin are the most popular antiplatelet agents for anticoagulation management after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) in clinical practice, but there is neither a standard antiplatelet therapy for patients undergoing CABG, nor an exact conclusion about its effects on graft patency until now.

Methods

One-hundred and ninety-seven selected patients undergoing CABG were assigned to two groups according to antiplatelet drug: the clopidogrel group of 102 patients who received clopidogrel (75 mg) daily; and the combination group of 95 patients who received clopidogrel (75 mg) plus aspirin (100 mg) daily. Multislice computed tomography angiography was performed to evaluate graft patency at 1 month and 12 months after CABG.

Results

There were no significant differences between the two groups in preoperational data. At 1 month and 12 months after CABG graft patency rates of clopidogrel group were, respectively, 99.0% and 96.9% for the left internal mammary artery (LIMA) and 98.1% and 93.5% for the saphenous vein grafts; those of the combination group were, respectively, 98.9% and 97.8% for LIMA, and 98.2% and 96.3% for saphenous vein grafts. There were no significant differences in graft patency between the two groups (p > 0.05).

Conclusions

Either clopidogrel plus aspirin or clopidogrel alone maintain high graft patency in the early postoperative phase after CABG. The observed trend toward higher patency rates in patients treated with clopidogrel plus aspirin compared to those in the clopidogrel group did not reach statistical significance.

### Dual antiplatelet therapy with clopidogrel and aspirin versus aspirin monotherapy in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery [^113HHH9W]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

DAPT may offer specific benefits in subsets of the CABG patient population who are in a prothrombotic state or have residual cardiovascular risk, such as those presenting with ACS or diabetes mellitus and those who underwent off‐pump bypass surgery. Current guidelines recommend post‐CABG DAPT in patients with ACS, based on data from secondary analysis of DAPT trials in the setting of non‐ST‐ or ST‐segment–elevation myocardial infarction, in which only a small proportion (≈10%) of participants underwent CABG at 20 to 100 days after the initiation of DAPT. The present study adds credibility to the recommendation in a large contemporary CABG cohort. However, unlike for ACS, scarce data exist on the effect of DAPT after surgical revascularization for stable angina, and it remains unclear whether the presenting symptoms result in clinical differences relevant to secondary antiplatelet therapy. We observed a greater benefit of DAPT in patients with stable angina, possibly because of these patients having fewer factors linked to low responsiveness to clopidogrel. Our results also support the strategy of intensifying platelet inhibition with DAPT after off‐pump CABG and expanding the use of DAPT to those who underwent on‐pump bypass surgery. Given the continued debate on off‐pump versus on‐pump bypass grafting as well as the aforementioned response variability to clopidogrel, the underlying mechanisms explaining the variation in DAPT‐related benefits warrant further exploration.

### Antithrombotic treatment after coronary artery bypass graft surgery: systematic review and network meta-analysis [^115nuNkn]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

The clinical benefits of adding a P2Y12 inhibitor to aspirin originate from the Clopidogrel in Unstable Angina to Prevent Recurrent Events (CURE) trial. Participants with non-ST elevation acute coronary syndromes who were allocated to receive aspirin plus clopidogrel experienced a major reduction in the composite outcome of death from cardiovascular causes, non-fatal myocardial infarction, or stroke, and a range of related ischaemic events. However, there was a tradeoff of increased risk of bleeding, and most of the major bleeding events were gastrointestinal and arterial access site bleeds. In our analysis, although the occurrence of major bleeding with aspirin plus ticagrelor was not statistically significant compared with aspirin alone, the network estimates showed an odds ratio of 1.93, and wide 95% confidence intervals (0.30 to 12.4) compared with aspirin plus clopidogrel (0.85, 0.30 to 2.37). The lack of different doses of clopidogrel precludes further analysis. Notably, the combination of aspirin plus rivaroxaban 2.5 mg twice daily or rivaroxaban 5 mg twice daily alone did not reduce saphenous vein graft failure compared with aspirin alone in the COMPASS (Cardiovascular OutcoMes for People Using Anticoagulation StrategieS) coronary artery bypass graft trial. However, the combination of aspirin plus rivaroxaban 2.5 mg twice daily was associated with similar reductions in major adverse cardiovascular events, and this was consistent with the findings of the main COMPASS trial. Therefore, because major bleeding has been associated with increased morbidity and mortality, the risk of bleeding should be carefully balanced against the benefits when planning long term (> 12 months) dual antiplatelet therapy in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery.

Acute coronary syndromes — management of oral P2Y12 inhibitors before and after CABG is as follows: For clopidogrel, elective CABG: interrupt for 5 d before surgery, and for urgent CABG: interruption for at least 24 h (ideally) and proceeding earlier than 5 d may be reasonable. For prasugrel, elective CABG: interrupt for 7 d before surgery, and for urgent CABG: interruption for at least 24 h (ideally) and proceeding earlier than 7 d may be reasonable. For ticagrelor, elective CABG: interrupt for 3–5 d before surgery, and for urgent CABG: interruption for at least 24 h (ideally) and proceeding earlier than 5 d may be reasonable. For all patients, oral P2Y12 inhibitor should be resumed after surgery when bleeding risk not excessive (typically 24–72 hours).

Regarding perioperative care for coronary artery disease, more specifically with respect to periprocedural antiplatelet therapy, for CABG, CAIC/CCS 2024 guidelines recommend to decide on the time of clopidogrel discontinuation for CABG based on factors such as coronary anatomy, hemodynamic stability, bleeding risk, and surgical team expertise, with ideal timing between 2 and 7 days for patients not requiring urgent CABG.

### A randomized, parallel group, double-blind study of ticagrelor compared with aspirin for prevention of vascular events in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft operation: rationale and design of the ticagrelor in CABG (TiCAB) trial: an investigator-initiated trial [^113Ciagy]. American Heart Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Background

For patients with coronary artery disease undergoing coronary bypass surgery, acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) currently represents the gold standard of antiplatelet treatment. However, adverse cardiovascular event rates in the first year after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) still exceed 10%. Graft failure, which is predominantly mediated by platelet aggregation, has been identified as a major contributing factor in this context. Therefore, intensified platelet inhibition is likely to be beneficial. Ticagrelor, an oral, reversibly binding and direct-acting P2Y12 receptor antagonist, provides a rapid, competent, and consistent platelet inhibition and has shown beneficial results compared with clopidogrel in the subset of patients undergoing bypass surgery in a large previous trial.

Hypothesis

Ticagrelor is superior to ASA for the prevention of major cardiovascular events within 1 year after CABG.

Study Design

The TiCAB trial (NCT01755520) is a multicenter, phase III, double-blind, double-dummy, randomized trial comparing ticagrelor with ASA for the prevention of major cardiovascular events within 12 months after CABG. Patients undergoing CABG will be randomized in a 1:1 fashion to either ticagrelor 90 mg twice daily or ASA 100 mg once daily. The study medication will be started within 24 hours after surgery and maintained for 12 months. The primary end point is the composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke, and repeat revascularization at 12 months after CABG. The sample size is based on an expected event rate of 13% of the primary end point within the first 12 months after randomization in the control group, a 2-sided α level of .0492 (to preserve the overall significance level of .05 after planned interim analysis), a power of 0.80%, 2-sided testing, and an expected relative risk of 0.775 in the active group compared with the control group and a dropout rate of 2%. According to power calculations based on a superiority design for ticagrelor, it is estimated that 3,850 patients should be enrolled.

Summary

There is clinical equipoise on the issue of optimal platelet inhibition after CABG. The TiCAB trial will provide a pivotal comparison of the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor compared with ASA after CABG.

### Different antithrombotic strategies after coronary artery bypass grafting to prevent adverse events: a retrospective analysis [^116D8yjS]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Coronary artery bypass grafting surgery (CABG) is a major revascularization approach for patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) and is widely used across the world. According to the current guidelines, CABG is recommended for stable CAD with proximal left anterior descending stenosis, left main stenosis and three-vessel disease, especially when the patient has a high SYNTAX score or diabetes mellitus. CABG is performed to relieve the symptoms of myocardial ischemia and improve the prognosis. Perioperative management is critical to reduce the main adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events and complications after surgery.

Antithrombotic treatment plays an important role in reducing adverse cardiovascular events and is mandatory in CAD patients undergoing myocardial revascularization. Antiplatelet therapy is recommended early after operation for patients with low bleeding risk due to its prevention of early graft failure as well as its reduction of adverse events and death after CABG in some studies. Early use of dual antiplatelet drugs is also reasonable for patients with a high risk of ischemia and thrombosis, but the risk of bleeding should be taken into consideration. In addition, heparin for anticoagulation is administered in some centers at an early stage after CABG for the prevention of ischemic events. However, the current guidelines make no recommendation on the early use of heparin after CABG. Whether it is safe and effective to prevent early adverse events is still unknown.

### How Do type of preoperative P2YReceptor inhibitor and withdrawal time affect bleeding? [^1179uTqA]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Despite recommendations for standardized preoperative waiting of at least 3, 5, and 7 days for ticagrelor, clopidogrel, and prasugrel, respectively, there is still substantial interinstitutional variation in preoperative discontinuation of dual antiplatelet therapy in patients needing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG).

Methods

In 299 patients undergoing CABG with or without valve intervention less than 7 days after last P2Y 12 receptor inhibition, this study evaluated calculated red blood cell loss and Bleeding Academic Research Consortium type 4 (BARC-4) bleeding.

Results

A total of 83% of patients underwent CABG less than 48 hours after last drug intake. Calculated blood loss was lower in patients taking clopidogrel as compared with prasugrel or ticagrelor (1063 mL [690 to 1394 mL] vs 1351 mL [876 to 1829 mL] vs 1330 mL [994 to 1691 mL]; P < .001). Overall, 135 (45%) patients sustained BARC-4 bleeding; the incidence differed among the groups (P = .015) and was significantly higher in prasugrel-treated patients, as compared with clopidogrel-treated patients. In multivariable linear regression analysis, European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation II (EuroSCORE II), aspirin dose, cardiopulmonary bypass time, drug withdrawal time, and type of P2Y 12 receptor inhibitor were significantly associated with red blood cell loss. Compared with 0 to 24 hours, a period of more than 48 hours of preoperative discontinuation substantially reduced calculated blood loss by 37% to 48% and BARC-4 bleeding by 58% to 71%, depending on the P2Y 12 receptor inhibitor.

Conclusions

Exposure to prasugrel and ticagrelor 24 hours or less before CABG increases both calculated blood loss and BARC-4 bleeding as compared with clopidogrel. Although discontinuation for longer than 48 hours substantially reduced calculated blood loss and BARC-4 bleeding across all P2Y 12 receptor inhibitors, our single-center data further support strict adherence to the 2017 guidelines whenever justified by stable hemodynamics and nonjeopardized myocardium.

Coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery — perioperative continuation vs interruption and preoperative hold times: In patients who are receiving ASA (aspirin) and undergoing CABG surgery, we suggest continuation of ASA over interruption; in patients receiving a P2Y12 inhibitor drug, we suggest interruption of the P2Y12 inhibitor over continuation perioperatively. For pre-operative P2Y12 interruption prior to the day of surgery/procedure, we suggest 7 days for prasugrel, 5 days for clopidogrel, and 3 to 5 days for ticagrelor.

### Clopidogrel bisulfate (Plavix) [^114Wxd3C]. FDA (2012). Low credibility.

6.1 Clinical Studies Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions and durations of follow up, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

Plavix has been evaluated for safety in more than 54,000 patients, including over 21,000 patients treated for 1 year or more. The clinically important adverse reactions observed in trials comparing Plavix plus aspirin to placebo plus aspirin and trials comparing Plavix alone to aspirin alone are discussed below.

Bleeding

CURE

In CURE, Plavix use with aspirin was associated with an increase in major bleeding (primarily gastrointestinal and at puncture sites) compared to placebo with aspirin (see Table 1). The incidence of intracranial hemorrhage (0.1%) and fatal bleeding (0.2%) were the same in both groups. Other bleeding events that were reported more frequently in the clopidogrel group were epistaxis, hematuria, and bruise.

The overall incidence of bleeding is described in Table 1.

Ninety-two percent (92%) of the patients in the CURE study received heparin or low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), and the rate of bleeding in these patients was similar to the overall results.

COMMIT

In COMMIT, similar rates of major bleeding were observed in the Plavix and placebo groups, both of which also received aspirin (see Table 2).

CAPRIE (Plavix vs. Aspirin)

In CAPRIE, gastrointestinal hemorrhage occurred at a rate of 2.0% in those taking Plavix vs. 2.7% in those taking aspirin; bleeding requiring hospitalization occurred in 0.7% and 1.1%, respectively. The incidence of intracranial hemorrhage was 0.4% for Plavix compared to 0.5% for aspirin.

Other bleeding events that were reported more frequently in the Plavix group were epistaxis and hematoma.

Other Adverse Events

In CURE and CHARISMA, which compared Plavix plus aspirin to aspirin alone, there was no difference in the rate of adverse events (other than bleeding) between Plavix and placebo.

In CAPRIE, which compared Plavix to aspirin, pruritus was more frequently reported in those taking Plavix. No other difference in the rate of adverse events (other than bleeding) was reported.

### Extended duration of dual-antiplatelet therapy after percutaneous coronary intervention: how long is too long? [^115eYUqy]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

The most recent American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines on duration of dual‐antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with drug‐eluting stents (DESs) give a class I recommendation to continue DAPT for at least 12 months after an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and at least 6 months after revascularization in the setting of stable ischemic heart disease. 1 These guidelines also give a class IIb recommendation for continuation of DAPT beyond 6 and 12 months in patients with stable ischemic heart disease and ACS, respectively, if these patients have tolerated DAPT without a bleeding event and are at low risk for bleeding in the future. 1 However, they do not provide any guidance with respect to how long DAPT should be continued and leave it to the clinician to discuss the risks versus benefits with the patient and individualize antiplatelet therapy. Therefore, in clinical practice, we often see patients on DAPT several years after a PCI as they are instructed by their providers to never discontinue them. In fact, given how much the importance of taking DAPT in the early period after PCI is emphasized, patients at times are uncomfortable stopping the second antiplatelet agent at any time. The lack of a clear recommendation is not surprising, despite multiple recent randomized controlled trials 2, 3, 4, 5 evaluating differing durations of extended DAPT given several evolving factors and the overall risk/benefits of DAPT.

Guidelines commenting on DAPT duration have largely included trials using clopidogrel and early‐generation stents. The advent of more potent P2Y 12 inhibitors, such as prasugrel and ticagrelor, has reduced major adverse cardiovascular events, but at the cost of increased bleeding. 6, 7 On the other hand, the newer‐generation DESs, with their thinner stent struts, a more biocompatible polymer, and favorable drug‐eluting characteristics, have considerably decreased the risk of stent thrombosis, particularly late stent thrombosis. 8 Although extended DAPT duration has been associated with reduction in recurrent myocardial infarction (MI) and cardiovascular death, there are statistically significant increases in major bleeding events. 2, 5 With the increased recognition of bleeding events and advancements in DES technology, it has been hypothesized that shorter durations of DAPT may be more appropriate. The European and American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines have already reduced the minimum absolutely required duration of DAPT by incorporating short DAPT into their recommendations. 1, 9 However, the question about the value of extended DAPT duration in selected patients still remains to be answered.

### P2Y12 inhibitor monotherapy or dual antiplatelet therapy after coronary revascularisation: individual patient level meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^113Xyp2b]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

Our individual participant data meta-analysis of the totality of available randomised studies investigating P2Y 12 inhibitor monotherapy after revascularisation, including 24 096 patients mainly after percutaneous coronary intervention, provides strong evidence that P2Y 12 inhibitor monotherapy is non-inferior to DAPT. We chose a non-inferiority margin that preserved half of the treatment effect of aspirin observed in the historical aspirin trials, under the rationale that the experimental arm consists of aspirin withdrawal and that the treatment effect of DAPT versus placebo is not known. P2Y 12 inhibitor monotherapy was associated with a lower risk of major bleeding and net adverse clinical events compared with DAPT. The main findings were corroborated by all sensitivity analyses. Our analysis suggests that female patients may derive particular benefit from P2Y 12 inhibitor monotherapy owing to the lower risk of major adverse cardiovascular events, largely driven by a reduction in cardiovascular death. P2Y 12 inhibitor monotherapy was associated with lower bleeding rates consistently across subgroups, although the magnitude of this treatment effect varied by the potency of the P2Y 12 inhibitor in the experimental and control groups, which has important implications for practice.

Rationale for P2Y 12 inhibitor monotherapy after coronary revascularisation

A six to 12 month DAPT regimen is endorsed with a class I recommendation after percutaneous coronary intervention, irrespective of the clinical presentation or revascularisation techniques, and after coronary artery bypass grafting in patients with myocardial infarction. This reflects the robust evidence indicating lower ischaemic risk with DAPT compared with aspirin monotherapy. However, DAPT invariably confers a heightened risk of major bleeding affecting mortality and morbidity, and its use requires careful assessment of the trade-off between risks and anticipated benefits. An individualised approach to the DAPT regimen, modulating the duration of P2Y 12 inhibition on a background of aspirin therapy, has gained consensus. However, this approach is poorly standardised and lacks prospective validation. An alternative approach consists of early aspirin withdrawal and continuation with P2Y 12 inhibitor monotherapy up to 12 months after percutaneous coronary intervention or direct initiation of P2Y 12 inhibitor monotherapy after coronary artery bypass grafting. Trials examining this approach were generally powered for non-inferiority with respect to ischaemic endpoints, based on arbitrary non-inferiority margins, and/or superiority with respect to bleeding or net adverse clinical events, including a combination of ischaemic and bleeding endpoints. They mostly showed no excess of ischaemic events and lower bleeding rates with P2Y 12 inhibitor monotherapy instead of DAPT. However, the imprecisions around the composite or individual ischaemic endpoint estimates entailed the loss of the entire treatment effect observed in historical aspirin trials.

### Randomized trial of aspirin and clopidogrel versus aspirin alone for the prevention of coronary artery bypass graft occlusion: the preoperative aspirin and postoperative antiplatelets in coronary artery bypass grafting study [^111T2FVQ]. American Heart Journal (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Routine use of postoperative aspirin after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) reduces graft failure and cardiovascular events. The efficacy and safety of adding clopidogrel to aspirin for the prevention of graft failure and cardiovascular events after CABG are unknown. We performed a pilot study measuring safety and efficacy outcomes of aspirin and clopidogrel therapy after CABG.

Methods

We randomized 100 patients undergoing CABG to receive placebo or clopidogrel started after surgery and for 30 days. All patients received aspirin 81 mg daily. Graft patency was measured by cardiac computed tomography angiography at 30 days.

Results

Clinical follow-up was complete for 99 patients, and 79 (80%) underwent computed tomography angiography. The proportion of patients with ≥ 1 occluded graft was not significantly different between placebo and clopidogrel groups (9/39 [23.1%] vs 7/40 [17.5%], relative risk 0.95, 95% CI 0.80–1.14, P = .54). Among radial artery grafts, the placebo group had a significantly higher number of occlusions or "string signs" compared with the clopidogrel group (7/16 [43.8%] vs 2/19 [10.5%], relative risk 0.24, 95% CI 0.06–1.00, P = .05). There was no difference between placebo and clopidogrel groups in the safety outcomes of total postoperative bleeding, transfusions, bleeding events, and reexploration and in the efficacy outcomes of nonfatal myocardial infarction, stroke, and death.

Conclusions

This pilot study confirms a high rate of graft occlusion after CABG surgery and suggests that the addition of clopidogrel to aspirin is feasible and safe and may be superior for prevention of graft failure in radial artery grafts.

### Antithrombotic treatment after coronary artery bypass graft surgery: systematic review and network meta-analysis [^1127CGJp]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

Not all the included trials reported the actual data on duration of treatment. Therefore, patients might have received different durations of antithrombotic treatments, which resulted in patient level covariate effects. Post hoc meta-regression analysis did not show evidence of an association between duration of treatment (originally prespecified by the trial authors, not actual duration) and treatment effect for some drug interventions; however, it was not possible to estimate the effect of treatment duration for all treatments because of multicollinearity and missing linkage (supplementary table 13). Moreover, this meta-regression probably had low power to detect such an association, and its credibility is questionable owing to the lack of patient level data; therefore, it is subject to ecological bias.

Further research is needed to improve strategies to optimise saphenous vein graft patency after coronary artery bypass graft surgery. We need studies of adequate duration and sample size that report saphenous vein graft failure at different time points to determine the potential legacy effect of dual antiplatelet therapy during the first year after coronary artery bypass graft surgery. Additionally, these studies should report long term (that is, five or 10 years) incidence of saphenous vein graft failure, and patient important outcomes (mortality, ischaemic, or bleeding events).

Conclusion and policy implications

The results of this network meta-analysis suggest an important absolute benefit of adding ticagrelor or clopidogrel to aspirin to prevent saphenous vein graft failure after coronary artery bypass graft surgery. Dual antiplatelet therapy after surgery should be tailored to the patient by balancing the safety and efficacy profile of the drug intervention against important patient outcomes. Future guideline updates are needed to optimise antithrombotic management of patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery. Meanwhile, dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin plus ticagrelor or aspirin plus clopidogrel could be considered for most patients after surgery.

### Clopidogrel kit [^114zegjn]. FDA (2017). Low credibility.

Most of the benefit of clopidogrel occurred in the first two months, but the difference from placebo was maintained throughout the course of the trial (up to 12 months) (see Figure 2).

The effect of clopidogrel did not differ significantly in various subgroups, as shown in Figure 3. The benefits associated with clopidogrel were independent of the use of other acute and long-term cardiovascular therapies, including heparin/LMWH, intravenous glycoprotein IIb/IIIa (GPIIb/IIIa) inhibitors, lipid-lowering drugs, beta-blockers, and ACE-inhibitors. The efficacy of clopidogrel was observed independently of the dose of aspirin (75 to 325 mg once daily). The use of oral anticoagulants, non-study antiplatelet drugs, and chronic NSAIDs was not allowed in CURE.

The use of clopidogrel in CURE was associated with a decrease in the use of thrombolytic therapy (71 patients [1.1%] in the clopidogrel group, 126 patients [2.0%] in the placebo group; relative risk reduction of 43%), and GPIIb/IIIa inhibitors (369 patients [5.9%] in the clopidogrel group, 454 patients [7.2%] in the placebo group, relative risk reduction of 18%). The use of clopidogrel in CURE did not affect the number of patients treated with CABG or PCI (with or without stenting), (2,253 patients [36.0%] in the clopidogrel group, 2,324 patients [36.9%] in the placebo group; relative risk reduction of 4.0%).

### Effect of preoperative clopidogrel on outcomes of isolated coronary artery bypass graft: an STS national database analysis [^114cwqAr]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

We analyzed The Society of Thoracic Surgeons Database to investigate risks and optimal timing for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) after clopidogrel administration.

Methods

Patients were categorized based on clopidogrel use within 5 days and further stratified by days from the last dose (0 to 5 days). Controls were patients who did not receive clopidogrel within 5 days of surgery. The primary outcome was operative mortality, and secondary outcomes included mediastinal reexploration for bleeding and blood product use.

Results

Among 148,317 isolated CABG, 19,553 patients (13.2%) received clopidogrel within 5 days. Minimal differences in operative mortality (2.8% vs 2.1%, P < .001), but higher rates of mediastinal reexploration (3.5% vs 2.1%, P < .001) and blood product utilization (72.7% vs 56.8%, P < .001) were observed in the clopidogrel group. The adjusted odds ratio of operative mortality peaked on the day of clopidogrel administration but was comparable to controls thereafter. The odds of reexploration were highest on day 0, decreasing gradually to a plateau after day 3. Patients who underwent operations on day 3 after clopidogrel administration had similar odds of operative mortality and mediastinal reexploration for bleeding and shorter total and preoperative lengths of stay but higher blood product use compared with day 5.

Conclusions

CABG within 5 days from clopidogrel is associated with a modest increase in operative mortality and reexploration for bleeding and a substantial increase in blood product use. Risks decreased with increasing time from discontinuation, plateauing after 3 days from clopidogrel. CABG at 3 days yields comparable outcomes as 5 days, reducing the waiting period.

### Dual antiplatelet therapy with clopidogrel and aspirin versus aspirin monotherapy in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery [^111RhKb7]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

In our study, most of the events of interest occurred within 30 days after CABG, which is similar to previous analysesand indicates that combined antiplatelet therapy may be most beneficial in the early post‐CABG phase when thrombosis plays a predominant role in graft failure. Use of DAPT for 1 to 3 or 6 months followed by conversion to monotherapy with P2Y 12 inhibitors or aspirin, which have been proven safe in patients with ACS and coronary stent implantation, might also be a clinically feasible strategy to avoid potential excess bleeding in the CABG population. However, no specific study has examined the optimal treatment duration of DAPT after CABG, although an arbitrary 1‐year treatment has been suggested for ACS and off‐pump patients. The optimal dose of DAPT and the appropriate postoperative initiation time require further investigation.

Several limitations of our analysis should be considered. First, as an observational study, the analyses are subject to selection bias, and residual unmeasured confounding may persist despite adjustment for a variety of known patient variables using propensity scores to approximate randomization. Second, our study was based on the experience of a single high‐volume center. The conclusions may be influenced by patient referral patterns and local medical management, and therefore may not generalize to the larger CABG population. Third, detailed data on discontinuation time and on‐treatment duration were unavailable for the present analyses, which were based on the intention‐to‐treat principle, and we were unable to conduct time‐dependent Cox regression analyses to account for the impact of the variation in DAPT exposure over time on the association of interest. Instead, we delineated the proportion of "on‐treatment" participants in the 2 groups at discharge and at 6 months. We observed a high rate of DAPT discontinuation, but the reasons were not documented in patient records. Nevertheless, noncompliance should favor a type II error, which cannot explain the findings of the present study. Fourth, the 6‐month event rates in our analysis were lower than those in previous studies. One potential explanation is that our study population tended to be younger and had fewer coexisting conditions. However, we cannot exclude the possibility of underreporting, although this is unlikely because a standardized case report form was used for the adjudication of all events and careful study oversight of outcomes; we anticipate that any problems would have impacted both groups equally. Fifth, low clopidogrel responsiveness has been reported in up to 30% of patients, but we were unable to consider this information in our study because of lack of data on the platelet function test and CYP2C19 gene polymorphisms. Finally, novel P2Y 12 inhibitors (eg, ticagrelor) were not widely prescribed for patients with CABG in our center during the study period; therefore, the results of this study cannot be translated to patients given these agents.

### Impact of clopidogrel in patients with acute coronary syndromes requiring coronary artery bypass surgery: a multicenter analysis [^111Ggop5]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2008). Low credibility.

Objectives

The purpose of our multicenter study was to examine the impact of pre-operative administration of clopidogrel on reoperation rates, incidence of life-threatening bleeding, inpatient length of stay, and other bleeding-related outcomes in acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients requiring cardiopulmonary bypass (coronary artery bypass graft surgery [CABG]) in a broad cross section of U.S. hospitals.

Background

There is relative uncertainty about the relationship between clopidogrel and CABG-associated outcomes in the setting of ACS.

Methods

A retrospective cohort analysis was performed of randomly selected ACS patients requiring CABG in 14 hospitals across the U.S. Patients exposed to clopidogrel were compared with those not exposed to clopidogrel within 5 days prior to surgery.

Results

Of the 596 patients enrolled in the study, 298 had been exposed to clopidogrel within 5 days (Group A). Patients in Group A were more than 3-fold more likely to require reoperation for assessment of bleeding than patients not exposed to clopidogrel (6.4% vs. 1.7% Group B, p = 0.004). Major bleeding occurred in 35% of Group A patients versus 26% of Group B patients (p = 0.049). Length of stay was greater in Group A compared with Group B (9.7 ± 6.0 days vs. 8.6 ± 4.7 days, unadjusted p = 0.016). After logistic regression analysis, clopidogrel exposure within 5 days of CABG was the strongest predictor of reoperation (odds ratio [OR]: 4.60, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.45 to 14.55) and major bleeding (OR: 1.824, 95% CI: 1.106 to 3.008).

Conclusions

After ACS, patients who undergo CABG within 5 days of receiving clopidogrel are at increased risk for reoperation, major bleeding, and increased length of stay. These risks must be balanced by the clinical benefits of clopidogrel use demonstrated in randomized clinical trials.

### Clopidogrel treatment before coronary artery bypass graft surgery increases postoperative morbidity and blood product requirements [^113Pzskk]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2008). Low credibility.

Objectives

An increasing number of patients are referred for coronary artery bypass graft surgery while treated with clopidogrel. This agent inhibits the platelet P2Y12 adenosine-5'-diphosphate (ADP) receptor, which results in an inhibition of platelet aggregation. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of preoperative clopidogrel treatment on postoperative bleeding, mortality, and morbidity in patients after coronary artery bypass graft surgery.

Design

Retrospective cohort study.

Setting

University hospital (single institution).

Participants

One hundred forty-four patients who underwent isolated coronary artery bypass graft surgery.

Interventions

Seventy-two patients who received clopidogrel during the preoperative period formed the study group. Seventy-two patients (matched based on age, sex, and preoperative risk profile) served as the control group.

Measurements and Main Results

Clopidogrel-treated patients received significantly more platelet (4.4 ± 5.7 v 1.3 ± 3.2 U, p < 0.001) and red blood cell (5.1 ± 4.2 v 2.6 ± 2.6 U, p < 0.001) transfusions compared with the control group. All-cause mortality and morbidity were significantly higher in clopidogrel-treated patients (n = 7, 9% v n = 1, 1%; p = 0.031). In addition, the lengths of stay in the intensive care unit and the hospital were significantly longer in these patients (2.5 ± 2.7 v 1.4 ± 0.9 days, p = 0.002; 9.9 ± 11 v 6 ± 2.5 days, p = 0.003). Despite an increased morbidity in the clopidogrel group, the midterm survival was similar between the 2 groups (1-year and 5-year survival 97% ± 2% and 95.7% ± 3% v 100% ± 0% and 87% ± 10%, respectively; p = 0.885).

Conclusions

Preoperative clopidogrel is associated with increased transfusion requirement after coronary artery bypass graft surgery. The present data suggest that all-cause mortality and major morbidity may also increase in these patients. In clopidogrel-treated patients, coronary artery bypass graft surgery should be delayed in the absence of specific medical indications as recommended by recent American Heart Association guidelines.

### Clopidogrel and bleeding after coronary artery bypass graft surgery [^114syWBt]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

Background

There is evidence that clopidogrel (with or without aspirin) confers superior outcomes in patients with coronary artery disease. The purpose of this study is to review the effect of preoperative clopidogrel administration on clinical outcome, bleeding complications and resource utilization after coronary artery bypass graft surgery.

Methods

Patient data were prospectively collected from 919 patients who had isolated coronary surgery during the period 2000 to 2003. Outcome comparisons were studied, firstly between patients who received preoperative clopidogrel with those who did not, and secondly between patients on clopidogrel only, aspirin only, both or neither medications.

Results

Twenty-four patients (2.6%) were on clopidogrel only, 598 (65.1%) were on aspirin only, 61 (6.6%) were on both, and 236 (25.7%) were on neither. Clopidogrel (n = 85) versus no clopidogrel (n = 834): there were no significant differences in the off-pump patients. In the on-pump patients, the clopidogrel group had significantly increased bleeding (p = 0.02), blood transfused (p = 0.01), intensive care (p = 0.03), and hospital stays (p = 0.03). There were no significant differences in surgical reexploration, perioperative myocardial infarction, intraoperative balloon pump use, inotropic support or 30-day mortality. Clopidogrel versus aspirin versus both versus neither: patients on both clopidogrel and aspirin had significantly more postoperative bleeding than patients on aspirin alone or on neither medication.

Conclusions

The preoperative use of clopidogrel in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery showed limited clinical benefits; however, its use significantly increased the risk of bleeding, blood transfusion, and resource utilization.

Regarding perioperative care for coronary artery disease, more specifically with respect to periprocedural antiplatelet therapy, for CABG, ACC/AHA/SCAI 2022 guidelines recommend to do not use aspirin (100–300 mg daily) in the immediate preoperative period (< 24 hours before surgery) in patients undergoing elective CABG not already taking aspirin.

### Coronary artery bypass grafting-related bleeding complications in patients treated with ticagrelor or clopidogrel: a nationwide study [^114FbJun]. European Heart Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with acetylsalicylic acid and a P2Y 12 -receptor antagonist reduces the risk of thrombotic complications compared with treatment with only acetylsalicylic acid in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS). The risk of thrombotic complications is further reduced if one of the new more potent platelet inhibitors, ticagrelor or prasugrel, is used instead of clopidogrel, but the risk of both spontaneous and surgical bleeding complications may increase with the new inhibitors.

Major bleeding complications impair outcome after cardiac surgery. Acute coronary syndrome patients on DAPT who need acute or urgent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) are at high risk of major bleeding. Current revascularization guidelines therefore recommend that clopidogrel and ticagrelor are discontinued 5 days before surgery and prasugrel 7 days before elective surgery, but the patient's condition may render this impossible. Most ACS patients are hospitalized while waiting for CABG. If a shorter discontinuation time of the platelet inhibitor would be safe from a bleeding perspective, it would reduce the risk of thrombotic complications during the waiting time, and save hospital resources. The risk of bleeding complications in relation to discontinuation time has not previously been investigated in real life in sufficiently large patient cohorts.

The newer and more potent platelet inhibitors may increase the risk of major CABG-related bleeding complications, but it is unclear whether the incidence differs between ticagrelor and clopidogrel in real life after adjustment for time since discontinuation and other factors that influence bleeding risk.

The aims of the present real-life study were to investigate whether a shorter discontinuation time before surgery increases the risk of major bleeding with ticagrelor or clopidogrel and to compare the unadjusted and adjusted incidence of CABG-related bleeding complications between clopidogrel and ticagrelor.

Antiplatelet therapy in patients undergoing CABG — ACC/AHA/SCAI recommendations: In patients undergoing CABG who are already taking daily aspirin preoperatively, it is recommended that they continue taking aspirin until the time of surgery to reduce ischemic events (1 B-R). In patients referred for urgent CABG, clopidogrel and ticagrelor should be discontinued for at least 24 hours before surgery to reduce major bleeding complications (1 B-NR). In patients undergoing CABG, discontinuation of short-acting glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors (eptifibatide and tirofiban) for 4 hours and abciximab for 12 hours before surgery is recommended to reduce the risk of bleeding and transfusion (1 B-NR). In patients undergoing elective CABG who receive P2Y12 receptor inhibitors before surgery, it is reasonable to discontinue clopidogrel for 5 days, ticagrelor for 3 days, and prasugrel for 7 days before CABG to reduce risk of major bleeding and blood product transfusion (2a B-NR). In patients undergoing elective CABG who are not already taking aspirin, the initiation of aspirin (in 100–300 mg daily) in the immediate preoperative period (< 24 hours before surgery) is not recommended (3: No benefit B-R).

### Comparison of outcomes and costs associated with aspirin ± clopidogrel after coronary artery bypass grafting [^115FpaZV]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2018). Low credibility.

Optimal antiplatelet therapy after coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery remains controversial. This study evaluated the role of dual antiplatelet therapy using aspirin and clopidogrel (DAPT) versus antiplatelet therapy using aspirin only (ASA) on post-CABG clinical outcomes and costs. In the Department of Veterans Affairs Randomized On/Off Bypass (ROOBY) trial, clopidogrel use after CABG was prospectively collected beginning in year 2 of this study to include 1,525 of the 2,203 original ROOBY patients who received aspirin after CABG. Discretionarily, surgeons after CABG administered either DAPT or ASA treatments. The ROOBY trial's primary 30-day composite (mortality or perioperative morbidity), 1-year composite (all-cause death, repeat revascularization, or nonfatal myocardial infarction), and costs were compared for these 2 strategies. Of the 1,525 subjects, 511 received DAPT and 1,014 received ASA. DAPT subjects, compared with ASA subjects, had lower rates of preoperative left ventricular ejection fraction of ≥ 45% (78.8% vs 85.7%, p < 0.001), on-pump CABG (36.6% vs 57.1%, p = 0.001), and endoscopic vein harvesting (30.0% vs 42.8%, p < 0.001). ASA patients were more likely to have earlier aspirin administration and receive 325 versus 81mg dosages. The 30-day composite outcome rate was significantly lower for DAPT patients compared with ASA patients (3.3% vs 7.1%, p = 0.003), but the 1-year composite outcome was equal between the 2 groups (12.0% vs12.0%, p = 1.0). At 1 year, there were no cost differences between the 2 groups. Propensity analyses did not significantly alter the results. In conclusion, DAPT appeared safe and was associated with fewer 30-day adverse outcomes than aspirin only and with no 1-year outcome or cost differences.

### Antithrombotic treatment after coronary artery bypass graft surgery: systematic review and network meta-analysis [^115V3ayw]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

Results

Data selection

Our systematic search identified 3266 citations published between 1979 and 2019. Of these, we included 21 articlesthat related to 20 unique parallel group randomised controlled trials in the network meta-analysis. These trials comprised 4803 participants and investigated nine different interventions (eight active and one placebo) (fig 1); three trials had three eligible arms and the remaining trials had two eligible arms.

The study sample size ranged from 20 to 1448 patients, patient age ranged from 44 to 83 years, 83% were male, and 83% underwent elective (stable coronary artery disease) surgery. The number of saphenous vein grafts ranged from 1.14 to 3.60 per patient, and drug interventions were started from seven days before coronary artery bypass graft surgery to 14 days after the procedure. The duration of follow-up ranged from one month to eight years. Assessment of saphenous vein graft failure was performed by either invasive angiography or computed tomography (table 1 and supplementary table 1).

Across comparisons, the distribution of baseline characteristics by treatment was generally balanced, except for the type of coronary artery bypass graft technique (on pump versus off pump coronary artery bypass graft), and the timing of drug initiation (table 2). Information on antifibrinolytic use was not reported because of limited data.

### The effect of clopidogrel in combination with aspirin when given before coronary artery bypass grafting [^116TjPRb]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2002). Low credibility.

Objectives

This study was designed to evaluate the effect of preoperative clopidogrel on coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) outcomes.

Background

Clopidogrel in combination with aspirin, given before percutaneous coronary intervention, has become the standard for stent thrombosis prevention. Some premedicated patients, however, are found to have surgical disease on angiography, and irreversible platelet inhibition becomes a concern for upcoming CABG.

Methods

We prospectively studied 224 consecutive patients undergoing nonemergent first-time CABG, and compared those with preoperative clopidogrel exposure within seven days (n = 59) to those without exposure (n = 165).

Results

The groups were comparable in age, gender, body surface area, preoperative hematocrit, preoperative prothrombin time and prior myocardial infarction. The clopidogrel group had higher 24-h mean chest tube output (1,224 mL vs. 840 ml, p = 0.001), and more transfusions of red blood cells (2.51 U vs. 1.74 U, p = 0.036), platelets (0.86 U vs. 0.24 U, p = 0.001) and fresh frozen plasma (0.68 U vs. 0.24 U, p = 0.015). Moreover, reoperation for bleeding was 10-fold higher in the clopidogrel group (6.8% vs. 0.6%, p = 0.018). The clopidogrel group also had less extubation within 8 h (54.2% vs. 75.8%, p = 0.002) and a trend towards less hospital discharge within five days (33.9% vs. 46.7%, p = 0.094).

Conclusions

Clopidogrel in combination with aspirin before CABG is associated with higher postoperative bleeding and morbidity. These findings raise concern regarding the routine administration of clopidogrel before anticipated coronary stent implantation.

### Efficacy of post-operative clopidogrel treatment in patients revascularized with coronary artery bypass grafting after myocardial infarction [^114e5GYo]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2011). Low credibility.

Objectives

The objective of this study was to examine the clinical efficacy of clopidogrel treatment on death and recurrent myocardial infarction (MI) among MI patients revascularized by coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG).

Background

The benefit from post-operative clopidogrel in CABG-treated MI patients is largely unknown.

Methods

All patients admitted with first-time MI between 2002 and 2006, treated with CABG within 180 days after admission, were identified by nationwide administrative registers. Clopidogrel treatment was determined by claimed prescriptions after discharge from surgery. Risk of death or recurrent MI, and of a combined end point of the 2, were assessed by cumulative incidence and Cox proportional hazards model. A propensity score-matched subgroup analysis was done.

Results

We included 3,545 patients, and of these, 957 (27.0%) were treated with clopidogrel after CABG. Mean follow-up was 466 ± 144 days. Among patients treated with clopidogrel, 39 (4.1%) died or experienced a recurrent MI, whereas that occurred in 203 (7.8%) patients without clopidogrel (log-rank p = 0.0003). Hazard ratio was 0.59 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.42 to 0.85) for patients treated with clopidogrel, with no-clopidogrel as reference. By propensity score, of 945 patients with or without clopidogrel treatment who were matched, death or recurrent MI occurred in 38 (4.0%) patients with clopidogrel and 57 (6.0%) without clopidogrel (log-rank p = 0.05). Corresponding hazard ratio was 0.67 (95% CI: 0.44 to 1.00) for clopidogrel users, with no-clopidogrel as reference.

Conclusions

Among MI patients revascularized by CABG, only 27% received clopidogrel after discharge. Clopidogrel-treated patients had a lower risk of the combined end point of death or recurrent MI. Focus on discharge clopidogrel treatment of these patients should be made.

### In-hospital patients exposed to clopidogrel before coronary artery bypass graft surgery: a word of caution [^1118bSKH]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

Background

The aim of our study was to investigate the independent effect of preoperative exposure to aspirin, heparin, and clopidogrel on early clinical outcomes of in-hospital referral patients undergoing first time coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery.

Methods

Outcomes for in-hospital referrals for CABG between January 2001 and January 2002 were prospectively recorded. Exposure to aspirin, heparin, and clopidogrel during the 5 days before surgery was recorded, and their effect on outcome was explored using multiple regression methods. The effect of clopidogrel given within 48 hours before surgery versus stopped at least 48 hours before the operation was also investigated.

Results

In-hospital referral patients represented 40% (473 of 1,185) of the total surgical population; 304 (64.7%) were prescribed aspirin, 116 (24.7%) heparin, 91 (19.4%) clopidogrel, and 133 (28.3%) had all anticoagulants stopped 5 days before surgery. In-hospital mortality was 2.3% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.1 to 4.1) and was highest among those exposed to clopidogrel (odds ratio 16.9, 95% CI: 2.10 to 136, p = 0.008). Seven of the 11 deaths occurred in patients given clopidogrel. Postoperative intraaortic balloon pump, arrhythmia, reintubation, and stroke were all significantly more common when clopidogrel was prescribed (relative risk estimates all greater than 1.5, p values all ≤ 0.021). Blood loss was 37% higher in the patients given clopidogrel (95% CI: +3% to +82%, p = 0.033). Clopidogrel patients were more likely to need a reoperation for bleeding (p < 0.001) and require transfusions (p ≤ 0.015). Intubation time and hospital stay were also longer (p = 0.021 and p = 0.019, respectively). Heparin was also associated with longer hospital stay (p < 0.001) and aspirin use with reduced stay (p = 0.041), but for all other outcomes, no association with aspirin or heparin use was found. Comparison of subgroups of clopidogrel patients suggested mortality was highest when clopidogrel was given in the 48 hours before surgery.

Conclusions

Our study suggests that among in-hospital referral patients, preoperative exposure to clopidogrel within 5 days before CABG may increase early mortality and morbidity, and that the mortality risk is greatest when the drug is given within 48 hours of surgery.

### Dual antiplatelet therapy with clopidogrel and aspirin versus aspirin monotherapy in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery [^11718Ncm]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this large cohort study comparing outcomes of DAPT with aspirin monotherapy in patients undergoing isolated CABG, the use of DAPT was associated with significantly lower risk of a composite outcome of death, myocardial infarction, stroke, or repeat revascularization as well as 3 individual components of the outcome — death, myocardial infarction, and stroke — at 6 months after the surgery. The association was apparent across clinically important subgroups, including patients with preoperative ACS or stable angina, those with or without diabetes mellitus, and those who underwent on‐pump or off‐pump bypass. There was no evidence of a higher risk of major bleeding among patients who received DAPT.

Inhibition of platelet activation and aggregation is crucial for maintaining graft patency and improving outcomes for patients with CABG, especially considering the continued popularity of saphenous vein grafts as the secondary bypass conduit supplement to the left internal mammary artery.DAPT with a P2Y 12 inhibitor added to aspirin is an appealing secondary prevention strategy for patients who had CABG because its potent synergistic antithrombotic effects might help to overcome resistance to aspirin and prevent thrombosis in grafts, native coronary arteries, and even cerebrovascular arteries. A recent randomized controlled trial that compared the effect of ticagrelor plus aspirin versus aspirin alone on saphenous vein graft patencyand 3 comprehensive meta‐analyses incorporating data from both randomized controlled trials and observational studies, found that adding a P2Y 12 inhibitor (clopidogrel or ticagrelor) to aspirin after CABG reduced the risk of saphenous vein graft failure. However, this benefit was not confirmed in another newly published randomized study on the same topic.

### Comparison of dual antiplatelet therapies after coronary endarterectomy combined with coronary artery bypass grafting: a cohort study [^112H2YuE]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Coronary endarterectomy (CE) for the treatment of advanced coronary artery disease can be traced back to 1950s. Before long, it became an adjunctive way to coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) in patients with diffuse coronary artery disease that could not be achieved complete revascularization by CABG or coronary stenting alone. Unfortunately, early results from clinical studies were frustrating. In contrast, studies reported improved clinical outcomes after CE + CABG during last two decades, and this might be attributed to the improvement in operative techniques and postoperative antithrombotic therapy. However, controversies still exist.

Thrombosis is the major cause of early graft occlusion, and this can lead to poor patient prognosis. Activation of platelet function and even coagulation cascade can occur due to the traumatic stress, blood loss and cardiopulmonary bypass during CABG, and this can last up to more than 1 month, making antithrombotic treatment particularly important. One of the fatal shortcomings of CE is the loss of intima, which causes direct exposure of sub-endothelial tissue to blood flow, resulting in increased platelet aggregation and activation of coagulation cascade. In other words, there might be more chances of thrombosis after CE + CABG compared to CABG alone. Therefore, more active postoperative antithrombotic therapy might be required after CE + CABG.

Clinical guidelines recommend that patients should receive dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) for 12 months after CABG. Aspirin plus clopidogrel therapy is the conventional DAPT protocol. However, due to the diversity of drug reactions, sufficient platelet inhibition cannot be achieved in 10 to 63% of patients with clopidogrel. Ticagrelor, a new P2Y12 receptor antagonist, can achieve stronger and faster platelet inhibition with safe clinical outcomes, and there's no drug reaction diversity when compared with clopidogrel. Currently clinical guideline from the European Society of Cardiology recommended both clopidogrel and ticagrelor for DAPT in patients with coronary artery disease. However, there's no consistent antiplatelet therapy protocol after CE + CABG. Several studies existed. Marco Russo and colleagues reported that no significant difference was observed between single antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and DAPT with aspirin plus clopidogrel after CE + CABG, although the study was limited with small sample size. Several studies involved anticoagulation or antiplatelet therapy after CE + CABG, but without comparing different protocols. Therefore, more evidence on antithrombotic therapy after CE + CABG is needed.

Coronary artery bypass grafting-related risk on ticagrelor

Ticagrelor is a direct-acting and reversible inhibitor of the P2Y 12 receptor and is additionally an inhibitor of adenosine reuptake. Like prasugrel, ticagrelor has a more rapid and consistent onset of action compared with clopidogrel leading to a better outcome in ACS patients, irrespective of revascularization strategies, including a mortality benefit. Ticagrelor (180-mg loading dose, 90 mg twice daily) is recommended for all patients at moderate-to-high risk of ischaemic events, regardless of initial treatment strategy and including those pretreated with clopidogrel. In addition, it has a more rapid and consistent offset of action related to its reversible receptor binding and plasma half-life of 6–12 h. In patients with stable CAD, recovery of platelet aggregation is almost complete at 5 days after cessation of ticagrelor, with substantially more recovery than seen with good responders to clopidogrel. For patients in the PLATO study who underwent CABG surgery within 7 days of the last dose of study medication, there was evidence of early mortality reduction in the ticagrelor group and this was accounted for by fewer deaths associated with bleeding and infection as well as ischaemic events (4.6 vs. 9.2%; P = 0.0018).

The strategies to reduce bleeding during CABG surgery have been added as.

DAPT adherence — revascularization choice in multivessel coronary artery disease (CAD): In patients with multivessel CAD amenable to percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) who cannot access, tolerate, or adhere to dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) for the appropriate duration, CABG is reasonable in preference to PCI (COR 2a, LOE B-NR). Premature cessation of DAPT after PCI is associated with stent thrombosis and poor outcomes, including death; therefore, PCI is not favored as the mode of revascularization among patients manifesting risk factors for poor adherence. Stent thrombosis after PCI has death rates as high as 50% for early thrombosis cases, and early DAPT interruption is associated with a relative increase in stent thrombosis rates between 2-fold and > 20-fold; given these risks, CABG is a safe revascularization option in patients who are not likely to be adherent to DAPT.

### Ticagrelor versus clopidogrel in patients with acute coronary syndromes undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery: results from the PLATO (platelet inhibition and patient outcomes) trial [^112GtJpb]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2011). Low credibility.

Objectives

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor and clopidogrel in patients with acute coronary syndrome undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG), as a post-randomization strategy.

Background

Ticagrelor is a novel, reversibly binding, oral, direct-acting P2Y(12)-receptor antagonist. In the PLATO (Platelet Inhibition and Patient Outcomes) trial, which randomized 18,624 patients with acute coronary syndromes, ticagrelor compared with clopidogrel significantly reduced the risk of the primary composite end point of cardiovascular (CV) death, myocardial infarction, or stroke (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.84; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.77 to 0.92; p < 0.001). This report investigated the outcomes of patients treated with CABG during the trial.

Methods

In total, 1,899 patients underwent CABG post-randomization. The protocol recommended ticagrelor/placebo to be withheld for 24 to 72 h and clopidogrel/placebo for 5 days preoperatively. In all, 1,261 patients underwent CABG and were receiving study drug treatment < 7 days before surgery. The statistical analysis was based on events occurring from the CABG procedure until the end of the study, excluding 3 patients with CABG after study end.

Results

In the 1,261 patient cohort, the relative reduction of primary composite end point at 12 months (10.6% [66 of 629] with ticagrelor versus 13.1% [79 of 629] with clopidogrel; HR: 0.84; 95% CI: 0.60 to 1.16; p = 0.29) was consistent with the results of the whole trial. Total mortality was reduced from 9.7% (58 of 629) to 4.7% (29 of 629; HR: 0.49; 95% CI: 0.32 to 0.77; p < 0.01), CV death from 7.9% (47 of 629) to 4.1% (25 of 629; HR: 0.52; 95% CI: 0.32 to 0.85; p < 0.01), and non-CV death numerically from 2.0% to 0.7% (p = 0.07). There was no significant difference in CABG-related major bleeding between the randomized treatments.

Conclusions

In the subgroup of patients undergoing CABG within 7 days after the last study drug intake, ticagrelor compared with clopidogrel was associated with a substantial reduction in total and CV mortality without excess risk of CABG-related bleeding.

### Different antithrombotic strategies after coronary artery bypass grafting to prevent adverse events: a retrospective analysis [^1144UHad]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Antiplatelet therapy is a major strategy to prevent post-CABG failure and adverse events. While aspirin therapy after CABG has been proven to be a safe approach to improve vein graft patency and reduce adverse events, there have been no dedicated large-scale studies in the CABG population to support postoperative dual antiplatelet therapy. Continuation of DAPT before the surgery increases the risk of excessive perioperative bleeding, transfusions, and re-exploration for bleeding, which suggests the likelihood of a high risk of bleeding in postoperative DAPT patients. In a meta-analysis of 20,315 patients, DAPT (as compared to single antiplatelet therapy) was associated with reduced cardiovascular mortality in observational studies, but not in randomized trials or in patients with stable ischemic heart disease. Additionally, DAPT was correlated with an increased risk for major bleeding in that study. The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Guideline Focused Update on Duration of Dual Antiplatelet Therapy in Patients with Coronary Artery Disease issued recommendations to utilize DAPT over SAPT in patients following CABG in 2016. Another meta-analysis showed increased vein graft patency with DAPT, but increased postoperative bleeding was also noted. Current guidelines recommend postoperative DAPT based upon the stability of coronary artery disease prior to CABG. In 2017, F. Biancari et al. proposed a Will-Bleed score to evaluate the risk of severe bleeding after CABG. Seven parameters with different weights were included in this model: preoperative anemia, female gender, eGFR, potent antiplatelet drugs discontinued less than five days, critical preoperative state, ACS, and use of LMWH/fondaparinux/unfractionated heparin. This risk score simplified the evaluating process and showed optimistic ability for prediction.

### To pretreat or not to pretreat (with oral P2Y12 antagonists)? That is the question [^111nkuo5]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

As new developments in P2Y12 inhibitors have led to increased potency, reversible platelet binding, and even the ability to administer a P2Y12 medication intravenously with rapid onset, in‐hospital care of patients undergoing early coronary angiography and revascularization has also continued to evolve. Patients now frequently undergo coronary angiography within the first 24 to 48 hours of hospitalization; data from the ACTION Registry suggest that ≈60% of patients undergo coronary angiography within 48 hours. 18 In this setting, the benefit of pretreatment with P2Y12 therapy before coronary angiography that was observed in the CURE trial, where coronary angiography occurred a median of 10 days from presentation, 4 may no longer be directly applicable. A subanalysis of the CURE trial, however, argues against this. It showed that the benefits of clopidogrel began within hours of randomization with a statistically significant benefit between groups in the first 24 hours, which was largely driven by reduction of in‐hospital refractory ischemia. 6 Nonetheless, the benefit of pretreatment must be balanced with the possible delays and increased bleeding risks associated with a surgical revascularization.

A number of other important points must also be considered. Many patients do not undergo early coronary angiography and would miss the early benefit of P2Y12 inhibitor observed in CURE. Furthermore, only 11% to 13% of patients admitted with NSTEMI will ultimately be found to have anatomy that necessitates CABG. 19 With a low rate of CABG and the benefits observed with P2Y12 pretreatment, perhaps it is better to tolerate the inherent surgical delays and bleeding risks associated with P2Y12 pretreatment in the small subset of patients who ultimately undergo CABG, rather than to miss the benefits of P2Y12 pretreatment for all patients. Finally, management of additional factors that are more strongly associated with CABG‐related bleeding than the use and timing of P2Y12 inhibitors may also afford a better balance of benefit and risk for early use of P2Y12 inhibitors among patients requiring CABG. Whereas medications presurgery are an important factor to consider when evaluating bleeding risk, it is essential to also recognize that numerous other variables contribute to bleeding, including patient age, sex, renal function, the surgeon who performs the procedure, and the definition of bleeding that is used. 20

### Aspirin plus clopidogrel versus aspirin alone after coronary artery bypass grafting: the clopidogrel after surgery for coronary artery disease (CASCADE) trial [^115J79Sb]. Circulation (2010). Low credibility.

Background

clopidogrel inhibits intimal hyperplasia in animal studies and therefore may reduce saphenous vein graft (SVG) intimal hyperplasia after coronary artery bypass grafting. The Clopidogrel After Surgery for Coronary Artery DiseasE (CASCADE) study was undertaken to evaluate whether the addition of clopidogrel to aspirin inhibits SVG disease after coronary artery bypass grafting, as assessed at 1 year by intravascular ultrasound.

Methods and Results

in this double-blind phase II trial, 113 patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting with SVGs were randomized to receive aspirin 162 mg plus clopidogrel 75 mg daily or aspirin 162 mg plus placebo daily for 1 year. The primary outcome was SVG intimal hyperplasia (mean intimal area) as determined by intravascular ultrasound at 1 year. Secondary outcomes were graft patency, major adverse cardiovascular events, and major bleeding. One-year intravascular ultrasound and coronary angiography were performed in 92 patients (81.4%). At 1 year, SVG intimal area did not differ significantly between the 2 groups (4.1 ± 2.0 versus 4.5 ± 2.1 mm(2), aspirin-clopidogrel versus aspirin-placebo, P = 0.44). Overall 1-year graft patency was 95.2% in the aspirin-clopidogrel group compared with 95.5% in the aspirin-placebo group (P = 0.90), and SVG patency was 94.3% in the aspirin-clopidogrel group versus 93.2% in the aspirin-placebo group (P = 0.69). Freedom from major adverse cardiovascular events at 1 year was 92.9 ± 3.4% in the aspirin-clopidogrel group and 91.1 ± 3.8% in the aspirin-placebo group (P = 0.76). The incidence of major bleeding at 1 year was similar for the 2 groups (1.8% versus 0%, aspirin-clopidogrel versus aspirin-placebo, P = 0.50).

Conclusions

compared with aspirin monotherapy, the combination of aspirin plus clopidogrel did not significantly reduce the process of SVG intimal hyperplasia 1 year after coronary artery bypass grafting.

Risk of bias and certainty of evidence

We judged two randomised controlled trialsto have a high risk of bias arising from the randomisation process and five randomised controlled trialsto have a high risk of bias because of missing outcome data (supplementary table 7). Five of the trialshad some concerns about measurement of the outcome and three randomised controlled trialshad some concerns about bias from selective reporting of outcomes. We judged only five unique trialsto have a low risk of bias due to deviation from intended interventions. Overall, we judged eight trials (40%)to have a high risk of bias, primarily owing to failure to blind and missing outcome data. Of trials reporting incomplete outcome data, 10 trialsperformed intention to treat analysis, and two of theseclearly reported the use of intention to treat analysis with worst case assumptions for imputation of missing data. It was unclear how the remaining trials with incomplete data handled missing outcome data.

Figure 3 (top panel) also provides the certainty of evidence of network estimates for saphenous vein graft failure. We downgraded evidence certainty to low or very low for most comparisons, mainly because of study limitations owing to incomplete outcome data, imprecision, indirectness, and the possibility of intransitivity. Supplementary tables 8 and 9 summarise certainty of evidence for direct, indirect, and network estimates. The network evidence for dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin plus ticagrelor and aspirin plus clopidogrel was of moderate certainty compared with aspirin monotherapy. The symmetrical comparison adjusted funnel plot shows neither evidence of publication bias for placebo controlled trials nor small study effects (supplementary figure 1). When we performed a sensitivity analysis that excluded studies considered at serious risk of bias, the effect estimates did not change substantially, except for aspirin plus clopidogrel versus vitamin K antagonist, which became non-significant (supplementary figure 2).

We also downgraded the certainty of evidence to low or very low for most comparisons of clinical outcomes, including major bleeding, myocardial infarction, and mortality (fig 3, bottom panel, fig 5, and supplementary tables 8 and 9). However, comparisons with moderate certainty evidence should be interpreted with caution mainly because of inconsistency and publication bias. We could not thoroughly assess inconsistency because many of the comparisons consisted of a single study. Additionally, we could not assess publication bias for secondary outcomes because this network meta-analysis was designed to exclude studies that did not evaluate our primary efficacy outcome (saphenous vein graft failure), regardless of reported secondary outcomes (supplementary tables 8 and 9).

### Dual antiplatelet therapy with clopidogrel and aspirin versus aspirin monotherapy in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery [^116fyX6J]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

To our knowledge, the present study is the largest to date to principally investigate the association between DAPT and clinical outcomes in a contemporary CABG population. Our findings suggest that post‐CABG DAPT with clopidogrel is an effective and safe secondary prevention regimen that can improve patient outcomes. We found a 39% reduction in mortality among patients treated with DAPT, an effect similar to 2 thorough meta‐analyses. This improvement in survival could be the cumulative result of better graft patency, as previously demonstrated, and supported by the lower incidences of myocardial infarction and cardiovascular death in the current analysis, and potential pleiotropic benefits of clopidogrel. Additionally, for the first time, we observed a 50% lower risk of stroke at 6 months after CABG for patients taking DAPT with clopidogrel versus aspirin monotherapy. This finding is consistent with a trial of 5170 patients with recent transient ischemic attack or minor stroke that showed a combination of clopidogrel and aspirin was superior to aspirin alone in reducing the risk of stroke. Collectively, the findings indicate that post‐CABG DAPT contributed to a significantly lower risk of MACCE when compared with aspirin monotherapy.

In this study, the addition of clopidogrel to aspirin was associated with a risk of major bleeding that was comparable to aspirin monotherapy. This result was not unexpected given the conservative daily dose of DAPT (clopidogrel 75 mg plus aspirin 100 mg), relatively young and healthy patient population, and strict definitions of major bleeding. We developed a composite major bleeding outcome of roughly similar severity to the composite ischemic outcome to aid clinicians in evaluating the risk/benefit tradeoff of antiplatelet therapy, but omitting other minor bleeding events. Notably, previous studies indicated that DAPT was more likely to introduce minor bleeding rather than major bleeding requiring surgical intervention or intense hospitalization care, and a lower‐than‐expected incidence of major bleeding under current definitions may have biased the result toward the null. In addition, the low number of major bleeding events precluded evaluation of the impact of DAPT in patients at higher risk for bleeding, such as those of older age, with diabetes mellitus, or with renal dysfunction.

### Antithrombotic treatment after coronary artery bypass graft surgery: systematic review and network meta-analysis [^114YJP37]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Coronary artery bypass graft surgery is the preferred treatment for many patients with multivessel coronary artery disease. However, patients undergoing this procedure remain at risk of subsequent major adverse cardiovascular events, mainly caused by associated progression of native coronary artery disease, vascular damage, or saphenous vein graft failure. Previous studies have shown rates of saphenous vein graft failure of up to 30–40% in the first yearand up to 70% beyond 10 years after coronary artery bypass graft surgery. Despite its relatively high early failure rates, saphenous vein graft remains the most commonly used graft in contemporary coronary artery bypass graft trials.

Aspirin is considered the preferred antiplatelet drug to prevent saphenous vein graft failure after coronary artery bypass graft (class I, level of evidence A). Updated meta-analyses support this recommendation, but at a cost of increasing the risk of bleeding. Uncertainty remains about the benefits of adding a P2Y12 inhibitor or oral anticoagulant to aspirin monotherapy. There is emerging evidence on the potential benefits of dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel or ticagrelor after coronary artery bypass graft surgery, but these combinations have not been directly compared with other antithrombotic therapies in randomised controlled trials. Additionally, no studies have been published to compare the effects of all available oral antithrombotic drugs (antiplatelets and anticoagulants) for the prevention of saphenous vein graft failure after coronary artery bypass graft surgery within a single analytical framework. Therefore, in this study we aimed to systematically review randomised controlled trials that assessed the effects of oral antithrombotic drugs to prevent saphenous vein graft failure in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery. We also evaluated the comparative efficacy and harms of these drugs by using a network meta-analysis.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2021). High credibility.

Stable ischemic heart disease (SIHD) with prior percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) — for patients on antiplatelet therapy (APT), if it has been ≤ 6 months since PCI, our recommendation for most patients would be to stop aspirin, continue clopidogrel, and start an oral anticoagulant (OAC) (with preference given to a direct oral anticoagulant [DOAC]); if it has been 6 to 12 months since PCI, we recommend continuing single antiplatelet therapy (SAPT) with either aspirin or clopidogrel until 1 year post-PCI, along with an OAC; for > 12 months post-PCI, OAC alone can be used long-term. For patients after coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery, we recommend continuing aspirin (< 100 mg/day) if < 1 year post-CABG surgery and stopping aspirin > 1 year post-CABG surgery. For SIHD patients on SAPT with no history of an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and no prior revascularization who develop AF requiring OAC therapy, the appropriate management is nearly always to stop APT and start an OAC.

### Aspirin combined with clopidogrel (plavix) decreases… [^113pw5ri]. AAFP (2007). Low credibility.

2 Nearly 700, 000 Americans die from heart disease each year, which accounts for 29 percent of all deaths in the United States. 3 Standard risk reduction measures, including lipid lowering, blood pressure control, and aspirin therapy, reduce morbidity and mortality in patients at higher risk of cardiovascular disease. Compared with placebo, low-dose aspirin reduces the risk of nonfatal stroke by 25 percent in patients at high risk of occlusive vascular events, such as those with acute or previous vascular disease or other predisposing conditions. 4 Clopidogrel improves outcomes in patients with recent coronary artery stent placement. 5 Prior to this study, it was unclear whether combination therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel was superior to aspirin alone in high-risk groups. Cochrane Abstract Background: Aspirin is the prophylactic antiplatelet drug of choice for persons with cardiovascular disease.

However, protection with anti-platelet therapy in persons with a high risk of cardiovascular disease is unsatisfactory in absolute terms. Adding a second antiplatelet drug to aspirin may produce additional benefit for those at high risk and those with established cardiovascular disease. The use of clopidogrel plus aspirin, compared with placebo plus aspirin, was associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular events and a higher risk of major bleeding. Overall, we would expect 13 cardiovascular events to be prevented for every 1, 000 patients treated with the combination, but six major bleeds would be caused. Treatment effects differed in the two trials. The CURE trial, confined to persons with acute non-ST segment coronary syndromes, showed definite evidence of benefit from treatment.

For every 1, 000 persons treated for an average of nine months, 23 events would be avoided and 10 major bleeds would be caused. In the CHARISMA trial that randomized persons at high cardiovascular risk defined in terms of pre-existing cardiovascular diseases or risk factors, the effects of treatment were less marked and were consistent with the play of chance. For every 1, 000 persons treated for an average of 28 months, five cardiovascular events would be avoided and three major bleeds would be caused.
