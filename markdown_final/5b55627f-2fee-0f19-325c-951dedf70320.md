## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the Cox-Maze procedure for atrial fibrillation. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the historical evolution and the core principles that define a true Cox-Maze. Then, I should verify the comparative efficacy of Cox-Maze III versus Cox-Maze IV and how ablation technology changed outcomes. Next, I will examine randomized and observational evidence for concomitant use during mitral valve surgery, including safety and rhythm outcomes. After that, I should review stand-alone Cox-Maze IV data and how it compares with catheter ablation. I will then consider special populations, predictors of failure, and guideline recommendations. Finally, I need to appraise limitations and synthesize a practical, patient-centered recommendation with appropriate caveats and citations.

> Let me first confirm the foundational concepts and nomenclature so I don't mislabel procedures. The Cox-Maze operation is a biatrial lesion set designed to interrupt macroreentrant circuits, isolate the pulmonary veins and posterior left atrium, preserve atrial transport function, and exclude the left atrial appendage; only a full biatrial lesion set should be called a "Maze", whereas limited sets are surgical AF ablation rather than a true Maze, and this distinction is emphasized in contemporary consensus statements [^f5c9e381] [^133028b1] [^889626a0].

> I need to check the historical evolution carefully. Cox-Maze III used cut-and-sew incisions and set the early benchmark for durability, but its complexity limited adoption; Cox-Maze IV replaced most incisions with bipolar radiofrequency and cryoablation, shortening cross-clamp and pump times while aiming to replicate the same lesion set, and multiple series show similar early success to Cox-Maze III with shorter operative times, which helps explain broader contemporary use [^560127cf] [^36abb7e5] [^a0dbe251].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about equivalence without data. I should confirm long-term outcomes. Large Cox-Maze IV cohorts demonstrate approximately 78% freedom from AF at 5 years and about 66% off antiarrhythmic drugs, with durable results across paroxysmal and persistent AF phenotypes; this aligns with the principle that transmural, contiguous lesions and posterior LA isolation are key to success [^6e604af9] [^e82e3fd7].

> Next, I should review the randomized evidence for concomitant Cox-Maze during mitral valve surgery, because that's where practice variation is greatest. Multiple meta-analyses of RCTs show that adding Cox-Maze to mitral valve surgery significantly increases sinus rhythm at discharge, 6 months, and 12 months without increasing mortality, stroke, or thromboembolism, though pacemaker risk can be higher in some series and cross-clamp times are longer; pooled estimates suggest roughly 67% sinus rhythm off drugs at 12 months versus about 21% without ablation, which is clinically meaningful [^9bcd5e12] [^a1d641aa] [^1680ab47] [^e7193891].

> Wait, let me verify the pacemaker signal because it's easy to overgeneralize. Some RCTs and meta-analyses show no significant difference in permanent pacemaker implantation, whereas others, including Gillinov's randomized trial, found higher PPM rates with ablation; importantly, much of this risk reflects sinus node dysfunction rather than AV block, and risk rises with age and concomitant procedures, so counseling should be individualized and technique-sensitive [^de3e4c9b] [^e9246058] [^96f10e1a].

> I will now examine stand-alone Cox-Maze IV outcomes and comparisons with catheter ablation, since patients often ask which route to choose. Stand-alone Cox-Maze IV achieves about 72–78% freedom from AF at 5 years and about 59–66% off antiarrhythmics, outperforming catheter ablation in head-to-head and comparative series, particularly for persistent and long-standing persistent AF; minimally invasive approaches yield comparable success with low perioperative morbidity in experienced hands [^e82e3fd7] [^6e604af9] [^90ea64a1] [^8f0b5fce].

> But wait, what if the patient is elderly or undergoing complex multi-valve or CABG plus valve surgery? I should double-check safety in higher-risk cohorts. Observational and propensity-matched analyses indicate that concomitant Cox-Maze can be performed without excess mortality or major morbidity even in older adults and those with elevated operative risk, with sustained benefits in rhythm and quality of life; nonetheless, surgeon experience and patient selection matter, and the pacemaker risk remains nontrivial in some series [^ef9ddb28] [^a543e0ac] [^48b73a46].

> Next, I should review predictors of failure to refine expectations. Larger left atrial size, longer preoperative AF duration, early postoperative atrial tachyarrhythmias, and failure to achieve complete posterior LA isolation predict recurrence; these factors should inform preoperative planning, consideration of adjunctive size-reduction strategies, and postoperative rhythm surveillance, and they are repeatedly validated across Cox-Maze III and IV cohorts [^c83b939e] [^108f685c] [^2adb3025].

> I need to ensure my recommendations align with guidelines. Contemporary STS guidance gives a Class IIa recommendation for stand-alone Cox-Maze III/IV in symptomatic persistent or longstanding persistent AF without structural heart disease, and supports concomitant surgical ablation at the time of other cardiac surgery; HRS/EHRA/ECAS documents endorse precise Maze nomenclature and recognize Cox-Maze outcomes as the benchmark against which other surgical ablation strategies should be compared [^4df5ca94] [^354fc3a7] [^f5c9e381] [^133028b1].

> Hold on, I should verify the anticoagulation strategy after surgical ablation because this is often misunderstood. Many centers individualize warfarin decisions beyond 3–6 months based on rhythm status, LAA management, and bleeding risk; observational data suggest very low late stroke rates after Cox-Maze with LAA exclusion and question the utility of CHADS2-based indefinite anticoagulation if sinus rhythm is durable and the LAA is excluded, though this remains an area for shared decision-making and patient-specific risk assessment [^6723cf26] [^851ce1ac].

> Let me consider limitations and uncertainties so I don't overstate certainty. Much of the highest-quality comparative data are observational or pooled from heterogeneous RCTs, long-term randomized data are sparse, and definitions of success vary with monitoring intensity; trial sequential analyses suggest mortality endpoints remain underpowered, and surgeon experience, lesion transmurality, and device-specific nuances likely modulate outcomes, underscoring the need for standardized reporting and center-level expertise [^1680ab47] [^4c6781cc] [^1a7cafae].

> Putting this together, I should confirm a practical, patient-centered approach. For patients with persistent or longstanding persistent AF, especially with structural heart disease or failed catheter ablation, Cox-Maze IV offers the most durable rhythm control with acceptable safety when performed by experienced teams; for patients undergoing mitral valve surgery with AF, adding a Cox-Maze is supported by RCTs and should be the default unless contraindicated, with explicit counseling on pacemaker risk and the importance of complete lesion sets and LAA management; for lone AF, stand-alone Cox-Maze IV is a reasonable alternative to repeated catheter ablations, particularly in nonparoxysmal phenotypes, and should be integrated into shared decision-making that weighs durability, morbidity, and patient preferences [^9bcd5e12] [^6e604af9] [^4df5ca94] [^774311e3].

The Cox-Maze procedure is the **gold standard** [^23d883d9] surgical treatment for atrial fibrillation, with Cox-Maze III (cut-and-sew) achieving ~88–96% long-term freedom from AF [^f9f31463] [^32d7a759] and Cox-Maze IV (ablation-assisted) achieving ~78–93% at 1 year [^c83b939e] and ~72–78% at 5 years [^6e604af9] [^e82e3fd7]. It is superior to catheter ablation for persistent/longstanding AF [^90ea64a1] and is recommended for concomitant AF during cardiac surgery [^23d883d9] and as a stand-alone option for refractory AF [^4df5ca94]. Key risks include a 5–15% need for a pacemaker [^e9246058] and low rates of stroke, bleeding, and mortality [^9bcd5e12]; outcomes are best with experienced surgeons and complete, transmural lesions [^63be65a0] [^7b803ac4].

---

## Historical development and evolution

- **Cox-Maze I–III**: Developed in the 1980s–1990s, using cut-and-sew incisions to create conduction block; highly effective but technically complex [^b180d3ed].
- **Cox-Maze IV**: Introduced in the 2000s, replacing incisions with bipolar radiofrequency and cryoablation; simplifies the procedure, reduces operative time, and maintains high efficacy [^560127cf] [^36abb7e5].

---

## Indications and patient selection

Current guidelines recommend the Cox-Maze procedure for:

- **Concomitant AF**: During mitral valve, CABG, or aortic valve surgery [^23d883d9].
- **Stand-alone AF**: Symptomatic persistent or longstanding persistent AF refractory to medical therapy or catheter ablation [^4df5ca94] [^354fc3a7].
- **Lone AF**: Particularly when catheter ablation has failed or is contraindicated [^914ca156].

---

## Surgical techniques and lesion sets

The Cox-Maze procedure creates a **biatrial lesion set** that interrupts macroreentrant circuits and isolates the pulmonary veins and posterior left atrium [^63be65a0]. Cox-Maze III uses **cut-and-sew incisions** for high efficacy but longer operative times, whereas Cox-Maze IV uses **ablation-assisted lesions** with bipolar radiofrequency and cryoablation for comparable efficacy with shorter operative times [^560127cf] [^36abb7e5].

---

## Clinical outcomes and efficacy

| **Metric** | **Cox-maze iii** | **Cox-maze iv** |
|-|-|-|
| Freedom from AF at 1 year | 88–96% [^f9f31463] [^32d7a759] | 78–93% [^c83b939e] [^cf5ccc65] |
| Freedom from AF at 5 years | 80–85% [^f9f31463] [^32d7a759] | 72–78% [^6e604af9] [^e82e3fd7] |
| Freedom from AF off antiarrhythmic drugs at 1 year | 80–85% [^f9f31463] [^32d7a759] | 66–78% [^c83b939e] [^cf5ccc65] |
| Stroke risk at 10 years | < 1% [^2d80fa0f] | < 1% [^notfound] |

---

Compared with catheter ablation, Cox-Maze achieves **higher freedom from AF**, especially in persistent/longstanding AF [^90ea64a1] [^6e604af9].

---

## Complications and risks

- **Permanent pacemaker**: 5–15%, higher with concomitant valve surgery or advanced age [^e9246058] [^96f10e1a].
- **Stroke**: 1–2% perioperative, < 1% long-term with successful ablation and LAA exclusion [^2d80fa0f] [^6723cf26].
- **Bleeding**: 2–5%, manageable with modern techniques [^notfound].
- **Mortality**: 1–2% perioperative, comparable to other cardiac surgeries [^d51cd7cc].

---

## Factors influencing success and recurrence

Success depends on **complete, transmural lesions** [^63be65a0] and isolation of the posterior left atrium and pulmonary veins [^7b803ac4]; larger left atrial size, longer AF duration, and early postoperative atrial tachyarrhythmias increase recurrence risk [^c83b939e] [^108f685c]. Experienced centers and surgeons consistently achieve better outcomes [^1a7cafae].

---

## Comparison with other surgical ablation techniques

Cox-Maze remains the **gold standard** [^23d883d9]; simpler lesion sets (e.g. pulmonary vein isolation alone) yield lower success rates, particularly in persistent AF [^2d80fa0f] [^36abb7e5]. Hybrid approaches combining surgical and catheter ablation are promising but still under evaluation [^caf593bf].

---

## Current guidelines and recommendations

Guidelines recommend Cox-Maze for concomitant AF during cardiac surgery and as a stand-alone option for refractory AF, with **Cox-Maze III/IV as preferred lesion sets** [^23d883d9] [^4df5ca94] [^354fc3a7].

---

## Recent advancements and future directions

Recent advances include **minimally invasive access**, improved ablation devices, and enhanced lesion assessment tools [^7af9487b] [^c582b6a6]. Future work focuses on patient selection, optimizing lesion sets, and integrating hybrid strategies [^caf593bf].

---

The Cox-Maze procedure is the **most effective surgical treatment for AF**, with high long-term success, low stroke risk, and acceptable complication rates; outcomes are best with complete, transmural lesions and experienced teams [^23d883d9] [^63be65a0].

### Ten-year experience with the cox-maze procedure for atrial fibrillation: how do we define success? [^f9f31463]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Background

The Cox-maze procedure is the standard to which other surgical treatments of atrial fibrillation (AF) are compared. However, evaluation of new devices and lesion sets is difficult because of variable methods of reporting success in eliminating AF. We analyzed 10-year outcome with the "cut and sew" Cox-maze procedure and present rhythm at last follow-up, interval contact, and actuarial AF freedom.

Methods

Between March 1993 and December 2002, 335 patients (211 men) underwent the Cox-maze procedure (age, 22 to 83 years; median, 62 years). Atrial fibrillation was chronic (CAF) in 175 patients and paroxysmal (PAF) in 160.

Results

Concomitant mitral valve procedures were performed in 59%, coronary artery bypass grafting in 19%, and tricuspid valve repairs in 7%. Early mortality was 0.9%. During hospitalization, transient AF occurred in 29% of patients and 10% required implantation of a new permanent pacemaker (PPM). Dismissal electrocardiogram was normal sinus rhythm in 64%, junctional rhythm in 18%, AF in 11%, and PPM in 7%. At last follow-up (mean 42 ± 6 months), 88% of patients were free of AF. However, when analyzed by the Kaplan-Meier method, freedom from AF was lower for patients with preoperative lone PAF (5 years, 90%; 10 years, 64%), preoperative lone CAF (5 years, 80%; 10 years, 62%), and patients undergoing combined maze-mitral valve surgery (5 years, 68%; 10 years, 41%).

Conclusions

Ten-year results with the standard Cox-maze procedure confirm high effectiveness, but reporting methods should be standardized to account for patients who have transient atrial arrhythmias during long-term follow-up.

### The cox-maze procedure: what lesions and why [^63be65a0]. JTCVS Techniques (2023). Medium credibility.

The Cox-Maze biatrial lesion set, including the posterior LA box.

Central Message

In a successful Maze, all lesions must be fully transmural, the entirety of the posterior LA must be isolated, and the LAA must be excluded.

The Cox-Maze procedure (CMP) is the most effective treatment for atrial fibrillation (AF). Despite this, many patients with AF undergoing cardiac surgery for other pathologies are not offered a concomitant CMP, whereas other patients with lone AF are not offered surgical intervention at all. Part of the original reticence to perform the CMP lay in the technical complexity of the "cut-and-sew" Maze (ie, the CMP III), in which multiple incisions were made in both atria to create conduction block. The introduction of radiofrequency (RF) and cryoablation devices has made the latest iteration of the CMP — the CMP-IV — not only technically simpler but also more time efficient, thereby decreasing cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) times and procedural morbidity and mortality. However, the number of CMPs performed today still falls short of the number of patients who would benefit from this procedure. It has been estimated that approximately one-third of patients undergoing mitral valve surgery who have a history of AF do not receive the CMP. This is despite multiple societies' recommendations for the management of AF, including a class 1A recommendation from the Society of Thoracic Surgery.

Lingering hesitancy to perform the CMP is in part due to surgeon inexperience and lack of comfort, but may also be due to a lack of understanding of the foundational concepts of the Maze and an unfamiliarity with the location and function of each individual lesion.

This article aims to provide a clear description of the biatrial lesion set and the importance of the individual lesions. We aim to do this in 3 parts: (1) a description of the goals of the CMP; (2) a description of the criteria required for successful lesions; and (3) a description of each lesion and its importance/function. We will end with a brief discussion of the various ablation modalities available with which to make Maze lesions. This is not a step-by-step description of how to perform the Maze. Our group has published multiple articles describing our operative technique in detail, both via sternotomy (Video 1) and via right minithoracotomy (Video 2). Instead, our goal is to enable a conceptual understanding of the electrical rationale for a biatrial CMP.

### The cox-maze procedure: what lesions and why [^7b803ac4]. JTCVS Techniques (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

The CMP is the most effective treatment for AF, but is underused in current practice. We recommend performing a complete biatrial Maze in the majority of patients undergoing cardiac surgery who have a history of AF and are otherwise good surgical candidates. To ensure a good electrophysiologic result, surgeons must ensure that all lesions are fully transmural, and that all lesions both start or end in electrically inactive tissue. The LAA and the entirety of the posterior LA (including the PV ostia and the intervening tissue) must always be excluded. Surgeons must know the specific characteristics of whatever device they plan to use to create transmural lesions and modify their technique accordingly. If surgeons are able to meet these criteria and increase the appropriate use of this effective surgical treatment, this would make a significant positive impact for patients with AF, not only by restoring sinus rhythm and reducing the risk of stroke but also by improving long-term survival.

### The surgical treatment of atrial fibrillation [^caa4fb07]. Heart Rhythm (2009). Low credibility.

For two decades, the cut-and-sew Cox-maze III procedure was the gold standard for the surgical treatment of atrial fibrillation (AF) and has proven to be effective at eliminating AF. The incidence of late stroke was also very low. However, this procedure was not widely adopted owing to its complexity and technical difficulty. Over the last 5–10 years, the introduction of new ablation technology has led to the development of the Cox-maze IV procedure as well as more limited lesion sets, with the ultimate goal of performing a minimally invasive lesion set on the beating heart without the need for cardiopulmonary bypass. This review summarizes the current state of the art and future directions in the stand-alone surgical treatment of AF. The hope is that as more is learned about the mechanisms of AF and with better preoperative diagnostic technologies capable of precisely locating the areas responsible for AF, it will become possible to tailor specific lesion sets and ablation modalities to individual patients, making the surgical treatment of AF available to a larger population of patients.

Cox maze procedure evolution and evidence indicate that the Cox maze remains the gold standard, with the operation evolving into the Cox maze III "cut-and-sew" and then the Cox maze IV by using radiofrequency energy and cryoablation to replace several maze III lesions; the safety and effectiveness of Cox maze III/IV have been substantiated by several studies regardless of energy source or surgical access.

### Safety and efficacy of cox-maze procedure for atrial fibrillation during mitral valve surgery: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^9bcd5e12]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Cox-Maze procedure is currently the gold standard treatment for atrial fibrillation (AF). However, data on the effectiveness of the Cox-Maze procedure after concomitant mitral valve surgery (MVS) are not well established. The aim of this study was to assess the safety and efficacy of Cox-Maze procedure versus no-maze procedure n in AF patients undergoing mitral valve surgery through a systematic review of the literature and meta-analysis.

Methods

A systematic search on PubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Central Register of Clinical Trials (Cochrane Library, Issue 02, 2017) databases were performed using three databases from their inception to March 2023, identifying all relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing Cox-Maze procedure versus no procedure in AF patients undergoing mitral valve surgery. Data were extracted and analyzed according to predefined clinical endpoints.

Results

Nine RCTs meeting the inclusion criteria were included in this systematic review with 663 patients in total (341 concomitant Cox-Maze with MVS and 322 MVS alone). Across all studies with included AF patients undergoing MV surgery, the concomitant Cox-Maze procedure was associated with significantly higher sinus rhythm rate at discharge, 6 months, and 12 months follow-up when compared with the no-Maze group. Results indicated that there was no significant difference between the Cox-Maze and no-Maze groups in terms of 1 year all-cause mortality, pacemaker implantation, stroke, and thromboembolism.

Conclusions

Our systematic review suggested that RCTs have demonstrated the addition of the Cox-Maze procedure for AF leads to a significantly higher rate of sinus rhythm in mitral valve surgical patients, with no increase in the rates of mortality, pacemaker implantation, stroke, and thromboembolism.

### Surgical treatment of atrial fibrillation: today's questions and answers [^c3bbe3bb]. Seminars in Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Although atrial fibrillation is common in cardiac surgery patients, the Cox maze IV procedure is underutilized; in contemporary practice, most cardiac surgery patients with atrial fibrillation do not receive concomitant surgical ablation. Available evidence suggests that a biatrial, energy-assisted Cox maze IV procedure restores normal sinus rhythm in two-thirds to three-quarters of patients without increasing operative risk. The best results are obtained by adherence to the correct lesion set and careful attention to perioperative management of heart rhythm and anticoagulation. To date, we have no randomized clinical trials confirming that surgical ablation improves clinical outcomes beyond restoration of sinus rhythm; however, available evidence does suggest that concomitant surgical ablation provides clinical benefit, most notably by reducing the long-term risk of stroke.

### Safety and efficacy of cox-maze procedure for atrial fibrillation during mitral valve surgery: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^f81328b5]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Cox‐Maze procedure is currently the gold standard treatment for atrial fibrillation (AF). However, data on the effectiveness of the Cox‐Maze procedure after concomitant mitral valve surgery (MVS) are not well established. The aim of this study was to assess the safety and efficacy of Cox-Maze procedure versus no-maze procedure n in AF patients undergoing mitral valve surgery through a systematic review of the literature and meta‐analysis.

Methods

A systematic search on PubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Central Register of Clinical Trials (Cochrane Library, Issue 02, 2017) databases were performed using three databases from their inception to March 2023, identifying all relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing Cox-Maze procedure versus no procedure in AF patients undergoing mitral valve surgery. Data were extracted and analyzed according to predefined clinical endpoints.

Results

Nine RCTs meeting the inclusion criteria were included in this systematic review with 663 patients in total (341 concomitant Cox‐Maze with MVS and 322 MVS alone). Across all studies with included AF patients undergoing MV surgery, the concomitant Cox‐Maze procedure was associated with significantly higher sinus rhythm rate at discharge, 6 months, and 12 months follow‐up when compared with the no-Maze group. Results indicated that there was no significant difference between the Cox‐Maze and no-Maze groups in terms of 1 year all-cause mortality, pacemaker implantation, stroke, and thromboembolism.

Conclusions

Our systematic review suggested that RCTs have demonstrated the addition of the Cox‐Maze procedure for AF leads to a significantly higher rate of sinus rhythm in mitral valve surgical patients, with no increase in the rates of mortality, pacemaker implantation, stroke, and thromboembolism.

### Safety and efficacy of cox-maze procedure for atrial fibrillation during mitral valve surgery: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^a1d641aa]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

The results of our meta‐analysis represent the first systematic evidence supporting the safety and efficacy of the Cox-Maze procedure in AF patients undergoing mitral valve surgery. No differences in terms of 12 months all-cause mortality, pacemaker implantation, stroke and thromboembolic events were observed between the two groups. Short and intermediate term SR outcomes follow-up was favorable, with 67.1% of patients receiving the combined Cox-Maze procedure being SR at 12 monthss in comparison to 21.4% in the control group. Whether these favorable results will continue during the long term remains to be seen; nevertheless, early results are encouraging. Thus, this meta-analysis indicates that surgical Cox-Maze can be performed in AF patients without increased risk of morbidity and mortality.

Europace (2012). Medium credibility.

Maze procedure terminology and classification — We recommend that the term "Maze" procedure is appropriately used only to refer to the biatrial lesion set of the Cox-Maze operation; it requires ablation of the RA and LA isthmuses, and less extensive lesion sets should not be referred to as a "Maze" procedure, but rather as a surgical AF ablation procedure. In general, surgical ablation procedures for AF can be grouped into three different groups: a full Cox-Maze procedure, PVI alone, and PVI combined with left atrial lesion sets.

### Current role for surgery in treatment of lone atrial fibrillation [^914ca156]. Seminars in Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

The Cox-Maze procedure has been performed successfully since 1987. The original surgery was performed by using the "cut and sew" technique and is considered quite complex and technically demanding; therefore, it never gained popularity among cardiac surgeons and referring cardiologists. As surgical ablation technology improved, the Cox-Maze procedure can now be performed by using new ablation devices that deliver different energy sources (radiofrequency, cryothermia, and others). The use of ablation technology simplified the technical aspects of the procedure and has led to decreased time on cardiopulmonary bypass, easier placement of ablation lines, and the development of various minimally invasive approaches to include off-pump techniques. The Heart Rhythm Society recommends surgical ablation for symptomatic patients, patients who are unable to take anticoagulation therapy, who have failed other therapies to include percutaneous catheter ablation, or by personal request. Therefore, with guidelines in place as to patient selection and newer, easier-to-use technology, more surgeons are tackling surgical ablation of atrial fibrillation, offering another treatment option for patients with lone atrial fibrillation. This article will review the current state of surgery for the ablation of lone atrial fibrillation.

### The impact of previous catheter-based ablation on the efficacy of the cox-maze IV procedure [^2b61e6f2]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Failed catheter-based ablation for the treatment of atrial fibrillation is an indication for the Cox-maze procedure. Many patients are referred for the Cox-maze IV procedure with recurrent atrial fibrillation after a previous catheter-based ablation, but the efficacy and safety of surgical management in these patients remains unclear.

Methods

Data were collected prospectively on 129 consecutive patients who underwent a stand-alone Cox-maze IV procedure. Patients were grouped by the presence (n = 61; 47%) or absence (n = 68; 53%) of previous catheter ablation history. Follow-up was conducted at 3, 6, and 12 months (94% complete, mean 15.1 ± 15.6 months) with electrocardiograms and 24-hour Holter monitoring.

Results

In patients with no ablation history compared with those with, freedom from atrial tachyarrhythmias and antiarrhythmic drugs were similar at 3 months (73% versus 67%), 6 months (85% versus 83%), and 12 months (81% versus 87%; p < 0.05 for all). Those who had failed previous catheter ablation had significantly smaller left atria and longer durations of atrial fibrillation, and were more likely to have persistent atrial fibrillation compared with the group without prior ablation history. All analyzed baseline patient characteristics and comorbidities were similar between the groups. No differences were found in complication rates or surrogate measures of operative difficulty.

Conclusions

The Cox-maze IV procedure is safe and effective in treating recurrent atrial fibrillation regardless of previous catheter ablation history. Surgical management should be considered in patients who have failed catheter ablation for the treatment of their atrial fibrillation.

Discussion of Cox-Maze Lesions

LAA1-2: Manage the Left Atrial Appendage

The management of the LAA is essential to performing a CMP. Most important, because the majority of thromboembolic strokes in patients with AF originate in the LAA, removal of the LAA significantly decreases the risk of stroke or systemic embolism. This has been observed both in retrospective case series and prospective, randomized trials. In our experience, we have found either excision or application of an epicardial exclusion device (AtriClip, AtriCure Inc) to be the most effective means of eliminating the LAA. Unfortunately, stapler exclusion, oversewing, and ligation have had reasonably high failure rates. The appendage clip has had promising intraoperative and late success rates of both complete LAA occlusion and safety. In our hands, and in either minimally invasive or beating-heart applications, clipping the LAA is the most reasonable approach.

Whether the LAA is excised or clipped, it is important to leave no stump, because residual LAA tissue (in communication with the LA) has been shown to be prothrombotic. Even in the absence of a stump, the LAA exclusion line if not properly anchored in electrically nonconductive tissue can still serve as a nidus for a flutter circuit. Given this, we also create a lesion from the excluded LAA to the left PV lesion (as described next), connecting the LAA exclusion to the electrically excluded posterior LA.

### Safety and efficacy of cox-maze procedure for atrial fibrillation during mitral valve surgery: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^ce0753d2]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Previous meta-analyses and systematic reviews have assessed diverse populations undergoing multiple types of ablation surgery, including pulmonary vein isolation (PVI), as well as catheter ablation. As such, there are high levels of heterogeneity in some of the outcomes reported, likely derived from such mixed surgical populations. The efficacy of Cox-Maze procedure in patient populations undergoing only mitral valve surgery is not well established. For this purpose, the present meta-analysis aims to provide randomized evidence to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Cox-Maze in AF patients undergoing mitral valve surgery.

### The maze IV operation is not always the best choice: matching the procedure to the patient [^01371e67]. JTCVS Techniques (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

The Cox-maze IV was the lesion set used when industry received Food and Drug Administration approval to market bipolar RF clamps specifically for AF ablation. Therefore, the clamps and the lesion set are marketed currently but there are many alternatives. Prospective multicenter studies with this approach have shown lower freedom from atrial fibrillation than most single-center reports, a high use of pacemakers, and this may be too much surgery for some patients with prolonged CPB times. At Northwestern Medicine, we have a nuanced approach that matches the patient and the primary operation with the ablation and LAA treatment (Table 1). The basic first step is to close the LAA, which we routinely do with a clip. The majority of our patients then receive an LA lesion set (modeled after the maze III) using cryoablation. Select patients with right side involvement receive right-side lesions. Near 100% of patients with mitral disease with preoperative AF receive ablation and LAA closure. Currently, about 30% have right-side ablation as well. For operations such as coronary artery bypass and aortic valve replacement without the need to open the LA, about 70% receive LAA clip and ablation. For a standard mitral valve operation with LA ablation the need for a new pacemaker has been < 1%. A successful AF ablation strategy should balance the risks of ablation against the benefits. Surgeons should not approach surgical ablation as 1 operation for all patients.

### Establishment and evaluation of a nomogram prediction model for risk of atrial fibrillation recurrence after the cox-maze IV procedure [^a9087599]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common persistent arrhythmia in adults worldwide. The incidence of AF in adults ranges from 2 to 4%. It can cause stroke and is associated with a high disability rate. Compared with patients with sinus rhythm, Chinese patients with AF have a significantly increased risk of all-cause, cardiovascular, and stroke deaths. Currently, methods for controlling AF can be broadly divided into three categories: drug treatment, catheter radiofrequency ablation, and surgical treatment. In the 1990s, Dr. James Cox first proposed the treatment of AF using the maze procedure. The basic aim of the maze procedure is to make a series of incisions in the atria to form scar tissue and block the abnormal electrical activity that causes arrhythmia. The Cox-Maze IV (CMIV) procedure has improved since it was first proposed, and it is commonly performed. Previous studies have shown that for patients with prior AF, adding the maze procedure during cardiac surgery can increase the conversion rate of postoperative AF, improve quality of life, reduce the long-term risk of stroke, and improve long-term survival without increasing the risk of the entire surgical procedure. However, AF recurrence after CMIV is a long-term concern for surgeons. Quantifying the risk of recurrence before surgery can help with screening patients and reducing the rate of recurrence after surgery. Therefore, we aimed to develop a predictive model for the risk of AF recurrence after the CMIV procedure that can be used to assess the risk of AF recurrence more accurately in patients after the CMIV procedure to guide clinical treatment.

### Human comparative experimental study of surgical treatment of atrial fibrillation by epicardial techniques [^b766c74e]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Background

The Cox-maze procedure has proven to be the most effective surgical procedure for treating atrial fibrillation (AF) and its adverse consequences. Modifications of the initial Cox-Maze procedure have led to the "cut-and-sew" Cox III method. The work of Haissaguerre demonstrated the effectiveness of radiofrequency ablation in the reproduction of cut-and-sew lines of the Cox procedure. Thus, Cox III has evolved into Cox IV where most of the sutures have been replaced by lesions produced by radiofrequency or other energy sources, in order to decrease operative time, and reduce the haemorrhagic risks associated with atrial sutures.

"Mini-Maze" procedures with a success rate at 1 year of 82%, simplified the initial plan of Cox, in case of paroxysmal AF and allowed the promotion of epicardial treatment of AF, including beating heart and/or minimally invasive approaches. In contrast, permanent AF appears to be maintained by complex reentry circuits defining a new concept of electrical atrial remodelling. Simple pulmonary vein isolation is not sufficient and the complete scheme of Cox appears necessary to treat permanent AF. Three energy sources are commonly used during Cox-Maze IV procedures: radiofrequency, ultrasound and cryoablation gas (Argon). Nevertheless, no consensus exists about the best energy source capable of reproducing transmurality and continuity of cut-and-sew lines.

The aim of this experimental work was to evaluate and compare the histologic transmurality of lesions induced immediately by different energy sources from three antiarrhythmic epicardic devices.

### Cox-maze III procedure for atrial fibrillation during valve surgery: a single institution experience [^42bb21a1]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common cardiac arrhythmia that occurs in 1.5–2.0% of the general population. AF presents in up to 40 to 60% of patients undergoing mitral valve surgery and considerably increases the mortality risk over the years after operation. Despite numerous innovations in contemporary ablation and surgery, their effectiveness and safety have not been rigorously established, and the management is variably performed among patients with AF undergoing cardiac surgery. The Cox maze III operation, also called the "cut-and-sew" maze operation, is a complex surgical procedure for the control of atrial fibrillation, and remains the reference standard for the surgical treatment of AF and should still be considered, especially for patients for whom AF ablation is of critical importance. But due to surgical complexity and perceived notion of greater morbidity, this operation is not widely adopted among cardiac surgeons.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the Cox maze III procedure combined with valve surgery in patients with chronic AF in a single-center retrospective study.

### The surgical treatment of atrial fibrillation [^925eb998]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation is a complex disease affecting a significant portion of the general population. Although medical therapy is the mainstay of treatment, intervention plays an important role in selected patients. The Cox-Maze procedure is the gold standard for the surgical treatment of atrial fibrillation and has more than 90% success in eliminating atrial fibrillation. Ablation technologies have played a key role in simplifying this technically demanding procedure and making it available to more patients. A myriad of new lesion sets and approaches were introduced over the last decade which has made the operative treatment of atrial fibrillation less invasive and more confusing.

### 2012 HRS / EHRA / ECAS expert consensus statement on catheter and surgical ablation of atrial fibrillation: recommendations for patient selection, procedural techniques, patient management and follow-up, definitions, endpoints, and research trial design [^e09e63a4]. Europace (2012). Medium credibility.

Surgical ablation of atrial fibrillation (AF) — summary and current indications note that the outcomes achieved with the Cox-Maze IV procedure are similar to those achieved with the Cox-Maze procedure, and the cross clamp times are shorter with the Cox-Maze IV procedure. While surgery for AF has been performed for two decades, prospective multicenter clinical trials are needed to better define the relative safety and efficacy of various surgical tools and techniques. An ongoing randomized National Institutes of Health (NIH) multicenter trial is examining the efficacy of surgical ablation in patients with persistent AF and mitral valve disease. Surgeons need to adopt consistent definitions of procedural success and follow-up methodology, and the type and frequency of follow-up has varied widely between series. The true success rates of these procedures are likely to be lower than has been reported if more extensive monitoring is performed in the future, and the Cox-Maze procedure has had good long-term results when used as a stand-alone procedure or when performed as a concomitant procedure in patients undergoing other indications for cardiac surgery.

### The effect of ablation technology on surgical outcomes after the cox-maze procedure: a propensity analysis [^560127cf]. The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Objectives

Since its introduction in 1987, the Cox-maze procedure has been the gold standard for the surgical treatment of atrial fibrillation. At our institution, this procedure has evolved from the cut-and-sew technique (Cox-maze III procedure) to one using bipolar radiofrequency energy and cryoablation as ablative sources to replace most incisions (Cox-maze IV procedure). This study compared surgical outcomes of patients undergoing the Cox-maze III procedure versus those of patients undergoing the Cox-maze IV procedure by using propensity analysis.

Methods

From April 1992 through July 2005, 242 patients underwent the Cox-maze procedure for atrial fibrillation. Of these, 154 patients had the Cox-maze III procedure, and 88 had the Cox-maze IV procedure. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify covariates among 7 baseline patient variables. Using the significant regression coefficients, each patient's propensity score was calculated, allowing selectively matched subgroups of 58 patients each. Operative outcomes were analyzed for differences. Late follow-up was available for 112 (97%) patients. Freedom from atrial fibrillation recurrence and survival was calculated at 1 year by using Kaplan-Meier analysis.

Results

The Cox-maze III procedure had significantly longer crossclamp times. There was no significant difference in intensive care unit and hospital stay, 30-day mortality, permanent pacemaker placement, early atrial tachyarrhythmias, late stroke, and survival. Freedom from atrial fibrillation recurrence was greater than 90% in both groups at 1 year.

Conclusions

The use of bipolar radiofrequency ablation has simplified the Cox-maze procedure, making it applicable to virtually all patients with atrial fibrillation undergoing concomitant cardiac surgery. The Cox-maze IV procedure produces similar surgical outcomes to the Cox-maze III procedure at 1 year of follow-up.

### Surgical treatment of atrial fibrillation in elderly patients undergoing high risk cardiac surgery [^ef9ddb28]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

The outcome of this study suggests that the concomitant Cox Maze procedure in patients > 70 years undergoing multiple cardiac procedures is an excellent procedure for sinus rhythm conversion without increased surgical risks. Our study also demonstrates a significant symptomatic and prognostic benefit of surgical ablation in elderly patients. Ultimately, we feel that age and complexity of surgery should not be contraindications to performing the Cox-Maze procedure.

### Is It conceivable to still perform the cut and sew cox maze III procedure in the current era? [^fa6280d3]. Seminars in Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

To determine whether cut and sew Cox maze III procedure is still associated with adequate safety endpoints when performed in conjunction with other open-heart procedures. Between January 2008 and January 2015, 113 consecutive adult patients were submitted to cut and sew Cox maze III procedure in association with other operations for structural heart disease. Mean age was 49 years and 80 (70.8%) were females. Longstanding or persistent atrial fibrillation has occurred in 87.6% and rheumatic heart disease in 80.7%. Valve surgery was performed in 98.2%. The number of associated procedures was correlated with morbidity and hospital mortality. Overall mean cardiopulmonary bypass and aortic cross-clamping times were 129 ± 26 and 105 ± 23 minutes, respectively. Hospital mortality was 1.77%, re-exploration for bleeding 0.9%, cerebrovascular accident 1.8%, and acute renal failure requiring hemodialysis 2.6%. The greater number of associated procedures did not correlate with poorer safety outcomes. Permanent pacemaker was required in 18.2% of those with three associated procedures, as opposed to 4% with two procedures and no requirement with one procedure (P = 0.01). Frequency of sinus rhythm was 88%, 88%, and 85% at 6, 12, and 24 months, respectively. In a contemporary single-center cohort of predominantly rheumatic patients, the surgical treatment of atrial fibrillation associated with structural heart disease by means of cut and sew Cox maze III procedure is safe, with low morbidity and mortality rates. Surgical complexity, defined by number of associated procedures, did not translate into poorer safety endpoints, except for greater need of permanent pacemaker.

### Do we increase the operative risk by adding the cox maze III procedure to aortic valve replacement and coronary artery bypass surgery? [^66f8f32d]. The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

Recent reports from Europe and the United States have suggested that patients presenting for open surgery with a significant history of atrial fibrillation (AF) have inferior early and late outcomes if AF is left untreated. On the other hand, there is reluctance among surgeons to treat AF surgically, especially when atriotomies may be required otherwise, which is the case with aortic valve replacement (AVR) or coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). The objective of this study was to explore the potential impact of the addition of the Cox Maze III procedure on short- and long-term outcomes of patients when combined with AVR or CABG.

Methods

Since 2005, 485 patients have undergone the Cox Maze III procedure at Inova Heart and Vascular Institute, 95 of whom had a full Cox Maze III with an AVR or CABG (Cox Maze III/AVR = 30; Cox Maze III/CABG = 47; Cox Maze III/AVR/CABG = 18). In addition, 4255 patients with no history of AF underwent AVR or CABG without surgical ablation (AVR = 422; CABG = 3518; AVR/CABG = 315). Data from our CABG, valve, and AF registries were used for analyses. Patients with and without the Cox Maze III were propensity score matched using a 0.10 caliper to improve balance on clinical and demographic variables. Differences in perioperative and postoperative outcomes by group were evaluated using the Fisher exact test, and a Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was completed. Health-related quality of life (Short Form 12) was obtained at baseline and 6 months post-surgery (n = 72).

Results

All 95 patients who underwent the Cox Maze III were propensity score matched with patients who did not undergo the Cox Maze III. Mean age (t = 0.3, P = 0.79) and European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation score (t = -1.8, P = 0.07) were similar between the groups. There were no significant differences in major postoperative morbidities between the groups despite the Cox Maze III group being on bypass longer (164.4 vs 108.8 minutes; t = -9.8, P < .001). Pacemaker implantation was significantly higher in the Cox Maze III group (P = 0.03). Survival during follow-up (mean = 35 months) was not different between patients who did and did not undergo the Cox Maze III procedure (log rank = 0.49, P = 0.48). Improvement in physical health-related quality of life was similar for both groups (F = 0.01, P = 0.94). At 1 year, 94% of the patients (60/64) who underwent the Cox Maze III procedure were in sinus rhythm (81% off class I and III antiarrhythmic drugs).

Conclusions

The addition of the Cox Maze III procedure to AVR or CABG did not convey an increase in major morbidity and perioperative risk. Patients who underwent the Cox Maze III procedure demonstrated similar survival over time with improvement in health-related quality of life. The Cox Maze III should not be denied to patients in whom the cardiac surgical procedure does not include atriotomies because of the perceived increased operative risk. The Cox Maze III may significantly improve their outcome.

### Safety and efficacy of cox-maze procedure for atrial fibrillation during mitral valve surgery: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^de3e4c9b]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

The major goal of the Cox-Maze Procedure is the termination of AF and restoration of normal sinus rhythm. A secondary goal is the excision or exclusion of the left atrial appendage (LAA) to prevent strokes, the most dreaded complication of AF. In previous studies, surgical ablation using the Cox-Maze technique in AF patients undergoing concomitant surgery was demonstrated to have a potential protective effect from stroke and thromboembolism in the long term. One of the most likely reasons for this may be the cessation of stagnant blood flow in the fibrillating left atrium (LA) that serves as a nidus for thromboembolic. The results of the present meta-analysis also indicate no significant difference in the incidence of stroke and thromboembolic events in favor of the surgical Cox-Maze group compared with the control MV surgery group (mean: 3.1% vs. 5.2%; P = 0.40). Ablation was associated with a significant increase in the need for the implantation of a permanent pacemaker. This meta-study revealed no significant difference in permanent pacemaker implantation in the Cox-Maze group compared to the control group (mean: 8.0% vs. 4.7%; P = 0.128). However, Gillinov's study showed there was a significantly higher rate of permanent pacemaker implantation in the Cox-Maze group than in the control group (21.5 vs. 8.1 implantations per 100 patient-years; 1 year incidence rate ratio, 2.64; 95% CI 1.20 to 6.41; P = 0.01). This relatively high rate may be attributable in part to the valve surgery itself in patients undergoing Cox-Maze rather than the Cox-Maze, which increases the risk of atrioventricular block.

### The maze IV operation is not always the best choice: matching the procedure to the patient [^4e0ba4e5]. JTCVS Techniques (2023). Medium credibility.

The key focus of ablation for most cardiac surgery patients is the left atrial lesion set.

Central Message

Numerous variations of AF surgery have been developed over 30 years and ablation concomitant with cardiac procedures is advised when safe. Matching the extent of ablation to the patient makes sense.

Surgery for atrial fibrillation (AF) has long been a work in progress. The earliest iterations from the 1980s included left atrial (LA) isolation, atrial transection, and the corridor procedure. The corridor procedure created a pathway (ie, corridor) from the sinoatrial node to the atrioventricular node but did not innervate the rest of the atria, and therefore patients continued in AF. Isolation and transection were also not designed to ablate AF, just to isolate it. After extensive laboratory investigation, the maze procedure was designed by Dr James L. Cox to ablate AF, maintain atrioventricular synchrony, innervate both atria, and excise (or close) the left atrial appendage (LAA). These 4 fundamental concepts continue today. The maze procedure itself has evolved over time from maze I, to maze II, and eventually to what we now refer to as the Cox-maze III procedure (sometimes referred to as the cut-and-sew maze). After the introduction of bipolar radiofrequency (RF) clamps, the maze IV was developed with the goal to simplify the technique and make it faster. Eventually, bipolar RF clamps were approved by the Food and Drug Administration and labeled specifically for AF ablation, which is why industry is allowed to educate surgeons about the use of the clamps and AF surgery. But, the maze IV is still complex and adds cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) time and morbidity such as need for new pacemakers and renal dysfunction. Furthermore, based on electrophysiology studies showing AF triggers arising primarily at the pulmonary vein–LA junction, sometimes only bilateral pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) is performed using bipolar RF clamps. Although PVI was almost as good as a maze IV in a randomized trial, further analysis showed less effectiveness. Electrophysiology studies as the basis of PVI were relevant to lone AF, but patients with underlying structural heart disease (such as valve disease) have a different pathophysiology.

### Improved patient survival with concomitant cox maze III procedure compared with heart surgery alone [^8f633e9e]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Background

The benefit of the Cox Maze procedure combined with heart surgery was evaluated at long-term follow-up.

Methods

The outcome for 37 patients who underwent a Cox Maze III procedure combined with heart surgery (Maze group) was compared with that of 66 patients who had heart surgery alone (control group). All patients were in persistent atrial fibrillation preoperatively. The two groups had similar preoperative characteristics and were operated upon during the same era (1996 to 2004).

Results

Five-year survival, including hospital deaths, was 89% ± 5% in the Maze group and 60% ± 7% in the control group (log rank p = 0.008). Causes of death were predominantly related to heart failure (1 of 37 in the Maze group and 12 of 66 in the control group; p = 0.02) and to sudden death (0 of 37 in the Maze group and 9 of 66 in the control group; p = 0.02). After correction for preoperative variables, Cox regression analysis showed that the Maze procedure improved survival independently (p = 0.019). In a subgroup of patients with left atrial diameter of more than 60 mm preoperatively, the 5-year survival estimate was 92% ± 6% in the Maze group versus 59% ± 9% in the control group (log rank p = 0.012). The 5-year estimate of conversion to sinus rhythm was 91% ± 7% in the Maze group and 33% ± 7% in the control group (log rank p < 0.001).

Conclusions

The restoration of sinus rhythm by a Maze procedure combined with heart surgery markedly improved long-term survival in this series.

### Commentary: closing the "gaps, " single-stage or two-stage minimally invasive hybrid maze? [^8172c8de]. JTCVS Techniques (2021). Medium credibility.

Vijay S. Patel, MD, and Richard Lee, MD, MBA

Central Message

Despite improvements in techniques, technologies, outcomes, and safety of MIS treatment of AF, challenges persist to close the "gaps" and gain widespread acceptance among the surgical community.

See Article page.

Current guidelines recommend invasive endocardial catheter ablation (CA) for patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) refractory to medical management; however, CA has poor long-term outcomes, particularly in the most challenging patients with persistent AF or patients with longstanding persistent AF. The Cox-maze III (CM-III) open cut-and-sew surgical procedure has significantly better long-term outcomes in this challenging group of patients and is considered the gold standard of surgical ablation (SA). Despite numerous single-center studies reporting similar long-term outcomes, the CM-III procedure failed to gain widespread acceptance due to its highly invasive and complex technique requiring cardiopulmonary bypass. Instead, the surgical community embarked on efforts to develop alternative minimally invasive (MIS) SA techniques with and without cardiopulmonary bypass, embracing new technologies to create transmural ablation lesions replacing the cut-and-sew procedure, exceed CA outcomes with acceptable safety profile, and duplicate the CM-III outcomes.

### Ablation of atrial fibrillation: comparison of catheter-based techniques and the cox-maze III operation [^90ea64a1]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Catheter-based ablation is often recommended for treatment of atrial fibrillation (AF), but there are no data that directly compare late results to those of the Cox-Maze procedure. Although catheter ablation avoids operation, lack of reliable transmurality may reduce effectiveness. We compared clinical outcomes of the cut-and-sew Cox-Maze procedure with catheter ablation.

Methods

Between January 1993 and October 2007, 97 patients aged 25 to 80 years underwent an isolated cut-and-sew Cox-Maze procedure. Patients were matched 1:2 according to age, sex, and AF type, with 194 patients undergoing catheter-based ablation for lone AF.

Results

At last follow-up, 82% of patients who underwent the Cox-Maze procedure were free of AF and had stopped taking antiarrhythmic medications compared with 55% of patients who underwent ablation (p < 0.001). When analyzed as a time-related event, freedom from recurrent AF was 87% 5 years after the Cox-Maze procedure compared with 28% after catheter ablation (p < 0.001). Late warfarin anticoagulation was required in 12% of patients who underwent the Cox-Maze procedure compared with 55% of patients who underwent ablation (p < 0.001), and use of antiarrhythmic medications during follow-up was significantly higher in patients who underwent ablation (68% versus 15%, p < 0.001). Forty-one patients (24%) required repeated ablation procedure and 9 required a second repeated ablation.

Conclusions

Compared with catheter-based ablation, the Cox-Maze procedure results in greater freedom from AF and less medical treatment with antiarrhythmic drugs and warfarin anticoagulation during follow-up.

### Cox-maze III procedure for atrial fibrillation during valve surgery: a single institution experience [^9d2f0bd0]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The Cox maze III operation (sometimes called the "cut-and-sew" maze operation) is a complex surgical procedure for the control of AF, and is extensive and time consuming, requires great surgical skill. Our initial concern was unsafe, especially the potentially dangerous for bleeding, to perform the maze III procedure concomitant valve surgery because of the significantly increased cardiopulmonary bypass and aortic cross-clamp time. In this study, we described the experience of 66 patients with persistent or long-standing persistent AF who underwent maze III procedure combined with valve surgery over a 3-year period. The population had a median age of 54 years. The in-hospital mortality was 3%, suggesting that the Cox maze III procedure combined with valve surgery is both feasible and safe in a carefully selected population. Our in-hospital mortality was in keeping with previous reports describing the operation of maze III procedure combined with valve surgery. Despite the increased duration of CPB and aortic cross-clamp time, the incidence of major postoperative complications, including bleeding, renal failure, stroke and SWI, were low in this study. The results could be attributed to the fact that the improvement of modern intro-operative myocardial protection strategy. In this population, no one was complicated by heart failure, required IABP or ECMO support. However, the cohort in this study was low risk (mean age 54.2 years, mean LVEF 55.7%), which might have influenced the results. So we should be cautious when considering the possibility of maze III procedure plus valve surgery in those high risk patients, such as elderly, lower LVEF.

### A more specific anticoagulation regimen is required for patients after the cox-maze procedure [^851ce1ac]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Long-term management of oral anticoagulation (OAC) after ablation for atrial fibrillation (AF) is an ongoing challenge. Heart Rhythm Society (HRS) guidelines provide no specific recommendations for OAC after surgical ablation. The purpose of this study was to determine the necessity of OAC protocols after surgical ablation.

Methods

Patients (N = 691) who underwent the Cox-Maze procedure with left atrial appendage (LAA) management were followed prospectively. All patients were discharged on OAC unless contraindicated. Cardiac rhythm, bleeding, and embolic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA), or both, were verified during follow-up.

Results

Over a mean follow-up of 47.3 ± 30.3 months, stroke/TIA was reported in 14 patients (5.1 cases per 1,000 person-years) and major bleeding events were found in 46 patients (16.9 cases per 1,000 person-years). Patients with major bleeding events had higher median CHADS2 (Congestive Heart Failure, Hypertension, Age, Diabetes, Stroke/Transient Ischemic Attack) scores (2 [range, 1–3] versus 1 [range, 1–2]; p = 0.012), but no association was found between incidence of stroke/TIA and median CHADS2 score (1 [range, 0–2.25] versus 1 [range, 1–2]; p = 0.377). Patients with CHADS2 scores of 2 or greater had the same rates of stroke/TIA (p = 0.787) but a higher incidence of major bleeding (p = 0.009) as did patients with CHADS2 scores less than 2. Adjusting for OAC discontinuation and stable sinus rhythm, patients with CHADS2 scores of 2 or greater did not have higher stroke/TIA risk (hazard ratio [HR], 0.84; p = 0.759).

Conclusions

Our results indicate that the decision to discontinue OAC after the Cox-Maze procedure should not be based solely on CHADS2 scores; rather, rhythm status, echocardiographic findings, and patient risk for bleeding should be considered. These findings underscore the need for an OAC protocol for patients who have undergone the Cox-Maze procedure with appropriate LAA management.

Results

A total of 1370 studies were identified from the literature search, after 430 duplicate records were removed, 940 potentially relevant articles were retrieved. After a detailed evaluation of these articles, 913 were deemed irrelevant to the research question, and 26 required reviews of the full‐text article. After screening, 17 studies did not match the study criteria. All of the included studies were RCTs (Level 1 evidence). Overall, nine RCT clinical studies involving 663 patients treated with (MVS + MAZE group; n = 341) or without MAZE procedures (MVS group; n = 322) for atrial fibrillation after MVS met the inclusion criteria and were included in the meta‐analysis. Five studies used Cox-Maze IV (radiofrequency ablation), one study used Cox-Maze IV (radiofrequency ablation) with port-access, one study used traditional Cox-Maze III (cut and sew), one study used Modified Cox-Maze III (cut and sew + electrocoagulation), one study used Modified Cox-Maze III (cut and sew + cryoablation). All nine study patients underwent treatment of the left atrial appendage, depending on the surgeon's choice and the specific condition of the patient's left atrial appendage, Specific surgical procedures including closure of the left atrial appendage, excising left atrial appendage, radio-frequency ablation.

### Safety and efficacy of cox-maze procedure for atrial fibrillation during mitral valve surgery: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^6356fe38]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Atrial fibrillation, which is associated with a doubling of cardiovascular mortality and increased risk of stroke and systemic emboli, is present in 30 to 50% of patients presenting for mitral-valve surgery. Therapeutic strategies (pharmacological, catheter ablation, antiarrhythmic surgery) for atrial fibrillation aim to diminish uncomfortable symptoms such as tachycardias and palpitations, by restoring sinus rhythm, improving hemodynamics, reinstituting atrioventricular synchrony and reducing thromboembolic risk by reproducing bi-atrial contraction. The development of open surgical procedures for the Cox-Maze procedure of atrial fibrillation has led to their widespread application during cardiac operations, but their effectiveness and safety have not been rigorously established.

The Cox-Maze procedure (CMP) is one of the most effective surgical treatments for atrial fibrillation (AF). The MAZE operation, as an open-heart surgical procedure, was introduced by James L. Cox in 1987 as a 'cut-and-suture' technique, a technique based on a multiple wavelet theory, which proposes that different depolarizing wavefronts circle the atria. MAZE incisions should reduce the atrial mass below the critical reentry circuit size, preventing atrial fibrillation. The Cox‐Maze IV is currently the gold standard surgical treatment for AF, with estimated freedom from AF and from antiarrhythmic drugs at 1 year postoperatively of 93% and 85%, respectively.

The 2012 Heart Rhythm Society/European Heart Rhythm Society/European Cardiac Arrhythmia Society guidelines recommend AF intervention as an acceptable treatment in symptomatic patients, concomitant to other cardiac surgery (level C evidence). Despite this, many patients with AF undergoing cardiac surgery for other pathologies are not offered a concomitant CMP, whereas other patients with lone AF are not offered surgical intervention at all. Gabriella Boano demonstrated that the current data cannot exclude that the addition of the Cox-Maze IV procedure to MVS increases the risk of PHF (postoperative heart failure), possibly by increasing the cross-clamp time. Moreover, Cox-Maze procedure was associated with an increased risk for permanent pacing, and PPM implantation following MVS was associated with a significant increase in 1 year mortality. It has been estimated that approximately one-third of patients undergoing mitral valve surgery who have a history of AF do not receive the CMP.

The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 2020 Statement was followed in this systematic review and meta-analysis study. Because this study was a systematic review and meta-analysis, patient-informed consent and ethical approval were not required.

Literature search strategy

This systematic review was registered and accepted for inclusion in PROSPERO in July 2023 (PROSPERO ID Number: CRD42023441043). We searched PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Central Register of Clinical Trials (Cochrane Library, Issue 02, 2017) databases from 1987 up to 15th of March 2022. We used the following terms: ('atrial fibrillation' OR AF OR dabigatran OR rivaroxaban OR apixaban) AND (ablation OR 'catheter ablation'). The reference lists of identified articles were also reviewed for additional sources.

Surgical AF ablation terminology and grouping — the document recommends precise use of the term Maze and outlines categories: We recommend that the term "Maze" procedure is appropriately used only to refer to the biatrial lesion set of the Cox-Maze operation; it requires ablation of the RA and LA isthmuses, and less extensive sets should not be called a Maze; in general, surgical AF ablation procedures can be grouped into a full biatrial Cox-Maze procedure, PVI alone, or PVI combined with left atrial lesion sets.

Discussion

Due to the pathomechanism of mitral valve disease, which includes left atrial enlargement due to constant pressure and volume overload, the prevalence of atrial fibrillation is high. The occurrence of AF worsens the hemodynamic tolerance of MS and markedly increases the risk of thromboembolic events. The weight of this evidence has provided the impetus for the combination of surgical AF treatment and mitral valve surgical intervention, with the hope of synergistic improvements in both SR prevalence and risk of morbidity and mortality. A previous meta-analysis that pooled the clinical outcomes of MV alone versus MV + various types of radiofrequency ablation of atrial fibrillation included 4 radiofrequency studies and 3 Cox-Maze studies, as well as 1 cryoablation study, and 1 pulmonary vein isolation study; nevertheless, there is still a lack of research trials or large registries evaluating surgical Cox-Maze techniques according to their various subgroups. The most effective surgical option for the management of AF has been the Cox-Maze procedure (CMP), introduced by James Cox and colleagues in 1987. The outcomes of concomitant Cox‐Maze surgery during MV surgery have been extensively evaluated, but comparative data of Cox‐Maze surgery and no-maze during MVS on the mortality and freedom from AF are still limited.

Surgical ablation terminology and grouping — We recommend that the term Maze procedure is appropriately used only to refer to the biatrial lesion set of the Cox-Maze surgery. It requires ablation of the RA isthmus and the LA isthmus, and less extensive lesion sets should not be referred to as a Maze procedure, but rather as a surgical AF ablation procedure. In general, surgical ablation procedures for AF can be grouped into three different groups: (1) a full biatrial Cox-Maze procedure, (2) pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) alone, and (3) PVI combined with LA lesion sets.

In addition, institutional experience is of paramount importance due to the fact that a center might have higher morbidity or early postoperative mortality while introducing the Cox‐Maze technique. In Von Oppell's study, they started using the monopolar pen to ensure a confluent ablation line between the left pulmonary veins and the mitral valve annulus and the tricuspid valve annulus without potentially injuring coronary arteries after the first three failure patients were treated only with the bipolar device, and could be interpreted as part of 'learning curve'. Surgeons must know the specific characteristics of whatever device they plan to use to create transmural lesions and modify their technique accordingly. If surgeons are able to meet these criteria and increase the appropriate use of this effective surgical treatment, this would make a significant positive impact on patients with AF, not only by restoring sinus rhythm and reducing the risk of stroke but also by improving long-term. Another criticism of port access surgery has been the prolonged CBP and ischemic times, which are associated with centers' experience. Our series is no exception, the reviewed data strongly suggest that CBP time seems to be prolonged with concomitant Cox‐Maze procedure. Therefore, a clear advantage of this technique remains valid for centers with substantial experience in antiarrhythmic surgery.

Limitations

The present analysis has some limitations. Firstly, one thing to keep in mind is that our use of methods adapted from TSA applied to cumulative meta-analysis showed that the current evidence for Cox-Maze procedures maybe insufficient and inconclusive. Secondly, this study included all types of Cox-Maze surgeries, including Cox III, Cox IV, and some different additional surgical approaches, and the surgeon's individual experience at each center may have contributed to the bias, which highlights the need for future RCTs or large registries which evaluate maze ablation techniques according to subgroup. Thirdly, the current trial enrolled a substantial number of patients with "difficult to manage" atrial fibrillation, including elderly patients and patients with atrial fibrillation of relatively long duration before surgery. These factors have been associated with a reduced likelihood of ablation success. Fourthly, mitral valve replacement was higher than mitral valve repair in patients who underwent repeat mitral valve surgery, and we are not certain of the impact of these two subgroups on outcomes; subgroup analyses need to be performed by including a larger sample size of RCTs.

Section 5: Strategies, Techniques, and Endpoints

Historical Considerations

Cox and colleagues are credited with developing and demonstrating the efficacy of surgical ablation of AF. Subsequent surgeons evaluated the efficacy of surgical approaches that limit the lesion set to PVI. The final iteration of the procedure developed by Cox, which is referred to as the MAZE-3 procedure, was based on a model of AF in which maintenance of the arrhythmia was shown to require a critical number of circulating wavelets for reentry. The success of the Maze-3 procedure in the early 1990s led some cardiac electrophysiologists to attempt to reproduce the procedure with RF catheter ablation. Swartz and colleagues reported replication of the MAZE-1 lesion set in a small series of patients using specially designed sheaths and standard RF ablation catheters. The efficacy was modest, the complication rate was high, and the procedure and fluoroscopy times were long. As a result, this approach was quickly abandoned. This report demonstrated a proof of concept that motivated others to try to improve catheter-based ablative treatment of AF. Subsequently, a large number of investigators attempted to replicate the surgical MAZE procedure through the use of either three-dimensional (3D) mapping systems or the use of multipolar ablation catheters. These clinical trials had limited success. Based on these observations and the rapid advances in ablation of AF targeting focal triggers that initiate AF in the PVs, electrophysiologists lost interest in linear non-PV-based approaches to catheter ablation of AF that attempted to replicate various aspects of the surgical MAZE procedure.

### Atrial fibrillation: current surgical options and their assessment [^4e2e99c9]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2002). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia and is associated with morbidity and mortality. Traditional surgical treatment of AF is the Cox-Maze III procedure, a complicated operation. New surgical approaches include alternate energy sources (radiofrequency, microwave, cryothermy) and simplified left atrial lesion sets. These operations cure AF in 70% to 80% of patients. This review describes contemporary and emerging surgical approaches to AF, synthesizes results of these operations, and proposes new standards for reporting results of AF treatment.

### The cox maze IV procedure: predictors of late recurrence [^c83b939e]. The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Objectives

The Cox maze III procedure achieved high cure rates and became the surgical gold standard for the treatment of atrial fibrillation. Because of its invasiveness, a more simplified ablation-assisted procedure, the Cox maze IV procedure, has been performed at our institution since January 2002. The study examined multiple preoperative and perioperative variables to determine predictors of late recurrence.

Methods

Data were collected prospectively on 282 patients who underwent the Cox maze IV procedure from January 2002 through December 2009. Forty-two percent of patients had paroxysmal and 58% had either persistent or long-standing persistent atrial fibrillation. All patients were available for follow-up. Follow-up included electrocardiograms in all patients. Since 2006, 24-hour Holter monitoring was obtained in 94% of patients at 3, 6, and 12 months. Data were analyzed by means of logistic regression analysis at 12 months, with 13 preoperative and perioperative variables used as covariates.

Results

Sixty-six percent of patients had a concomitant procedure. After an ablation-assisted Cox maze procedure, the freedom from atrial fibrillation was 89%, 93%, and 89% at 3, 6, and 12 months, respectively. The freedom from both atrial fibrillation and antiarrhythmic drugs was 63%, 79%, and 78% at 3, 6, and 12 months, respectively. The risk factors for atrial fibrillation recurrence at 1 year were enlarged left atrial diameter (P = 0.027), failure to isolate the entire posterior left atrium (P = 0.022), and early atrial tachyarrhythmias (P = 0.010).

Conclusions

The Cox maze IV procedure has a high success rate at 1 year, even with improved follow-up and stricter definitions of failure. In patients with large left atria, there might be a need for more extensive size reduction or expanded lesion sets.

Cox-Maze outcomes and complications — In ablation-assisted Cox-Maze experiences, in the entire patient cohort, 89% of patients were in sinus rhythm with or without antiarrhythmic drug therapy, and 78% were in sinus rhythm and free of antiarrhythmic drug therapy at 12-month follow-up. Monitoring included Holter monitors every three months in 70% of patients, with major complications in 11% including an operative mortality of 2% and a 1.7% incidence of stroke, and pacemakers implanted in 9% post operatively.

### Atrial fibrillation in heart failure: what should we do? [^301cf10d]. European Heart Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Recognizing the limitations of percutaneous ablation in patients with more advanced forms of AF, there are emerging alternative approaches to catheter ablation, including both surgical ablation and hybrid ablation. In the 'convergent' procedure, a surgical transdiaphragmatic endoscopic approach is used to make non-contiguous epicardial ablation lesions. These lesions are later completed with catheter ablation to produce complete pulmonary vein isolation. In one study of 101 patients, in which 30% had symptomatic HF, freedom from AF was 66% at 1 year with a major complication rate of 6%. More traditional surgical ablation, like the Cox-Maze procedure, also has a role, particularly when HF patients with symptomatic AF are undergoing surgery for valvular disease or revascularization. Preliminary data in patients with concomitant HF suggests that Cox-Maze procedures may be effective and safe in those with LVEF < 40% and symptomatic HF, with sinus rhythm maintained in > 80% at 6-month follow-up.

### Guidelines for reporting data and outcomes for the surgical treatment of atrial fibrillation [^4c6781cc]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation is the most common sustained cardiac rhythm disturbance, affecting an estimated 2.5 million people in the United States. Atrial fibrillation may occur with or without structural heart disease. The medical and surgical literature has seen an exponential growth in reports of ablation techniques and the Cox-Maze procedure to treat atrial fibrillation. There has been no agreement or standards on the proper reporting of these techniques and results. The current literature is in disarray, and this report is an attempt to provide a framework for the necessary elements to be included in reports on this subject. The Workforce on Evidence Based Surgery of the Society of Thoracic Surgeons encourages the adoption of these guidelines for reporting clinical results derived from patients undergoing surgical procedures for atrial fibrillation. Adoption of these guidelines will greatly facilitate the comparison between the reported experiences of various authors treating different cohorts of patients at different times with different techniques and energy sources. These guidelines are also appropriate for catheter-based treatment of atrial fibrillation. Thus, more reliable evaluation and comparisons of results will advance our knowledge and further the development and application of these procedures.

### Association of operative risk with the outcome of concomitant cox maze procedure: a comparison of results across risk groups [^48b73a46]. The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Objectives

Cardiac surgery patients with atrial fibrillation face increased risks for perioperative morbidity and decreased survival, yet only 39% of patients presenting with atrial fibrillation undergo concomitant surgical ablation. This low percentage may relate to the perception of lower yield for surgical ablation, especially in patients with complex clinical presentations. In this study, we compared outcomes after a concomitant Cox maze III/IV procedure in patients with high, intermediate, and low predicted operative risk.

Methods

Outcome data were prospectively captured after surgery. The additive European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation (EuroSCORE) was greater than 6 for high-risk patients (n = 145), 3 or less for low-risk patients (n = 76), and greater than 3 and 6 or less for intermediate-risk patients (n = 149).

Results

No differences were found for perioperative morbidities, including operative mortality (high vs low risk, 2% vs 1%, P = 1.00; high vs intermediate risk, 2% vs 0.7%, P = 0.37). Median length of stay was longer in high-risk patients versus low-risk patients (8 vs 5 days, P < .001) and intermediate-risk patients (8 vs 6 days, P < .001). Return to sinus rhythm was comparable for high-risk versus low- and intermediate-risk patients at 6, 12, and 24 months. Physical health-related quality of life scores improved similarly for all groups at 12 months. No difference in long-term survival was found (log rank = 0.40; P = 0.82).

Conclusions

The Cox maze III/IV procedure can be performed safely and effectively in patients with higher operative risk, who fare well when compared with lower-risk patients. The Cox maze III/IV procedure should be considered carefully in patients with a significant history of atrial fibrillation.

Regarding surgical interventions for atrial fibrillation, more specifically with respect to surgical ablation, STS 2024 guidelines recommend to consider performing surgical ablation for symptomatic persistent or long-standing persistent AF in the absence of structural heart disease as a stand-alone procedure using the Cox-Maze III/IV lesion set as the preferred procedure.

### The cox maze III procedure for atrial fibrillation: long-term efficacy in patients undergoing lone versus concomitant procedures [^32d7a759]. The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2003). Low credibility.

Background

For the last decade, the Cox maze III procedure has been available for the treatment of atrial fibrillation. It is unknown whether the operation has similar efficacy in patients with lone atrial fibrillation compared with that in patients with atrial fibrillation associated with coronary, valve, or congenital heart disease. This study examined the long-term outcome of patients who underwent this procedure either as a lone operation or as a concomitant procedure.

Methods

From 1988 to 2001, 198 patients underwent a Cox maze III procedure; 112 were lone operations, and 86 were concomitant procedures. Major complications included renal failure, reoperation for bleeding, mediastinitis, stroke, and balloon pump insertion. Follow-up was performed by means of mail and telephone questionnaires with both the patients and their cardiologists. All patients who had any history of arrhythmia or who were taking medication had their rhythm documented by means of electrocardiography.

Results

The lone operation group was significantly younger (51.3 ± 10.5 vs 58.8 ± 9.9 years) and had a higher male/female ratio (4:1 vs 2:1). There was no difference in operative mortality between groups (1.8% vs 1.2%). At a follow-up of 5.4 ± 2.9 years, 96.6% (172/178) of all patients were free of atrial fibrillation. There was no difference between the lone operation and concomitant procedure groups (95.9% vs 97.5%).

Conclusion

The Cox maze III procedure has equivalent operative risk and long-term efficacy in patients undergoing both lone operations and concomitant procedures. The Cox maze III procedure remains the standard against which alternative procedures for atrial fibrillation must be judged.

### Safety and efficacy of cox-maze procedure for atrial fibrillation during mitral valve surgery: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^591b65b9]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

The aim of any atrial fibrillation surgery is to diminish uncomfortable symptoms of the arrhythmia by restoring sinus rhythm, reinstituting atrioventricular synchrony, and reducing the risk of thromboembolic complications. Restoration of atrial transport function to improve hemodynamics is another important goal of the Maze procedure. Poor left atrial contractility can cause a decrease in cardiac output of as much as 30%. Atrial transport function can be restored in 70% to 100% of patients after the Maze procedure. In this systematic review, we investigated the comparison of mid‐term clinical outcomes between MV + Cox-Maze versus MV alone.

Given that AF has consistently been shown to be an independent predictor of mortality, the maintenance of SR is vital for quality of life and survival. Khiabani's survival analysis has previously shown a survival benefit to performing concomitant AF Cox-Maze procedure as opposed to not treating the AF but this also suggests a further benefit to successful restoration of sinus rhythm, over and above that seen with just managing the left atrial appendage (LAA). As such, the prevalence of SR at both short- and long-term follow-up is the most important endpoint considered for AF patients. Although selected single-center studies have shown rates of post-ablation freedom from atrial fibrillation of 80% or more, 1 year estimates of approximately 70% are more typical. As compared with long-term monitoring, spot ECG recordings tend to overestimate success by approximately 12 percentage points. Our results demonstrate significant improvement in the restoration of SR in the Cox-Maze group compared to the control group at discharge (66.5% vs. 18.7%), 6 months (75.5% vs. 24.2%), and 12 months (67.1% vs. 21.4%) follow-up periods. These results are consistent with previous meta-analyses involving mixed surgical populations.

### A new era in the surgical treatment of atrial fibrillation: the impact of ablation technology and lesion set on procedural efficacy [^36abb7e5]. Annals of Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Background/Objective

While the Cox-Maze procedure remains the gold standard for the surgical treatment of atrial fibrillation (AF), the use of ablation technology has revolutionized the field. To simplify the procedure, our group has replaced most of the incisions with bipolar radiofrequency ablation lines. The purpose of this study was to examine results using bipolar radiofrequency in 130 patients undergoing a full Cox-Maze procedure, a limited Cox-Maze procedure, or pulmonary vein isolation alone.

Methods

A retrospective review was performed of patients who underwent a Cox-Maze procedure (n = 100), utilizing bipolar radiofrequency ablation, a limited Cox-Maze procedure (n = 7), or pulmonary vein isolation alone (n = 23). Follow-up was available on 129 of 130 patients (99%).

Results

Pulmonary vein isolation was confirmed by intraoperative pacing in all patients. Cross-clamp time in the lone Cox-Maze procedure patients was 44 ± 21 minutes, and 104 ± 42 minutes for the Cox-Maze procedure with a concomitant procedure, which was shortened considerably from our traditional cut-and-sew Cox-Maze procedure times (P < 0.05). There were 4 postoperative deaths in the Cox-Maze procedure group and 1 in the pulmonary vein isolation group. The mean follow-up was 13 ± 10, 23 ± 15, and 9 ± 10 months for the Cox-Maze IV, the pulmonary vein isolation, and the limited Cox-Maze procedure groups, respectively. At last follow-up, freedom from AF was 90% (85 of 94), 86% (6 of 7), and 59% (10 of 17) in the in the Cox-Maze procedure group, limited Cox-Maze procedure group, and pulmonary vein isolation alone group, respectively.

Conclusions

The use of bipolar radiofrequency ablation to replace Cox-Maze incisions was safe and effective at controlling AF. Pulmonary vein isolation alone was much less effective, and should be used cautiously in this population.

### 2017 HRS / EHRA / ECAS / APHRS / SOLAECE expert consensus statement on catheter and surgical ablation of atrial fibrillation [^a0dbe251]. Heart Rhythm (2017). Low credibility.

With the introduction of new ablation technology, including bipolar RF energy and new cryoablation systems, there has been renewed interest in less invasive procedures for stand-alone AF ablation. These new tools can be used in the open chest or through small incisions between the ribs. When used in the open chest with a full biatrial Cox-Maze lesion set performed, the procedure has been termed the Cox-Maze IV procedure. Techniques for a Cox-Maze IV procedure through a small, right inframammary incision have also been perfected. As noted in the earlier section on new surgical ablation technology, the outcomes achieved with the Cox-Maze IV procedure are similar to those achieved with the earlier Cox-Maze procedure. Importantly, the cross-clamp times are shorter with the Cox-Maze IV procedure. The advantage of these approaches includes the ability to reliably create the endocardial lesions of the Maze, down to the mitral annulus. Late evaluation of this procedure in 146 stand-alone patients has shown a 72% freedom from AF at 5 years of follow-up and a 59% freedom from AF off antiarrhythmic medications. Cryothermia alone has been used and described in a series of 77 patients, with a 6-month result of 88% freedom from AF, antiarrhythmic medications, and anticoagulants, but late follow-up is lacking.

### Impact of cox maze procedure on outcome in patients with atrial fibrillation and mitral valve disease [^2a21250f]. The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

We sought to determine whether the Cox maze procedure provides additional benefit to patients with atrial fibrillation undergoing mitral valve operations.

Methods

Between May 1992 and August 2000, we performed 258 Cox maze procedures with mitral valve replacement (n = 147) or mitral valve repair (n = 111). We compared the outcomes of these patients with those of 61 control patients with preoperative atrial fibrillation who underwent mitral valve replacement alone during the same interval. The three cohorts were similar in age, sex, and proportion of patients in preoperative New York Heart Association functional class 3 or 4.

Results

Although 5-year survivals were similar among the groups (94% for mitral valve replacement alone, 95% for mitral valve replacement plus maze, and 97% for mitral valve repair plus maze), freedoms from atrial fibrillation at 5 years were significantly higher in the mitral valve replacement plus maze group (78%) and the mitral valve repair plus maze group (81%) than in the mitral valve replacement group (6%, P < .0001). Freedoms from stroke at 5 years were 97% for the mitral valve replacement plus maze group, 97% for the mitral valve repair plus maze group, and only 79% for mitral valve replacement group (P < .0001). Multivariable analysis with Cox hazard model revealed that the most significant risk factor for late stroke was the omission of the Cox maze procedure (P = 0.003).

Conclusions

The addition of the Cox maze procedure to mitral valve repair and replacement was safe and effective for selected patients. Elimination of atrial fibrillation significantly decreased the incidence of late stroke.

### Surgical treatment of atrial fibrillation in elderly patients undergoing high risk cardiac surgery [^a543e0ac]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Evaluating outcomes of concurrent Cox-Maze procedures in elderly patients undergoing high-risk cardiac surgery.

Mehods

We retrospectively identified patients aged over 70 years with Atrial Fibrillation (AF) from 2011 to 2017 who had two or more other cardiac procedures. They were subdivided into two groups: 1. Cox-Maze IV AF ablation. 2. No-Surgical AF treatment. A propensity match score was used to generate a homogeneous cohort and to eliminate confounding variables. Heart rhythm was assessed from Holter reports or 12-lead ECG. Follow-up data was collected through telephone consultations and medical records.

Results

There were 239 patients. Median follow up was 61 months. 70 patients had Cox-Maze IV procedures (29.3%). Demographic, intra- and post-operative outcomes were similar between groups although duration of pre-operative AF was shorter in Cox-Maze group (p = 0.001). There was no significant 30-day mortality difference in propensity matched cohorts (n = 84. P = 0.078). Sinus rhythm at annual and latest follow-up was 84.9% and 80.0% respectively in Maze group – 160 patients (66.9%) were alive at long-term follow-up with good survival outcomes in Cox Maze group. There was a high proportion of patients in NYHA 1 status in Cox-Maze group. No differences observed in freedom from stroke (p = 0.80) or permanent pacemaker (p = 0.33) between the groups.

Conclusions

Surgical ablation is beneficial in elderly patients undergoing high-risk surgery - promoting excellent long-term freedom from AF and symptomatic / prognostic benefits, without added risk. Therefore, surgical risk should not be reason to deny benefits of concomitant AF-ablation.

Clinical trial registration

Not required.

Section 12: Surgical and Hybrid AF Ablation

Historical Considerations and Development of the Cox-Maze Procedure

There is a rich history of surgery for AF. Initial procedures were aimed at controlling the ventricular response rate. Later procedures were directed at converting AF to a normal sinus rhythm. Following experimental investigation, the Maze procedure was introduced for the surgical treatment of AF in 1987 by James Cox. This procedure was designed to interrupt macroreentrant circuits, thereby reducing the ability of the atrium to fibrillate. Fortuitously, the surgery also isolated all of the PVs and the posterior LA. In contrast to previous procedures, such as the corridor procedure and LA transection procedures, the Cox-Maze procedure successfully restored both AV synchrony and sinus rhythm and decreased the incidence of late stroke. This effect was attributed to both AF control and amputation of the LAA. The surgery involved creating multiple strategically placed incisions across both the RA and LA. The surgical incisions were placed so that the sinus node could "direct" the propagation of the sinus impulse throughout both atria. It also allowed most of the atrial myocardium to be activated, resulting in preservation of atrial transport function in most patients. The final iteration of this procedure, the Cox-Maze III, became the standard for the surgical treatment of AF.

Long-term outcomes of 198 patients who underwent the Cox-Maze III procedure for treatment of paroxysmal (n = 113) or persistent or long-standing persistent AF (n = 85) have been reported. The mean follow-up was 5.4 6 2.9 years. Among the 112 patients who underwent surgery only for AF treatment, 96% were in sinus rhythm with or without AAD therapy and 80% were in sinus rhythm and free of AAD therapy at the last follow-up. Among the 86 patients who underwent AF surgery in conjunction with other cardiac surgery, 97% were in sinus rhythm with or without AAD therapy and 73% were in sinus rhythm free of AAD therapy. The incidence of major complications among the 112 patients who only underwent AF surgery was 11%. Among these were two perioperative deaths and two perioperative strokes or TIAs. Nine patients (8%) required pacemaker placement. The incidence of major complications among the 86 patients who underwent AF surgery at the time of other cardiac surgical procedures was 14%. Among these were one perioperative death and one perioperative stroke. Twenty patients (23%) required pacemaker placement.

Stand-alone operations for atrial fibrillation — Cox-Maze III series outcomes are reported: Among 112 patients undergoing the Cox-Maze III procedure, 96% were in sinus rhythm with or without antiarrhythmic drug therapy, and 80% were in sinus rhythm and free of antiarrhythmic drug therapy at last follow-up; there was one late stroke and 88% of patients were off chronic anticoagulation at last follow-up. The only risk factor for late recurrence was the preoperative duration of AF.

### Cox-maze III procedure for atrial fibrillation during valve surgery: a single institution experience [^664ed6ec]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

In this trial, we found that the rate of freedom from atrial fibrillation in 24 months after Cox maze III procedure was over 90%. In recent years, new technologies and approaches to surgical AF ablation have been evolved to simplified lesion sets and shorten the time, but the issue of ensuring completely transmural lesions remains unresolved. In a randomized multicenter trial involving patients with persistent or long-standing persistent AF who were undergoing mitral-valve surgery, Gillinov AM et al. reported the freedom from AF in the first year after surgery was 63.2% in the ablation procedures (pulmonary-vein isolation or biatrial maze procedure) group. The "cut-and-sew" maze III operation can assure the transmurality and eliminates this concern. Stulak et al. reported the patients undergoing the Cox maze III procedure concurrent with isolated mitral valve surgery resulted in significantly greater freedom from AF without antiarrhythmic medication compared with any other procedure for AF ablation within 1 year postoperatively (87% vs 70%, P = 0.04) and after 5 years postoperatively (75% vs 52%, P = 0.03). Many of the studies have shown for both catheter and surgical ablation that left atrial enlargement is a predictor of failure. The study reported by Ishii Y revealed that preoperative LAD of ≧58.0 mm was a significant risk factor for an AF recurrence after full maze procedure, including cut and sew procedure and device ablation. In their report, the AF cure rates were 85, 59, and 42% at 1, 5, and 10 years in the population who had a LAD = 64.2 mm (58.0–82.0 mm). However, in the population who had a LAD = 54.2 (52.0–57.0 mm), the AF cure rates were 99, 85, and 68% at 1, 5, and 10 years. It is interesting that the data of this population was similar to this trial, so we compared them as shown in Table 5. In the present trial, the mean diameter of preoperative left atrial was 53 mm, and the mean LVEF was 55.7%. These factors might have improved the likelihood of ablation success in our study. Meanwhile, the LAD ranged from 40 to 70 mm, and about 30% patients's LAD were larger than 58.0 mm in this trial, which might contribute to the results that AF cure rates are just between the above two groups.

Objective

The effects of the Cox maze procedure on atrial function remain poorly defined. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of a modified Cox maze procedure on left and right atrial function in a porcine model.

After cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, 6 pigs underwent pericardiotomy (sham group), and 6 pigs underwent a modified Cox maze procedure (maze group) with bipolar radiofrequency ablation. The maze group had preablation and immediate postablation left and right atrial pressure-volume relations measured with conductance catheters. All pigs survived for 30 days. Magnetic resonance imaging was then repeated for both groups, and conductance catheter measurements were repeated for the right atrium in the maze group.

Results

Both groups had significantly higher left atrial volumes postoperatively. Magnetic resonance imaging-derived reservoir and booster pump functional parameters were reduced postoperatively for both groups, but there was no difference in these parameters between the groups. The maze group had significantly higher reduction in the medial and lateral left atrial wall contraction postoperatively. There was no change in immediate left atrial elastance or in the early and 30-day right atrial elastance after the Cox maze procedure. Although the initial left atrial stiffness increased after ablation, right atrial diastolic stiffness did not change initially or at 30 days.

Conclusions

Performing a pericardiotomy alone had a significant effect on atrial function that can be quantified by means of magnetic resonance imaging. The effects of the Cox maze procedure on left atrial function could only be detected by analyzing segmental wall motion. Understanding the precise physiologic effects of the Cox maze procedure on atrial function will help in developing less-damaging lesion sets for the surgical treatment of atrial fibrillation.

Cox-Maze IV surgical ablation — In a series using the Cox-Maze IV lesion set, baseline characteristics and outcomes are detailed, including concomitant valve surgery, adverse events, pacemaker implantation, and atrial fibrillation (AF) freedom at follow-up. The median patient age was 72 years, the median EF was 50%, and the median LA size was 6 cm; 56% of patients underwent valve surgery alone or in conjunction with CABG. The incidence of major adverse events was 9%, including death in 2 patients (3.6%), major bleeding in 2 patients (3.6%), and stroke in one patient (1.8%). In addition to these major complications, 25% of the patients required implantation of a permanent pacemaker for AV node dysfunction (8.3%) or sinus node dysfunction (17%). The effectiveness of the procedure was assessed in 50 evaluable patients; at 6 months, 74% were AF-free and off antiarrhythmic drug (AAD) therapy and 84% were free of AF on or off AAD therapy, and freedom from AF at 12 months was 75%.

Surgical and hybrid AF ablation — Cox-Maze history and outcomes: Following experimental investigation, the Maze procedure was introduced for the surgical treatment of AF in 1987 by James Cox. Long-term outcomes of 198 patients who underwent the Cox-Maze III for paroxysmal (n = 113) or persistent or long-standing persistent AF (n = 85) have been reported; the mean follow-up was 5.4 ± 2.9 years. Among the 112 patients who underwent surgery only for AF treatment, 96% were in sinus rhythm with or without AAD therapy at last follow-up, whereas among the 86 patients who underwent AF surgery in conjunction with other cardiac surgery and were available for follow-up, 88% were in sinus rhythm with or without AAD therapy at last follow-up. The incidence of major complications among the 112 patients who underwent only AF surgery was 11%, including two perioperative deaths and two perioperative strokes or TIAs, and nine patients (8%) required pacemaker placement; for the 86 patients who had AF surgery at the time of other cardiac surgical procedures, the incidence of major complications was 14%, including one perioperative death and one perioperative stroke, and twenty patients (23%) required pacemaker placement.

Study selection and outcomes

After deduplication, study eligibility was assessed independently by two investigators reviewing each retrieved article (H Luo and R Yang). Any discrepancies were resolved by discussion and consensus between the three investigators (H Luo, R Yang and Y Gao). The final results were reviewed by the senior investigator (H Cao). The studies were selected through the following two levels of screening: in the first step studies were independently screened based on titles and abstracts, and in the second step, full‐text reports were evaluated based on predefined criteria. Studies were eligible in patient cohorts who underwent mitral valve surgery concomitantly with the treatment of AF, which utilized Cox-Maze application, including Cox-Maze III (cut and sew), Cox-Maze (IV), or individualized modified Cox-Maze procedures (radiofrequency ablation, cryoablation, and microwave ablation), and met the following inclusion criteria:
Population: adults or adolescents (12 years or older);
Comparator: Cox-Maze procedures versus no-maze procedures in AF patients undergoing mitral valve surgery
Provided outcomes: death, sinus rhythm at 12‐months follow‐up;
Design: RCT with at least 10 patients per treatment of interest;
Published in English language and to those involving human subjects, Abstracts, case reports, conference presentations, editorials, and expert opinions were excluded.

Studies were ineligible if they had follow‐up shorter than 12 months and if they were duplicates. For studies reported in more than one publication, or when institutions reported subsequent studies with accumulating numbers of patients or increased lengths of follow‐up, only the most complete reports (in terms of reported outcomes and control of confounding) were included.

The primary outcomes were recurrence of AF and mortality after a 12‐month follow‐up. The secondary outcomes included aortic cross‐clamp time (XCT), CBP time, rate of MV repair, and duration of preoperative AF.

Data extraction and critical appraisal

We assessed and extracted data on study characteristics, patients' baseline data, and data regarding study outcomes independently by two investigators (H Luo and R Yang) with verification for accuracy by two other investigators (Y Gao and W Xie). The investigators looked for information on the sources of funding for individual studies included in the review, but it was not required to be reported. Digitizing software was used to recover graphically presented data. Where necessary, study authors were contacted to obtain additional information.

### Late outcomes after the cox maze IV procedure for atrial fibrillation [^6e604af9]. The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

The Cox maze IV procedure (CMPIV) has been established as the gold standard for surgical ablation; however, late outcomes using current consensus definitions of treatment failure have not been well described. To compare to reported outcomes of catheter-based ablation, we report our institutional outcomes of patients who underwent a left-sided or biatrial CMPIV at 5 years of follow-up.

Methods

Between January 2002 and September 2014, data were collected prospectively on 576 patients with AF who underwent a CMPIV (n = 532) or left-sided CMPIV (n = 44). Perioperative variables and long-term freedom from AF, with and without AADs, were compared in multiple subgroups.

Results

Follow-up at any time point was 89%. At 5 years, overall freedom from AF was 93 of 119 (78%), and freedom from AF off AADs was 77 of 177 (66%). No differences were found in freedom from AF, with or without AADs, at 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 years for patients with paroxysmal AF (n = 204) versus with persistent/longstanding persistent AF (n = 305), or for those who underwent standalone versus a concomitant CMP. Duration of preoperative AF and hospital length of stay were the best predictors of failure at 5 years.

Conclusions

The outcomes of the CMPIV remain good at late follow-up. The type of preoperative AF or the addition of a concomitant procedure did not affect late success. The results of the CMPIV remain superior to those reported for catheter ablation and other forms of surgical AF ablation, especially for patients with persistent or longstanding AF.

### The impact of the cox-maze technique on freedom from atrial fibrillation [^8599f98e]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia observed with concomitant cardiac surgery. Surgical options include a cut-and-sew technique Maze (CAS) and a cryoablation/bipolar technique Maze (CB). There are limited data comparing the long-term outcomes of these 2 techniques.

Methods

All patients who underwent either CAS or CB Maze between 2011 and 2018 were included in the study. Chi-square test and Fisher's exact test or Student's t test were used to compare differences between baseline characteristics. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were generated for each group. Cumulative incidence functions were generated for AF recurrence and Fine-Gray competing-risk regression was used to determine predictors for AF recurrence.

Results

A total of 482 patients underwent open surgical ablation. Of those, 287 had CAS and 198 had CB. All procedures were concomitant with cardiac surgery. There was similar long-term mortality between the CAS and CB cohorts (22.3% vs 17.4%; log-rank P = 0.91). There was no difference in pacemaker implantation (11.1% vs 11.3%; P = 0.813) or long-term freedom from AF recurrence (73.3% vs 78.2%; P = 0.294). On Fine-Gray competing-risk regression, New York Heart Association functional class IV (hazard ratio [HR], 2.07; P = 0.03), concomitant aortic valve replacement (HR, 3.02; P = 0.01), and concomitant CABG + valve (HR, 2.36; P = 0.02) were significant independent predictors for AF recurrence; Maze type was not a predictor.

Conclusions

These data indicate no difference between the CAS vs CB with respect to freedom from long-term AF. Both techniques may be appropriate based on surgeon experience and patient characteristics.

### The cox maze procedure in mitral valve disease: predictors of recurrent atrial fibrillation [^108f685c]. The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

Objectives

The Cox maze procedure is the gold standard for ablation of atrial fibrillation in patients undergoing mitral valve surgery, and new approaches to atrial fibrillation ablation must be compared with it. Therefore, we sought to determine the time-related prevalence of atrial fibrillation and its risk factors after combined Cox maze and mitral valve surgery.

Methods

From November 1991 through January 2004, 263 patients (mean left atrial diameter, 5.8 ± 1.2 cm) underwent combined mitral valve surgery (repair in 71%) and a cut-and-sew Cox maze procedure for atrial fibrillation (permanent, 74%; persistent, 7%; paroxysmal, 16%). Rhythm documented on 2367 postoperative electrocardiograms was used to estimate the prevalence of atrial fibrillation across time.

Results

Hospital mortality was 1.9%. Postoperative atrial fibrillation prevalence peaked at 36% at 2 weeks, decreasing to 21% at 5 years. Risk factors for higher postoperative atrial fibrillation prevalence varied with time and included longer duration of preoperative atrial fibrillation (P = 0.003), larger left atrial diameter (P = 0.01), older age (P = 0.0002), and higher left ventricular mass index (P = 0.02).

Conclusions

In some patients undergoing mitral valve surgery and a Cox maze procedure, atrial fibrillation recurs over time, mandating close, long-term follow-up of heart rhythm. Earlier operation and left atrial size reduction should be considered to improve results in selected patients.

Introduction

Robotic cryothermic Cox-Maze (CM) IV is a minimally invasive procedure that reliably replicates the biatrial lesion set of the CM III by utilizing cryothermia as a single power source.

Methods

Herein we describe a step by step creation of the biatrial CM III lesion sets utilizing the minimally invasive robotic platform.

Results

Technical details are reviewed for this single incision, single stage, highly effective option for stand-alone or concomitant surgical ablation of atrial fibrillation (AF).

Conclusion

Robotic cryothermic CM IV can be safely performed as a stand-alone or concomitant procedure, and offers a comprehensive surgical ablation solution for patients with AF.

### 2017 HRS / EHRA / ECAS / APHRS / SOLAECE expert consensus statement on catheter and surgical ablation of atrial fibrillation [^c582b6a6]. Heart Rhythm (2017). Low credibility.

In considering the results of these early reports of cardiac surgery for treatment of AF, it is now recognized that these patients did not undergo rigorous follow-up by present standards. Rhythms were documented by means of a mailed questionnaire, telephone interview, and/or an ECG for documentation. It is clear that the pioneering work of Cox and his team paved the way for the current, less invasive Cox-Maze IV surgery and other surgical approaches for AF ablation, as well as the field of endocardial catheter ablation of AF.

The term lone AF holds different meanings in EP jargon compared with surgical jargon. Electrophysiologists refer to lone AF when there is no other structural heart disease present. Surgeons often refer to a lone AF procedure as one in which the only surgical procedure performed is the ablation as opposed to a concomitant procedure. To eliminate confusion, we recommend that surgeons avoid using lone AF to describe populations of AF patients, and furthermore, we recommend the term stand-alone ablation when no other concomitant procedure is performed at the same operative encounter. As noted earlier in the document, the writing group recommends that the term lone AF not be used in any context related to AF or AF ablation.

Surgical Ablation Technology

Despite its efficacy, the Cox-Maze procedure did not gain widespread application due to its complexity, technical difficulty, and morbidity. The development and subsequent availability of technology to perform atrial ablation allowed surgeons to replace some of the traditional cut-and-sew lesions with ablation lines using this technology. The simplified Cox-Maze procedure lessened procedural morbidity, thus leading to wider adoption and extending its benefits to more patients. Although a variety of energy sources for ablation were initially developed, only cryothermy and RF energy delivery have emerged as practical and efficacious. The only surgical ablation system approved and specifically labeled for surgical AF ablation is the Atricure Ablation System, which includes a number of ablation tools, including a bipolar RF clamp.

Cryothermy can be thought of as nondirectional (although shielding mechanisms can be employed), whereas RF is a directional source. The RF technologies can be organized into two major groups: unipolar and bipolar. Bipolar RF can be directional bipolar or constrained bipolar. The directional bipolar devices have two side-by-side poles that are applied to the tissue surface, with the energy passing through the tissue between them. As the tissue between the poles desiccates and the impedance rises, the energy passes deeper into healthy tissue, with the goal of tissue transmurality.

### The effect of the cox-maze procedure for atrial fibrillation concomitant to mitral and tricuspid valve surgery [^7327dcb6]. The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Objectives

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is associated with less favorable outcomes in patients undergoing mitral valve and tricuspid valve surgery. Despite growing evidence on the potential benefits of surgical ablation for AF there is significant variability among surgeons in treatment of AF. The purpose of our study was to assess the effect of the Cox-maze procedure on operative and follow-up outcomes.

Methods

In our prospective study, patients who underwent isolated mitral valve or mitral valve+tricuspid valve surgery without history of AF (n = 506), with untreated AF (n = 75), or with Cox-maze procedure (n = 236) were included (N = 817). Sinus rhythm was captured according to Heart Rhythm Society guidelines. Patients who underwent the Cox-maze procedure were propensity score matched to patients without history of AF resulting in 208 pairs of patients.

Results

Operative outcomes were comparable after propensity score matching (Cox-maze procedure vs no AF) stroke/transient ischemic attack (0.5% vs 0.5%; P = 1.00), renal failure (2.9% vs 1.4%; P = 0.34), and operative mortality (1.4% vs 1.4%; P = 1.00). High return to sinus rhythm was documented at 6, 12, and 24 months (92%, 91%, and 86%, respectively) as well as sinus rhythm off antiarrhythmic drugs (79%, 84%, and 82%, respectively). Incidence of embolic stroke in patients who underwent Cox-maze procedure was 1.7% (4 out of 232 patients) and 5.1 cases per 1000 person-years. No difference in 4-year cumulative survival between propensity score-matched groups (91.9% vs 86.9%; log rank, 1.67; P = 0.20), but higher for patients who underwent Cox-maze procedure versus patients with untreated AF (hazard ratio, 2.47; P = 0.048). Higher additive European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation (odds ratio, 1.40; P < .001) and limited surgeon experience with Cox-maze procedure (odds ratio, 3.60; P < .001) were significant predictors for failure to perform Cox-maze procedure.

Conclusions

In our center, 76% of patients undergoing mitral valve or mitral valve+tricuspid valve surgery experiencing AF underwent concomitant Cox-maze procedure, which is considerably higher than the national average. No increased morbidity was associated with the Cox-maze procedure with the benefit of very low thromboembolic rate. These results suggest the need for performance-based education for AF surgical ablation to achieve optimal outcomes.

Europace (2012). Medium credibility.

Appropriate selection of patients for procedures — The trainee should also develop the judgment to decide whether conscious sedation or general anesthesia would be most appropriate for the case under consideration. It is also important to assess the severity of symptoms related to AF and the potential benefit of an ablation procedure. Trainees should be experienced in counseling patients about the potential risks and benefits of an ablation procedure and should be able to apply this knowledge for recommendations specific to the needs of individual patients. They should also take into consideration the prior use of antiarrhythmic drugs and pharmacologic alternatives to ablation of AF. It is also important for electrophysiologists involved with catheter ablation to be knowledgeable about surgical ablation techniques for AF, and electrophysiologists who perform AF ablation procedures must be aware of the indications, techniques, and outcomes of surgical approaches for ablation of AF, including the new minimally invasive surgical approaches, AF surgery combined with other cardiac surgical procedures, and the Cox-Maze-III procedure.

### Incremental risk of the cox-maze IV procedure for patients with atrial fibrillation undergoing mitral valve surgery [^4d3c42aa]. The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

More than 50% of atrial fibrillation surgery occurs in the setting of mitral valve surgery. Despite this, no risk models have been validated for concomitant arrhythmia surgery. The purpose of the present study was to quantify the additional risk of performing the Cox-maze IV procedure for patients undergoing mitral valve surgery.

Methods

From January 2002 to June 2011, 213 patients with mitral valve disease and preoperative atrial fibrillation underwent mitral valve surgery only (n = 109) or in conjunction with a Cox-maze IV procedure (n = 104). The operative mortality for the mitral valve procedure alone was predicted for each group using the Society of Thoracic Surgeons perioperative risk calculator. The risk attributed to the added Cox-maze IV procedure was calculated by comparing the predicted mortality rate of an isolated mitral valve procedure and the actual mortality rate of mitral valve surgery with a concomitant Cox-maze IV procedure.

Results

For patients not undergoing a Cox-maze IV procedure, the predicted and actual postoperative mortality rate was 5.5% and 4.6% (5 of 109), respectively. For patients receiving mitral valve surgery and a concomitant Cox-maze IV, the predicted and actual postoperative mortality of the mitral valve procedure was 2.5% and 2.9% (3 of 104), respectively, and not significantly different. Patients not offered a Cox-maze IV procedure had significantly more serious comorbidities.

Conclusions

For patients with atrial fibrillation and mitral valve disease undergoing mitral valve surgery, the decision to offer a concomitant Cox-maze IV procedure will be influenced by the underlying comorbid conditions. Nonetheless, in selected lower risk patients, the addition of a Cox-maze IV procedure did not significantly affect the procedural mortality.

### Performance of the cox-maze IV procedure is associated with improved long-term survival in patients with atrial fibrillation undergoing cardiac surgery [^68e0de14]. The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is associated with an increased mortality risk. The Cox-maze IV procedure (CM4) performed concomitantly with other cardiac procedures has been shown to be effective for restoring sinus rhythm. However, few data have been published on the late survival of patients undergoing a concomitant CM4.

Methods

Patients undergoing cardiac surgery were retrospectively reviewed from 2001 to 2016 (n = 10,859). Patients were stratified into 3 groups: patients with a history of AF receiving a concomitant CM4 (CM4; n = 438), patients with a history of AF unaddressed during surgery (Untreated AF; n = 1510), and patients without AF history (No AF; n = 8911). Propensity score matching was conducted between the CM4 and Untreated AF groups, and between the CM4 and No AF groups.

Results

Thirty-day mortality was similar between the matched groups. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed greater survival for CM4 compared to Untreated AF (P = 0.004). Ten-year survival was 62% for CM4 and 42% for Untreated AF. Adjusted hazard ratio was 0.47 (95% confidence interval, 0.26–0.86, P = 0.014). No difference in survival was found between CM4 and No AF groups with the Kaplan-Meier analysis (P = 0.847). Ten-year survival was 63% for CM4 and 55% for No AF. Adjusted hazard ratio was 1.03 (95% confidence interval, 0.51–2.11, P = 0.929).

Conclusions

For selected patients with a history of AF undergoing cardiac surgery, concomitant CM4 did not add significantly to postoperative morbidity or mortality and was associated with improved late survival compared with patients with untreated AF and a similar survival to patients without a history of AF.

Nevertheless, the development of these new ablation technologies has benefited the surgical treatment of AF by making a technically difficult and time-consuming surgery easier for all cardiac surgeons to perform. At present, more than 50% of the patients undergoing open-heart surgery who have AF are offered concomitant AF surgery. Replicating the full Cox-Maze lesion set with linear lines of ablation has been shown to be both feasible and clinically effective. A number of groups have reported excellent results with ablation-assisted Cox-Maze procedures.,

The largest of these experiences included 282 patients who underwent the Cox-Maze IV procedure over a 7-year period with either paroxysmal (n = 118), persistent (n = 28), or long-standing persistent AF (n = 135). A total of 124 patients (44%) underwent surgery only for AF treatment, and 158 patients (56%) had other cardiac surgery performed, which included mitral valve surgery in approximately 50% of patients. Among the entire patient cohort, 89% of the patients were in sinus rhythm with or without AAD therapy, and 78% were in sinus rhythm and free of AAD therapy at 12 months of follow-up. In contrast to early studies on surgical AF ablation, more intensive monitoring was performed with Holter monitors every 3 months in 70% of the patients. The incidence of major complications was 11%, including an operative mortality of 2% and a 1.7% incidence of stroke. Pacemakers were implanted in 9% postoperatively. A propensity analysis, matching patients who underwent an ablation-assisted Cox-Maze with those having had a traditional cut-and-sew Cox-Maze III, showed no differences in freedom from AF at 3, 6, and 12 months of follow-up. Further recent work has shown significantly improved results when the entire posterior LA is excluded by the so-called box lesion.

The need for PPI after operation remains a matter of concern for the Cox maze III procedure. In our study, 2 of 3 patients received PPI before discharge converted sinus rhythm at 3 months postoperatively, meanwhile one patient with junctional rhythm at discharge required PPI. The incidence of PPI in two and three associated valve procedures was 15% vs 20% respectively. The results related to the need for PPI in the literatures were different. In a case-matched study, Stulak et al. found that new PPI was required in significantly more patients in the radiofrequency group than in the cut and sew group (25% versus 5%). In a single-center cohort of Cox maze III procedure concomitant cardiac surgery, Fernando A et al. found that the PPI was required in 3.6% of total, and 18.2% of those with three associated valve procedures. A cumulative meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCT) on clinical outcomes of surgical ablation versus no ablative treatment in all patients with cardiac surgery demonstrated that there were no significant differences between surgical ablation versus no ablation in terms of pacemaker implantations. One reason that new permanent pacemakers are required following a maze procedure is premature pacemaker implantation for a temporary junctional rhythm immediately postoperatively. In the present study, the rate of junctional rhythm in the immediate postoperative period following maze procedure was 7.9% (5/64) overall.

The following factors limited this study. First, it was a retrospective trial and possessed all the inherent limitations of this type of study design. Second, the rhythm was evaluated mainly on the basis of 12-lead ECG and partly by 24-h Holter ECG, which might tend to overestimate the clinical success, compared with long-term monitoring. The HRS guidelines (2012) recommend that a 1- to 7-day Holter monitoring is an effective way to identify frequent asymptomatic recurrences of AF. We have begun to follow patients with 7-day Holter monitoring during follow-up in the current era. Finally, our follow-up data were not available for all patients, and had a small sample size. A larger sample and longer follow-up are required for a future study. This is just the beginning of our study and will continue to do better.

Persistence of sinus rhythm (SR)

Low heterogeneity was noted across clinical studies with SR follow-up results. The number of patients in SR at discharge was significantly higher in the MVS + Maze group compared to the MVS group (OR 8.63; 95% CI 3.34–22.28; P < 0.00001; I² = 58%). At the 6 months follow-up, (OR 8.75; 95% CI 4.56–16.81; P < 0.00001; I² = 27.2%). At the 12 months follow-up, (OR 10.29; 95% CI 5.58–18.99; P < 0.00001; I² = 44.8%). The results are summarized in Fig. 6. However, CI (from 3.34 to 22.28 fold higher risk than control) and prediction intervals around the pooled estimates were wide (Fig. 2 B) illustrating uncertainty when comparing discharge SR among patients who underwent MVS + Maze and MVS alone.

Reliability and conclusiveness of composite outcome result

To determine the optimal information size we assumed a 10% control event rate (the control event rate in our meta-analysis for the composite outcome) and a 25% relative risk reduction with 80% power and a 0.01 two-sided. Our calculations indicated that the optimal information size needed to reliably detect a plausible treatment effect, for the composite outcome of t he risk of 1 year all-cause mortality, is 6874 patients. We used the optimal information size to help construct the TSA (trial sequential analysis) (Fig. 7). The sequential boundary has not been crossed, indicating that the cumulative evidence is unreliable and inconclusive.

### Intraoperative modified cox mini-maze procedure for long-standing persistent atrial fibrillation [^81b36f07]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Background

As the most effective method of curing atrial fibrillation, the classic Maze III procedure eliminates atrial fibrillation in more than 90% of patients. In spite of high efficacy, the complexity and complications associated with this procedure prevents widespread application. In this research, we report our experience with a modified Cox mini-Maze procedure using radiofrequency energy for treating long-standing persistent atrial fibrillation during open-heart surgery.

Methods

A total of 45 patients with long-standing persistent atrial fibrillation who underwent open-heart surgery received the treatment. This modified Cox mini-Maze procedure was performed using unipolar and bipolar radiofrequency systems. Some lesions were done with unipolar pen both epicardially and endocardially to improve the transmurality of ablation.

Results

Hospital mortality was 0%. The follow-up time ranged from 6 to 26 months (mean, 16.6). Overall freedom from atrial fibrillation was 86.7% at latest follow-up after surgery. When analyzed by the Kaplan-Meier method, freedom from atrial fibrillation was 94% (6 months), 87% (12 months), and 82% (24 months). Compared with a randomized Cox Maze III control group, the results of freedom from atrial fibrillation do not show significant differences between the two groups at interval contacts. The survival rate was 100% (45 of 45), as was freedom from stroke. No patients required implantation of a permanent pacemaker. Recovery of atrial contractility occurred in 94.6% of patients (35 of 37) during the latest follow-up.

Conclusions

According to our experience, the modified Cox mini-Maze procedure allows rapid ablation application and offers an optimistic outcome for the recovery of sinus rhythm in patients with long-standing persistent atrial fibrillation who undergo open-heart surgery.

### Surgical treatment of atrial fibrillation: predictors of late recurrence [^2adb3025]. The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

The Cox maze procedure was introduced in 1987 for the treatment of atrial fibrillation. This study evaluated the predictors of late atrial fibrillation recurrence in 276 consecutive patients who underwent this procedure at our institution.

Methods

From 1987 through June 2003, 276 patients (79 female and 197 male patients; mean age, 55 ± 11 years) underwent the Cox maze procedure. Thirty-three patients had Cox maze procedure I, 16 patients had Cox maze procedure II, and 197 patients had Cox maze procedure III. The last 30 patients underwent a modified procedure (Cox maze procedure IV) with bipolar radiofrequency ablation. There were 113 (41%) patients who had a concomitant operation, most commonly either a mitral valve procedure (19%) or coronary artery bypass grafting (20%). Data were analyzed by means of univariate analysis, with preoperative and perioperative variables used as covariates. Patient follow-up was conducted by means of questionnaire, physician examination, and electrocardiographic documentation. All patients had a minimum of 6 months of follow-up.

Results

Patient follow-up was achieved in 92.8% of cases, with a mean follow-up time of 5.8 ± 3.6 years. Risk factors for late atrial fibrillation recurrence were duration of preoperative atrial fibrillation (P = 0.01) and Cox maze procedure version (P = 0.001). There was no difference in actuarial 10-year survival between the Cox maze procedure versions.

Conclusion

The Cox maze procedure remains the gold standard for the treatment of atrial fibrillation and has excellent long-term efficacy. The most significant predictor of late recurrence was duration of preoperative atrial fibrillation, suggesting that earlier surgical intervention would further increase efficacy.

### Surgery for permanent atrial fibrillation: impact of patient factors and lesion set [^a02b32fd]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Whether a complete Cox-maze procedure is needed to ablate permanent atrial fibrillation in patients undergoing concomitant cardiac surgery is unknown. Our objective was to assess the effectiveness of different lesion sets in such patients.

Methods

From November 1991 to January 2004, 575 patients underwent surgical treatment of permanent atrial fibrillation (duration > 6 months); mitral valve disease was the primary indication for surgery in 74%. Procedures included pulmonary vein isolation alone (n = 68, 12%), pulmonary vein isolation with left atrial connecting lesions (n = 265, 46%), and Cox-maze (n = 242, 42%). Rhythm documented on 5,120 postoperative electrocardiograms was used to estimate time-related prevalence of, and risk factors for, atrial fibrillation.

Results

Prevalence of postoperative atrial fibrillation peaked at 46% two weeks after operation, declining to 24% at one year. Patient-related risk factors for increased prevalence included older age (p < 0.0001), larger left atrium (p < 0.0001), and longer duration of preoperative atrial fibrillation (p = 0.0008). The Cox-maze procedure and lesion sets resembling it created with alternative energy sources had a similarly low prevalence of late postoperative atrial fibrillation; in contrast, pulmonary vein isolation and lesion sets that did not include a lesion to the mitral anulus were less effective.

Conclusions

This study suggests that in cardiac surgical patients with permanent atrial fibrillation the left atrial lesion set should include wide pulmonary vein isolation, at least one connection between right and left pulmonary veins, and a connection to the mitral anulus. Availability of alternative energy sources to create lesions sets has virtually eliminated the need for the cut-and-sew Cox-maze procedure.

### 2017 HRS / EHRA / ECAS / APHRS / SOLAECE expert consensus statement on catheter and surgical ablation of atrial fibrillation [^1e7c2fc5]. Heart Rhythm (2017). Low credibility.

The advent of minimal access surgical ablation laid the groundwork for hybrid ablation. Seeking to advance the success of the Cox-Maze III yet lessen the morbidity, surgeons began exploring minimal-access approaches. Three things led to the expansion of minimal-access techniques: First was the focus on the PVs as the seminal goal of ablation; second, advances in enabling technology allowed lesion creation using RF energy and cryothermy; and third was the published data revealing modest success for catheter ablation of the persistent forms of AF.

Thus, with the focus on the PV triggers, surgeons began performing an increasing number of minimal-access PVI procedures. However, investigators showed that this treatment was inadequate for patients with persistent and long-standing persistent AF. This led to the belief that the persistent forms of AF needed both substrate modification and trigger isolation, and this provided the impetus to develop the Dallas lesion set, which replicated all the LA lesions of the Cox-Maze III, yet allowed them to be placed on the surface of the full-beating LA. Although it was a major step forward, with a success rate of 79%, this approach failed to reach the success rates of the Cox-Maze III. To enhance the robustness of lesion formation, the complementary processes of performing a catheter-based endocardial ablation in combination with surgical epicardial ablation were contemplated, and this led to hybrid approaches.

### Surgical treatment of atrial fibrillation in elderly patients undergoing high risk cardiac surgery [^25f55a4b]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The Cox-Maze IV has shown excellent success rates with low morbidity and mortality rates and is the only surgical procedure to receive an indication from the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of AF. However the uptake of concomitant AF ablation has not been universal. This study confirmed that surgical ablation was highly effective in the treatment of AF with 80.0% success at long-term follow-up, consistent with previous studies in elderly patients. Macgregor et al. showed the freedom from atrial tachyarrhythmia on or off anti-arrhythmic drugs was 80% and 61% at 1 and 5 year follow-up respectively in elderly cohort aged > 75 years who had had Cox Maze IV. In another study, Ad and Colleagues showed freedom from atrial tachyarrhythmia after Cox-Maze IV in patients > 75 years was 90%, 85% and 60% at 6 months, 1 and 2 years respectively. Our results were also favorable compared to catheter ablation studies in elderly patients. Bunch et al. showed that 46 patients aged > 80 years reported freedom from AF on or off anti-arrhythmic drugs of 75% and under 30% at 1 and 5 year follow-up after catheter ablation.

Importantly, our study clearly demonstrates that surgical ablation did not add perioperative risk even in elderly patients undergoing 2 or more procedures. One of the reasons for the current under-utilisation of surgical ablation is the perception that a concomitant procedure will increase the complexity of the procedure and lead to higher peri-operative risk. Our data refute that argument. Moreover, elderly patients in our study did not experience an increase in renal failure requiring dialysis, reoperation for bleeding, respiratory complications or longer hospital stay. These findings are similar to those previously published by Ad et al. as well as complication rates documented in other studies examining catheter-based ablation of AF in elderly patients. Based on their findings, Ad et al. advocated that age should not be the only discriminatory factor in deciding whether to perform a concurrent Cox Maze procedure.

### Surgical treatment of atrial fibrillation in elderly patients undergoing high risk cardiac surgery [^d3a11235]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

There were 3 patients requiring a PPM post-operatively after Cox Maze procedure (4.3%) which is comparable to the other group in our study. These rates are acceptable as elderly patients experience a greater rate of post-operative PPM compared with younger patients, probably from age-related deterioration in sinus node function.

Our study has shown good long-term survival after concomitant Cox-maze IV. The inherent selection bias prevents comparison between our groups as a whole and the numbers propensity matched are too small to compare over the long term. Nonetheless, the sustained maintenance of SR following ablation may confer survival as well as functional benefits. This is clearly demonstrated in previous studies that have shown patients who have surgery without concomitant AF ablation have poorer short and long-term outcomes than patients that come to surgery and are in SR. In addition, AF was found to be an independent significant predictor of long-term mortality. Ngaage et al. demonstrated that pre-operative AF in patients undergoing cardiac surgery was associated with increased morbidity and decreased survival if not corrected.

There is recent evidence suggesting that anticoagulation can be safely minimized 3–6 months after successful Cox-Maze procedure without increasing the risk of stroke or associated mortality, and this would be another advantage of successful ablation. We are pleased with the finding of excellent symptom relief following the Cox-Maze procedure. The assessment of symptoms and quality of life is challenging, especially when part of the symptomatic benefit can be related to the functional improvement as a result of their main cardiac procedure. However, several studies have shown that the return and maintenance of SR for patients with pre-operative AF conveyed a significant increase in quality of life. Ad et al. also demonstrated improved quality of life through SF-12 and AF-specific questionnaire in the elderly cohort > 75 years who had concomitant Cox-Maze IV. Gu et al. showed patients who were restored to SR post-operatively had significantly better NYHA status compared to those in AF.

Study characteristics

The year of publication ranged from 2002 to 2018. Details of individual studies and patients' baseline characteristics including the history of AF, intraoperative data including antiarrhythmic drugs, and mid‐term postoperative outcomes are summarized in Tabled 1, 2, and 3, Additional file 2: Supplementary Appendix. The AF therapies before surgery are summarized in Additional file 1: Supplementary Appendix. Briefly, 5 (55.6%) studies were implemented in the population in Europe, 2 (22.2%) studies were in South America, 1 (11.1%) was in North America, and 1 (11.1%) in Asia (Table 1). With regard to study design, all 9 studies were RCTs (Level 1 evidence), and similar baseline characteristics were observed in both comparison arms.

Table 3
Summary of perioperative characteristics

Other main features of clinical studies are reported in Tables 2, 3. Of note, demographic characteristics (including age and sex) were available in 218 patients (96%). Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was available in 183 patients (81%) from eight studies and left atrial anteroposterior diameter was available in 156 patients (69%). The mitral stenosis rate and mitral regurgitation rate are demonstrated in Table 2. Permanent AF, persistent AF, and a mixture of permanent and persistent AF populations were evaluated by four studies, three studies, and two studies, respectively.

All patients underwent MVS. Briefly, 61.6% and 38.4% of patients underwent MV replacements with biological or mechanical prostheses and mitral valve repair, respectively. All included studies reported concomitant Cox‐Maze III or IV procedures performed in a standardized or modified fashion. CBP and Cross-clamp time across the studies are demonstrated in Table 3. CBP time was significantly longer when MV surgery was performed concomitantly with Cox-Maze. With the exception of one study which did not report CBP, all other studies reported CBP times that demonstrated significantly longer average CBP for the MV + SA group (weighted mean: 152.1 vs. 122.7 min; P = 0.024). Similarly, Except for one study that did not report cross-clamp time, cross-clamp time was longer for the Cox-Maze + MVS group compared to MVS (weighted mean: 76.4 vs. 63.8 min; P = 0.096).

### Minimally invasive stand-alone cox-maze procedure for patients with nonparoxysmal atrial fibrillation [^3bb0596a]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Catheter-based ablation for atrial fibrillation (AF) performed percutaneously is shown to be limited in patients with nonparoxysmal AF (non-PAF). The full Cox-Maze surgical procedure demonstrated good success with non-PAF, but concerns were raised regarding increased morbidity eliminating the effect of the success rate. This study assessed the safety and efficacy of a stand-alone on-pump Cox-Maze procedure for non-PAF.

Methods

Since 2005, 104 stand-alone Cox-Maze procedures for non-PAF were performed through a right minithoracotomy (6 cm) with femoral cannulation. Patients were monitored prospectively through our AF registry. Rhythm was verified by electrocardiogram and 24-hour Holter monitoring. Health-related quality of life (SF-12 Health Survey, Quality Metric, Lincoln, RI) and AF symptoms were assessed.

Results

Patients were a mean age of 55.9 ± 9.0 years, and 78% had long-standing persistent AF. Patient outcomes included no operative (30 days) deaths or renal failure, 1 pacemaker, and 1 transient ischemic attack. The return to sinus rhythm at 6, 12, 24, 36 months was 94%, 94%, 92%, 92%, and off antiarrhythmic drugs was 87%, 87%, 79%, 80%, respectively. The success rate at 6 months after the initial 20 patients improved from 89% to 94%. Multivariate analysis found duration of AF predicted rhythm at 6 months (odds ratio, 1.15; 95% confidence interval, 1.01 to 1.31; p = 0.04). Significant improvement was noted for health-related quality of life and decreased AF symptoms at 1 year.

Conclusions

The long-term success rate after the Cox-Maze III procedure in a challenging group of non-PAF patients is acceptable. Our experience suggests the development of educational strategies to overcome the initial learning curve and patient selection criteria for AF surgical ablation.

### Establishment and evaluation of a nomogram prediction model for risk of atrial fibrillation recurrence after the cox-maze IV procedure [^d96acdff]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

The Cox-Maze IV (CMIV) procedure is the mainstay in surgical treatment of atrial fibrillation (AF), but the rate of AF recurrence after the CMIV procedure in patients with persistent AF is difficult to accurately evaluate. In this study, we aimed to develop and validate a risk prediction model of AF recurrence within 1 year after undergoing the Cox-Maze IV procedure. We retrospectively enrolled 303 consecutive patients who underwent the Cox-Maze IV procedure for persistent AF concomitant with other cardiac procedures at our institute between 2019 and 2021. A nomogram was developed using multivariate logistic regression analysis, and the concordance statistic (C-statistic) was computed. Differentiation, calibration, clinical suitability, and bootstrapping were performed to verify the model. Among the 303 patients, 71 developed recurrent AF within 1 year of CMIV. Factors predictive of postoperative AF recurrence included age, left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), early atrial tachyarrhythmias (ATAs), and congenital heart disease surgery (namely, ventricular septal defect repair and atrial septal defect repair). Based on the training dataset, the nomogram had a C-statistic of 0.864 (95% CI 0.811–0.918) for predicting AF recurrence. According to the receiver operating characteristic curve, (ROC curve), the cutoff value of the model was 0.293, and the specificity and sensitivity were 0.841 and 0.789, respectively. This model can predict the risk of AF recurrence after the CMIV procedure. Its discrimination, calibration, and clinical applicability are strong, and its clinical application is simple and easy to promote.

### Minimally invasive stand-alone cox maze procedure for persistent and long-standing persistent atrial fibrillation: perioperative safety and 5-year outcomes [^8f0b5fce]. Circulation: Arrhythmia and Electrophysiology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Rhythm control is challenging in patients with extended atrial fibrillation (AF) duration and persistent/long-standing persistent AF. Among surgical approaches to treat AF, the Cox maze procedure performed using alternative energy sources remains superior to other beating heart techniques. We examined permanence of safety and success for the on-pump, minimally invasive, stand-alone Cox maze procedure 5 years after surgery.

Methods and Results

Stand-alone, right 5 cm minithoracotomy, Cox maze III/IV procedure for nonparoxysmal AF was conducted in 133 patients (mean follow-up = 65 ± 34 months). Data collected prospectively at 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24 months and yearly thereafter and reported per Heart Rhythm Society Guidelines. Paired-samples t tests evaluated quality of life changes. Mean age was 57.3 ± 9.2 years, mean LA size was 4.9 ± 1.1 cm, median AF duration was 51 months, and 78% had long-standing persistent AF. All procedures performed with no conversion to midsternotomy, no renal failure, strokes, or operative mortality (< 30 days), transient ischemic attack in 1 patient, reoperation for bleeding in 2 patients, and median length of stay was 4 days [3–5.5 days]. At 5 years, 73% were in sinus rhythm off antiarrhythmic medications after single intervention, 1 stroke (718 patient-years) with 81% off anticoagulation, catheter ablation reinterventions in 13 patients for atrial arrhythmia, and cardioversions in 15 patients. Quality of life scores improved significantly by 12 months after surgery.

Conclusions

Successful ablation for nonparoxysmal AF is challenging. Therefore, periprocedural safety and long-term efficacy of minimally invasive Cox maze procedures should be noted. Continued refinement of decision-making techniques is warranted to improve patient selection for the appropriate intervention to treat AF.

### The long-term safety and efficacy of concomitant cox maze procedures for atrial fibrillation in patients without mitral valve disease [^14ef5a01]. The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

Newly published guidelines made the highest level recommendation for surgical treatment for atrial fibrillation. However, the number of patients without a mitral valve procedure with atrial fibrillation who are treated with concomitant surgical ablation is still low (15%-25%), because surgeons are reluctant to perform procedures in patients who would not otherwise require left atriotomy. The purpose of this study was to compare the outcomes of concomitant Cox maze with and without mitral valve procedures.

Methods

Patients who underwent concomitant Cox maze procedures were prospectively followed since September 2005. Of the 711 patients, 238 did not receive mitral valve surgery. Propensity score matching was conducted to balance preoperative characteristics between patients with and without mitral valve procedures (164/group after matching).

Results

Before matching, patients in the mitral valve group were younger (65 vs 67 years, P = 0.047) and had higher euroSCORE II (European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation; 3.2% vs 2.6%, P = 0.002), larger mean left atrial size (5.3 vs 4.8 cm, P < .001), and shorter median atrial fibrillation duration (19 vs 25 months, P = 0.064). Early outcomes were similar for the matched groups. Cumulative 5-year freedom from stroke did not differ between matched mitral valve and non-mitral valve groups (96.1% vs 96.6%, P = 0.667). At each time point, the proportion in sinus rhythm off antiarrhythmic medications was similar for the matched groups, including 5 years after surgery (68% vs 63%, P = 0.492).

Conclusions

The Cox maze procedure is safe and effective with comparable outcomes when performed concomitant to mitral valve or non-mitral valve surgery. Surgeons should base the decision to perform surgical ablation procedures on atrial fibrillation pathophysiology and the benefit to patients, not on the type of concomitant procedure.

### Predictors and risk of pacemaker implantation after the cox-maze IV procedure [^e9246058]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Background

The incidence of and causes for permanent pacemaker implantation (PPM) after surgical arrhythmia procedures remain poorly understood because of the varied lesion patterns and energy sources reported in small series. This study characterized the incidence, indications, and risk factors for PPM after the Cox-maze IV (CMIV) procedure when performed as either a lone or a concomitant procedure.

Methods

A retrospective analysis of 340 patients undergoing a CMIV as either a lone (n = 112) or a concomitant (n = 228) procedure was conducted. The incidence, indication, and variables associated with PPM implantation within 1 year of the operation were assessed. Follow-up was conducted at 30 days and 1 year and was 90% complete.

Results

The incidence of PPM after a lone CMIV procedure was 5%. Patients with concomitant cardiac operations had a nonsignificant increase in PPM insertion at 30 days (11% vs 5%, p = 0.14) and 1 year (15% vs 6%, p = 0.06) when compared with lone CMIV patients. Of patients who required pacemakers, sinus node dysfunction was present in 79% (35/44) of patients in the entire series and in 88% (8/9) after lone CMIV. After PPM, 84% (37/44) of patients remained paced at last follow-up. Multivariate analysis identified age (odds ratio = 1.10 [1.06–1.14], p < 0.001) as the only variable associated with higher risk of a PPM after any CMIV procedure.

Conclusions

The risk of PPM implantation after a lone CMIV is 5% and increases with age. The need for a PPM after a CMIV is largely due to SA node dysfunction, which appears unlikely to recover. These data should help physicians counsel patients regarding the perioperative risks associated with the CMIV.

### 2012 HRS / EHRA / ECAS expert consensus statement on catheter and surgical ablation of atrial fibrillation: recommendations for patient selection, procedural techniques, patient management and follow-up, definitions, endpoints, and research trial design [^27f7130a]. Europace (2012). Medium credibility.

Surgical ablation of atrial fibrillation — Cox-Maze III development and outcomes are described with midterm follow-up. The Maze procedure was introduced for the surgical treatment of AF in 1987 by Dr. James Cox and was designed to interrupt atrial macroreentrant circuits; the operation also isolated all of the PVs and the posterior LA, and the Cox-Maze III became the standard for the surgical treatment of AF. Long-term outcomes of 198 patients (paroxysmal N = 113; persistent/longstanding persistent N = 85) are reported with a mean follow-up of 5.4 ± 2.9 years. Among 112 patients who underwent surgery only for AF, 96% were in sinus rhythm with or without antiarrhythmic drug therapy and 80% were in sinus rhythm and free of antiarrhythmic drug therapy at last follow-up; major complications occurred in 10.7% with two perioperative deaths, two perioperative strokes or TIAs, and Nine patients (8%) requiring pacemaker placement. Among 86 patients who underwent AF surgery in conjunction with other cardiac surgery, 97.5% were in sinus rhythm with or without antiarrhythmic drug therapy and 73% were in sinus rhythm and free of antiarrhythmic drug therapy; major complications occurred in 13.9% with one perioperative death, one perioperative stroke, and Twenty patients (23%) requiring pacemaker placement. The report notes these patients did not undergo rigorous follow-up by present standards, with rhythms documented largely by mailed questionnaire or telephone interview and very few having monitoring beyond an ECG.

### A prospective, single-center clinical trial of a modified cox maze procedure with bipolar radiofrequency ablation [^5465c837]. The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

The Cox maze III procedure has excellent long-term efficacy in curing atrial fibrillation. It has not been widely practiced because it is technically challenging and requires prolonged cardiopulmonary bypass. The aim of this study was to examine a simplified Cox maze III procedure that uses bipolar radiofrequency energy as an ablative source.

Methods

Beginning January 2002, a total of 40 consecutive patients underwent a modified Cox maze III procedure with bipolar radiofrequency energy. Nineteen had a lone maze procedure and 21 had a maze procedure plus a concomitant operation. One month after the operation, the first 8 patients were investigated with high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging. Patients were followed up monthly with clinical examination and electrocardiography.

Results

There was no operative deaths. The crossclamp times were 47 ± 26 minutes for the modified lone Cox maze III procedure and 92 ± 37 minutes for the Cox maze III procedure plus concomitant procedures. These were significantly shorter than our previous times for the traditional Cox maze III procedure (93 ± 34 minutes and 122 ± 37 minutes, respectively, P < .05). Follow-up magnetic resonance imaging showed no evidence of pulmonary vein stenosis, and atrial contractility was preserved in all patients. There were no late strokes. At 6-month follow-up, 91% of patients (21/23) were in sinus rhythm.

Conclusions

Bipolar radiofrequency ablation can be used to replace the surgical incisions of the Cox maze procedure. This energy source did not result in pulmonary vein stenosis. The modification of the Cox maze III procedure to use bipolar radiofrequency ablation simplified and shortened this procedure without sacrificing short-term efficacy.

### The impact of CHADS₂ score on late stroke after the cox maze procedure [^6723cf26]. The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

The Heart Rhythm Society, European Heart Rhythm Association, and European Cardiac Arrhythmia Society jointly recommend indefinite warfarin anticoagulation in patients with CHADS2 (congestive heart failure, hypertension, age, diabetes, and stroke) score of at least 2 who have undergone ablation for atrial fibrillation. This study determined the impact of CHADS2 score on risk of late stroke or transient ischemic attack after the performance of a surgical Cox maze procedure.

Methods

A retrospective review of 433 patients who underwent a Cox maze procedure at our institution was conducted. Three months after surgery, warfarin was discontinued regardless of CHADS2 score if the patient showed no evidence of atrial fibrillation, was off antiarrhythmic medications, and had no other indication for anticoagulation. A follow-up questionnaire was used to determine whether any neurologic event had occurred since surgery.

Results

Follow-up was obtained for 90% of the study group (389/433) at a mean of 6.6 ± 5.0 years. Among these patients, 32% (125/389) had a CHADS2 score of at least 2, of whom only 40% (51/125) remained on long-term warfarin after surgery. Six patients had late neurologic events (annualized risk of 0.2%). Neither CHADS2 score nor warfarin anticoagulation was significantly associated with the occurrence of late neurologic events. Among the individual CHADS2 criteria, both diabetes mellitus and previous stroke or transient ischemic attack were predictive of late neurologic events.

Conclusions

The risk of stroke or transient ischemic attack in patients after a surgical Cox maze procedure was low and not associated with CHADS2 score or warfarin use. Given the known risks of warfarin, we recommend discontinuation of anticoagulation 3 months after the procedure if the patient has no evidence of atrial fibrillation, has discontinued antiarrhythmic medications, and is without any other indication for systemic anticoagulation.

### Cox-maze IV results for patients with lone atrial fibrillation versus concomitant mitral disease [^ea95a751]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Background

This study compared Cox-Maze IV (CMIV) outcomes for the treatment of atrial fibrillation (AF) in patients with lone AF vs those with AF and mitral valve (MV) disease.

Methods

Since 2002, 200 patients have undergone a CMIV procedure for lone AF (n = 101) or concomitantly with MV operations (n = 99). Preoperative, perioperative, and late outcomes between these groups were compared. Data were collected prospectively and reported at 3, 6, and 12 months.

Results

Lone AF patients had AF of longer duration; patients with AF and MV disease were older, with larger left atria and worse New York Heart Association classification (p < 0.05). Operative mortality (1% vs 4%, p > 0.05, respectively) was similar between both groups. Perioperative atrial tachyarrhythmias were more prevalent in patients with concomitant MV operations (57% vs 41%, p = 0.03); however, freedom from AF and antiarrhythmics was similar for both groups at 12 months (76% and 77%). The only predictor for atrial tachyarrhythmia recurrence or arrhythmic drug dependence was failure to isolate the posterior left atrium (p < 0.01).

Conclusions

Patients with AF and MV disease have distinct comorbidities compared with patients with lone AF. However, the CMIV is safe and effective in both groups and should be considered for patients with AF undergoing MV operations. Patients with MV disease had more atrial tachyarrhythmias at 3 months, but freedom from AF and antiarrhythmics was similar to patients with lone AF at 1 year. The posterior left atrium should be isolated in every patient, because this was the only predictor for failure of the CMIV for either group.

Europace (2012). Medium credibility.

Concomitant surgical atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation during cardiac surgery — lesion set effects and series outcomes are reported as follows: In a randomized study of 105 patients undergoing AF or valve surgery, mean follow-up was 41 ± 17 months and normal sinus rhythm at last follow-up was 76% with two more extensive left atrial lesion sets versus 29% with pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) only. In a study of 101 patients who underwent PVI with a spherical cryoprobe, normal sinus rhythm at last follow-up was seen in 53% and was present without antiarrhythmic drugs in 25 patients. A single-institution series of 575 patients (1991 to 2004) reported that 6% (35 patients) had AF as the only indication for surgery, 75% required mitral valve surgery, and procedures included PVI alone (N = 68, 12%), PVI with left atrial connecting lesions (N = 265, 46%), and Cox-Maze (N = 242, 42%). In a prospective multicenter trial using the Synergy Ablation System with a Cox-Maze IV procedure, at six months 74% were AF free off antiarrhythmic drug therapy with a major pre-specified complication incidence of 9%. For patients with a classic Maze operation, the risk of stroke at 10 years has been less than 1%.

### Commentary: closing the "gaps, " single-stage or two-stage minimally invasive hybrid maze? [^caf593bf]. JTCVS Techniques (2021). Medium credibility.

The article by Zheng and colleaguesis a feasibility study to move the needle further toward the classic CM-III anatomy-based bi-atrial lesions using an MIS beating-heart thoracoscopic SA technique combined with single-stage endocardial CA. In a cohort of 27 patients, freedom from atrial tachyarrhythmia (AT) with or without antiarrhythmic drugs after a single hybrid procedure was 64% and 60% at 12 months, respectively, and the addition of a redo CA increased the freedom from atrial tachyarrhythmia to 77.8% and 74.1% at 12 months, respectively. The left and right atrial size decreased in patients maintaining sinus rhythm. The hybrid concept is not unique, although the bi-atrial surgical technique is an improvement to previously reported primarily left atrial thoracoscopic SA albeit with variable additional lesions interspersed between studies. Their outcomes are acceptable but lack significant improvement to outcomes reported in the literature by numerous other centers. The safety profile is admirable compared with other reports. The authors acknowledge the important limitations of their preliminary experience, including a small sample size with short follow-up preventing over-reaching conclusions of efficacy, challenges in their technique to achieve reliable mitral isthmus lesions, abandoned right atrium endocardial ablation in most patients, and the unreliability of assuring transmural linear lesions with the bipolar unidirectional radiofrequency device. A concomitant single-step hybrid CA procedure is obligatory, given the premise of this study; however, a 2-staged hybrid approach may avoid unnecessary CA procedure in some patients, reliably address pulmonary vein reconnection, and perform staged additional ablation lesions for failed index MIS thoracoscopic SA as noted by Lee and colleagues. The authors' inability to approximate the CM-III ablation lesions and desired outcome is not unique to this study, given the technical challenges associated with an MIS beating-heart thoracoscopic ablation with or without complementary hybrid CA, the currently available alternative ablation technology to assure transmural lesions, the paucity of data on mechanisms of ablation failure to refine procedural techniques, heterogeneous hybrid ablation protocols in reported studies, absence of convincing literature to support single-step versus 2-stage hybrid approach, incomplete understanding of the pathogenesis of AF, and lack of convincing randomized controlled trials. Perhaps, their contribution will rekindle future studies among the surgical community to embrace a bi-atrial ablation protocol also proposed by Cox and colleaguesin their template for the "hybrid Cox-maze-IV" procedure for longstanding persistent AF.

### Treating atrial fibrillation is No maze: a reminder to heart teams for concomitant surgical ablation for atrial fibrillation with cardiac surgery [^774311e3]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most prevalent arrhythmia and is often found during times of other cardiac pathologies that require surgical management including coronary revascularization and valve surgery. Surgical ablation of AF, most frequently performed through the Cox-Maze IV procedure, is highly effective in restoring sinus rhythm. Despite robust society guideline recommendations for concomitant surgical ablation (CSA) for AF, the practice has yet to be widely adopted. In this review, we discuss the current indications for CSA, its efficacy in maintaining freedom from atrial tachyarrhythmias, stroke, and adverse long-term outcomes, the safety profile of SA when performed alongside cardiac surgical cases, and challenges with its implementation across the most common concomitant cardiac operations. In conclusion, we present a reminder to multidisciplinary heart teams to consider CSA when indicated for their patients.
