## Question

Is it safe to use acarbose when the eGFR is 45?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether acarbose is safe to use at an eGFR of 45 mL/min/1.73 m². Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the FDA-labeled renal thresholds for acarbose. Then, I should verify whether dosing changes are recommended by kidney function. Next, I will apply those thresholds to an eGFR of 45. After that, I need to consider general CKD dosing principles and safety monitoring. Finally, I will make sure I'm not conflating acarbose guidance with other antidiabetic agents and then summarize the recommendation, anchoring on FDA labeling and CKD dosing guidance.

> Let me first confirm the labeled renal cutoff. Wait, let me verify the exact threshold in the FDA Structured Product Labeling for acarbose: the SPL states that acarbose should not be used when eGFR is less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m², and conversely, when eGFR is 30 mL/min/1.73 m² or higher, use is acceptable with no dose adjustment required [^111V3DnT] [^113duoit].

> Now, I should apply that to this specific case. An eGFR of 45 mL/min/1.73 m² is clearly above the 30 mL/min/1.73 m² threshold, so acarbose use is considered acceptable without renal dose adjustment; hold on, I should also confirm that drug dosing in CKD is appropriately guided by eGFR for renally cleared agents, which KDIGO endorses for routine drug dosing decisions, strengthening the applicability of these thresholds here [^114jrtsW] [^117BPkL1]. For dosing, I need to check the standard adult regimen: initiate 25 mg orally three times daily with meals and titrate to 50–100 mg three times daily as tolerated, with typical maximum daily doses up to 300 mg per day, and no renal adjustment specified at eGFR 45 mL/min/1.73 m² per the SPL dosing information [^115jq16g] [^113duoit].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about safety without considering tolerability and monitoring. Acarbose commonly causes gastrointestinal adverse effects due to colonic carbohydrate fermentation; I should confirm that rates of flatulence and diarrhea are the main dose-limiting issues and can lead to discontinuation, which aligns with ADA/EASD consensus and trial experience, so slow titration and dietary counseling matter [^112fZoPp]. I need to ensure we remember labeled precautions: use caution for hypoglycemia when combined with other agents and be mindful of rare elevations in serum transaminases; if symptoms suggest hepatic injury, I should double-check liver enzymes, consistent with SPL warnings and uncommon adverse event reports [^112tuQj9] [^111Wc34N].

> But wait, what if we are inadvertently mixing up acarbose renal guidance with other diabetes drugs that do require adjustment around eGFR 45? Let me double-check: the glyburide/metformin combination should not be initiated when eGFR is 30–45 and warrants reassessing continuation — very different from acarbose [^114Gsh44]. Sitagliptin (Januvia) requires dose reduction when eGFR drops below 45, again distinct from acarbose's threshold [^115SPuqd]. Metformin-containing combinations such as Xigduo XR also use 45 mL/min/1.73 m² as a key cut-off due to the metformin component, which should not be conflated with acarbose's labeling, reinforcing that acarbose follows the < 30 mL/min/1.73 m² restriction instead [^115pMkyi].

> In summary, I should confirm the bottom line clearly: at an eGFR of 45 mL/min/1.73 m², acarbose is safe to use and no renal dose adjustment is required; the contraindication applies when eGFR is below 30 mL/min/1.73 m², so continued monitoring of kidney function per CKD best practice is prudent while following standard dosing and tolerability guidance [^113duoit] [^111V3DnT] [^111jMeFn].

Yes, **acarbose is safe** at eGFR 45 mL/min/1.73 m² without dose adjustment [^113duoit] because it is minimally absorbed and not renally cleared. The main concern is **gastrointestinal side effects** (flatulence, diarrhea, abdominal discomfort), which are common but usually mild and self-limited [^112fZoPp]. Initiate at 25 mg TID with meals and titrate slowly to improve tolerability [^115jq16g]. Monitor for rare hepatotoxicity with periodic LFTs [^111Wc34N], and avoid use if the eGFR falls below 30 mL/min/1.73 m² [^111V3DnT].

---

## Pharmacokinetics and renal clearance

Acarbose is minimally absorbed [^112RAdJb] and not renally cleared, so **no dose adjustment** is needed at an eGFR of 45 mL/min/1.73 m² [^113duoit]. This pharmacokinetic profile supports safe use in moderate CKD [^113sHgHn].

---

## Clinical evidence and safety profile

Clinical trials and postmarketing data show acarbose is generally safe in moderate CKD, with **gastrointestinal side effects** (flatulence, diarrhea, abdominal discomfort) as the most common [^112fZoPp]. These are usually mild, transient, and improve with slow titration [^114CpXT3]. Rare hepatotoxicity has been reported, so periodic LFTs are recommended [^111Wc34N].

---

## Recommended dosing and monitoring

- **Initial dose**: 25 mg orally three times daily with the first bite of each meal [^115jq16g].
- **Titration**: Gradually increase to 50–100 mg TID based on tolerance and glycemic response.
- **Monitoring**: Periodic LFTs and clinical assessment for gastrointestinal tolerance [^111Wc34N].

---

## Contraindications and precautions

Acarbose is **contraindicated in severe renal impairment** (eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m²) [^111V3DnT] and in chronic intestinal diseases prone to gas formation or obstruction [^116yL8qc]. Use caution when combining with other hypoglycemic agents due to potential additive effects [^112tuQj9].

---

## Comparison with other antihyperglycemic agents

Compared with other agents, acarbose has a **favorable safety profile in moderate CKD** [^113sHgHn] because it is not renally cleared and carries a low risk of hypoglycemia [^112fZoPp]. In contrast, some agents (e.g. sulfonylureas, insulin) require dose adjustment and careful monitoring in CKD [^116NNYmG].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

Current guidelines support the use of acarbose in moderate CKD (eGFR 30–59 mL/min/1.73 m²) **without dose adjustment** [^113duoit], consistent with its pharmacokinetics and safety profile [^114jrtsW].

---

Acarbose is **safe at eGFR 45 mL/min/1.73 m² without dose adjustment**, with gastrointestinal effects as the main concern [^112fZoPp]; titrate slowly, monitor LFTs periodically, and avoid use if the eGFR falls below 30 mL/min/1.73 m² [^111V3DnT].

### Acarbose improves glycemic control in overweight type 2 diabetic patients insufficiently treated with metformin [^112oxYdd]. Diabetes Care (2003). High credibility.

To investigate the efficacy and safety of acarbose as add-on therapy in overweight type 2 diabetic patients inadequately controlled by metformin, a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group design was adopted. After a 4-week placebo run-in period, subjects were randomized to either acarbose (titrated up to 100 mg twice daily) or placebo. The primary efficacy variable was the change in HbA(1c) from baseline to the end of the 24-week treatment period, while the change in fasting blood glucose was assessed as a secondary efficacy parameter.

The intention-to-treat analysis from baseline to week 24 (81 patients for HbA(1c) and 82 for fasting blood glucose) showed statistically significant differences between acarbose and placebo treatment in HbA(1c) (1.02%; 95% CI 0.543–1.497; P = 0.0001) and fasting blood glucose (1.132 mmol/l; 95% CI 0.056–2.208; P = 0.0395). In all, 18 patients (47%) in the acarbose group were classified as responders with a ≥ 5% reduction in HbA(1c) (relative to baseline) at the endpoint compared to 6 (14%) in the placebo group (P = 0.001). The safety profiles were similar for both treatment groups, except for the higher incidence of gastrointestinal side effects during acarbose therapy.

In conclusion, the addition of acarbose to metformin monotherapy provides an efficacious and safe alternative for glycemic improvement in overweight type 2 diabetic patients inadequately controlled by metformin alone.

### Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors for adults with chronic kidney disease: a clinical practice guideline [^116Y6FA9]. BMJ (2024). High credibility.

What is the impact of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors on survival, and on cardiovascular and kidney outcomes for adults living with chronic kidney disease (CKD)?

Few therapies slow kidney disease progression and improve the long-term prognosis for adults living with CKD. SGLT-2 inhibitors have demonstrated cardiovascular and kidney benefits in adults with CKD, with and without type 2 diabetes. Existing guidance for SGLT-2 inhibitors does not account for the totality of best evidence for adults with CKD and does not provide fully stratified treatment effects and recommendations across all risk groups based on the risk of CKD progression and complications.

The guideline panel considered evidence regarding the benefits and harms of SGLT-2 inhibitor therapy for adults with CKD over a five-year period, along with contextual factors, and provided the following recommendations:

- **For adults at low risk of CKD progression and complications**: We suggest administering SGLT-2 inhibitors (weak recommendation in favor).

- **For adults at moderate risk of CKD progression and complications**: We suggest administering SGLT-2 inhibitors (weak recommendation in favor).

- **For adults at high risk of CKD progression and complications**: We recommend administering SGLT-2 inhibitors (strong recommendation in favor).

- **For adults at very high risk of CKD progression and complications**: We recommend administering SGLT-2 inhibitors (strong recommendation in favor).

Recommendations are applicable to all adults with CKD, irrespective of type.

The effect on eGFR slope from week 6/13 until the end of follow-up was assessed in participants with eGFR < 45, 45 to < 60, 60 to < 90, and ≥ 90 mL/min/1.73 m² at baseline. eGFR indicates estimated glomerular filtration rate, and SE denotes standard error. Data are presented as mean ± SE. Data are reported for week 6 in CANVAS and week 13 in CANVAS-R.

- **Adverse outcomes**: Effects of canagliflozin on safety outcomes were consistent across eGFR subgroups, including serious renal safety outcomes (Figures 4 and 5), except for a borderline significant interaction test observed for hypoglycemia across four eGFR subgroups (P heterogeneity = 0.06), which was maintained when assessed using eGFR as a continuous variable (P heterogeneity = 0.004). Participants were more likely to receive concomitant insulin therapy as kidney function declined. Relative effects on other safety outcomes were broadly consistent when interaction tests were applied across the four eGFR subgroups or undertaken using eGFR as a continuous variable.

Adverse events across the CANVAS Program were reported in participants with eGFR < 45, 45 to < 60, 60 to < 90, and ≥ 90 mL/min/1.73 m² at baseline. eGFR indicates estimated glomerular filtration rate and HR indicates hazard ratio.

- **Absolute risk reduction**: The absolute differences in risk between canagliflozin and placebo across four eGFR subgroups, and among participants with and without CKD, were assessed. Absolute effects were consistent across the four eGFR subgroups, with the exception of a borderline possibly greater absolute reduction in risk of hospitalization for heart failure with declining eGFR.

### Safety and efficacy of antihyperglycaemic agents in diabetic kidney disease [^115Vg9vk]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2019). Low credibility.

Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is a major contributor to mortality and the financial burden of diabetes, accounting for approximately 50% of the cases of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in the developed world. Several studies have demonstrated that achieving blood pressure targets in DKD with agents blocking the renin-angiotensin system confers superior renoprotection compared to other agents. However, the effects of antihyperglycaemic agents on renal outcomes in these patients have not been broadly reported or studied until recent years. This article reviews the available data on the safety, efficacy, impact on renal outcomes, and pathophysiological implications of the most utilized antihyperglycaemic agents in DKD/ESRD.

For those with chronic kidney disease, particularly patients with diabetes mellitus, the UKKA 2023 guidelines recommend considering the initiation of SGLT-2 inhibitors. This is to modify cardiovascular risk and slow the rate of kidney function decline in patients with an eGFR greater than 45–60 mL/min/1.73 m² and a urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio of less than 25 mg/mmol, recognizing that effects on glycemic control will be limited.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of acarbose PO (also known as Precose):

- **Decreased blood glucose**: Use caution in patients taking other hypoglycemic medications.

- **Increased blood glucose**: Use caution in patients exposed to stress, including trauma, fever, infection, or surgery.

- **Increased serum transaminases**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as acarbose has been associated with an increased risk of elevated serum transaminases.

### Safety and efficacy of antihyperglycaemic agents in diabetic kidney disease [^116NNYmG]. Endocrinology, diabetes & metabolism (2019). Low credibility.

Sulfonylureas (SUs) were the first oral agents to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and have been utilized for over 60 years. SUs function by stimulating the β-cells in the pancreas to increase insulin secretion and decrease hepatic insulin clearance, independently of hyperglycemia. SUs are recommended to be used after and in combination with metformin as dual therapy due to their low cost and high effectiveness. Several studies have shown that SUs reduce HbA1C by an average of 1.0% to 2.0% as monotherapy and combination, respectively.

SUs have a higher risk of hypoglycemia compared to other oral antihyperglycaemic drugs and should be carefully dosed in patients with diabetic kidney disease (DKD). As most SUs are eliminated by the kidneys, dose adjustment or drug discontinuation should be considered in advanced DKD stages. Glipizide is the preferred second-generation SU, as no dose adjustment is required in moderate to severe chronic kidney disease (CKD), with no increased risk of hypoglycemia. Another commonly used agent, glyburide, should be avoided in CKD stages 3–5, while glimepiride can be used cautiously in CKD stage 3.

No evidence has been found to attribute renoprotective effects, such as decreasing albuminuria or delaying DKD progression, to SUs. The CAROLINA trial, to be reported in June 2019, will provide evidence on the long-term outcomes of glimepiride vs. linagliptin, focusing on cardiovascular and renal outcomes as primary endpoints.

### Selection and dosing of medications for management of diabetes in patients with advanced kidney disease [^113sHgHn]. Seminars in Dialysis (2010). Low credibility.

Diabetes mellitus is a leading cause of kidney disease worldwide. A large and expanding array of treatments for diabetes is available to improve glycemic control, including newer classes of drugs, such as thiazolidinediones and incretin-based therapies. The presence of impaired kidney function with reduced glomerular filtration rate should influence choices, dosing, and monitoring of hypoglycemic agents, as some agents require a dosing adjustment in patients with kidney disease and some are entirely contraindicated. This article reviews the clinical use of insulin and other antidiabetic therapies, focusing on pharmacokinetic properties and dosing in patients with advanced kidney disease.

### Cardiovascular benefits and safety profile of acarbose therapy in prediabetes and established type 2 diabetes [^113AFdTY]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2007). Low credibility.

Diabetes and many diabetic complications are particularly common in elderly individuals. Acarbose has been safely used in elderly patients. A randomized controlled trial of 192 patients with type 2 diabetes aged ≥ 65 years found that acarbose monotherapy controlled blood-glucose levels, with no cases of hypoglycemia reported and no clinically relevant changes in vital signs during the study. A large post-marketing surveillance study confirmed that acarbose is effective at controlling blood-glucose levels in elderly patients and also found that the incidence of adverse events with acarbose was low and independent of age. Clinical observations also show that elderly patients receiving acarbose report fewer problems with constipation.

Diabetes accounts for 44% of new cases of end-stage renal disease, making it a leading cause of nephropathy. However, there are few data available regarding the use of acarbose in patients with renal disease. Recommendations, therefore, state that acarbose should not be given to patients with severe renal impairment. A number of other therapies are contraindicated in this patient population; for example, the use of metformin in patients with renal impairment is associated with an increased risk of lactic acidosis, which can be fatal.

The long-term safety of acarbose has been demonstrated in placebo-controlled trials and in post-marketing surveillance studies. In the randomized, double-blind UKPDS, patients visited hospital-based clinics at 4-month intervals. Acarbose, in combination with other antidiabetes therapies, maintained a good safety profile.

### Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors: Extending the indication to non-diabetic kidney disease [^111KrRT7]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2020). Low credibility.

The primary cardiovascular and renal outcomes of the SGLT2 inhibitor outcome trials were analyzed according to baseline eGFR subgroups. The primary cardiovascular outcome was defined as 3-point MACEs. Renal outcomes were characterized by a sustained 40% decrease in eGFR, renal replacement therapy, end-stage kidney disease, or renal death. Notably, in the CREDENCE trial, the renal outcome was defined differently: as a doubling of serum creatinine, end-stage kidney disease, or death from renal or cardiovascular causes. The outcome of the 'eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m²' subgroup in the DECLARE trial was used in our analysis and depicted as the 'eGFR 45–60 mL/min/1.73 m²' subgroup, based on the assumption that there were no subjects with a baseline eGFR < 45 mL/min/1.73 m². A detailed description of the methods can be found in the Supplementary data. NNT per 5 years represents the estimated number needed to treat over five years to prevent one event.

Regarding safety, the SGLT2 inhibitors were generally well tolerated in cardiovascular outcome trials for patients with type 2 diabetes. There was no overall increased risk for hyperkalemia or acute kidney injury. However, the risk for mycotic genital infections appeared to be elevated due to the urinary excretion of glucose. In the CREDENCE trial, no surprising or unknown adverse events were detected. The rates of ketoacidosis were higher in the CANA group compared to the placebo group (2.2 versus 0.2 per 1000 patients), although the total event rate was low. Subgroup analyses according to baseline kidney function are not yet available.

### Laxative use in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease transitioning to dialysis [^115RZLLc]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2021). High credibility.

Regarding the use of docusate sodium PO (also known as Colace, Docusate Mini Enema) in patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 0–90 mL/min/1.73 m²:

- **No guidance available**: There is no specific guidance for the use of docusate sodium in this patient population.
- **Safety of docusate**: Docusate is likely safe for use in patients with renal impairment, based on its widespread usage in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease.

### Glucose-lowering drugs in patients with chronic kidney disease: A narrative review on pharmacokinetic properties [^115Vvj8q]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2014). Low credibility.

The achievement of a good glycemic control is one of the cornerstones for preventing and delaying progression of microvascular and macrovascular complications in patients with both diabetes and chronic kidney disease (CKD). As with other drugs, the presence of an impaired renal function may significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of the majority of glucose-lowering agents, thus exposing diabetic CKD patients to a higher risk of side effects, primarily hypoglycemic episodes. Consequently, a reduction in dosing and/or frequency of administration is necessary to maintain a satisfactory efficacy and safety profile. In this review, we aim to summarize the pharmacology of the most widely used glucose-lowering agents. We discuss whether and how it is altered by a reduced renal function and the recommendations that can be made for their use in patients with different degrees of CKD.

### Clinical practice guideline on management of older patients with chronic kidney disease stage 3b or higher (eGFR < 45 mL/min/1.73 m²) [^115oQYYd]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2016). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for chronic kidney disease, more specifically with respect to elderly patients (prognostic scores), the ACP 2016 guidelines recommend using a simple score on a regular basis to assess functional status in older patients with CKD stage 3b-5d. This assessment aims to identify patients who would benefit from a more in-depth geriatric evaluation and rehabilitation.

### Invokana [^113VFXL9]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Renal impairment**: The efficacy and safety of Invokana for glycemic control were evaluated in a trial including adult patients with moderate renal impairment (eGFR 30 to less than 50 mL/min/1.73 m²) [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. These patients exhibited less overall glycemic efficacy, and those treated with 300 mg per day experienced transient increases in serum potassium, which normalized by the end of the trial. Patients with renal impairment using Invokana for glycemic control may also be more likely to experience hypotension and may be at higher risk for acute kidney injury [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

	- Efficacy and safety trials with Invokana did not enroll adult patients with ESKD on dialysis or patients with an eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m² [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

- **Hepatic impairment**: No dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. However, the use of Invokana has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment and is not recommended [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### SPL drug information for acarbose [^113fjgiZ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Regarding the use of acarbose PO (also known as Precose) in pregnant patients for all trimesters, safer alternatives should be considered. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of acarbose during human pregnancy to determine a drug-associated risk of adverse developmental outcomes. Acarbose PO is classified under category B3 in the Australian categorisation system for prescribing medicines in pregnancy. This drug has been taken by only a limited number of pregnant women and women of childbearing age, without an increase in the frequency of malformation or other direct or indirect harmful effects on the human fetus having been observed. Studies in animals have shown evidence of an increased occurrence of fetal damage, the significance of which is considered uncertain in humans.

### Risk of bleeding, thrombosis and death among atrial fibrillation patients treated with oral anticoagulants across estimated glomerular filtration rates [^116cQKTH]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

There are limited data about the clinical benefits and harm of oral anticoagulants (OACs) for stroke prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) and chronic kidney disease using the CKD-EPI (Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration) creatinine equation for glomerular filtration rate (GFR) estimation in nuanced GFR stratification. We conducted a retrospective study in 12 centers in China and included 9,510 patients with AF. We grouped patients into the following estimated GFR (eGFR) categories: ≥ 60 (n = 7,616), 45 to 59 (n = 1,139), 30 to 44 (n = 474), and < 30 (n = 281) ml/min/1.73 m².

Logistic regression was used to compare the risks of major bleeding, minor bleeding, total bleeding, thrombosis, and all-cause deaths in patients with AF with eGFR 45 to 59, 30 to 44, < 30 ml/min/1.73 m², and ≥ 60 ml/min/1.73 m² after taking OACs. Patients with AF treated with OACs with eGFR 45 to 59, 30 to 44, and < 30 ml/min/1.73 m² had a significantly increased risk of all-cause deaths compared with eGFR ≥ 60 ml/min/1.73 m² (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.326, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.049 to 1.665, p = 0.016; aOR 1.634, 95% CI 1.197 to 2.200, p = 0.002; aOR 2.492, 95% CI 1.766 to 3.471, p < 0.001, respectively).

Higher eGFR was associated with a significantly lower risk of all-cause deaths (aOR 0.990, 95% CI 0.986 to 0.994, p < 0.001) and major bleeding (aOR 0.988, 95% CI 0.979 to 0.998, p = 0.018). Direct OACs remarkably reduced the risk of major bleeding in those with eGFR 30 to 44 ml/min/1.73 m² compared with warfarin. In conclusion, in patients with AF treated with OACs, higher eGFR levels were consistently linked with reduced mortality and bleeding risks.

### Comparison of drug dosing recommendations based on measured GFR and kidney function estimating equations [^112W1QVf]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

Kidney disease alters the pharmacokinetic disposition of many medications, requiring dosage adjustment to maintain therapeutic serum concentrations. The Cockcroft-Gault (CG) equation is used for pharmacokinetic studies and drug dosage adjustments, but the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) Study equation is more accurate and more often reported by clinical laboratories than the CG equation.

- **Study design**: Diagnostic test study.

- **Settings & participants**: Pooled data set for 5,504 participants from six research studies and four clinical populations with measured glomerular filtration rate (GFR).

- **Index test**: Estimated kidney function using the MDRD Study and CG equations incorporating actual (CG) or ideal body weight (CG(IBW)) and standardized serum creatinine concentrations.

- **Reference test**: Measured GFR assessed by using iodine-125-iothalamate urinary clearance.

- **Outcome**: Concordance of assigned kidney function categories designated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Guidance for Industry for pharmacokinetic studies and recommended dosages of 15 medications cleared by the kidneys.

- **Results**: Concordance of kidney function estimates with measured GFR for FDA-assigned kidney function categories was 78% for the MDRD Study equation compared with 73% for the CG equation (P < 0.001) and 66% for the CG(IBW) equation (P < 0.001). Concordance between the MDRD Study equation and CG and CG(IBW) equations was 78% and 75%, respectively (P < 0.001). Concordance of kidney function estimates with measured GFR for recommended drug dosages was 88% for MDRD Study equati.

### Januvia [^115SPuqd]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The recommended dose of Januvia is 100 mg once daily and it can be taken with or without food. Dosage adjustment is recommended for patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) less than 45 mL/min/1.73 m².

- **Recommended dosing**: The recommended dose of Januvia is 100 mg once daily and it can be taken with or without food.

- **Recommendations for use in renal impairment**: Assess renal function prior to initiation of Januvia and periodically thereafter. For patients with an eGFR from 45 mL/min/1.73 m² to less than 90 mL/min/1.73 m², no dosage adjustment is necessary. For patients with moderate renal impairment (eGFR from 30 mL/min/1.73 m² to less than 45 mL/min/1.73 m²), the dose of Januvia is 50 mg once daily. For patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m²) or with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis, the dose of Januvia is 25 mg once daily. Januvia may be administered without regard to the timing of dialysis.

### A review of the safety of sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors [^113uMwt3]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Low credibility.

There is a paucity of information about the rates of DKA with SGLT2 inhibitor use in those with reduced kidney function. A meta-analysis of the large SGLT2 inhibitor trials found no association between baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and ketoacidosis risk. The CREDENCE trial, which included participants with eGFR of 30 to < 90 mL/min/1.73 m², did have higher DKA event rates than seen in the cardiovascular outcome trials. However, it also had higher rates of baseline insulin use at 66% of participants, which may reflect that people with CKD and T2DM are more likely to be insulin-dependent and therefore at higher risk of DKA.

There were numerically higher rates of ketoacidosis in the EMPA-KIDNEY trial, which included people with or without T2DM with eGFR 20- < 45 mL/min/1.73 m², or eGFR 45–90 mL/min/1.73 m² with proteinuria (0.2% with empagliflozin vs. < 0.1% with placebo, statistical comparison not provided). Meanwhile, in the DAPA-CKD trial, which included people with eGFR 25–75 mL/min/1.73 m² with proteinuria, there were no recorded events.

To mitigate the risk of DKA, clinicians and patients should be aware of key safety advice as outlined.

### Safety and efficacy of antihyperglycaemic agents in diabetic kidney disease [^115nXMNj]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2019). Low credibility.

Given the multiple concerns about the use of several antihyperglycaemic agents for the treatment of diabetes in patients with established diabetic kidney disease (DKD), we believe a strong effort towards patient and physician education should be implemented. Besides this education, we recommend individualizing each patient's treatment, focusing on the potential long-term benefits of each agent, and prospectively proceeding to adjust the dosage and use depending on the DKD stage to avoid any renal damage or stage progression.

Considering the superiority of certain classes of agents over others in protecting the kidney in the context of DKD, we also suggest a stronger interaction between nephrologists and endocrinologists to ensure the selection of appropriate antihyperglycaemic agents in patients with established DKD at high risk for DKD progression. Nonetheless, positive results on renal outcomes with certain classes of agents warrant further investigation in these areas, as understanding the specific mechanisms driving renoprotection may lead to the discovery of new treatments focusing mainly on patients with established DKD.

### Cardiovascular benefits and safety profile of acarbose therapy in prediabetes and established type 2 diabetes [^116xywzf]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2007). Low credibility.

Dysglycaemic disease is one of the most important health issues facing the world in the 21st century. Patients with type 2 diabetes and individuals with prediabetes are at risk of developing macrovascular and microvascular complications. Long-term management strategies are therefore required that are effective at controlling dysglycaemia, well tolerated, and ideally, offer additional cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk-reduction benefits. The efficacy, safety, and tolerability of the alpha-glucosidase inhibitor acarbose have been well-established in a wide range of patient populations in both clinical and community trials. In addition, acarbose has been shown to reduce cardiovascular complications in type 2 diabetes and prevent hypertension and CVD in individuals with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT). Acarbose has a very good safety profile and, owing to its straightforward, non-systemic mode of action, avoids most adverse events. The most common side effects of acarbose are mild-to-moderate gastrointestinal complaints that subside as treatment continues. They can be minimized through the use of an appropriate stepwise dosing regimen and careful choice of diet. Acarbose is therefore a valuable option for the management of type 2 diabetes and, as the only oral antidiabetes agent approved for the treatment of prediabetes, can help to improve clinical management across the dysglycaemic disease continuum.

### Efficacy and safety of canagliflozin in patients with type 2 diabetes and stage 3 nephropathy [^114jD459]. American Journal of Nephrology (2014). Low credibility.

The study focuses on sodium glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, which are approved for treating patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of ≥ 45 ml/min/1.73 m². It evaluates the efficacy and safety of canagliflozin, an approved SGLT2 inhibitor, in patients with stage 3 chronic kidney disease (CKD; eGFR ≥ 30 to < 60 ml/min/1.73 m²).

This analysis utilized integrated data from four randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 3 studies enrolling patients with T2DM and stage 3 CKD. Results are presented for the overall population, as well as for subgroups with stage 3a CKD (eGFR ≥ 45 and < 60 ml/min/1.73 m²) and stage 3b CKD (eGFR ≥ 30 and < 45 ml/min/1.73 m²).

Among all subjects studied with stage 3 CKD, placebo-subtracted reductions were observed in HbA1c (-0.38% and -0.47%; p < 0.001), body weight (-1.6% and -1.9%; p < 0.001), and systolic blood pressure (-2.8 and -4.4 mm Hg; p < 0.01) with canagliflozin 100 and 300 mg, respectively. These decreases were further examined in the stage 3a and 3b CKD subgroups. Subjects with stage 3a CKD experienced greater decreases in HbA1c (-0.47% [-0.61, -0.32]) and in body weight (-1.8% [-2.3, -1.2]) with canagliflozin 100 mg. Initial declines in eGFR were noted early in the treatment with canagliflozin, trending towards baseline over time. The most common adverse events associated with canagliflozin included genital mycotic infections and events related to reduced intravascular volume, likely due to osmotic diuresis.

### A review of the safety of sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors [^1127ysMN]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). High credibility.

The development of sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors represents a major turning point in the effort to preserve kidney function and prevent cardiovascular events and heart failure hospitalizations in those at high risk. These agents have transcended their original glucose-lowering indication and provide a range of clinical benefits in individuals both with and without diabetes, and at varying levels of kidney function. Despite this, SGLT2 inhibitors remain underutilized by the medical community. A potential barrier to improved uptake may be concern about adverse effects. This review summarizes the wealth of information garnered from clinical trials and real-world data in recent years to examine the safety of SGLT2 inhibitors and provides practical advice to promote safer use of these important therapies.

### Effects of canagliflozin in patients with baseline eGFR < 30 ml/min per 1.73 m: Subgroup analysis of the randomized CREDENCE trial [^111QVbXK]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2020). High credibility.

The Canagliflozin and Renal Events in Diabetes with Established Nephropathy Clinical Evaluation (CREDENCE) trial demonstrated that the sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor canagliflozin reduced the risk of kidney failure and cardiovascular events in participants with type 2 diabetes mellitus and CKD. Little is known about the use of SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio of 300–5000 mg/g, and an eGFR of 30 to < 90 ml/min per 1.73 m² at screening. This post hoc analysis evaluated participants with eGFR < 30 ml/min per 1.73 m² at randomization.

- **Design, setting, participants, & measurements**: Effects of eGFR slope through week 130 were analyzed using a piecewise, linear, mixed-effects model. Efficacy was analyzed in the intention-to-treat population, on the basis of Cox proportional hazard models, and safety was analyzed in the on-treatment population. At randomization (an average of 29 days after screening), 174 of 4401 (4%) participants had an eGFR < 30 ml/min per 1.73 m² (mean [SD] eGFR, 26 [3] ml/min per 1.73 m²).

- **Results**: From weeks 3 to 130, there was a 66% difference in the mean rate of eGFR decline with canagliflozin versus placebo (mean slopes, -1.30 versus -3.83 ml/min per 1.73 m² per year; difference, -2.54 ml/min per 1.73 m² per year; 95% confidence interval, 0.90 to 4.17). Effects of canagliflozin on kidney, cardiovascular, and mortality outcomes were consistent for those with eGFR < 30.

### The treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus in patients with chronic kidney disease: What to expect from new oral hypoglycemic agents [^113wQjkD]. Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome (2017). Low credibility.

Worldwide, an estimated 200 million people have chronic kidney disease (CKD), whose most common causes include hypertension, arteriosclerosis, and diabetes. About 40% of patients with diabetes develop CKD, and intensive blood glucose control through pharmacological intervention can delay CKD progression.

Standard therapies for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus include metformin, sulfonylureas, meglitinides, thiazolidinediones, and insulin. While these drugs play an important role in the management of type 2 diabetes, only the thiazolidinedione pioglitazone can be used across the spectrum of CKD (stages 2–5) without dose adjustment. Newer therapies, particularly dipeptidyl peptidase-IV inhibitors, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists, and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors, are increasingly being used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes; however, a major consideration is whether these newer therapies can also be used safely and effectively across the spectrum of renal impairment.

### Acarbose and metabolic control in patients with type 2 diabetes with newly initiated insulin therapy [^114uSeLc]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2007). High credibility.

This study was designed to investigate the effect of acarbose in patients with type 2 diabetes who had newly initiated insulin treatment after previously being insufficiently controlled with oral antihyperglycaemic agents [haemoglobin A(1c) (HbA(1c)) ≥ 8%].

- **Methods**: In this 20-week double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 163 patients were randomized to receive acarbose up to 100 mg three times a day or a matching placebo. Both groups were newly initiated with insulin, which was adjusted according to blood glucose values. The primary efficacy parameter was the change in HbA(1c) from baseline; changes in daily insulin doses were also assessed.

- **Results**: Mean HbA(1c) was significantly reduced by acarbose compared with placebo (2.31% vs. 1.81%, p = 0.033). Insulin doses were comparable at the end of the study. There was no difference in blood glucose and triglyceride levels between the treatment groups. Postprandial serum insulin levels increased in both treatment arms due to insulin administration but less so under acarbose. In contrast to the placebo group, an increase in body mass index was prevented for acarbose-treated patients.

- **Conclusion**: As adjunct administration to newly initiated insulin therapy, acarbose enhances the optimization of blood glucose control in patients with type 2 diabetes.

### Xigduo XR [^115pMkyi]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Recommended dosage in patients with renal impairment**: The recommended dosage of Xigduo XR in patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) greater than or equal to 45 mL/min/1.73 m² is the same as the recommended dosage in patients with normal renal function. Initiation of Xigduo XR is not recommended in patients with an eGFR between 30 and 45 mL/min/1.73 m². It is crucial to assess the benefit and risk of continuing therapy if eGFR falls persistently below this level. Dapagliflozin is likely to be ineffective in improving glycemic control in patients with eGFR less than 45 mL/min/1.73 m². Metformin HCl initiation is not recommended for patients with eGFR less than 45 mL/min/1.73 m². Xigduo XR is contraindicated in patients with an eGFR below 30 mL/min/1.73 m² and end-stage renal disease due to the metformin HCl component [see Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2), and Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].

- **Discontinuation for iodinated contrast imaging procedures**: Discontinue Xigduo XR at the time of, or prior to, an iodinated contrast imaging procedure in patients with an eGFR less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m², in patients with a history of liver disease, alcoholism, or heart failure; or in patients who will be administered intra-arterial iodinated contrast. Re-evaluate eGFR 48 hours after the imaging procedure and restart Xigduo XR if renal function is stable [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

- **Temporary interruption for surgery**: Withhold Xigduo XR for at least 3 days, if possible, prior to surgery or procedures associated with prolonged fasting.

### Efficacy and safety of canagliflozin in subjects with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease [^115Kq4TA]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2013). Low credibility.

This 52-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 study was conducted at 89 centers across 19 countries. It consisted of an antihyperglycemic agent (AHA) adjustment period (if required), which included a dose titration period of up to 4 weeks and an 8-week dose stable period. Following this was a 2-week, single-blind, placebo run-in period; a 26-week, double-blind, core treatment period; and a 26-week, double-blind, extension period. Data from the extension period is to be reported in a separate publication.

Eligible subjects were men and women aged 25 years or older with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), exhibiting inadequate glycemic control (HbA1c between 7.0% and 10.5%), and stage 3 chronic kidney disease (CKD) with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) between 30 and 50 ml/min/1.73 m². Participants either were not on AHA therapy or maintained a stable AHA regimen — either as monotherapy or combination therapy — with any approved agent such as metformin, sulphonylurea, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor, α-glucosidase inhibitor, GLP-1 analogue, pioglitazone, or insulin for at least 8 weeks (or 12 weeks with pioglitazone) before the week –2 visit. Subjects were required to have generally stable renal function, defined by a decrease of no more than 25% in eGFR from screening to the week –2 visits.

For subjects on AHA regimens inconsistent with local prescribing guidelines (for example, metformin therapy), an AHA adjustment period of up to 12 weeks was required before the placebo run-in period. Subjects were to maintain their stable AHA regimens through the 52-week treatment period, unless they met glycemic rescue criteria as further discussed.

Subjects were excluded if they had repeated fasting plasma glucose (FPG) levels that did not meet the study criteria.

### Effects of acarbose on cardiovascular and diabetes outcomes in patients with coronary heart disease and impaired glucose tolerance (ACE): a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^117QCQRk]. The Lancet Diabetes & Endocrinology (2017). High credibility.

The effect of the α-glucosidase inhibitor acarbose on cardiovascular outcomes in patients with coronary heart disease and impaired glucose tolerance is unknown. We aimed to assess whether acarbose could reduce the frequency of cardiovascular events in Chinese patients with established coronary heart disease and impaired glucose tolerance, and whether the incidence of type 2 diabetes could be reduced.

- **Methods**: The Acarbose Cardiovascular Evaluation (ACE) trial was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 4 trial, with patients recruited from 176 hospital outpatient clinics in China. Chinese patients with coronary heart disease and impaired glucose tolerance were randomly assigned (1:1), in blocks by site, by a centralised computer system to receive oral acarbose (50 mg three times a day) or matched placebo, which was added to standardised cardiovascular secondary prevention therapy. All study staff and patients were masked to treatment group allocation. The primary outcome was a five-point composite of cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, hospital admission for unstable angina, and hospital admission for heart failure, analysed in the intention-to-treat population (all participants randomly assigned to treatment who provided written informed consent). The secondary outcomes were a three-point composite outcome (cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, and non-fatal stroke), death from any cause, cardiovascular death, fatal or non-fatal myocardial infarction, fatal or non-fatal stroke, hospital admission.

### Acarbose treatment and the risk of cardiovascular disease and hypertension in patients with impaired glucose tolerance: the STOP-NIDDM trial [^1132cMzL]. JAMA (2003). Low credibility.

The worldwide explosive increase in type 2 diabetes mellitus and its cardiovascular morbidity is becoming a major health concern.

- **Objective**: To evaluate the effect of decreasing postprandial hyperglycemia with acarbose, an alpha-glucosidase inhibitor, on the risk of cardiovascular disease and hypertension in patients with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT).

- **Design, setting, and participants**: An international, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial, undertaken in hospitals in several countries. Conducted from July 1998 through August 2001, involving a total of 1,429 patients with IGT. Exclusions included 61 patients (4%) due to lack of IGT or absence of postrandomization data, resulting in 1,368 patients eligible for a modified intent-to-treat analysis. Participant demographic included men (49%) and women (51%), with a mean (SD) age of 54.5 (7.9) years and a mean BMI of 30.9 (4.2). Follow-up period was a mean (SD) of 3.3 (1.2) years.
	- **Countries**: Canada, Germany, Austria, Norway, Denmark, Sweden, Finland, Israel, Spain

- **Intervention**: Patients with IGT were randomized to receive:
	- **Placebo group**: 715 patients
	- **Acarbose group**: 100 mg of acarbose 3 times a day for 714 patients

- **Main outcome measures**: The development of major cardiovascular events and conditions, including:
	- **Cardiovascular events**: Coronary heart disease, cardiovascular death, congestive heart failure, cerebrovascular events, peripheral vascular disease
	- **Hypertension**: Blood pressure levels ≥ 140/90 mm Hg

- **Results**: A total of 341 patients (24%) discontinued their participation prematurely, consisting of:
	- **Acarbose-treated group**: 211 patients
	- **Placebo group**: 130 patients
	These patients were followed up for outcome analysis.

### Comparative efficacy of novel antidiabetic drugs on albuminuria outcomes in type 2 diabetes: A systematic review [^115HMeLk]. Diabetes Therapy (2023). Low credibility.

Among 211 records identified from the database search, 75 were shortlisted from title and abstract screening (Supplementary Fig. S1). An additional 25 records not identified from the database search were included for completeness. Hence, a total of 100 records underwent full-text screening, from which 53 were deemed eligible. Twelve of the selected records were further excluded during data extraction. Finally, data were extracted from 41 articles that reported on 26 RCTs.

Of the 26 selected RCTs, 16 had enrolled patients with T2D regardless of baseline renal impairment and/or albuminuria status, while 10 enrolled patients with concomitant CKD. To ensure the homogeneity of the study population reported in this systematic review, only the results in patients with T2D, regardless of baseline CKD status (from 27 articles representing 16 RCTs), were qualitatively synthesized. The risk-of-bias assessment of the included studies is presented in Supplementary Fig. S2.

### Medical management of hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes: A consensus algorithm for the initiation and adjustment of therapy: A consensus statement of the American Diabetes Association and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes [^112fZoPp]. Diabetes Care (2009). High credibility.

α-glucosidase inhibitors reduce the rate of digestion of polysaccharides in the proximal small intestine, primarily lowering postprandial glucose levels without causing hypoglycemia. They are less effective in lowering glycemia than metformin or the sulfonylureas, reducing A1C levels by 0.5–0.8 percentage points. Since carbohydrate is absorbed more distally, malabsorption and weight loss do not occur; however, increased delivery of carbohydrate to the colon commonly results in increased gas production and gastrointestinal symptoms. In clinical trials, 25–45% of participants have discontinued α-glucosidase inhibitor use as a result of this side effect.

One clinical trial examining acarbose as a means of preventing the development of diabetes in high-risk individuals with impaired glucose tolerance showed an unexpected reduction in severe CVD outcomes. This potential benefit of α-glucosidase inhibitors needs to be confirmed.

### Xigduoxr [^1127eTyU]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Initiation of XIGDUO XR is not recommended in patients with an eGFR below 45 mL/min/1.73 m² and is contraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m²) or end-stage renal disease [see Dosage and Administration (2.4), Contraindications (4), and Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.3)].

- **Dapagliflozin**: Dapagliflozin 10 mg was evaluated in 4,304 adult patients with chronic kidney disease (eGFR 25 to 75 mL/min/1.73 m²) in the DAPA-CKD trial and in 1,926 adult patients with an eGFR of 30 to 60 mL/min/1.73 m² in the DAPA-HF trial. The safety profile of dapagliflozin across eGFR subgroups was consistent with the known safety profile [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) and Clinical Studies (14.4 and 14.5)].

Dapagliflozin 10 mg was evaluated in two glycemic control trials that included adult patients with moderate renal impairment (an eGFR of 45 to less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m², and an eGFR of 30 to less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m²) [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. Patients with diabetes and renal impairment using dapagliflozin 10 mg are more likely to experience hypotension and may be at higher risk for acute kidney injury secondary to volume depletion. In the trial of adult patients with an eGFR 30 to less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m², 13 patients receiving dapagliflozin experienced bone fractures compared to none receiving placebo. Use of dapagliflozin 10 mg for glycemic control in patients without established CV disease or CV risk factors is not recommended when eGFR is less than 45 mL/min/1.73 m².

### Drug dosing consideration in patients with acute and chronic kidney disease-a clinical update from Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) [^113Pe2sG]. Kidney International (2011). Low credibility.

Drug dosage adjustment for patients with acute or chronic kidney disease is an accepted standard of practice. The challenge is how to accurately estimate a patient's kidney function in both acute and chronic kidney disease and determine the influence of renal replacement therapies on drug disposition. Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) held a conference to investigate these issues and propose recommendations for practitioners, researchers, and those involved in the drug development and regulatory arenas.

Attendees discussed the major challenges facing drug dosage adjustment for patients with kidney disease. In particular, although the glomerular filtration rate is the metric used to guide dose adjustment, kidney disease affects nonrenal clearances, and this is not adequately considered in most pharmacokinetic studies. There are also inadequate studies in patients receiving all forms of renal replacement therapy and in the pediatric population.

The conference generated 37 recommendations for clinical practice, 32 recommendations for future research directions, and 24 recommendations for regulatory agencies (US Food and Drug Administration and European Medicines Agency) to enhance the quality of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic information available to clinicians. The KDIGO Conference highlighted the gaps and focused on crafting paths to the future that will stimulate research and improve the global outcomes of patients with acute and chronic kidney disease.

### Summary of revisions for the 2009 clinical practice recommendations [^111DXbTp]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

**Prevention and management of diabetes complications**: Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) cut points for the use of thiazide or loop diuretics have been revised. Pharmacologic therapy for patients with diabetes and hypertension should include either an ACE inhibitor or an angiotensin receptor blocker. If one class is not tolerated, the other should be substituted. To achieve blood pressure targets, a thiazide diuretic should be added for those with an estimated GFR ≥ 30 ml/min per 1.73 m², and a loop diuretic for those with an estimated GFR < 30 ml/min per 1.73 m². Patients over 40 years of age or those with additional risk factors (such as a family history of CVD, hypertension, smoking, dyslipidemia, or albuminuria) should also be considered.

### Kidney disease in type 2 diabetes mellitus and benefits of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors: A consensus statement [^114cBcwy]. Diabetes Therapy (2020). Low credibility.

Evidence from phase II/III trials shows early indications that SGLT2 inhibitors provide renal protection. In a phase III trial comparing empagliflozin and glimepiride, preservation of renal function was observed with empagliflozin (25 mg once daily, n = 769) from baseline to week 104, compared with glimepiride (1–4 mg once daily, n = 780) as an add-on to metformin. The adjusted mean difference in eGFR (baseline to week 104) for empagliflozin versus glimepiride was 3.3 mL/min/1.73 m² (95% CI 2.0–4.7, p < 0.0001).

A post-hoc analysis of data pooled from two phase III clinical trials in patients with hypertension and T2DM, who were on stable doses of ACE inhibitors or ARBs and had microalbuminuria or macroalbuminuria at baseline, showed that dapagliflozin was associated with greater 12-week reductions in albuminuria compared with placebo.

A phase III study of empagliflozin as an add-on treatment in people with T2DM and stage 2 and 3 CKD demonstrated that empagliflozin reduces albuminuria. In a phase III study with individuals with T2DM already on metformin, canagliflozin slowed the decline in kidney function compared with glimepiride, independent of glycemic benefits. Additionally, canagliflozin significantly decreased albuminuria; the effects on ACR were consistent irrespective of baseline RAAS blockade.

### Safety and efficacy of antihyperglycaemic agents in diabetic kidney disease [^115jqwfd]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2019). Low credibility.

Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is a major contributor to the mortality and financial burden of diabetes, accounting for approximately 50% of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) cases in the developed world. Several studies have demonstrated that achieving blood pressure targets in DKD with agents blocking the renin-angiotensin system confers superior renoprotection compared to other agents. However, the effects on renal outcomes of antihyperglycaemic agents in these patients have not been broadly reported or studied until recent years. This article reviews the available data on the safety, efficacy, impact on renal outcomes, and pathophysiological implications of the most utilized antihyperglycaemic agents in DKD/ESRD.

### Cardiovascular benefits and safety profile of acarbose therapy in prediabetes and established type 2 diabetes [^114CpXT3]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2007). Low credibility.

In STOP-NIDDM, administration of acarbose was initiated at 50 mg/day and titrated by 50 mg/day every two weeks to a maximum of 100 mg three times daily or the maximum tolerated dose. The same regimen was applied in the UKPDS, and a similar approach was utilized in a Chinese study. In the PROTECT trial, acarbose was titrated from 25 mg three times daily to 50 mg three times daily, and finally to 100 mg three times daily based on efficacy and tolerability. In all these trials, acarbose effectively reduced hyperglycaemia, and in STOP-NIDDM, acarbose significantly increased the reversion of IGT to normal glucose tolerance (P < 0.0001). Furthermore, these trials demonstrated that the full maximum dose (300 mg three times daily) is not required in all patients. The mean daily dose in STOP-NIDDM was 194 mg, compared with 201 mg in the five-year surveillance study. The low prevalence of side effects in the surveillance study may be explained by the physician tailoring the dose of acarbose to the individual patient in a community setting.

### Acarbose for prevention of type 2 diabetes mellitus: The STOP-NIDDM randomised trial [^1162VPBN]. Lancet (2002). Low credibility.

The worldwide increase in type 2 diabetes mellitus is becoming a major health concern. We aimed to assess the effect of acarbose in preventing or delaying the conversion of impaired glucose tolerance to type 2 diabetes.

- **Methods**: In a multicentre, placebo-controlled randomised trial, we randomly allocated patients with impaired glucose tolerance to 100 mg acarbose or placebo three times daily. The primary endpoint was the development of diabetes based on a yearly oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Analyses were by intention to treat.

- **Findings**: We randomly allocated 714 patients with impaired glucose tolerance to acarbose and 715 to placebo. We excluded 61 (4%) patients because they did not have impaired glucose tolerance or had no post-randomisation data. Among the patients, 211 (31%) of 682 in the acarbose group and 130 (19%) of 686 on placebo discontinued treatment early. A total of 221 (32%) patients randomised to acarbose and 285 (42%) randomised to placebo developed diabetes (relative hazard 0.75 [95% CI 0.63–0.90]; p = 0.0015). Furthermore, acarbose significantly increased the reversion of impaired glucose tolerance to normal glucose tolerance (p < 0.0001). At the end of the study, treatment with placebo for 3 months was associated with an increase in the conversion of impaired glucose tolerance to diabetes. The most frequent side effects of acarbose treatment were flatulence and diarrhoea.

- **Interpretation**: Acarbose could be used, either as an alternative or in addition to lifestyle changes, to delay the development of type 2 diabetes in patients with impaired glucose tolerance.

### Safety and efficacy of antihyperglycaemic agents in diabetic kidney disease [^115Hiq43]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2019). Low credibility.

Diabetes mellitus represents one of the major epidemic concerns and hazards to global human health, as its incidence and prevalence have continued to increase over the past decades. The International Diabetic Federation (IDF) recently published that in 2017, there were 425 million people worldwide with diabetes, with a projected rise to 629 million by 2045 [1]. In the United States, it is estimated that 30.3 million people of all ages suffered from diabetes in 2015, representing 9.4% of the US population according to the 2017 National Diabetes Statistics Report [2]. Among the different macrovascular and microvascular complications of diabetes, diabetic nephropathy — or more broadly, diabetic kidney disease (DKD) — is defined by the presence of albuminuria (urinary albumin to creatinine ratio more than 30 mg/g) on two separate occasions three months apart, and/or sustained reduction in eGFR below 60 mL/min/1.73 m², and/or histological evidence of DKD on a kidney biopsy.

DKD is the most common cause of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and represents a strong independent risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients with diabetes [3, 4]. Despite this, early diagnosis and management of DKD have remained inefficient, resulting in a rise of up to 94% in the number of deaths from 1990 to 2012 attributed to DKD, showing that prevention of DKD development and progression remains vastly unsuccessful [5].

### Cardiovascular benefits and safety profile of acarbose therapy in prediabetes and established type 2 diabetes [^112RAdJb]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2007). Low credibility.

Acarbose is poorly absorbed into the bloodstream and has a low systemic availability of less than 2%. As a result, the risk of any toxic reaction is very low, and at the time of writing, no interactions have been reported between acarbose and β-blockers, sulphonylureas, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, or warfarin therapy. Some other antidiabetes agents are contraindicated with other treatments; for example, concomitant use of repaglinide with gemfibrozil — a lipid-lowering agent that acts by inhibiting cytochromes — can cause prolonged hypoglycemia.

Acarbose has been associated with rare cases of hepatotoxicity and increased liver enzyme levels, but these have not been confirmed in major trials. A few cases of fulminant hepatitis with fatal outcomes have been reported, but a causal relationship with acarbose treatment has not been clearly established. A trial of 20 patients with diabetes and either chronic hepatitis or liver cirrhosis found that acarbose significantly decreased the level of HbA 1c, from 7.2% at entry to 6.3% (P < 0.05) after 8 weeks. More recently, a larger trial of 107 cirrhotic patients with diabetes found that over 8 weeks, acarbose reduced postprandial glucose levels by about 50%, with no changes in liver function. By contrast, sulphonylureas, metformin, and some thiazolidinediones are contraindicated in patients with moderate-to-severe liver dysfunction.

### Acarbose reduces the risk for myocardial infarction in type 2 diabetic patients: Meta-analysis of seven long-term studies [^112CcAf7]. European Heart Journal (2004). High credibility.

To assess if treatment with the alpha-glucosidase inhibitor acarbose can reduce cardiovascular events in type 2 diabetic patients, this meta-analysis included seven randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled acarbose studies with a minimum treatment duration of 52 weeks. Type 2 diabetic patients valid for safety were randomized to either acarbose (n = 1248) or placebo (n = 932).

The primary outcome measure was the time to develop a cardiovascular event. Primary analysis was conducted using Cox regression analysis. The effect of acarbose on metabolic parameters was also investigated. Acarbose therapy showed favorable trends towards risk reduction for all selected cardiovascular event categories. The treatment significantly reduced the risk for myocardial infarction (hazard ratio = 0.36 [95% CI 0.16–0.80], P = 0.0120) and any cardiovascular event (0.65 [95% CI 0.48–0.88], P = 0.0061). Glycemic control, triglyceride levels, body weight, and systolic blood pressure also improved significantly during acarbose treatment.

Intervention with acarbose can prevent myocardial infarction and cardiovascular disease in type 2 diabetic patients, while most are already on intensive concomitant cardiovascular medication.

### Efficacy and tolerability of acarbose in Asian patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled with diet and sulfonylureas [^113Mihcc]. Journal of Diabetes and its Complications (2003). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to investigate the efficacy, tolerability, and safety of acarbose in the improvement of glycemic control in Asian patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled by diet and sulfonylureas. A 24-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled multicenter group comparison study was conducted. Patients were randomized to receive acarbose titrated up to 100 mg three times a day (n = 36) or a matching placebo (n = 33). Concomitant sulfonylurea treatment remained unchanged throughout the study.

The primary efficacy parameter was the change in HbA(1c) from baseline to the double-blind endpoint. Secondary efficacy variables consisted of the change from baseline to endpoint in blood glucose (fasting and 1-hour postprandial), serum insulin (fasting and 1-hour postprandial), and urinary glucose. In the intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis, acarbose treatment was associated with significantly greater reductions in glycated hemoglobin (HbA(1c)) (-0.91% vs. placebo 0.13%, P = 0.0018) and 1-hour postprandial blood glucose levels (-2.84 mmol/l vs. placebo -0.28 mmol/l, P = 0.002) compared to placebo.

There were no significant differences between the treatment groups regarding changes in fasting blood glucose, fasting or 1-hour postprandial serum insulin, urinary glucose, or body weight. Adverse events occurred with similar frequency in both treatment arms, except for drug-related gastrointestinal side effects associated with acarbose (acarbose 48.5% and placebo 12.5%). This study has shown that the use of acarbose in Asian patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled by diet and sulfonylureas is effective in reducing certain glycemic parameters.

### Renal, cardiovascular, and safety outcomes of canagliflozin by baseline kidney function: A secondary analysis of the CREDENCE randomized trial [^116Tkz2i]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2020). High credibility.

Canagliflozin reduced renal and cardiovascular events in people with type 2 diabetes in the CREDENCE trial. We assessed the efficacy and safety of canagliflozin by initial estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR).

- **Methods**: CREDENCE randomly assigned 4,401 participants with an eGFR of 30 to < 90 ml/min per 1.73 m². Subgroups with lower eGFRs, who were at greater risk, exhibited larger absolute benefits for renal outcomes. Canagliflozin's lack of effect on serious adverse events, amputations, and fractures appeared consistent among eGFR subgroups. In all subgroups, canagliflozin use led to an acute eGFR drop followed by relative stabilization of eGFR loss. Among those with an eGFR of 30 to < 45 ml/min per 1.73 m², canagliflozin led to an initial drop of 2.03 ml/min per 1.73 m². Thereafter, decline in eGFR was slower in the canagliflozin group versus the placebo group (-1.72 versus -4.33 ml/min per 1.73 m²; between-group difference).

### KDIGO 2020 clinical practice guideline for diabetes management in chronic kidney disease [^113Ktzzb]. Kidney International (2020). High credibility.

In the management of chronic kidney disease, specifically for patients with diabetes mellitus, the KDIGO 2020 guidelines recommend considering the discontinuation or reduction of the dose of an antihyperglycemic drug other than metformin to facilitate the addition of an SGLT-2 inhibitor. This is particularly important when additional glucose-lowering may increase the risk of hypoglycemia, such as in patients treated with insulin or sulfonylureas who are currently meeting glycemic targets.

### Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors for type 2 diabetes mellitus [^111XPpNN]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, such as acarbose or miglitol, have the potential to improve glycemic control in type 2 diabetes mellitus. The true value of these agents, especially in relation to diabetes-related mortality and morbidity, has never been investigated in a systematic literature review and meta-analysis.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of alpha-glucosidase inhibitors in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.

- **Search strategy**: We searched The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Contents, LILACS, databases of ongoing trials, reference lists of reviews on the topic of alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, and we contacted experts and manufacturers for additional trials. The date of the most recent search was December 2003 (Contents) and April 2003 (other databases).

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised controlled trials of at least 12 weeks' duration comparing alpha-glucosidase inhibitor monotherapy in patients with type 2 diabetes with any other intervention and that included at least one of the following outcomes: mortality, morbidity, quality of life, glycemic control, lipids, insulin levels, body weight, adverse events.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two reviewers read all abstracts, assessed quality, and extracted data independently. Discrepancies were resolved by consensus or by the judgment of a third reviewer. A statistician checked all extracted data entered into the database. We attempted to contact all authors for data clarification.

- **Main results**: We included 41 trials (8130 participants); 30 investigated acarbose, seven miglitol, and one trial voglibose.

### Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibition: Towards an indication to treat diabetic kidney disease [^112Hg1PE]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2020). Low credibility.

Despite the increasing evidence of SGLT2i efficacy in DKD, the use of this drug class is still limited to patients with eGFR > 45 mL/min/1.73 m². This restriction may be ascribed to two main reasons:

- **Antidiabetic drug design**: SGLT2i were designed as antidiabetic drugs and their antidiabetic effects depend on the magnitude of glycosuria, which is limited in patients with decreased GFR.
- **Mechanism of action**: Given the mechanism of action, there was no rationale for their use as antidiabetic agents in patients with an eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m², that maintained therapy up to the start of dialysis.

This evidence should be sufficient for the approval of the use of this drug class, or at least of canagliflozin, in patients with eGFR < 45 mL/min/1.73 m².

The overall safety record of SGLT2i in patients with moderate-to-severe DKD has been positive. Adverse events were more frequent in patients receiving higher doses.

### Efficacy of acarbose in different geographical regions of the world: Analysis of a real-life database [^116MtAsv]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors are recommended in some international guidelines as first-line, second-line, and third-line treatment options but are not used worldwide due to perceived greater effectiveness in Asians than Caucasians.

- **Methods**: Data from ten post-marketing non-interventional studies using acarbose, the most widely used alpha-glucosidase inhibitor, from 21 countries, provinces, and country groups were pooled. Effects on glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) were analyzed for four major ethnicity/region groups (European Caucasians and Asians from East, Southeast, and South Asia) to identify differences in response to acarbose.

- **Results**: The safety and efficacy populations included 67,682 and 62,905 patients, respectively. Mean HbA1c in the total population decreased by 1.12 ± 1.31% at the 3-month visit from 8.4% at baseline (p < 0.0001). Reductions in HbA1c, fasting plasma glucose, and post-prandial plasma glucose were greater in patients with higher baseline values. Acarbose was well tolerated, with few episodes of hypoglycemia (0.03%) and gastrointestinal adverse events (2.76%). Data from 30,730 Caucasians from Europe and Asians from three major regions of Asia with non-missing gender/age information and baseline/3-month HbA1c data were analyzed by multivariable analyses of covariance. After adjustment for relevant baseline confounding factors, Southeast and East Asians had slightly better responses to acarbose than South Asians and European Caucasians; however, the differences were small.

- **Conclusions**: Acarbose was effective in both European Caucasians and Asians.

### Efficacy and safety of empagliflozin added to existing antidiabetes treatment in patients with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease: a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^115gRbL1]. The Lancet. Diabetes & Endocrinology (2014). Low credibility.

Diabetes is a leading cause of chronic kidney disease (CKD) worldwide. Achieving optimum glycaemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes is crucial to minimizing the risk of microvascular and macrovascular complications and to slowing the progression of CKD. This study assessed the efficacy and safety of empagliflozin as an add-on treatment in patients with type 2 diabetes and CKD.

- **Methods**: We conducted a phase 3, randomised, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled trial across 127 centres in 15 countries. Patients eligible for inclusion had HbA1c levels ranging from 7% to 10%. Those with stage 2 CKD (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] ≥ 60 to < 90 mL/min per 1.73 m²; n = 290) were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to receive empagliflozin 10 mg, empagliflozin 25 mg, or placebo once daily for 52 weeks. Patients with stage 3 CKD (eGFR ≥ 30 to < 60 mL/min per 1.73 m²; n = 374) were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either empagliflozin 25 mg or placebo for 52 weeks. Randomization utilized a computer-generated random sequence and was stratified by renal impairment, HbA1c levels, and background antidiabetes medication. Treatment assignment was masked from both patients and investigators. The primary endpoint was the change from baseline in HbA1c at week 24, analyzed by ANCOVA in the full analysis set.

- **Findings**: In patients with stage 2 CKD, the adjusted mean treatment differences versus placebo for changes from baseline in HbA1c at week 24 were -0.52% (95% CI -0.72 to -0.32) for those receiving empagliflozin 10 mg and -0.68% (-0.88 to -0.49) for those receiving empagliflozin 25 mg.

### Efficacy and safety of alogliptin versus acarbose in Chinese type 2 diabetes patients with high cardiovascular risk or coronary heart disease treated with aspirin and inadequately controlled with metformin monotherapy or drug-naive: A multicentre, randomized, open-label, prospective study (ACADEMIC) [^114J8FPD]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2022). Low credibility.

The ACADEMIC study (NCT03794336) was a randomized, active-controlled, parallel-group, open-label, multicentre, phase IV trial conducted at 46 centers in China between June 2019 and December 2020. The study adhered to the Declaration of Helsinki, the International Conference for Harmonization Good Clinical Practice guidelines, and local regulations. The institutional review board/ethics committee at each study site approved the protocol and trial documentation prior to the start of the study. All participants provided written informed consent before any study procedures were undertaken.

- **Eligibility**: Adults aged ≥ 18 years were eligible for inclusion if they had type 2 diabetes (T2D), a glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) concentration of 58.0–97.0 mmol/mol, and a fasting plasma glucose (FPG) level ≤ 13.3 mmol/L (240 mg/dL) at screening. Participants were either treatment-naive or had received metformin monotherapy (≥ 1500 mg/d, or titrated to the maximum tolerated dose) for ≥ 12 weeks. The definition of 'treatment-naive' allowed for the inclusion of individuals who had stopped oral antidiabetic (OAD) therapy more than 3 months prior. Additionally, participants had to have either established coronary heart disease (CHD; defined as previous myocardial infarction [MI] or angina [unstable or stable]) or a high cardiovascular risk, which was defined as age > 50 years plus ≥ 1 additional cardiovascular risk factor (i.e. a family history of cardiovascular disease [CVD], hypertension, smoking, dyslipidemia or proteinuria). Thus, all participants in the ACADEMIC study had an indication for low-dose aspirin.
