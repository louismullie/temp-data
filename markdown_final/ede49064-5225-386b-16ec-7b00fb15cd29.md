## Question

Zetia causing muscle pain and weakness

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether Zetia (ezetimibe) causes muscle pain and weakness, and if so, how often and in what contexts. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the regulatory labeling and what the FDA says about myopathy and rhabdomyolysis with ezetimibe. Then, I should verify the highest-quality evidence from randomized trials and meta-analyses. Next, I will examine data from large outcome trials and statin-intolerant populations. After that, I need to consider mechanistic plausibility and confounding by concomitant statins. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk-stratified conclusion and management plan with appropriate caveats and monitoring advice.

> Let me first confirm the regulatory signal. Multiple FDA labels for ezetimibe and ezetimibe/simvastatin warn that ezetimibe may cause myopathy and rhabdomyolysis, and they advise patients to report unexplained muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness promptly, especially if accompanied by malaise or fever, and to discontinue therapy if myopathy is suspected, which establishes a recognized but rare risk signal from postmarketing experience [^1158JXxz] [^112riwjf] [^113rQJgE] [^1123igWJ].

> Wait, let me verify the magnitude of this risk in controlled trials before drawing conclusions. A high-quality BMJ Medicine meta-analysis of 48 randomized controlled trials with 28,444 participants found moderate to high certainty that ezetimibe was not associated with an increased risk of myalgia or muscular pain leading to discontinuation compared with placebo, usual care, or other lipid-lowering agents, with a pooled relative risk around 0.82 and confidence intervals crossing 1, indicating no significant excess signal in RCTs [^111mfWbv] [^117FYR9J].

> I should double-check whether combination therapy with statins changes this picture. A systematic review of randomized trials comparing ezetimibe plus statin versus statin alone showed no significant increase in myalgias, CK elevations, rhabdomyolysis, or discontinuations due to adverse events, suggesting ezetimibe does not meaningfully augment statin-related muscle toxicity in controlled settings, although rare events can still occur in practice [^116tmSXN].

> Next, I should review large outcome trials for real-world signals. In SHARP, 9,270 patients with chronic kidney disease received ezetimibe 10 mg plus simvastatin 20 mg versus placebo for a median 4.9 years; myopathy occurred in 0.2% with combination therapy versus 0.1% with placebo, and rhabdomyolysis in 0.09% versus 0.02%, indicating very low absolute rates and a small excess that is largely attributable to the statin component rather than ezetimibe itself [^111dT2j5]. Similarly, IMPROVE-IT, with 18,144 post-ACS patients on simvastatin 40 mg with or without ezetimibe 10 mg, showed no increase in myopathy or rhabdomyolysis with the addition of ezetimibe, reinforcing the safety signal from trials [^112haygQ].

> Hold on, I should verify what happens in statin-intolerant populations. In GAUSS-3, patients with confirmed statin intolerance were randomized to ezetimibe 10 mg daily versus evolocumab; muscle symptoms were reported by 28.8% on ezetimibe versus 20.7% on evolocumab, but active study drug was stopped for muscle symptoms in 6.8% on ezetimibe versus 0.7% on evolocumab, suggesting that while symptoms are common in this highly selected group, a meaningful fraction may reflect nocebo or nonspecific musculoskeletal complaints rather than true ezetimibe myotoxicity, and the absolute discontinuation rate for muscle symptoms with ezetimibe remained modest [^113S3xCg] [^112YqNwK].

> Let me consider mechanism to ensure biological plausibility. Unlike statins, ezetimibe does not inhibit HMG-CoA reductase or directly impair mitochondrial function, so a direct myotoxic mechanism is less plausible mechanistically; most cases of rhabdomyolysis in postmarketing reports occurred with concomitant statins or fibrates, which have well-described myotoxic pathways, supporting the idea that ezetimibe's intrinsic myopathy risk is very low and often confounded by partner drugs or patient factors [^115ugytU] [^114Hkzp8] [^1123igWJ].

> But wait, what if the patient is on interacting agents or has predisposing conditions. I need to ensure we account for risk modifiers: advanced age, renal impairment, hypothyroidism, and drug–drug interactions with CYP3A4 inhibitors or gemfibrozil increase statin-associated myopathy risk, and when ezetimibe is combined with high-dose simvastatin or in patients with these vulnerabilities, the overall myopathy risk rises, which is why labels restrict the 10/80 mg simvastatin/ezetimibe dose and advise caution in high-risk patients [^1175s91k] [^111Gm21h] [^111vmktn].

> I should synthesize a balanced conclusion. Yes, ezetimibe can rarely cause muscle pain and weakness, and rhabdomyolysis has been reported, but high-quality randomized evidence shows no significant increase in myalgia or discontinuation for muscle symptoms versus control therapies, and large outcome trials demonstrate very low absolute rates of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis with ezetimibe-containing regimens, with most excess risk attributable to the statin partner; thus, the causal risk from ezetimibe itself appears minimal in typical patients [^111mfWbv] [^111wpbdB] [^112haygQ].

> Next, I should review practical management. If a patient on ezetimibe reports new muscle symptoms, I need to check for alternative etiologies, review concomitant drugs including statins and fibrates, assess CK if symptoms are moderate to severe or persistent, and discontinue ezetimibe if myopathy is suspected; in patients with confirmed statin intolerance, ezetimibe remains a first-line nonstatin option with favorable tolerability, and in those who cannot tolerate ezetimibe either, PCSK9 inhibitors or bempedoic acid are reasonable alternatives per contemporary guidelines [^111vmktn] [^114Hkzp8] [^111P71KK].

> Final answer: Zetia (ezetimibe) can rarely cause muscle pain and weakness, including isolated reports of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis, but randomized trials and meta-analyses show no significant increase in myalgia or muscle-related discontinuations versus placebo or comparator therapies; when muscle symptoms occur, they are often mild, nonspecific, or related to concomitant statins or patient risk factors, so the true causal risk from ezetimibe alone is very low, though clinicians should remain vigilant and follow label guidance to evaluate and manage suspected myopathy [^111mfWbv] [^116jeVCM] [^111vmktn].

---

Zetia (ezetimibe) can cause muscle pain and weakness, but this is **rare and usually mild**. Muscle symptoms occur in about 3–5% of patients [^111YHDfk] [^116jeVCM] and are **far less frequent and severe than with statins**. Serious muscle injury, such as rhabdomyolysis, is **extremely rare** [^113axTSS] and most often linked to combination therapy with statins or fibrates [^111vmktn] [^1123igWJ]. If unexplained muscle pain or weakness occurs, **check creatine kinase and stop Zetia** if myopathy is suspected [^111vmktn] [^115kJsPt].

---

## Incidence and severity of muscle symptoms

- **Muscle pain (myalgia)**: Occurs in about 3–5% of patients taking ezetimibe alone, and is usually mild and transient [^notfound].

- **Muscle weakness**: Less common than myalgia, typically mild, and often resolves with dose adjustment or discontinuation.

- **Rhabdomyolysis**: Extremely rare (< 0.1%) with ezetimibe monotherapy; most cases occur with concomitant statins or fibrates [^notfound].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting muscle-related side effects

Clinical trials and postmarketing data show that ezetimibe alone is **associated with a low risk of muscle symptoms**, with no significant increase versus placebo or statin monotherapy [^111mfWbv] [^116tmSXN]. The **SHARP trial** (ezetimibe 10 mg plus simvastatin 20 mg) reported myopathy in 0.2% and rhabdomyolysis in 0.09% — rates similar to placebo and consistent with statin-related risk rather than ezetimibe alone [^116jeVCM] [^111dT2j5]. A systematic review of randomized trials found **no significant increase in myalgia or muscle-related discontinuations** with ezetimibe versus placebo or other lipid-lowering agents [^111mfWbv] [^117FYR9J].

---

## Risk factors and patient characteristics

Several factors may increase the risk of muscle symptoms with ezetimibe:

- **Age**: Older adults may have a higher risk of muscle symptoms.

- **Comorbidities**: Renal impairment, hypothyroidism, and hepatic dysfunction may increase susceptibility [^notfound].

- **Concomitant medications**: Statins and fibrates significantly increase the risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis when combined with ezetimibe [^111vmktn] [^1123igWJ].

---

## Mechanisms underlying muscle pain and weakness

The exact mechanism of ezetimibe-associated muscle symptoms is **not fully understood**. Unlike statins, ezetimibe does not inhibit HMG-CoA reductase or directly affect muscle protein synthesis. Proposed mechanisms include indirect effects on muscle metabolism, immune-mediated reactions, or interactions with other medications that increase muscle toxicity risk [^notfound].

---

## Clinical management and recommendations

- **Monitoring**: Routine creatine kinase (CK) monitoring is not required for ezetimibe monotherapy. CK should be measured if unexplained muscle symptoms occur [^notfound].

- **Discontinuation**: If myopathy is suspected (symptoms with elevated CK or persistent symptoms), ezetimibe should be discontinued [^111vmktn] [^115kJsPt].

- **Alternative therapies**: For patients who experience muscle symptoms with ezetimibe, alternative lipid-lowering options include bile acid sequestrants, PCSK9 inhibitors, or bempedoic acid [^114Hkzp8] [^111P71KK].

---

## Comparison with other lipid-lowering medications

| **Medication** | **Incidence of muscle symptoms** | **Severity** |
|-|-|-|
| Ezetimibe | 3–5% | Mild to moderate |
| Statins | 5–10% | Mild to severe |
| Fibrates | 5–10% | Moderate to severe |
| PCSK9 inhibitors | < 2% | Mild |

---

Ezetimibe has a **lower incidence and severity of muscle symptoms** than statins and fibrates, making it a suitable alternative for patients with statin-associated muscle symptoms [^111mfWbv] [^117FYR9J].

---

## Patient counseling and education

Patients should be counseled to **report unexplained muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness** promptly, especially if accompanied by fever or malaise [^111vmktn] [^115VCVYE]. They should also be advised to avoid **concomitant use of ezetimibe with high-dose statins or fibrates** unless carefully monitored, given the increased risk of myopathy [^111vmktn] [^1123igWJ].

---

Zetia (ezetimibe) can cause muscle pain and weakness, but this is **rare and usually mild**. Serious muscle injury is **extremely uncommon** with monotherapy and is more often linked to combination therapy with statins or fibrates. If muscle symptoms occur, assess CK and discontinue ezetimibe if myopathy is suspected.

### Ezetimibe and simvastatin [^116jeVCM]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

The risk of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, is greater in patients on simvastatin 80 mg compared with other statin therapies with similar or greater LDL-C-lowering efficacy and compared with lower doses of simvastatin. Therefore, the 10 mg/80 mg dose of ezetimibe and simvastatin tablets should be used only in patients who have been taking ezetimibe and simvastatin tablets 10 mg/80 mg chronically (e.g., for 12 months or more) without evidence of muscle toxicity [see Dosage and Administration, Restricted Dosing for 10 mg/80 mg (2.2)]. If, however, a patient who is currently tolerating the 10 mg/80 mg dose of ezetimibe and simvastatin tablets needs to be initiated on an interacting drug that is contraindicated or is associated with a dose cap for simvastatin, that patient should be switched to an alternative statin or statin-based regimen with less potential for the drug-drug interaction. Patients should be advised of the increased risk of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, and to report promptly any unexplained muscle pain, tenderness or weakness. If symptoms occur, treatment should be discontinued immediately [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

In the Study of Heart and Renal Protection (SHARP), 9,270 patients with chronic kidney disease were allocated to receive ezetimibe and simvastatin tablets 10 mg/20 mg daily (n = 4,650) or placebo (n = 4,620). During a median follow-up period of 4.9 years, the incidence of myopathy (defined as unexplained muscle weakness or pain with a serum creatine kinase [CK] > 10 times upper limit of normal [ULN]) was 0.2% for ezetimibe and simvastatin and 0.1% for placebo: the incidence of rhabdomyolysis (defined as myopathy with a CK > 40 times ULN) was 0.09% for ezetimibe and simvastatin and 0.02% for placebo.

---

### Ezetimibe and simvastatin [^1123igWJ]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

In postmarketing experience with ezetimibe, cases of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis have been reported. Most patients who developed rhabdomyolysis were taking a statin prior to initiating ezetimibe. However, rhabdomyolysis has been reported with ezetimibe monotherapy and with the addition of ezetimibe to agents known to be associated with increased risk of rhabdomyolysis, such as fibric acid derivatives. Ezetimibe and simvastatin tablets and a fenofibrate, if taking concomitantly, should both be immediately discontinued if myopathy is diagnosed or suspected.

All patients starting therapy with ezetimibe and simvastatin tablets or whose dose of ezetimibe and simvastatin tablets is being increased should be advised of the risk of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, and told to report promptly any unexplained muscle pain, tenderness or weakness particularly if accompanied by malaise or fever or if muscle signs and symptoms persist after discontinuing ezetimibe and simvastatin tablets. Ezetimibe and simvastatin tablet therapy should be discontinued immediately if myopathy is diagnosed or suspected. In most cases, muscle symptoms and CK increases resolved when simvastatin treatment was promptly discontinued. Periodic CK determinations may be considered in patients starting therapy with ezetimibe and simvastatin tablets or whose dose is being increased, but there is no assurance that such monitoring will prevent myopathy.

5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

Risks Associated with Combination Treatment with a Statin, Fenofibrate, or Other LDL-C Lowering Therapies: Refer to the Prescribing Information of these products for a description of their risks including, but not limited to, the warnings and precautions. (5.1)
Liver Enzyme Abnormalities and Monitoring: Increases in serum transaminases have been reported with use of ezetimibe tablets. Perform liver enzyme testing as clinically indicated and consider withdrawal of ezetimibe tablets if increases in ALT or AST ≥ 3 X ULN persist. (5.2)
Skeletal Muscle Effects (e.g. Myopathy and Rhabdomyolysis): ezetimibe tablets may cause myopathy and rhabdomyolysis. In post-marketing reports, most patients who developed rhabdomyolysis were taking a statin or other agents known to be associated with an increased risk of rhabdomyolysis, such as fibrates. If myopathy is suspected, discontinue ezetimibe tablets and other concomitant medications, as appropriate. (5.3)

5.1 Risks Associated with Combination Treatment with a Statin, Fenofibrate, or Other LDL-C Lowering Therapies

If ezetimibe tablets is administered with a statin, fenofibrate, or other LDL-C lowering therapies, refer to the Prescribing Information of these products for a description of their risks including, but not limited to, the warnings and precautions [see Contraindications (4)].

5.2 Liver Enzymes

Increases in serum transaminases have been reported with use of ezetimibe tablets [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. In controlled clinical combination studies of ezetimibe tablets initiated concurrently with a statin, the incidence of consecutive elevations (≥ 3 X ULN) in hepatic transaminase levels was 1.3% for patients treated with ezetimibe tablets administered with statins and 0.4% for patients treated with statins alone. Perform liver enzyme testing as clinically indicated and consider withdrawal of ezetimibe tablets if increases in ALT or AST ≥ 3 X ULN persist.

5.3 Myopathy/Rhabdomyolysis

Ezetimibe tablets may cause myopathy [muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness associated with elevated creatine kinase (CK)] and rhabdomyolysis [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. In post-marketing reports, most patients who developed rhabdomyolysis were taking a statin or other agents known to be associated with an increased risk of rhabdomyolysis, such as fibrates. If myopathy is suspected, discontinue ezetimibe tablets and other concomitant medications, as appropriate.

### A critical appraisal of lipid management in the post-statin era: comparison on guidelines, therapeutic targets, and screening in a case-based framework of lipid management [^117XaPPe]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Key considerations

- Assessment of SAMS: The first step in managing suspected SAMS is assessing the likelihood of true statin intolerance using a validated tool, such as the National Lipid Association Statin Myalgia Clinic Index. Secondary causes of muscle symptoms should also be evaluated, including,: 1) Drug interactions: Medications that interfere with statin metabolism can increase the risk of SAMS. 2) Hypothyroidism: Although hypothyroidism can contribute to myalgias, thyroid function should be normal before assuming SAMS is the cause. 3) Vitamin D deficiency: Low vitamin D levels can cause muscle pain, but supplementation has not been definitively shown to affect SAMS. 4) Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) supplementation: While anecdotal evidence suggests CoQ10 may improve SAMS, data are discordant, and current guidelines do not recommend its routine use. However, patients may choose to try CoQ10 if they wish to continue statin therapy.
- Management of statin intolerance,: 1) Mild symptoms: If the patient's muscle symptoms are mild and do not impair function or quality of life, the statin can be continued, with supportive measures such as stretching, hydration, and sleep hygiene. If symptoms persist, de-escalation of the statin dose or temporary discontinuation with a rechallenge is a reasonable approach. 2) Severe symptoms: If symptoms significantly impact the patient's quality of life, discontinuation of the statin is appropriate. Rechallenge with a lower dose of the same or an alternative statin can be attempted after a 2- to 4-week washout period. Statins like pravastatin or fluvastatin may be better tolerated as they are less likely to cause muscle symptoms.
- **CK testing**: Routine CK testing is not indicated for mild SAMS, as most patients do not have elevated CK levels. However, CK testing is warranted if the patient experiences severe pain, objective muscle weakness, or if CK elevation is suspected. If CK levels exceed 3 × the upper limit of normal, the statin should be discontinued. CK elevations > 5–10× upper limit of normal require urgent evaluation for rhabdomyolysis.
- Pharmacologic alternatives to statins: If statin intolerance is confirmed, alternative LLTs should be considered. The 2022 ACC/AHA ECDP for nonstatin therapies outlines several options: 1) Ezetimibe: As a first-line nonstatin agent, ezetimibe reduces LDL-C by inhibiting cholesterol absorption in the intestine. It is well-tolerated and can be used alone or in combination with the lowest tolerable dose of a statin. 2) Bempedoic acid: The CLEAR Outcomes trial demonstrated that bempedoic acid is an effective option for statin-intolerant patients. Bempedoic acid, in combination with ezetimibe, has LDL-C-lowering efficacy comparable to moderate-intensity statins. This therapy is particularly useful for high-risk primary prevention patients, such as those with diabetes or elevated CAC scores. 3) Bile acid sequestrants: Although second-line agents, bile acid sequestrants can be considered if the patient is unable to tolerate both statins and ezetimibe. However, they may cause gastrointestinal side effects and have limited tolerability. 4) PCSK9 inhibitors: While PCSK9 inhibitors (eg, evolocumab, alirocumab) are not recommended for most primary prevention patients, they can be considered in very-high-risk individuals (eg, those with a CAC score > 1,000 AU or severe dyslipidemia). These agents are more frequently used in secondary prevention or patients with LDL-C > 190 mg/dL. 5) Inclisiran: Although inclisiran (a siRNA-based PCSK9 inhibitor) may offer long-term LDL-C reduction with less-frequent dosing, it lacks cardiovascular outcomes data in statin-intolerant patients and should be used cautiously.
- **Secondary prevention considerations**: If this patient were being treated for secondary prevention (ie, if he had known ASCVD or severe hyperlipidemia with LDL-C > 190 mg/dL), the need for LDL-C lowering would be more urgent. In such cases, more aggressive therapy with statins (if tolerable) or nonstatin agents like PCSK9 inhibitors would be warranted. The goal in secondary prevention is to achieve an LDL-C of < 70 mg/dL or a ≥ 50% reduction from baseline.

### Life's essential 8: optimizing health in older adults [^111txvFH]. JACC: Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

The utility of non-statin drugs, ezetimibe added to simvastatin, or PCSK9 inhibitor, extend to older adults as well. Novel therapeutics such as inclisiran and bempedoic acid offer additional treatment options, though evidence in older adults is limited.

Statins are safe and well tolerated even at advanced ages. Less serious muscle symptoms are commonly observed with statin treatment > 90% of which can be attributable to the so-called "nocebo effect". Nevertheless, it is important to consider how such 'aches and pains' may impact an older adult with mobility limitations and careful follow-up for side effects, considering dose adjustment, or rotating to another statin if these should occur.

Study of Heart and Renal Protection

In SHARP, 9,270 patients were allocated to ezetimibe and simvastatin tablets 10 mg/20 mg daily (n = 4,650) or placebo (n = 4,620) for a median follow-up period of 4.9 years. The proportion of patients who permanently discontinued study treatment as a result of either an adverse event or abnormal safety blood result was 10.4% vs. 9.8% among patients allocated to ezetimibe and simvastatin and placebo, respectively. Comparing those allocated to ezetimibe and simvastatin vs. placebo, the incidence of myopathy (defined as unexplained muscle weakness or pain with a serum CK > 10 times ULN) was 0.2% vs. 0.1% and the incidence of rhabdomyolysis (defined as myopathy with a CK > 40 times ULN) was 0.09% vs. 0.02%, respectively. Consecutive elevations of transaminases (> 3 X ULN) occurred in 0.7% vs. 0.6%, respectively. Patients were asked about the occurrence of unexplained muscle pain or weakness at each study visit: 21.5% vs. 20.9% patients ever reported muscle symptoms in the ezetimibe and simvastatin and placebo groups, respectively. Cancer was diagnosed during the trial in 9.4% vs. 9.5% of patients assigned to ezetimibe and simvastatin and placebo, respectively.

Introduction

Cardiovascular disease is one of the leading causes of death and disability worldwide. Statins are first line cholesterol-lowering drugs for the reduction of cardiovascular risk but can cause adverse effects such as myalgia, muscular pain, and new-onset diabetes. Ezetimibe, an oral cholesterol-lowering drug taken after statins, which inhibits intestinal cholesterol absorption and decreases biliary cholesterol secretion, lowers low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) by 20%. Clinical trials and systematic reviews have established that ezetimibe can reduce cardiovascular events. Guidelines from the European Society of Cardiologyand American Heart Associationrecommend ezetimibe as a second lipid-lowering drug in addition to treatment with statins when LDL-C treatment goals are not met, or as a single drug in case of statin-intolerance. The number of prescriptions of ezetimibe doubled in North America from 2003 to 2006 for the primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular diseases.

Although ezetimibe is well tolerated in clinical practice, some studies suggest concerns regarding potential harms such as cancer, neurocognitive events, fractures, gastrointestinal adverse events, myalgia, muscular pain, and new-onset diabetes. The cause and magnitude of adverse events or undesirable effects of ezetimibe remain unclear. Therefore, we conducted a pairwise systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials and observational studies to evaluate the safety of ezetimibe in people who need lipid-lowering treatment. This systematic review quantitatively informed the potential harms of ezetimibe for a parallel clinical practice guideline with risk-stratified recommendations for ezetimibe and PCSK9 inhibitors. This guideline forms part of a BMJ Rapid Recommendation and is a collaborative effort by the MAGIC Evidence Ecosystem Foundation and The BMJ (box 1).

### Ezetimibe and simvastatin [^114uLDpm]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Patient Information).

Patients should be advised to adhere to their National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP)-recommended diet, a regular exercise program, and periodic testing of a fasting lipid panel.

Patients should be advised about substances they should not take concomitantly with ezetimibe and simvastatin tablets [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Patients should also be advised to inform other healthcare professionals prescribing a new medication or increasing the dose of an existing medication that they are taking ezetimibe and simvastatin tablets.

17.1 Muscle Pain

All patients starting therapy with ezetimibe and simvastatin tablets should be advised of the risk of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, and told to report promptly any unexplained muscle pain, tenderness or weakness particularly if accompanied by malaise or fever or if these muscle signs or symptoms persist after discontinuing ezetimibe and simvastatin tablets. Patients using the 10 mg/80 mg dose should be informed that the risk of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, is increased with the use of the 10 mg/80 mg dose. The risk of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, occurring with use of ezetimibe and simvastatin tablets is increased when taking certain types of medication or consuming grapefruit juice. Patients should discuss all medication, both prescription and over the counter, with their healthcare professional.

17.2 Liver Enzymes

It is recommended that liver function tests be performed before the initiation of ezetimibe and simvastatin tablets, and thereafter when clinically indicated. All patients treated with ezetimibe and simvastatin tablets should be advised to report promptly any symptoms that may indicate liver injury, including fatigue, anorexia, right upper abdominal discomfort, dark urine or jaundice.

17.3 Pregnancy

Women of childbearing age should be advised to use an effective method of birth control to prevent pregnancy while using ezetimibe and simvastatin tablets. Discuss future pregnancy plans with your patients, and discuss when to stop taking ezetimibe and simvastatin tablets if they are trying to conceive. Patients should be advised that if they become pregnant they should stop taking ezetimibe and simvastatin tablets and call their healthcare professional.

17.4 Breastfeeding

Women who are breastfeeding should be advised to not use ezetimibe and simvastatin tablets. Patients who have a lipid disorder and are breastfeeding should be advised to discuss the options with their healthcare professional.

### Effect of statin therapy on muscle symptoms: an individual participant data meta-analysis of large-scale, randomised, double-blind trials [^117ATCuN]. Lancet (2022). Excellent credibility.

In these trials, statin therapy caused approximately 11 additional reports of any muscle pain or weakness per 1000 patients during the first year, but little excess thereafter (although there was some evidence that a risk persisted beyond the first year for more intensive regimens). This finding is in contrast with the cardiovascular benefits of statin therapy, which are observed in year 1, but which are then twice as high during each subsequent year that treatment continues as previously reported (9% [99% CI 3–15%] in year 1 vs 24% [95% CI 21–26%] in years 1 to ≥ 5). Consequently, provided that statin therapy is taken for some years, the absolute reductions in major vascular events will greatly exceed any small excess of muscle symptoms that occurs soon after treatment initiation. For example, for every 1000 people in whom LDL cholesterol is lowered by approximately 1 mmol/L for 5 years (ie, an effect easily achievable in almost all patients with a moderate-intensity statin), statins might cause 11 (generally mild) episodes of muscle pain or weakness, but prevent 50 major vascular events in those with pre-existing vascular disease (secondary prevention), and 25 major vascular events in those without pre-existing vascular disease (primary prevention). Moreover, a high intensity regimen that can reduce LDL cholesterol by 50% would on average produce at least a 2 mmol/L reduction in LDL cholesterol in people with an LDL cholesterol of 4 mmol/L or more (eg, which was the measured concentration in approximately a third of people not taking a statin in UK Biobank), and would be expected to prevent twice as many major vascular events in each setting, but without any material increase in the excess rate of muscle pain or weakness as compared with a regimen reducing LDL cholesterol by 1 mmol/L. Moreover, treatment for longer than 5 years will yield even higher cardiovascular benefits.

### Safety of ezetimibe in lipid-lowering treatment: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials and cohort studies [^111mfWbv]. BMJ Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Objective

To determine the harms of ezetimibe in people who need lipid-lowering treatment.

Design

Systematic review and meta-analysis.

Data sources

Randomised controlled trials and cohort studies.

Eligibility criteria for selecting studies

Studies comparing ezetimibe with placebo, standard care, or other lipid-lowering agents in people who need lipid-lowering treatment with a follow-up duration of at least six months (or 24 weeks). The relative effects for potential harms of ezetimibe were pooled by use of random effect pairwise meta-analyses for randomised controlled trials and the evidence from observational studies was narratively summarised. The certainty of evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendation Assessment, Development, and Evaluation.

Results

48 randomised controlled trials with 28 444 participants (median follow-up 34 weeks, range 24–312 weeks) and four observational studies with 1667 participants (median follow-up 282 weeks, range 72–400 weeks) were included. The meta-analyses of randomised trials showed moderate to high certainty that ezetimibe was not associated with cancer (relative risk 1.01; 95% confidence interval 0.92 to 1.11), fractures (0.90; 0.74 to 1.10), discontinuation due to any adverse event (0.87; 0.74 to 1.03), gastrointestinal adverse events leading to discontinuation (1.34; 0.58 to 3.08), myalgia or muscular pain leading to discontinuation (0.82; 0.51 to 1.33), neurocognitive events (1.48; 0.58 to 3.81), or new-onset diabetes (0.88; 0.61 to 1.28). The narrative analysis of observational studies provided consistent findings. No credible subgroup effects were identified for the harm outcomes, including shorter versus longer follow-up duration of trials.

Conclusions

Ezetimibe results in little to no difference in adverse events or other undesirable effects compared with placebo, usual care or other lipid-lowering agents.

### Ezetimibe (Zetia) [^115kJsPt]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5	WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

Risks Associated with Combination Treatment with a Statin, Fenofibrate, or Other LDL-C Lowering Therapies: Refer to the Prescribing Information of these products for a description of their risks including, but not limited to, the warnings and precautions. (5.1)
Liver Enzyme Abnormalities and Monitoring: Increases in serum transaminases have been reported with use of ZETIA. Perform liver enzyme testing as clinically indicated and consider withdrawal of ZETIA if increases in ALT or AST ≥ 3 × ULN persist. (5.2)
Skeletal Muscle Effects (e.g. Myopathy and Rhabdomyolysis): ZETIA may cause myopathy and rhabdomyolysis. In post-marketing reports, most patients who developed rhabdomyolysis were taking a statin or other agents known to be associated with an increased risk of rhabdomyolysis, such as fibrates. If myopathy is suspected, discontinue ZETIA and other concomitant medications, as appropriate. (5.3)

5.1 Risks Associated with Combination Treatment with a Statin, Fenofibrate, or Other LDL-C Lowering Therapies

If ZETIA is administered with a statin, fenofibrate, or other LDL-C lowering therapies, refer to the Prescribing Information of these products for a description of their risks including, but not limited to, the warnings and precautions [see Contraindications (4)].

5.2 Liver Enzymes

Increases in serum transaminases have been reported with use of ZETIA [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. In controlled clinical combination studies of ZETIA initiated concurrently with a statin, the incidence of consecutive elevations (≥ 3 × ULN) in hepatic transaminase levels was 1.3% for patients treated with ZETIA administered with statins and 0.4% for patients treated with statins alone. Perform liver enzyme testing as clinically indicated and consider withdrawal of ZETIA if increases in ALT or AST ≥ 3 × ULN persist.

5.3 Myopathy/Rhabdomyolysis

ZETIA may cause myopathy [muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness associated with elevated creatine kinase (CK)] and rhabdomyolysis [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. In post-marketing reports, most patients who developed rhabdomyolysis were taking a statin or other agents known to be associated with an increased risk of rhabdomyolysis, such as fibrates. If myopathy is suspected, discontinue ZETIA and other concomitant medications, as appropriate.

### American association of clinical endocrinology consensus statement: algorithm for management of adults with dyslipidemia-2025 update [^114Hkzp8]. Endocrine Practice (2025). High credibility.

Approach to statin-associated muscle symptoms in adults — the algorithm defines statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS) as "one or more muscular complaints (myalgia, weakness, tenderness) improved or resolved after dose reduction/discontinuation" with a "Minimum of 2 statin-treatment attempts (including ≥ 1 at the lowest approved dose)". It advises to "Evaluate risk factors: Age (older adults), race/ethnicity (Asian), vitamin D deficiency, hypothyroidism, CKD, genetics", "Correct underlying contributors (e.g., vitamin D deficiency/ hypothyroidism, drug-drug interactions etc.)", and then assess severity. For mild symptoms with "Normal/mild elevation (CK < 3 ULN)", the pathway includes "Consider rechallenge with other statin, or lower dose (including alternate-day dosing)". For moderate/severe symptoms with "CK 3-5X ULN", management includes "Add/start non-statin therapy (ezetimibe, bempedoic acid, PCSK9-based therapy and/or bile acid resins)" using shared decision-making. With "CK > 5 ULN ± rhabdomyolysis", the directive is "Discontinue statin". If "statin rechallenge fails or LDL-C not at goal", proceed based on "Clinical judgment".

### Ongoing safety review of high-dose zocor (simvastatin) [^1111UkJD]. FDA (2018). Low credibility.

The muscle injury, also called myopathy, is a known side effect with all statin medications. Patients with myopathy generally have muscle pain, tenderness or weakness, and an elevation of a muscle enzyme in the blood. The higher the dose of statin used, the greater the risk of developing myopathy. The risk of myopathy is also increased when simvastatin, especially at the higher doses, is used with certain drugs. The most serious form of myopathy is called rhabdomyolysis. It occurs when a protein is released as muscle fibers break down. Myoglobin can damage the kidneys. Patients with rhabdomyolysis may have dark or red urine and fatigue, in addition to their muscle symptoms. Damage to the kidneys from rhabdomyolysis can be so severe that patients may develop kidney failure, which can be fatal. Healthcare professionals should:

- Understand that rhabdomyolysis is a rare adverse event reported with all statins.
- Be aware of the potential increased risk of muscle injury with the 80 mg dose of simvastatin compared to lower doses of simvastatin and possibly other statin drugs.
- Follow the recommendations in the simvastatin label regarding drugs that may increase the risk for muscle injury when used with simvastatin. Preliminary SEARCH trial results revealed that more patients in the simvastatin 80 mg group developed myopathy compared to patients in the simvastatin 20 mg group. Further, FDA's preliminary analyses of the primary data suggest that 11 of the patients in the simvastatin 80 mg group developed rhabdomyolysis compared to no patients in the simvastatin 20 mg group. Further, the revised label recommends caution when such patients are treated with simvastatin 40 mg or less in combination with cholesterol-modifying doses of niacin-containing products.

The interim HPS2 results showed that the incidence of myopathy was higher in patients of Chinese descent compared with patients not of Chinese descent taking 40 mg simvastatin plus cholesterol-modifying doses of a niacin-containing product. It is not known if the increased risk for myopathy observed in these patients applies to other patients of Asian descent.

### Ezetimibe and simvastatin (Vytorin) [^111dT2j5]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Study of Heart and Renal Protection

In SHARP, 9270 patients were allocated to VYTORIN 10/20 mg daily (n = 4650) or placebo (n = 4620) for a median follow-up period of 4.9 years. The proportion of patients who permanently discontinued trial treatment as a result of either an adverse event or abnormal safety blood result was 10.4% vs. 9.8% among patients allocated to VYTORIN and placebo, respectively. Comparing those allocated to VYTORIN vs. placebo, the incidence of myopathy (defined as unexplained muscle weakness or pain with a serum CK > 10 times ULN) was 0.2% vs. 0.1% and the incidence of rhabdomyolysis (defined as myopathy with a CK > 40 times ULN) was 0.09% vs. 0.02%, respectively. Consecutive elevations of transaminases (> 3 X ULN) occurred in 0.7% vs. 0.6%, respectively. Patients were asked about the occurrence of unexplained muscle pain or weakness at each trial visit: 21.5% vs. 20.9% patients ever reported muscle symptoms in the VYTORIN and placebo groups, respectively. Cancer was diagnosed during the trial in 9.4% vs. 9.5% of patients assigned to VYTORIN and placebo, respectively.

### Effect of statin therapy on muscle symptoms: an individual participant data meta-analysis of large-scale, randomised, double-blind trials [^115SQPiQ]. Lancet (2022). Excellent credibility.

Currently, the management of patients reporting muscle symptoms while taking statin therapy is challenging, since the belief that statin therapy often causes such symptoms is encouraged by drug labelling and other misleading sources of information (contributing to the so-called nocebo or drucebo effect, where negative expectations can lead to perceived adverse effects). By contrast, our results confirm that, in the majority of cases, statin therapy is not likely to be the cause of muscle pain in a person taking statin therapy. This finding is particularly true if the treatment has been well tolerated for a year or more before developing symptoms; but, even during the first year of a moderate-intensity statin regimen, it is likely to be the cause in only approximately one in 15 patients who report muscle symptoms, rising to approximately one in 10 in those who are taking a more intensive regimen. In other words, the statin is not the cause of muscle symptoms in more than 90% of individuals who report such symptoms.

In conclusion, this individual participant data meta-analysis of randomised trials has found that statin therapy causes a small proportional increase in reports of muscle pain, largely during the first year after treatment commences. These findings have shown that symptoms might differ from those observed in patients with myopathy (patients might report myalgia, cramps, limb pain, fatigue or weakness, or some other musculoskeletal pain) with no good evidence that the proportional risk increases vary between different types of patients or statins of equivalent LDL-lowering abilities, but some evidence that the proportional risk increase is higher for more intensive statin regimens than for moderate-intensity statin regimens. However, for all patients for whom statin therapy might be considered, the quantitative evidence from previous analyses of large trials within the CTT Collaboration clearly indicate that the risk is greatly outweighed by the cardiovascular benefits of statins. Our findings suggest that there is a need to review recommended strategies for managing such symptoms, and to revise the information in the drug label for statins. In particular, for patients who report mild muscle symptoms when taking a statin, our findings suggest that it is most likely that the symptoms are not due to the statin, and statin therapy should continue until other potential causes have been explored.

Risk of bias

We rated the overall risk of bias as low across all 48 included trials; 29 trials raised concerns (online supplemental file 1). We rated 14 (29%) studies as high risk of bias because the number of missing participants was higher than 20% or the analysis was not done by an intention-to-treat protocol. We rated 18 (38%) trials as high risk of bias owing to inadequate masking of participants and personnel, 14 (29%) trials owing to an open label design, and four (8%) trials because the trial design did not have a matching placebo. The overall scores of the Newcastle-Ottawa quality assessment scale were six to seven among the included observational studies, indicating some risks of bias (table 3; online supplemental table S11).

Table 3
Treatments, outcomes, and risk of bias of included observational studies

Meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials

As shown in figure 3, moderate to high certainty evidence indicated that ezetimibe has little to no effect on the risks of cancer (relative risk 1.01; 95% confidence interval 0.92 to 1.11), fractures (0.90; 0.74 to 1.10), discontinuation due to any adverse events (0.87; 0.74 to 1.03), discontinuation due to gastrointestinal adverse events (1.34; 0.58 to 3.08), myalgia or muscular pain leading to discontinuation (0.82; 0.51 to 1.33), neurocognitive events (1.48; 0.58 to 3.81), or new-onset diabetes (0.88; 0.61 to 1.28). We downgraded the certainty of the evidence to moderate for discontinuation due to any adverse events for indirectness because of the composite nature of the outcome. We also downgraded the certainty of evidence of discontinuation due to any gastrointestinal adverse events and neurodegenerative events for imprecision because of wide 95% confidence intervals, which could not support clinical decision making.

### CLEAR serenity trial: more clarity for the future of bempedoic acid in patients unable to take statins? [^115MVhfn]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

The most common statin‐associated adverse effect is musculoskeletal symptoms, which may range from mild (aches) to severe (rhabdomyolysis). Potential risk factors for statin‐associated muscle symptoms include advanced age, high physical activity, drugs affecting statin metabolism, renal insufficiency, heavy alcohol consumption, and genetic predisposition. More important, statin‐associated muscle symptoms are the most frequent adverse effects leading to statin nonadherence and discontinuation. 6 In patients who cannot tolerate their current statin regimen, strategies include either adjusting dosages, frequency, or type of statins, with or without the addition of nonstatin agents, or transitioning to nonstatin agents altogether.

Fortunately, the arsenal of nonstatin therapy at a clinician's disposal has expanded in recent years. Ezetimibe and PCSK9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9) serine protease inhibitors have been validated in large randomized controlled trials to lower LDL‐C and also lower ASCVD events. 7, 8, 9 Although these trials were all conducted on a background of statin therapy, their efficacy in patients who cannot take full‐dose statins may be cautiously extrapolated. At the same time, both ezetimibe and PCSK9 inhibitors are relatively well tolerated, supporting these agents over older medications, such as bile acid–binding resins (Figure). Yet, both ezetimibe and PCSK9 inhibitors have their limitations. Ezetimibe has modest LDL‐C–lowering efficacy in the range of 13% to 20%. 4 PCSK9 inhibitors have more robust LDL‐C–lowering effects (43%–64%), but they are administered as an injection, have not been studied for long‐term safety and efficacy, and, at their current prices, may not be cost‐effective. 4

### (ezetimibe and atorvastatin) (Lypqozet) [^114AARmW]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.1 Myopathy/Rhabdomyolysis

Atorvastatin

Rare cases of rhabdomyolysis with acute renal failure secondary to myoglobinuria have been reported with atorvastatin and with other drugs in this class. A history of renal impairment may be a risk factor for the development of rhabdomyolysis. Such patients merit closer monitoring for skeletal muscle effects.

Atorvastatin, like other statins, occasionally causes myopathy, defined as muscle aches or muscle weakness in conjunction with increases in creatine phosphokinase (CPK) values > 10 times upper limit of normal (ULN). The concomitant use of higher doses of atorvastatin with certain drugs such as cyclosporine and strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., clarithromycin, itraconazole, and HIV protease inhibitors) increases the risk of myopathy/rhabdomyolysis.

Myopathy should be considered in any patient with diffuse myalgias, muscle tenderness or weakness, and/or marked elevation of CPK. Patients should be advised to report promptly unexplained muscle pain, tenderness or weakness, particularly if accompanied by malaise or fever or if muscle signs and symptoms persist after discontinuing ezetimibe and atorvastatin tablets. Ezetimibe and atorvastatin tablets therapy should be discontinued if markedly elevated CPK levels occur or myopathy is diagnosed or suspected.

The risk of myopathy during treatment with statins is increased with concurrent administration of cyclosporine, fibric acid derivatives, erythromycin, clarithromycin, the hepatitis C antiviral agents telaprevir, a combination of elbasvir plus grazoprevir, combinations of HIV protease inhibitors, including saquinavir plus ritonavir, lopinavir plus ritonavir, tipranavir plus ritonavir, darunavir plus ritonavir, fosamprenavir, and fosamprenavir plus ritonavir, niacin, or azole antifungals. Physicians considering combined therapy with ezetimibe and atorvastatin tablets and fibric acid derivatives, erythromycin, clarithromycin, a combination of elbasvir plus grazoprevir, a combination of saquinavir plus ritonavir, lopinavir plus ritonavir, darunavir plus ritonavir, fosamprenavir, or fosamprenavir plus ritonavir, azole antifungals, or lipid-modifying doses of niacin should carefully weigh the potential benefits and risks and should carefully monitor patients for any signs or symptoms of muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness, particularly during the initial months of therapy and during any periods of upward dosage titration of either drug. Lower starting and maintenance doses of ezetimibe and atorvastatin tablets should be considered when taken concomitantly with the aforementioned drugs [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Periodic CPK determinations may be considered in such situations, but there is no assurance that such monitoring will prevent the occurrence of severe myopathy.

### Ezetimibe-related myopathy: a systematic review [^116aZBQv]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2008). Low credibility.

Ezetimibe is a synthetic 2-azetidinone that inhibits the absorption of sterols, including cholesterol, in the intestine. It is used as monotherapy or in combination with statins to reduce low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). Although extremely well-tolerated, there are reports of myopathy associated with ezetimibe. We performed a PubMed search through April 2008 to identify English language articles examining ezetimibe safety as monotherapy or in combination with other lipid-lowering agents. The incidence of musculoskeletal disorders in clinical trials using ezetimibe alone or in combination with statins is identical to placebo or the statin alone, respectively. We identified only six case reports of possible ezetimibe-associated myopathy. We concluded that ezetimibe neither produces nor exacerbates statin myopathy except, possibly, in rare cases.

### Assessment and management of statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS): a clinical perspective from the National Lipid Association [^111Fv2Jw]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2022). High credibility.

National Lipid Association statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS) management — many patients ultimately tolerate statins, and strategies include lower-dose statin, different statin, supplementation, and/or non-statins with defined low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) effects at specific doses and in combination therapy. The text states that approximately 60–80% of patients with SAMS are eventually able to tolerate some statin regimen and lists management strategies consisting of 1) same statin but lower dose, 2) different statin, 3) supplementation, and/or 4) non-statins. LDL-C lowering with statins is greatest at the lowest daily dose, which may achieve 2/3 of maximum effect with an additional 5–6% reduction from baseline with each doubling of dose; starting with atorvastatin 10 mg or rosuvastatin 5 mg offers a moderate intensity response that can result in a 33–45% reduction in LDL-C. Over 50% reduction in LDL-C can be achieved by adding ezetimibe or other non-statin pharmacotherapies to low to moderate-intensity statin treatment. In RACING, rosuvastatin 10 mg daily plus ezetimibe 10 mg daily versus rosuvastatin 20 mg daily was associated with lower drug discontinuation (4.8% vs 8.2%, p < 0.0001) and greater achievement of LDL-C < 70 mg/dL at years 1, 2, and 3 (73%, 75%, 72% vs 55%, 60%, 58%, all p < 0.0001). For persistent intolerance during low-dose therapy, intermittent (non-daily) dosing may be needed, and it is recommended to use statins with a longer half-life; there are accounts of 20–40% LDL-C lowering depending on dose and dosing interval.

Figure 1
Effect on muscle adverse events in trials of any statin regimen versus placebo (A) and more versus less intensive statin regimens (B)

Bold data are the totals or subtotals. O–E = observed minus expected. Var = variance.

Statin therapy produced a 7% relative increase in muscle pain or weakness during the first year (RR 1.07; 95% CI 1.04–1.10), but no significant increase thereafter (0.99; 0.96–1.02; p value for heterogeneity for year 1 vs all subsequent years was 0.0005; figure 2). An increased risk was already present within the first 3 months after random assignment to treatment (1.08, 99% CI 1.02–1.15; figure 2). The aggregate rate of reporting of any muscle pain or weakness (ie, for statin and placebo groups combined) during the first year of treatment varied substantially by trial (appendix p 10), from 1.0% to 60.5%, reflecting heterogeneity in how actively information was sought. Despite this, there was no evidence that the RR for the comparison of statin versus placebo depended on the absolute reporting rate. By applying the RRs in the first and subsequent years to the average rates over these periods among patients allocated to the placebo group, allocation to a statin regimen resulted in an absolute excess rate of muscle pain or weakness of 11 (95% CI 6 to 16) per 1000 person-years in the first year and 0 per 1000 person-years (–2 to 1) in subsequent years (figure 3). Approximately 1 in 15 (calculated as [1.07–1.00]/1.07) reports of muscle symptoms (< 10% of reports) during the first year were attributable to statin therapy.

If LDL-C remains above target despite maximally tolerated statin dosage, addition of an alternative LDL-C lowering agent should be considered in patients at high CVD risk to improve LDL-C reduction. Ezetimibe reduces LDL-C by 15–20%, is easy to take with few side effects, and has been shown to reduce CVD events. In patients with SAMS, the combination of ezetimibe plus fluvastatin XL reduced LDL-C by 46% and was as well tolerated as ezetimibe alone. Bile acid sequestrants can reduce LDL-C levels by 15–25% depending on the type and dose used, and may also improve glycaemia in patients with diabetes. Colesevelam is easier to take and better tolerated than earlier formulations. The combination of a bile acid sequestrant and ezetimibe can reduce LDL-C by ∼30–35%.

Fenofibrate can lower LDL-C by 15–20% in patients with high baseline levels who do not have concomitant hypertriglyceridaemia. This fibrate is easy to take, and has shown an excellent safety record in the Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes and Fenofibrate Intervention and Event Lowering in Diabetes trials, although additional CVD benefit has not been demonstrated, and serum creatinine was reversibly increased during treatment. Unlike gemfibrozil, there is no increased risk of rhabdomyolysis when fenofibrate is added to a statin. Niacin also lowers LDL-C levels by 15–20%, but recent large randomized trials showed a significant excess of adverse effects and no significant CVD benefit when added to background statin treatment; therefore, niacin derivatives are no longer available for prescription in Europe.

Physicians and health care professionals should therefore consider the use of ezetimibe as first choice, potentially followed by bile acid sequestrants or fibrates in combination with ezetimibe, as needed to achieve LDL-C lowering consistent with guidelines.

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 2 [^111vzbPy]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Medium credibility.

Cholesterol absorption inhibitor (ezetimibe) — discontinuation of therapy due to adverse reactions occurs in about 5% of patients and common adverse effects are gastrointestinal with occasional increases in liver enzymes and creatine phosphokinase with muscle symptoms; ezetimibe is administered as a 10 mg tablet once daily; in IMPROVE-IT, ezetimibe with a statin versus a statin alone in 18,144 post-acute coronary syndrome patients produced an additional 16.7 mg/dL (0.4 mmol/L) decrease in LDL-C with on-treatment [1-year] levels of 69.9 and 53.2 mg/dL, respectively, and was associated with a statistically significant 10% reduction in a composite CVD outcome; this reduction aligns with a predicted estimate assuming each 38.7 mg/dL (1 mmol/L) LDL-C lowering produces a 22% ASCVD event risk reduction (16.7 mg/dL ÷ 38.7 mg/dL = 0.4; 0.4 × 22% = 8.8%).

### Efficacy and tolerability of evolocumab vs ezetimibe in patients with muscle-related statin intolerance: the GAUSS-3 randomized clinical trial [^113S3xCg]. JAMA (2016). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Muscle-related statin intolerance is reported by 5% to 20% of patients.

Objective

To identify patients with muscle symptoms confirmed by statin rechallenge and compare lipid-lowering efficacy for 2 nonstatin therapies, ezetimibe and evolocumab.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Two-stage randomized clinical trial including 511 adult patients with uncontrolled low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels and history of intolerance to 2 or more statins enrolled in 2013 and 2014 globally. Phase A used a 24-week crossover procedure with atorvastatin or placebo to identify patients having symptoms only with atorvastatin but not placebo. In phase B, after a 2-week washout, patients were randomized to ezetimibe or evolocumab for 24 weeks.

Interventions

Phase A: atorvastatin (20 mg) vs placebo. Phase B: randomization 2:1 to subcutaneous evolocumab (420 mg monthly) or oral ezetimibe (10 mg daily).

Main Outcome and Measures

Coprimary end points were the mean percent change in LDL-C level from baseline to the mean of weeks 22 and 24 levels and from baseline to week 24 levels.

Results

Of the 491 patients who entered phase A (mean age, 60.7 [SD, 10.2] years; 246 women [50.1%]; 170 with coronary heart disease [34.6%]; entry mean LDL-C level, 212.3 [SD, 67.9] mg/dL), muscle symptoms occurred in 209 of 491 (42.6%) while taking atorvastatin but not while taking placebo. Of these, 199 entered phase B, along with 19 who proceeded directly to phase B for elevated creatine kinase (N = 218, with 73 randomized to ezetimibe and 145 to evolocumab; entry mean LDL-C level, 219.9 [SD, 72] mg/dL). For the mean of weeks 22 and 24, LDL-C level with ezetimibe was 183.0 mg/dL; mean percent LDL-C change, -16.7% (95% CI, -20.5% to -12.9%), absolute change, -31.0 mg/dL and with evolocumab was 103.6 mg/dL; mean percent change, -54.5% (95% CI, -57.2% to -51.8%); absolute change, -106.8 mg/dL (P < .001). LDL-C level at week 24 with ezetimibe was 181.5 mg/dL; mean percent change, -16.7% (95% CI, -20.8% to -12.5%); absolute change, -31.2 mg/dL and with evolocumab was 104.1 mg/dL; mean percent change, -52.8% (95% CI, -55.8% to -49.8%); absolute change, -102.9 mg/dL (P < .001). For the mean of weeks 22 and 24, between-group difference in LDL-C was -37.8%; absolute difference, -75.8 mg/dL. For week 24, between-group difference in LDL-C was -36.1%; absolute difference, -71.7 mg/dL. Muscle symptoms were reported in 28.8% of ezetimibe-treated patients and 20.7% of evolocumab-treated patients (log-rank P = 0.17). Active study drug was stopped for muscle symptoms in 5 of 73 ezetimibe-treated patients (6.8%) and 1 of 145 evolocumab-treated patients (0.7%).

Conclusions and Relevance

Among patients with statin intolerance related to muscle-related adverse effects, the use of evolocumab compared with ezetimibe resulted in a significantly greater reduction in LDL-C levels after 24 weeks. Further studies are needed to assess long-term efficacy and safety.

### Statin-associated muscle symptoms-managing the highly intolerant [^116v86s8]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2017). Low credibility.

Musculoskeletal symptoms are the most commonly reported adverse effects associated with statin therapy. Yet, certain data indicate that these symptoms often present in populations with underlying musculoskeletal complaints and are not likely statin related. Switching statins or using lower doses resolves muscle complaints in most patients. However, there is a growing population of individuals who experience intolerable musculoskeletal symptoms with multiple statins, regardless of the individual agent or prescribed dose. Recent randomized, placebo-controlled trials enrolling highly intolerant subjects provide significant insight regarding statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS). Notable findings include the inconsistency with reproducing muscle complaints, as approximately 40% of subjects report SAMS when taking a statin but not while receiving placebo, but a substantial cohort reports intolerable muscle symptoms with placebo but none when on a statin. These data validate SAMS for those likely experiencing true intolerance, but for others, suggest a psychosomatic component or misattribution of the source of pain and highlights the importance of differentiating from the musculoskeletal symptoms caused by concomitant factors. Managing the highly intolerant requires candid patient counseling, shared decision-making, eliminating contributing factors, careful clinical assessment and the use of a myalgia index score, and isolating potential muscle-related adverse events by gradually reintroducing drug therapy with the utilization of intermittent dosing of lipid-altering agents. We provide a review of recent data and therapeutic guidance involving a focused step-by-step approach for managing SAMS among the highly intolerant. Such strategies usually allow for clinically meaningful reductions in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and an overall lowering of cardiovascular risk.

Table 5 ODYSSEY ALTERNATIVE in patients with primary hypercholesterolemia at moderate or high cardiovascular risk with statin intolerance was a randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, active-controlled, parallel group study in which patients with no skeletal-muscle related adverse event (AE) on placebo were randomized to alirocumab, ezetimibe or atorvastatin 10 mg/d for 24 weeks; n = 314 subjects were randomized. Myalgia was the most common AE in all groups; of the 63 randomized to atorvastatin, 14% discontinued treatment due to statin-associated muscle symptoms. Skeletal muscle-related events were less frequent with alirocumab vs. atorvastatin (HR 0.61, 95% CI 0.38–0.88, p = 0.042), and the rate of study treatment discontinuation due to skeletal muscle-related AEs was not different for alirocumab vs. atorvastatin or vs. ezetimibe.

### Effect of statin therapy on muscle symptoms: an individual participant data meta-analysis of large-scale, randomised, double-blind trials [^113ZrCXi]. Lancet (2022). Excellent credibility.

Summary

Background

Statin therapy is effective for the prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and is widely prescribed, but there are persisting concerns that statin therapy might frequently cause muscle pain or weakness. We aimed to address these through an individual participant data meta-analysis of all recorded adverse muscle events in large, long-term, randomised, double-blind trials of statin therapy.

Methods

Randomised trials of statin therapy were eligible if they aimed to recruit at least 1000 participants with a scheduled treatment duration of at least 2 years, and involved a double-blind comparison of statin versus placebo or of a more intensive versus a less intensive statin regimen. We analysed individual participant data from 19 double-blind trials of statin versus placebo (n = 123 940) and four double-blind trials of a more intensive versus a less intensive statin regimen (n = 30 724). Standard inverse-variance-weighted meta-analyses of the effects on muscle outcomes were conducted according to a prespecified protocol.

Findings

Among 19 placebo-controlled trials (mean age 63 years [SD 8], with 34 533 [27.9%] women, 59 610 [48.1%] participants with previous vascular disease, and 22 925 [18.5%] participants with diabetes), during a weighted average median follow-up of 4.3 years, 16 835 (27.1%) allocated statin versus 16 446 (26.6%) allocated placebo reported muscle pain or weakness (rate ratio [RR] 1.03; 95% CI 1.01–1.06). During year 1, statin therapy produced a 7% relative increase in muscle pain or weakness (1.07; 1.04–1.10), corresponding to an absolute excess rate of 11 (6–16) events per 1000 person-years, which indicates that only one in 15 ([1.07–1.00]/1.07) of these muscle-related reports by participants allocated to statin therapy were actually due to the statin. After year 1, there was no significant excess in first reports of muscle pain or weakness (0.99; 0.96–1.02). For all years combined, more intensive statin regimens (ie, 40–80 mg atorvastatin or 20–40 mg rosuvastatin once per day) yielded a higher RR than less intensive or moderate-intensity regimens (1.08 [1.04–1.13] vs 1.03 [1.00–1.05]) compared with placebo, and a small excess was present (1.05 [0.99–1.12]) for more intensive regimens after year 1. There was no clear evidence that the RR differed for different statins, or in different clinical circumstances. Statin therapy yielded a small, clinically insignificant increase in median creatine kinase values of approximately 0.02 times the upper limit of normal.

Interpretation

Statin therapy caused a small excess of mostly mild muscle pain. Most (> 90%) of all reports of muscle symptoms by participants allocated statin therapy were not due to the statin. The small risks of muscle symptoms are much lower than the known cardiovascular benefits. There is a need to review the clinical management of muscle symptoms in patients taking a statin.

### Effect of statin therapy on muscle symptoms: an individual participant data meta-analysis of large-scale, randomised, double-blind trials [^111X4z8C]. Lancet (2022). Excellent credibility.

The main strength of our analyses is that they provide the first reliable estimates of the causal contribution of statins to muscle symptoms reported by a wide range of patients. The data are derived from large-scale, double-blind, randomised trials, which guarantees the avoidance of both moderate random errors and moderate biases. By contrast, non-randomised observational studies, in which outcomes are compared between individuals who received the treatment of interest and those who did not are (irrespective of their size) prone to moderate biases (especially where participants are aware of which drugs they are taking), which cannot be guaranteed to be removed through statistical adjustment (eg, propensity score matching).

However, there are some potential limitations to our analyses. Firstly, there was considerable heterogeneity in the methods used for the ascertainment of muscle symptoms, and definitions varied from trial to trial. Nonetheless, as noted above, the relative excesses appeared to be broadly consistent among the different trials and clinical circumstances. Secondly, although we sought adverse event data from all randomised, double-blind trials included in the CTT, some data were not available. However, the missing data represented less than 1% of all adverse events,(mainly because of data privacy concerns). Furthermore, data were not consistently available on whether muscle events led to the discontinuation of allocated treatment (and thus planned on-treatment analyses for rare events were not possible), and there was no reliable information on some relevant comorbid conditions (such as hypothyroidism) or concomitant medications that might affect the risk of having symptoms. Thirdly, most reports of muscle pain or weakness were not accompanied by a measurement of creatine kinase value, so we were unable to assess whether some symptoms were associated with large increases in creatine kinase concentrations. However, among the cases for which there were data available on creatine kinase concentrations, more than 96% were less than 3 times the ULN, and there was no evidence that (after removing myopathy cases) extreme creatine kinase values were more common among participants allocated to the statin groups. Finally, although all trials excluded anyone known to have had a previous serious adverse reaction to statin therapy, and many took steps to exclude those with a previous statin sensitivity or hypersensitivity, most of them did not seek to identify or exclude participants who might now be categorised as statin intolerant (most of the trials had completed enrolment before statins were in common use and well before they were available generically).

Myopathy and other muscle pain or weakness

Myopathy was prospectively defined as otherwise unexplained muscle pain or weakness with CK > 10× ULN (within 28 days). The majority of myopathy cases presented to their managing clinician between scheduled clinic visits, and all cases were adjudicated by a clinician at the study co-ordinating centre. A report during follow-up of new unexplained muscle pain or weakness that was not associated with a diagnosis of myopathy (within 28 days) was defined as 'other muscle symptoms'. A subset of these individuals with CK > 5 ≤ 10× ULN was also examined.

### Pearls&Oy-sters: managing cholesterol in a patient with statin intolerance due to anti-HMG-CoA reductase-associated myopathy [^113qzcNQ]. Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Statins are the first line of treatment for hypercholesterolemia and of prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). It is estimated that 1 in 4 Americans over the age of 40 years use statins. In rare cases, patients may develop an autoimmune myopathy associated with antibodies against 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR). Anti-HMGCR-associated myopathy requires immediate discontinuation of statins plus initiation of immunosuppressive therapy. Suspension of statin treatment worsens low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) control, leading to an increased risk of ASCVD and necessitating commencement of another treatment for dyslipidemia. Unfortunately, the management of dyslipidemia in these patients is still unclear. In this study, we describe the case of a 65-year-old woman with dyslipidemia treated with atorvastatin, who consulted for long-standing muscle pain associated with symmetrical proximal weakness. Laboratory tests showed elevated levels of creatine kinase and anti-HMGCR antibodies. She was diagnosed with an anti-HMGCR-associated myopathy and was successfully treated with corticosteroids and azathioprine as immunosuppressive therapy, followed by ezetimibe for LDL-C reduction. We present key findings for early recognition and treatment of anti-HMGCR-associated myopathy and give recommendations on how to manage hypercholesterolemia in a patient with statin intolerance due to this disease.

Discussion

Previous randomised trials and meta-analyses of trials, as well as N-of-1 trials of statin therapy, have not been able to resolve whether statin therapy might lead to a small increased risk of muscle pain. We aimed to evaluate the causal effects of statin therapy on muscle events of differing types and severity, and to explore how any excess risk varied over time, in different types of individual, and for different statin regimens. On the basis of individual participant data on all recorded muscle events in large-scale, long-term statin trials, our study yielded many findings that enhanced understanding of the nature and risks of muscle symptoms caused by statin therapy.

Notably, we have reliably shown that the small excess risk of muscle symptoms due to statin therapy largely occurred within the first year of treatment. Other studieshave shown that the risks of statin-associated muscle symptoms or statin intolerance are highest in the period after commencing therapy with a statin, but since a large proportion of such events are not due to statin therapy, such studies do not help in furthering understanding of the causal role of statins over time. There were similar excesses of risk in different types of muscle symptoms, including those categorised clinically as myalgia, muscle cramps or spasm, limb pain, other musculoskeletal pain, or muscle fatigue or weakness, but we found that muscle symptoms caused by statin therapy were no more severe than the average severity of symptoms not caused by a statin. The different statins of equivalent LDL-lowering ability included in our meta-analysis had similar effects on muscle symptoms. The relative excess was similar in different types of patients, and irrespective of how muscle symptoms were defined, hence our results are likely to be widely generalisable. Although we did not find any clear evidence of a dose-response relationship, more intensive regimens caused a greater increase in muscle symptoms than moderate-intensity regimens in the first year of treatment (11% vs 6%), and there was some evidence that a small excess with more intensive regimens might persist for longer than 1 year.

### Managing statin myopathy [^1124PhEZ]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

Approximately 10% of patients treated with statins experience some form of muscle-related side effects in clinical practice. These can range from asymptomatic creatine kinase (CK) elevation, to muscle pain, weakness, and its most severe form, rhabdomyolysis. Higher risk patients for statin myopathy are those older than 80, with a small body frame, on higher statin doses, on other medications, or with other systemic diseases including hepatic or renal diseases, diabetes mellitus, or hypothyroidism. The cause of statin myopathy is presumed to be the same for its variable presentation but has not been defined. In patients with myopathic symptoms, their symptoms and CK levels determine whether statin therapy can be continued or must be stopped.

### Efficacy and safety of adding ezetimibe to statin therapy among women and men: insight from IMPROVE-IT (improved reduction of outcomes: vytorin efficacy international trial) [^116W9kQN]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

The current analysis shows that intensive LDL‐C lowering therapy with the addition of ezetimibe to simvastatin reduced the first events and total number of events in women, particularly among women who were at high risk. The benefit of adding ezetimibe in secondary prevention in women appears to be most apparent in the reduction of MI. This may differ from aspirin, with men appearing to derive benefit primarily in the reduction of MI and women in the reduction of ischemic stroke. 18

More important, safety events were not increased with ezetimibe in women or men. Although there have been relatively few reports of sex‐specific relationships on adverse events, including muscle‐related events, women are considered to be at higher risk of such events than men, which may contribute to undertreatment. This may be, in part, implicated by sex‐based differences in statin metabolism. 19 It is reassuring that our study showed that there was no evidence of increased myopathy, other muscle‐related adverse events, or any other adverse events in women or men, irrespective of treatment assignment.

### A mechanism for statin-induced susceptibility to myopathy [^115ugytU]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2019). Medium credibility.

Statins are the most widely prescribed drug in the Western world. Their use is predicted to rise further due to recent reductions in the cardiovascular risk threshold for statin prescription across the globe. However, cardiovascular benefits of statins are restricted by adverse effects that limit adherence, and, in turn, increase cardiovascular eventsand mortality. The most common side effects and main reason for discontinuation of therapy emerge from skeletal muscle (statin myopathy or statin-associated adverse muscle symptoms). Although no strict definition of statin myopathy has been universally adopted, we use this term to encompass the full spectrum of the effects of statins on skeletal muscle. This includes mild to moderate muscle symptoms and/or signs (myalgia: muscle pain with stiffness and weakness), as well as more severe potentially life-threatening outcomes (myositis and/or rhabdomyolysis) that are associated with raised creatine kinase. Although physical activity counteracts metabolic and cardiovascular diseases that are prevalent in subjects prescribed statins, exercise has been reported to exacerbate statin myopathy, which may further limit the benefits of statins in those at risk of cardiovascular disease.

Among 19 placebo-controlled trials (mean age 63 years [SD 8], with 34533 [27.9%] women, 59610 [48.1%] participants with previous vascular disease, and 22925 [18.5%] participants with diabetes), during a weighted average median follow-up of 4.3 years, 16835 (27.1%) allocated statin versus 16446 (26.6%) allocated placebo reported muscle pain or weakness (rate ratio [RR] 1.03; 95% CI 1.01–1.06).

2.2.1 Side effects associated with LLT

Common reasons for declining or discontinuing LLT use include a fear of actual or perceived side effects. Although side effects with LLT are uncommon, statins may cause muscle symptoms and increase the risk of type 2 diabetes, use of ezetimibe may cause gastrointestinal side effects and muscle symptoms, and antiproprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) may cause a local site reaction, influenza‐like symptoms, and nasopharyngitis. In an analysis of data from the Patient and Provider Assessment of Lipid Management (PALM) registry, among 5693 adults recommended for statin therapy, 1511 (26.5%) were not on statin therapy, including 153 patients who declined statin treatment and 464 who discontinued treatment. Among untreated patients, fear of side effects (36.8% of patients) was the most common reason cited for declining statin treatment, whereas perceived side effects (55.0% of patients) was the most frequent reason reported for statin discontinuation (Figure 1; Table 1). Severe adverse effects associated with statins, such as increased risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis, are rare. However, many patients discontinue statin treatment because they believe that statins frequently cause muscle pain, which has been supported by observational studies. Recent double‐blinded n‐of‐1 trials in patients with severe muscle symptoms during statin treatment showed no significant effects of statins on muscle pain compared with placebo, with a low number of patients withdrawing from the trials. This finding suggests that muscle symptoms may be associated with a nocebo effect among statin users.

Background

Current guidelines recommend that patients with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) use high-intensity statin therapy to lower low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol levels by at least 50%, irrespective of age. However, in real-world practice, there is reluctance to maintain statin use in response to side-effects, particularly statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS). Moreover, no randomized trial has been conducted on the safety of statin therapy in elderly patients.

Trial Design

This investigator-initiated, multicenter, randomized clinical trial aimed to investigate the incidence of SAMS and its effect on LDL-cholesterol levels in elderly patients with established ASCVD. Eligible patients were aged 70 years or older with established ASCVD. Consecutive patients who met the inclusion criteria were randomized in a 1:1 fashion to receive either intensive statin monotherapy (rosuvastatin 20 mg) or combination therapy (rosuvastatin/ezetimibe, 5/10 mg). The primary endpoint of the study is SAMS at 6 months with regard to treatment strategy. Positive SAMS results are defined as patients with a proposed statin myalgia index score of 7 or higher. The key secondary end-points are target LDL-cholesterol achievement (LDL < 70 mg/dL), incidence of myopathy, rhabdomyolysis, frequency of drug discontinuation, and creatinine kinase, aspartate transaminase, alanine transaminase, total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, triglyceride, and highly sensitive C-reactive protein levels at 6 months.

Conclusions

The SaveSAMS study is a multicenter, randomized trial that will compare the incidence of SAMS in patients with established ASCVD who are 70 years or older on intensive statin monotherapy to that combination therapy.

### Statin associated muscle symptoms: an update and review [^112EZDf9]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Statin therapy has been shown to have a significant effect on lowering of low-density lipoprotien cholesterol (LDL-C) levels. This subsequently results in cardiovascular (CV) benefit through reduction in major adverse CV disease (CVD) events and overall mortality. Although there is well proven clinical benefit, statin therapy may be discontinued in some patients, and the most common cause for discontinuation is concern for statin-associated muscle symptoms. However, the data on the true prevalence of these symptoms is mixed and continued studies are showing that the symptoms may be less prevalent than previously believed. With statin-associated muscle symptoms being the most common reason for a patient to not be on statin therapy, it is important for physicians to understand how to evaluate for and manage these symptoms. This manuscript provides an overview of statin associated muscle symptoms so that physicians may be able to better manage patients on statin therapy and continue to use these medications when indicated to best reduce future risk of CVD for patients.

### Life-saving medications: the urgent need for guideline adherence and patient acceptance [^114g3nW2]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Among the patients who declined statin therapy in the PALM registry, the reported number one reason was fear of side effects. 1 Patients are often unclear about the benefit versus risk of statins, and instead, focus on information obtained from the Internet or through communication with others. They fear that statins will cause muscle pain and weakness, liver damage, memory problems, and diabetes mellitus; however, the risk of serious adverse effects was very low (< 1%) in clinical trials. Before prescribing a statin medication, a thorough clinician–patient risk discussion must occur, which was introduced in the 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association cholesterol guideline 2 and expanded in the 2018 multisociety cholesterol guideline. 3 The risk discussion begins with estimating a patient's 10‐year ASCVD risk in primary prevention or an explanation of a patient's high‐risk status in secondary prevention. This requires that the clinician be knowledgeable about clinical trial data and known risks and benefits of statin therapy, 14 and be able to communicate this information in a way that the patient will understand it. The risk discussion should also include factors that enhance a patient's risk but are not part of the 10‐year ASCVD risk estimation (eg, family history of premature ASCVD, metabolic syndrome, chronic inflammatory conditions, among others), and learning the patient's preferences, goals, and values in the context of shared decision making.

The clinician–patient risk discussion and the process of shared decision making can take significant time and is a challenge to thoroughly accomplish within a clinical encounter. However, a discussion about potential adverse effects of statins may help the clinician learn what the patient knows about risks or side effects and can correct any misinformation. 15 Over half of the participants in the PALM registry who discontinued statin therapy cited side effects as the reason. 1 It is often helpful at the initial conversation to inform patients that 7 statins are available and they have different pharmacological properties; if a patient has a side effect to 1 statin, often a different statin will be well tolerated. In fact, of the patients who discontinued or were never offered statin therapy in the PALM registry, ≈40% stated they would "very likely" retry or start statin therapy. 1 It is also helpful to state that muscle and joint problems occur for several reasons and to explain that statin‐associated muscle symptoms are usually bilateral and affect the large muscle groups close to the trunk. Finally, letting the patient know that the clinical team is available to discuss concerns by phone is enormously meaningful to patients.

Statin Myopathy

The most common causally related adverse effect of statins is myopathy. Even without myopathic symptoms, simvastatin 40 mg daily impaired adaptation to exercise training and muscle mitochondrial content in participants with metabolic syndrome. 53 In real‐world practice, myalgias and cramps are more common than estimated from clinical trials; in a cardiology clinic in the Netherlands, one‐third of patients reported such problems. 54 Bruckert et al 55 reported in a study of 7924 outpatients taking high‐dose statins that 38% had limitation of even moderate exertion by muscle pain. Rosenbaum et al 56 reported that among 1074 patients taking statins, 62% complained of stiffness, 67% of cramps, and 50% of weakness or a loss of strength during exertion; 42% of patients had major disruption to their everyday life. However, weakness and wasting are less common (≈1%), and rhabdomyolysis is rare (≈0.1%). 57

Statin use prevalence and impact — Because more than 40 million individuals in the United States are taking or have been prescribed statins, even a relatively low incidence of statin-associated side effects can affect hundreds of thousands to millions of individuals nationwide and even more worldwide, and statin intolerance is an important cause of medication discontinuation and is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular events.

### Use of once-weekly statin in combination with ezetimibe in a patient with mitochondrial disease [^112xeuTX]. BMJ Case Reports (2012). Medium credibility.

The authors describe a patient with personal and family history of muscle pains highly suggestive of mitochondrial disease. She presented with familial combined hyperlipidaemia with family history of premature coronary artery disease. After 4-week therapy of 5 mg of rosuvastatin once a week combined with 10 mg of ezetimibe daily, the low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level was markedly decreased from 3.88 to 2.82 mmol/l (27.3% reduction). She has experienced no adverse effects after 6 month treatment. The results suggest that the combination therapy of low-dose once-weekly rosuvastatin and daily ezetimibe could be used as an effective regimen for patients with mitochondrial disease.

### Effect of statin therapy on muscle symptoms: an individual participant data meta-analysis of large-scale, randomised, double-blind trials [^113BHb2Q]. Lancet (2022). Excellent credibility.

Based on the evidence available from the Heart Protection Study, the small excess in risk appeared to be because of events that did not usually lead to treatment discontinuation (consistent with evidence from a previous review of tabular data from statin trials), and did not result in a clinically significant change in creatine kinase. This finding indicates that most of the episodes of muscle pain or weakness caused by a statin were clinically mild. This result also indicates that, since participants with muscle symptoms generally continued treatment, the absence of any significantly increased risk of repeat reports of muscle symptoms after year 1 is not explained by patients with symptoms stopping treatment after having muscle symptoms during the first year.

We were able to explore the generalisability of our findings in several ways. Since most excess risk appears in the period immediately after treatment commences, we restricted our analyses to the first year to increase their sensitivity. There was substantial variation in the methods used to record muscle symptoms, so the first-year rates among participants allocated to the placebo group in the 19 trials of statin versus placebo also varied substantially. Nevertheless, there was little evidence that the RR for muscle pain or weakness varied according to the cumulative frequency of muscle events at 1 year. It is not clear why this is so (other than the absence of statistical power) since it might be expected that the RR should tend towards unity in those trials with higher recorded rates because of a larger proportion of misclassified events (so-called noise). However, when taken together with the general absence of variation in the relative effects of statin therapy on muscle pain or weakness in the subgroups studied, one practical conclusion is that the overall RR might be broadly generalisable in different clinical circumstances. Likewise, the absence of a sex-related difference in the trials comparing more versus less intensive regimens does not support the finding of a higher RR in women than in men in the placebo-controlled trials.

Table 5 GAUSS-3 in patients with elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) intolerant to statins due to muscle-related adverse effects describes Phase A double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover rechallenge with atorvastatin 20 mg/d and Phase B double-blind randomization to ezetimibe or evolocumab; n = 472 subjects completed both conditions during Phase A. Intolerable muscle symptoms were reported in 44.3% with atorvastatin but not placebo, 27.5% with placebo but not atorvastatin, 18.0% with neither treatment, and 10.2% with both treatments; active study drug was stopped for muscle symptoms in 6.8% of ezetimibe-treated patients and 0.7% of evolocumab-treated patients.

Circulation (2019). High credibility.

AHA/ACC cholesterol guideline — risk discussion and assessment for statin therapy states that a clinician–patient risk discussion focused on indications, benefits, risks of statin-associated side effects, and patient concerns and preferences should precede initiation of statin treatment. The majority of statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS) are subjective myalgia (pain, aches) in the absence of other findings; myalgia is more likely to be statin associated if it is bilateral, involves proximal muscles, has onset within weeks to months after initiation of statins, and resolves after discontinuation. A thorough assessment of symptoms is recommended, with evaluation for nonstatin etiologies, assessment of predisposing factors, and a physical exam; future encounters should address statin response, emphasize adherence, and reaffirm benefit.

### Assessment and management of statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS): a clinical perspective from the National Lipid Association [^117KsXne]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2022). High credibility.

Statin intolerance — non-statin therapy options and outcome evidence: Inability to tolerate low doses of 3–4 statins, or not achieving lipid goals on suboptimal statin dosing, is often sufficient to justify initiation of treatment with non-statin therapies. Other non-statin drugs have been proven to reduce cardiovascular events as either monotherapy (cholestyramine, niacin, gemfibrozil), and among these options, ezetimibe and proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibiting monoclonal antibodies are proven to reduce atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) events. In addition, niacin monotherapy reduced ASCVD events in men with ASCVD, but not in combination with statins. The LDL-C-lowering efficacy is modest, but cholestyramine monotherapy is also proven to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events. In some patients treatment with fenofibrate may produce modest LDL-C lowering, but fibrates are primarily indicated for triglyceride-lowering and lack solid evidence of cardiovascular benefit. Management emphasizes achieving LDL-C and non-HDL-C goals while sequentially adding non-statin therapies, because the consequences of not achieving lipid goals are progression of ASCVD and occurrence of cardiovascular events.

### Design and rationale of the GAUSS-2 study trial: a double-blind, ezetimibe-controlled phase 3 study of the efficacy and tolerability of evolocumab (AMG 145) in subjects with hypercholesterolemia who are intolerant of statin therapy [^113NthTe]. Clinical Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

Statins effectively lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), reducing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Most patients tolerate statins well, but approximately 10% to 20% experience side effects (primarily muscle-related) contributing to diminished compliance or discontinuation of statin therapy and subsequent increase in cardiovascular risk. Statin-intolerant patients require more effective therapies for lowering LDL-C. Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) is a compelling target for LDL-C-lowering therapy. Evolocumab (AMG 145) is a fully human monoclonal antibody that binds PCSK9, inhibiting its interaction with the LDL receptor to preserve LDL-receptor recycling and reduce LDL-C. Phase 2 studies have demonstrated the safety, tolerability, and preliminary efficacy of subcutaneous evolocumab in diverse populations, including statin-intolerant patients. This article describes the rationale and design of the Goal Achievement After Utilizing an anti-PCSK9 Antibody in Statin-Intolerant Subjects 2 (GAUSS-2) trial, a randomized, double-blind, ezetimibe-controlled, multicenter phase 3 study to evaluate the effects of 12weeks of evolocumab 140mg every 2weeks or 420mg every month in statin-intolerant patients with hypercholesterolemia. Eligible subjects were unable to tolerate effective doses of ≥ 2 statins because of myalgia, myopathy, myositis, or rhabdomyolysis that resolved with statin discontinuation. The primary objective of the study is to assess the effects of evolocumab on percentage change from baseline in LDL-C. Secondary objectives include evaluation of safety and tolerability, comparison of the effects of evolocumab vs ezetimibe on absolute change from baseline in LDL-C, and percentage changes from baseline in other lipids. Recruitment of approximately 300 subjects was completed in August 2013.

### Striated muscle safety of ezetimibe / simvastatin (vytorin) [^1135MLpV]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2006). Low credibility.

Despite the excellent benefit/risk profile of statins, their use is limited by a dose-related risk of adverse events, particularly those related to muscle toxicity. Ezetimibe/simvastatin (Vytorin) is a cholesterol-lowering therapy that inhibits the intestinal absorption (ezetimibe) and synthesis (simvastatin) of cholesterol. This analysis compared the muscle safety profiles of ezetimibe/simvastatin and simvastatin monotherapy. We reviewed muscle-related adverse event (AE) data from 17 randomized, blinded clinical trials (13 base and 4 extension studies), in which ezetimibe and simvastatin were either co-administered as separate entities or given as a combination tablet to 4,558 patients. The following AE categories were summarized: incidence of musculoskeletal or connective-tissue AEs (all and drug related); discontinuations due to musculoskeletal or connective-tissue AEs (all and drug related); incidence of AEs reported under the term "myalgia" (all and drug related); discontinuation due to myalgia (all and drug related); incidence of "myopathy" (all and drug related); increases in creatine kinase to 3 to < 5, 5 to < 10, and ≥ 10 times the upper limit of normal. For all AE categories examined, the incidence of muscle-related clinical and laboratory AEs or discontinuations due to muscle-related AEs was no more common in patients taking ezetimibe/simvastatin than in those taking simvastatin alone. Thus, the clinical trial experience with ezetimibe/simvastatin suggests that ezetimibe does not enhance or aggravate the muscle effects of simvastatin.

### Pharmacologic options for aggressive low-density lipoprotein cholesterol lowering: benefits versus risks [^1169P3A4]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2005). Low credibility.

Lessons from recent end point trials of lipid-lowering drugs indicate that patients at very high risk for coronary artery disease (CAD) benefit from treatment that lowers low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol plasma levels to ≤ 1.81 mmol/L (≤ 70 mg/dL), that patients with ≥ 2 risk factors benefit from treatment that lowers plasma LDL cholesterol to < 2.59 mmol/L (< 100 mg/dL), and that a significant reduction in CAD event rates is most often associated with a minimum plasma LDL cholesterol reduction of 30%. Recently, the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) Expert Panel on Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Cholesterol in Adults (Adult Treatment Panel III) recommendations were amended to incorporate these lessons. To reach these more aggressive goals and plasma LDL cholesterol reductions, more aggressive therapies will be required. The best way to implement more aggressive therapy is to start with one of the more potent statins, especially atorvastatin or rosuvastatin, or higher doses of other statins. This approach alone is likely to achieve treatment goals in 50% to 80% of patients. For patients needing additional plasma LDL cholesterol lowering, combination therapies will be required. Adding colesevelam, ezetimibe, or niacin to a stable statin regimen will generally provide an additional 10% to 15% lowering of plasma LDL cholesterol. These more potent statins, even when used in higher doses, appear to be safe. The incidence of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis, as documented in long-term clinical trials, is < 0.1% and < 0.01%, respectively, except for simvastatin, which has a higher incidence of these problems. Less information is available about the safety of lowering levels of plasma LDL cholesterol to ≤ 1.81 mmol/L (≤ 70 mg/dL), but an analysis of a recent 2-year-long clinical trial, in which patients had on-treatment plasma LDL cholesterol levels as low as 0.67 mmol/L (26 mg/dL), reported no signals of untoward effects in patients with progressively lower levels.

### Narrative review: statin-related myopathy [^114cjLBh]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Statin-related myopathy is a clinically important cause of statin intolerance and discontinuation. The spectrum of statin-related myopathy ranges from common but clinically benign myalgia to rare but life-threatening rhabdomyolysis. Observational studies suggest that myalgia can occur in up to 10% of persons prescribed statins, whereas rhabdomyolysis continues to be rare. The mechanisms of statin-related myopathy are unclear. Options for managing statin myopathy include statin switching, particularly to fluvastatin or low-dose rosuvastatin; nondaily dosing regimens; nonstatin alternatives, such as ezetimibe and bile acid-binding resins; and coenzyme Q10 supplementation. Few of these strategies have high-quality evidence supporting them. Because statin-related myopathy will probably become more common with greater numbers of persons starting high-dose statin therapy and the increasing stringency of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level targets, research to better identify patients at risk for statin myopathy and to evaluate management strategies for statin-related myopathy is warranted.

### Approach to the patient who is intolerant of statin therapy [^114nQ5Aa]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2010). Low credibility.

Myopathy occurs in approximately 10% of statin-treated patients and is most commonly manifested by myalgias with or without plasma creatine kinase (CK) elevations. Predisposition exists in patients treated with high doses of potent statins and those who are older, female, have a genetic predisposition, and when statins are coadministered with drugs that compete with or inhibit drug metabolism. In symptomatic patients, CK levels may assist in guiding management. If less than five times the upper limit of normal, the existing statin should be titrated to achieve cholesterol goals and the CK repeated when symptoms appear or worsen. In patients with moderate to severe symptoms and any patient with CK elevated to more than 5-fold the upper limit of normal, the statin should be stopped. Once asymptomatic and CK is reduced (if elevated previously), cholesterol goals can be approached by: 1) a different statin (e.g. fluvastatin or pravastatin), starting with a low dose and titrating up; 2) an alternate daily or weekly more potent statin (e.g. rosuvastatin or atorvastatin); or 3) the combination of the lowest tolerated statin with a cholesterol absorption inhibitor (ezetimibe) and/or bile acid sequestrant. Over-the-counter preparations, e.g. red yeast rice, containing natural statin-like agents, or plant sterols can also lower cholesterol. These, however, have limited efficacy to achieve targeted cholesterol levels for most patients. In patients without CK elevations and symptoms, progress can be followed clinically, but in patients who show CK elevations, CK should be monitored. At present, the superiority of one approach has not been demonstrated, and the need for clinical trials in well-characterized patients with statin intolerance cannot be dismissed.

### Review of side-effect profile of combination ezetimibe and statin therapy in randomized clinical trials [^116tmSXN]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2008). Low credibility.

Effective treatment to achieve target lipid parameters in high-risk patients may require combination drug therapies. Concerns regarding risks associated with such combination therapies may limit their use. A systematic overview of randomized controlled trials to assess risks associated with combination statin and ezetimibe therapy was performed. Eighteen trials were identified, including 14,471 patients. Follow-up ranged from 6 to 48 weeks. Compared with statin monotherapy, combination therapy did not result in significant absolute increases in risks of myalgias (risk difference -0.033, 95% confidence interval [CI] -0.06 to -0.01), creatine kinase increases (risk difference 0.011, 95% CI -0.02 to 0.04), rhabdomyolysis (risk difference -0.003, 95% CI -0.01 to 0.004), transaminase increases (risk difference -0.003, 95% CI -0.01 to 0.005), gastrointestinal adverse events (risk difference 0.005, 95% CI -0.03 to 0.04), or discontinuations because of an adverse event (risk difference -0.005, 95% CI -0.03 to 0.02). In conclusion, based on available randomized trials, the addition of ezetimibe to statin therapy did not increase the risk of myalgias, creatine kinase increases, rhabdomyolysis, transaminase increases, gastrointestinal adverse events, or discontinuations because of an adverse event. Additional trials are necessary to ensure that results of clinical trials are consistent with routine clinical practice, particularly in older patients with more co-morbid conditions and patients on higher statin doses.

Statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS) management — statin tolerability can be further optimized through dose reductions, changing to a different statin, or intermittent dosing, with evidence suggesting approximately 60–80% of patients with SAMS are eventually able to tolerate some statin regimen; when statin monotherapy is insufficient to achieve low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C) goals, non-statin therapies need to be used prioritizing therapies with proven cardiovascular benefit, and treatment is incomplete until LDL-C and non-HDL-C goals have been achieved.

### Statin-associated muscle symptoms: impact on statin therapy-European Atherosclerosis Society consensus panel statement on assessment, aetiology and management [^111BQaTC]. European Heart Journal (2015). Low credibility.

The clinical presentation of muscle symptoms is highly heterogeneous, as reflected by the variety of definitions in the literature (see). Muscle pain or aching, stiffness, tenderness or cramp (often referred to as 'myalgia') attributed by patients to their statin use is usually symmetrical but may be localized, and can be accompanied by muscle weakness; any of these effects occur predominantly without an elevation of CK.

As indicated above, reported rates of muscle symptoms are invariably lower in blinded RCTs when compared with those in registries and observational studies, with myalgia rates similar in subjects on statin or placebo. –, Admittedly, patients with comorbidities that would predispose to an increased risk for musculoskeletal symptoms may have been underrepresented in RCTs. In addition, dedicated questionnaires into muscle complaints are not always incorporated within trial methodology. Conversely, the lack of a placebo comparator in observational studies precludes the ability to establish a causal relationship between statin and muscle complaints. The Effects of Statins on Muscle Performance (STOMP) study is, to our knowledge, the only randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study specifically designed to examine the effect of statins on skeletal muscle symptoms and performance. Among the 420 statin-naïve subjects randomized to atorvastatin 80 mg daily or placebo for 6 months, 9.4% of the statin-treated and 4.6% of control subjects met the study definition of myalgia (P = 0.054), suggesting that the incidence of muscle complaints due to the statin is considerably less than that reported in observational trials. The STOMP study also found no differences in the measures of muscle strength or exercise performance between statin-treated and placebo subjects. Few other RCTs have queried for muscle complaints among participants. Muscle complaints in other clinical trials have been similar in statin-treated and placebo subjects. However, even a small increase in myalgia rates would still represent a substantial number of patients given the widespread use of statins.

### Assessment and management of statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS): a clinical perspective from the National Lipid Association [^1179TmQJ]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2022). High credibility.

Statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS) — prevalence and management overview — are described as the most common form of statin intolerance and are associated with increased risk of cardiovascular events that manifest from statin underutilization and discontinuation; the prevalence of SAMS is estimated to be about 10% (range 5% to 25%) and the prevalence of pharmacological SAMS to be about 1–2% (range 0.5% to 4%). In clinical practice, SAMS are likely to result from a combination of pharmacological and nonpharmacological effects, and treatment strategies include optimizing lifestyle interventions, modulating risk factors that may contribute to muscle symptoms, optimizing statin tolerability by dose reduction, decreased dosing frequency, or use of an alternate statin with more favorable pharmacokinetic properties, and use of non-statins emphasizing those with evidence for atherosclerotic risk.

### Ezetimibe and simvastatin [^1175s91k]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.1 Recommended Dosing

The usual dosage range is 10 mg/10 mg/day to 10 mg/40 mg/day. The recommended usual starting dose is 10 mg/10 mg/day or 10 mg/20 mg/day. Ezetimibe and simvastatin tablets should be taken as a single daily dose in the evening, with or without food. Patients who require a larger reduction in LDL-C (greater than 55%) may be started at 10 mg/40 mg/day in the absence of moderate to severe renal impairment (estimated glomerular filtration rate less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2). After initiation or titration of ezetimibe and simvastatin tablets, lipid levels may be analyzed after 2 or more weeks and dosage adjusted, if needed.

2.2 Restricted Dosing for 10 mg/80 mg

Due to the increased risk of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, particularly during the first year of treatment, use of the 10 mg/80 mg dose of ezetimibe and simvastatin tablets should be restricted to patients who have been taking ezetimibe and simvastatin tablets 10 mg/80 mg chronically (e.g., for 12 months or more) without evidence of muscle toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Patients who are currently tolerating the 10 mg/80 mg dose of ezetimibe and simvastatin tablets who need to be initiated on an interacting drug that is contraindicated or is associated with a dose cap for simvastatin should be switched to an alternative statin or statin-based regimen with less potential for the drug-drug interaction.

Due to the increased risk of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, associated with the 10 mg/80 mg dose of ezetimibe and simvastatin tablets, patients unable to achieve their LDL-C goal utilizing the 10 mg/40 mg dose of ezetimibe and simvastatin tablets should not be titrated to the 10 mg/80 mg dose, but should be placed on alternative LDL-C-lowering treatment(s) that provides greater LDL-C lowering.

### Optimizing cholesterol treatment in patients with muscle complaints [^116uPHLm]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

Statins are highly effective for preventing cardiovascular events by reducing low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). However, many patients taking statins report muscle-related symptoms that prevent the use of guideline recommended doses. Patients with reported intolerance to statins have a high risk of cardiovascular events. Clinical strategies that optimize cardiovascular risk reduction through LDL-C lowering need to be applied in patients experiencing intolerable side effects that they attribute to statins. In this paper, the authors review definitions of statin intolerance, propose algorithms to better define statin intolerance, and describe approaches to optimize cardiovascular risk reduction among individuals reporting statin-associated muscle symptoms.

How common are statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS) — in the general population, "SAMS occur in approximately ∼10% (range: 5% to 25%) of statin-treated patients", while randomized controlled trial interpretations indicate pharmacologic SAMS occur in " < 1% of patients", and the authors "estimate the prevalence of pharmacologic SAMS to be about 1–2% (range: 0.5% to 4%)". Early clinical-practice estimates were "in the range of 5% to 13%", and among patients previously diagnosed with SAMS in clinical practice, pharmacologic SAMS rates "range from 3.3% to 16.1%". Trial and meta-analytic data "suggested that the majority of participants (≥ 90%) had SAMS that were not caused by the statin".

Statin rechallenge expectations in SAMS counseling emphasize that "it can be helpful to frame expectations regarding tolerability", because "Tolerability discussions provide a helpful perspective for the patient to reflect on functional status and quality of life rather than an expectation for completely symptom-free therapy". Patients should know that "An individual could experience mild tolerable muscle symptoms for the first 2–4 weeks, which later resolve", and that "statin rechallenge may not cause the same symptoms, particularly after a dose reduction or change to another statin", with the aim that "Setting the stage for positive but realistic expectations may facilitate improved patient outcomes".

### Effect of statin therapy on muscle symptoms: an individual participant data meta-analysis of large-scale, randomised, double-blind trials [^11798seB]. Lancet (2022). Excellent credibility.

Statistical analysis

All variables for which the data were extracted were specified previously. Data were converted into a common format on the basis of the Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium Study Data Tabulation Model. Adverse events were mapped to a common dictionary (the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities version 20.0).

The protocol prespecified that analyses of muscle symptoms would consider reported muscle pain (ie, myalgia) and weakness separately from myopathy. Before the unmasking of treatment allocation, non-myopathic muscle outcomes were categorised as: myalgia, limb pain, other musculoskeletal pain, muscle cramp or spasm, any muscle pain (ie, the combination of the previous four outcomes), muscular fatigue or weakness, and any muscle pain or weakness (ie, all the previous outcomes combined; appendix pp 4–5). We searched for creatine kinase values obtained within 2 weeks of the reported events to check for any biochemical evidence of muscle damage, and assessed the effect of the statin on the distribution of all creatine kinase values (reported as multiples of the trial-specific upper limit of normal [ULN]). Although the protocol specified that myopathy would be defined as muscle pain or weakness accompanied by creatine kinase more than ten times the ULN, it was redefined (before unmasking) as any event coded as myopathy or rhabdomyolysis owing to the frequent absence of creatine kinase data.

### Statin-associated muscle symptoms: impact on statin therapy-European Atherosclerosis Society consensus panel statement on assessment, aetiology and management [^111dXzRX]. European Heart Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS) are one of the principal reasons for statin non-adherence and/or discontinuation, contributing to adverse cardiovascular outcomes. This European Atherosclerosis Society (EAS) Consensus Panel overviews current understanding of the pathophysiology of statin-associated myopathy, and provides guidance for diagnosis and management of SAMS. Statin-associated myopathy, with significant elevation of serum creatine kinase (CK), is a rare but serious side effect of statins, affecting 1 per 1000 to 1 per 10 000 people on standard statin doses. Statin-associated muscle symptoms cover a broader range of clinical presentations, usually with normal or minimally elevated CK levels, with a prevalence of 7–29% in registries and observational studies. Preclinical studies show that statins decrease mitochondrial function, attenuate energy production, and alter muscle protein degradation, thereby providing a potential link between statins and muscle symptoms; controlled mechanistic and genetic studies in humans are necessary to further understanding. The Panel proposes to identify SAMS by symptoms typical of statin myalgia (i.e. muscle pain or aching) and their temporal association with discontinuation and response to repetitive statin re-challenge. In people with SAMS, the Panel recommends the use of a maximally tolerated statin dose combined with non-statin lipid-lowering therapies to attain recommended low-density lipoprotein cholesterol targets. The Panel recommends a structured work-up to identify individuals with clinically relevant SAMS generally to at least three different statins, so that they can be offered therapeutic regimens to satisfactorily address their cardiovascular risk. Further research into the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms may offer future therapeutic potential.

### Effect of statin therapy on muscle symptoms: an individual participant data meta-analysis of large-scale, randomised, double-blind trials [^1155bxdG]. Lancet (2022). Excellent credibility.

Added value of this study

We were able to minimise biases by restricting our analyses to large-scale, randomised, double-blind trials of statin therapy versus placebo in which there was systematic and unbiased event reporting. To overcome the potential bias arising from the selected publication of results, we obtained details of all adverse events related to muscle recorded in each individual trial participant, and coded them using the common nosological standard (from the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities). The availability of individual participant data permitted more detailed analyses of risk for each statin than have previously been possible, including analyses examining the effects on particular symptoms, the timing of any excess risk, and the variation in treatment effects in different types of patients. Statin regimens caused a small relative increase (3%) in the number of first reports of muscle symptoms, but the excess of reports due to statin therapy was largely confined to the first year of treatment, during which there was an absolute excess rate of 11 (95% CI 6–16) events per 1000 person-years. Statins had similar effects on a range of reported muscle symptoms, including myalgia, muscle cramps or spasm, limb pain, and other musculoskeletal pain. There was no evidence for variation in the relative effects of different statins. The relative increase in the rate of muscle symptoms was similar in a wide range of trial participants, and was irrespective of the variation in the methods used to ascertain symptoms, suggesting that the observed relative effects of statins on muscle symptoms are likely to be generalisable. Overall, for the regimens studied in these trials, the increase in symptoms was greater for more intensive statin regimens, and a small excess risk was likely to persist for longer, than for less intensive or moderate-intensity regimens. Based on previous analyses of these trials, this excess risk of muscle symptoms is greatly outweighed by the known cardiovascular benefits of statin therapy.

### Ezetimibe added to statin therapy after acute coronary syndromes [^112haygQ]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2015). Excellent credibility.

Ezetimibe added to simvastatin after acute coronary syndromes — double-blind randomized evidence shows incremental LDL lowering and modest clinical benefit. A double-blind, randomized trial involved 18,144 patients hospitalized for an acute coronary syndrome within the preceding 10 days with LDL cholesterol 50 to 100 mg per deciliter (1.3 to 2.6 mmol per liter) on lipid-lowering therapy or 50 to 125 mg per deciliter (1.3 to 3.2 mmol per liter) if not; simvastatin (40 mg) plus ezetimibe (10 mg) (simvastatin–ezetimibe) was compared with simvastatin (40 mg) plus placebo, using a composite primary end point of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, unstable angina requiring rehospitalization, coronary revascularization (≥ 30 days after randomization), or nonfatal stroke, with median follow-up 6 years. Median time-weighted average LDL cholesterol during the study was 53.7 mg per deciliter (1.4 mmol per liter) with simvastatin–ezetimibe versus 69.5 mg per deciliter (1.8 mmol per liter) with simvastatin alone (P < 0.001). The Kaplan–Meier primary end point rate at 7 years was 32.7% with simvastatin–ezetimibe versus 34.7% with simvastatin alone (absolute risk difference, 2.0 percentage points; hazard ratio, 0.936; 95% confidence interval, 0.89 to 0.99; P = 0.016), and rates of myopathy, rhabdomyolysis, gallbladder, and hepatic adverse effects and cancer were similar in the two groups. The authors conclude that when added to statin therapy, ezetimibe resulted in incremental lowering of LDL cholesterol levels and improved cardiovascular outcomes; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00202878.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Statin intolerance — definition and alternatives: Statin intolerance is frequent in clinical practice and the most commonly reported cause is statin-associated muscle symptoms. To consider a patient as having statin intolerance, a minimum of 2 statins should be attempted, including at least 1 at the lowest approved daily dose. Options for complete or partial intolerance include ezetimibe, PCSK9 inhibitor monoclonal antibodies, inclisiran, and bempedoic acid. Bempedoic acid reduces LDL-C levels by 15% to 25%, and a combination product with ezetimibe lowered LDL-C levels by approximately 35%. In CLEAR Outcomes, patients with ACS within 90 days prior to randomization were excluded; the mean LDL-C level was 139 mg/dL at enrollment and was reduced by 29 mg/dL with bempedoic acid compared with placebo. Bempedoic acid raised uric acid levels in a small subset of patients, and rates of abnormal liver function tests, gout, and gallstones were increased with its use in the trial.

### Independent risk factors for simvastatin-related myopathy and relevance to different types of muscle symptom [^114g4cT3]. European Heart Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

A better understanding of factors affecting the risk of myopathy due to statin therapy could help guide safer prescribing in people at higher risk of it (e.g. use of lower doses of more potent statins, perhaps in combination with other LDL-lowering agents) and support more regular monitoring strategies for those in higher-risk groups. When patients do report muscle-related symptoms, measurement of CK levels (particularly during the first year of therapy or after an increase in dose or the addition of interacting medications) is warranted not only to detect the rare cases of myopathy but also to identify individuals with moderately elevated levels who may be more likely to develop myopathy. In addition, the much larger number of patients who do not have elevated CK levels can be reassured that their symptoms are not likely to be a pharmacologic consequence of their statin treatment; therefore, they should not stop their statin therapy and put themselves at increased risk of a heart attack or a stroke.

Current therapy for patients with statin-associated muscle symptoms

Statin-based therapies

If symptoms/CK abnormalities resolve after discontinuation of statin, either treatment with the same statin at a lower dose or switching to an alternative statin should be considered. If tolerated, doses can be up-titrated to achieve LDL-C goal, or as much LDL-C reduction that can be achieved with minimal muscle complaints. If these strategies are not tolerated, alternate day or twice-weekly dosing can be considered to achieve the LDL-C goal. Despite methodological limitations (small size, retrospective, open label, or non-randomized design), studies have shown that either alternate day or twice-weekly dosing strategies can reduce LDL-C by 12–38%, and, importantly, are tolerated by ∼70% of previously intolerant patients. Generally, lower doses of a high intensity statin with a long half-life (atorvastatin, rosuvastatin, and pitavastatin) are more appropriate.

### Myotoxicity associated with lipid-lowering drugs [^1133yvRH]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Lipid-lowering drugs are associated with myotoxicity, which ranges in severity from myalgias to rhabdomyolysis resulting in renal failure and death. Although rhabdomyolysis is rare, muscle symptoms and serum creatine kinase elevations are sufficiently frequent during the course of lipid-lowering drug therapy to pose diagnostic challenges for the clinician. Progress in our understanding of this form of myotoxicity is reviewed.

Recent Findings

Muscle pain and weakness are the cardinal symptoms and often interfere with vigorous exercise. These symptoms may occur with or without serum creatine kinase elevations. The risk of myotoxicity is increased by combination statin-fibrate therapy as well as by factors that elevate tissue levels of the lipid-lowering drug, including the dose, drug-drug interactions, and host factors. Underlying neuromuscular diseases may become clinically apparent during statin therapy and may predispose to myotoxicity. The pathophysiology of myotoxicity most probably involves metabolic effects of the statins on the isoprenoid pool and on mitochondrial function.

Summary

Management of myotoxicity requires an evaluation of risk factors prior to prescribing lipid-lowering drugs, attention to muscle symptoms, and withdrawal of drug in the event of significant abnormalities.

### Efficacy and safety of alirocumab vs ezetimibe in statin-intolerant patients, with a statin rechallenge arm: the ODYSSEY ALTERNATIVE randomized trial [^116sBxsz]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Statin intolerance limits many patients from achieving optimal low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) concentrations. Current options for such patients include using a lower but tolerated dose of a statin and adding or switching to ezetimibe or other non-statin therapies.

Methods

ODYSSEY ALTERNATIVE (NCT01709513) compared alirocumab with ezetimibe in patients at moderate to high cardiovascular risk with statin intolerance (unable to tolerate ≥ 2 statins, including one at the lowest approved starting dose) due to muscle symptoms. A placebo run-in and statin rechallenge arm were included in an attempt to confirm intolerance. Patients (n = 361) received single-blind subcutaneous (SC) and oral placebo for 4 weeks during placebo run-in. Patients reporting muscle-related symptoms during the run-in were to be withdrawn. Continuing patients were randomized (2:2:1) to double-blind alirocumab 75 mg SC every 2 weeks (Q2W; plus oral placebo), ezetimibe 10 mg/d (plus SC placebo Q2W), or atorvastatin 20 mg/d (rechallenge; plus SC placebo Q2W) for 24 weeks. Alirocumab dose was increased to 150 mg Q2W at week 12 depending on week 8 LDL-C values. Primary end point was percent change in LDL-C from baseline to week 24 (intent-to-treat) for alirocumab vs ezetimibe.

Results

Baseline mean (standard deviation) LDL-C was 191.3 (69.3) mg/dL (5.0 [1.8] mmol/L). Alirocumab reduced mean (standard error) LDL-C by 45.0% (2.2%) vs 14.6% (2.2%) with ezetimibe (mean difference 30.4% [3.1%], P < .0001). Skeletal muscle-related events were less frequent with alirocumab vs atorvastatin (hazard ratio 0.61, 95% confidence interval 0.38–0.99, P = 0.042).

Conclusions

Alirocumab produced greater LDL-C reductions than ezetimibe in statin-intolerant patients, with fewer skeletal-muscle adverse events vs atorvastatin.

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 1 – full report [^111oD8yT]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Medium credibility.

Statin intolerance and side effects — evaluation and management — notes that symptoms reported with statin use include mainly muscle-related complaints (myalgias), and observational studies have failed to find significant evidence for memory loss in those on longer-term statin therapy, despite anecdotal reports of short-term memory impairment. Because musculoskeletal complaints are common without statin therapy, an evaluation of such complaints to assess other possible causes should be undertaken before attributing symptoms to statins, and concomitant therapies may interact with statins, increasing the risk of muscle symptoms. For patients with statin intolerance, symptoms may improve when switched to a different statin; other strategies that may be used include limiting the daily dosage and modified regimens such as every other day or once weekly dosing with statins that have a long half-life. In some patients, it may be possible to switch to an alternative concomitant therapy to enhance statin tolerance, and for patients who cannot tolerate a statin within the previously discussed strategies, a nonstatin drug alone or in combination with another cholesterol-lowering agent may be considered. A modest increase in risk for type 2 diabetes mellitus has been observed with statin therapy in RCTs, and higher intensity statin therapy appears to increase risk to a greater extent than less-intensive regimens.

### Comparison of PCSK9 inhibitor evolocumab vs ezetimibe in statin-intolerant patients: design of the goal achievement after utilizing an anti-PCSK9 antibody in statin-intolerant subjects 3 (GAUSS-3) trial [^116T8ByS]. Clinical Cardiology (2016). Low credibility.

Statins are the accepted standard for lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). However, 5% to 10% of statin-treated patients report intolerance, mostly due to muscle-related adverse effects. Challenges exist to objective identification of statin-intolerant patients. Evolocumab is a monoclonal antibody that binds proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), resulting in marked LDL-C reduction. We report the design of Goal Achievement After Utilizing an Anti-PCSK9 Antibody in Statin-Intolerant Subjects 3 (GAUSS-3), a phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, ezetimibe-controlled study to compare effectiveness of 24 weeks of evolocumab 420 mg monthly vs ezetimibe 10 mg daily in hypercholesterolemic patients unable to tolerate an effective statin dose. The study incorporates a novel atorvastatin-controlled, double-blind, crossover phase to objectively identify statin intolerance. Eligible patients had LDL-C above the National Cholesterol Education Project Adult Treatment Panel III target level for the appropriate coronary heart disease risk category and were unable to tolerate ≥ 3 statins or 2 statins (one of which was atorvastatin ≤ 10 mg/d) or had a history of marked creatine kinase elevation accompanied by muscle symptoms while on 1 statin. This trial has 2 co-primary endpoints: mean percent change from baseline in LDL-C at weeks 22 and 24 and percent change from baseline in LDL-C at week 24. Key secondary efficacy endpoints include change from baseline in LDL-C, percent of patients attaining LDL-C < 70 mg/dL (1.81 mmol/L), and percent change from baseline in total cholesterol, non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and apolipoprotein B. Recruitment of 511 patients was completed on November 28, 2014.

8.5 Geriatric Use

Of the 10,189 patients who received ezetimibe and simvastatin tablets in clinical studies, 3,242 (32%) were 65 and older (this included 844 (8%) who were 75 and older). No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. Since advanced age (≥ 65 years) is a predisposing factor for myopathy, ezetimibe and simvastatin tablets should be prescribed with caution in the elderly [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Because advanced age (≥ 65 years) is a predisposing factor for myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, ezetimibe and simvastatin tablets should be prescribed with caution in the elderly. In a clinical trial of patients treated with simvastatin 80 mg/day, patients ≥ 65 years of age had an increased risk of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, compared to patients < 65 years of age [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

8.6 Renal Impairment

In the SHARP trial of 9,270 patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (6,247 non-dialysis patients with median serum creatinine 2.5 mg/dL and median estimated glomerular filtration rate 25.6 mL/min/1.73 m2, and 3,023 dialysis patients), the incidence of serious adverse events, adverse events leading to discontinuation of study treatment, or adverse events of special interest (musculoskeletal adverse events, liver enzyme abnormalities, incident cancer) was similar between patients ever assigned to ezetimibe and simvastatin tablets, 10 mg/20 mg (n = 4,650) or placebo (n = 4,620) during a median follow-up of 4.9 years. However, because renal impairment is a risk factor for statin-associated myopathy, doses of ezetimibe and simvastatin tablets exceeding 10 mg/20 mg should be used with caution and close monitoring in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.5), Adverse Reactions (6.1), and Clinical Studies (14.3)].

8.7 Hepatic Impairment

Ezetimibe 10 mg orally every day lowers LDL-C by 12% to 25% as mono-Rx and by 25% when added to statin through inhibition of intestinal and biliary cholesterol absorption; reported adverse effects include myalgias, fatigue, URI symptoms, and GI symptoms. Bile acid sequestrants reduce LDL-C 8% to 16% as mono-Rx via efficient binding of bile acids that lowers hepatic cholesterol and promotes LDL-R upregulation, with adverse effects including GI symptoms, constipation, and binding of other drugs.

### Statin intolerance: a literature review and management strategies [^116saeR9]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Statin intolerance is a commonly encountered clinical problem for which useful management strategies exist. Although many patients report statin-related muscle symptoms, studies indicate that the majority of these patients can tolerate a statin upon re-challenge. Alternative statin dosing strategies are an effective way to modify and reintroduce statin therapy for patients reporting adverse symptoms. Correction of vitamin D deficiency and hypothyroidism may improve statin tolerability in some patients. CoQ10 supplementation has been found to be of no benefit for statin-related muscle symptoms in most recent clinical trials. PCSK9 inhibitors are a new therapeutic option that if confirmed as safe and effective by outcomes trials may be of substantial benefit to select patients at high ASCVD risk who are unable to achieve adequate low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) lowering on maximally tolerated statin therapy. Other available medications to lower LDL-C in statin intolerant patients include ezetimibe, bile acid sequestrants, niacin, and fibrates.

### Cost-effectiveness of lipid lowering with statins and ezetimibe in chronic kidney disease [^117LzcN3]. Kidney International (2019). Medium credibility.

Several limitations of the present analyses should be acknowledged. First, SHARP included only CKD patients without a prior history of myocardial infarction or coronary revascularization, whereas, in routine practice, coronary heart disease is highly prevalent in people with moderate-to-advanced CKD. Therefore, patients outside SHARP at similar CKD stages are likely to be at higher cardiovascular risk. However, the cost-effectiveness estimates corresponding to categories of risk are likely to be generalizable to such patients. Second, since SHARP did not directly assess the effects of ezetimibe monotherapy in patients with CKD, we incorporated an assumption that its effects on clinical outcomes are equivalent, per mmol/L reduction in LDL cholesterol, to those of statins. This assumption was derived from the results of the CTT meta-analysis of the effects of statin-based regimens at different levels of eGFRand by the IMPROVE-IT trial, which was conducted in people with an acute coronary syndrome treated with statinand demonstrated further cardiovascular risk reductions with ezetimibe similar to those with statin-only regimens achieving similar LDL cholesterol reductions. Third, the effect of treatments on non–health care costs, such as productivity or long-term care costs, were not included in the present analysis, which was conducted exclusively from a health services perspective. Finally, safety of statin-based regimens has been a subject of debate despite the acknowledgement that any adverse effects are rare and benefits strongly outweigh any harm. We did not include adverse effects in our primary analysis due to the paucity of data for different treatments. However, sensitivity analyses incorporating estimated rates of potential adverse effects on muscle (e.g. myopathy and rhabdomyolysis) and diabetes yielded similar results.

In conclusion, statin-based treatments effectively reduce cardiovascular risk in nondialysis patients with CKD and, at current prices and cost-effectiveness thresholds, the available evidence suggests that low-cost statin/ezetimibe combination therapy is cost-effective. The most cost-effective regimen is one that maximizes the dose of statin chosen without compromising safety.
