## Question

hypercoaguable state due to factor 5 or 7 mutation

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether a hypercoagulable state is due to a factor 5 or factor 7 mutation, and how to think about risk, testing, and management in each case. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the terminology and ensure we are actually discussing factor V Leiden versus factor VII deficiency. Then, I should verify the underlying mechanisms and true thrombotic risk profiles. Next, I will review clinical manifestations and special contexts like pregnancy and unusual venous sites. After that, I need to check diagnostic strategies and pitfalls, followed by guideline-based indications for testing. Finally, I will synthesize management and prophylaxis implications and answer the core question precisely, distinguishing inherent hypercoagulability from trigger-dependent thrombosis in factor VII deficiency.

> Let me first confirm the terminology because precision matters here: "factor 5 mutation" in the thrombosis context almost always refers to factor V Leiden (FVL), a gain-of-function F5 variant causing activated protein C resistance and a prothrombotic phenotype, whereas "factor 7 mutation" typically refers to factor VII deficiency, a loss-of-function F7 condition primarily associated with bleeding; wait, let me verify the paradox reported in factor VII deficiency — yes, thrombotic events can occur in FVII-deficient patients, but these are uncommon and usually trigger-dependent rather than reflecting an inherently hypercoagulable baseline state [^114jXXRt] [^111A4HF3] [^11737RvU].

> I will now examine mechanisms to anchor risk attribution: factor V Leiden arises from the R506Q missense change that abrogates an APC cleavage site, leading to APC resistance and sustained thrombin generation; I initially recalled the VTE risk in heterozygotes as roughly 2–3 fold, but hold on, I should double-check — some sources report about a four- to five-fold increase for a first VTE, underscoring a moderate-risk thrombophilia with expression modulated by coexistent factors, so I should acknowledge both estimates and emphasize clinical context dependency [^111A4HF3] [^114HuRft] [^117Me2so] [^114jXXRt].

> Next, I should review the "thrombotic paradox" in factor VII deficiency; although the primary phenotype is bleeding, over 30 thromboembolic events have been documented in FVII-deficient patients, typically in the setting of surgical procedures, replacement therapy — especially products containing activated factors — or antiphospholipid syndrome, and importantly, low FVII activity does not protect against thrombosis, meaning the risk is not zero but is largely trigger dependent; therefore, peri-operative thrombotic prophylaxis merits consideration in selected FVII-deficient patients, though the optimal modalities still require definition [^11737RvU].

> Let me think about clinical manifestations and special venous sites because these inform testing and management; FVL is classically associated with DVT and PE and can present in unusual sites including cerebral venous sinuses and splanchnic beds such as Budd-Chiari syndrome and portal vein thrombosis, and case-control and guideline data highlight FVL as a risk factor in these hepatic venous disorders and support thrombophilia testing in such presentations, which I should confirm aligns with EASL recommendations for BCS and PVT [^111A4HF3] [^113F2RT6] [^113BJLcU] [^1177sFzy] [^113GRTUu].

> I need to check pregnancy-related risks and absolute event rates to contextualize counseling; women with heterozygous FVL have about a 1.1% overall risk of pregnancy-associated VTE with higher risk postpartum and substantially higher absolute risk in homozygotes, so anticipatory guidance and selective prophylaxis, particularly postpartum or with additional risk factors, is reasonable; SOGC guidance also suggests considering postpartum thromboprophylaxis in heterozygous FVL when clinical or pregnancy-related risk factors are present, which I should keep in mind for individualized planning [^115JN2hG] [^112estAc].

> Next, I should review diagnostic testing and pitfalls; for FVL, functional APC resistance assays are cost-effective and clinically relevant, while genotyping confirms the F5 R506Q mutation, but wait, I should verify known exceptions — yes, "pseudo-wild-type" scenarios exist where a second F5 missense variant normalizes the APC ratio despite heterozygous FVL, and rare laboratory errors or allele-specific amplification problems can also yield false negatives, whereas multiple anticoagulants and lupus anticoagulant can confound functional assays; thus, reconciling phenotype and genotype with clinical context is essential before making management decisions [^115qFxUv] [^113Dmumk] [^115yuVCr] [^1113sXyz] [^117MjGvX].

> Hold on, I should verify guideline indications for testing because indiscriminate screening can mislead care; ASH 2023 advises strongly against testing the general population before starting combined oral contraceptives and against using FVL testing to guide hormone therapy, and BSH 2022 recommends not obtaining routine genetic testing to predict a first VTE, whereas EASL recommends testing for inherited thrombophilia, including FVL and prothrombin G20210A, in Budd-Chiari syndrome and portal vein thrombosis; selective testing is also considered in certain pregnancy-related familial thrombophilia contexts, but broad panels rarely change acute management [^115DEvFD] [^111iiAhS] [^113qgAdX] [^115bg7GY] [^1137Gayh] [^113BJLcU] [^114qeAX6].

> I will now examine management principles pragmatically; for FVL, acute VTE is treated per standard pathways with DOACs or VKAs, and decisions on duration hinge on provocation status and bleeding risk rather than the mere presence of FVL, while primary prophylaxis may be warranted transiently in high-risk settings such as major surgery, postpartum, or with combined defects; for FVII deficiency, care centers on bleeding management and careful use of hemostatic agents, but wait, I should confirm the thrombotic side — yes, peri-operative VTE prophylaxis should be considered in contexts with known triggers for thrombosis given that low FVII does not confer protection [^111A4HF3] [^11737RvU].

> Let me directly answer the core question and be explicit; a hypercoagulable state is inherently attributable to factor 5 Leiden because it is a gain-of-function mutation causing APC resistance and prothrombotic tendency, whereas factor 7 mutations generally cause a bleeding disorder, not a primary hypercoagulable state; however, I must not jump to conclusions in FVII deficiency because thrombosis can still occur under specific triggers like surgery or replacement therapy, so vigilance and context-specific prophylaxis are important despite the baseline bleeding phenotype [^114jXXRt] [^111A4HF3] [^11737RvU].

> I should confirm population and individual risk modifiers to complete the picture; FVL is present in about 5% of individuals of European ancestry but is rare in many Asian and African populations, combined thrombophilias and environmental triggers amplify risk, and clinical risk scores in hospitalized patients treat "known thrombophilia" as one component rather than a deterministic factor, reinforcing the need to integrate genotype with clinical context rather than over-interpret a single variant result [^114HuRft] [^1159e4GN] [^113P9eDz].

Factor V Leiden is the most common inherited hypercoagulable state [^114TvTz4], causing **APC resistance** [^115qFxUv] and a **3–8-fold increased VTE risk** in heterozygotes, with much higher risk in homozygotes [^111A4HF3] [^117Me2so]. Factor VII mutations are **not established causes of hypercoagulability** [^11737RvU]; they are typically linked to **bleeding**, with rare thrombotic events usually due to other factors [^11737RvU]. Diagnosis of Factor V Leiden uses **APC resistance assays** [^115qFxUv] and confirmatory genetic testing [^114TvTz4]; management follows **standard anticoagulation**, with individualized duration based on risk factors and recurrence risk [^111A4HF3] [^116tPPPb].

## Factor V Leiden mutation

### Genetic and molecular basis

Factor V Leiden results from a single nucleotide substitution (G1691A) in the F5 gene, resulting in an **Arg506Gln (R506Q)** change [^111A4HF3] [^114jXXRt]. The mutation confers resistance to APC inactivation, prolonging factor Va activity and increasing thrombin generation [^115qFxUv] [^111A4HF3].

---

### Clinical manifestations

- **VTE risk**: 3–8-fold increase in heterozygotes; 50–100-fold in homozygotes [^111A4HF3] [^114TvTz4].
- **Events**: DVT, PE [^111A4HF3], and thrombosis in unusual sites (e.g. cerebral, mesenteric, portal veins) [^113F2RT6].
- **Pregnancy**: Increased risk of miscarriage, stillbirth, preeclampsia, and placental abruption [^111A4HF3].

---

### Diagnostic methods

An **APC resistance assay** is the functional screening test [^115qFxUv] [^114jXXRt] [^111A4HF3]. Confirmation is by F5 gene DNA analysis to identify the mutation [^114TvTz4].

---

### Management strategies

- **Acute VTE**: Standard anticoagulation (heparin, warfarin, or DOACs) [^111A4HF3] [^112zc5WW].
- **Duration**: Individualized based on recurrence risk and bleeding risk [^111A4HF3] [^116tPPPb] [^111zHyG1].
- **Prophylaxis**: Consider in high-risk settings (surgery, pregnancy, immobilization) [^111A4HF3] [^115DEvFD] [^112estAc].

---

## Factor VII mutations

### Genetic and molecular basis

Factor VII initiates coagulation via the extrinsic pathway. F7 mutations typically cause **deficiency with bleeding**; thrombotic events are rare and usually attributable to other factors [^11737RvU].

---

### Clinical manifestations

Bleeding is common in **factor VII deficiency**. Thrombosis is rare and often linked to surgery, replacement therapy, or antiphospholipid syndrome [^11737RvU].

---

### Diagnostic methods

FVII coagulant activity is measured with a **coagulant activity assay**. Genetic testing identifies F7 mutations.

---

### Management strategies

Bleeding is treated with **replacement therapy** (recombinant FVIIa or plasma-derived products). Thrombosis is managed with **standard anticoagulation** when indicated [^11737RvU].

---

## Comparative summary

| **Factor v leiden** | **Factor VII mutations** |
|-|-|
| Common inherited thrombophilia | Rarely associated with hypercoagulability |
| Increased VTE risk | Primarily associated with bleeding |
| Diagnosed by APC resistance assay and genetic testing | Diagnosed by FVII activity assay and genetic testing |
| Managed with standard anticoagulation | - Managed with replacement therapy for bleeding <br/> - Anticoagulation if thrombosis occurs |

---

Factor V Leiden is a **well-established cause of hypercoagulability** with increased VTE risk, whereas factor VII mutations are typically not associated with hypercoagulability [^114TvTz4] [^11737RvU].

## References

### Is the coexistence of thromboembolic events and factor VII deficiency fortuitous [^11737RvU]. Thrombosis Research (2012). Low credibility.

Over 30 thromboembolic events have been reported in factor VII (FVII) deficiency, either associated with previously asymptomatic forms or bleeding diathesis. Whether this coexistence is fortuitous or not is still a matter of debate. Nevertheless, it is well acknowledged that:

- **Thrombotic events are rare**: Thrombotic events occurring in FVII-deficient patients without any apparent triggering factors are very rare.
- **Triggering factors**: Surgical procedures, replacement therapy (especially those containing activated factors), and the presence of antiphospholipid syndrome are frequently associated with these particular thrombotic events.
- **Genetic variants prevalence**: R304Q and A294V FVII variants appear to be more prevalent than other equally frequent FVII mutations.
- **Coagulant activity levels**: Low FVII coagulant activity levels do not protect against thrombosis.

Therefore, peri-operative thrombotic prophylaxis should be relevant for these particular FVII-deficient patients. However, the safety, treatment modalities, and specific indications of such antithrombotic prophylaxis remain to be established.

### Factor V Leiden thrombophilia [^111A4HF3]. Genetics in Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Factor V Leiden is a genetic disorder characterized by a poor anticoagulant response to activated protein C and an increased risk for venous thromboembolism. Deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism are the most common manifestations, but thrombosis in unusual locations also occurs. The evidence suggests that the mutation has at most a modest effect on recurrence risk after initial treatment of a first venous thromboembolism. Factor V Leiden is also associated with a 2- to 3-fold increased relative risk for pregnancy loss and possibly other obstetric complications, although the probability of a successful pregnancy outcome is high.

The clinical expression of Factor V Leiden is influenced by the number of Factor V Leiden alleles, coexisting genetic and acquired thrombophilic disorders, and circumstantial risk factors. Diagnosis requires the activated protein C resistance assay (a coagulation screening test) or DNA analysis of the F5 gene, which encodes the Factor V protein. The first acute thrombosis is treated according to standard guidelines. Decisions regarding the optimal duration of anticoagulation are based on an individualized assessment of the risks for venous thromboembolism recurrence and anticoagulant-related bleeding.

In the absence of a history of thrombosis, long-term anticoagulation is not routinely recommended for asymptomatic Factor V Leiden heterozygotes, although prophylactic anticoagulation may be considered in high-risk clinical settings. In the absence of evidence that early diagnosis reduces morbidity or mortality, decisions regarding testing should be made carefully.

### Activated protein C resistance and factor V Leiden: A review [^114jXXRt]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Factor V Leiden (FVL) is the most common heritable cause of venous thrombosis. It is caused by a single nucleotide substitution resulting in an R506Q missense mutation, which results in factor V resistance to activated protein C (APC) inactivation. Carriers of FVL have an increased susceptibility to venous thrombosis, which is further increased in the presence of other genetic or environmental risk factors.

- **Objective**: The objective is to review the biology, clinical findings, laboratory detection methods, and screening recommendations for patients with the FVL mutation.

- **Data sources**: A PubMed review of published literature and online information was conducted.

- **Conclusions**: FVL remains an important heritable cause of hypercoagulability since its discovery more than 10 years ago. Clinical suspicion should be high in cases of unexplained venous thrombosis. APC resistance and the FVL mutation can be diagnosed with high sensitivity and specificity with the use of clotting time-based functional assays and genetic assays, respectively. This allows for evidence-guided clinical decision-making regarding the benefit of long-term anticoagulation.

### Markers of activated coagulation in patients with factor V Leiden and/or G20210A prothrombin gene mutation [^116j1pYU]. Thrombosis Research (2002). Low credibility.

The activated protein C (APC) resistance phenotype associated with an abnormal factor V Leiden (FVL) and the G20210A prothrombin gene mutation are the most common findings in patients with venous thromboembolism (VTE). In a group of 210 patients, we compared the levels of markers of coagulation activation in carriers of FVL (71 heterozygous, 30 homozygous), the G20210A prothrombin mutation (88 heterozygous), or both mutations combined (21 heterozygous), to assess whether these markers allow the identification of a group of patients with a higher risk of thrombosis compared to normal values. A total of 143 patients had a personal history of VTE and 67 were asymptomatic. None of them had other hereditary causes of thrombophilia or antiphospholipid syndrome, and none were currently treated with either anticoagulant or hormonal treatment. Pregnant women were excluded.

No significant difference between the four groups of patients could be found in the levels of F1+2, TAT, and DDI, though levels were all significantly higher than the control values (p < 0.05). The levels of F1+2 and TAT were similar in patients with or without a history of VTE, regardless of the type of mutation. DDI levels were significantly higher in patients with a history of VTE than in asymptomatic subjects (443 ± 248 vs. 333 ± 222 ng/ml, p = 0.02) but with only 57% sensitivity and specificity.

In conclusion, our study confirms the hypercoagulable state found in mutation carriers and highlights the inability of F1+2 and TAT assays to identify a group of subjects at higher risk of thrombosis within carriers.

### Advances in laboratory testing for thrombophilia [^117MjGvX]. American Journal of Hematology (2012). Low credibility.

Testing for hereditary thrombophilia typically includes tests for activated protein C resistance (APC-R) and/or factor V Leiden, protein C, protein S, antithrombin, and prothrombin G20210A. New options for these assays have become available in recent years, with different advantages and disadvantages among the currently available methods.

Potential interferences for each assay type are discussed, including lupus anticoagulants, heparin, warfarin, direct thrombin inhibitors (such as argatroban, dabigatran, hirudin, or bivalirudin), rivaroxaban, factor deficiencies or elevations, factor V Leiden, and specific mutations that the assay(s) might not be able to detect. Causes of acquired deficiencies are also described, as these must be carefully excluded before diagnosing a hereditary deficiency of protein C, protein S, or antithrombin.

### Risk of recurrent venous thrombosis in homozygous carriers and double heterozygous carriers of factor V Leiden and prothrombin G20210A [^111zHyG1]. Circulation (2010). Low credibility.

Homozygous or double heterozygous factor V Leiden and/or prothrombin G20210A is a rare inherited thrombophilic trait. Whether individuals with this genetic background have an increased risk of recurrent venous thrombosis is uncertain.

- **Methods and results**: A case-control design within a large cohort of families with thrombophilia was chosen to calculate the risk of recurrent venous thrombosis in individuals with homozygosity or double heterozygosity of factor V Leiden and/or prothrombin G20210A. Cases were individuals with recurrent venous thrombosis, and controls were those with only one venous thrombosis. The cohort consisted of 788 individuals with venous thrombosis; 357 had factor V Leiden, 137 had prothrombin G20210A, 27 had factor V Leiden and/or prothrombin G20210A homozygosity, and 49 had double heterozygosity for both mutations. We identified 325 cases with recurrent venous thrombosis and 463 controls with only one venous thrombosis. Compared with noncarriers, the crude odds ratio for recurrence was 1.2 (95% confidence interval, 0.9 to 1.6) for heterozygous carriers of factor V Leiden, 0.7 (95% confidence interval, 0.4 to 1.2) for prothrombin G20210A, 1.2 (95% confidence interval, 0.5 to 2.6) for homozygous carriers of factor V Leiden and/or prothrombin G20210A, and 1.0 (95% confidence interval, 0.6 to 1.9) for double heterozygotes of both mutations. Adjustments for age, sex, family status, first event type, and concomitance of natural anticoagulant deficiencies did not alter the risk estimates.

- **Conclusions**: In this study, individuals with homozygous factor V

### Prevalence of factor V G1691A (factor V-Leiden) and prothrombin G20210A gene mutations in a recurrent miscarriage population [^117HBek7]. American Journal of Hematology (2002). Low credibility.

Factor V G1691A (FV-Leiden) and prothrombin G20210A mutations are major inherited risk factors for venous thrombosis. Recently, it was suggested that both mutations, through stimulation of venous and placental thrombosis events, were strongly associated with idiopathic miscarriages, although other studies disputed such a link. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of prothrombin G20210A and factor V G1691A (R506Q, FV-Leiden) mutations in women with idiopathic abortions and to recommend management for high-risk mutation carriers.

One hundred ten women with two or more consecutive unexplained first-trimester miscarriages (mean age ± SD, 32.3 ± 5.3) were compared to 67 parous women with uncomplicated pregnancies (mean age ± SD, 33.9 ± 7.3) (P = 0.134) from the same ethnic background. The presence or absence of the prothrombin G20210A and FV-Leiden mutations was assessed by PCR and RFLP analysis, using HindIII and MnlI digestion, respectively.

- **Study findings**: In women with primary habitual abortion, 45 (40.91%) carried the FV-Leiden mutation (7 homozygotes and 38 heterozygotes), and 15 (13.64%) carried the prothrombin G20210A mutation, all as heterozygotes. This compares to 16.42% and 2.99% carrier rates among controls, respectively, all of whom were heterozygote carriers. Of the other risk factors analyzed, smoking (OR 1.76; 95% CI = 0.79–3.94) was more prevalent in habitual aborters compared to controls.

Both FV-Leiden and factor II G20210A mutations are major inherited risk factors associated with primary recurrent miscarriage.

### Do factor V Leiden and prothrombin G20210A mutations predict recurrent venous thromboembolism in older patients [^116tPPPb]. The American Journal of Medicine (2017). High credibility.

The value of genetic thrombophilia testing in elderly patients with an unprovoked venous thromboembolism is unclear. We assessed whether the Factor V Leiden and the prothrombin G20210A mutation are associated with recurrent venous thromboembolism in elderly patients in a prospective multicenter cohort study.

- **Methods**: We genotyped the Factor V Leiden and the prothrombin G20210A mutation in 354 consecutive in- and outpatients aged ≥ 65 years with a first unprovoked venous thromboembolism from 9 Swiss hospitals. Patients and managing physicians were blinded to testing results. The outcome was recurrent symptomatic venous thromboembolism during follow-up. We examined the association between the Factor V Leiden and the prothrombin G20210A mutation and venous thromboembolism recurrence using competing risk regression, adjusting for age, sex, and periods of anticoagulation as a time-varying covariate.

- **Results**: Overall, 9.0% of patients had a Factor V Leiden and 3.7% had a prothrombin G20210A mutation. At 36 months of follow-up, patients with a Factor V Leiden and a prothrombin G20210A mutation had a cumulative incidence of recurrent venous thromboembolism of 12.9% (95% confidence interval, 5.1%-30.8%) and 18.5% (95% CI, 4.9%-56.5%) respectively, compared with 16.7% (95% CI, 12.5%-22.1%) of patients without mutation (P = 0.91 by the log-rank test). After adjustment, neither the Factor V Leiden (sub-hazard ratio 0.98; 95% CI, 0.35–2.77) nor the prothrombin G20210A mutation (sub-hazard ratio 1.15; 95% CI, 0.25–5.19) was associated with recurrent venous thromboembolism.

### When to suspect hypercoagulability and how to investigate it [^114H3e3w]. Annals of Diagnostic Pathology (2001). Low credibility.

The authors summarize the knowledge in the area of novel risk factors for venous thrombosis, addressing both genetic and acquired causes of hypercoagulability. The increasing list of genetic defects predisposing carriers to thrombosis, along with the growing availability of assays to test for them, has made hypercoagulability a subject of significant discussion. This review highlights issues regarding hypercoagulability that pathologists, who are not specialists in coagulation, should be familiar with to provide consultation to other physicians. An educated approach to diagnosing this newly described group of disorders will ensure a more cost-effective and efficient approach to patient care for those at risk.

### American Society of Hematology 2023 guidelines for management of venous thromboembolism: Thrombophilia testing [^115DEvFD]. Blood Advances (2023). High credibility.

Hereditary and acquired thrombophilia are risk factors for venous thromboembolism (VTE). Whether testing helps guide management decisions is controversial. These evidence-based guidelines from the American Society of Hematology (ASH) intend to support decision-making about thrombophilia testing. ASH formed a multidisciplinary guideline panel covering clinical and methodological expertise and minimizing bias from conflicts of interest. The McMaster University GRADE Centre provided logistical support, performed systematic reviews, and created evidence profiles and evidence-to-decision tables. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach (GRADE) was used. Recommendations were subject to public comment.

The panel agreed on 23 recommendations regarding thrombophilia testing and associated management. Nearly all recommendations are based on very low certainty in the evidence due to modeling assumptions. The panel issued a strong recommendation against testing the general population before starting combined oral contraceptives (COCs) and conditional recommendations for thrombophilia testing in the following scenarios: (a) patients with VTE associated with nonsurgical major transient or hormonal risk factors; (b) patients with cerebral or splanchnic venous thrombosis, in settings where anticoagulation would otherwise be discontinued; (c) individuals with a family history of antithrombin, protein C, or protein S deficiency when considering thromboprophylaxis for minor provoking risk factors and for guidance to avoid COCs/hormone replacement therapy.

### Inherited risk factors for venous thromboembolism [^114Twibc]. Nature Reviews Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

Venous thromboembolism (VTE) has important heritable components. In the past 20 years, knowledge in this field has greatly increased with the identification of a number of gene variants causing hypercoagulability. The two main mechanisms are the loss-of-function of anticoagulant proteins and the gain-of-function of procoagulants, the latter owing to increased synthesis or impaired downregulation of a normal protein, or more rarely, to the synthesis of a functionally hyperactive molecule.

Diagnosis of thrombophilia is useful to determine the causes of VTE, recognizing that this multifactorial disease can also be influenced by various acquired factors including cancer, surgery, trauma, prolonged immobilization, or reproduction-associated risk factors. Diagnosis of inherited thrombophilia rarely affects the acute or long-term management of VTE. However, the risk of reVTE is increased in anticoagulant-deficient patients and in homozygotes for gain-of-function mutations. Screening for inherited thrombophilia in thrombosis-free individuals is indicated only for relatives of a proband who is anticoagulant-deficient or has a family history of VTE.

In families with thrombophilia and VTE, primary antithrombotic prophylaxis during risk situations lowers the rate of incident VTE. In this review, we discuss the main causes of inherited thrombophilia, the associated clinical manifestations, and the implications for antithrombotic prophylaxis in the affected individuals.

### Diagnostic ramifications of ocular vascular occlusion as a first thrombotic event associated with factor V Leiden and prothrombin gene heterozygosity [^112zgrPE]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

The most recognized, but neither sensitive nor specific, cardiovascular risk factors for ocular vascular occlusion (OVO) include age, history of smoking, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, and atherosclerosis. More recently, however, there has been increased focus on the pathoetiologic role of thrombophilia in OVO. In the absence of a cardioembolic etiology for OVO, thrombophilia is a common, major cause of ocular thrombotic events. In particular, thrombophilia should be carefully assessed in younger patients, under 65 years old, or in patients with a personal or family history of thrombosis.

Thrombophilia can be heritable, such as in hyperhomocysteinemia, factor V Leiden (FVL) mutation, prothrombin (PTG) G20210A mutation, antithrombin III deficiency, protein C deficiency, or protein S deficiency, or acquired, particularly the lupus anticoagulant found in antiphospholipid syndrome. Of the thrombophilias that are risk factors for OVO, hyperhomocysteinemia is the most likely to cause OVO and is a recognized risk factor for systemic vascular thrombosis, including ischemic heart disease and deep venous thrombosis (DVT). In addition to hyperhomocysteinemia, FVL and PTG heterozygosity result in a systemic hypercoagulable state and are major risk factors for large-vein thrombosis, and thus their role in OVO deserves careful attention.

The FVL mutation involves a G-A substitution at nucleotide 1691 on the factor V gene, resulting in a procoagulant state caused by factor V's resistance to inactivation by protein C. This is one of the commonest familial thrombophilias, with approximately 5% of Caucasian populations affected.

### Contribution of prothrombin 20210A allele and factor V Leiden mutation to thrombosis risk in thrombophilic families with other hemostatic deficiencies [^115ggBQ3]. Haematologica (2001). Low credibility.

The aims of this study were to compare the lifetime probability of developing thrombosis in 722 relatives of 132 thrombophilic families of symptomatic probands with recognized thrombophilic defects and to determine the prevalence of the factor V Leiden (FVL) mutation and the 20210A allele of the prothrombin gene (PT20210A) in these families.

- **Design and methods**: The study included 722 members belonging to 132 unrelated families. The propositi were patients who had been referred to our Thrombosis Unit. The families were selected through a symptomatic proband. Once a patient with a deficiency or mutation was identified, family members were screened for the same defect.

- **Results**: The prevalence of FVL and PT20210A in families with other thrombophilic defects was higher than expected. Compared with non-deficient individuals, the risk of venous thrombosis was increased in subjects with antithrombin (AT), protein S (PS), and protein C (PC) deficiencies, and in carriers of FVL and PT20210A mutations. The risk of thrombosis was significantly increased for individuals with combined genetic defects (PC-FVL, PS-FVL, PS-PT20210A, and FVL-PT20210A). The ages at the time of 50% thrombosis-free survival were as follows: 34 years for AT deficiency (19 years with FVL, 21 years with PT20210A), 62 years for PC deficiency (33 years with FVL, 44 years with PT20210A), 37 years for PS deficiency (24 years with FVL, 36 years with PT20210A), 50 years for the FVL mutation (52 years with PT20210A), and 65 years for the PT20210A mutation.

### Prevalence of the G1691A mutation in the factor V gene (factor V Leiden) and the G20210A prothrombin gene mutation in the Thai population [^1159e4GN]. American Journal of Hematology (2000). Low credibility.

We investigated the prevalence of a genetic variation in the factor V gene (G1691A Leiden mutation) and the prothrombin gene (G20210A) using polymerase chain reaction techniques in samples from 500 normal Thai individuals and among 50 unselected Thai patients with an objectively confirmed history of deep venous thrombosis. The prevalence of factor V Leiden and the prothrombin G20210A gene mutation in a group of 500 healthy controls was 0.2% in both groups (allele frequency of 0.1%). Of the 50 adult patients studied, none was a carrier of factor V Leiden or the prothrombin G20210A gene mutation. Our findings confirm that the prevalence of factor V Leiden and prothrombin G20210A gene mutation is lower among Asians than Caucasians, and that the distribution of factor V Leiden is similar to that of the prothrombin G20210A variant. The low prevalence of these two mutations can, at least in part, account for the lower frequency of deep venous thrombosis reported in the Thai population. Screening for factor V Leiden and prothrombin gene mutation is of limited benefit and may not be cost-effective in Thai patients with the first episode of deep venous thrombosis.

### Factor V Leiden mutation, prothrombin gene mutation, and deficiencies in coagulation inhibitors associated with Budd-Chiari syndrome and portal vein thrombosis: results of a case-control study [^113F2RT6]. Blood (2000). Low credibility.

In a collaborative multicenter case-control study, we investigated the effect of factor V Leiden mutation, prothrombin gene mutation, and inherited deficiencies of protein C, protein S, and antithrombin on the risk of Budd-Chiari syndrome (BCS) and portal vein thrombosis (PVT). We compared 43 BCS patients and 92 PVT patients with 474 population-based controls.

The relative risk of BCS was 11.3 (95% CI 4.8–26.5) for individuals with factor V Leiden mutation, 2.1 (95% CI 0.4–9.6) for those with prothrombin gene mutation, and 6.8 (95% CI 1.9–24.4) for those with protein C deficiency. The relative risk of PVT was 2.7 (95% CI 1.1–6.9) for individuals with factor V Leiden mutation, 1.4 (95% CI 0.4–5.2) for those with prothrombin gene mutation, and 4.6 (95% CI 1.5–14.1) for those with protein C deficiency.

The relative risk of BCS or PVT was not increased in the presence of inherited protein S or antithrombin deficiency. The concurrence of either acquired or inherited thrombotic risk factors was observed in 26% of the BCS patients and 37% of the PVT patients.

We conclude that factor V Leiden mutation and hereditary protein C deficiency appear to be important risk factors for BCS and PVT. Although the prevalence of the prothrombin gene mutation was increased, it was not found to be a significant risk factor for BCS and PVT. The coexistence of thrombogenic risk factors in many patients indicates that BCS and PVT can be the result of a combined effect of different pathogenetic mechanisms.

### Qfitlia [^111CRDt7]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Patients with known co-existing coagulation disorders other than hemophilia A or B, increased risk of thrombosis as assessed by history of arterial or venous thromboembolism, significant valvular disease or atrial fibrillation, or a co-existing thrombophilic disorder (e.g. Factor V Leiden mutation), AT activity < 60% at screening, platelet count ≤ 100,000/μL, eGFR ≤ 45 mL/min (using the MDRD), or clinically significant liver disease were not eligible for enrollment.

The efficacy of QFITLIA AT-DR in ATLAS-OLE was evaluated for a duration of 7 months (primary efficacy period) following a 6-month dose adjustment period. The median observed annualized bleeding rate (IQR) for treated bleeds was 3.7 (0.0; 7.5) overall, 1.9 (0.0; 5.6) in inhibitor patients, and 3.8 (0.0; 11.2) in non-inhibitor patients.

- **Qfitlia prophylaxis compared to on-demand BPA or CFC**: The efficacy results of QFITLIA prophylaxis using AT-DR in ATLAS-OLE compared to on-demand BPA or CFC control data from studies ATLAS-INH and ATLAS-A/B with respect to the rate of treated bleeds, treated spontaneous bleeds, and treated joint bleeds are shown in Table 5 (patients with inhibitors) and Table 6 (patients without inhibitors).

### Different circumstances of the first venous thromboembolism among younger or older heterozygous carriers of the G20210A polymorphism in the prothrombin gene [^116CdBib]. Haematologica (2003). Low credibility.

The G20210A polymorphism in the prothrombin gene is a common cause of inherited thrombophilia. Scarce information is available about the circumstances of the heralding thrombotic manifestation at different ages. The aim of this study was to determine the risk of spontaneous or secondary venous thromboembolism (VTE) among younger and older carriers of the G20210A prothrombin polymorphism.

- **Design and methods**: We performed a case-control study, investigating 650 patients with a first objectively documented deep venous thrombosis of the legs or pulmonary embolism and 703 individuals with no history of vascular disease. In all of them, we carried out laboratory screening for antithrombin III, protein C, and protein S deficiencies, and for the presence of the factor V Leiden and the G20210A prothrombin polymorphisms.

- **Results**: After adjustment for other inherited causes of thrombophilia (deficiency of antithrombin III, protein C or S, factor V Leiden) the overall risk for VTE associated with the prothrombin polymorphism was 3.4 times higher than in the controls (95% CI, 2.0 to 5.8). Stratification according to the age and to the circumstances of the first event revealed an increased risk of spontaneous VTE only among the patients older than 45 years in comparison with age-matched controls (odds ratio 4.4, 95% CI 1.8 to 10.6); among the younger individuals, the risk was increased for secondary VTE (odds ratio 4.8, 95% CI, 2.3 to 9.8) but not for spontaneous VTE.

### A novel factor V mutation causes a normal activated protein C ratio despite the presence of a heterozygous F5 R506Q (factor V Leiden) mutation [^113Dmumk]. British Journal of Haematology (2013). High credibility.

The medical history of the entire family was ascertained and considered when evaluating the "pseudo-wild-type" FVL test results and determining the haemostasis risk burden. None of the subjects had a history of thromboembolic events or any bleeding complications. Therefore, it can be assumed that the thromboembolic risk that is usually associated with a heterozygous F5 R506Q mutation is no longer reliable if missense mutations, e.g. the F5 G1718S mutation located on the same allele as the F5 R506Q mutation, are present.

In summary, the F5 G1718S mutation causes a normal APC ratio despite the presence of a heterozygous F5 R506Q mutation — described as a "pseudo-wild-type" FVL.

In these four cases, testing for only the F5 R506Q genotype would have failed to determine the individual's thromboembolic risk associated with the heterozygous F5 R506Q mutation. As numerous relevant missense mutations may exist on the F5 gene that have not yet been detected or described, clinicians should be aware of this possible discrepancy between genetic (F5 R506Q) and phenotypic (APC resistance) testing for FVL before drawing conclusions for thromboembolic prophylaxis and therapeutic management, especially when prescribing drugs such as combined oral contraceptives or hormonal replacement therapy.

### Predictive and associative models to identify hospitalized medical patients at risk for VTE [^113P9eDz]. Chest (2011). High credibility.

The clinical calculator "IMPROVE risk score for venous thromboembolism" is designed for factor V Leiden, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and prothrombin G20210A. The IMPROVE risk score is a clinical tool for stratifying the risk of venous thromboembolism in hospitalized patients. The primary components of the IMPROVE risk score include:

- **History of previous venous thromboembolism**: Known thrombophilia, lower-limb paralysis, a history of cancer within the past five years, immobilization for seven or more days immediately prior to and during hospital admission, an intensive care unit or coronary care unit stay, and age over 60 years.

Each of these components contributes to the overall risk assessment, allowing clinicians to identify patients at higher risk of venous thromboembolism and guide appropriate prophylactic treatment. The IMPROVE risk score is used to estimate the risk of experiencing a venous thromboembolism (VTE) within three months. It evaluates seven specific clinical factors, assigning numerical values to each factor based on the user's responses. The total score, ranging from 0 to 12, correlates with a specific interpretation of VTE risk. Here's how the scoring works:

- **Previous venous thromboembolism**:
	- **Yes**: 3 points
	- **No**: 0 points

- **Known thrombophilia**:
	- **Yes**: 2 points
	- **No**: 0 points

- **Lower-limb paralysis**:
	- **Yes**: 2 points
	- **No**: 0 points

- **History of cancer (within the past 5 years)**:
	- **Yes**: 2 points
	- **No**: 0 points

- **Immobilized for 7 or more days (just before and during hospital admission)**:
	- **Yes**: 1 point

### Two common genetic thrombotic risk factors: Factor V Leiden and prothrombin G20210A in adult Turkish patients with thrombosis [^1176xxxn]. American Journal of Hematology (2001). Low credibility.

The prevalence of genetic risk factors for thrombosis varies greatly in different parts of the world, both in patients with thrombosis and in the general population. Factor V Leiden (FVL) and prothrombin G20210A (PT G20210A) mutations are the most common genetic defects leading to thrombosis. We have previously reported that these two thrombotic risk alleles are frequently found in Turkish children with thrombosis. The aim of the present study was to investigate the frequency of FVL and PT G20210A and their clinical manifestations in adult Turkish patients with thrombosis.

Between January 1997 and February 2000, 146 patients with documented thrombosis were investigated in our center for the presence of the FVL and PT G20210A mutations. Forty-five of 146 patients with thrombosis (30.8%) were detected to have the FVL mutation. Among those cases with the FVL mutation, seven (4.8%) had the homozygote mutation and 38 (26%) had the heterozygote mutation. The PT G20210A mutation was detected in 10 of the 146 patients with thrombosis (6.8%). Another six cases (4.1%) had both FVL and PT G20210A mutations. The overall frequency of these two common risk alleles in our adult population with thrombosis was 41.6%.

Our findings reveal that FVL and PT G20210A mutations are significant genetic risk factors contributing to the pathophysiology of thrombosis in the Turkish population.

### Venous thromboembolism laboratory testing (factor V Leiden and factor II c.∗97G > A), 2025 revision: A technical standard of the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) [^114TvTz4]. Genetics in Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Venous thromboembolism (VTE) occurs when a blood clot forms in a vein. The etiology of VTE is multifactorial, including both environmental and genetic factors. Among the genetic factors, factor V Leiden and factor II c.∗97G > A (formerly referred to as prothrombin 20210G > A) are the two most common genetic variants associated with VTE. Testing for these variants is one of the most common referrals in clinical genetics laboratories.

Although the methodologies for testing these two variants are relatively straightforward, the clinical implementation can be complicated regarding test indications, risk assessment for occurrence, and recurrence of VTE and related genetic counseling. This document provides an overview of VTE, information about the variants and their influence on risk, considerations before initiating genetic testing, and the clinical and analytical sensitivity and specificity of the tests. Key information that should be included in the laboratory report is also provided. This document supersedes the technical standards and guidelines for venous thromboembolism laboratory testing originally published in 2005 and revised in 2018. It is designed for genetic testing professionals familiar with the disease and the analysis methods.

### Increased activated protein C response rates reduce the thrombotic risk of factor V Leiden carriers but not of prothrombin 20210G > A carriers [^113owGwD]. Circulation Research (2019). Low credibility.

Carriers of the most common prothrombotic mutations, FVL (factor V Leiden) and FII (prothrombin) 20210G > A, show a highly variable clinical phenotype. Using standardized in vivo coagulation activation followed by activity pattern analysis, we have recently shown that the FVL mutation accelerates thrombin and APC (activated protein C) formation in carriers without a history of venous thromboembolism (VTE).

The aim of this prospective cohort study was to investigate if the FII 20210G > A mutation induces a similar reaction pattern, and if the response rates differ in FVL and FII 20210G > A mutation carriers with prior VTE (VTE+).

We comparatively analyzed 30 FVL carriers, 28 FII 20210G > A carriers (including 13 VTE+ each), and 15 healthy controls. Changes in plasma levels of thrombin, prothrombin activation fragment 1+2 (F1+2), TAT (thrombin-antithrombin complex), APC, and D-dimer were monitored over 8 hours after infusion of recombinant factor VIIa (15 µg/kg). An increase of F1+2 and TAT levels was observed, which did not differ between FVL and FII 20210G > A carriers, nor between asymptomatic and VTE+ carriers of these mutations. Median plasma levels of APC increased more significantly (P = 0.008) in FVL carriers (from 1.39 to 7.79 pmol/L) than in FII 20210G > A carriers (from 1.03 to 5.79 pmol/L), and more in FII 20210G > A carriers (P = 2×10⁻⁴) than in healthy controls (from 0.86 to 3.00 pmol/L). Most importantly, the APC response was greater (P = 0.015) in asymptomatic (n = 13) than in VTE+ (n = 12) heterozygous FVL carriers.

### Protein Z influences the prothrombotic phenotype in factor V Leiden patients [^117FzW2m]. Thrombosis Research (2002). Low credibility.

Protein Z enhances the inhibition of factor Xa by protein Z-dependent protease inhibitor (ZPI). Thus, the reduction of protein Z should induce a prothrombotic tendency due to lowered cofactor activity for ZPI. In Factor V Leiden mice, the prothrombotic tendency of severe reduction or lack of protein Z was demonstrated. We present the first studies in humans, indicating that the reduction of protein Z in factor V Leiden patients aggravates thromboembolic risk.

### Role of the geneticist in testing and counseling for inherited thrombophilia [^113yf5zU]. Genetics in Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Within the past decade, the identification of two mutations prevalent among the white population, the factor V Leiden and prothrombin G20210A gene mutations, has paved the way for large cohort studies that have greatly advanced our understanding of the pathogenesis of venous thromboembolism (VTE). VTE is clearly a multigenic disorder, with well-characterized examples of gene-gene and gene-environment interactions underlying its pathogenesis. Increasing numbers of patients are being referred for testing, and more diagnoses of inherited thrombophilia are being made.

The purpose of this article is to discuss the practical applications of both diagnostic testing and genetic counseling for major inherited thrombophilias: inherited resistance to activated protein C/factor V Leiden, prothrombin G20210A mutation, protein C deficiency, protein S deficiency, and antithrombin deficiency. A description of each entity is included, alongside a discussion of the indications for testing, selection of the most appropriate screening test, and proper interpretation of test results. Informed consent for testing, screening of asymptomatic individuals in special circumstances — such as during pregnancy or before initiation of estrogen therapy — screening of family members, and post-test education are also addressed.

This article emphasizes that these polymorphisms should be regarded as risk factors for thrombosis, whose clinical expression generally depends on the coexistence of additional thrombophilic mutations or environmental conditions that provoke the disorder.

### Factors V Leiden and II 20210A in patients with symptomatic pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis [^111sCqRg]. The American Journal of Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Factor V Leiden and factor II 20210A are inherited disorders of the clotting system that occur frequently in patients with deep vein thrombosis. This study aimed to determine whether these factors are also common in patients with pulmonary embolism.

- **Subjects and methods**: We determined the prevalence of factor V Leiden and factor II 20210A in 773 consecutive patients with objectively documented symptomatic deep vein thrombosis, symptomatic pulmonary embolism, or a combination of these disorders.

- **Results**: Isolated symptomatic deep vein thrombosis occurred in 345 patients; isolated symptomatic pulmonary embolism occurred in 236; and both anomalies occurred in 192. Factor V Leiden was present in 21 (9%) of the patients with isolated symptomatic pulmonary embolism, in 30 (16%) with both manifestations, and in 63 (18%) with isolated symptomatic deep vein thrombosis (P = 0.007). Factor V Leiden was more common among patients with deep vein thrombosis (odds ratio [OR] = 2.1; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.2 to 3.7; P = 0.006) or both pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis (OR = 1.8; 95% CI: 1.0 to 3.3; P = 0.07) than among patients with isolated pulmonary embolism. Factor V Leiden was less common in massive pulmonary embolism (5% [7 of 127]) than in submassive pulmonary embolism (13% [21 of 155], P = 0.03). We found no significant difference in the prevalence of factor II 20210A among the three groups.

- **Conclusion**: Factors V Leiden and II 20210A vary in prevalence among patients with pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis, suggesting that the risk differs between these conditions.

### Recommendations from the EGAPP working group: routine testing for Factor V Leiden (R506Q) and prothrombin (20210G > A) mutations in adults with a history of idiopathic venous thromboembolism and their adult family members [^111GSZGR]. Genetics in Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

The Evaluation of Genomic Applications in Practice and Prevention (EGAPP) Working Group found adequate evidence to recommend against routine testing for Factor V Leiden (FVL) and/or prothrombin 20210G > A (PT) in the following circumstances:

1. **Adults with idiopathic venous thromboembolism (VTE)**: In such cases, longer-term secondary prophylaxis to avoid recurrence offers similar benefits to patients with and without one or more of these mutations.

2. **Asymptomatic adult family members of patients with VTE and an FVL or PT mutation**: For the purpose of considering primary prophylactic anticoagulation, potential benefits are unlikely to exceed potential harms.

The overall certainty of these findings was deemed "moderate". The evidence was insufficient to determine whether FVL/PT testing might have clinical utility in some circumstances, such as for identifying FVL homozygosity among asymptomatic family members of adults with idiopathic VTE or counseling patients about the risks and benefits of antithrombotic therapy. Based on the available evidence, the certainty of net health benefit was deemed "low". The recommendations do not extend to patients with other risk factors for thrombosis, such as contraceptive use, as the evidence review that serves as the basis for the recommendations focused primarily on idiopathic VTE.

- **Rationale**: In developing these recommendations, the EGAPP Working Group considered evidence in the following three areas.

### False-negative factor V Leiden genetic testing in a patient with recurrent deep venous thrombosis [^1113sXyz]. American Journal of Hematology (2006). Low credibility.

False-negative genetic testing of the factor V Leiden (fVL) mutation is unusual. We report a case of a young woman with a history of deep venous thrombosis tested for the fVL at four separate laboratories on four separate dates. Two laboratories reported the patient to be heterozygous for the fVL, while the other two reported no evidence of a mutation. Testing methods of the various laboratories were reviewed, and additional testing was performed on stored and newly drawn DNA samples, including sequencing of the fVL gene segment. The preponderance of evidence indicates the patient to be heterozygous for the fVL mutation.

Dissection of data suggests that either sample misidentification or faulty allele specific amplification methods could have led to false-negative results in two laboratories. In one of the two laboratories, misinterpretation of results and clerical error could not be excluded. There is a need for standardization of optimized fVL genetic testing methods. Further education of ordering physicians on the limitations of genetic testing is necessary.

### Severe protein S deficiency associated with heterozygous factor V Leiden mutation in a child with purpura fulminans [^1161kG3u]. Pediatric Hematology and Oncology (2003). Low credibility.

Homozygous or compound heterozygous protein S (PS) deficiency is very rare in the population; only eight patients from six different families have been reported. On the other hand, the factor V Leiden (FVL) mutation is a frequent cause of inherited prothrombotic disorder. Here, the authors report a case of a patient with severe PS deficiency associated with the FVL mutation who has had purpura fulminans since the age of 10 days. She is the first child of a consanguineous marriage. Her father is double heterozygous for PS deficiency and FVL mutation and has recurrent thrombosis. This is the first case of severe PS deficiency combined with the FVL mutation. This suggests the need for complete evaluation of patients with purpura fulminans for thrombotic factors.

### Clotting problems: diagnosis and management of underlying coagulopathies [^113KrS4Z]. Seminars in Vascular Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Vessel wall injury, stasis, and a hypercoagulable state of the blood are major predisposing factors of thrombosis. Although a procoagulable factor is found in half of patients with venous thromboembolism, relatively little is known about coagulopathies that predispose to arterial thromboembolism or unexplained arterial revascularization thrombosis. These hypercoagulable states can be inherited or acquired and related to either an increase in a procoagulable factor or a decrease in an anticoagulation agent. However, most thrombotic episodes seem to occur due to an additive combination of acquired and inherited predisposing factors. Therefore, controversy exists regarding which patients and family members to test for thrombophilia and which patients to treat with lifelong anticoagulation. The aim of this review is to provide a practical overview with guidelines for the detection and treatment of the principal underlying coagulopathies that a vascular surgeon should be aware of in their practice and for the care of patients with vascular disease.

### The association of factor V Leiden with myocardial infarction is replicated in 1880 patients with premature disease [^112tYeFb]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2010). Low credibility.

Gain-of-function variants of genes encoding coagulation factor V (F5 G1691A) and prothrombin (F2 G20210A) cause hypercoagulability and are established risk factors for venous thrombosis. A meta-analysis of 66,155 cases and 91,307 controls found that either polymorphism is associated with a moderately increased risk of coronary artery disease (CAD). Because genetic factors play a particularly important role when acute myocardial infarction (AMI) occurs in the young, we chose to replicate these results by investigating, in the frame of a case-control study, a large cohort of Italian patients who had AMI before the age of 45 years.

In 1880 patients with AMI (1680 men and 210 women) and an equal number of controls, the minor A allele of F5 G1691A (2.6% frequency in cases and 1.7% in controls) was associated with an increased risk of AMI, the association remaining significant after adjustment for traditional risk factors (OR, 1.66; 95% CI, 1.15–2.38; P = 0.006). The positive association with AMI for the minor A allele of F2 G20210A (2.5% frequency in cases and 1.9% in controls) did not reach statistical significance (OR, 1.32; 95% CI, 0.96–1.80; P = 0.159).

In a large cohort of young AMI patients, the gain-of-function variant F5 G1691A was associated with an increased risk of AMI. The findings on the variant F2 G20210A confirmed the previously reported results, but the association was statistically not significant. These data suggest that a number of young patients with AMI carry gene variants associated with a procoagulant phenotype.

### The thrombophilias: Well-defined risk factors with uncertain therapeutic implications [^114ojSVz]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

The discovery of factor V Leiden and prothrombin G20210A mutations has significantly increased the percentage of patients whose venous thrombosis can be attributed to hereditary thrombophilia. The first step in diagnosing all patients with venous thrombosis involves a careful history and physical examination, combined with routine laboratory testing to assess the severity of the thrombotic condition and to find any acquired causes of hypercoagulability.

The second step is to consider screening for causes of hereditary and acquired thrombophilia in selected patient subsets. The selection of patients for testing, the choice of tests to perform, and the timing of the testing are important and challenging issues. Routine testing would be justified if identifying abnormalities led to changes in the type or duration of initial anticoagulant therapy or the use of long-term prophylactic anticoagulation. However, the available data do not yet indicate that most patients with defined thrombophilic states should be managed differently from those without identifiable abnormalities.

Based on the relative prevalence of various thrombophilias, patients can be classified as "strongly" or "weakly" thrombophilic, depending on their thrombotic histories. Management considerations and guidelines are offered for patients found to have one or more defined abnormalities, hereditary or otherwise. Future identification of additional laboratory abnormalities predisposing patients to thrombosis is anticipated.

### Factor V Leiden and the risk of bleeding in patients with acute coronary syndromes treated with antiplatelet therapy: Pooled analysis of 3 randomized clinical trials [^117Me2so]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). High credibility.

Factor V Leiden results from a single-point mutation in the inactivation site of the active factor V, which leads to activated protein C resistance and a prothrombotic state. Heterozygous factor V Leiden is one of the most common genetic thrombophilic defects, with a prevalence of about 5% in the general population of European descent. Carriers of the factor V Leiden polymorphism have a four-fold higher risk of venous thromboembolism. Whether the factor V Leiden polymorphism also increases the risk of atherothrombotic events, such as myocardial infarction and stroke, is controversial. In our recent meta-analysis of individual participant-level data, factor V Leiden was not associated with an elevated risk of (recurrent) atherothrombotic events in patients with acute coronary syndromes.

A few observational studies reported a protective effect of factor V Leiden against bleeding in patients with hemophilia and patients with venous thromboembolism using oral anticoagulants, whereas results were inconsistent for blood loss related to cardiac surgery in patients with versus without factor V Leiden. A multinational registry of patients with established venous thromboembolism reported a 50% lower risk of major bleeding in carriers of factor V Leiden during treatment with oral anticoagulants. In contrast, atherothrombotic events are more prevalent and require lifelong antithrombotic drug use, usually in the form of single or dual antiplatelet agents, depending on the underlying phenotype and timing of interventions such as stent implantation. Guidelines recommend dual antiplatelet therapy.

### Inherited defects of coagulation factor V: the thrombotic side [^111ib1bh]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2006). Low credibility.

DNA variations in the Factor V gene have played a major role in thrombosis research ever since the discovery of Factor V Leiden. Here, all relatively common DNA variations in the coding regions of the Factor V gene are discussed. Many of them have been associated with venous thrombosis or related diseases. However, most variations have been studied separately, without taking the presence of other variations in the same gene into account. This means that their association with disease should be interpreted with caution, as it may reflect linkage with another variation.

An approach in which a haplotype-based analysis of the Factor V gene is combined with in vitro assays of recombinant proteins is advocated. Finally, a possible reason for the relatively polymorphic nature of the Factor V protein is discussed.

Leiden, prothrombin gene variant, and other genetic variants (except deficiency) and risk of thrombosis.

The FVL and F2 G20210A variants are the most commonly tested genetic variants predisposing to VTE. These are detected using polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based methods, and their prevalence varies in populations of different ethnicities. For example, heterozygosity for FVL is present in about 5% of individuals of European descent but is rare or absent in peoples from sub-Saharan Africa, East Asia, and indigenous populations of the Americas and Australia. Similarly, heterozygosity for the prothrombin gene variant is present in 1%-2% of Europeans and is rare or absent in other ethnic populations.

The FVL variant abolishes a cleavage site for activated PC in factor V, increasing procoagulant activity. The prothrombin gene variant is a point mutation (G20210A) in the 3′ untranslated region of the gene, causing increased levels of prothrombin. These variants result in increased relative risks for first venous thrombosis of 5- and 3-fold, respectively.

A large number of variants in other genes with a wide range of prevalences have been reported to confer an increased risk of thrombosis. These include variants of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR), SERPINE1 (encoding plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1) (PAI-1), and factor XIII, as well as variants linked to the quantitative changes in procoagulant factors discussed above. However, either their association with thrombosis is not convincingly consistent, or their effect is too small to alter management, and they should not be included.

### Pregnancy, thrombophilia, and the risk of a first venous thrombosis: Systematic review and Bayesian meta-analysis [^115JN2hG]. BMJ (2017). Low credibility.

For women with heterozygous factor V Leiden mutation, the absolute risk of pregnancy-associated venous thromboembolism (VTE) was 1.1% overall (95% credible interval 0.3% to 1.9%), 0.4% antepartum (0.1% to 0.9%), and 2.0% postpartum (0.9% to 3.7%). The absolute risk of pregnancy-associated VTE derived from family studies (2.4%) was higher than the risk derived from non-family studies (0.4%).

For women with homozygous factor V Leiden mutation, the absolute risk of pregnancy-associated VTE was 6.2% overall (95% credible interval 0.0% to 18.0%), 2.8% antepartum (0.0% to 8.6%), and 2.8% postpartum (0.0% to 8.8%). The absolute risk of pregnancy-associated VTE derived from family studies (8.3%, 95% credible interval 0.0% to 29.6%) was higher than the risk derived from non-family studies (5.6%, 0.0% to 34.3%).

For women with heterozygous prothrombin G20210A mutation, the absolute risk of pregnancy-associated VTE was 0.9% overall (95% credible interval 0.2% to 2.0%), 0.0% antepartum (0.0% to 0.2%), and 0.9% postpartum (0.2% to 2.0%). The absolute risk of pregnancy-associated VTE derived from family studies (1.0%) was higher than the risk derived from non-family studies (0.8%).

Notably, the one woman with homozygous prothrombin G20210A mutation in the cohort study that qualified for inclusion did not have a VTE event.

For women with combined heterozygous factor V Leiden and prothrombin G20210A mutations, further analysis is needed.

### Risk score to predict the outcome of patients with cerebral vein and dural sinus thrombosis [^114j7q5C]. Cerebrovascular Diseases (2009). High credibility.

The Risk Score for Cerebral Venous Thrombosis Outcome is a prognostic index that aids in predicting the likelihood of poor outcomes in patients diagnosed with cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT). This scoring system is particularly useful in stratifying patients based on their risk profile, thereby guiding clinicians in tailoring appropriate therapeutic interventions and follow-up strategies.

The primary components of this risk score include six variables, each assigned a specific point value. These variables are male gender, malignancy, coma, mental status disturbance, deep venous thrombosis, and intracranial hemorrhage. The total score is calculated by summing the points corresponding to each present variable, resulting in a score ranging from 0 to 9.

The risk of poor outcome is directly proportional to the total score. A score of 0 corresponds to a 3% risk of poor outcome, while a score of 1 increases the risk to 10%. The risk further escalates to 23% for a score of 2, 24% for a score of 3, and is equal to or greater than 47% for scores of 4 and above. This risk stratification allows clinicians to identify patients at higher risk of poor outcomes, facilitating early intervention and potentially improving patient prognosis.

### American Society of Hematology 2023 guidelines for management of venous thromboembolism: Thrombophilia testing [^112xF1tL]. Blood Advances (2023). High credibility.

For individuals with a family history of VTE and known antithrombin, protein C, or protein S deficiency (high-risk thrombophilia) who have a minor provoking risk factor for VTE, the ASH guideline panel suggests testing for the known familial thrombophilia. The panel suggests thromboprophylaxis in individuals with thrombophilia and no thromboprophylaxis in individuals without thrombophilia (conditional recommendation based on very low certainty in the evidence about effects ⊕○○○).

- **Remarks**:
	- A strategy with selective testing for the known familial thrombophilia type would mean that individuals with thrombophilia would receive thromboprophylaxis for a minor provoking risk factor, and individuals without thrombophilia would receive no thromboprophylaxis.
	- A positive family history is defined as having a first- or second-degree relative with VTE or thrombophilia.
	- These recommendations do not address homozygous defects or combinations of thrombophilia types.
	- This recommendation does not consider the time it takes to perform the test and is based on the assumption that thrombophilia test results are available at the time the individual is at risk for VTE because of a minor provoking risk factor.
	- These recommendations refer to selective testing for the known familial thrombophilia type. A separate question in this guideline addressed testing for all hereditary thrombophilias (using a panel of tests) in this population (recommendation 12), and the resulting recommendations are the same. It is most sensible to selectively test for the known familial thrombophilia.

### Coagulopathy and hemostasis management in patients undergoing liver transplantation: Defining a dynamic spectrum across phases of care [^11198UJt]. Liver Transplantation (2022). Low credibility.

Inherited prothrombotic disorders and the role of LT: Factor V Leiden, PT gene G20210A mutation, proteins C and S, and antithrombin deficiency are the inherited risk factors of VTE. Of these, Factor V Leiden and PT gene mutation are the most common. LT is the curative treatment for all of these inherited prothrombotic disorders, although they are never the sole indications for LT in these patients. Although rare, there are cases of prothrombotic disorders that can be transmitted by LT and warrant attention if correlated with clinical presentation.

Patients with preexisting thrombotic disorders requiring therapeutic anticoagulation prior to transplant should be able to discontinue anticoagulation. The timing and decision should be individualized with a careful discussion of risks and benefits.

### Risk of venous thrombosis in carriers of the prothrombin G20210A variant and factor V Leiden and their interaction with oral contraceptives [^111pSeYk]. Haematologica (2000). Low credibility.

The prothrombin G20210A mutation and factor V Leiden have been found to be associated with an increased risk of venous thrombosis, but the reported prevalences of the prothrombin gene variant, both in the normal population and in patients with deep venous thrombosis (DVT), vary greatly in the literature. Moreover, the influence of oral contraceptives (OC) on thrombotic events in patients with the prothrombin G20210A variant has not been well established. In this study, we evaluate both circumstances.

- **Design and methods**: A case-control study was conducted on 229 patients with DVT and 246 healthy controls. The patients' history of thrombosis and acquired thrombotic risk factors, especially OC, were recorded. Prothrombin G20210A mutation, factor V Leiden, antithrombin, heparin II cofactor, plasminogen, and proteins C and S were evaluated.

- **Results**: Seven and a half percent of the patients and 2.9% of the controls were carriers of the prothrombin mutation, while 12.2% of the patients and 1.6% of the controls had factor V Leiden. Among the 229 DVT patients, 130 had clinically suspected thrombophilia (first thrombotic event occurring before the age of 45 years or positive family history of thrombosis). Ten percent of these 130 patients were carriers of the prothrombin G20210A mutation, and 18.5% had the factor V Leiden mutation. The odds ratios (OR) for DVT risk were 2.4 (95% CI, 1.0–6.3) for the total DVT patients, and 5.2 (95% CI, 1.4–19.5) for patients with clinically suspected thrombophilia.

### A novel factor V mutation causes a normal activated protein C ratio despite the presence of a heterozygous F5 R506Q (factor V Leiden) mutation [^115yuVCr]. British Journal of Haematology (2013). Low credibility.

In this study, four cases with a "pseudo-wild-type" FVL, based on a novel detected polymorphism, were investigated. An adolescent, healthy female subject was advised by her physician to determine her F5 R506Q status before being prescribed hormonal contraceptives. She was a non-smoker with no personal or family history of any thromboembolic events. She was tested for both APC resistance and the F5 R506Q mutation. Because there was a discrepancy between the functional APC resistance testing and the genetic F5 R506Q testing results, her family was tested, and a pedigree was established. In the index subject, a heterozygous F5 R506Q mutation but a normal APC ratio were detected. The APC ratio was cross-checked using three different assays based on different FV activation pathways, which yielded consistent, normal results. When the F5 gene was sequenced in the index subject with the heterozygous F5 R506Q mutation, a novel heterozygous missense mutation 5326G > A (G1718S) in exon 16 of F5 was detected. This novel mutation (F5 G1718S) was registered as "factor V Graz" (FV Graz, GenBank accession number JF816043). Sequence analysis of F5 G1718S in the PolyPhen-2 databank yielded a "probably damaging" result (score 1.0). The FV activity (FV:Act) and the FV antigen (FV:Ag) levels of the index subject were significantly lower when compared to the mean values of the four non-FVL family members (65% vs. 125%, P = 0.023; and 43% vs. 103%, P = 0.008; respectively).

### Phenotypic heterogeneity in patients with homozygous prothrombin 20210AA genotype. A paper from the 2005 William Beaumont Hospital symposium on molecular pathology [^111QdeBT]. The Journal of Molecular Diagnostics (2006). Low credibility.

Venous thromboembolic events (VTEs) affect an estimated 1 in 1,000 people annually, resulting in approximately 50,000 deaths, with prevalence increasing with age. The genetic contributors to thrombosis have been described and further explored within the last 15 years as molecular diagnostic techniques have become more widely used. The prothrombin G20210A mutation is the second most common inherited thrombotic risk factor after factor V Leiden. Generally present in less than 5% of the population, the mutation's prevalence varies greatly with ethnicity. The G20210A mutation confers a mildly increased thrombotic risk that is compounded by the presence of other risk factors. One striking characteristic of the G20210A mutation is the phenotypic heterogeneity of the rare homozygous cases. Forty percent of the reported homozygous cases are asymptomatic. Many of the symptomatic patients have additional risk factors that might compound the thrombotic risk. We present here a review of the literature for the homozygous prothrombin G20210A mutation and describe additional cases that exemplify the heterogeneous nature of this entity.

- **Maternal comorbidity**: Cardiac disease, SLE, sickle cell disease, IBD, varicose veins.
- **Gestational comorbidity**: Gestational diabetes, preeclampsia, intrauterine growth restriction, placenta previa.
- **Delivery-related factors**: Preterm delivery, emergency C-section, peripartum or postpartum blood loss > 1 L, blood product replacement, stillbirth.

### Expression of the normal factor V allele modulates the APC resistance phenotype in heterozygous carriers of the factor V Leiden mutation [^116BSmEF]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2005). High credibility.

Functional defects of the protein C pathway, detectable in plasma as activated protein C (APC) resistance, are a prevalent risk factor for venous thrombosis. The factor V (FV) Leiden mutation causes APC resistance by interfering with the APC-mediated inactivation of both FVa and FVIIIa. Co-inheritance of FV Leiden and quantitative FV deficiency on different alleles, a rare condition known as pseudo-homozygous APC resistance, is associated with pronounced APC resistance and 50% reduced FV levels because of non-expression of the non-Leiden FV allele.

- **Objectives**: The role of normal FV in modulating the APC resistance phenotype in carriers of FV Leiden was investigated in patients with pseudo-homozygous APC resistance and in model systems.

- **Patients/Methods**: Four functional plasma assays probing both components of APC resistance (susceptibility of FVa to APC and cofactor activity of FV in FVIIIa inactivation) were employed to compare seven clinically and genetically characterized FV Leiden pseudo-homozygotes to 30 relatives with different FV genotypes (including 12 FV Leiden heterozygotes and seven carriers of FV deficiency) and to 32 unrelated FV Leiden homozygotes.

- **Results and conclusions**: All assays consistently indicated that FV Leiden pseudo-homozygotes are significantly more APC-resistant than heterozygotes and indistinguishable from homozygotes. Thrombin generation measurements in FV-deficient plasma reconstituted with purified normal FV and FV Leiden confirmed these observations and showed that the expression of the normal FV allele is an important modulator.

### Evidence gaps in the era of non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants [^112zc5WW]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Various hypercoagulable states, such as inherited coagulopathies, have limited data regarding the role of non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants (NOACs). These include conditions like homozygous factor V Leiden mutation, protein C or S deficiency, and elevated levels of factors VII–XII, or nephrotic syndrome. Individuals with these conditions were notably underrepresented in clinical trials.

A case involved a 21-year-old woman with recurrent venous thromboembolisms (reVTEs) due to protein C deficiency, complicated by warfarin-induced skin necrosis, and an inability to maintain anticoagulation on low molecular weight heparin (LMWH). She was prescribed dabigatran and did not experience any recurrence of VTE during a six-month follow-up.

Similarly, rivaroxaban was prescribed to a 30-year-old woman with homozygosity for the factor V Leiden mutation, which resulted in an ovarian vein thrombosis with proximal extension to the renal vein. This patient remained symptom-free without recurrence of thrombi or bleeding complications.

Dabigatran and rivaroxaban have also been used for secondary prophylaxis in a few patients with nephrotic syndrome, where anticoagulation is traditionally achieved with vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) or heparins.

### Hypercoagulability: Too many tests, too much conflicting data [^111VcMQh]. Hematology. American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2002). Low credibility.

It is now possible to identify hereditary and acquired risk factors in a substantial percentage of patients presenting with a venous thrombotic event. The clinician is faced with an ever-growing number of laboratory tests that can be ordered in such patients, and there is considerable uncertainty as to how this information should be utilized in patient management. Some have argued that the widespread testing of thrombosis patients for prothrombotic abnormalities, such as the factor V Leiden and prothrombin G20210A mutations, has been prematurely adopted into clinical practice because there are few data suggesting that their identification leads to improved clinical outcomes.

Dr. Rosendaal provides an overview of the epidemiology of venous thrombosis with an emphasis on hereditary and acquired risk factors. The presentation will include information obtained from properly designed case-control studies as well as family studies. While some have suggested treatment strategies for managing patients with hereditary thrombophilia with prior thrombotic events or for managing patients undergoing procedures associated with increased thrombotic risk, clinical decision-making is complicated by the need to assess the risk of recurrence and the likely benefit of prolonged anticoagulation versus the associated bleeding risk. Drs. Bauer, Heit, and Rosendaal discuss their approaches to patient management. Case presentations are used to illustrate the impact of laboratory test results on decisions.

### Management of hereditary hypercoagulable disorders [^1149vXVC]. Hematology. American Society of Hematology Education Program (2006). Low credibility.

The clinical management of individuals with hereditary hypercoagulable disorders has evolved from initial broad recommendations of lifelong anticoagulation after the first event of venous thromboembolism to a more intricate, individualized risk-benefit analysis. This change is due to studies that have begun to delineate the complexity of interactions between acquired and hereditary factors, which determine the predilection to thrombosis. The contribution of thrombophilic disorders to the risk of thrombotic complications, such as those associated with pregnancy, organ transplantation, and central venous catheter and dialysis access placement, has been increasingly recognized. The risk of thrombosis must be weighed against the risk of long-term anticoagulation in patients with venous thromboembolism. Thrombophilia screening in select populations may enhance outcomes.

These standards and guidelines are designed primarily as an educational resource for clinical laboratory geneticists to help them provide quality clinical laboratory genetic services. Adherence to this statement does not necessarily ensure a successful medical outcome. These guidelines should not be considered inclusive of all proper procedures and tests or exclusive of other procedures and tests that are reasonably directed to obtaining the same results. In determining the propriety of any specific procedure or test, the clinical molecular geneticist should apply their own professional judgment to the specific clinical circumstances presented by the individual patient or specimen. It may be prudent, however, to document in the laboratory record the rationale for any significant deviation from these standards and guidelines.

### Inherited risk factors for venous thrombosis [^11378xHm]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology Education Program (2005). Low credibility.

Venous thrombosis occurs as a consequence of genetic and environmental risk factors. Since the discovery of Factor V Leiden, the most common genetic risk factor, there has been intense interest in clarifying the roles of genes and the environment with thrombosis risk. The translation of this risk information to clinical practice is a challenging one in the setting of a rapidly expanding knowledge base that includes the application of genetic medicine. There are benefits, but also potential harms, associated with testing for inherited disorders related to thrombosis. This paper reviews inherited risk factors for thrombosis and discusses the clinical applications of testing.

### Impaired activated protein C response rates indicate a thrombophilic phenotype in inherited thrombophilia [^112VXHZX]. Haematologica (2022). Low credibility.

Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a multifactorial disease. Hereditary risk factors include common mutations such as factor V Leiden (FVL) and prothrombin (FII) 20210G > A, with a prevalence of 3–15% among whites, as well as deficiencies in coagulation inhibitors like antithrombin (AT), protein C (PC), and protein S. In recent studies, novel risk loci have been identified through genome-wide association studies. However, considering these loci in addition to classical thrombophilic defects results in an estimated heritability of VTE of only 15%, which contrasts with the 40–60% heritability observed in family-based studies.

To identify additional unknown genetic thrombophilic defects, it has been proposed to consider the laboratory phenotype of increased thrombin formation alongside the clinical phenotype of VTE. This proposition is based on observations of elevated in vitro thrombin generation parameters in families with unexplained thrombophilia and in carriers of genetic variations in hemostasis-related genes other than FVL and FII 20210G > A.

### Clinical and laboratory management of the prothrombin G20210A mutation [^115B6Jyi]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

To make recommendations regarding the appropriate evaluation for the prothrombin G20210A mutation, as reflected by published evidence and the consensus opinion of recognized experts in the field, data sources included a review of the medical literature primarily since 1996.

After an initial assessment of the literature, key points defining the condition and review of the clinical study design were identified. A draft manuscript was prepared and circulated to every participant in the College of American Pathologists Conference on Diagnostic Issues in Thrombophilia before the meeting. Each of the key points and associated recommendations were then presented for discussion at the conference. Recommendations were accepted if a consensus of 70% of experts attending the conference was reached. The results of the discussion were used to revise the manuscript into its final form.

Consensus was reached on several recommendations concerning the criteria for testing for the prothrombin G20210A mutation and the method of testing. First, a major point of consensus was that the prothrombin G20210A mutation is a significant risk factor for venous thromboembolism (VTE) and that testing should be considered in the initial evaluation of suspected inherited thrombophilia. Second, although several analytic methods are commonly used for genetic testing for the prothrombin mutation, all are generally robust and reliable. The recommendations for testing for the prothrombin mutation parallel those for the factor V Leiden mutation and include patients with a history of thrombosis or a family history of the disorder.
