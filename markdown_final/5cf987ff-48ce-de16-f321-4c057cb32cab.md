## Question

Rapid initiation of extended-release naltrexone in opioid use disorder

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about rapid initiation of extended-release naltrexone for opioid use disorder, including how it works, how it compares to standard approaches, its safety, and practical implementation guidance. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical problem and why rapid initiation matters. Then, I should verify the evidence base, especially the SWIFT stepped-wedge RCT. Next, I will compare the rapid protocol with standard care and quantify benefits and risks. After that, I should review safety signals and monitoring needs. Finally, I will align this with guidelines and outline practical, patient-centered implementation steps, including special populations and follow-up planning.

> Let me first confirm the clinical problem and why rapid initiation is important. Extended-release naltrexone is an opioid antagonist that requires patients to be opioid-free to avoid precipitated withdrawal; traditionally, that meant a 7–10 day opioid-free period after detoxification, which creates a long, vulnerable gap with high dropout and overdose risk, especially in fentanyl-dominant eras and inpatient settings where patients may lose momentum quickly [^84bfa25f] [^a29037a7].

> Wait, let me verify the core evidence. The pivotal SWIFT study was a 6-site, 70-week stepped-wedge cluster RCT of 415 adults with OUD comparing a rapid procedure (1 day buprenorphine, 1 opioid-free day, then ascending oral naltrexone with adjuncts over 3–4 days) versus standard care (3–5 day buprenorphine taper then 7–10 opioid-free days). The primary outcome was successful XR-naltrexone injection before discharge, and the rapid approach achieved 62.7% vs 35.8% with standard care, with an odds ratio of 3.60 and noninferiority met; importantly, withdrawal severity did not differ, though targeted safety events and SAEs were more frequent with the rapid approach, requiring closer monitoring [^6d1ca803] [^3d3b7f26] [^19c35217].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about superiority. I initially thought the rapid approach was statistically superior, but I should double-check the trial's framing. The authors concluded noninferiority with a large, clinically meaningful absolute improvement in initiation rates; while the magnitude favors rapid initiation, the formal superiority claim should be interpreted cautiously given the stepped-wedge design and confidence intervals, so I will keep the emphasis on the substantial increase in successful starts rather than asserting definitive superiority [^6d1ca803] [^3d3b7f26].

> Next, I should review safety and monitoring. The SWIFT trial reported more targeted safety events and SAEs with the rapid protocol, though absolute rates remained low; this aligns with the expectation that more intensive withdrawal management and preemptive adjuncts (clonidine, clonazepam, antiemetics) are needed, and that staff must be prepared to manage precipitated withdrawal risk and psychiatric symptoms that occurred more often in the rapid arm. Importantly, no new safety signals emerged beyond what is manageable with protocolized care and observation [^6d1ca803] [^3d3b7f26].

> I need to ensure this aligns with guidelines. ASAM 2020 recognizes XR-naltrexone as a recommended option for patients no longer physically dependent on opioids and explicitly calls for more research on rapid initiation protocols; the SWIFT results directly address that gap, though guidelines have not yet codified a specific rapid protocol as standard. Meanwhile, VA/DoD guidance supports offering XR-naltrexone when agonists are contraindicated or declined, acknowledging the initiation barrier and the need for careful patient selection and monitoring [^54fc3a5f] [^cff7a09c] [^9a01001a].

> Let me consider comparative context and retention. Historically, XR-naltrexone has lower initiation rates than buprenorphine in trials where randomization precedes detoxification (e.g., 72% vs 94% in X:BOT), but once initiated, relapse rates are similar; rapid initiation strategies like SWIFT narrow that initiation gap, and secondary analyses suggest that lowering thresholds for adjunctive medications during withdrawal further improves initiation probability, reinforcing the value of proactive symptom control rather than reactive dosing [^ced34f3d] [^42b92809].

> I should confirm practical implementation elements. The SWIFT rapid protocol includes: day 1 buprenorphine at the lowest effective dose, day 2 opioid-free with close monitoring, days 3–4 ascending oral naltrexone (e.g., 0.5 mg → 1 mg → 3 mg → 12.5 mg) with clonidine, clonazepam, and antiemetics as needed, then XR-naltrexone 380 mg IM on day 5; this compresses initiation to about 5 days total. Sites need trained nursing staff, standardized COWS monitoring, and a plan for precipitated withdrawal management, including escalation pathways and psychiatric observation given the higher observed psychiatric adverse events in the rapid arm [^6d1ca803] [^3d3b7f26].

> But wait, what about special populations and settings. In correctional or inpatient environments, rapid initiation is particularly compelling because patients are captive and motivated; however, in outpatient primary care or HIV clinic settings, initiation rates are lower without intensive supports, so models that pair inpatient induction with outpatient continuation may be necessary. Homelessness, parole/probation status, and pain severity at baseline have been identified as moderators of initiation success and relapse risk, suggesting that patient-treatment matching and wraparound services can optimize outcomes [^04004100] [^cc3d0b82].

> I should double-check the downstream implications for retention and overdose risk. While SWIFT did not show a significant difference in second injection receipt, the large increase in first-injection success is clinically meaningful because initiation is the biggest bottleneck; moreover, patients who discontinue XR-naltrexone lose opioid tolerance and face elevated overdose risk if they resume use, so counseling and naloxone distribution are essential at discharge and at any discontinuation [^6d1ca803] [^2a10df97].

> Let me synthesize a practical, risk-mitigated approach. For appropriate patients who prefer antagonist therapy or have contraindications to agonists, a rapid initiation protocol can be offered with informed consent emphasizing precipitated withdrawal risk, the need for close monitoring, and the requirement for robust linkage to outpatient care. Key steps include: confirm opioid use history and last use, screen for hepatic disease and contraindications, use the 1-day buprenorphine → 1 opioid-free day → oral naltrexone titration with adjuncts → XR-naltrexone 380 mg IM sequence, monitor vitals and COWS frequently, and ensure a 28-day follow-up plan with contingency for earlier dosing in rapid metabolizers or if breakthrough cravings emerge [^6d1ca803] [^38d3758c] [^54fc3a5f].

> In conclusion, I should confirm the bottom line. Rapid initiation of XR-naltrexone using a structured, 5-day protocol with preemptive adjuncts substantially increases successful initiation without worsening withdrawal severity, though it demands more intensive staffing and safety monitoring. This strategy is best suited to inpatient or highly supported settings and represents a meaningful advance in addressing the historical initiation barrier that has limited XR-naltrexone's real-world impact, while still requiring careful patient selection, counseling, and linkage to ongoing care to realize retention and safety benefits [^6d1ca803] [^3d3b7f26] [^54fc3a5f].

---

Rapid initiation of extended-release naltrexone (XR-NTX) is feasible and **increases initiation rates** compared with standard detoxification, but requires **careful monitoring** for precipitated withdrawal and adverse events. The SWIFT trial showed rapid initiation achieved 62.7% successful injection vs 35.8% with standard care, with no significant difference in withdrawal severity, but more safety events occurred and **staffing needs were higher** [^6d1ca803] [^3d3b7f26]. Rapid initiation is best suited to inpatient or highly supported settings, with protocols that include minimal buprenorphine, short opioid-free periods, and low-dose oral naltrexone titration with adjuncts (clonidine, benzodiazepines, antiemetics) [^6d1ca803] [^e49f0d26]. It is not recommended for outpatient or unsupervised settings due to precipitated withdrawal risk and the need for close monitoring [^notfound].

## Clinical evidence supporting rapid initiation

### SWIFT trial (2024)

- **Design**: Stepped-wedge cluster RCT in 6 inpatient units; 415 adults with OUD.
- **Interventions**: Rapid procedure (1 day buprenorphine, 1 opioid-free day, then ascending oral naltrexone with clonidine, clonazepam, antiemetics) vs standard procedure (3–5 day buprenorphine taper, 7–10 opioid-free days).
- **Primary outcome**: Successful XR-NTX injection before discharge; 62.7% vs 35.8% (OR 3.60, 95% CI 2.12–6.10) [^6d1ca803].
- **Withdrawal**: No significant difference in moderate-to-severe withdrawal days (OR 1.25, 95% CI 0.62–2.50) [^6d1ca803].
- **Safety**: More targeted safety events (5.3% vs 2.1%) and SAEs (6.7% vs 1.6%) in the rapid arm; most were psychiatric or injection-site reactions [^6d1ca803].

---

### Earlier outpatient trial (2017)

Earlier outpatient trial (2017) showed that **naltrexone-assisted detoxification** (7 days, including single-day buprenorphine and ascending oral naltrexone) achieved higher initiation than buprenorphine-assisted detoxification (56.1% vs 32.7%) and more second injections at week 5 (50.0% vs 26.9%) [^e49f0d26].

---

## Clinical protocols and safety considerations

### Key components of rapid initiation protocols

- **Minimal buprenorphine**: Single day at the lowest effective dose to mitigate withdrawal.
- **Short opioid-free period**: Typically 24 hours before oral naltrexone.
- **Low-dose oral naltrexone titration**: Gradual escalation over 3–4 days to reduce precipitated withdrawal risk.
- **Adjunctive medications**: Clonidine, benzodiazepines, antiemetics for symptom control [^6d1ca803] [^e49f0d26].
- **Close monitoring**: Frequent COWS assessments and clinical observation during induction [^6d1ca803].

---

### Safety considerations and risks

- **Precipitated withdrawal**: Risk is mitigated but not eliminated; requires vigilant monitoring and readiness to treat [^6d1ca803].
- **Psychiatric adverse events**: Higher incidence in rapid initiation; staff should be prepared to manage acute psychiatric symptoms [^6d1ca803].
- **Injection-site reactions**: Common but generally mild and self-limited [^a5a0c245].
- **Overdose risk after discontinuation**: Patients lose tolerance; counsel on overdose risk and provide naloxone [^2a10df97].

---

## Comparative effectiveness and retention

Retention appears similar between rapid and standard initiation in the SWIFT trial, with **no significant difference in second injection receipt** (31.7% vs 21.3%; adjusted difference 10.4%, 95% CI −2.36 to 23.16) [^6d1ca803]. Real-world data indicate that XR-NTX generally has lower retention than buprenorphine, though initiation rates improve with rapid protocols; retention remains a challenge and warrants ongoing support and linkage to care [^5e2f6941] [^d45d8838].

---

## Patient selection criteria

Rapid initiation is most appropriate for:

- **Inpatient settings**: Structured environment with 24/7 monitoring and experienced staff [^6d1ca803].
- **Highly motivated patients**: Willing to undergo closely supervised induction [^notfound].
- **Patients with contraindications to agonists**: Cannot take methadone or buprenorphine [^16d30024].
- **Patients declining agonists**: Prefer non-agonist treatment after informed consent [^16d30024].

---

## Limitations and challenges

- **Staffing and resources**: Requires trained personnel, frequent monitoring, and readiness to manage complications [^6d1ca803].
- **Not suitable for outpatient settings**: Risk of precipitated withdrawal and lack of supervision limit feasibility [^notfound].
- **Patient acceptance**: Some may prefer agonist treatments due to lower initiation burden [^ced34f3d].
- **Long-term retention**: Initiation gains may not translate into improved retention without robust psychosocial support [^d45d8838].

---

## Current clinical guidelines and expert consensus

Current guidelines acknowledge XR-NTX as a valid option but emphasize the **need for more research** on rapid initiation protocols [^cff7a09c]. ASAM notes that naltrexone-facilitated withdrawal shows promise but remains investigational outside specialized settings [^10903138]. VA/DoD suggests XR-NTX when agonists are contraindicated or declined, with careful attention to initiation barriers [^9a01001a].

---

## Practical recommendations for clinicians

- **Use in inpatient or highly supported settings**: Ensure close monitoring and rapid management of complications [^6d1ca803].
- **Follow established protocols**: Minimal buprenorphine, short opioid-free period, low-dose oral naltrexone titration, and adjunctive medications [^6d1ca803] [^e49f0d26].
- **Counsel on risks and benefits**: Discuss precipitated withdrawal, psychiatric risks, and overdose risk after discontinuation [^6d1ca803] [^2a10df97].
- **Provide robust linkage to care**: Combine with psychosocial support to improve retention and outcomes [^c136453c] [^d45d8838].

---

Rapid initiation of XR-NTX is a promising strategy to overcome the traditional detoxification barrier, **increasing initiation rates** without worsening withdrawal, but it requires **careful patient selection**, structured protocols, and close monitoring. It is best reserved for inpatient or highly supported settings, with ongoing care to sustain retention and safety.

Importance

Injectable extended-release (XR)-naltrexone is an effective treatment option for opioid use disorder (OUD), but the need to withdraw patients from opioid treatment prior to initiation is a barrier to implementation.

Objective

To compare the effectiveness of the standard procedure (SP) with the rapid procedure (RP) for XR-naltrexone initiation.

Design, Setting, and Participants

The Surmounting Withdrawal to Initiate Fast Treatment with Naltrexone study was an optimized stepped-wedge cluster randomized trial conducted at 6 community-based inpatient addiction treatment units. Units using the SP were randomly assigned at 14-week intervals to implement the RP. Participants admitted with OUD received the procedure the unit was delivering at the time of their admission. Participant recruitment took place between March 16, 2021, and July 18, 2022. The last visit was September 21, 2022.

Interventions

Standard procedure, based on the XR-naltrexone package insert (approximately 5-day buprenorphine taper followed by a 7- to 10-day opioid-free period and RP, defined as 1 day of buprenorphine at minimum necessary dose, 1 opioid-free day, and ascending low doses of oral naltrexone and adjunctive medications (eg, clonidine, clonazepam, antiemetics) for opioid withdrawal.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Receipt of XR-naltrexone injection prior to inpatient discharge (primary outcome). Secondary outcomes included opioid withdrawal scores and targeted safety events and serious adverse events. All analyses were intention-to-treat.

Results

A total of 415 participants with OUD were enrolled (mean [SD] age, 33.6 [8.48] years; 205 [49.4%] identified sex as male); 54 [13.0%] individuals identified as Black, 91 [21.9%] as Hispanic, 290 [69.9%] as White, and 22 [5.3%] as multiracial. Rates of successful initiation of XR-naltrexone among the RP group (141 of 225 [62.7%]) were noninferior to those of the SP group (68 of 190 [35.8%]) (odds ratio [OR], 3.60; 95% CI, 2.12–6.10). Withdrawal did not differ significantly between conditions (proportion of days with a moderate or greater maximum Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale score (> 12) for RP vs SP: OR, 1.25; 95% CI, 0.62–2.50). Targeted safety events (RP: 12 [5.3%]; SP: 4 [2.1%]) and serious adverse events (RP: 15 [6.7%]; SP: 3 [1.6%]) were infrequent but occurred more often with RP than SP.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this trial, the RP of XR-naltrexone initiation was noninferior to the standard approach and saved time, although it required more intensive medical management and safety monitoring. The results of this trial suggest that rapid initiation could make XR-naltrexone a more viable treatment for patients with OUD.

### Rapid initiation of injection naltrexone for opioid use disorder: a stepped-wedge cluster randomized clinical trial [^3d3b7f26]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Can the opioid antagonist injectable extended-release (XR)-naltrexone be started in patients with active opioid use disorder (OUD) with a rapid (5–7 days) procedure?

Findings

In a 6-site stepped wedge cluster randomized clinical trial that included 415 individuals with OUD, more patients successfully initiated XR-naltrexone using the rapid procedure (62.7%) compared with a standard (12–14 days) procedure (35.8%). The rapid procedure was shown to be both noninferior and superior, but had a higher number of safety events and serious adverse events and required more staff attention.

Meaning

The findings of this trial suggest that a rapid approach to withdrawal management should be considered for patients with OUD attempting to start treatment with XR-naltrexone, but more intensive staffing needs may be a barrier to implementation.

Introduction

The opioid epidemic continues to contribute to substantial morbidity and mortality, with more than 80 000 opioid overdose deaths in the US in 2022. Efficacious, Food and Drug Administration–approved medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) that promote abstinence and protect against overdose include the full opioid agonist methadone, the partial agonist buprenorphine, and the antagonist naltrexone in an injected extended-release (XR) formulation (XR-naltrexone). Extended-release naltrexone may be particularly relevant for marginalized populations that may have less-favorable attitudes toward agonist-based treatments.

A substantial barrier to use of XR-naltrexone is the need to withdraw patients from opioid treatment to avoid precipitated withdrawal. The XR-naltrexone (Vivitrol; Alkermes Inc) prescribing information recommends a 7- to 10-day opioid-free period before administering XR-naltrexone. Assuming a typical 3- to 5-day buprenorphine taper for withdrawal from opioid treatment, this commonly used protocol adds up to 10 to 15 days before administering XR-naltrexone. During this extended period, patients are vulnerable to residual opioid withdrawal, cravings, and dropping out of treatment with the subsequent risk of overdose and death.

Procedures have been developed to shorten XR-naltrexone initiation by limiting the use of opioid agonists and using nonopioid medications proactively to manage withdrawal symptoms, together with gradually titrating small doses of oral naltrexone. In an outpatient single-site trial, this rapid initiation method was superior to the standard approach on the proportion of patients successfully initiating XR-naltrexone.

Improving the rate of XR-naltrexone initiation using the rapid procedure (RP) in community-based treatment settings could be an important step to ensure more patients with OUD have the option of initiating XR-naltrexone, if this is their preferred medication treatment. The NIDA Clinical Trials Network CTN-0097 Surmounting Withdrawal to Initiate Fast Treatment with Naltrexone (SWIFT) trial was conducted to test the effectiveness of the rapid XR-naltrexone initiation procedure compared with usual care at community-based inpatient addiction treatment units.

### Rapid initiation of injection naltrexone for opioid use disorder: a stepped-wedge cluster randomized clinical trial [^19c35217]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Methods

The SWIFT trial was a 70-week, stepped-wedge, cluster-randomized design trialconducted at 6 geographically diverse, community inpatient addiction treatment programs in the US. Inpatient sites (American Society of Addiction Medicine level 3.7 or higher) were selected from across the National Institute of Drug Abuse (NIDA) clinical trials network and had a sufficient volume of inpatient admissions with OUD. At the start of the trial and at 14-week intervals, 1 site at a time was randomly assigned to switch from their standard procedure (SP), which followed the Vivitrol prescribing informationto initiate XR-naltrexone, to the RP; the sixth site continued their SP throughout the trial (Figure 1). Randomization was conducted centrally through the Emmes NIDA Data and Statistics Center. SWIFT was approved at all sites by Biomedical Research Alliance of New York, and informed consent was obtained from all participants; financial compensation was provided. Methodologic details of the study were published previouslyand are available in the Trial Protocol in Supplement 1. The reported findings follow the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials reporting guideline for randomized studies.

Figure 1.
Stepped-Wedge Design in Which Treatment Sites Switched From Standard Procedure for Initiation of Extended-Release (XR)-Naltrexone to the Rapid Procedure Over Successive 14-Week Steps

Participants received the initiation procedure (ie, SP or RP) that their program was assigned to at the time of their admission. After the inpatient stay, participants were referred for outpatient addiction treatment according to each site's SPs and were followed up for 8 outpatient weeks; the second and third XR-naltrexone injections were offered at weeks 4 and 8 after the first injection.

Participants

Participants were recruited sequentially from patients with OUD seeking inpatient treatment at study sites. Clinical staff met with patients and reviewed MOUD options using a shared decision-making tool (eAppendix 2 in Supplement 2). All participating sites were well versed in the use of agonist-based treatment and encouraged all forms of MOUD. Study participation was only offered to individuals who expressed interest in XR-naltrexone treatment. Participants completed study consent up to 4 days from admission. Eligibility criteria were broad, allowing individuals with stable comorbid psychiatric, medical, and other substance use disorders to enroll.

### Rapid initiation of injection naltrexone for opioid use disorder: a stepped-wedge cluster randomized clinical trial [^466fcc63]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

The study SWIFT was published by Matisyahu Shulman and colleagues in 2024 in the journal JAMA Netw Open. This study is related to the following diseases: Opioid use disorder. In the SWIFT study, the trial question was: what is the role of rapid initiation procedure of injectable naltrexone extended-release in patients with opioid use disorder? In the SWIFT study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the SWIFT study, the population was: 415 patients (210 female, 205 male). The inclusion criteria were patients admitted with opioid use disorder. The key exclusion criteria were disabling or terminal medical illness; severe untreated or inadequately treated mental disorder; maintenance treatment with methadone; presence of pain of sufficient severity to require ongoing pain management with opioids; incarceration; pregnancy. In the SWIFT study, the interventions were: n = 225 rapid initiation (oral buprenorphine on day 1, followed by one opioid-free day, then oral naltrexone titration plus adjunctive medications for 3–4 days) n = 190 standard procedure (oral buprenorphine taper for 3–5 days, followed by a opioid-free period of 7–10 days). In the SWIFT study, the primary outcome was: difference not exceeding non-inferiority margin in successful initiation of extended-release injectable naltrexone (62.7% vs. 35.8%; OR 3.6, 95% CI 2.12 to 6.1). In the SWIFT study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in second extended-release injectable naltrexone (31.7% vs. 21.3%; AD 10.4%, 95% CI -2.36 to 23.16). In the SWIFT study, the safety outcomes were: no significant differences in targeted safety events, serious adverse events. significant difference in acute psychiatric symptoms (3.6% vs. 0%). In the SWIFT study, the conclusion was: in patients admitted with opioid use disorder, rapid initiation was noninferior to standard procedure with respect to successful initiation of extended-release injectable naltrexone.

### The ASAM national practice guideline for the treatment of opioid use disorder: 2020 focused update [^8046572f]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Opioid use disorder pharmacotherapy — extended-release naltrexone comparative effectiveness and mortality signals — Evidence supports the efficacy of extended-release injectable naltrexone for relapse prevention compared to placebo control. A recent study comparing extended-release naltrexone to sublingual buprenorphine/naloxone found it was more difficult to initiate treatment with extended-release naltrexone resulting in a higher rate of early relapse among those randomized to extended-release naltrexone compared with those randomized to buprenorphine/naloxone, but for those who successfully initiated treatment, extended-release naltrexone and buprenorphine/naloxone were similarly effective and fatal overdose, non-fatal overdose, and other serious adverse events did not differ between treatment groups. A 12-week open-label randomized controlled trial found extended-release naltrexone was similar to buprenorphine/naloxone in maintaining short-term abstinence from illicit opioids following successful initiation. Further study is needed on the relative effectiveness of extended-release naltrexone in reducing mortality compared with methadone or buprenorphine, and a recent retrospective cohort study including data from more than 17,000 adults without cancer who survived an opioid overdose found decreased all-cause mortality and opioid-related mortality among patients treated with buprenorphine but could not draw any conclusions about the effect of naltrexone on mortality due to uncertainty in the estimates.

### Retention strategies for medications for opioid use disorder in adults: a rapid evidence review [^9b40109e]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives:

Although medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) save lives, treatment retention remains challenging. Identification of interventions to improve MOUD retention is of interest to policymakers and researchers. On behalf of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, we conducted a rapid evidence review on interventions to improve MOUD retention.

Methods:

We searched MEDLINE and the Cochrane Library from February 2009 through August 2019 for systematic reviews and randomized trials of care settings, services, logistical support, contingency management, health information technology (IT), extended-release (XR) formulations, and psychosocial interventions that assessed retention at least 3 months.

Results:

Two systematic reviews and 39 primary studies were included; most did not focus on retention as the primary outcome. Initiating MOUD in soon-to-be-released incarcerated people improved retention following release. Contingency management may improve retention using antagonist but not agonist MOUD. Retention with interventions integrating medical, psychiatric, social services, or IT did not differ from in-person treatment-as-usual approaches. Retention was comparable with XR- compared to daily buprenorphine formulations and conflicting with XR-naltrexone monthly injection compared to daily buprenorphine. Most psychosocial interventions did not improve retention.

Discussion:

Consistent but sparse evidence supports criminal justice prerelease MOUD initiation, and contingency management interventions for antagonist MOUD. Integrating MOUD with medical, psychiatric, social services, delivering through IT, or administering via XR-MOUD formulations did not worsen retention. Fewer than half of the studies we identified focused on retention as a primary outcome. Studies used different measures of retention, making it difficult to compare effectiveness. Additional inquiry into the causes of low retention would inform future interventions.

### Rapid vs standard induction to injectable extended-release buprenorphine: a randomized clinical trial [^8b81f941]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Is rapid induction (RI) for initiating extended-release buprenorphine as safe and effective as standard induction (SI) in individuals who inject opioids or use fentanyl?

Findings

In this multicenter, open-label randomized clinical trial with 729 participants, RI was well tolerated and had higher retention than SI at extended-release buprenorphine injection 2 overall and in fentanyl-positive participants. Administering the second extended-release buprenorphine injection 1 week after the first was well tolerated in both the RI arm and SI arm.

Meaning

These findings suggest support RI for extended-release buprenorphine induction in high-risk patients and demonstrate the feasibility of administering the first 2 doses at least 1 week apart.

### The ASAM national practice guideline for the treatment of opioid use disorder: 2020 focused update [^cff7a09c]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Areas for further research — naltrexone priorities are specified as follows: Further research is needed to test the relative effectiveness of extended-release injectable naltrexone as an antagonist treatment, including methadone and extended-release injectable buprenorphine, in terms of treatment retention, substance use outcomes, and mortality. Further research is needed on optimal withdrawal management and initiation protocols to initiate treatment with and minimize the risk of precipitated withdrawal. Further research is needed on outcomes related to administering extended-release injectable naltrexone every 3 weeks for individuals who metabolize naltrexone at higher rates. Further research is needed on how to determine the optimal length of treatment with naltrexone for individual patients, on the safety and efficacy of naltrexone for pregnant women, and to develop more effective strategies for improving adherence to extended-release injectable naltrexone.

### Extended-release injectable naltrexone for opioid use disorder: a systematic review [^1227ad43]. Addiction (2018). Low credibility.

Aims

To review systematically the published literature on extended-release naltrexone (XR-NTX, Vivitrol ®), marketed as a once-per-month injection product to treat opioid use disorder. We addressed the following questions: (1) how successful is induction on XR-NTX; (2) what are adherence rates to XR-NTX; and (3) does XR-NTX decrease opioid use? Factors associated with these outcomes as well as overdose rates were examined.

Methods

We searched PubMed and used Google Scholar for forward citation searches of peer-reviewed papers from January 2006 to June 2017. Studies that included individuals seeking treatment for opioid use disorder who were offered XR-NTX were included.

Results

We identified and included 34 studies. Pooled estimates showed that XR-NTX induction success was lower in studies that included individuals that required opioid detoxification [62.6%, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 54.5–70.0%] compared with studies that included individuals already detoxified from opioids (85.0%, 95% CI = 78.0–90.1%); 44.2% (95% CI = 33.1–55.9%) of individuals took all scheduled injections of XR-NTX, which were usually six or fewer. Adherence was higher in prospective investigational studies (i.e. studies conducted in a research context according to a study protocol) compared to retrospective studies of medical records taken from routine care (6-month rates: 46.7%, 95% CI = 34.5–59.2% versus 10.5%, 95% CI = 4.6–22.4%, respectively). Compared with referral to treatment, XR-NTX reduced opioid use in adults under criminal justice supervision and when administered to inmates before release. XR-NTX reduced opioid use compared with placebo in Russian adults, but this effect was confounded by differential retention between study groups. XR-NTX showed similar efficacy to buprenorphine when randomization occurred after detoxification, but was inferior to buprenorphine when randomization occurred prior to detoxification.

Conclusions

Many individuals intending to start extended-release naltrexone (XR-NTX) do not and most who do start XR-NTX discontinue treatment prematurely, two factors that limit its clinical utility significantly. XR-NTX appears to decrease opioid use but there are few experimental demonstrations of this effect.

### The ASAM national practice guideline for the treatment of opioid use disorder: 2020 focused update [^54fc3a5f]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Summary of recommendations — naltrexone for opioid use disorder: Extended-release injectable naltrexone is a recommended treatment for preventing relapse to opioid use disorder in patients who are no longer physically dependent on opioids, able to give informed consent, and have no contraindications for this treatment. Extended-release injectable naltrexone should generally be administered every 4 weeks by deep IM injection in the gluteal muscle at the dose of 380 mg per injection, and some patients, including those who metabolize naltrexone more rapidly, may benefit from dosing as frequently as every 3 weeks. Oral naltrexone is not recommended except under limited circumstances. Patients' psychosocial needs should be assessed, and patients should be offered or referred to psychosocial treatment based on their individual needs, in conjunction with extended-release naltrexone; a patient's decision to decline psychosocial treatment or the absence of available psychosocial treatment should not preclude or delay naltrexone treatment, and motivational interviewing or enhancement can be used to encourage engagement. There is no recommended length of treatment with naltrexone, duration depends on clinical judgment and the patient's individual circumstances, and because there is no physical dependence associated with naltrexone, it can be stopped abruptly without withdrawal symptoms.

Naltrexone — Further research is needed on optimal withdrawal management and initiation protocols to initiate treatment with naltrexone and minimize the risk of precipitated withdrawal. Further research is needed on outcomes related to administering extended-release injectable naltrexone every 3 weeks for individuals who metabolize naltrexone at higher rates. Further research is needed on how to determine the optimal length of treatment with naltrexone for individual patients. Further research is needed on the safety and efficacy of naltrexone for pregnant women. Further research is needed to develop more effective strategies for improving adherence to extended-release injectable naltrexone.

### Cost-effectiveness of buprenorphine-naloxone versus extended-release naltrexone to prevent opioid relapse [^c611c69e]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Not enough evidence exists to compare buprenorphine-naloxone with extended-release naltrexone for treating opioid use disorder.

Objective

To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of buprenorphine-naloxone versus extended-release naltrexone.

Design

Cost-effectiveness analysis alongside a previously reported randomized clinical trial of 570 adults in 8 U.S. inpatient or residential treatment programs.

Data Sources

Study instruments.

Target Population

Adults with opioid use disorder.

Time Horizon

24-week intervention with an additional 12 weeks of observation.

Perspective

Health care sector and societal.

Interventions

Buprenorphine-naloxone and extended-release naltrexone.

Outcome Measures

Incremental costs combined with incremental quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and incremental time abstinent from opioids.

Results Of Base-Case Analysis

Use of the health care sector perspective and a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100 000 per QALY showed buprenorphine-naloxone to be preferable to extended-release naltrexone in 97% of bootstrap replications at 24 weeks and in 85% at 36 weeks. Similar results were obtained with incremental time abstinent from opioids as an outcome and with use of the societal perspective.

Results Of Sensitivity Analysis

The base-case results were sensitive to the cost of the 2 treatments and the success of randomized treatment initiation.

Limitation

Relatively short follow-up for a chronic condition, substantial missing data, no information on patient out-of-pocket and social service costs.

Conclusion

Buprenorphine-naloxone is preferred to extended-release naltrexone as first-line treatment when both options are clinically appropriate and patients require detoxification before initiating extended-release naltrexone.

Naltrexone — indications, dosing, and formulation considerations: "Extended-release injectable naltrexone, administered every 3–4 weeks, is recommended for patients who are no longer physically dependent on opioids for preventing relapse in opioid use disorder". Naltrexone "is an opioid antagonist that blocks the effects of opioids" and "causes immediate withdrawal symptoms (precipitated withdrawal) in a person with active physical dependence on opioids". The text notes oral naltrexone often lacks effectiveness and "was not found to be superior to placebo or to no pharmacological treatments" for retention or illicit opioid use; "Oral naltrexone should only be used under limited circumstances", and "studies suggest that adherence to extended-release naltrexone is lower than that of buprenorphine".

Extended-release injectable naltrexone — indicated for prevention of relapse to opioid use disorder following complete opioid withdrawal — may be useful for patients with contraindications to buprenorphine or methadone, for whom those agonists are not successful, who might be motivated to taper off current agonist therapy, or who do not want to be treated with an agonist; in contrast, the Guideline Committee does not recommend the use of oral naltrexone except under very limited circumstances, such as highly compliant and motivated safety-sensitive workers with high monitoring, patients who wish to take an opioid receptor antagonist but cannot take extended-release naltrexone (e.g., need an opioid analgesic within the next month), and those who may benefit from medication to prevent return to illicit drug use but cannot or will not take extended-release naltrexone and do not wish to be treated with (or do not have access to) opioid agonists.

Buprenorphine treatment — transitioning between medications: Transitioning from buprenorphine to other opioid treatment medications may be appropriate when a patient experiences intolerable side effects, has not been successful in attaining or maintaining their treatment goals through the initially chosen pharmacotherapy, or wants to change and is a candidate for alternative treatment. Transitioning from buprenorphine to methadone does not typically result in any type of adverse reaction, and no time delay is required in transitioning a patient from buprenorphine to treatment with methadone. For naltrexone initiation, buprenorphine has a long half-life; 7–14 days should typically elapse between the last dose of buprenorphine and the start of naltrexone to ensure that the patient is not physically dependent on opioids, a naloxone challenge may be useful to demonstrate an absence of physical dependence, and investigators have begun to evaluate rapid transition methods using repeated very low naltrexone doses with ancillary medications over several days.

### Injectable, sustained-release naltrexone for the treatment of opioid dependence… [^a5a0c245]. JAMA Network (2006). Excellent credibility.

Safety of the treatment was evaluated based on reports of AEs, vital signs, liver function test results, clinical laboratory test results, and electrocardiographic findings. Only the treatment-emergent AEs were analyzed. Treatment-emergent AEs were defined as AEs that occurred after the first administration of study medication or previously occurring AEs that worsened after the start of study medication. The incidence of treatment-emergent AEs was summarized by treatment, body system, and severity. The incidence of treatment-emergent AEs that were considered to be possibly, probably, or definitely related to the study medication was summarized similarly. The AEs that resulted in study discontinuation were tabulated by treatment group and listed individually. The overall incidence of treatment-emergent AEs in each naltrexone group was compared with that of the placebo group using the Fisher exact test.

In the 384 mg of naltrexone group, 15 patients experienced an AE, 3 experienced a treatment-related AE, and none discontinued because of an AE. There were no significant differences among treatment groups in the number of AEs, treatment-related AEs, or discontinuations due to AEs. The most common treatment-related AEs were "general disorders and administration site conditions", where 2 AEs were reported in the placebo group, 6 were reported in the 192 mg of naltrexone group, and 3 were reported in the 384 mg of naltrexone group. Five patients who were discontinued from the study included 1 in the placebo group who experienced an injection site induration and 4 in the 192 mg of naltrexone group who experienced injection site redness, mass, and induration; a headache; and increases in liver function test results.

All of the injection site reactions were rated as moderate in severity and resolved spontaneously within 2 to 3 weeks. One potential concern with a long-lasting antagonist is that patients will attempt to override the blockade by using large amounts of heroin, thereby placing themselves at increased risk for overdose, especially during the period when naltrexone blood levels are decreasing.

Naltrexone initiation requires adequate opioid withdrawal to avoid precipitated withdrawal: before administering, the patient should be adequately withdrawn and no longer physically dependent; as a general rule, patients should be free from short-acting opioids for about 6 days and from long-acting opioids such as methadone and buprenorphine for 7–10 days; if uncertain, a naloxone challenge can be used in which naloxone hydrochloride 0.4 mg is administered and the patient is monitored for signs and symptoms of withdrawal, with a low-dose oral naltrexone challenge noted as an alternative.

### Retention strategies for medications for opioid use disorder in adults: a rapid evidence review [^d8e56462]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Two studies comparing XR-naltrexone monthly injection with daily buprenorphine/naloxone reported conflicting results. One good-quality Norwegian trial (n = 159) recruited patients from outpatient and inpatient settings, randomized them following completion of medically-supervised opioid withdrawal, and reported no difference in retention measured as mean days on study medication (mean [SD]: 69.3 [25.9] vs 63.7 [29.9] days, P = 0.33). Another multisite fair-quality US trial (n = 570) recruited patients from inpatient detox programs, randomized them before completing medically-supervised opioid withdrawal, and found lower retention rates in the XR-naltrexone group at 3 months (33.9% vs 40.0%, P = NR), in part due to decreased treatment initiation in the XR-NTX group.

All studies of XR versus daily MOUD formulations reported adverse events. One study (n = 60) reported 2 severe drug related adverse events (hives and increased anxiety and alcohol use) which resulted in removing two XR-naltrexone group participants from the study. Another trial (n = 570) of XR-naltrexone injection versus daily buprenorphine/naloxone reported a total of 28 elicit opioid-related overdose events among 23 participants. Eighteen overdoses (64%) were in the XR-naltrexone arm and included 8 participants who failed treatment induction and never received an injection. Five overdose events were fatal (2 in the XR-naltrexone group and three in the daily buprenorphine/naloxone group). None of the studies assessed whether the effectiveness of XR-MOUD formulations to improve retention varied by participant characteristics.

### Comparative effectiveness of extended-release naltrexone versus buprenorphine-naloxone for opioid relapse prevention (X: BOT): a multicentre, open-label, randomised controlled trial [^ced34f3d]. Lancet (2018). Excellent credibility.

Background

Extended-release naltrexone (XR-NTX), an opioid antagonist, and sublingual buprenorphine-naloxone (BUP-NX), a partial opioid agonist, are pharmacologically and conceptually distinct interventions to prevent opioid relapse. We aimed to estimate the difference in opioid relapse-free survival between XR-NTX and BUP-NX.

Methods

We initiated this 24 week, open-label, randomised controlled, comparative effectiveness trial at eight US community-based inpatient services and followed up participants as outpatients. Participants were 18 years or older, had Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-5 opioid use disorder, and had used non-prescribed opioids in the past 30 days. We stratified participants by treatment site and opioid use severity and used a web-based permuted block design with random equally weighted block sizes of four and six for randomisation (1:1) to receive XR-NTX or BUP-NX. XR-NTX was monthly intramuscular injections (Vivitrol; Alkermes) and BUP-NX was daily self-administered buprenorphine-naloxone sublingual film (Suboxone; Indivior). The primary outcome was opioid relapse-free survival during 24 weeks of outpatient treatment. Relapse was 4 consecutive weeks of any non-study opioid use by urine toxicology or self-report, or 7 consecutive days of self-reported use. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02032433.

Findings

Between Jan 30, 2014, and May 25, 2016, we randomly assigned 570 participants to receive XR-NTX (n = 283) or BUP-NX (n = 287). The last follow-up visit was Jan 31, 2017. As expected, XR-NTX had a substantial induction hurdle: fewer participants successfully initiated XR-NTX (204 [72%] of 283) than BUP-NX (270 [94%] of 287; p < 0·0001). Among all participants who were randomly assigned (intention-to-treat population, n = 570) 24 week relapse events were greater for XR-NTX (185 [65%] of 283) than for BUP-NX (163 [57%] of 287; hazard ratio [HR] 1·36, 95% CI 1·10–1·68), most or all of this difference accounted for by early relapse in nearly all (70 [89%] of 79) XR-NTX induction failures. Among participants successfully inducted (per-protocol population, n = 474), 24 week relapse events were similar across study groups (p = 0·44). Opioid-negative urine samples (p < 0·0001) and opioid-abstinent days (p < 0·0001) favoured BUP-NX compared with XR-NTX among the intention-to-treat population, but were similar across study groups among the per-protocol population. Self-reported opioid craving was initially less with XR-NTX than with BUP-NX (p = 0·0012), then converged by week 24 (p = 0·20). With the exception of mild-to-moderate XR-NTX injection site reactions, treatment-emergent adverse events including overdose did not differ between treatment groups. Five fatal overdoses occurred (two in the XR-NTX group and three in the BUP-NX group).

Interpretation

In this population it is more difficult to initiate patients to XR-NTX than BUP-NX, and this negatively affected overall relapse. However, once initiated, both medications were equally safe and effective. Future work should focus on facilitating induction to XR-NTX and on improving treatment retention for both medications.

### Guidelines for managing substance withdrawal in jails [^a1d1faa1]. BJA/NIC (2023). High credibility.

Opioid withdrawal and OUD — Treatment selection and initiation (O-6 to O-9) state that buprenorphine and methadone are first-line treatments for opioid withdrawal and OUD, and all patients at risk for opioid withdrawal should have rapid access to treatment with these medications; because opioid withdrawal management without ongoing OUD treatment increases the risk for overdose and overdose death, the appropriate clinical strategy is to prevent opioid withdrawal by initiating ongoing treatment for OUD with buprenorphine or methadone; naltrexone is not a treatment for opioid withdrawal, extended-release naltrexone is a treatment option for OUD in patients who are no longer physiologically dependent on opioids, and this medication will exacerbate withdrawal in patients who are dependent on opioids; initiation of medications should not be delayed in patients experiencing or at risk for opioid withdrawal, and completion of the full assessment is NOT required before initiating medication for opioid withdrawal or OUD.

### Thresholds for adjunctive medication usage and probability of initiating injectable naltrexone [^42b92809]. Addiction (2025). Medium credibility.

Aims

To estimate the effectiveness of different thresholds for administering opioid withdrawal medications (clonidine and clonazepam) on the probability of successfully initiating extended-release naltrexone (XR-NTX) among participants with opioid use disorder (OUD) during medically managed withdrawal.

Design

Secondary analysis of a multisite clinical trial comparing a rapid vs. standard approach for XR-NTX initiation, 2021–2022.

Setting

Six community inpatient addiction treatment units in the United States.

Participants

English-speaking adults seeking treatment for DSM-5 OUD and expressing interest in XR-NTX treatment (n = 415).

Measurements

We estimated the extent to which the following thresholds for adjunctive medication administration would affect the probability of initiating XR-NTX over time: 1) where adjunctive medications were given in response to at mild-to-moderate withdrawal symptoms or greater [Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale (COWS) score ≥ 5), 2) where adjunctive medications were given in response to minimal withdrawal symptoms or greater (COWS score ≥ 3) and 3) where adjunctive medications were given regardless of withdrawal symptoms. Using a longitudinal sequentially doubly robust estimator, we estimated the cumulative probability of XR-NTX initiation under each of these three treatment regimes while accounting for dropout and initiation of other medications as competing events.

Findings

The estimated probability of initiating XR-NTX by day 14 was 50.4% [95% confidence interval (CI) = 41.8–58.9) under the no-threshold regime, 43.9% (95% CI = 39.1–48.7) under the regime of waiting for minimal withdrawal symptoms and 38.5% (95% CI = 34.3–42.6) under the regime of waiting for mild-to-moderate withdrawal symptoms. Probability of XR-NTX initiation was a statistically significant 11.9 percentage points higher (95% CI = 3.6–20.2) under the no-threshold regime versus the mild-to-moderate threshold regime, and a non-statistically significant 6.4 percentage points (95% CI = -0.8 to 13.7) higher under the no-threshold regime versus the minimal threshold regime.

Conclusions

Providing clonidine and clonazepam daily during the first five days of medically managed opioid withdrawal appears to statistically significantly increase the likelihood of initiating extended-release naltrexone treatment compared with waiting for mild-to-moderate withdrawal symptoms to administer adjunctive medications. To improve initiation rates, providers may consider lowering the threshold at which they provide adjunctive medications, giving these medications preemptively or to manage even minimal withdrawal symptoms.

Naltrexone transition to methadone or buprenorphine — indications, process, and safety are outlined as follows: Transitioning from naltrexone to other opioid treatment medications may be appropriate when a patient experiences intolerable side effects, has not been successful in attaining or maintaining treatment goals through the initially chosen pharmacotherapy, or wants to change medications and is a candidate for alternative treatment. Transfer of medications should be planned, considered, and monitored, and transitioning from an antagonist such as naltrexone to a full agonist (methadone) or a partial agonist (buprenorphine) is generally less complicated because there is no physical dependence associated with antagonist treatment. Patients being transitioned from naltrexone to buprenorphine or methadone will not have physical dependence on opioids and thus the initial doses of methadone or buprenorphine should be low, with clinicians discussing potential sedation, impairment, and fatigue and carefully monitoring these symptoms during initiation and titration. Patients should not be transitioned until a significant amount of the naltrexone is no longer in their system, which varies but is typically about 1 day for oral naltrexone or 28 days for extended-release injectable naltrexone. Patients who discontinue naltrexone treatment should be made aware of the increased risks associated with opioid overdose, especially the increased risk of overdose death, and treatment alternatives including methadone and buprenorphine, as well as overdose prevention with naloxone, should be discussed.

### American Society of Addiction Medicine (ASAM) national practice guideline for the use of medications in the treatment of addiction involving opioid use [^47970a84]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Switching from methadone to another medication for the treatment of opioid use disorder may be appropriate if the patient experiences intolerable side effects or is not successful in attaining or maintaining treatment goals through the use of methadone.

Patients switching from methadone to buprenorphine in the treatment of opioid use disorder should be on low doses of methadone before switching medications. Patients on low doses of methadone (30–40 mg per day or less) generally tolerate transition to buprenorphine with minimal discomfort, whereas patients on higher doses of methadone may experience significant discomfort in switching medications.

Patients switching from methadone to oral naltrexone or extended-release injectable naltrexone must be completely withdrawn from methadone and other opioids, before they can receive naltrexone. This may take up to 14 days, and a naloxone challenge may be useful in determining the lack of physical dependence on opioids. The only exception would apply when an experienced clinician receives consent from the patient to embark on a plan of naltrexone-facilitated opioid withdrawal management.

Patients who discontinue agonist therapy with methadone or buprenorphine and then resume opioid use should be made aware of the risks associated with opioid overdose, and especially the increased risk of death.

Part 5: Buprenorphine

Opioid-dependent patients should wait until they are experiencing mild to moderate opioid withdrawal before taking the first dose of buprenorphine to reduce the risk of precipitated withdrawal.

Induction of buprenorphine should start with a dose of 2–4 mg. Dosages may be increased in increments of 2–4 mg.

Clinicians should observe patients in their offices during induction. Emerging research suggests, however, that many patients need "not" be observed and that home buprenorphine induction may be considered. Home-based induction is recommended only if the patient or prescribing physician is experienced with the use of buprenorphine. This is based on the consensus opinion of the Guideline Committee.

Once it has been established that the initial dose is well tolerated, the buprenorphine dose can be increased fairly rapidly to a dose that provides stable effects for 24 hours and is clinically effective. Buprenorphine doses after induction and titration should be, on average, at least 8 mg per day. The US FDA approves dosing to a limit of 24 mg per day, and there is limited evidence regarding the relative efficacy of higher doses. In addition, the use of higher doses may increase the risk of diversion.

### The ASAM national practice guideline for the treatment of opioid use disorder: 2020 focused update [^3bbf2eb1]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Medications in opioid withdrawal — strategy overview describes two main strategies: the provision of gradually tapering doses of opioid agonists, typically methadone or buprenorphine, and the use of alpha-2 adrenergic agonists (FDA-approved lofexidine, and off-label use of clonidine) with other non-narcotic medications to reduce withdrawal symptoms; both are superior to no treatment with respect to withdrawal severity and treatment completion. Methadone and buprenorphine are generally more effective in reducing the symptoms of opioid withdrawal, and in patients that are quite anxious about the symptoms of the abstinence syndrome, alpha-2 adrenergic agonists may be preferred. Evidence cited indicates methadone tapers or alpha-2 adrenergic agonists result in similar severity of withdrawal symptoms, buprenorphine may be more effective than alpha-2-adrenergic agonists in terms of withdrawal severity, duration, and treatment completion, managing withdrawal with alpha-2 adrenergic agonists may enable a more rapid initiation if treatment with naltrexone is planned, and buprenorphine and methadone appear to be similarly effective although data are limited.

### The ASAM national practice guideline for the treatment of opioid use disorder: 2020 focused update [^983b9a6a]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Part 3: Treating opioid withdrawal — core recommendations and dosing: Using methadone or buprenorphine for opioid withdrawal management is recommended over abrupt cessation of opioids, since abrupt cessation may lead to strong cravings and/or acute withdrawal syndrome placing patients at risk for relapse, overdose, and overdose death. Opioid withdrawal management (i.e. detoxification) on its own, without ongoing treatment for opioid use disorder, is not a treatment method for opioid use disorder and is not recommended; patients should be advised about relapse and safety risks, and ongoing maintenance medication, in combination with psychosocial treatment appropriate for the patient's needs, is the standard of care for treating opioid use disorder. Assessment of a patient undergoing opioid withdrawal management should include a thorough medical history and physical examination, focusing on signs and symptoms associated with opioid withdrawal. By regulation, opioid withdrawal management with methadone must be done in an opioid treatment program (OTP) or in an acute care setting (under limited circumstances); for patients withdrawing from short acting opioids, methadone doses should typically be 20–30 mg per day and the dose may be tapered off in approximately 6–10 days. Opioid withdrawal management with buprenorphine should not be initiated until there are objective signs of opioid withdrawal; once signs of withdrawal have been objectively confirmed, a dose sufficient to suppress withdrawal symptoms is given with an initial dose of 2–4 mg titrated up as needed to suppress withdrawal symptoms. Alpha-2 adrenergic agonists (e.g. FDA-approved lofexidine and off-label clonidine) are safe and effective for management of opioid withdrawal; however, methadone and buprenorphine are more effective in reducing symptoms, in retaining patients in withdrawal management, and in supporting completion of withdrawal management. Opioid withdrawal management using ultra-rapid opioid detoxification (UROD) is not recommended due to high risk for adverse events or death, and naltrexone-facilitated opioid withdrawal management can be safe and effective but should be used only by clinicians experienced with this clinical method, and in cases in which anesthesia or conscious sedation are not employed.

Naltrexone formulations — oral versus extended-release injectable — are contrasted: except under special circumstances, evidence does not support the use of oral naltrexone for preventing relapse, with a meta-analysis of 1,158 participants in 13 randomized trials finding no superiority to placebo or no medication for retention or preventing return to illicit opioid use; when oral naltrexone is used after a negative naloxone challenge, dosing can start at 25 mg and increase to 50 mg daily from day 2, and in those tolerating 50 mg daily a 3-day per week regimen of two 100-mg doses and one 150-mg dose (total weekly 350 mg) may be used with adherence closely monitored; extended-release injectable naltrexone should generally be administered every 4 weeks by deep intramuscular (IM) injection in the gluteal muscle at 380 mg per injection, with some patients benefiting from dosing as frequently as every 3 weeks.

### The ASAM national practice guideline for the treatment of opioid use disorder: 2020 focused update [^bcacf001]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

ASAM 2020 opioid withdrawal — summary of recommendations includes the following: Using methadone or buprenorphine for opioid withdrawal management is recommended over abrupt cessation of opioids, and abrupt cessation may lead to strong cravings and/or acute withdrawal syndrome with risks including relapse, overdose, and overdose death. Opioid withdrawal management (i.e. detoxification) on its own, without ongoing treatment for opioid use disorder, is not a treatment method and is not recommended; patients should be advised about the risk of relapse and other safety concerns, including increased risk of overdose and overdose death, and ongoing maintenance medication with psychosocial treatment is the standard of care. Assessment of a patient undergoing opioid withdrawal management should include a thorough medical history and physical examination focusing on signs and symptoms associated with opioid withdrawal. By regulation, methadone-based withdrawal management must be done in an OTP or an acute care setting; for patients withdrawing from short acting opioids the initial dose should typically be 20–30 mg per day and patients may be tapered off in approximately 6–10 days. Opioid withdrawal management with buprenorphine should not be initiated until there are objective signs of opioid withdrawal; once confirmed, a dose sufficient to suppress withdrawal symptoms is given (an initial dose of 2–4 mg of buprenorphine may be considered), and the dose is increased as needed. However, methadone and buprenorphine are more effective in reducing the symptoms of opioid withdrawal, in retaining patients in withdrawal management, and in supporting the completion of withdrawal management. Opioid withdrawal management using ultra-rapid opioid detoxification (UROD) is not recommended due to high risk for adverse events or death, and naltrexone-facilitated opioid withdrawal management can be safe and effective but should be used only by clinicians experienced with this clinical method, and in cases in which anesthesia or conscious sedation are not employed.

### HIV clinic-based extended-release naltrexone versus treatment as usual for people with HIV and opioid use disorder: a non-blinded, randomized non-inferiority trial [^3144f229]. Addiction (2022). Medium credibility.

Background and Aim

Opioid agonist medications for treatment of opioid use disorder (OUD) can improve human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) outcomes and reduce opioid use. We tested whether outpatient antagonist treatment with naltrexone could achieve similar results.

Design

Open-label, non-inferiority randomized trial.

Setting

Six US HIV primary care clinics.

Participants

A total of 114 participants with untreated HIV and OUD (62% male; 56% black, 12% Hispanic; positive for fentanyl (62%), other opioids (47%) and cocaine (60%) at baseline). Enrollment halted early due to slow recruitment.

Intervention

HIV clinic-based extended-release naltrexone (XR-NTX; n = 55) versus treatment as usual (TAU) with buprenorphine or methadone (TAU; n = 59).

Measurements

Treatment group differences were compared for the primary outcome of viral suppression (HIV RNA ≤ 200 copies/ml) at 24weeks and secondary outcomes included past 30-day use of opioids at 24weeks.

Findings

Fewer XR-NTX participants initiated medication compared with TAU participants (47 versus 73%). The primary outcome of viral suppression was comparable for XR-NTX (52.7%) and TAU (49.2%) [risk ratio (RR) = 1.064; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.748, 1.514] at 24weeks. Non-inferiority could not be demonstrated, as the lower confidence limit of the RR did not exceed the pre-specified margin of 0.75 in intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis. The main secondary outcome of past 30-day opioid use was comparable for XR-NTX versus TAU (11.7 versus 14.8days; mean difference = -3.1; 95% CI = -8.7, 1.1) in ITT analysis. Among those initiating medication, XR-NTX resulted in fewer days of opioid use compared with TAU in the past 30days (6.0 versus 13.6, mean difference = -7.6; 95% CI = -13.8, -0.2).

Conclusions

A randomized controlled trial found supportive, but not conclusive, evidence that human immunodeficiency virus clinic-based extended-release naltrexone is not inferior to treatment as usual for facilitating human immunodeficiency virus viral suppression. Participants who initiated extended-release naltrexone used fewer opioids than those who received treatment as usual.

### Retention strategies for medications for opioid use disorder in adults: a rapid evidence review [^d45d8838]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Opioid use disorder (OUD) is a national health crisis. In 2018, an average of 128 people in the US died each day of opioid overdose. There is clear evidence, including a recent report by the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM), that people with OUD who receive medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) are less likely to die from overdose, engage in less illicit opioid use, and experience improved quality of life. Three medications — methadone, buprenorphine, and naltrexone — are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of OUD. Although remission from opioid use may be most protective against overdose and morbidity, remission is not always achievable due to treatment gaps along the OUD cascade of care continuum (ie, diagnosis, engagement, initiation of MOUD, retention, and remission). Longer retention on MOUD is associated with improved mortality; however, retention rates are low and variable, with 30% to 50% reported in most settings. – Possible explanations for poor retention rates include barriers to treatment access, particularly in rural settingsor among vulnerable populations (eg, people who experience incarceration), stigma toward individuals with OUD and MOUD, fragmented care (eg, separate addiction treatment systems and medical or psychiatric care systems), cost of MOUD, and logistical challenges associated with MOUD prescribing (eg, frequent visits and diversion surveillance).

### The ASAM national practice guideline for the treatment of opioid use disorder: 2020 focused update [^f82f7316]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for opioid use disorder, more specifically with respect to naltrexone, ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend to plan and monitor transitioning from naltrexone to methadone or buprenorphine. Recognize that transitioning from an antagonist (naltrexone) to a full agonist (methadone) or a partial agonist (buprenorphine) is generally less complicated than transitioning from a full or partial agonist to an antagonist because there is no physical dependence associated with antagonist treatment and thus no possibility of precipitated withdrawal. Start methadone or buprenorphine with initial low doses as patients being transitioned from naltrexone to buprenorphine or methadone will not have a physical dependence on opioids. Do not make the transition until a significant amount of naltrexone is no longer in the patient's system, about 1 day for oral naltrexone or 28 days for extended-release injectable naltrexone.

### Rapid vs standard induction to injectable extended-release buprenorphine: a randomized clinical trial [^27aac3fb]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Importance

Standard induction (SI) using transmucosal buprenorphine-naloxone is challenging in individuals who inject opioids, use high doses of opioids, or use synthetic opioids (eg, fentanyl).

Objective

To compare the effectiveness and safety of rapid induction (RI; single 4-mg dose of buprenorphine-naloxone) vs SI (≥ 7 days of buprenorphine-naloxone) followed by extended-release buprenorphine injection.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This multicenter, open-label randomized clinical trial was conducted from October 26, 2021, to January 19, 2024, at 28 outpatient treatment centers in the US and Canada. Treatment-seeking participants with moderate or severe opioid use disorder who inject opioids, use high doses of opioids, or use fentanyl were studied.

Interventions

Participants were randomized 2:1 to RI or SI before 300-mg injection of extended-release buprenorphine.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary end point, retention rate difference at injection 2 (1 week after injection 1), was estimated by a bayesian approach. Posterior probability was estimated for noninferiority of RI to SI (RI-SI > -10%) and superiority (RI-SI > 0%). Adverse events (AEs), including investigator-assessed opioid withdrawal symptoms, were reported. Subgroup analyses compared participants with positive or negative fentanyl urine drug screen results.

Results

Analyses included 729 randomized participants (mean [SD] age, 40.7 [10.4] years; 406 [55.7%] male) who initiated transmucosal buprenorphine per protocol, including 474 in the RI arm and 255 in the SI arm. A total of 560 participants received extended-release buprenorphine injection 1 (409 [86.3%] in the RI arm and 151 [59.2%] in the SI arm), and 452 received injection 2 (314 [66.2%] in the RI arm and 138 [54.1%] in the SI arm). At injection 2, RI was noninferior with higher retention than SI (difference, 11.8%; 95% credible interval [CrI], 4.3%-19.0%; posterior probability greater than 0 was 99.9%). Similarly, among participants with a positive test result for fentanyl, the retention rate differential in favor of RI was 14.8% (95% CrI, 6.5%-23.7%; posterior probability greater than 0 was greater than 99.9%). AE incidence was not statistically different between RI and SI participants (202 [42.6%] vs 93 [35.5%]; difference, 6.1%; 95% CrI, -1.3% to 13.4%). Up to injection 2, most AEs were associated with opioid withdrawal.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this multicenter randomized clinical trial, RI had higher retention than SI overall and in patients who tested positive for fentanyl through extended-release buprenorphine injection 2. Administration of injection 2 after 1 week was well tolerated and minimized time below target therapeutic levels of 2 ng/mL or greater compared with injection after 1 month.

### Cost-effectiveness implications of increasing the efficiency of the extended-release naltrexone induction process for the treatment of opioid use disorder: a secondary analysis [^d75f62fc]. Addiction (2021). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

In a US randomized-effectiveness trial comparing extended-release naltrexone (XR-NTX) with buprenorphine-naloxone (BUP-NX) for the prevention of opioid relapse among participants recruited during inpatient detoxification (CTN-0051), the requirement to complete opioid detoxification prior to initiating XR-NTX resulted in lower rates of initiation of XR-NTX (72% XR-NTX versus 94% BUP-NX).

Design

This was a retrospective secondary analysis of CTN-0051 trial data, including follow-up data over 24–36 weeks.

Setting

Eight community-based, inpatient-detoxification and follow-up outpatient treatment facilities in the United States.

Participants

A total of 283 participants randomized to receive XR-NTX.

Measurements

Efficiency was estimated using a multivariable generalized structural equation model to explore simultaneous determinants of XR-NTX induction and induction duration (detoxification + residential days). Cost-effectiveness was estimated from the health-care sector perspective and included expected costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs).

Findings

Treatment site was the only modifiable factor that simultaneously increased the likelihood of XR-NTX induction and decreased induction duration. Incorporating the higher predicted probability of XR-NTX induction, and fewer predicted days of detoxification and subsequent residential treatment into the cost-effectiveness framework, reduced the incremental average 24-week total cost of XR-NTX treatment from $5317 more than that of BUP-NX (P = 0.01) to a non-statistically-significant difference of $1016 (P = 0.63). QALYs gained remained similar across arms.

Conclusion

Adopting an efficient model of extended-release naltrexone initiation could result in extended-release naltrexone and buprenorphine-naloxone being of comparable economic value from the health-care sector perspective over 24–36 weeks for patients seeking treatment for opioid use disorder at an inpatient detoxification facility.

### Potential uses of naltrexone in emergency department patients with opioid use disorder [^094dadf3]. Clinical Toxicology (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction: Despite widespread recognition of the opioid crisis, opioid overdose remains a common reason for Emergency Department (ED) utilization. Treatment for these patients after stabilization often involves the provision of information for outpatient treatment options. Ideally, an ED visit for overdose would present an opportunity to start treatment for opioid use disorder (OUD) immediately. Although widely recognized as effective, opioid agonist therapy with methadone and buprenorphine commonly referred to as "medication-assisted therapy" but more correctly as "medication for addiction treatment" (MAT), can be difficult to access even for motivated individuals due to shortages of prescribers and treatment programs. Moreover, opioid agonist therapy may not be appropriate for all patients, as many patients who present after overdose are not opioid dependent. More treatment options are required to successfully match patients with diverse needs to an optimal treatment plan in order to avoid relapse. Naltrexone, a long-acting opioid antagonist, available orally and as a monthly extended-release intramuscular injection, may represent another treatment option. Methods: We conducted a literature search of MEDLINE and PubMed. We aimed to capture references related to naltrexone and is use as MAT for OUD, as well as manuscripts that discussed naltrexone in comparison toother agents used for MAT, opioid detoxification, and naltrexone metabolism. Our initial search logic returned a total of 618 articles. Following individual evaluation for relevance, we selected 65 for in-depthreview. Manuscripts meeting criteria were examined for citations meriting further review, leading to the addition of 30 manuscripts Conclusions: Here, we review the pharmacology of naltrexone as it relates to OUD, its history of use, and highlight recent studies and new approaches for use of the drug as MAT including its potential initiation after ED visit for opioid overdose.

### Clinical policy: critical issues related to opioids in adult patients presenting to the emergency department [^d6630772]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Medication for addiction treatment in the emergency department (ED) uses Food and Drug Administration–approved medications with counseling and behavioral therapies to provide a whole-patient approach to substance use disorders, and for opioid use disorder (OUD) may involve methadone, buprenorphine, or extended-release naltrexone; many EDs have initiated this treatment with the typical goal of outpatient continuation, and programs have demonstrated better short-term improvement in treatment and illicit opioid use rates over referral only or brief intervention.

### Naltrexone: not just for opioids anymore [^84809625]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2016). Low credibility.

Naltrexone is a semi-synthetic opioid with competitive antagonist activity at mu opioid receptors. Its efficacy has been demonstrated in the treatment of alcohol and opioid dependence, but adherence to daily dosing has been recognized as a factor limiting long-term effectiveness. Recently, a long-acting injectable formulation of naltrexone has received FDA-approval for treating alcohol and opioid dependence. This article reviews the pharmacology of naltrexone, the current evidence supporting the use of extended-release naltrexone, and the clinical challenges in the induction of patients to this medication.

### The ASAM national practice guideline for the treatment of opioid use disorder: 2020 focused update [^b491415d]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

ASAM National Practice Guideline — buprenorphine dosing at initiation: The risk of precipitated withdrawal can be reduced by using a lower initial dose, with an initial dose of 2–4 mg and observation recommended; if 60–90 minutes have passed without withdrawal symptoms, additional dosing can be done in increments of 2–8 mg, and once the initial dose is well tolerated, the dose can be increased fairly rapidly to provide stable effects for 24 hours. One extended-release buprenorphine injection that received tentative FDA approval in December 2018 is indicated for initiation, stabilization and maintenance when administered as a once-weekly or once-monthly injection, and only a single prior dose of transmucosal buprenorphine is required prior to initiation; the committee recommends clinicians use these products as indicated and be mindful of further evidence as it becomes available.

### Managing acute pain in patients taking medication for opioid use disorder: a rapid review [^b01900f9]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Managing acute pain in patients with opioid use disorder (OUD) on medication (methadone, buprenorphine, or naltrexone) can be complicated by patients' higher baseline pain sensitivity and need for higher opioid doses to achieve pain relief. This review aims to evaluate the benefits and harms of acute pain management strategies for patients taking OUD medications and whether strategies vary by OUD medication type or cause of acute pain.

Methods

We systematically searched multiple bibliographic sources until April 2020. One reviewer used prespecified criteria to assess articles for inclusion, extract data, rate study quality, and grade our confidence in the body of evidence, all with second reviewer checking.

Results

We identified 12 observational studies-3 with control groups and 9 without. Two of the studies with control groups suggest that continuing buprenorphine and methadone in OUD patients after surgery may reduce the need for additional opioids and that ineffective pain management in patients taking methadone can result in disengagement in care. A third controlled study found that patients taking OUD medications may need higher doses of additional opioids for pain control, but provided insufficient detail to apply results to clinic practice. The only case study examining naltrexone reported that postoperative pain was managed using tramadol. We have low confidence in these findings as no studies directly addressed our question by comparing pain management strategies and few provided adequate descriptions of the dosage, timing, or rationale for clinical decisions.

Discussion

We lack rigorous evidence on acute pain management in patients taking medication for OUD; however, evidence supports the practice of continuing methadone or buprenorphine for most patients during acute pain episodes. Well-described, prospective studies of adjuvant pain management strategies when OUD medications are continued would add to the existing literature base. Studies on nonopioid treatments are also needed for patients taking naltrexone.

### Rapid vs standard induction to injectable extended-release buprenorphine: a randomized clinical trial [^0eea41ed]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Highly potent synthetic opioids (eg, fentanyl and fentanyl analogues) are the leading cause of fatal overdoses in the US, accounting for more than 50 000 deaths in preliminary data for 2024. Despite this trend, clinical trial data are lacking to inform evidence-based treatment approaches that address the challenges of initiating and retaining patients using fentanyl receiving buprenorphine treatment.

SUBLOCADE (extended-release buprenorphine; RBP-6000) was the first once-monthly subcutaneous buprenorphine injection approved in the US and Canada for the treatment of moderate to severe opioid use disorder (OUD), and is approved in other countries. Extended-release buprenorphine significantly improves percentage opioid abstinence, treatment retention, and health-related quality of life compared with placebo. Long-term treatment (up to 18 months) is well tolerated and sustains improvements in opioid abstinence. Extended-release buprenorphine was initially indicated for patients who initiated treatment with a buprenorphine-containing product (eg, transmucosal buprenorphine-naloxone) followed by dose adjustments for a minimum of 7 days (standard induction [SI]). However, reports of precipitated opioid withdrawal symptoms during buprenorphine induction highlighted an important clinical challenge limiting treatment retention for patients using fentanyl.,

A pilot study demonstrated that initiating extended-release buprenorphine treatment after a single 4-mg transmucosal buprenorphinedose (rapid induction [RI]) was well tolerated, suggesting that extended-release buprenorphine can be safely initiated without a 7-day or longer period of transmucosal buprenorphinedose adjustments. Buprenorphine limits withdrawal symptoms and reduces overdose risk. This RI strategy would be particularly beneficial in settings requiring therapeutic buprenorphine levels of 2 ng/mL or greater to be rapidly achieved and sustained.

To compare the safety and effectiveness of RI and SI onto extended-release buprenorphine in patients with high-risk opioid use, including fentanyl, we conducted an open-label randomized clinical trial nested within a long-term maintenance dosing study. The current analysis focuses on induction study results. Although numerous reports, describe alternative induction strategies, this is the first completed multicenter randomized clinical trial, to our knowledge, directly comparing an alternative induction strategy with SI.

### The ASAM national practice guideline for the treatment of opioid use disorder: 2020 focused update [^a0afa03a]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Naltrexone (Part 6) — extended-release injectable naltrexone is a recommended treatment for preventing relapse to opioid use disorder in patients who are no longer physically dependent on opioids, able to give informed consent, and have no contraindications. It should generally be administered every 4 weeks by deep IM injection in the gluteal muscle at the set dosage of 380 mg per injection, and some patients may benefit from dosing as frequently as every 3 weeks. Oral naltrexone is not recommended except under limited circumstances. There is no recommended length of treatment with naltrexone; because there is no physical dependence associated with naltrexone, it can be stopped abruptly without withdrawal symptoms. Transitioning from naltrexone to methadone or buprenorphine should be planned, considered, and monitored; initial methadone or buprenorphine doses should be low, and transition should not occur until a significant amount of naltrexone is no longer in the system, about 1 day for oral naltrexone or 28 days for extended-release injectable naltrexone. Patients' psychosocial needs should be assessed and patients should be offered or referred to psychosocial treatment in conjunction with extended-release naltrexone, and a patient's decision to decline psychosocial treatment or the absence of available psychosocial treatment should not preclude or delay naltrexone treatment; motivational interviewing or enhancement can be used to encourage engagement. Patients who discontinue naltrexone should be made aware of the increased risks associated with opioid overdose, especially the increased risk of overdose death, if they return to illicit opioid use; treatment alternatives including methadone, buprenorphine, and overdose prevention with naloxone should be discussed.

### Effectiveness of injectable extended-release naltrexone vs daily buprenorphine-naloxone for opioid dependence: a randomized clinical noninferiority trial [^70a9ce13]. JAMA Psychiatry (2017). Medium credibility.

Importance

To date, extended-release naltrexone hydrochloride has not previously been compared directly with opioid medication treatment (OMT), currently the most commonly prescribed treatment for opioid dependence.

Objective

To determine whether treatment with extended-release naltrexone will be as effective as daily buprenorphine hydrochloride with naloxone hydrochloride in maintaining abstinence from heroin and other illicit substances in newly detoxified individuals.

Design, Setting and Participants

A 12-week, multicenter, outpatient, open-label randomized clinical trial was conducted at 5 urban addiction clinics in Norway between November 1, 2012, and December 23, 2015; the last follow-up was performed on October 23, 2015. A total of 232 adult opioid-dependent (per DSM-IV criteria) individuals were recruited from outpatient addiction clinics and detoxification units and assessed for eligibility. Intention-to-treat analyses of efficacy end points were performed with all randomized participants.

Interventions

Randomization to either daily oral flexible dose buprenorphine-naloxone, 4 to 24 mg/d, or extended-release naltrexone hydrochloride, 380 mg, administered intramuscularly every fourth week for 12 weeks.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Primary end points (protocol) were the randomized clinical trial completion rate, the proportion of opioid-negative urine drug tests, and number of days of use of heroin and other illicit opioids. Secondary end points included number of days of use of other illicit substances. Safety was assessed by adverse event reporting.

Results

Of 159 participants, mean (SD) age was 36 (8.6) years and 44 (27.7%) were women. Eighty individuals were randomized to extended-release naltrexone and 79 to buprenorphine-naloxone; 105 (66.0%) completed the trial. Retention in the extended-release naltrexone group was noninferior to the buprenorphine-naloxone group (difference, -0.1; with 95% CI, -0.2 to 0.1; P = 0.04), with mean (SD) time of 69.3 (25.9) and 63.7 (29.9) days, correspondingly (P = 0.33, log-rank test). Treatment with extended-release naltrexone showed noninferiority to buprenorphine-naloxone on group proportion of total number of opioid-negative urine drug tests (mean [SD], 0.9 [0.3] and 0.8 [0.4], respectively, difference, 0.1 with 95% CI, -0.04 to 0.2; P < .001) and use of heroin (mean difference, -3.2 with 95% CI, -4.9 to -1.5; P < .001) and other illicit opioids (mean difference, -2.7 with 95% CI, -4.6 to -0.9; P < .001). Superiority analysis showed significantly lower use of heroin and other illicit opioids in the extended-release naltrexone group. No significant differences were found between the treatment groups regarding most other illicit substance use.

Conclusions and Relevance

Extended-release naltrexone was as effective as buprenorphine-naloxone in maintaining short-term abstinence from heroin and other illicit substances and should be considered as a treatment option for opioid-dependent individuals.

Regarding medical management for opioid use disorder, more specifically with respect to naltrexone, ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend to do not use oral naltrexone for the treatment of OUD, except under very limited circumstances because of poor medication adherence. Reserve its use for patients able to comply with special techniques to enhance their adherence, for example, observed dosing. Recognize that extended-release injectable naltrexone reduces but does not eliminate issues with medication adherence.

### Rapid vs standard induction to injectable extended-release buprenorphine: a randomized clinical trial [^6563d07d]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Discussion

To our knowledge, this is the only large, completed, multicenter, randomized clinical trial to compare 2 buprenorphine induction strategies onto extended-release buprenorphine. In participants with high-risk opioid use, these findings demonstrate that RI onto extended-release buprenorphine is well tolerated and had higher retention than SI at the second injection (primary end point; 312 [66.4%] vs 138 [54.5%]; difference, 11.8%). Similarly, RI had higher retention than SI in more difficult-to-treat fentanyl-positive participants (difference, 14.8%). RI did not increase the frequency or severity of AEs. These data add to the evolving published evidence supporting effectiveness and safety of single-day buprenorphine initiation, with or without fentanyl use, and are consistent with other instances in which only a single transmucosal buprenorphine dose is administered prior to initiation of an extended-release buprenorphine product.

Buprenorphine induction is the first step to stable buprenorphine maintenance. The ultimate goal of RI is to reach a therapeutic buprenorphine concentration as soon as possible to manage OUD without inducing precipitated withdrawal that could jeopardize continued engagement in extended-release buprenorphine treatment. This study shows that RI with same-day administration of extended-release buprenorphine increases the number of individuals who complete induction and receive injections 2 and 3. It also supports safe administration of the second injection at least 1 week after the first. By receiving the second extended-release buprenorphine injection earlier, patients minimized the time below target plasma buprenorphine levels (≥ 2 ng/mL), which helps to control symptoms of craving and withdrawal.

Many participants in this study reported long-term opioid (including fentanyl) use, daily use, polysubstance abuse, and prior failed attempts at opioid withdrawal or maintenance treatment with buprenorphine or other medications for OUD. Fentanyl use was a particularly strong risk factor for early withdrawal symptoms and discontinuation during buprenorphine therapy initiation. Poorer outcomes associated with fentanyl use were particularly apparent in the SI treatment arm. Despite differences in timing of visits and injection, treatment retention in the fentanyl-negative SI subpopulation in this study appears broadly consistent with expectations from the original phase 3 study conducted before widespread fentanyl availability, which reported induction (run-in) failure in 161 of 665 participants (24.2%). In contrast, the high induction failure rate 94 of 196 (48%) in the fentanyl-positive SI subpopulation supports reports of more difficult buprenorphine induction in the current fentanyl-dominated era.

The proportion of participants with successful outpatient induction on XR‐NTX was lower than that reported in previous trials in which induction occurred in more controlled environments or where eligibility criteria excluded people with active opioid use at the time of enrollment. In one trial demonstrating efficacy of XR‐NTX for community‐dwelling, criminal justice‐involved adults with OUD, participants were required to be seeking non‐opioid agonist treatment and be opioid‐free on UDS prior to randomization; 95% successfully completed outpatient XR‐NTX induction. In another trial, 100% of incarcerated people with OUD who had abstained from opioids received their first XR‐NTX injection in the week prior to release. In a large comparative effectiveness trial of XR‐NTX versus buprenorphine for treatment of OUD, participants were recruited from inpatient medically supervised withdrawal facilities and initiated treatment in the inpatient setting — treatment initiation was 72% for XR‐NTX and 94% for sublingual buprenorphine. These studies suggest that a controlled setting for XR‐NTX induction is important. Engaging non‐treatment‐seeking patients with untreated OUD through community‐based outreach for XR‐NTX treatment in a less controlled, real‐life outpatient primary care setting probably requires more intensive supports for XR‐NTX induction. For example, qualitative interviews with clinical staff involved in the CHOICES trial identified limited access to inpatient facilities for medically managed opioid withdrawal as a barrier to XR‐NTX induction. Treatment models where patients interested in opioid antagonist treatment receive their first dose of XR‐NTX in an inpatient withdrawal setting followed by linkage to primary care for subsequent doses may increase the feasibility of XR‐NTX in primary care.

### Extended-release injection vs sublingual buprenorphine for opioid use disorder with fentanyl use: a post hoc analysis of a randomized clinical trial [^18d8a864]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

The rise in availability of fentanyl and fentanyl analogues has been implicated in the rapid increase in overdose fatalities over the past decade. Because of its potency (30–50 times more potent than heroin), rapid distribution, lipophilicity, and propensity to induce muscle rigidity, fentanyl is more likely to cause an overdose than other opioids, including heroin. People who use illicit drugs often lack awareness that fentanyl is present in the drugs they buy, which further increases overdose risk. Fentanyl is not detected by immunoassay urine drug testing typically used as first-line point-of-care screening.

Buprenorphine, a partial μ-opioid receptor agonist with high binding affinity and slow dissociation from the μ-opioid receptor, is well established as an effective treatment for opioid use disorder (OUD). However, data are limited on the effectiveness of buprenorphine or other medications (eg, methadone and extended-release injection naltrexone) for treatment of OUD when the patient is using fentanyl. A retrospective cohort study of patients initiating office-based buprenorphine treatment showed that patients with baseline fentanyl use demonstrated 6-month abstinence and treatment retention rates comparable with patients with baseline heroin use.

We report findings on buprenorphine treatment of fentanyl use from a previously reported phase 3 trial in which patients with OUD (N = 428), including a substantial subgroup (123 [28.7%]) with fentanyl or norfentanyl detected in urine at baseline, were randomly assigned to treatment with sublingual buprenorphine-naloxone or a formulation of weekly and monthly injections of extended-release subcutaneous buprenorphine, previously known as CAM2038 and granted US Food and Drug Administration approval in 2023. Levels of fentanyl and its metabolite norfentanyl were measured in urine throughout the study.

Co-occurring psychiatric disorders and antagonist treatment — psychiatrically stable patients are candidates for treatment with extended-release injectable naltrexone; there are little data regarding the relative efficacy of naltrexone in opioid-dependent patients with co-occurring psychiatric disorders; the once-monthly injections of extended-release injectable naltrexone may be useful in patients who may not be able to adhere well to daily oral dosing; patients should be closely observed for adverse events as some have reported suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, and depression.

### Sublingual buprenorphine-naloxone compared with injection naltrexone for opioid use disorder: potential utility of patient characteristics in guiding choice of treatment [^cc3d0b82]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

Sublingual buprenorphine-naloxone and extended-release injection naltrexone are effective treatments, with distinct mechanisms, for opioid use disorder. The authors examined whether patients' demographic and clinical characteristics were associated with better response to one medication or the other.

Methods

In a multisite 24-week randomized comparative-effectiveness trial of assignment to buprenorphine-naloxone (N = 287) compared with extended-release naltrexone (N = 283) comprising inpatients planning to initiate medication treatment for opioid use disorder, 50 demographic and clinical characteristics were examined as moderators of the effect of medication assignment on relapse to regular opioid use and failure to initiate medication. Moderator-by-medication interactions were estimated using logistic regression with correction for multiple testing.

Results

In the intent-to-treat sample, patients who reported being homeless had a lower relapse rate if they were assigned to receive extended-release naltrexone (51.6%) compared with buprenorphine-naloxone (70.4%) (odds ratio = 0.45, 95% CI = 0.22, 0.90); patients who were not homeless had a higher relapse rate if they were assigned to extended-release naltrexone (70.9%) compared with buprenorphine-naloxone (53.1%) (odds ratio = 2.15, 95% CI = 1.44, 3.21). In the subsample of patients who initiated medication, the interaction was not significant, with a similar pattern of lower relapse with extended-release naltrexone (41.4%) compared with buprenorphine (68.6%) among homeless patients (odds ratio = 0.32, 95% CI = 0.15, 0.68) but less difference among those not homeless (extended-release naltrexone, 57.2%; buprenorphine, 52.0%; odds ratio = 1.24, 95% CI = 0.80, 1.90). For failure to initiate medication, moderators were stated preference for medication (failure was less likely if the patient was assigned to the medication preferred), parole and probation status (fewer failures with extended-release naltrexone for those on parole or probation), and presence of pain and timing of randomization (more failure with extended-release naltrexone for patients endorsing moderate to severe pain and randomized early while still undergoing medically managed withdrawal).

Conclusions

Among patients with opioid use disorder admitted to inpatient treatment, homelessness, parole and probation status, medication preference, and factors likely to influence tolerability of medication initiation may be important in matching patients to buprenorphine or extended-release naltrexone.

CONSORT diagram

TABLE 1
Participant characteristics by treatment arm, n = 114 CHOICES participants

Overall, 69 of 114 (61%) participants received at least one dose of assigned study medication, including 26 of 55 XR‐NTX participants (47%) and 43 of 59 TAU participants (73%). Among XR‐NTX participants who received at least one injection, the mean number of injections was 3.3 (SD = 2.1, median = 3) and seven participants received all six possible injections (27% of those with at least one). Among TAU participants, 37 of 43 (86%) initiated buprenorphine, three of 43 (7%) initiated methadone and three of 43 (7%) initiated oral naltrexone. Among TAU participants receiving at least one dose of buprenorphine or methadone, the mean number of months was 2.9 (SD = 1.7). Five of 43 (12%) TAU participants received opioid agonist treatment for all 6 months. Excluding 10 participants who only received one prescription (and thus probably never received more than an induction dose), the mean daily dose of buprenorphine was 14.6 mg. The mean daily dose of methadone was 73.3 mg. Of the 92 of 114 participants (81%) who received ART during the study, 84 (91%) received an integrase‐inhibitor‐based regimen, typically as a single daily pill. Receipt of ART was not correlated with initiation of MOUD (83% of those initiating MOUD also started ART versus 78% not initiating MOUD, P = 0.5).

Table 2 and Figure 2 present the results of the primary study analyses. Of 114 randomized participants, 83.3% had HIV viral load collected at week 24, including 48 of 59 TAU participants (81.4%) and 47 of 55 XR‐NTX participants (85.5%). With missing viral load data treated as unsuppressed, 29 of 55 participants (52.7%) in the XR‐NTX arm and 29 of 59 participants (49.2%) in the TAU arm achieved HIV viral suppression at 24 weeks (RR = 1.064; 95% CI = 0.748, 1.514). As the lower confidence limit of the RR of 0.748 did not exceed the pre‐specified non‐inferiority margin of 0.754, we were unable to conclude that XR‐NTX was non‐inferior to TAU for achieving viral suppression.

### The ASAM national practice guideline for the treatment of opioid use disorder: 2020 focused update [^04ef240b]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

ASAM National Practice Guideline — naltrexone and perioperative pain management — Oral naltrexone should be discontinued at least 72 hours before elective surgery and extended-release naltrexone should be stopped at least 30 days before surgery, with oral naltrexone allowed temporarily until 72 hours prior; patients should be off opioids for 3–7 days before resuming naltrexone. Patients on naltrexone may not respond to opioid analgesics in the usual manner; therefore, it is recommended that mild pain be treated with non-opioid analgesics and that moderate to severe pain be treated with higher potency NSAIDs on a short-term basis. Oral naltrexone should be discontinued 72 hours before surgery and extended-release injectable naltrexone should be discontinued 30 days before an anticipated surgery. Naltrexone's blockade of the mu opioid receptor can often be overcome when necessary with high potency full agonist opioids, and in these instances patients should be closely monitored in an emergency department or hospital setting.

"This may take up to 14 days, but can typically be achieved in 7 days". "A naloxone challenge (administration of 0.4–0.8 mg naloxone and observation for precipitated withdrawal) may be useful before initiating treatment with naltrexone to document the absence of physiological dependence and to minimize the risk for precipitated withdrawal".

### HIV clinic-based extended-release naltrexone versus treatment as usual for people with HIV and opioid use disorder: a non-blinded, randomized non-inferiority trial [^6178744a]. Addiction (2022). Medium credibility.

Our findings advance those of previous studies of the impact of MOUD on HIV clinical outcomes in people with uncontrolled HIV disease and OUD, and in particular the potential effect of XR‐NTX on HIV viral suppression. Remarkably, half of participants in this high‐needs study population, overall, achieved HIV viral suppression by 24 weeks. In a US trial randomizing incarcerated individuals with HIV and OUD to XR‐NTX versus placebo injection prior to release, 30% of those with non‐suppressed HIV at baseline who received XR‐NTX achieved HIV viral suppression at 6 months. In a trial in Russia, people with OUD and untreated HIV were randomized to receive long‐acting naltrexone implants or daily oral naltrexone dosing. At 24 weeks, 38% of those assigned to long‐acting naltrexone and 35% of those assigned to oral naltrexone achieved an HIV viral load < 400 copies/ml. HIV viral suppression rates of 52.7% at 24 weeks among those randomized to XR‐NTX in the CHOICES trial exceeds viral suppression observed in these prior studies, as well as a systematic review of 32 mainly observational studies that reported a 45% increase in HIV viral suppression attributed to opioid agonist treatment. Our results suggest that initiating XR‐NTX in a non‐addiction specialty outpatient setting facilitates HIV viral suppression on a level comparable to initiating opioid agonist treatment. While OUD treatment adherence most probably mediates the effect of XR‐NTX on HIV viral suppression, XR‐NTX may also mitigate risky decision‐making and improve treatment adherence through central effects on the reward pathway.

### Feasibility and safety of extended-release naltrexone treatment of opioid and alcohol use disorder in HIV clinics: a pilot / feasibility randomized trial [^86cc280a]. Addiction (2017). Low credibility.

Background and Aims

HIV-infected people with substance use disorders are least likely to benefit from advances in HIV treatment. Integration of extended-release naltrexone (XR-NTX) into HIV clinics may increase engagement in the HIV care continuum by decreasing substance use. We aimed to compare (1) XR-NTX treatment initiation, (2) retention and (3) safety of XR-NTX versus treatment as usual (TAU) for treating opioid use disorder (OUD) and/or alcohol use disorder (AUD) in HIV clinics.

Design

Non-blinded randomized trial of XR-NTX versus pharmacotherapy TAU.

Setting

HIV primary care clinics in Vancouver, BC, Canada and Chicago, IL, USA.

Participants

Fifty-one HIV-infected patients seeking treatment for OUD (n = 16), AUD (n = 27) or both OUD and AUD (n = 8).

Measurements

Primary outcomes were XR-NTX initiation (receipt of first injection within 4 weeks of randomization) and retention at 16 weeks. Secondary outcomes generated point estimates for change in substance use, HIV viral suppression [HIV RNA polymerase chain reaction (pcr) < 200 copies/ml] and safety.

Findings

Two-thirds (68%) of participants assigned to XR-NTX initiated treatment, and 88% of these were retained on XR-NTX at 16 weeks. In comparison, 96% of TAU participants initiated treatment, but only 50% were retained on medication at 16 weeks. Mean days of opioid use in past 30 days decreased from 17.3 to 4.1 for TAU and from 20.3 to 7.7 for XR-NTX. Mean heavy drinking days decreased from 15.6 to 5.7 for TAU and 12.5 to 2.8 for XR-NTX. Among those with OUD, HIV suppression improved from 67 to 80% for XR-NTX and 58 to 75% for TAU. XR-NTX was well tolerated, with no precipitated withdrawals and one serious injection-site reaction.

Conclusions

Extended-release naltrexone (XR-NTX) is feasible and safe for treatment of opioid use disorder and alcohol use disorder in HIV clinics. Treatment initiation appears to be lower and retention greater for XR-NTX compared with treatment as usual (clinicaltrials.gov NCT01908062).

### CDC clinical practice guideline for prescribing opioids for pain-United States, 2022 [^b893ae3f]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Importantly, opioid dosage thresholds for caution in the treatment of pain are not applicable to opioid agonist treatment of opioid use disorder because recommended dosages of methadone and buprenorphine for opioid use disorder differ from those for pain management. No recommended duration limit exists for treatment of opioid use disorder with buprenorphine or methadone, and discontinuation is associated with risks for return to drug use and opioid overdose. If discontinued, buprenorphine should be tapered very gradually (over several months).

Compared with buprenorphine, which can be prescribed by clinicians with a waiver in any setting or dispensed from a SAMHSA-certified opioid treatment program, ongoing methadone treatment for opioid use disorder can only be provided through an opioid treatment program. As short-term exceptions, any clinician may administer (but not prescribe) methadone or buprenorphine to treat acute opioid withdrawal for up to 3 days, while working to refer the patient to opioid use disorder treatment. Previously, up to a 1-day supply could be administered per day for up to 3 days; in December 2020, Congress directed the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) to revise regulations to allow for a 3-day supply of medication to be dispensed at one time; DEA subsequently advised practitioners how to request exceptions to the 1-day supply limitation pending amendment of 21 CFR 1306.07(b). Patients already receiving treatment for opioid use disorder and admitted for other medical reasons may continue to directly receive methadone or buprenorphine treatment in an emergency department or in a hospital throughout inpatient hospitalization.

Naltrexone does not require a waiver and can be prescribed in any setting. Additional recommendations have been published previously on naltrexone treatment for opioid use disorder. A minimum of 7–10 days free of opioids is recommended before the first naltrexone dose to avoid precipitation of severe opioid withdrawal. Extended-release injectable naltrexone is typically administered every 4 weeks by deep intramuscular injection in the gluteal muscle at 380 mg per injection, alternating buttocks for each subsequent injection. Certain patients, including those who metabolize naltrexone more rapidly, might benefit from dosing as frequently as every 3 weeks. Oral naltrexone is no longer recommended and should not be used except under very limited circumstances. No recommended duration limit exists for treatment of opioid use disorder with naltrexone. If discontinued, naltrexone can be stopped abruptly without precipitating withdrawal symptoms. Clinicians should warn patients who discontinue naltrexone of the risk for potentially fatal opioid overdose if opioid use is resumed, because of the loss of tolerance to the previous opioid dosage.

### Treating opioid dependence with injectable extended-release naltrexone (XR-NTX): who will respond? [^ce8cdc11]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Objectives

Once-monthly intramuscular extended-release naltrexone (XR-NTX) has demonstrated efficacy for the prevention of relapse in opioid dependence, providing an alternative to agonist or partial agonist maintenance (ie, methadone and buprenorphine). The question remains, for whom is this unique treatment most efficacious and can patient-treatment matching factors be identified?

Methods

A moderator analysis was conducted on a previously reported 24-week, placebo-controlled, multisite, randomized controlled trial of XR-NTX (n = 126) versus placebo (n = 124) among recently detoxified opioid-dependent adults in Russia, which showed XR-NTX superior to placebo in proportion of opioid abstinent weeks. The moderator analysis examined a dichotomous indicator of good clinical response-achieving at least 90% of weeks abstinent over the 24-week trial. A series of logistic regression models were fit for this outcome as functions of treatment (XR-NTX vs placebo), each baseline moderator variable, and their interactions. The 25 baseline variables included demographics, clinical severity (Addiction Severity Index, SF-36, and Clinical Global Impression-Severity), functioning (EQ-5D), craving, and HIV serostatus (HIV+).

Results

More XR-NTX patients achieved 90% abstinence (64/126, 51%) versus placebo (39/124, 31%; P = 0.002). There were no significant interactions between baseline variables and treatment. There was a significant main effect of Clinical Global Impression-Severity score (P = 0.02), such that higher severity score was associated with a lower rate of Good Clinical Response.

Conclusions

The absence of significant baseline by treatment interactions indicates that no patient-treatment matching variables could be identified. This suggests that XR-NTX was effective in promoting abstinence from opioids across a range of demographic and severity characteristics.

### HIV clinic-based extended-release naltrexone versus treatment as usual for people with HIV and opioid use disorder: a non-blinded, randomized non-inferiority trial [^be44cd6a]. Addiction (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background and aim

Opioid agonist medications for treatment of opioid use disorder (OUD) can improve human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) outcomes and reduce opioid use. We tested whether outpatient antagonist treatment with naltrexone could achieve similar results.

Design

Open‐label, non‐inferiority randomized trial.

Setting

Six US HIV primary care clinics.

Participants

A total of 114 participants with untreated HIV and OUD (62% male; 56% black, 12% Hispanic; positive for fentanyl (62%), other opioids (47%) and cocaine (60%) at baseline). Enrollment halted early due to slow recruitment.

Intervention

HIV clinic‐based extended‐release naltrexone (XR‐NTX; n = 55) versus treatment as usual (TAU) with buprenorphine or methadone (TAU; n = 59).

Measurements

Treatment group differences were compared for the primary outcome of viral suppression (HIV RNA ≤ 200 copies/ml) at 24 weeks and secondary outcomes included past 30‐day use of opioids at 24 weeks.

Findings

Fewer XR‐NTX participants initiated medication compared with TAU participants (47 versus 73%). The primary outcome of viral suppression was comparable for XR‐NTX (52.7%) and TAU (49.2%) [risk ratio (RR) = 1.064; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.748, 1.514] at 24 weeks. Non‐inferiority could not be demonstrated, as the lower confidence limit of the RR did not exceed the pre‐specified margin of 0.75 in intention‐to‐treat (ITT) analysis. The main secondary outcome of past 30‐day opioid use was comparable for XR‐NTX versus TAU (11.7 versus 14.8 days; mean difference = −3.1; 95% CI = –8.7, 1.1) in ITT analysis. Among those initiating medication, XR‐NTX resulted in fewer days of opioid use compared with TAU in the past 30 days (6.0 versus 13.6, mean difference = −7.6; 95% CI = –13.8, −0.2).

Conclusions

A randomized controlled trial found supportive, but not conclusive, evidence that human immunodeficiency virus clinic‐based extended‐release naltrexone is not inferior to treatment as usual for facilitating human immunodeficiency virus viral suppression. Participants who initiated extended‐release naltrexone used fewer opioids than those who received treatment as usual.

Opioid withdrawal — onset, duration, and precipitated withdrawal: Opioid withdrawal generally results from the cessation or a dramatic reduction in the dose of opioids. For short-acting opioids such as heroin and oxycodone, symptoms usually emerge within 12 hours of the last opioid use, peak within 24–48 hours, and diminish over 3–5 days. For long-acting opioids such as methadone, withdrawal symptoms generally emerge within 30 hours of the last methadone exposure and may last up to 10 days. Abrupt discontinuation of opioids is not recommended because it may precipitate withdrawal, lead to strong cravings, and result in relapse to drug use. Signs and symptoms of precipitated withdrawal are similar to those of spontaneous withdrawal, but the time course is different, and symptoms may be much more severe. The timing of maximal precipitated withdrawal usually occurs within 1 minute for intravenously administered naloxone, several minutes after IM naloxone, up to 90 minutes after sublingual buprenorphine, and up to several hours after extended-release injectable naltrexone. Naloxone-precipitated withdrawal typically lasts for 30–60 minutes, whereas naltrexone-precipitated withdrawal may last for several days. Withdrawal management is not necessary or recommended for patients being referred for treatment with methadone or buprenorphine.

### HIV clinic-based extended-release naltrexone versus treatment as usual for people with HIV and opioid use disorder: a non-blinded, randomized non-inferiority trial [^d3df9081]. Addiction (2022). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Opioid use disorder (OUD) is common in people living with HIV and associated with decreased receipt of antiretroviral therapy (ART), decreased ART adherence and decreased HIV viral suppression. Treatment of substance use disorders can increase engagement in HIV care.

Opioid agonist therapy for OUD with either methadone or sublingual buprenorphine decreases HIV transmission risk behaviors and improves HIV and OUD outcomes, but access to medications for opioid use disorder treatment (MOUD) remains limited. HIV providers are well positioned to integrate MOUD into HIV treatment settings, but thus far only buprenorphine has been adopted in HIV practice. In the buprenorphine–HIV evaluation and support (BHIVES) collaborative (a demonstration of integrated care for HIV and OUD), people living with HIV and OUD who received buprenorphine from an HIV clinic provider decreased opioid use, increased ART use and experienced higher‐quality HIV care. HIV treatment guidelines recommend opioid agonist therapy as a key treatment strategy for engaging people who inject drugs (PWID) in HIV treatment. However, retention on methadone and buprenorphine may be limited due to daily dosing requirements. While the recent emergence of extended‐release formulations may mitigate daily dosing challenges, they are not widely available and some patients prefer alternatives to agonist treatment.

Extended‐release naltrexone (XR‐NTX), a deep muscle opioid antagonist injection that lasts 28 days, may be preferred by some people living with HIV who are seeking a non‐narcotic treatment option and/or once a month dosing, thus potentially increasing the number of people who engage in OUD treatment. In inpatient specialty addiction treatment settings, XR‐NTX decreases opioid use comparable to sublingual buprenorphine after receiving the first XR‐NTX injection while an inpatient. However, induction onto XR‐NTX following medically supervised withdrawal from active opioid use is challenging, and resulted in suboptimal outcomes compared to sublingual buprenorphine in intent‐to‐treat (ITT) analyses. In incarcerated individuals with OUD and HIV, XR‐NTX initiated prior to release increased HIV viral suppression at 6 months compared with those randomized to placebo. Similarly, a long‐acting naltrexone implant achieved greater HIV suppression compared to oral naltrexone in a trial in Russia.

Part 3: Treating Opioid Withdrawal

Using medications for opioid withdrawal management is recommended over abrupt cessation of opioids. Abrupt cessation of opioids may lead to strong cravings, which can lead to continued use.

Patients should be advised about risk of relapse and other safety concerns from using opioid withdrawal management as standalone treatment for opioid use disorder. Opioid withdrawal management on its own is not a treatment method.

Assessment of a patient undergoing opioid withdrawal management should include a thorough medical history and physical examination focusing on signs and symptoms associated with opioid withdrawal.

Opioid withdrawal management in cases in which methadone is used to manage withdrawal symptoms must be done in an inpatient setting or in an OTP. For short-acting opioids, tapering schedules that decrease in daily doses of prescribed methadone should begin with doses between 20 and 30 mg per day, and should be completed in 6–10 days.

Opioid-dependent patients should wait until they are experiencing mild to moderate opioid withdrawal before taking the first dose of buprenorphine to reduce the risk of precipitated withdrawal.

The use of combinations of buprenorphine and low doses of oral naltrexone to manage withdrawal and facilitate the accelerated introduction of extended-release injectable naltrexone has shown promise. More research will be needed before this can be accepted as standard practice.

The Guideline Committee recommends, based on consensus opinion, the inclusion of clonidine as a practice to support opioid withdrawal. Clonidine is not US FDA-approved for the treatment of opioid withdrawal, but it has been extensively used off-label for this purpose. Clonidine may be used orally or transdermally at doses of 0.1–0.3 mg every 6–8 hours, with a maximum dose of 1.2 mg daily to assist in the management of opioid withdrawal symptoms. There is a delay in response using transdermal clonidine that may require oral supplementation on day 1. Its hypotensive effects often limit the amount that can be used. Clonidine can be combined with other non-narcotic medications targeting specific opioid withdrawal symptoms such as benzodiazepines for anxiety, loperamide for diarrhea, acetaminophen or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications (NSAIDs) for pain, and ondansetron or other agents for nausea.

Opioid withdrawal management using anesthesia – ultrarapid opioid detoxification (UROD) – is not recommended due to high risk for adverse events or death. Naltrexone-facilitated opioid withdrawal management can be a well tolerated and effective approach, but should be used only by clinicians experienced in this clinical method, and in cases in which anesthesia or conscious sedation is not being employed.

Naloxone and naltrexone-related terms — naloxone, naloxone challenge, and naltrexone-facilitated opioid withdrawal management — are defined for clinical context: Naloxone is a short-acting opioid antagonist. A naloxone challenge is a test in which naloxone is administered to patients to evaluate their level of opioid dependence before the commencement of naltrexone pharmacotherapy. Naltrexone-facilitated opioid withdrawal management is a method of withdrawal management that involves the use of multiple small doses of naltrexone, sometimes in combination with buprenorphine, over several days to manage withdrawal and facilitate the initiation of treatment with naltrexone.

### Sustained-release naltrexone for opioid dependence [^3f2c74f9]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Opioid dependence is a severe and often lifelong disorder with a high risk of overdose and premature death, as well as severe psychosocial difficulties. Sustained-release naltrexone is a treatment option that works by blocking the euphoric and overdose effects of opioids. When injected intramuscularly, naltrexone provides blockade for one month, while the blocking effects with implants can last for up to six months.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of sustained-release naltrexone for the treatment of opioid dependence.

Search Methods

For this update, we searched the following databases from 2007 up to 20 December 2023: the Cochrane Drugs and Alcohol Specialised Register of Trials, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, ISI Web of Science, LILACS, ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. We manually searched the reference lists of identified studies, published reviews and relevant websites.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials comparing the effects of injectable or implantable naltrexone with other treatment, no treatment or placebo in adults with opioid dependence.

Data Collection and Analysis

Primary outcomes were illicit opioid use, retention in treatment, treatment acceptability and adverse events. Secondary outcomes were opioid craving, recreational use of substances other than opioids, mental health, quality of life and criminal activity. We assessed the risk of bias using the Cochrane risk of bias tool (RoB 1). We combined the results of individual trials through meta-analysis where possible using a random-effects model. Two review authors independently assessed the certainty of the evidence using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach.

Main Results

We identified 22 studies (3416 participants) that met our inclusion criteria. Three studies compared sustained-release naltrexone with opioid agonist treatment, five with oral naltrexone, six with placebo, nine with treatment as usual and one with psychosocial intervention. Sustained-release naltrexone compared with opioid agonist treatment We found moderate-certainty evidence that sustained-release naltrexone probably increases in-treatment illicit opioid use slightly (risk ratio (RR) 1.15, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.01 to 1.31; 1 study, 570 participants). The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of sustained-release naltrexone on retention in treatment (RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.76; 3 studies, 773 participants) and treatment acceptability (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.16; 3 studies, 773 participants). There was low-certainty evidence that sustained-release naltrexone may increase serious adverse events slightly in comparison with opioid agonist treatment for serious adverse events (RR 1.40, 95% CI 0.92 to 2.11; 2 studies, 713 participants). Sustained-release naltrexone compared with oral naltrexone treatment We found low-certainty evidence that sustained-release naltrexone may reduce in-treatment illicit opioid use (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.93; 1 study, 69 participants). The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of sustained-release naltrexone on retention in treatment (RR 2.40, 95% CI 1.64 to 3.52; 3 studies, 464 participants) and on serious adverse events (RR 1.25, 95% CI 0.46 to 3.36; 2 studies, 260 participants). There was low-certainty evidence that sustained-release naltrexone may result in little to no difference in treatment acceptability in comparison with oral naltrexone treatment (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.01; 3 studies, 474 participants). Sustained-release naltrexone compared with placebo We found low-certainty evidence that sustained-release naltrexone may result in little to no difference in in-treatment illicit opioid use (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.03; 3 studies, 443 participants), treatment acceptability (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.02; 1 study, 204 participants) and serious adverse events (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.17 to 3.23; 3 studies, 443 participants). The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of sustained-release naltrexone on retention in treatment in comparison with placebo (RR 2.10, 95% CI 1.23 to 3.60; 4 studies, 594 participants). Sustained-release naltrexone compared with treatment as usual We found high-certainty evidence that sustained-release naltrexone reduces in-treatment illicit opioid use (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.90; 4 studies, 479 participants). There was low-certainty evidence that sustained-release naltrexone may result in little or no difference in retention in treatment (RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.82; 3 studies, 126 participants) and that it may result in a slight reduction in treatment acceptability (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.69 to 0.90; 8 studies, 1094 participants). There was moderate-certainty evidence that sustained-release naltrexone probably reduces serious adverse events in comparison with treatment as usual (RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.95; 6 studies, 1009 participants). Our primary outcome measures were not reported for sustained-release naltrexone compared with psychosocial treatments. Amongst the most common methodological weaknesses were the risk of performance bias and imprecision due to few studies and small sample size for many outcomes.

Authors' Conclusions

Sustained-release naltrexone may slightly increase illicit opioid use and serious adverse events compared to opioid agonists, with uncertain effects on retention and acceptability. It may reduce illicit opioid use compared to oral naltrexone but has uncertain effects on other outcomes. Compared to placebo, it may have little to no impact on key outcomes. Compared to treatment as usual, it reduces illicit opioid use and may reduce serious adverse events but has little effect on retention and slightly reduces acceptability. Significant gaps remain in the evidence on sustained-release naltrexone for opioid dependence. Future research should include comparisons with psychosocial treatments, larger and higher-quality studies, and analyses of differences between formulations and comparator treatments. Improved study designs are needed to reduce bias, and more inclusive research should address under-represented populations and synthetic opioid users. The lack of long-term outcome data limits understanding of sustained effects, highlighting the need for extended follow-up and exploration of diverse treatment settings and populations.

### A randomized trial comparing extended-release injectable suspension and oral naltrexone, both combined with behavioral therapy, for the treatment of opioid use disorder [^f4bd7c1d]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

The oral formulation of the opioid antagonist naltrexone has shown limited effectiveness for treatment of opioid use disorder due to poor adherence. Long-acting injection naltrexone (XR-naltrexone), administered monthly, circumvents the need for daily pill taking, potentially improving adherence, and has been shown to be superior to placebo in reducing opioid use over 6 months of treatment. This open-label trial compared the outcomes of patients with opioid use disorder treated with XR-naltrexone or oral naltrexone in combination with behavioral therapy.

Method

Sixty opioid-dependent adults completed inpatient opioid withdrawal and were transitioned to oral naltrexone. They were stratified by severity of opioid use (six or fewer bags versus more than six bags of heroin per day) and randomly assigned (1:1) to continue treatment with oral naltrexone (N = 32) or XR-naltrexone (N = 28) for 24 weeks. The first dose of XR-naltrexone (380 mg) was administered prior to discharge, with monthly doses thereafter, and oral naltrexone was given in a 50-mg daily dose. All participants received weekly behavioral therapy to support treatment and adherence to naltrexone.

Results

A Cox proportional hazards model adjusting for race, gender, route of use, and baseline opioid use severity indicated that significantly more patients were retained in treatment for 6 months in the XR-naltrexone group (16 of 28 patients, 57.1%) than in the oral naltrexone group (nine of 32 patients, 28.1%) (hazard ratio = 2.18, 95% CI = 1.07, 4.43).

Conclusions

Patients receiving XR-naltrexone had twice the rate of treatment retention at 6 months compared with those taking oral naltrexone. These results support the use of XR-naltrexone combined with behavioral therapy as an effective treatment for patients seeking opioid withdrawal and nonagonist treatment for preventing relapse to opioid use disorder.

### Comparative effectiveness of extended-release naltrexone versus buprenorphine-naloxone on treatment interruption: comparing findings from a reanalysis of the X: BOT RCT and harmonized target trial emulation using population-based observational data [^319d2ce5]. Addiction (2025). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

It is unclear if findings from randomized controlled trials (RCT) of medications for opioid use disorder apply to real-world settings. We estimated the effectiveness of buprenorphine-naloxone (BUP-NX) versus extended-release naltrexone (XR-NTX) on treatment interruption in a RCT and an observational study based on real-world data.

Design

Target trial emulation to harmonize the protocol and statistical analyses of X:BOT (target trial) and the observational study (observational emulation). Baseline was randomization in the target trial and medically managed opioid withdrawal (MMOW) discharge in the observational emulation.

Settings

X:BOT trial and Massachusetts Public Health Data Warehouse observational data (United States).

Participants

The target trial included all X:BOT participants. The observational emulation trial included MMOW discharges from January 2014 to May 2016.

Measurements

Treatment strategies were BUP-NX versus XR-NTX initiation within 28days of baseline. The outcome was treatment interruption (earliest of treatment discontinuation, incarceration, MMOW readmission, death). We estimated the 24-week risk and risk difference.

Findings

In the target trial, 94% (269/287) and 66% (187/283) of participants randomized to BUP-NX or XR-NTX initiated their assigned treatment within 28days, respectively. In the observational emulation, BUP-NX and XR-NTX were initiated within 28days in 9% (5209/59 076) and 3% (1813/59 076) of MMOW discharges, respectively. The adjusted 24-week treatment interruption risks (95% confidence interval) for BUP-NX and XR-NTX were 68% (60%,77%) and 72% (60%,83%) in the target trial [risk difference, -4 percentage points (pp; -17pp,11pp)] and 82% (81%,83%) and 93% (92%,95%) in the observational emulation [risk difference,-11pp (-13pp,-10 pp)].

Conclusions

Buprenorphine-naloxone might be superior to extended-release naltrexone in real-world settings where the majority of people struggle to remain on medications for opioid use disorder. Buprenorphine-naloxone initiators had a lower risk of treatment interruption than extended-release naltrexone initiators in an observational emulation, but similar risks in a randomized controlled trial, although confidence intervals were wide. Trial participation, study size and residual confounding may explain these differences.

### Comparative effectiveness of extended-release naltrexone and sublingual buprenorphine for treatment of opioid use disorder among medicaid patients [^5e2f6941]. Addiction (2024). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Extended-release naltrexone (XR-NTX) and sublingual buprenorphine (SL-BUP) are both approved for opioid use disorder (OUD) treatment in any medical setting. We aimed to compare the real-world effectiveness of XR-NTX and SL-BUP.

Design and Setting

This was an observational active comparator, new user cohort study of Medicaid claims records for patients in New Jersey and California, USA, 2016–19.

Participants/Cases

The participants were adult Medicaid patients aged 18-64years who initiated XR-NTX or SL-BUP for maintenance treatment of OUD and did not use medications for OUD in the 90days before initiation. Our cohort included 1755 XR-NTX and 9886 SL-BUP patients.

Measurements

We examined two outcomes up to 180days after medication initiation: (1) composite of medication discontinuation and death and (2) composite of overdose and death.

Findings

In adjusted analyses, treatment with XR-NTX was more likely to result in discontinuation or death by the end of follow-up than treatment with SL-BUP: cumulative risk 75.9% [95% confidence interval (CI) = 73.9%, 77.9%] versus 62.2% (95% CI = 61.2%, 63.2%), respectively (risk difference = 13.7 percentage points, 95% CI = 11.4, 16.0). There was minimal difference in the cumulative risk of overdose or death by the end of follow-up: XR-NTX 3.9% (95% CI = 3.0%, 4.8%) versus SL-BUP 3.3% (95% CI = 2.9%, 3.7%); risk difference = 0.5 percentage points, 95% CI = -0.4, 1.5. Results were consistent across sensitivity analyses.

Conclusions

Medicaid patients in California and New Jersey, USA, receiving treatment for opioid use disorder stayed in treatment longer on sublingual buprenorphine than on extended-release naltrexone, but the risk of overdose was similar. Most patients in this study discontinued medication within 6 months, regardless of which medication was initiated.

### Extended-release injection vs sublingual buprenorphine for opioid use disorder with fentanyl use: a post hoc analysis of a randomized clinical trial [^5c62b7d6]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Consistent with the primary outcome analysis, the main association of medication with the summary score of percentage of urine samples negative for any opioids suggests that subcutaneous buprenorphine is modestly more effective than buprenorphine-naloxone in reducing overall opioid use. The difference between treatment groups in the fentanyl-positive subgroup, although numerically favoring subcutaneous buprenorphine, was not significant. However, the treatment by time interaction in the repeated-measures analysis suggests that after the slow start for opioid-negative urine samples in the fentanyl-positive subgroup mentioned above, those treated with subcutaneous buprenorphine had more negative urine samples than those treated with buprenorphine-naloxone in the later weeks of the trial (Figure 2). Furthermore, within the fentanyl-positive subgroup, the summary scores of percentage of urine samples negative for fentanyl or norfentanyl were significantly greater among those treated with subcutaneous buprenorphine compared with buprenorphine-naloxone. An extended-release injectable formulation of buprenorphine may be advantageous, particularly for more severely ill patients using fentanyl, perhaps due to blood levels of the medication being more sustained than with sublingual buprenorphine-naloxone (for which patients may miss daily doses). The extended-release injectable formulation of naltrexone has been found to be advantageous for patients with alcohol use disorder or OUD and indicators of greater severity or adverse social determinants.

In the present study, there was no evidence of greater early dropout or withdrawal symptoms suggestive of precipitated withdrawal among the fentanyl-positive subgroup, consistent with recent studies. However, precipitated withdrawal continues to be described when buprenorphine is initiated in the setting of fentanyl or other high-potency opioids, which have increased in prevalence and in likely levels of exposure since the present study. As this study was not specifically designed to evaluate withdrawal during buprenorphine initiation, more research is needed to clarify the factors and conditions that may complicate buprenorphine initiation among individuals using high-potency opioids.

### A step forward in the treatment of opioid and alcohol dependence… [^4f7eb687]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Dr. Sara Roach: Welcome to "Q&A with FDA, " from the FDA's Division of Drug Information where we aim to answer some of the most frequently asked questions that we've received from the public. I'm Dr. Sara Roach, and today's topic is the recent first generic approval to Vivitrol, a one-month extended-release injectable naltrexone that is used to help people recovering from opioid or alcohol dependence. Dr. Sokolowska: For most patients treated with medication for alcohol use disorder, the decision to begin oral versus injectable naltrexone is based on patient's preference, but injectable naltrexone may be more effective in ensuring adherence. Pharmacologic treatment of alcohol use disorder has been focused on altering the reinforcing effects of alcohol use. Naltrexone is available as an oral medication but also as the extended-release injectable product, Vivitrol, which has been approved since 2006. Dr.

Roach: Naltrexone is an opioid antagonist and is indicated for the treatment of alcohol dependence in patients who are able to abstain from alcohol in an outpatient setting prior to initiation of treatment with the long-acting naltrexone injectable product. In addition, this medication is approved for the prevention of relapse to opioid dependence, following opioid detoxification, and should be part of a comprehensive management program that includes psychosocial support. Dr. Sokolowska: Yes, it's important because naltrexone is a treatment option for either disorder and is long acting. And by virtue of increasing the availability of generic drugs, it helps to create competition in the marketplace, which then helps to make treatment more affordable, increasing access to healthcare for more patients.

Once-a-month extended-release injection reduces the dose frequency and therefore may be advantageous in helping ensure patients' compliance, which is crucial to reduce potential relapse. Dr. Roach: As you mentioned the brand name Vivitrol was approved in 2006, 17 years ago. Tell us about why the new generic to Vivitrol, the extended-release injectable naltrexone, is just now approved. Dr. Murphy: In order for a generic product to Vivitrol to be approved, it had to address several challenges in developing, manufacturing, and demonstrating that their naltrexone microsphere product was therapeutically equivalent to Vivitrol. One of these difficulties was selecting a PLG polymer that has comparable physicochemical and drug release properties to that brand product.

Regarding medical management for opioid use disorder, more specifically with respect to naltrexone, ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend to insufficient evidence to recommend a duration of naltrexone treatment. Decide on the duration depending on the clinical judgment and the patient's individual circumstances. Recognize that naltrexone can be stopped abruptly without withdrawal symptoms because there is no physical dependence associated with naltrexone.

### HIV clinic-based extended-release naltrexone versus treatment as usual for people with HIV and opioid use disorder: a non-blinded, randomized non-inferiority trial [^1a6fd63d]. Addiction (2022). Medium credibility.

Despite limited XR‐NTX uptake, all CHOICES participants experienced marked reductions in opioid use that compare favorably with changes in opioid use in previous trials. In ITT analysis, self‐reported opioid use and UDS opioid positivity decreased comparably in participants assigned to the XR‐NTX arm compared to those assigned to TAU. Among those who initiated OUD treatment, reductions in opioid use were greater in the XR‐NTX than the TAU arm. Our findings contrast with those of a large comparative effectiveness trial of XR‐NTX versus sublingual buprenorphine, which demonstrated higher rates of return to opioid use at 24 weeks for XR‐NTX (65%) than for buprenorphine [57%; hazard ratio (HR) = 1·36; 95% CI = 1·10–1·68] in the ITT analysis, and comparable rates of return to use in the per protocol analysis. In a second trial of XR‐NTX versus sublingual buprenorphine conducted in a specialty addiction treatment setting in Norway, XR‐NTX was non‐inferior to buprenorphine for the primary outcome of the proportion of UDS negative for opioids at 12 weeks, and superior to buprenorphine for opioid craving. People with OUD who initiated XR‐NTX in the CHOICES trial may have benefited from the additional wrap‐around primary care, HIV and social services offered in outpatient HIV primary care clinics. Another notable difference between previous trials and the CHOICES study is the high prevalence of fentanyl in the study population. Fentanyl was the most common opioid detected on baseline UDS in the CHOICES study and previous studies were conducted prior to the upsurge in fentanyl use. While fentanyl may decrease the utility of XR‐NTX due to initiation challenges, it is possible that, once started, XR‐NTX might be more effective than buprenorphine in reducing opioid cravings, as suggested by the Norwegian trial. Further research is required to assess the role of fentanyl in starting MOUD treatment. Recently approved long‐acting injectable buprenorphine may also serve as a more equivalent comparator than daily dosed formulations.

### Opioid use and dropout from extended-release naltrexone in a controlled trial: implications for mechanism [^06d6d71c]. Addiction (2020). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Extended-release formulations of naltrexone have emerged as effective treatment options for opioid use disorder. This post-hoc analysis examined the temporal relationship between episodes of opioid use and subsequent dropout in a placebo-controlled trial of extended-release injection naltrexone (XR-NTX) to draw inferences about the mechanism by which extended blockade of opioid receptors translates into clinical effectiveness.

Design

This was a 24-week multiple-site, double-blind, randomized trial of monthly XR-NTX versus placebo injections. We analyzed time to dropout from treatment using survival analysis with an extended Cox model as a function of treatment (XR-NTX versus placebo) and with weekly urine drug test (UDT) results for opioids at each week as a time-dependent covariate.

Setting

Thirteen addiction treatment programs in Russia, 2008–09.

Participants

A total of 250 adults with opioid use disorder who had completed in-patient detoxification.

Intervention

XR-NTX injection or placebo injection every 4 weeks with weekly clinic visits and biweekly counseling.

Measurements

Urine toxicology for opioids measured weekly and week of dropout from treatment.

Findings

The Cox model yielded a significant interaction of time-dependent urine toxicology by treatment (P = 0.024). Among patients receiving placebo, a positive UDT in a given week increased the risk for dropout from treatment in the subsequent week [hazard ratio (HR) = 6.25; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 3.6–10.0], whereas among patients receiving XR-NTX, a positive UDT result showed no significant effect on risk for dropout (HR = 1.67; 95% CI = 0.6–4.5). The proportion of patients who completed all 24 weeks without any positive UDT result was 31% on XR-NTX compared with 20% on placebo (P = 0.051).

Conclusions

Extended-release injection naltrexone was effective at reducing the risk of dropout from opioid use disorder treatment after an episode of opioid use. Just under a third of patients (31%) on XR-NTX had no opioid-positive urine tests across the trial, but the hypothesis that this would differ from placebo (20%) was not confirmed.

### The ASAM national practice guideline for the treatment of opioid use disorder: 2020 focused update [^2a10df97]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Risk of relapse and subsequent opioid overdose is emphasized: patients maintained on naltrexone may have diminished tolerance and may be unaware of increased sensitivity if they stop taking naltrexone; patients who discontinue antagonist therapy should be made aware, because if they stop naltrexone and resume use at doses not reflecting lost tolerance there is risk of opioid overdose, with a similar dynamic after withdrawal management without meaningful follow-up or after dropping out of methadone or buprenorphine treatment.

Comparative and alternative approaches during withdrawal management: One study concluded that there are no significant differences in treatment completion with methadone versus buprenorphine, while one study found methadone was superior to placebo; three RCTs concluded buprenorphine may be more effective than methadone, and buprenorphine and methadone were more effective than clonidine; rapid induction onto naltrexone ER using low dose naltrexone may be an option when opioid agonist therapy is not available or desired.

### Long-acting injectable naltrexone induction: a randomized trial of outpatient opioid detoxification with naltrexone versus buprenorphine [^e49f0d26]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

At present there is no established optimal approach for transitioning opioid-dependent adults to extended-release injection naltrexone (XR-naltrexone) while preventing relapse. The authors conducted a trial examining the efficacy of two methods of outpatient opioid detoxification for induction to XR-naltrexone.

Method

Participants were 150 opioid-dependent adults randomly assigned 2:1 to one of two outpatient detoxification regimens, naltrexone-assisted detoxification or buprenorphine-assisted detoxification, followed by an injection of XR-naltrexone. Naltrexone-assisted detoxification lasted 7 days and included a single day of buprenorphine followed by ascending doses of oral naltrexone along with clonidine and other adjunctive medications. Buprenorphine-assisted detoxification included a 7-day buprenorphine taper followed by a week-long delay before administration of XR-naltrexone, consistent with official prescribing information for XR-naltrexone. Participants from both groups received behavioral therapy focused on medication adherence and a second dose of XR-naltrexone.

Results

Compared with participants in the buprenorphine-assisted detoxification condition, participants assigned to naltrexone-assisted detoxification were significantly more likely to be successfully inducted to XR-naltrexone (56.1% compared with 32.7%) and to receive the second injection at week 5 (50.0% compared with 26.9%). Both models adjusted for primary type of opioid use, route of opioid administration, and morphine equivalents at baseline.

Conclusions

These results demonstrate the safety, efficacy, and tolerability of low-dose naltrexone, in conjunction with single-day buprenorphine dosing and adjunctive nonopioid medications, for initiating adults with opioid dependence to XR-naltrexone. This strategy offers a promising alternative to the high rates of attrition and relapse currently observed with agonist tapers in both inpatient and outpatient settings.

Psychosocial treatment in conjunction with naltrexone: The psychosocial needs of patients treated with naltrexone should be assessed, and patients should be offered or referred to psychosocial treatment based on individual needs. Psychosocial treatment should be offered in conjunction with naltrexone, but a patient's decision to decline or the absence of available psychosocial treatment should not preclude or delay treatment of opioid use disorder with naltrexone with appropriate medication management. Given limited evidence for extended-release naltrexone without psychosocial treatment, methadone or buprenorphine may be the preferred pharmacotherapy in the absence of psychosocial treatment.

### Adapting treatment length to opioid-dependent individuals' needs and preferences: a 2-year follow-up to a 1-year study of extended-release naltrexone [^e0c6ce7f]. Addiction (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Extended‐release naltrexone seems to be effective, well tolerated and feasible in long‐term treatment up to 3 years. Clinicians should be attentive to patients' needs and preferences and XR‐NTX treatment should be individually tailored with regard to duration and content.

Buprenorphine management — clinicians should take steps to reduce the chance of buprenorphine diversion; recommended strategies may include frequent office visits (e.g., weekly in early treatment), drug testing including testing for buprenorphine and metabolites, and recall visits for medication counts. Drug testing should be used to monitor patients for adherence to buprenorphine and use of illicit and controlled substances, and patients should be seen frequently at the beginning of treatment until they are determined to be stable. When transitioning from buprenorphine to naltrexone, 7–14 days should typically elapse between the last buprenorphine dose and the start of naltrexone, whereas when transitioning from buprenorphine to methadone there is no required time delay. There is no recommended time limit for pharmacological treatment with buprenorphine, and buprenorphine taper and discontinuation is a slow process with close monitoring recommended; buprenorphine tapering is generally accomplished over several months.

Regarding medical management for opioid use disorder, more specifically with respect to naltrexone, ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend to assess the patient's psychosocial needs and offer or refer to psychosocial treatment based on their individual needs, in conjunction with extended-release naltrexone. Do not preclude or delay treatment with naltrexone, with appropriate medication management, in case of a patient's decision to decline psychosocial treatment or the absence of available psychosocial treatment. Consider using motivational interviewing or enhancement to encourage patients to engage in psychosocial treatment services appropriate for addressing individual needs.

Naltrexone — drug interactions to consider before initiation: "Significant medication interactions to consider before starting naltrexone include the following:" "Naltrexone should not be used with methylnaltrexone or naloxegol". Because it is an opioid antagonist, "Naltrexone blocks the effects of opioid analgesics", and "Glyburide may increase serum concentration of naltrexone", warranting monitoring for increased toxicity effects such as liver enzyme elevations.

### CDC clinical practice guideline for prescribing opioids for pain-United States, 2022 [^24eeacc4]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Criteria 10 and 11 are not considered to be met for those persons taking opioids solely under appropriate medical supervision. Severity is specified as mild (2–3 criteria), moderate (4–5 criteria), or severe (≥ 6 criteria).

FDA-approved medications indicated for the treatment of opioid use disorder include buprenorphine (a partial agonist opioid), methadone (a full agonist opioid), and naltrexone (an opioid antagonist). Experts from OWG stated that partial agonist opioid, full agonist opioid, and opioid antagonist treatment should not be framed as equal options for opioid use disorder, noting that partial and full agonist opioid treatments have stronger evidence for better outcomes, do not require abstinence, have less challenges with initiation, and are much more widely used than opioid antagonist treatment. Clinical evidence reviews found evidence on the effectiveness of interventions (e.g. medications and behavioral treatments) for opioid use disorder related to prescription opioids to be limited. However, moderate-quality evidence indicated buprenorphine (a partial agonist opioid) and methadone (a full agonist opioid) to be effective in preventing return to drug use among patients with opioid use disorder involving heroin, although the presence of pain among patients in these studies is generally not described. In addition, a small number of studies have evaluated buprenorphine for patients with prescription opioid dependence (using DSM-IV criteria) and found it to be effective in preventing return to drug use. One study found that among persons with opioid use disorder, previous prescription opioid use predicts stabilization on buprenorphine. Another trial that performed buprenorphine initiation and then randomized patients to buprenorphine taper versus maintenance was terminated early without reporting of planned outcomes because all patients randomized to the taper arm switched to maintenance or experienced a return to drug use; five of six patients in the maintenance arm completed the trial. In another trial identified by the clinical evidence reviews, no difference was found between buprenorphine/naloxone and methadone in likelihood of retention in the study and in pain, function, or self-reported side effects. Buprenorphine and methadone treatment of opioid use disorder has been associated with reduced overdose deaths and reduced all-cause deaths. Naltrexone (an opioid antagonist) also can be used for opioid use disorder, particularly for highly motivated persons. Naltrexone blocks the effects of opioids if they are used. Naltrexone has not been evaluated in persons with concomitant pain and opioid use disorder, and opioid medications for pain generally cannot be used in patients receiving naltrexone. Naltrexone requires adherence to monthly, long-acting injections. The effectiveness of oral naltrexone can be limited by poor medication adherence, and oral naltrexone should not be used except under very limited circumstances (e.g. for patients who would be able to comply with observed daily dosing to enhance adherence). Naltrexone also must be started after full withdrawal from opioids, which is a challenge for some patients; however, for patients who have completed or are able to complete withdrawal, naltrexone has comparable effectiveness as buprenorphine in prevention of return to drug use.

### Effectiveness, safety and feasibility of extended-release naltrexone for opioid dependence: a 9-month follow-up to a 3-month randomized trial [^b2e70c2d]. Addiction (2018). Low credibility.

Background and Aim

This is a follow-up study of a previously published randomized clinical trial conducted in Norway that compared extended-release naltrexone (XR-NTX) to buprenorphine-naloxone (BP-NLX) over 3 months. At the conclusion of the trial, participants were offered their choice of study medication for an additional 9 months. While BP-NLX was available at no cost through opioid maintenance treatment programmes, XR-NTX was available only through study participation, accounting for why almost all participants chose XR-NTX in the follow-up. The aim of this follow-up study was to compare differences in outcome between adults with opioid dependence continuing XR-NTX and those inducted on XR-NTX for a 9-month period, on measures of effectiveness, safety and feasibility.

Design

In this prospective cohort study, participants were either continuing XR-NTX, changed from BP-NLX to XR-NTX or re-included into the study and inducted on XR-NTX treatment.

Setting

Five urban, out-patient addiction clinics in Norway.

Participants

Opioid-dependent adults continuing (n = 54) or inducted on (n = 63) XR-NTX.

Intervention

XR-NTX administrated as intramuscular injections (380 mg) every fourth week.

Measurements

Data on retention, use of heroin and other illicit substances, opioid craving, treatment satisfaction, addiction-related problems and adverse events were reported every fourth week.

Findings

Nine-month follow-up completion rates were 51.9% among participants continuing XR-NTX in the follow-up and 47.6% among those inducted on XR-NTX. Opioid abstinence rates were, respectively, 53.7 and 44.4%. No significant group differences were found in use of heroin and other opioids.

Conclusions

Opioid-dependent individuals who elect to switch from buprenorphine-naltrexone treatment after 3 months to extended-release naltrexone treatment for 9 months appear to experience similar treatment completion and abstinence rates and similar adverse event profiles to individuals who had been on extended-release naltrexone from the start of treatment.

### HIV clinic-based extended-release naltrexone versus treatment as usual for people with HIV and opioid use disorder: a non-blinded, randomized non-inferiority trial [^91d2a482]. Addiction (2022). Medium credibility.

An additional limitation is that excluding people with untreated OUD and already suppressed viral loads may have increased study internal validity at the expense of generalizability to people engaged in HIV care with untreated OUD, who remain at risk for overdose. Alternative primary outcomes such as maintenance of viral suppression have been used in other studies that included such participants, but would have required a larger sample size which was not feasible and could have biased the study results toward non‐inferiority.

One strength of the current study was its ability to recruit and retain a highly vulnerable population of people on the margins of the health‐care system who had high rates of unemployment, homelessness, history of overdose, and criminal justice involvement. These are people who may be most likely to benefit from long‐acting medication formulations and an essential group required for achieving HIV elimination. A second strength of the current study was the high proportion of participants from racial and ethnic minority groups and inclusion of monolingual Spanish‐speaking participants. Pre‐planned subgroup analyses demonstrated that XR‐NTX was non‐inferior to TAU in the ITT analysis for achieving HIV viral suppression among African American/black participants and among those of non‐Hispanic ethnicity. Further research is urgently needed to explore differences in the effects of and to improve access to MOUD treatment in people of minority race/ethnicity. A third strength was the novel primary outcome of HIV viral suppression, as previous studies focused on OUD outcomes.

Overall, the CHOICES trial affirms the importance of medications for OUD treatment for achieving HIV viral suppression in people who use drugs. The study suggests, but does not definitively demonstrate, that uptake of XR‐NTX in HIV clinics may improve HIV viral suppression and decrease opioid use as well as opioid agonist treatment. Outpatient initiation of XR‐NTX for the treatment of OUD among people with uncontrolled HIV disease is challenging. Better induction strategies are needed to successfully integrate XR‐NTX into HIV primary care settings. Based on the experiences of clinical staff in the CHOICES trial, one strategy may require development of systems of care that increase the availability of inpatient induction services with linkage to outpatient continuation services. Once initiated on XR‐NTX, patients may then benefit from decreased opioid use that otherwise hinders ART adherence and HIV disease control and stabilization.

### The ASAM national practice guideline for the treatment of opioid use disorder: 2020 focused update [^bcb3b991]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Naltrexone — criminal justice settings: "Extended-release injectable naltrexone has been shown to be effective for relapse prevention in some trials conducted in criminal justice settings". In a "24-week" trial versus usual care, extended-release naltrexone "was more effective than usual care in preventing opioid relapse". In a pilot among individuals on parole, "6 months of treatment with extended-release injectable naltrexone was associated with fewer opioid-positive urine drug screens and a reduced likelihood of reincarceration".

### Adapting treatment length to opioid-dependent individuals' needs and preferences: a 2-year follow-up to a 1-year study of extended-release naltrexone [^d4c3fba5]. Addiction (2020). Medium credibility.

The lack of urine drug testing (UDT) is another limitation of the study, as participants' reports of substance use could not be confirmed. In the parent study, however, the UDTs corresponded well with the information provided by the participants.

Study participants who decided to end treatment with XR‐NTX before 104 weeks were not allowed to re‐start treatment. Thus, this study does not reflect a real‐life clinical setting where patients may choose to stop the medication, regret their decision and be allowed to re‐start the medication. Some participants regretted ending XR‐NTX treatment before the end of the study, and requested re‐inclusion in the study. However, re‐inclusion was not a part of the study design, and thus participants who relapsed to opioid use were recommended to consider initiating agonist treatment in OMT. Opioid users in general are often in need of several treatment episodes before achieving long‐term abstinence. It is therefore important that clinical practice facilitate a possible re‐start on XR‐NTX for those who express this need.

Further research should investigate post‐treatment efficacy and patients' willingness to re‐start XR‐NTX treatment after discontinuation, as induction of XR‐NTX is challenging. It is also important to explore factors that enable or prevent opioid users from achieving recovery and to maintain abstinence from opioids after treatment discontinuation. Increased knowledge of such factors may guide clinicians to tailor individual treatment trajectories in a more effective way.
