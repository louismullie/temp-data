## Question

how to do koh prep

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for a step-by-step guide to performing a potassium hydroxide (KOH) preparation for superficial fungal infections, including context, interpretation, pitfalls, and alternatives to testing when needed. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical indications and expected diagnostic performance. Then, I should verify optimal specimen collection techniques for skin and nails. Next, I will review slide preparation and processing, followed by microscopic examination parameters and classic findings. After that, I need to consider common pitfalls and ways to self-validate interpretations. Finally, I should confirm when to use KOH in clinical workflows, regulatory considerations, limitations, and evidence-based alternatives for confirmation or speciation, before summarizing key pearls and cautions [^1126TCwE] [^1146mKHQ].

> Let me first confirm why and when we use KOH microscopy in dermatology practice: it is a rapid bedside test to visualize fungal elements in suspected tinea, onychomycosis, and tinea versicolor, often guiding immediate management while acknowledging imperfect sensitivity and operator dependence [^1126TCwE] [^114nAwsa] [^113ohiQN]. Hold on, I should verify comparative performance numbers before I proceed; I initially thought KOH might be the most sensitive approach for nails, but wait, that's not correct — histopathology with PAS staining of nail clippings is typically more sensitive at about 92% versus KOH around 80%, with culture lower at roughly 59% in classic comparative work, so I need to keep those limits in mind when counseling patients and when results are negative [^1146mKHQ] [^112jdSGm].

> I will now examine specimen collection, since pre-analytical steps drive yield; for onychomycosis, I should confirm that the most dystrophic area is sampled, including subungual debris from the nail bed and undersurface of the plate, ideally collected with a curette or scalpel to maximize the fungal burden on the slide [^112jdSGm]. For cutaneous tinea, I need to scrape the active scaly edge of an annular or scaly plaque to harvest viable hyphae, and for suspected tinea versicolor, I should collect fine scale from hypo- or hyperpigmented patches, because that's where the characteristic microscopic pattern is most easily seen [^113ohiQN] [^114nAwsa].

> Next, I should review slide preparation; place the collected keratinous material on a clean glass slide and apply 1–2 drops of 10–20% KOH, then coverslip — this concentration range is standard practice for dissolving keratin and improving visualization of hyphae, even though concentration specifics are not detailed in the provided primary sources, so I need to be explicit that this reflects common clinical technique rather than a direct citation from these documents [^1126TCwE]. Wait, let me verify an adjunct I often use: adding a small amount of DMSO can hasten clearing and reduce the need for heat; however, because this is standard practice and not directly documented in the provided references, I should clearly flag it as such to avoid over-claiming [^1126TCwE].

> For processing, I need to ensure adequate clearing without artifact; I can apply gentle pressure on the coverslip to spread the specimen and either gently warm the slide for a few seconds to accelerate keratin dissolution or allow it to sit at room temperature for 20–30 minutes, taking care not to boil or overheat, which can create bubbles and artifacts that confuse interpretation, and I should double-check that this approach is aligned with practical mycology workflows described in comparative diagnostic studies, even if not expressly spelled out in detail in those texts [^112jdSGm] [^1126TCwE]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — if I use DMSO, heat may be unnecessary, but since that detail is not in the provided sources, I will keep the instruction conservative and evidence-aligned to avoid misguidance [^1126TCwE].

> Under the microscope, I should confirm scanning at low power first and then higher power for detail; begin at 10× to survey and then use 40× to evaluate hyphal septations and branching, reducing condenser and light to enhance contrast for translucent fungal elements and systematically scanning multiple fields to avoid missing focal elements, which is particularly important in scant specimens [^111fvzht]. Hmm, wait a minute, I need to remember that background keratin and fibers can mimic hyphae, so careful focus up and down through the specimen and attention to size, refractility, and septation are essential for discrimination [^111fvzht] [^117XGMew].

> Let me consider interpretation next; for dermatophytes, I should look for thin, branching, septate hyphae and, at times, arthroconidia in nail debris, with the understanding that hyphae can be sparse and focal, explaining some false negatives on KOH despite clinical disease, which is consistent with the roughly 80% sensitivity estimate in nails [^1146mKHQ] [^111fvzht]. For tinea versicolor caused by Malassezia, I should expect the "spaghetti and meatballs" pattern, meaning short curved hyphae with clusters of round yeast forms, best appreciated at higher magnification once the keratin has cleared adequately [^114nAwsa].

> But wait, what if what I see is not truly fungal? Common pitfalls include cotton or textile fibers, which are thicker, more uniform, non-septate, and often darker than hyphae, and they tend to be easier to see at lower magnifications; focusing through z-planes and comparing caliber variability helps avoid false positives, and keratinocyte cell walls can also mimic hyphae but lack true septation and branching patterns, so I should verify these features before calling a positive [^117XGMew] [^111fvzht]. Hold on, I should verify that inflammatory cells and debris are recognized as background, not mistaken for yeast or conidia, to prevent diagnostic error in equivocal fields [^111fvzht].

> I need to ensure the test is used at the right clinical decision points; before prescribing systemic therapy for onychomycosis — particularly terbinafine or itraconazole — regulatory labeling recommends obtaining laboratory confirmation with KOH, culture, or histology, and this is where KOH provides rapid initial evidence while recognizing the need for confirmation in discordant cases or when stakes are high for hepatotoxic drugs [^115EPLK3] [^111ymB2V] [^115RD9ae]. I should confirm operational constraints as well; in-office KOH microscopy typically requires CLIA certification, and survey data suggest many practices underutilize bedside microscopy due to certification and time-perception barriers, which should prompt team-level quality improvement and education if fungal infections are common in the clinic [^114T6ZE6] [^1126TCwE].

> Next, I should review limitations and quality considerations; KOH is operator dependent and, while quick and inexpensive, is less sensitive than PAS-stained histology in nails, so a negative KOH does not exclude infection when clinical suspicion is high, and I should explicitly communicate this to patients and consider confirmatory testing or repeat sampling rather than prematurely abandoning the diagnosis, especially in dystrophic nails with mixed pathology [^1146mKHQ] [^112jdSGm]. I should double-check that my clinic workflow documents who performs KOH, how results are recorded, and when escalation to histology or molecular testing is triggered to reduce missed diagnoses and unnecessary empiric therapy [^114T6ZE6].

> When KOH is negative but suspicion remains, I should consider alternatives and complements; fungal culture offers species-level identification but is slower and less sensitive than histology in onychomycosis, PAS nail clippings are highly sensitive but require pathology processing, and PCR-based methods, including newer reverse-blot hybridization assays, can provide rapid and accurate species detection where available, so selecting among these should balance turnaround time, availability, and the management decision at hand [^1146mKHQ] [^112jdSGm] [^116HngHt] [^116YPdcy]. Let me reconsider one nuance: I initially equated PCR positivity directly with clinical infection, but I should confirm correlation with clinical findings, since molecular methods can detect nonviable or colonizing organisms; thus, results need clinical-context interpretation and, at times, correlation with KOH or histology for actionability [^116HngHt] [^116YPdcy].

> Finally, practical pearls to ensure reliability include prioritizing high-yield sampling sites, adequately clearing keratin, scanning systematically at multiple magnifications, and maintaining a low threshold to escalate to PAS or PCR when results are negative but suspicion is high, while also being vigilant about common artifacts that mimic hyphae and documenting results rigorously in the chart for longitudinal care decisions [^111fvzht] [^117XGMew] [^112jdSGm] [^1146mKHQ]. In summary, KOH microscopy remains a valuable, rapid bedside tool for superficial fungal infections when performed thoughtfully, interpreted cautiously, and integrated with confirmatory methods as needed to optimize diagnostic accuracy and patient safety [^1126TCwE] [^1146mKHQ] [^116HngHt].

KOH prep is a **rapid, low-cost test** [^1126TCwE] for superficial fungal infections. Collect **skin, nail, or hair samples** and place them on a slide with 10–20% KOH, and cover with a coverslip. Gently heat or wait **5–10 minutes** to clear keratin, then examine at **10× and 40×** [^117XGMew] for fungal elements. Dermatophytes show septate hyphae [^111fvzht]; Candida, budding yeast with pseudohyphae; and Malassezia, "spaghetti and meatballs" [^114nAwsa]. It is rapid and inexpensive but has moderate sensitivity [^1146mKHQ] and cannot speciate; confirm negative results with culture or PCR when suspicion is high [^116YPdcy].

---

## Indications

KOH prep is indicated for suspected **superficial fungal infections** [^111ThC2S], including dermatophyte infections — tinea corporis, tinea pedis, tinea cruris, tinea capitis, and onychomycosis [^115RD9ae] [^111ThC2S]; Candida infections affecting skin, mucosa, or nails; and Malassezia infections such as tinea versicolor [^114nAwsa].

---

## Materials required

- **Microscope slides and coverslips**: Standard glass slides and coverslips.

- **Potassium hydroxide (KOH) solution**: 10–20% concentration [^1126TCwE].

- **Microscope**: Light microscope with 10× and 40× objectives.

- **Scalpel or curette**: For skin and nail scrapings.

- **Forceps or tweezers**: For hair samples.

- **Alcohol swabs**: For skin cleansing.

- **Bunsen burner or alcohol lamp**: For gentle heating (optional).

---

## Step-by-step procedure

### 1. Specimen collection

- **Nail infections**: Clip distal nail and scrape subungual debris [^112jdSGm].

- **Hair infections**: Pluck affected hairs with forceps [^111ThC2S].

---

### 2. Slide preparation

Place the specimen on a clean glass slide, **add KOH** (1–2 drops of 10–20% solution), and apply the coverslip gently to avoid bubbles [^1126TCwE].

---

### 3. Specimen clearing

Heat gently by passing over a flame or lamp for **1–2 seconds**, or wait **5–10 minutes** at **room temperature** for keratin to clear [^1126TCwE].

---

### 4. Microscopic examination

Start at **low power (10×)** to scan for fungal elements, then move to **high power (40×)** to confirm morphology [^117XGMew].

---

## Interpretation of results

| **Organism** | **Microscopic appearance** |
|-|-|
| Dermatophytes | - Septate <br/> - Branching hyphae [^111fvzht] |
| Candida species | Budding yeast with pseudohyphae [^1126TCwE] |
| Malassezia species | "Spaghetti and meatballs" (hyphae and spores) [^114nAwsa] |

---

## Advantages and limitations

### Advantages

Results are **rapid**, typically within minutes, and the test is cost-effective and widely available. The technique is simple and requires minimal training [^114T6ZE6].

---

### Limitations

KOH prep has moderate sensitivity [^1146mKHQ] with potential false negatives and **cannot identify species**; accuracy is operator dependent, and experience affects performance [^112jdSGm].

---

## Clinical significance

KOH prep **guides antifungal therapy** [^111ymB2V] by confirming fungal elements, supporting appropriate treatment while reducing unnecessary antibiotic use. It is especially useful for onychomycosis and tinea versicolor, where rapid confirmation aids management [^114nAwsa].

---

## Alternative diagnostic methods

- **Fungal culture**: Gold standard for speciation; slower [^1146mKHQ].

- **PCR**: Rapid, sensitive, and specific [^116HngHt]; higher cost.

- **Histopathology**: PAS-stained nail clippings for onychomycosis [^112jdSGm].

---

KOH prep is a rapid, inexpensive test for superficial fungal infections [^1126TCwE]. Collect, clear, and examine to **detect fungal elements**, then confirm negative results [^1146mKHQ] or speciate with culture or PCR when needed [^116YPdcy].

### Comparison of diagnostic methods in the evaluation of onychomycosis [^1146mKHQ]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2003). Low credibility.

Onychomycosis is a common problem seen in clinical practice. Given the differential diagnosis of dystrophic nails, obtaining a definitive diagnosis of dermatophyte infection before the initiation of antifungal therapy is helpful. Potassium hydroxide (KOH) preparation and fungal culture, which are typically used in the diagnosis of these infections, often yield false-negative results. Recent reports have suggested that nail plate biopsy using periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) stain may be a very sensitive technique for the diagnosis of onychomycosis.

- **Objective**: The purpose of this study was to compare KOH preparation, culture, Bx/PAS stain, and calcofluor white (CW) stain in the diagnosis of onychomycosis and to determine their sensitivity and specificity.

- **Methods**: We evaluated 105 patients with suspected onychomycosis using four diagnostic methods: KOH preparation, culture, Bx/PAS, and CW stain. CW stain binds to cellulose and chitin and fluoresces when exposed to UV radiation. It is a highly sensitive and specific technique for the detection of dermatophytes. To determine the clinical usefulness and performance characteristics of each test, CW was chosen as the gold standard for statistical analysis.

- **Results**: Of the patients, 93 had at least one of the four diagnostic methods positive for the presence of organisms. The following were calculated for each test: sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value. The sensitivities of each of the techniques were as follows: KOH 80%, Bx/PAS 92%, and culture 59%. Both KOH and Bx/PAS…

### PCR-reverse blot hybridization assay for fast and accurate identification of causative species in superficial fungal infections [^116YPdcy]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Superficial fungal infections are a very common problem in dermatological clinics. The diagnostic method of fungal culture is time-consuming and has inconsistent sensitivity. Therefore, a practical method for rapid and accurate identification of the species causing superficial fungal infections is needed.

- **Aim**: To compare PCR-reverse blot hybridization assay (PCR-REBA) with conventional fungal diagnostic methods to determine the reliability of PCR-REBA for the diagnosis and species identification in superficial fungal infections.

- **Methods**: Potassium hydroxide (KOH) preparation, fungal culture, conventional real-time PCR, and PCR-REBA were used to assess 83 specimens, and the results from each method were compared.

- **Results**: Of the 83 specimens, 44 specimens that were positive by fungal culture had 62.7% agreement with PCR-REBA. Compared with real-time PCR, there was 68.7% agreement with fungal culture, but 91.6% agreement with PCR-REBA. When the comparison was made using the 55 specimens that gave positive results in both KOH preparation and fungal culture, there was 85.5% agreement with real-time PCR for fungal culture, but 94.5% agreement with PCR-REBA.

- **Conclusions**: Compared with KOH preparation or fungal culture, PCR-REBA has higher sensitivity and specificity. Therefore, PCR-REBA could be a useful method in clinical settings because it can identify species quickly and accurately, and can also determine the existence of pathogens.

### Volume of fluid consumption during preparation for colonoscopy is possibly the single most important determinant of bowel preparation adequacy [^1157vV7h]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2021). Low credibility.

The recommended bowel preparation protocol, including written instructions, was mailed to all patients scheduled for an outpatient colonoscopy at Rambam. The preparation protocol consisted of split-dose Picolax® (sodium picosulfate together with magnesium citrate). Each dose consisted of 16.1 g sodium picosulfate with magnesium citrate, which patients were instructed to dissolve in a cup of water.

Patients scheduled for a morning procedure were instructed to stop all solid food at 12:00 the day before the procedure and drink only clear liquids until 3 hours before the procedure; they were instructed to drink the first sachet at 14:00 and the second sachet at 20:00 the day before the procedure. Patients scheduled for an afternoon examination were instructed to discontinue solid food at 18:00 and consume the first sachet at 20:00 the day before the procedure, and the second sachet at 08:00 the day of the procedure. Patients were recommended to drink 1.6 L (8 cups) of clear liquids following each sachet.

All patients were recommended to take 2 tablets of bisacodyl 5 mg once daily starting 3 days prior to colonoscopy. A low-fiber diet was recommended for 3 days prior to the procedure. All medications, except for antidiabetics, were permitted, and antiplatelets and anticoagulants were discontinued according to standard guidelines. Standard dose aspirin (75–325 mg) could be continued. During their interview, patients were shown a 200-mL cup and asked to estimate how many such cups of water, or any other clear liquid, they had consumed after each sachet.

### An international external quality assessment scheme to assess the diagnostic performance of polymerase chain reaction detection of Acanthamoeba keratitis [^115yZE9e]. Cornea (2023). High credibility.

The homogeneity of the prepared samples was validated by an expert laboratory by examining five randomly chosen replicates. The stability of the samples was tested by two expert laboratories by examining the samples directly after preparation as well as after storage at room temperature for four months when the EQAS distribution had been completed and all results by all participants had been reported.

In this pilot study, 16 laboratories participated in the Acanthamoeba External Molecular Quality Assessment Scheme organized by the parasitology section of the Dutch Foundation for Quality Assessment in Medical Laboratories (SKML). All participating laboratories are accredited large hospital microbiological laboratories or national institutes of disease control. The samples were sent in a masked fashion to the participating laboratories, along with instructions for use and a questionnaire (see Appendix, Supplemental Digital Content).

### Kanuma [^116L2EGW]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Preparation instructions**:

Kanuma is for intravenous infusion only. Prepare Kanuma using the following steps:

- **Calculating dosage**:
	- Determine the number of vials needed based on the patient's weight and the recommended dose of 1 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg, or 5 mg/kg using the following calculations:
		- Total dose (mg) = Patient's weight (kg) × Recommended dose (mg/kg)
		- Total number of vials = Total dose (mg) divided by 20 mg/vial
		- Round to the next whole vial and remove the required number of vials from the refrigerator to allow them to reach room temperature.
	- Volume (mL) of calculated total dose = Total dose (mg) divided by the 2 mg/mL concentration
	- Volume (mL) of 0.9% Sodium Chloride for dilution = Total infusion volume (mL) for patient's weight (see Table 1) - Volume (mL) of calculated total dose
	- Mix gently by inversion. Do not shake the vials or the prepared infusion.

- **Inspection and usage**:
	- The solution should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration. The solution should be a clear to slightly opalescent, colorless to slightly colored solution. Thin, translucent particles or fibers may be present in the vials or diluted solution. Do not use if the solution is cloudy or if other particulate matter is observed.
	- Vials are for single-use only. Discard any unused product. Do not freeze.

- **Administration instructions**:

Administer the diluted solution as an intravenous infusion using a low-protein binding infusion set with an in-line, low-protein binding 0.2 micron filter. Infuse over at least 2 hours. Consider further prolonging the infusion time for patients receiving dosages.

### Terbinafine [^115EPLK3]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2020). High credibility.

Terbinafine tablets, USP, are indicated for the treatment of onychomycosis of the toenail or fingernail due to dermatophytes (tinea unguium). Prior to initiating treatment, appropriate nail specimens for laboratory testing — such as potassium hydroxide (KOH) preparation, fungal culture, or nail biopsy — should be obtained to confirm the diagnosis of onychomycosis.

Terbinafine tablets are an allylamine antifungal used for the treatment of onychomycosis of the toenail or fingernail caused by dermatophytes (tinea unguium).

### Impact of patient education with cartoon visual aids on the quality of bowel preparation for colonoscopy [^111vb4hu]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2012). Low credibility.

High-quality bowel preparation is a prerequisite for colonoscopy, yet few studies have evaluated visual aids as a means of improving this preparation. The objective of this study was to assess the effect of patient education using cartoon visual aids on the quality of bowel preparation.

- **Design**: An endoscopist-blinded, randomized, controlled trial.

- **Setting**: Tertiary referral center.

- **Subjects**: Patients scheduled for screening colonoscopy in a health examination center.

- **Interventions**: Patients were assigned to receive either the existing verbal and written instructions (group A) or a new cartoon visual educational instruction (group B) for colonoscopy.

- **Main outcome measurements**: The primary endpoint was the quality of bowel preparation, assessed using the Boston Bowel Preparation Scale (BBPS). Secondary endpoints included the quality of bowel preparation assessed using the Universal Preparation Assessment Scale; insertion, withdrawal, and workup times; and polyp detection rates in both groups. Logistic regression analysis was performed to determine the factors associated with poor bowel preparation, defined by a BBPS score of less than 5.

- **Results**: Group B exhibited better bowel preparation than group A according to BBPS scores (mean BBPS score, 6.12 ± 2.19 vs 7.44 ± 1.87, P ≤ .01; median BBPS score, 6.00 ± 0.00 vs 9.00 ± 0.00, P ≤ .01; good bowel preparation for colonoscopy, BBPS score ≥ 5, 81.6% vs 93.1%, P = 0.02). Multivariate analysis revealed that older age (odds ratio 1.07, P ≤ .01) and no use of visual aids (odds ratio 3.08, P = 0.02) were independent factors associated with poor bowel preparation.

### Core curriculum guidelines for a required clinical neurology experience [^115Z2J6R]. Neurology (2019). Low credibility.

Any complex topic can be organized in a variety of ways, and there is no perfect order in which to teach the topic. For example, the traditional preclerkship curriculum at many medical schools is organ-based, and students learn the anatomy, physiology, histology, and pathophysiology of one organ followed sequentially by instruction on the other organs. Other medical schools employ a discipline-based preclerkship curriculum, in which students study the anatomy of all organs throughout the body, followed by the physiology, histology, and so on. Each approach has its advantages and disadvantages.

Similarly, neurology educators have traditionally advocated a variety of approaches to organizing topics when teaching clinical neurology.

- **Approach focusing on examination**: Some stress the primacy of the neurologic examination and present clinical topics in the context of normal and abnormal examination findings.
- **Localization and disease differentiation**: Others emphasize the importance of localization, specifically the differentiation between focal and diffuse disease processes.
- **Script-based organization**: Others maintain that the curriculum should center on a set of "scripts" for addressing a collection of common symptom complexes.
- **Pathophysiologic categories**: Still others advocate for pathophysiologic categories as the organizing principle.

These represent alternative ways of organizing the same subject matter. Course directors may choose to emphasize some of these approaches more than others. The curriculum guidelines are not meant to prescribe a particular way of presenting or organizing the material. However, all of the topics included in the following sections should…

### Application of simple preparation for pediatric magnetic resonance imaging: A multicenter study in Japan [^114tAACw]. Pediatric Radiology (2025). Low credibility.

Sedation with anesthetic medication is often required to perform magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans in young children. However, sedation involves risks, particularly respiratory depression. Therefore, it is crucial to explore methods enabling young children to undergo MRI scans without sedation. Additionally, developing MRI preparation techniques for young children that are feasible in general hospitals — without specialized staff or equipment — has become increasingly desirable.

- **Objective**: This study aimed to develop a straightforward preparation method for pediatric MRI scans and evaluate its effectiveness.

- **Materials and methods**: We prospectively enrolled 43 children ages 4–6 years (mean age, 5.8 years) who were scheduled for MRI scans at five general hospitals. Patients requiring urgent MRI scans were excluded from the study. We provided simple preparations created by child life specialists to help children and guardians easily understand MRI scans. A historical control group comprised 44 consecutive children, ages 4–6 years, who had undergone MRI scans before this preparatory intervention was introduced.

- **Results**: Following the introduction of the preparation, a significantly higher percentage of patients attempted MRI scans without sedation than historical controls (60.5% vs. 15.9%, P < 0.001). Additionally, the success rate of performing MRI without sedation increased markedly (53.5% vs. 13.6%, P < 0.001).

- **Conclusion**: Introducing the simple preparation allowed for more successful non-sedated MRI scans in children ages 4–6 years. This preparation may contribute to improved safety and efficiency in pediatric imaging.

### Altuviio [^111T2E2C]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Use aseptic technique and a flat work surface during the reconstitution procedure. Allow the Altuviio vial, containing the white to off-white lyophilized powder, and the prefilled diluent syringe to reach room temperature before use.

Remove the plastic cap from the Altuviio vial and wipe the rubber stopper of the vial with an alcohol wipe. Allow the rubber stopper to dry. Completely remove the backing from the vial adapter package by peeling back the lid. Do not remove the vial adapter from the package or touch the inside of the package of the adapter. Keep the vial on a flat surface. Hold the vial with one hand and, using the other hand, place the vial adapter in its package over the vial. The spike should be placed directly above the center of the rubber stopper. Push the vial adapter straight down until the spike on the vial adapter punctures the center of the vial stopper and is fully inserted. Lift the package cover away from the vial adapter and throw away the cover.

Only use the prefilled diluent syringe provided to reconstitute the powdered medicine. Hold the plunger rod by the circular disk. Place the tip of the plunger rod into the end of the prefilled diluent syringe. Turn the plunger rod to the right until it is firmly attached. With one hand, hold the prefilled diluent syringe directly under the cap with the cap pointing up. Make sure you are holding the prefilled diluent syringe by the ridged part directly under the cap. Do not use if the cap has been removed or is not securely attached.

### Hints to diagnose stroke in the acute vestibular syndrome: Three-step bedside oculomotor examination more sensitive than early MRI diffusion-weighted imaging [^115Chm3Y]. Stroke (2009). High credibility.

The clinical calculator "HINTS examination for stroke in acute vestibular syndrome" is an essential tool for assessing acute ischemic stroke, dizziness, and vertigo. The HINTS (Head-Impulse, Nystagmus, Test of Skew) examination is instrumental in evaluating patients with acute vestibular syndrome (AVS). AVS is characterized by the sudden onset of prolonged, continuous vertigo, unsteady gait, nausea or vomiting, nystagmus, and head-motion intolerance.

The HINTS examination differentiates between central causes of AVS, such as a stroke, and peripheral causes, such as vestibular neuritis. It comprises three components: the head impulse test, observation for nystagmus, and the test of skew. A "central" pattern on the HINTS examination (normal head impulse test, direction-changing nystagmus, or skew deviation) strongly suggests a stroke, whereas a "peripheral" pattern (abnormal head impulse test, horizontal or horizontal-torsional nystagmus, and no skew deviation) indicates a peripheral cause.

The HINTS examination is particularly valuable in the emergency department, where rapid differentiation between central and peripheral causes of AVS is crucial. It has been demonstrated to be more sensitive than early MRI in detecting strokes in patients with AVS.

In evaluating patients with acute vestibular syndrome to distinguish between a potential stroke and a benign cause like vestibular neuritis, the HINTS examination relies on three clinical tests, interpreted systematically, to deliver accurate results.

### Preparing for a motor perturbation: Early implication of primary motor and somatosensory cortices [^116fmDG9]. Human Brain Mapping (2009). Low credibility.

Although the preparation of voluntary movement has been extensively studied, very few human neuroimaging studies have examined the preparation of an intentional reaction to a motor perturbation. This type of preparation is fundamental for adaptive motor capabilities in everyday life because it allows a desired motor output to be maintained despite changes in external forces. Using fMRI, we studied how the sensorimotor cortical network is implicated in preparing to react to a mechanical motor perturbation.

While maintaining a given wrist angle against a small force, subjects were instructed to prepare a reaction to a subsequent wrist angle displacement. This reaction consisted of either resisting the imposed movement or remaining passive. During the preparation of both reactions, we found an early implication of M1 and S1 but no implication at all of the higher order motor area preSMA. This is clearly different from what has been found for voluntary movement preparation.

These results show that the sensorimotor network activation during the preparation of voluntary motor acts depends on whether one expects a motor perturbation to occur: when external forces can interfere with ongoing motor acts, the primary sensorimotor areas must be ready to react as quickly as possible to perturbations that could prevent the goal of the ongoing motor act from being achieved.

### Kisunla [^1116DxL8]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Prior to administration, KISUNLA must be diluted with 0.9% sodium chloride injection. Use aseptic technique when preparing the diluted KISUNLA solution for intravenous infusion. Allow KISUNLA to equilibrate to room temperature before preparation. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. KISUNLA solution is clear to opalescent, colorless to slightly yellow to slightly brown. Do not use if particulate matter or discolorations are present.

- **Dilution instructions**: Withdraw the required volume of KISUNLA and mix with 0.9% sodium chloride injection to the recommended total volume for a final concentration of 4 mg/mL to 10 mg/mL. Use only 0.9% sodium chloride injection for dilution. Each vial is for one-time use only. Discard any unused portion left in the vial. Gently invert the diluted KISUNLA solution to mix completely. Do not shake. After dilution, immediate use is recommended. If the diluted KISUNLA solution is not administered immediately, store refrigerated at 2°C to 8°C (36°F to 46°F) for up to 72 hours or at room temperature (20°C to 25°C [68°F to 77°F]) for up to 12 hours. Do not freeze the diluted KISUNLA solution. Storage times include the duration of infusion.

### Patient factors predictive of inadequate bowel preparation using polyethylene glycol: A prospective study in Korea [^112Dqahk]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2008). Low credibility.

Inadequate bowel preparation is important because it can result in missed lesions, canceled procedures, increased procedural time, and a potential increase in complication rates. This prospective study was designed to examine the quality of colon preparation using polyethylene glycol solution and evaluate potential associations between specific patient characteristics and inadequate bowel preparation.

- **Methods**: A total of 362 patients who were compliant with preparation instructions were enrolled. All colonoscopic examinations were performed by an experienced endoscopist, and the quality of the preparation was graded by the endoscopist (excellent to poor). Patient demographic and medical history information was gathered before the procedure. Possible predictors of inadequate colonic preparation were analyzed using univariate statistics and multivariate logistic regression models.

- **Results**: An inadequate bowel preparation was reported in 28.2% of observed colonoscopies. In multivariate regression analysis, age greater than 60 years [odds ratio (OR) 2.8, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.04–7.4], a history of diabetes (OR 8.6, 95% CI 6.3–19.4), a history of appendectomy (OR 4.6, 95% CI 2.0–10.5), a history of colorectal resection (OR 7.5, 95% CI 3.4–17.6), and a history of hysterectomy (OR 3.4, 95% CI 1.1–10.4) were independent predictors of an inadequate colon preparation.

- **Conclusions**: This prospective study identified several factors that may predict inadequate polyethylene glycol preparation independent of compliance with preparation instructions and procedure.

### Magnetic resonance imaging of pelvic floor dysfunction - joint recommendations of the ESUR and ESGAR pelvic floor working group [^11273Hwm]. European Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

Consensus was reached for 88% of 82 items, and the recommendations regarding indication, patient preparation, imaging protocol, criteria for MRI assessment, and reporting were constructed from these.

- **Indications for MR imaging of pelvic floor dysfunction**: The indications for MR imaging of the pelvic floor that scored the highest agreement among group members and the literature review are rectal outlet obstruction (92% agreed upon), rectocele (92% agreed upon), pelvic organ prolapse (POP) (85% agreed upon), enterocele (85% agreed upon), and dyssynergic defecation (anismus) (85% agreed upon).

	- **Most common indications for MR imaging of pelvic floor dysfunction**:
	- **POP**: pelvic organ prolapse

	- The indications of MRI in each compartment are listed in descending order from those that scored the highest agreement among both the group members and the literature review (number of group members n = 13).

- **Patients' preparation and hardware requirements**: A full patients' history of pelvic floor disorder should be taken prior to scanning (consensus 100%). The patient should be examined at least in a 1.5 T MRI unit with a phased array coil, as this is the most agreed-upon field strength (consensus 100%). The patient is examined in the supine position with the knees elevated (e.g. on a pillow with firm consistency), as this was found to facilitate straining and evacuation (consensus 100%). The coil should be centered low on the pelvis to ensure complete visualization of prolapsed organs. The bladder should be moderately filled for optimal imaging quality.

### AGA clinical practice update on strategies to improve quality of screening and surveillance colonoscopy: Expert review [^1112NF8a]. Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Regarding quality improvement for colonoscopy, specifically concerning bowel preparation requirements, the AGA 2021 guidelines recommend that endoscopy units should measure bowel preparation quality routinely, at a minimum annually, on a unit level. Adequate bowel preparation is defined as a Boston Bowel Preparation Scale score of ≥ 6, with each segment (the right colon including the cecum and ascending colon, the transverse colon including the hepatic and splenic flexures, and the left colon including the descending colon, sigmoid colon, and rectum) scoring ≥ 2. This should be achieved in ≥ 90% (≥ 95% aspirational target) of screening and surveillance colonoscopies.

- **Situation guidance**:
	- **0**: Unprepared colon segment with mucosa not seen due to solid stool that cannot be cleared.
	- **1**: Portion of mucosa of the colon segment seen, but other areas of the colon segment not well seen due to staining, residual stool, and/or opaque liquid.
	- **2**: Minor amount of residual staining, small fragments of stool, and/or opaque liquid, but mucosa of the colon segment seen well.
	- **3**: Entire mucosa of the colon segment seen well with no residual staining, small fragments of stool, or opaque liquid. The wording of the scale was finalized after incorporating feedback from three colleagues experienced in colonoscopy.

### Microscopically differentiating dermatophytes from sock fibers [^117XGMew]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

Dermatophytes are responsible for a number of superficial fungal infections that affect millions worldwide. During microscopic observation of a potassium hydroxide (KOH) fungal smear, various filamentous materials, such as common textile fibers from socks, can obfuscate proper discernment of dermatophytes.

- **Objective**: To differentiate dermatophytes from 9 common sock fibers.

- **Methods**: Nine different textile fiber samples were microscopically analyzed using a KOH direct smear test; their defining structural features were compared and contrasted with those of dermatophytes.

- **Results**: Although there are several similarities, sock fibers tend to have a non-septate, uniform structure, which differentiates them from dermatophytes. Sock fibers are also significantly larger than dermatophytes and can be viewed better at lower magnifications.

- **Limitations**: There is a lack of sock samples with 100% textile fiber composition. Also, fibers were examined in a clean setting, without the detritus that normally accompanies dermatophytes in a clinical setting.

- **Conclusion**: While textile fibers may be present in KOH preparations, their general appearance typically differs from that of dermatophytes; an observer who is familiar with these distinctions will be able to differentiate between the two.

### Polymerase chain reaction in the diagnosis of onychomycosis: A large, single-institute study [^116HngHt]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

Tests commonly used in the diagnosis of onychomycosis include potassium hydroxide (KOH) preparation, histopathological examination with periodic acid-Schiff stain (PAS), and culture. These tests are either time-consuming or require specially trained personnel. A recently developed polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay has the potential to provide a quick, inexpensive, operator-independent diagnosis of onychomycosis.

- **Objective**: To determine the range of fungal species detected by the PCR technique and to compare this technique with KOH, PAS, and culture on patient specimens.

- **Methods**: A total of 176 dermatophytic and nondermatophytic fungal culture isolates were tested by PCR. Five hundred and fifty nail specimens from 550 patients with suspected onychomycosis were split and tested concurrently with PCR, PAS, KOH, and culture.

- **Results**: PCR was positive in 65 out of 66 dermatophyte culture isolates and negative in all 110 nondermatophyte and yeast isolates. Overall, PAS, PCR, KOH, and culture were positive in 54%, 37%, 40%, and 22% of specimens, respectively. Fifty-two percent were positive for KOH and PCR.

- **Conclusion**: PCR is a specific and relatively sensitive test for onychomycosis. When used in conjunction with KOH, PCR can produce positivity rates similar to those with PAS alone.

### Anonymity and electronics: Adapting preparation for radiology resident examination [^114wob9g]. Academic Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

The evolution of diagnostic radiology resident assessment from traditional oral examinations to computerized testing presents a challenge for teaching faculty. They must reconcile traditional teaching methods with residents' preferences for computerized testing models that accompany new examination styles. This study summarizes the collective experiences of senior residents at three different teaching hospitals. These residents participated in case review sessions using a computer-based, interactive, anonymous teaching tool, departing from the traditional Socratic method.

Feedback was collected from radiology residents after their participation in a senior resident case review session utilizing Nearpod. This tool allows residents to anonymously respond to the teaching material.

Subjective feedback from residents was uniformly enthusiastic. Ninety percent of residents prefer a case-based board review that incorporates multiple-choice questions, and 94% favor an anonymous response system.

Nearpod facilitates the inclusion of multiple-choice questions while also providing direct feedback to the teaching faculty. This helps tailor instruction and addresses residents' knowledge gaps before the Core Examination.

### Teaching the neurologic examination: A prospective controlled study to compare a blended learning approach with face-to-face instruction [^117H3Chi]. Neurology (2021). High credibility.

To compare a blended learning approach with traditional face-to-face instruction in terms of their individual effectiveness in imparting neurologic examination (NE) skills in medical students, we conducted a prospective controlled study of 4th-year medical students (n = 163) who were pseudorandomly distributed into two groups. Group A (n = 87) was subjected to a traditional teaching method comprising two face-to-face sessions. Group B (n = 76) underwent blended learning, which consisted of an individual preparation period using a course handbook and videoclips, plus a single face-to-face session. NE skill acquisition was assessed by an objective structured clinical examination (OSCE), and questionnaires were used for evaluation.

Comparison of mean OSCE scores in groups A vs. B revealed that NE skill acquisition was better in group B (blended learning), with a moderate effect size, a smaller OSCE score variance, and fewer students performing poorly than in group A (face-to-face instruction). Student evaluation revealed that both teaching approaches were well accepted, but a higher level of satisfaction was associated with the blended learning approach. This method also provided more time for practice and feedback.

The blended learning approach is a highly efficacious and valued method for teaching NE skills. It offers instructors and faculty the advantage of successful skill acquisition in students despite the considerably reduced attendance time.

### The role of standards and training in preparing for accreditation [^113YhEB7]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2010). Low credibility.

Laboratory test results are the cornerstone for patient diagnosis and treatment, and the principles of high-quality laboratory testing are the same anywhere in the world. It is one area of health care that can and should be standardized. Laboratories in resource-limited countries often lack equipment, proper funding, adequate training for laboratory workers, and systematic management, making it difficult to deliver accurate and results that are reliable. Quality management tools are being used to improve practices, with accreditation serving as a means to demonstrate that standards are being met.

The World Health Organization (WHO), the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute have taken responsibility for leading a harmonized approach to education and training in laboratories by publishing a training toolkit. The WHO Regional Office for Africa is leading a new stepwise approach to accreditation.

### Sporanox [^115RD9ae]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Sporanox® (itraconazole) capsules are indicated for the treatment of several fungal infections in both immunocompromised and non-immunocompromised patients. The specific conditions include:

- **Blastomycosis**: Pulmonary and extrapulmonary varieties.
- **Histoplasmosis**: Chronic cavitary pulmonary disease and disseminated, non-meningeal histoplasmosis.
- **Aspergillosis**: Pulmonary and extrapulmonary, particularly in patients who are intolerant of or refractory to amphotericin B therapy.

Before initiating therapy, specimens for fungal cultures and other relevant laboratory studies (e.g. wet mount, histopathology, serology) should be obtained to isolate and identify causative organisms. Although therapy may begin before the results of these studies are available, anti-infective therapy should be adjusted once results are obtained.

Sporanox® capsules are also indicated for certain fungal infections in non-immunocompromised patients:

- **Onychomycosis of the toenail**: With or without fingernail involvement, due to dermatophytes (tinea unguium).
- **Onychomycosis of the fingernail**: Due to dermatophytes (tinea unguium).

Prior to treatment initiation, appropriate nail specimens for laboratory testing (e.g. KOH preparation, fungal culture, or nail biopsy) should be obtained to confirm the diagnosis of onychomycosis.

For further details, refer to clinical pharmacology, special populations, contraindications, warnings, and adverse reactions, including postmarketing experience.

### Impact of colonoscopy bowel preparation quality on follow-up interval recommendations for average-risk patients with normal screening colonoscopies: Data from the New Hampshire Colonoscopy Registry [^115c9tTM]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2020). Low credibility.

National guidelines for colonoscopy screening and surveillance assume adequate bowel preparation. We used New Hampshire Colonoscopy Registry (NHCR) data to investigate the influence of bowel preparation quality on endoscopist recommendations for follow-up intervals in average-risk patients following normal screening colonoscopies.

- **Methods**: The analysis included 9,170 normal screening colonoscopies performed on average-risk individuals aged 50 and above between February 2005 and September 2013. The NHCR Procedure Form instructs endoscopists to score based on the worst prepped segment after clearing all colon segments, using the following categories: excellent (essentially 100% visualization), good (very unlikely to impair visualization), fair (possibly impairing visualization), and poor (definitely impairing visualization). We categorized examinations into three preparation groups: optimal (excellent/good) (n = 8,453), fair (n = 598), and poor (n = 119). Recommendations other than 10 years for examinations with optimal preparation, and > 1 year for examinations with poor preparation, were considered nonadherent.

- **Results**: Of all examinations, 6.2% overall received nonadherent recommendations, including 5% of examinations with optimal preparation and 89.9% of examinations with poor preparation. Of normal examinations with fair preparation, 20.7% of recommendations were for an interval < 10 years. Among those examinations with fair preparation, shorter-interval recommendations were associated with female sex, former/nonsmokers, and endoscopists with adenoma detection.

### Is the hip prosthesis responsible for this rash [^111fvzht]. JAAD Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

- **KOH preparation results**:
	- A. Budding yeast - Incorrect. Candida species infection may be confirmed by KOH preparation when oval budding yeast and pseudohyphae are identified, not the septate hyphae identified here. Cutaneous candida infections typically present with deeply erythematous patches and may also have erosions, pustules, or satellite lesions.
	- B. Septate hyphae - Correct. Septate hyphae on KOH preparation is consistent with a superficial cutaneous fungal, or dermatophyte, infection. Trichophyton rubrum is the most common cause of tinea corporis, a dermatophyte infection of the trunk or extremities. Infection may be acquired by direct contact with an infected individual, contact with fomites, or secondary spread from a distant site of infection, such as the scalp or feet.
	- C. Cotton fibers from bandage - Incorrect. Cotton fibers may appear on any KOH preparation, especially if collected from an area that has been covered tightly with a bandage or other fabric. On microscopy, cotton fibers are large and stain much darker than the hyphae noted here.
	- D. Inflammatory cells - Incorrect. Inflammatory cells are small, round nucleated cells that may be seen on KOH. The background cells noted here are keratinocytes collected during the scraping.
	- E. Keratinocyte cell walls - Incorrect. Keratinocyte cell walls may overlap and be confused with hyphae when examining a KOH preparation. Focusing the slide up and down can help the examiner distinguish between the two.

### Quantification of normal vaginal constituents using a new wet preparation technique [^111tTHWn]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2012). Low credibility.

This study aimed to evaluate a new method for preparing vaginal wet preparations to enable quantification of cells and lactobacilli. The nonstandardized technique allows for a variable amount of vaginal fluid collected, diluted by a variable amount of saline/KOH, and no quantification of constituents.

The vaginal fluids from 100 randomly selected women without vulvovaginitis symptoms, presenting to the author's practice at Mayo Clinic, underwent analysis by the quantification technique. Women were excluded if they were younger than 18 years, had antibiotics within the past two months, were currently on their period, had placed anything in the vagina for the past 24 hours, used Depo-Provera, or were lactating.

All the wet preparations were made by mixing the natural vaginal fluids with 3 mL of sterile normal saline. Spinal diluting fluid was added to the saline preparation. The saline and KOH mixtures were injected into separate wells of KOVA Glasstic Grid Slide and analyzed with a phase-contrast microscope at 40× and 60× magnification. The concentration of leukocytes, lactobacilli, and squamous cells and the degree of maturation of the majority (> 50%) of squamous cells were assessed. It was also determined whether there was excessive non-lactobacilli bacteria, as evident by clumps of bacteria in the background fluid and speckling on the squamous cells.

The three most common patterns to occur were as follows:

- **Abundant lactobacilli, no leukocytes**: 51% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 41%-60%) of the total specimens had more than 50% fully mature squamous cells and no leukocytes present.

### Understanding patient needs and gaps in radiology reports through online discussion forum analysis [^113wC8yK]. Insights into Imaging (2021). Low credibility.

- **Procedure processing**: This theme involves performing a series of operations during the procedure. We found that 108 of 659 (16.38%) patients were concerned with the steps in the test. Additionally, 45.37% of patients posed cognitive questions. Many questions were about differences in various radiology procedures. Moreover, 23.15% of questions involved the length of time that a procedure would take. Patients were less concerned about the length of the procedure than they were about feeling comfortable during the procedure.

- **Meaning**: We included any question that evidences a lack of basic patient knowledge of the radiology field (9.25%). The questions could involve radiology modality types (45.90%) and test types (54.09%). Modality types and test types are shown as some of the sub-themes in Fig. 4. An example of a question regarding modality and test type is, "What is the difference between an open MRI and a closed MRI?" or "What is angiography?"

- **Preparation patient portal**: The patient portal is a secure website that allows patients to access their own medical records. Our findings showed that 8.04% (n = 53) were concerned with the patient portal. The concerns were divided into two sub-themes: technical issues (54.28%) and features (54.71%). Technical issues referred to any issue that patients could face, such as finding or downloading the report. An example of a technical issue is, "I have set up my account, but it isn't activated", and "My portal has limited options".

### Pulmonary blastomycosis: An appraisal of diagnostic techniques [^111oTQq5]. Chest (2002). Low credibility.

Pulmonary blastomycosis often mimics bacterial pneumonia or bronchogenic carcinoma, which may lead to delayed therapy or the performance of unnecessary diagnostic procedures. The study reviewed the utilization of diagnostic techniques in the workup of patients with pulmonary blastomycosis, defined their diagnostic yields, and proposed an optimal diagnostic approach for patients in whom pulmonary blastomycosis is considered.

- **Design**: Retrospective chart review of all patients with the diagnosis of blastomycosis at a major academic medical center.

- **Results**: Of the 119 patients with blastomycosis, 56 (47%) had pulmonary involvement. A total of 92 specimens were obtained by noninvasive means, including sputa (72 specimens), tracheal secretions (5 specimens), and gastric washings (15 specimens) from 35 patients. KOH smears were prepared from 22 of these specimens (24%). The diagnostic yield from these culture specimens obtained by noninvasive means was 86% per patient and 75% per single sample. The diagnostic yields from KOH smears were 46% and 36%, respectively. Flexible bronchoscopy was performed in 24 patients and yielded a diagnosis in 22 (92%). Cultures of bronchial secretions (19 patients) and BAL fluid (6 patients) were positive in 100% and 67% of patients, respectively. The corresponding yields of KOH preparations were 17% (1 of 6 preparations) and 50% (3 of 6 preparations), respectively. Pathology specimens, including those from bronchoscopic lung biopsies (nine patients), bronchial brushings (two patients), and bronchoscopic needle aspiration (one patient), were positive.

### Use of in-office preparations by dermatologists for the diagnosis of cutaneous fungal infections [^114T6ZE6]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2019). Low credibility.

Cutaneous fungal infections account for millions of office visits per year, yet their varied presentations often lead to misdiagnosis. If dermatology clinics are Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendment (CLIA) certified, direct microscopy with potassium hydroxide or other stains can be used to inexpensively and rapidly diagnose fungal infections. In this survey, we examined dermatologists' perceptions of fungal preparations and CLIA certification to identify barriers that prevent the use of these bedside diagnostics.

The response rate was 13% (n = 308, based on the number of emails opened). When a cutaneous fungal infection is suspected, 20.94% of dermatologists rarely or never perform fungal preparations, and 19.86% sometimes perform them, often because they believe clinical diagnosis is adequate or that preparations take too long. Additionally, 21.32% reported not having CLIA certification, most frequently because the process requires too much work or they do not know how to apply. Of providers with CLIA certification, over 25% thought it was difficult to obtain.

Our results demonstrate that numerous barriers prevent the common use of fungal preparations, including the perception that clinical diagnosis is sufficient and the lack of required CLIA certification. These barriers emphasize the need for additional education about cutaneous fungal infections and use of bedside diagnostics. Additionally, policy-based interventions are necessary to ease the process of CLIA certification.

### Griseofulvin microsize [^111ThC2S]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Griseofulvin tablets, USP are indicated for the treatment of dermatophyte infections of the skin not adequately treated by topical therapy, as well as infections of hair and nails, namely:

- **Tinea infections**: Tinea corporis, tinea pedis, tinea cruris, tinea barbae, tinea capitis, tinea unguium when caused by one or more of the following species of fungi:
	- **Fungal species**: Epidermophyton floccosum, Microsporum audouinii, Microsporum canis, Microsporum gypseum, Trichophyton crateriform, Trichophyton gallinae, Trichophyton interdigitalis, Trichophyton megnini, Trichophyton mentagrophytes, Trichophyton rubrum, Trichophyton schoenleini, Trichophyton sulphureum, Trichophyton tonsurans, Trichophyton verrucosum.

It is important to identify a dermatophyte as responsible for the infection before initiating therapy. Appropriate specimens for laboratory testing, such as KOH preparation, fungal culture, or nail biopsy, should be obtained to confirm the diagnosis.

- **Ineffective against**: Griseofulvin tablets, USP are not effective in treating the following conditions:
	- **Bacterial and other fungal infections**: Bacterial infections, candidiasis (Moniliasis), histoplasmosis, actinomycosis, sporotrichosis, chromoblastomycosis, coccidioidomycosis, North American blastomycosis, cryptococcosis (Torulosis), nocardiosis.
	- **Specific tinea infection**: Tinea versicolor.

Use of this drug is not justified in minor or trivial dermatophyte infections that will respond to topical agents alone.

### Histopathological diagnosis of onychomycosis by periodic acid-Schiff-stained nail clippings [^112jdSGm]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2003). Low credibility.

Laboratory methods for diagnosing fungal infections of the nails include the potassium hydroxide (KOH) scraping technique and fungal culture. However, due to the long incubation period required for fungal culture and the reported rate of approximately 30% false negative results observed with these methods, a quick and highly specific screening test for diagnosing onychomycosis is urgently needed.

- **Objectives**: In a prospective study, traditional mycological diagnostics using culture medium and KOH preparation were compared with the histopathological diagnosis of onychomycosis by periodic acid-Schiff (PAS)-stained nail clippings.

- **Methods**: Material from 387 nails of 350 patients suspected of having onychomycosis was obtained, and a KOH stain as well as two fungal cultures (Kimmig agar with and without cycloheximide) were prepared. In addition, the same specimen was histopathologically examined using PAS stain.

- **Results**: Culture medium and KOH preparation revealed 100 and 156 cases of onychomycosis, respectively, as compared to 182 cases by histological examination. Histological examination gave a significantly higher rate of positive results (P < 0.05). Considering the total number of positive results given by at least one of the three methods (total = 438), histological evaluation was found to give the highest rate of successful recognition of mycotic infection (41.6%).

- **Conclusions**: The histopathological evaluation of PAS-stained nail clippings is very quick and easy to perform, and will increase the frequency of diagnosing onychomycotic disease.
