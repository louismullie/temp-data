## Question

How does diabetes mellitus influence the pathophysiology of trigger finger?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how diabetes mellitus influences the pathophysiology of trigger finger. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the baseline mechanics and histopathology of trigger finger itself. Then, I should examine diabetes-related biochemical drivers such as advanced glycation end-products and collagen cross-linking. Next, I will evaluate fibroproliferative signaling, microvascular dysfunction, and metabolic-hormonal contributors like hyperinsulinemia and IGF-1 signaling. After that, I need to integrate these into a unified model that explains epidemiology, severity, and outcomes in diabetes. Finally, I will cross-check dose-response data with HbA1c, reconcile conflicting treatment-outcome evidence, and consider clinical implications and limitations of the evidence base, making sure to correct any missteps along the way.

> Let me first confirm the baseline pathophysiology of trigger finger: it is a stenosing tenosynovitis centered at the A1 pulley where a mechanical mismatch develops between tendon and sheath due to thickening and narrowing, producing painful catching, locking, and impaired tendon gliding, with fibroproliferation and collagen remodeling as key microscopic features, and this provides the scaffold onto which diabetes-mediated processes can superimpose and amplify disease activity [^117S77ZB] [^113P2u6W].

> Now, I should review the diabetes-specific biochemical drivers, and AGEs are foremost: chronic hyperglycemia promotes non-enzymatic glycation of long-lived matrix proteins such as collagen, forming irreversible cross-links that stiffen the extracellular matrix, resist metalloproteinase degradation, and accumulate within pulley and tendon tissues, all of which plausibly increase pulley thickness and reduce tendon gliding efficiency, thereby aggravating triggering in the diabetic milieu [^111ohNHs] [^112qAbcb] [^114Zuefj].

> Wait, let me verify the structural correlate in vivo, because ultrasound often shows A1 pulley thickening and increased flexor tendon cross-sectional area in symptomatic trigger digits; I initially assumed that all metabolic comorbid states would similarly increase A1 pulley thickness, but hold on, a comparative ultrasonographic study actually found greater A1 pulley thickness in primary trigger finger than in the hyperuricemia-associated subgroup, so I should be cautious extrapolating from one metabolic condition to another even though the common denominator is matrix remodeling in symptomatic TF [^111PX3mK] [^117S77ZB].

> Next, I will examine fibroproliferative signaling because diabetes creates a profibrotic microenvironment: hyperglycemia and insulin resistance tilt the MMP/TIMP balance toward net collagen deposition, and chronic low-grade inflammation (for example, TGF-β and IL-6 pathways) further activates myofibroblasts, which helps explain why diabetes clusters with fibroproliferative hand disorders such as Dupuytren disease and why upper-limb complications occur two to three times more frequently in diabetes, although I should confirm heterogeneity across studies and populations [^111ohNHs] [^112i34kc] [^114Zuefj] [^113YLREf].

> I need to check microvascular contributions next: diabetic microangiopathy and endothelial dysfunction can compromise perfusion of relatively avascular tendon and pulley regions, promoting local hypoxia, aberrant matrix turnover, and tenocyte apoptosis, which clinically tracks with slower symptom resolution and higher recurrence rates in people with diabetes compared with those without, though effect sizes vary across cohorts and disease duration [^112i34kc] [^111ohNHs] [^114Zuefj].

> I will now examine metabolic-hormonal dysregulation, because insulin/IGF-1 axis activity may be relevant: genetic and phenotypic data link elevated IGF-1 signaling to both trigger finger and carpal tunnel syndrome, with acromegaly serving as a clinical model where IGF-1 normalization can reverse A1 pulley tendon thickening, but wait, I should verify that this does not imply uniformly elevated IGF-1 in all diabetes phenotypes; rather, the point is that IGF-1 pathway activity can converge with hyperinsulinemia-driven tenocyte responses to favor hypertrophic and fibrotic changes in susceptible individuals [^111ohTiz] [^111ohNHs].

> Let me integrate this into a unified model: hyperglycemia-driven AGE cross-linking initiates matrix stiffening in pulley and tendon, fibroproliferative signaling and low-grade inflammation propagate collagen accumulation, microvascular compromise sustains hypoxic remodeling, and metabolic-hormonal inputs amplify these changes, producing a "double-hit" of sheath stenosis and tendon swelling that increases mechanical impedance and symptomatic locking, which is clinically consistent with more frequent, more severe, and often more persistent trigger finger in diabetes, though I should acknowledge the mechanistic data are largely observational and translational rather than from interventional trials [^111ohNHs] [^114Zuefj].

> I should confirm a dose-response relationship with glycemic control, and the epidemiology supports it: registry and cohort analyses show that higher HbA1c is independently associated with increased risk of developing trigger finger in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes, with effect estimates on the order of 10–30% increased odds per higher HbA1c category, and separate work in diabetic registries found HbA1c greater than 7% to be an independent risk factor for stenosing flexor tenosynovitis, reinforcing biological plausibility for glycemia as a driver rather than a mere bystander [^114scsBn] [^114i1vQn].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about treatment responsiveness without reconciling data: a randomized, double-blind trial showed that corticosteroid injections are less effective in diabetic patients than in nondiabetic patients, and multiple retrospective series report lower injection success and higher failure with poorer glycemic control, yet some large administrative datasets suggest similar short-term injection success across diabetes status, indicating heterogeneity by study design, population, digit, steroid type, and follow-up; overall, the weight of controlled evidence points to attenuated steroid responsiveness in diabetes, particularly with higher HbA1c or longer symptom duration, but I should double-check individual patient factors when counseling [^115GqP39] [^115U9nW7] [^116m91Jk] [^112expvW] [^1139rykV].

> Next, I should review surgical considerations: most injected digits do not progress to surgery at the population level, but when surgery is needed, diabetic patients have higher odds of postoperative complications and stiffness after open A1 pulley release, and preceding corticosteroid injections are associated with postoperative infection risk, while cost analyses suggest that in insulin-dependent diabetes, immediate in-clinic release can be the least costly strategy compared with serial injections, though I should verify that local expertise, anesthesia preferences, and infection mitigation strategies can shift this calculus in practice [^1145b1w3] [^115tNAFn] [^111d3vdn].

> But wait, what about clinical-pathological correlations that guide expectations at the point of care; thickened pulley and tendon on imaging map to matrix accumulation and stenosis, the non-degradable cross-linked matrix helps explain recurrent symptoms and structural refractoriness to anti-inflammatory therapy, fibroproliferative diathesis aligns with coexisting Dupuytren disease and carpal tunnel syndrome, and worse glycemic control corresponds to higher failure after injection, although individual variability and competing comorbidities like obesity also modulate risk trajectories [^117S77ZB] [^111PX3mK] [^113YLREf] [^116m91Jk] [^114Zuefj].

> Finally, I should consider practice implications and emphasize modifiable factors: optimizing glycemic control may reduce incident trigger finger risk and possibly improve response to therapy, early recognition and targeted intervention can mitigate chronic fibrosis, and shared decision-making should incorporate the likelihood of reduced steroid responsiveness, potential surgical complication risk in diabetes, and patient-specific priorities, while acknowledging that much of the pathophysiologic evidence comes from observational and translational studies and that further trials are needed to define prevention and treatment strategies in diabetic hand disease [^114scsBn] [^114Zuefj] [^115tNAFn].

Diabetes mellitus increases the risk of trigger finger by **promoting tendon thickening and pulley stenosis** through chronic hyperglycemia [^111ohNHs], AGEs [^114Zuefj], and low-grade inflammation [^112i34kc]. These changes cause **impaired tendon gliding** [^113P2u6W] and a higher likelihood of multiple digit involvement, bilateral disease, and recurrence after treatment [^114Zuefj]. Poor glycemic control and longer diabetes duration further increase risk [^114scsBn] and reduce response to corticosteroid injections [^116m91Jk], often necessitating earlier surgical intervention [^115GqP39].

## Pathophysiological mechanisms linking diabetes mellitus to trigger finger

### Advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) and collagen cross-linking

- **Chronic hyperglycemia** in diabetes leads to non-enzymatic glycation of collagen and other extracellular matrix proteins [^111ohNHs], forming AGEs [^112rCC1j].

- AGEs cause **abnormal collagen cross-linking** [^111ohNHs], increasing tendon stiffness and thickness, reducing elasticity, and impairing tendon gliding through the A1 pulley [^113P2u6W].

- AGE accumulation in tendons and pulleys contributes to **fibroproliferative changes**, increasing friction and mechanical stress during finger movement [^112i34kc].

---

### Chronic inflammation and fibroblast activation

- Diabetes is associated with **chronic low-grade inflammation**, characterized by elevated pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g. TNF-α, IL-6) [^111ohNHs].

- Chronic inflammation stimulates **fibroblast proliferation** and extracellular matrix deposition, leading to thickening of the flexor tendon sheath and A1 pulley [^112i34kc].

- Fibroblast activation and matrix accumulation result in **stenosis of the tendon sheath**, impairing tendon gliding and causing triggering [^113P2u6W].

---

### Microvascular ischemia and impaired tendon healing

- Diabetes-related **microvascular disease** reduces blood supply to tendons and surrounding tissues, impairing nutrient delivery and waste removal [^112i34kc].

- Microvascular ischemia **delays tendon healing** and repair, promoting chronic inflammation and fibrosis [^113YD1pJ].

- **Impaired healing** increases susceptibility to repetitive microtrauma, further exacerbating tendon thickening and stenosis [^111ohNHs].

---

### Insulin resistance and metabolic dysregulation

In the context of insulin resistance and metabolic dysregulation, **insulin resistance** — a hallmark of type 2 diabetes — alters lipid metabolism and leads to **increased oxidative stress** [^113ZCzTT]. This metabolic dysregulation promotes tendon degeneration, inflammation, and fibrosis, further impairing tendon function and increasing the risk of trigger finger [^113YD1pJ] [^112i34kc].

---

## Clinical implications of diabetes-associated trigger finger

### Increased prevalence and severity

Trigger finger is **significantly more prevalent** in individuals with diabetes, with reported rates of 10% to 20% [^114Zuefj] versus 2% to 3% in the general population [^113P2u6W]. Diabetic patients often have **more severe symptoms**, including multiple digit involvement, bilateral disease, and higher post-treatment recurrence rates [^114Zuefj] [^114YD1cU].

---

### Reduced efficacy of conservative treatments

Corticosteroid injections, a common conservative treatment for trigger finger, are **less effective** in diabetic patients — particularly those with poor glycemic control [^116m91Jk] [^115GqP39]. Elevated HbA1c levels (> 6.5%) are associated with significantly **higher failure rates** of corticosteroid injections, necessitating earlier surgical intervention [^116m91Jk].

---

### Increased risk of surgical complications

Diabetic patients undergoing surgical release of the A1 pulley have a **higher risk of postoperative complications** [^115tNAFn], including delayed wound healing, infection [^111d3vdn], and persistent stiffness. Therefore, careful perioperative management and glycemic control are essential to minimize surgical risks and optimize outcomes.

---

## Influence of glycemic control and diabetes duration

Regarding glycemic control and diabetes duration, **poor glycemic control** — indicated by elevated HbA1c levels — significantly increases the risk of developing trigger finger [^114scsBn] and reduces the effectiveness of conservative treatments [^116m91Jk]. A **longer duration of diabetes** is associated with increased accumulation of AGEs [^111ohNHs], chronic inflammation, and microvascular complications [^112i34kc], further exacerbating tendon pathology and increasing the likelihood of trigger finger development [^114Zuefj].

Diabetes mellitus **significantly influences the pathophysiology of trigger finger** through mechanisms such as AGEs accumulation [^111ohNHs], chronic inflammation, microvascular ischemia, and insulin resistance. These mechanisms lead to **tendon thickening**, **impaired gliding** [^113P2u6W], and **increased risk** of trigger finger, particularly in patients with poor glycemic control and longer diabetes duration [^114scsBn].

### Symptom duration and diabetic control influence success of steroid injection in trigger finger [^116m91Jk]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2022). Low credibility.

Trigger finger is one of the most common hand abnormalities, affecting 2 percent of the general population. Conservative treatment with corticosteroid injections at the A1 pulley is a cost-effective first-line treatment. However, additional patient factors influencing steroid injection efficacy have not been fully described. The authors hypothesize that patients with longer symptom chronicity before treatment and elevated blood glucose levels would have reduced success rates of steroid injection therapy.

- **Methods**: A retrospective chart review of 297 patients at a single institution was performed between 2013 and 2019. Patients were included if they presented with a diagnosis of trigger finger and were treated with an initial corticosteroid injection at the A1 pulley.

- **Results**: Steroid injection therapy alone was successful in 65 percent of patients. Patients received an average of 1.61 steroid injections. Those who failed treatment received an average of 1.85 injections compared to 1.49 for those with successful therapy (p = 0.001). The presence of ipsilateral hand disease significantly increased the failure rate of steroid injections (43.4 percent versus 30.8 percent; p = 0.032). Diabetic patients with hemoglobin A1c levels greater than 6.5 percent had a significantly higher rate of failing steroid injection therapy (71.9 percent versus 38.1 percent; p < 0.001). Patients presenting with more than 2.5 months of symptoms had a higher failure rate of corticosteroid therapy (40.4 percent).

### Upper-limb complications in diabetes: A narrative review [^114Zuefj]. Diabetes Care (2025). Low credibility.

Upper-limb complications (ULCs) in diabetes, which affect joints, tendons, muscles, connective tissue, nerves, and skin, are underrecognized but prevalent conditions in type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Advances in diabetes care have extended life expectancy, leading to an aging population with diabetes and increased susceptibility to long-term complications beyond traditional vascular issues. Despite some data on ULCs epidemiology, the understanding of their pathogenesis, prevention, and impact on quality of life remains limited, and treatments are often based on clinical experience rather than robust evidence.

ULCs, including frozen shoulder, trigger finger, carpal tunnel syndrome, ulnar nerve entrapment, Dupuytren disease with contracture, and limited joint mobility, occur two to three times more frequently in diabetes, with higher rates in individuals aged over 50 years and those with a longer duration of diabetes. Chronic hyperglycemia, glycation of collagen, and low-grade inflammation are hypothesized contributors. Modifiable risk factors include poor glycemic control, smoking, and obesity. Individuals with diabetes face slower symptom resolution, higher recurrence rates, and a greater likelihood of bilateral or multiple conditions.

Awareness among clinicians and patients is critical, with emphasis on routine screening and proactive management. Early diagnosis, patient education, and targeted interventions can mitigate long-term complications and improve quality of life. Future guidelines should integrate ULC monitoring into routine diabetes care and prioritize clinical trials to establish.

### Cheiroarthropathy and tendinopathy in diabetes [^111ohNHs]. Diabetic Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

Joint problems commonly occur in people with diabetes. Cheiroarthropathy affects the hands and results in painless limited finger joint extension, appearing to be associated with longer diabetes duration and the presence of microvascular complications. The prevalence of cheiroarthropathy seems to be falling, perhaps as a result of improvements in glycaemic management. Non-enzymatic glycation of collagen results in abnormally crosslinked protein resistant to degradation, with subsequent increased build-up of collagen in joints. The management of cheiroarthropathy is predominantly conservative, with occupational and hand therapy at the forefront.

Tendinopathy is more common in people with diabetes than those without and is associated with obesity and insulin resistance. As with cheiroarthropathy, the exact causative mechanism of tendinopathy in diabetes is not known but may be linked to inflammation, apoptosis, and increased vascularity of affected tendons, driven by hyperinsulinaemia. Local fat pads have also been suggested to play a role in the pathogenesis of tendinopathy.

### High HbA1c levels are associated with development of trigger finger in type 1 and type 2 diabetes: An observational register-based study from Sweden [^114scsBn]. Diabetes Care (2022). Low credibility.

Trigger finger (TF) is a hand disorder causing the fingers to painfully lock in flexion. Diabetes is a known risk factor; however, whether strict glycemic control effectively lowers the risk of TF is unknown. Our aim was to examine whether high HbA1c levels are associated with an increased risk of TF among individuals with diabetes.

The Swedish National Diabetes Register (NDR) was cross-linked with the health care register of the Region of Skåne in southern Sweden. In total, 9,682 individuals with type 1 diabetes (T1D) and 85,755 individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2D) aged ≥ 18 years were included from 2004 to 2019. Associations between HbA1c levels and TF were calculated using sex-stratified, multivariate logistic regression models with 95% confidence intervals, adjusting for age, duration of diabetes, BMI, and systolic blood pressure.

In total, 486 women and 271 men with T1D and 1,143 women and 1,009 men with T2D were diagnosed with TF. Increased levels of HbA1c were associated with TF among individuals with T1D (women: OR 1.26 [95% CI 1.1–1.4], P = 0.001, and men: OR 1.4 [95% CI 1.2–1.7], P < 0.001) and T2D (women: OR 1.14 [95% CI 1.2–1.2], P < 0.001, and men: OR 1.12 [95% CI 1.0–1.2], P = 0.003).

Hyperglycemia increases the risk of developing TF among individuals with T1D and T2D. Optimal treatment of diabetes seems to be important for the prevention of diabetic hand complications such as TF.

### Trigger digits: Diagnosis and treatment [^117S77ZB]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2001). Low credibility.

Stenosing tenosynovitis of the thumb and fingers is a very common problem observed by primary-care physicians, orthopaedic surgeons, and hand surgeons. Primary stenosing tenosynovitis is usually idiopathic, occurring more frequently in middle-aged women than in men, though it can also be seen in infancy. Secondary stenosing tenosynovitis of the digits can occur in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes mellitus, gout, and other connective tissue disorders.

The diagnosis of triggering digits is generally clear and can be made based on an adequate clinical examination. Classification according to the type of tenosynovitis and the time from onset of symptoms may be prognostically significant and can affect the treatment outcome. As many as 85% of triggering fingers and thumbs can be treated successfully with corticosteroid injections and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Surgical release is generally indicated when nonoperative treatment fails. Percutaneous A1 pulley release can now be performed safely as an office procedure.

Overall, most of the comorbidities investigated in this study did not result in decreased efficacy of corticosteroids. Thus, continued corticosteroid treatment may be appropriate in most patients. Despite this, the presence of obesity and concomitant or prior carpal tunnel syndrome may be important comorbidities to consider when deciding to pursue continued corticosteroid treatment or electing for surgical management.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for type 2 diabetes mellitus, especially in the context of continuous glucose monitoring, the ADA 2025 guidelines recommend assessing skin reactions, which can be due to irritation or allergies. Addressing these reactions is crucial to ensure the successful use of these devices.

### Role of breast cancer inhibitors on diabetes mellitus - an in silico approach [^116bhbHA]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2015). Low credibility.

Today, cancer and diabetes are two of the major global health risks. There are several reports delineating how diabetes mellitus triggers a variety of cancers. By the year 2007, in the United States alone, it was noted that about 8% of the total adult population were diabetic, and 2.5 million people were reported as having breast cancer. Therefore, it is important to probe the relationship between diabetes mellitus and breast cancer.

Epidemiological studies have reported that the insulin-like growth factor 1 evokes the growth of colon tumors, suggesting that tumor growth is associated with the levels of insulin. Given that diabetes mellitus provokes tumor cells, it would be ideal to design drugs that can act on both diseases. One such drug is Metformin, which is a known diabetic agent that acts by reducing increased levels of insulin in the blood. Metformin decreases hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia by increasing skeletal muscle glucose uptake. Increased levels of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) in serum/plasma are observed in prostate cancer and pre-menopausal breast cancer.

The association of diabetes and breast cancer is a long-debated topic. Among the cancers present today, breast cancer is considered to be one of the leading causes of death in women. It was noted that 16% of the patients who suffer from breast cancer were also diagnosed with diabetes. Diabetes brings about several modifications in the hormonal system, which could trigger the enhancement of breast cancer, such as growth factors like estrogen and other growth factors.

### Progress to date for diabetes care: Going mobile and putting information at your fingertips [^1124HNB3]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

Six months ago, we cited our plans to hold the first Diabetes Care Symposium at the 72nd Scientific Sessions of the American Diabetes Association (ADA) in Philadelphia. As planned, this event was a high-level symposium that featured articles submitted for publication in Diabetes Care. These articles represented landmark diabetes trials and innovative clinical and translational studies that challenged paradigms of diabetes treatment or presented evolving clinical management strategies.

At the time of the online submission for publication, authors were given the option to have their manuscripts considered for the symposium. Over 150 manuscripts were submitted for the competition. The editorial committee selected six articles for eventual presentation. The authors of the selected papers were then invited to give an oral presentation at the symposium held during the ADA's Scientific Sessions in June 2012.

The manuscripts chosen for presentation covered a broad scope of topics, ranging from improving outcomes in islet cell transplantation to modulation of ectopic lipids by specific diets in individuals with type 2 diabetes. Topics also included evaluation of results of bariatric surgery performed at lower BMI cut points. These articles now appear in a special symposium section in this July issue of Diabetes Care.

Due to the popularity of the initiative and the success of the symposium, this competition and symposium will be held yearly during the ADA's Scientific Sessions. Invitations for consideration for next year's symposium will be distributed accordingly.

### Utility of patient-reported outcomes in prognosis of corticosteroid injection treatment success for trigger finger and De Quervain's stenosing tenosynovitis [^116NPfvK]. Hand (2025). Low credibility.

Corticosteroid injections serve as a first-line treatment for trigger finger and De Quervain's tenosynovitis. However, limited research has assessed pre-injection patient-reported outcomes as a predictor for treatment success after receiving corticosteroid injections. We hypothesized that patients with less pre-treatment impairment would exhibit more significant post-treatment improvements compared to patients with more severe functional impairments.

- **Methods**: We conducted a retrospective review of prospectively collected Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) upper extremity (UE) scores. These were from patients who underwent corticosteroid injections for trigger finger or De Quervain's tenosynovitis between 2017 and 2023. Independent variables included patient baseline characteristics, comorbidities, and initial PROMIS UE scores. The primary outcome was treatment success between 30 days and 12 weeks, defined as achieving the minimal clinically important difference for PROMIS UE without requiring surgery.

- **Results**: A total of 240 trigger finger and 74 De Quervain's tenosynovitis patients (N = 314) were analyzed. Post-injection, 63 (20.1%) patients achieved treatment success, 86 (27.4%) required surgical release, and 165 (52.5%) neither improved significantly nor underwent surgery. Notably, each 1-point increase in baseline PROMIS UE corresponded with 10% lower odds of achieving treatment success (P < .001). Among non-operative patients, each 1-point increase in baseline PROMIS UE was linked to a 0.51-point decrease in the PROMIS UE score (P < .001), and the presence of diabetes was associated with a 2.74-point decrease in PROMIS UE.

### Predictors of digital amputation in diabetic patients with surgically treated finger infections [^114R25P9]. Hand (2024). Low credibility.

Diabetes is a well-established risk factor for infections. Due to impaired wound healing and defects in cell-mediated immunity, patients have an increased susceptibility to infection and often present with more severe infections than patients without diabetes. While less common than diabetic foot infections, hand infections can also have devastating consequences, causing long-term disability, ranging from chronic pain to stiffness and joint contractures to amputation. Compared with patients without diabetes, patients with diabetes who present with hand infections are more likely to require repeat debridement or amputation for adequate infectious control. In the most severe cases, diabetic patients with hand infections present with sepsis, requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission and extensive resuscitative efforts in addition to prompt surgical treatment.

In diabetic hand infections limited to cellulitis alone, medical treatment with antibiotics is often curative. However, in the presence of devascularized tissue, abscess, tenosynovitis, osteomyelitis, or other deep infection, surgical treatment is indicated. This may entail digit preserving drainage/debridement with or without soft tissue reconstruction or amputation of the affected digit. In some cases, either surgical strategy is feasible, and the surgeon and patient can engage in shared decision-making to decide which option is best. In other cases, amputation is necessary due to extensive tissue necrosis or infection, which is uncontrollable by other means.

### Increased rate of complications following trigger finger release in diabetic patients [^115tNAFn]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2020). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of diabetes on complications after open trigger finger release compared with a cohort matched for age, sex, race, and body mass index class.

- **Methods**: A retrospective chart review was performed of diabetic patients who underwent trigger finger release at an academic institution within the past 10 years. Exclusion criteria included rheumatoid arthritis, malignancy, human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, connective tissue disorders, or systemic steroid use. These patients were then matched by age, sex, race, and body mass index class to nondiabetic patients who underwent trigger finger release during the same period. One hundred thirty-seven patients met inclusion criteria and were matched with controls. Complications included superficial or deep infection, delayed wound healing, limited range of motion at 6 weeks, pain requiring medication at 6 weeks, and return to the operating room.

- **Results**: In adjusted analyses, diabetic patients had a significantly higher rate of all-cause complications following trigger finger release compared with matched nondiabetic controls, with an odds ratio of 2.1. Diabetic patients also had a significantly higher rate of limitation in postoperative range of motion compared to the controls, with an odds ratio of 2.4.

- **Conclusion**: This retrospective case-control study identified that diabetic patients undergoing trigger finger release are at increased risk of all-cause postoperative complications and, specifically, range of motion limitation when compared with their nondiabetic counterparts.

### Glycated albumin modulates the contact system with implications for the kallikrein-kinin and intrinsic coagulation systems [^112rCC1j]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2023). Low credibility.

Advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) have previously been shown to trigger contact activation in vitro, including human serum albumin-AGE (HSA-AGE) and hemoglobin-AGE, to selectively trigger FXII-dependent PKa generation in the absence of associated intrinsic coagulation activation. AGE-modification of proteins is a denaturation process that induces the loss of α-helical structures within a protein and increases the content of β-sheets and unordered structures, resulting in enhanced susceptibility of AGE-modified proteins to aggregate. This misfolding is relevant in the study of contact activation in diabetes mellitus (DM).

Persistent elevation of blood glucose levels in poorly controlled diabetic patients increases the rate of nonenzymatic glycation of proteins and results in the accumulation of AGEs in plasma and tissues. HSA-AGE is found within atherosclerotic plaques and has also been linked to diabetic end-organ damage, including retinopathy, neuropathy, nephropathy, and coronary artery disease. The mechanism underlying the reason misfolded protein aggregates selectively trigger FXII-dependent BK generation in the absence of intrinsic coagulation currently remains unsolved; however, higher basal levels of FXIIa, PKa, FXIa, FVIIIa, and FIXa activity have been reported in patients with DM.

In the present study, we investigated how HSA-AGE can generate FXII-dependent PKa but does not proceed to activate coagulation via the intrinsic coagulation pathway. We examined the relationship between plasma glycation levels and contact pathway activation in diabetic patients.

### Diabetic hand complications in prediabetes: A controlled observational study [^11449Uuf]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2025). Low credibility.

To evaluate diabetic hand complications and hand function in prediabetic individuals, this controlled, observational study was conducted at a tertiary care hospital between January and July 2019. The research aimed to explore factors influencing hand dysfunction and its early musculoskeletal effects in prediabetes.

One hundred prediabetic patients and fifty normoglycemic controls aged 18–65 years were included. Participants were selected using a convenience sampling method, with eligibility based on the American Diabetes Association's prediabetes criteria. Participants with conditions affecting hand function were excluded.

- **Design**: Controlled, observational study.

- **Participants**: One hundred prediabetic patients and fifty normoglycemic controls aged 18–65 years were included. Participants were selected using a convenience sampling method, with eligibility based on American Diabetes Association prediabetes criteria. Participants with conditions affecting hand function were excluded.

- **Interventions**: Not applicable.

- **Main outcome measure**: Hand function was assessed using the Duruöz Hand Index (DHI). Grip strength measurements were obtained bilaterally using a calibrated digital dynamometer. The presence of hand complications such as carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS), limited joint mobility (LJM), trigger finger (TF), sclerodactyly, and Dupuytren's contracture was evaluated using standardized clinical criteria.

- **Results**: Prediabetic individuals had significantly higher DHI scores, indicating impaired hand function compared to controls (p = 0.025). Hand complications, particularly LJM (p = 0.024), were more prevalent in the prediabetic group. Regression analyses revealed that CTS (p = 0.002), TF (p = 0.007), and lower non-dominant hand grip strength (p = 0.003) were each statistically associated with impaired hand function.

No significant relationship was found between DHI scores and HbA1c, fasting glucose, or 2-hour glucose levels.

### Steroid injections in the management of trigger fingers [^115U9nW7]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2006). Low credibility.

The most commonly used primary treatment for trigger fingers is corticosteroid injection in the flexor tendon sheath, followed by surgical release if unsuccessful. This study examines the surgical and nonsurgical treatment of patients with trigger fingers presenting to a large Canadian tertiary referral center. The treatment success and side-effect profile of steroid injection therapy and surgical release were examined in the context of comorbid illness, specifically diabetes mellitus.

- **Design**: Retrospective review of all patients with trigger finger who were seen by the senior authors between January 1999 and June 2004.

- **Results**: In the study period, 118 trigger digits were treated, including 92 nondiabetic, 21 type 2 diabetic, and five type 1 diabetic trigger fingers. Of the 89 digits that received at least one steroid injection, 46 (52%) resolved completely and 42 (47%) were improved. Nondiabetic digits were treated successfully in 40 out of 70 digits (57%) with steroid injection therapy. Diabetic patients had a success rate of 6 of 19 (32%) with steroid injections, which is significantly lower than nondiabetics (P = 0.04). All type 1 diabetics (n = 5) required surgical treatment. Surgical treatment was successful in 71 of 72 (99%) digits. No side effects of steroid injection were noted, and short-term postoperative side effects were noted in 26 of 72 surgical patients (36%). No statistically significant differences were found in surgical complication rates in diabetics vs. nondiabetics or type 1 diabetics vs. type 2 diabetics.

- **Conclusions**: Steroid injections in the management of trigger fingers are commonly used, yet their success varies significantly between diabetic and nondiabetic patients. Surgical treatment, however, shows high success rates across all patient groups.

### Shared genetic susceptibility between trigger finger and carpal tunnel syndrome: A genome-wide association study [^113P2u6W]. The Lancet Rheumatology (2022). Low credibility.

Trigger finger (also known as stenosing flexor tenosynovitis) and carpal tunnel syndrome are the two most common non-traumatic hand disorders, with a lifetime prevalence of 2–10% for trigger finger and 3–10% for carpal tunnel syndrome. Trigger finger is caused by impaired gliding of the flexor tendons through the first annular (A1) pulley and manifests as painful clicking of the digit during flexion and extension, with progressive stiffness, locking, and loss of function. Carpal tunnel syndrome is a compression neuropathy of the median nerve that manifests as paresthesia, pain, numbness, and weakness of the hand. Both conditions are associated with marked functional impairment and reduced quality of life. Carpal tunnel syndrome is associated with an estimated loss of 78,375 disease-adjusted life years annually in the United States, and a total disease burden of US$2.7 to $4.8 billion per year.

Observational studies have provided evidence to suggest that there is a link between carpal tunnel syndrome and trigger finger: a prospective study found that 43% of patients diagnosed with trigger finger had clinical signs or symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome, and another study of patients with either condition found that, on clinical examination, 61% of patients had both carpal tunnel syndrome and trigger finger. Additionally, 63% of patients with trigger finger in another study had neurophysiological evidence of carpal tunnel syndrome compared with only 8% of controls. Although some studies have argued that the risk of trigger finger is increased after carpal tunnel syndrome, the connection between these conditions requires further investigation for a clearer understanding.

### A prospective randomized trial comparing the effectiveness of one versus two (staged) corticosteroid injections for the treatment of stenosing tenosynovitis [^111CsSdS]. Hand (2014). Low credibility.

Stenosing tenosynovitis, or trigger finger, is a common clinical condition frequently treated with steroid injections. Varied success is reported at early time points following injection. We present a prospective, randomized IRB-approved study to confirm these findings with a long-term follow-up.

- **Methods**: Adult patients presenting with symptoms of stenosing tenosynovitis who agreed to participate were randomized into two groups. Group 1 received an initial injection of a triamcinolone and local anesthetic mixture. Group 2 received the same initial injection and an additional staged injection at six weeks. The patients were then followed beyond two years. If Group 1 patients were still symptomatic at six weeks, another injection was given. An additional injection or surgery was defined as treatment failure. DASH scores were obtained at baseline, three, six, and twelve months.

- **Results**: Ninety-seven patients (101 trigger digits) were enrolled in the prospective trial. Fifty-six digits were randomized to the one-injection group, versus 45 digits randomized to the two-injection group (intention-to-treat analysis). After accounting for crossover between the groups, 42 patients received one injection, versus 59 patients receiving two injections (actual analysis). Overall failure was the same between the two groups. However, a higher surgery rate was noted for patients having undergone two injections versus one injection [47% versus 27% (p < 0.013), intention-to-treat]. Diabetes was associated with a higher surgery rate at one year within the group of overall failures [56% versus 37% (p = 0.05)].

### Risk factors for diabetic foot complications in type 2 diabetes: A systematic review [^116HMPB4]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2021). Low credibility.

The characteristics of all 31 articles, which were published between 1995 and 2019, are shown in Table 1. Six studies were performed in China, five in the United States, three in Taiwan, and two each in the UK, Denmark, and Saudi Arabia. One study each was conducted in Australia, Austria, Finland, Ghana, Italy, New Zealand, Pakistan, the Republic of Nauru, and Singapore. Additionally, two multinational studies were included: one in Europe (UK, Switzerland, Germany, Poland, Croatia), East Asia (Hong Kong, Japan), the United States, and Cuba; the other recruited subjects from sites in the UK, the United States, and Canada.

The sample sizes ranged from the lower bound for inclusion (100 subjects) to more than 1.3 million subjects. While 17 studies included only subjects with T2DM, the proportion of subjects with T2DM in a mixed diabetic study population was at least 75% in eight studies. In six studies, the patient population was not further defined regarding the proportions of subjects with T1DM and T2DM.

In most publications, the gender distribution was rather even. However, one study used the US National Veterans Health Administration (VHA) database, where the proportion of female patients was as low as 2.6%. The mean duration of diabetes ranged from 3.7 years to more than 13 years in different patient populations; this value was not stated in nine of the 31 articles.

### Ultrasonographic features of trigger finger in patients with hyperuricemia [^111PX3mK]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2020). Low credibility.

The purpose of the study was to compare demographic differences and ultrasonographic features in primary trigger finger and trigger finger in association with hyperuricemia.

Between October 2008 and February 2010, a prospective review was conducted involving 54 patients with trigger finger and hyperuricemia, 76 patients with a trigger finger without hyperuricemia, and 80 control cases. The clinical results were analyzed through descriptive epidemiology and ultrasonographic measurement of the thickness of the A1 pulley, as well as the cross-sectional area of the flexor tendon and synovium.

The study found that the middle finger was primarily affected, followed by the index and ring fingers in both trigger finger groups. The thickness of the A1 pulley, the cross-sectional area of the flexor tendon, and the flexor tendon with synovium in the trigger finger without hyperuricemia group were significantly larger than those in the trigger finger with hyperuricemia and control groups. There was no significant difference between the trigger finger with hyperuricemia and control groups. The double-contour sign and tophus were only observed in the trigger finger with hyperuricemia group.

In conclusion, the thickness of the A1 pulley, cross-sectional area of the flexor tendon, and the flexor tendon with synovium were significantly larger in the trigger finger without hyperuricemia group. These differences were not evident in the trigger finger with hyperuricemia group.

### Long-term outcomes following a single corticosteroid injection for trigger finger [^1152VMzx]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery. American Volume (2014). Low credibility.

The outcomes of corticosteroid injection for trigger finger are well documented only with short-term follow-up. The purpose of this investigation was to determine the long-term effectiveness of a single injection and to examine predictors of success up to ten years after injection.

- **Methods**: This case series analyzed 366 first-time corticosteroid injections in flexor tendon sheaths from January 2000 to December 2007, with a minimum follow-up duration of five years. Two hundred and forty patients (66%) were female, 161 patients (44%) had multiple trigger fingers, and eighty-eight patients (24%) had diabetes at the time of injection. The primary outcome of treatment failure was defined as subsequent injection or surgical trigger finger release of the affected digit. Medical records were reviewed, and any patients without documented failure or a return office visit in 2012 to 2013 were contacted by telephone regarding symptom recurrence and the need for additional treatment. Kaplan-Meier analyses with log-rank test and Cox regression analysis assessed the effect of baseline patient and disease characteristics on injection success.

- **Results**: Forty-five percent of patients demonstrated long-term treatment success following a single injection. In the final regression model, the interaction of sex and the number of trigger fingers was the single predictor of treatment success. Exploring this association revealed a ten-year success rate of 56% for female patients presenting for the first time with a trigger finger compared with 35% in male patients.

### Standards of care in diabetes — 2025 [^111ERAkr]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for diabetes mellitus type 1, specifically concerning the management of diabetic foot, the ADA 2025 guidelines recommend providing general preventive foot self-care education to all patients with diabetes. This includes those with loss of protective sensation. Patients should be instructed on appropriate methods to examine their feet, whether through palpation or visual inspection using an unbreakable mirror, for daily surveillance of early foot problems.

### The effect of corticosteroid injections on postoperative infections in trigger finger release [^111d3vdn]. Hand (2023). Low credibility.

Corticosteroid injections have proven benefits in the treatment of symptomatic trigger finger; however, the immune system and tissue repair modulating properties of corticosteroids justify further consideration in surgical candidates. The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between corticosteroid injections and postoperative infection in trigger finger release.

- **Methods**: A single-center retrospective review was conducted of patients seen from 2010 to 2019 to identify those who underwent trigger finger release with subsequent antibiotic prescription for chart-documented wound infection. A demographic-matched cohort of 100 patients was identified for comparison. Preoperative corticosteroid injection history, including timing, frequency, and dose, was collected for all patients. Patient demographics, comorbidities, and the presence of postoperative infection were collected from patient medical records. Superficial infection was defined as those requiring antibiotics for resolution without return to the operating room; deep infection was defined as infections that required irrigation and debridement.

- **Results**: Of the 3234 patients who underwent trigger finger release, 58 (1.8%) were identified with postoperative infections, 6 (0.2%) of which were deep infections. A history of corticosteroid injection was significantly more common in patients with postoperative infection. Compared with an age-matched, gender-matched, and body mass index-matched cohort, patients with postoperative infection had a significantly increased rate of diabetes mellitus at 34.5% compared to 19% (P = 0.0).

### Fibroproliferative disorders and diabetes: Understanding the pathophysiologic relationship between Peyronie's disease, Dupuytren disease and diabetes [^11419HNH]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2021). Low credibility.

- **Treatment of Dupuytren disease and Peyronie's disease**: There is a lack of strong clinical evidence for nonoperative treatments for early-stage Dupuytren disease, such as physiotherapy, splinting, and local radiotherapy. For patients with established flexion deformities, surgery is considered when hand function is affected, and the digits are flexed ≥ 15°. A popular surgical technique for advanced Dupuytren disease, known as Dupuytren contracture, is the removal of the diseased tissue or cords through fasciectomy. A minimally invasive surgical technique, percutaneous needle fasciotomy, mechanically divides the cords to straighten the affected finger. In one study, assessment of 292 treated joints five years post-procedure showed a recurrence rate for Dupuytren disease, defined as ≥ 20° of worsening, in the metacarpophalangeal joint of 22% for percutaneous needle fasciotomy and 5.3% for limited fasciectomy. The high rate of recurrence after surgical procedures implies that surrounding tissue may be involved in the disease etiology. Excision of the skin over the nodule and perinodular fat, or dermofasciectomy, has a reduced rate of recurrence, supporting the hypothesis that surrounding tissue may be involved in the fibroproliferative process of Dupuytren disease.

Approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2010, injectable collagenase clostridium histolyticum (CCH) is a minimally invasive treatment for adults with Dupuytren contracture with a palpable cord. The administration guidelines allow for the treatment of up to two affected areas.

### The relationship between diabetes mellitus and exfoliation syndrome in a United States Veterans Affairs population: a case-control study [^114X4Jag]. Journal of Glaucoma (2010). Low credibility.

Earlier studies suggest that an inverse relationship exists between diabetes mellitus and exfoliation syndrome (ES). We evaluated the relationship between diabetes mellitus and ES while controlling for important covariates. In addition, we investigated whether glucose control, as measured by glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels, differed between the subset of diabetic patients with and without ES.

This retrospective case-control study included outpatients seen in Veterans Affairs Boston Healthcare System eye clinics. Exfoliation cases (n = 328) and controls (n = 328) were drawn from the same clinic and matched for age. For all participants, we ascertained diabetes status, sex, race, body mass index, and glaucoma status. Among patients with diabetes mellitus, we collected the five most recent HbA1c levels and type of diabetes control.

Diabetes mellitus was present in 96 (29.2%) cases and in 114 (34.8%) controls. In multivariate analysis, no statistically significant relationship between diabetes mellitus and ES (OR = 0.77; 95% CI, 0.55–1.07) was identified. When glaucoma status was added as a covariate, the results were essentially unchanged (OR = 0.81, 95% CI, 0.57–1.14). Adjusted mean HbA1c levels were similar in diabetic patients with (6.85%; 95% CI, 6.66–7.04) and without (7.05%; 95% CI, 6.87–7.22) ES (P = 0.14).

In this predominantly white male population, we did not observe a statistically significant relationship between diabetes mellitus and ES. In addition, HbA1c levels did not vary among diabetic patients based on exfoliation syndrome status.

### Quality of life is markedly impaired by rheumatological and skin manifestations in patients with type 1 diabetes: A questionnaire survey [^114YD1cU]. Diabetes Therapy (2019). Low credibility.

A clear or likely diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome was reported by 48% of respondents in our study. In the DCCT/EDIC follow-up, lifetime prevalence was 30%. In recent smaller studies, lifetime prevalence was 21–37%. In a study of patients with diabetes of more than 20 years duration, 25% had received surgery for carpal tunnel syndrome, and 47%, including some patients who underwent surgery, had hand paresthesia. In our cohort, only 7% of respondents had undergone surgery for carpal tunnel syndrome. The differences are likely due to our broader study population, but underdiagnoses could explain the difference between clear and likely diagnoses in our study.

We identified a lifetime trigger finger prevalence of 30%, which is similar to that reported in other studies of 20–42% of T1D patients.

In our study, patients with upper limb soft tissue lesions were older, more likely to be female, and more likely to have longer diabetes duration than patients without these manifestations, whereas glycemic control measured by the most recent HbA1c did not differ between those with and without upper limb soft tissue lesions. Our respondents as a whole were also generally older, more likely to be female, and more likely to have longer diabetes duration, which could have led to an overestimation of the true prevalence of these lesions. However, our respondents also had significantly better glycemic control than reported in other studies, which is associated with reduced risk for upper limb manifestations in most studies.

Several other studies have identified an association between soft tissue manifestations and diabetes.

### Trigger finger treatment: Identifying predictors of nonadherence and cost [^112expvW]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2020). Low credibility.

Evidence-based practices in medicine are linked with a higher quality of care and lower health care costs. For trigger finger, identifying patient factors associated with nonadherence to evidence-based practices will aid physicians in treatment decisions. The objectives were to (1) determine patient factors associated with treatment nonadherence, (2) examine the success rates of steroid injections, and (3) evaluate the economic consequences of nonadherence to treatment recommendations.

- **Methods**: The authors used data from the Clinformatics DataMart database from 2010 to 2017 to conduct a population-based analysis of patients with single-digit trigger finger. They calculated rates of steroid injection success and examined associations between injection success and patient factors using chi-square tests. Additionally, differences in the cost to the insurer, the cost to the patient, and the total cost were analyzed.

- **Results**: A total of 29,722 patients were included in this analysis. Injection success rates were similar for diabetic (72 percent) and nondiabetic patients (73 percent), as well as for women (73 percent) and men (73 percent). Nonetheless, diabetics (OR, 1.4; 95 percent CI, 1.4 to 1.5; p < 0.001) and women (OR, 1.2; 95 percent CI, 1.1 to 1.2; p < 0.001) were significantly more likely to receive nonadherent treatment. In total, $23 million (U.S. dollars) were spent on nonadherent trigger finger care.

- **Conclusions**: Diabetics and women have increased odds of having surgery without a prior steroid injection, despite similar success rates of steroid injections.

### Diabetic microvascular disease in non-classical beds: The hidden impact beyond the retina, the kidney, and the peripheral nerves [^112i34kc]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2023). Low credibility.

Pathological findings in the musculoskeletal system in diabetes

The pathogenic mechanism underlying the association between diabetes and musculoskeletal disorders remains elusive, but it is probably due to a combination of factors. Firstly, it is well established that hyperinsulinemia and hyperglycemia are significant factors associated with bone metabolism damage. We refer the reader to the section on diabetes-related microvascular damage in the bone tissue for details. Additionally, inadequate glycemic control and prolonged DM duration have been correlated with degenerative osteoarthritis in weight-bearing joints. Secondly, the accumulation of AGEs in the BM leads to the loss of cartilaginous integrity on joint surfaces and deleterious structural changes in collagen cross-linkages. These changes contribute to the development of osteoporotic and osteoarthritic conditions, as well as related issues like sarcopenia, tendinopathy, neuropathy, and joint stiffness. Thirdly, diabetes-related chronic, low-grade inflammation is a key player in the progression of joint damage, stiffness, and pain. Lastly, impaired collagen synthesis and increased proteoglycan catabolism can alter the extracellular matrix composition, potentially leading to damage in bones, cartilage, and the surrounding periarticular connective tissues, including tendons, ligaments, joint capsule, and the synovial membrane.

- **Clinical conditions associated with musculoskeletal microangiopathy in diabetes**: Common musculoskeletal disorders observed in patients with DM include fibroproliferative disorders of the soft tissue.

### Cost of immediate surgery versus non-operative treatment for trigger finger in diabetic patients [^117188MZ]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

As health care costs continue to rise, providers must increasingly identify and implement cost-effective practice measures without sacrificing quality of care. Corticosteroid injections are an established treatment for trigger finger; however, numerous clinical trials have documented the limited efficacy of these injections in the diabetic population. Furthermore, the most cost-effective treatment strategy for diabetic trigger finger has not been determined. The purpose of this study was to perform a decision analysis to identify the least costly strategy for effective treatment of diabetic trigger finger using existing evidence in the literature.

Four treatment strategies for diabetic trigger finger were identified:

- **One steroid injection followed by surgical release**
- **Two steroid injections followed by surgical release**
- **Immediate surgical release in the operating room**
- **Immediate surgical release in the clinic**:

A literature review was conducted to determine success rates of the different treatment strategies. Costing analysis was performed using our institutional reimbursement from Medicare. One-way sensitivity and threshold analysis was utilized to determine the least costly treatment strategy.

The least costly treatment strategy was immediate surgical release in the clinic. In patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, this strategy results in a 32% and a 39% cost reduction when compared with treatment with one or two corticosteroid injections, respectively.

### Corticosteroid injection in diabetic patients with trigger finger. A prospective, randomized, controlled double-blinded study [^115GqP39]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery. American Volume (2007). High credibility.

It is generally accepted that the initial treatment for trigger finger is the injection of corticosteroid into the flexor tendon sheath. In this study, the efficacy of corticosteroid injections for the treatment of trigger finger in patients with diabetes mellitus was evaluated in a prospective, randomized, controlled, double-blinded fashion, while the efficacy in nondiabetic patients was evaluated in a prospective, unblinded fashion.

- **Methods**: Thirty diabetic patients (thirty-five digits) and twenty-nine nondiabetic patients (twenty-nine digits) were enrolled. The nondiabetic patients were given corticosteroid injections in an unblinded manner. The cohort with diabetes was randomized into a corticosteroid group (twenty digits) or a placebo group (fifteen digits), and both of these groups were double-blinded. Additional injections, surgical intervention, and symptoms of trigger finger were recorded. Treatment success was defined as complete or nearly complete resolution of trigger finger symptoms such that surgical intervention was not required.

- **Results**: After one or two injections, twenty-five of the twenty-nine digits in the nondiabetic group had a successful outcome compared with twelve of the nineteen in the diabetic corticosteroid group (p = 0.03) and eight of the fifteen in the diabetic placebo group (p = 0.006). With the numbers studied, no significant difference was found between the diabetic groups. Surgery was performed in three of the twenty-nine digits in the nondiabetic group compared with seven of the nineteen in the diabetic corticosteroid group.

The individuals from that gene expression study were monitored for a mean duration of 14 months, during which clinical parameters (e.g. range of motion, grip strength) were scored in the preoperative, early postoperative (3 months), and final postoperative periods for the affected digit. Analysis of correlations (R value) between clinical outcomes and gene expression showed significant results for preoperative grip strength (n = 7; MMP-2, 0.86 [P = 0.014]; MMP-14, 0.93 [P = 0.003]; TIMP-1, −0.93 [P = 0.003]; ADAMTS-2, 0.79 [P = 0.036]; ADAMTS-3, 0.79 [P = 0.036]; ADAMTS-12, 0.89 [P = 0.007]; and ADAMTS-16, 0.86 [P = 0.014]) and total further flexion (n = 17; MMP-2, 0.68 [P = 0.002]; MMP-14, 0.58 [P = 0.014]; ADAMTS-2, 0.65 [P = 0.005]; ADAMTS-3, 0.50 [P = 0.039]; ADAMTS-12, 0.52 [P = 0.033]; and ADAMTS-16, 0.49 [P = 0.047]).

The importance of MMPs in the aetiology of Dupuytren disease was first described in a case series in which 3 out of 12 people with gastric cancer treated with a nonspecific MMP inhibitor developed a condition resembling Dupuytren disease. The investigators hypothesized that the pathogenesis of Dupuytren disease may involve a reduction in the MMP:TIMP ratio, leading to increased formation of collagen and connective tissue.

### The association of hemoglobin A1c with the prevalence of stenosing flexor tenosynovitis [^114i1vQn]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Diabetic patients are susceptible to stenosing flexor tenosynovitis (FTS) and may have a diminished response to treatment. The purpose of this study was to determine whether elevated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels are associated with the development of FTS.

- **Methods**: A review of our diabetic registry identified a cohort of patients with diabetes mellitus. We stratified this cohort into those with and without a diagnosis of FTS during 2008 based on International Classification of Diseases-9 coding (727.00–727.05J). We reviewed charts to confirm the diagnosis. For patients diagnosed with FTS, we used the HbA1c measurement made closest to the date of diagnosis for analysis. We assessed patients without FTS using an average of HbA1c measurements during the same time period and performed subgroup analysis based on specified HbA1c levels: group A (HbA1c level < 7.0%), group B (HbA1c 7.0%-7.9%), group C (HbA1c 8.0%-8.9%), and group D (HbA1c ≥ 9.0%). Statistical testing consisted of chi-square analysis, odds ratios, and multivariate regression analysis.

- **Results**: There were 259,927 patients in 2008 identified with diabetes mellitus, 3,952 of whom were diagnosed with FTS. The period prevalence of FTS in this diabetic population was 1.5%. Multivariate regression analysis revealed that HbA1c greater than 7% was an independent risk factor for FTS. The odds ratios and confidence intervals were as follows: group B, 1.31 (1.20–1.42); group C, 1.35 (1.21–1.51); group D, 1.23 (1.10–1.38).

- **Conclusions**: The prevalence of FTS in this diabetic population was considerably lower than expected, and this may represent a more accurate assessment than previous studies.

### Trigger finger: Prognostic indicators of recurrence following corticosteroid injection [^114fTC7V]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery. American Volume (2008). Low credibility.

Corticosteroid injections are commonly used in the treatment of flexor tenosynovitis in adults. This study aimed to identify prognostic indicators of symptom recurrence one year after corticosteroid injection for the treatment of trigger digits.

- **Methods**: One hundred and thirty consecutive patients with trigger digits treated with corticosteroid injection were prospectively enrolled. Exclusion criteria included prior treatment and inflammatory arthritis. Demographic data and information on existing comorbidities were collected via a questionnaire. Patients were contacted one year after treatment to determine symptom recurrence. Kaplan-Meier analysis and the Cox regression model were used to estimate recurrence rates and identify predictors.

- **Results**: One hundred and twenty-four trigger digits in 119 patients (average age, 62.3 years) were included. The most commonly involved digits were the thumb (35% of the digits), ring finger (31%), and long finger (23%). Seventy digits (56%) experienced a recurrence of symptoms at a median of 5.6 months (range, 0.5 to 13.1 months) after the injection. Twenty-two digits (18%) underwent surgical release at a median of 7.4 months after the injection. According to the Kaplan-Meier analysis, the estimated rate of freedom from symptom recurrence was 70% (95% confidence interval, 63% to 77%) at six months and 45% (95% confidence interval, 36% to 54%) at twelve months. The estimated rate of freedom from surgical release was 95% (95% confidence interval, 92% to 98%) at six months and 83% (95% confidence interval).

### Clinical variation in the treatment of trigger finger: An international survey of orthopaedic and plastic surgeons [^111UqLyF]. Journal of Plastic, Reconstructive & Aesthetic Surgery (2022). Low credibility.

Trigger finger is a common condition affecting the hand, with therapeutic variability surrounding its management, especially in mild cases. The aim of this study was to survey secondary care surgeons to describe the management of trigger fingers. The steering group developed a survey for hand surgeons. Following piloting, the survey was distributed to hand surgeons in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands. A total of 713 plastic and orthopaedic surgeons were invited to participate in the online survey, and 440 (62%) completed it. In both mild and moderate cases of trigger finger, steroid injection was the preferred treatment option. Open surgery was the treatment of choice for severe cases. However, there was variation in the delivery of care, including type and dosage of steroid, site of injection, interval between injections, maximum number of injections, type of incision, and treatment of patients with diabetes or rheumatoid arthritis. This highlights the need for a better evidence base for the treatment of trigger fingers.

### Risk factors associated with progression to surgical release after injection of trigger digits [^1145b1w3]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons. Global Research & Reviews (2021). Low credibility.

A total of 42,537 injected trigger digits were identified in 31,830 patients, approximately 62% of whom were female and 45% of whom were diabetic. Patients aged 65 to 69 years, followed by those aged 70 to 74 years, were the most commonly treated age groups. The right hand was affected more often than the left, with the middle and ring fingers being the most commonly affected digits. Additional digits were frequently involved.

In total, 6,849 digits (16.10%) underwent multiple injections of the same digit. Surgical release was not commonly performed, with an overall rate of 10.7% of digits progressing to surgery over time, with the small finger being least likely to require surgical release.

### Fibroproliferative disorders and diabetes: Understanding the pathophysiologic relationship between Peyronie's disease, Dupuytren disease and diabetes [^113YLREf]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2021). High credibility.

Dupuytren disease is a progressive fibrotic disorder affecting the fascia of the palm and fingers. The mean age at onset is 49 years for individuals with a family history, compared with 55 years for those without a family history of Dupuytren disease. Nodules and cords fixed to the skin and palmar fascia disable normal movement of the hand, resulting in Dupuytren contracture. A defect in wound repair is believed to initiate the fibrotic process of Dupuytren disease, which encompasses Dupuytren contracture. Several risk factors have been identified for Dupuytren disease, including diabetes, increasing age, being male, heavy alcohol consumption, and smoking.

In individuals with both diabetes and Dupuytren disease, the ring and middle fingers are typically affected. In contrast, in those with Dupuytren contracture but without diabetes, the ring and fifth ('pinkie') fingers are typically involved. A systematic review of 21 studies reported a relationship between Dupuytren disease and diabetes, with an overall odds ratio of 3.1 (95% confidence interval, 2.7–3.5). Furthermore, a strong association between both types of diabetes and Dupuytren disease was noted. Investigators have identified a significant relationship between Dupuytren disease diagnosis and increasing HbA1c levels in 3,418 individuals with comorbid Dupuytren disease and diabetes. A 2019 study reported a genome-wide genetic correlation between Dupuytren disease and type 2 diabetes; however, at a local genetic level, there was no co-relation noted.

### The impact of type 2 diabetes on the development of tendinopathy [^113YD1pJ]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2021). Low credibility.

Tendinopathy is a chronic and often painful condition affecting both professional athletes and sedentary individuals. It is a multi-etiological disorder caused by the interplay among overload, aging, smoking, obesity (OB), and type 2 diabetes (T2D). Several studies have identified a strong association between tendinopathy and T2D, with an increased risk of tendon pain, rupture, and worse outcomes after tendon repair in patients with T2D. Moreover, consequent immobilization due to tendon disorders has a strong impact on diabetes management by reducing physical activity and worsening quality of life.

Multiple investigations have been performed to analyze the causal role of the individual metabolic factors occurring in T2D on the development of tendinopathy. Chronic hyperglycemia, advanced glycation end-products, OB, and insulin resistance have been shown to contribute to the development of diabetic tendinopathy. This review aims to explore the relationship between tendinopathy and T2D to define the contribution of metabolic factors involved in the degenerative process and to discuss possible strategies for the clinical management of diabetic tendinopathy.

### Rotavirus and type 1 diabetes-is there a connection? A synthesis of the evidence [^116roYuT]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2020). Low credibility.

Although the etiology of type 1 diabetes (T1D) is not well understood, it is believed to comprise both genetic and environmental factors. Viruses are the most well-studied environmental trigger, and there is a small but growing body of research on the potential influence of rotavirus on T1D. Rotavirus infections were initially identified as possible triggers of T1D due to similarities between viral peptide sequences and T1D autoantigen peptide sequences. Furthermore, rotavirus infection has been shown to modify T1D risk in T1D-prone mice.

However, research into the associations of rotavirus infections with T1D development in humans has yielded mixed findings and suggested interactions with age and diet. As the global availability of rotavirus vaccines increases, recent studies have assessed whether rotavirus vaccination modifies T1D development, finding null or protective associations. Overall, evidence at the time of writing suggests a possible triggering relationship between some wild-type rotavirus infections and T1D, but the potential effect of rotavirus vaccination remains unclear.

### Shared genetic susceptibility between trigger finger and carpal tunnel syndrome: A genome-wide association study [^117D8tmo]. The Lancet Rheumatology (2022). Low credibility.

Results

Phenome-wide analyses were conducted across the whole UK Biobank cohort (n = 502,490), which recapitulated a highly significant association between trigger finger and carpal tunnel syndrome (p < 1 × 10⁻³⁰⁰ [odds ratio (OR) 11.97], 95% CI 11.1–13.0). To explore the phenotypic association between trigger finger and carpal tunnel syndrome, we quantified the overlap between trigger finger and carpal tunnel syndrome and explored the clinical characteristics of patients with trigger finger, carpal tunnel syndrome, and trigger finger–carpal tunnel syndrome overlap. We identified evidence for a significantly increased prevalence of type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes, as well as significantly increased HbA1c levels (a routinely used biomarker for glycemic control) in patients with trigger finger–carpal tunnel syndrome overlap compared with patients with carpal tunnel syndrome alone (p < 1 × 10⁻⁴) and patients with trigger finger alone (p < 0.01).

To investigate the genetic architecture of trigger finger, we conducted a GWAS in participants with European ancestry (n = 456,606) from the UK Biobank, incorporating 2,908 patients with trigger finger who passed sample quality control, and 436,579 controls using a mixed-model approach that accounted for unbalanced case-control ratios, population structure, and cryptic relatedness. There were insufficient numbers of patients with trigger finger in non-European ancestry groups to conduct a sufficiently powered analysis.

### Is obesity a risk factor for developing trigger finger? A case-control analysis of 198 804 patients [^112gPe75]. Hand (2025). Low credibility.

Trigger finger (TF) causes pain and functional impairment. Previous studies have associated TF with carpal tunnel syndrome, which has been linked to obesity. This study investigated the relationship between obesity and the prevalence of TF.

- **Methods**: A retrospective analysis was conducted using data from the TriNetX Research Network (2006–2024). Patients with risk factors for TF (rheumatoid arthritis, gout, amyloidosis, prior carpal tunnel release, spontaneous rupture of flexor tendons, hypothyroidism, Dupuytren disease, and diabetes mellitus) were excluded. Two cohorts were compared: (1) patients diagnosed with TF and (2) those without. The groups underwent propensity score matching based on demographic attributes using a 1:1 nearest neighbor approach. Each patient's mean body mass index (BMI) was calculated by averaging all BMI measurements. Obesity was defined as a mean BMI greater than or equal to 30 kg/m². Multiple linear regression and logistic regression, incorporating TF diagnosis, BMI, and matched covariates, were used to adjust for confounding factors and estimate risk and odds ratios.

- **Results**: Data from 198,804 patients (99,402 per group) were analyzed. The prevalence of TF was positively associated with increasing BMI. Multiple linear regression revealed that BMI accounted for a small portion of the variance in TF prevalence. Logistic regression demonstrated an adjusted risk ratio of 1.02 (95% CI = [1.01, 1.03]) and an odds ratio of 1.03 (95% CI = [1.01, 1.05]), indicating a 2% to 3% increased risk of TF in obese patients.

- **Conclusion**: Obesity was associated with an increased risk of developing trigger finger.

### Fibroproliferative disorders and diabetes: Understanding the pathophysiologic relationship between Peyronie's disease, Dupuytren disease and diabetes [^114RaVuy]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2021). Low credibility.

The study explores the pathophysiologic connections between fibroproliferative disorders and diabetes, focusing on Peyronie's disease and Dupuytren disease. These disorders are characterized by the abnormal proliferation of fibrous tissues, a common feature often seen in patients with diabetes. Understanding these relationships is vital for developing better treatment strategies.

- **Pathophysiologic connections**: There is evidence pointing to a shared pathophysiologic process in these conditions and diabetes. Elevated glucose levels, for example, may contribute to fibrous tissue proliferation in these disorders.
- **Potential treatment strategies**: Addressing these connections can inform new approaches to managing both the fibroproliferative disorders and diabetes simultaneously.

This paper emphasizes the need for further research to clarify these links and their implications for clinical practice.

### Shared genetic susceptibility between trigger finger and carpal tunnel syndrome: A genome-wide association study [^111ohTiz]. The Lancet Rheumatology (2022). Low credibility.

Consistent with the hypothesis that overactive IGF-1 signaling is important in trigger finger and carpal tunnel syndrome, we discovered that IGF-1 plasma concentrations were positively associated with both conditions. Furthermore, despite carpal tunnel syndrome generally being associated with decreased height, the protective allele at our putative causal locus was associated with decreased height, suggesting a distinct pathophysiological mechanism.

Several other lines of evidence support the role of IGF-1 signaling in trigger finger and carpal tunnel syndrome. The prevalence of carpal tunnel syndrome and trigger finger is increased in patients with acromegaly, for whom raised IGF-1 levels are characteristic. By normalizing levels of IGF-1, either through pituitary resection or somatostatin analogues, increased tendon thickness at the A1 pulley can be reversed and symptoms of trigger finger ameliorated. In healthy patients who do not have acromegaly, administering exogenous growth hormone stimulates a rise in IGF-1, and patients can subsequently develop carpal tunnel syndrome. Exogenous growth hormone is also known to increase the risk of type 2 diabetes, which, along with type 1 diabetes, we found to be significantly enriched in patients with both carpal tunnel syndrome and trigger finger. Somatostatin analogues work not only by reducing pituitary growth hormone secretion but also by stimulating IGFBP5 secretion, which, in turn, inhibits IGF-1 signaling. Of note, our phenotypic analysis highlighted a significant association between trigger finger and both rheum.

### Risk factors for diabetic foot complications in type 2 diabetes-a systematic review [^115QkjzF]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2021). Low credibility.

The methodological aspects and the corresponding limitations of the particular studies are summarized. There were large variations concerning the definition of T2DM, ranging from criteria defined by the American Diabetes Association or the World Health Organization (WHO) to identification of patients with diabetes from charts or records via search for relevant diagnostic codes. In some publications, diabetes was assessed via self-reported questionnaires.

- **Outcomes assessed**: There were four main different outcomes: any diabetic foot (any DF), foot ulceration (FU), lower extremity amputation (LEA), and Charcot arthropathy (CA). In some publications, foot gangrene (FG) was assessed in addition. The outcomes were defined differently, ranging from WHO definitions to individual classifications. The assessment of the outcome was, in most cases, performed via foot examination or via searches in medical records for relevant diagnostic procedure codes.

- **Common limitations**: The limitations of the included studies are discussed. Most common limitations included missing patient characteristic data and the fact that cross-sectional studies do not allow for the assessment of a causal relationship between risk factors and outcome. Furthermore, in many of the studies analyzing LEA as an endpoint, previous foot problems of patients have not been assessed, which did not allow a judgment on the novelty of foot conditions.

### Resolution and recurrence rates of idiopathic trigger finger after corticosteroid injection [^1131GwHp]. Hand (2013). Low credibility.

This study addresses factors associated with apparent resolution and recurrence of triggering using data from providers with various treatment strategies. A retrospective review identified 878 adult patients with 1,210 Quinnell grade 2 or 3 trigger fingers that had one or more corticosteroid injections by one of three surgeons between 2001 and 2011. Two surgeons injected dexamethasone, but one had patients return one month after injection and was quick to recommend surgery (strategy A), while the other had patients return two months after injection, offered another injection or surgery, and followed the patient's preference. One surgeon used triamcinolone, had patients return only if the injection did not work, and waited at least three months to offer surgery. Factors associated with apparent resolution and recurrence of triggering were analyzed using bivariable and multivariable statistical analysis.

Triamcinolone injection was associated with more frequent apparent resolution (83%), compared to dexamethasone injection (30%). Apparent resolution of triggering was also associated with a delayed surgery treatment strategy (strategies B and C) and the affected finger (long and ring fingers were less likely to resolve). Recurrence of triggering after documented or presumed resolution occurred in 188 fingers (33%) and was associated with triamcinolone injection, index, long, and ring fingers, and orally treated non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. Strategy A had the lowest initial apparent resolution rate, the highest proportion of patients undergoing surgery, and the lowest final resolution rates.

### Long-term effectiveness of corticosteroid injections for trigger finger and thumb [^115N7wTS]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2015). High credibility.

The purpose of this study was to analyze the long-term response to corticosteroid injection in the management of trigger digit.

- **Methods**: This was an observational study of a prospectively recruited series of patients with a first-time diagnosis of trigger finger. The efficacy of the injections, comorbidities, digit injected, and related complications were compared and statistically analyzed.

- **Results**: A total of 71 digits were included in the study. The median (interquartile range) duration of follow-up was 8 years (range, 7.0–8.3 years). At final follow-up, complete remission of symptoms was obtained in 69% of cases. There were 37 trigger thumbs (52%), with a success rate of 81% compared with 56% in the other digits. There were 11 patients with diabetes mellitus, and 16 fingers developed trigger finger after carpal tunnel syndrome surgery. No complications were found.

- **Conclusions**: Steroid injections were an effective first-line intervention for the treatment of trigger finger. At long-term follow-up, the success incidence may be as high as 69%. In this study, the efficacy of this treatment increases when treating the thumb compared with other digits.

### Migraine and type 2 diabetes; is there any association [^114Vcvnb]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2015). Low credibility.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) influences individuals of all ages, and its prevalence is increasing worldwide. This disease is correlated with an enhanced risk of several other chronic disorders and causes multiple complications, such as diabetic neuropathy, retinopathy, and cardiovascular disorders. Among the complications related to diabetes mellitus, the association between migraine and diabetes is controversial.

Migraine is a neurovascular disorder with complex pathophysiology and recurrent headache attacks. The duration of a migraine headache is typically 4 to 72 hours and is usually accompanied by nausea, vomiting, or sensitivity to sound, light, or motion. Migraine is associated with an extensive range of subtypes, multiple comorbidities, and a variable prognosis. It has been better investigated than other types of headaches. A World Health Organization (WHO) review of global data detected migraine to be one of the most common health diseases worldwide and the most prevalent reason for headache consultations in America, South-East Asia, Europe, and the Western Pacific.

The cause of migraine is unknown, but several studies have shown that genetic and environmental factors are significant pathophysiological causes of migraine. Since migraine is a complex disease and several factors are involved in it, numerous studies have been conducted to discover its predisposing factors. Hypoglycemia and fasting, commonly observed in diabetic patients, are among these factors. Therefore, we compared the prevalence of migraine in diabetic and non-diabetic people and evaluated the relationship between migraine and some factors.

### Steroid injection versus NSAID injection for trigger finger: a comparative study of early outcomes [^114RzDBK]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Stenosing tenosynovitis of the flexor tendon sheath of the digits of the hand results from a discrepancy between the diameter of the flexor tendon and its sheath at the A1 pulley. The treatment options for trigger digits include oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and local NSAID applications, splintage, steroid injection, and percutaneous and open release of the A1 pulley. Injectable NSAID is used intramuscularly and locally in other sites. The hypothesis is that an injectable NSAID is as effective as the traditionally used steroid injection in the treatment of trigger digit, based on Quinnell grading, and that the treatment works as well in patients with diabetes as in those without diabetes.

- **Methods**: In this prospective, randomized, double-blinded controlled study for trigger digits, we injected diclofenac sodium locally in one group (NSAID group) and triamcinolone acetonide in another (corticosteroid group). A total of 100 patients (50 patients in each group) were followed up and assessed 3 weeks and 3 months after the injection.

- **Results**: At the end of the follow-up, 35 patients (70%) in the corticosteroid group and 28 patients (53%) in the NSAID group had complete symptomatic resolution. There was no difference between the response of patients with and without diabetes. There was no significant difference found in Quinnell score between treatments at 3 months, although at 3 weeks, the patients who received steroid had significantly better Quinnell scores.

- **Conclusions**: We concluded that, although steroids gave quicker relief, NSAID injections provided effective treatment outcomes in the long term.

### Risk factors associated with progression to surgical release after injection of trigger digits [^113Y9Eq5]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons. Global Research & Reviews (2021). Low credibility.

Previous studies evaluating persistent trigger digit after injection have demonstrated a success rate of 40% to 90%. Our results regarding the rate of surgical trigger finger release after injection are consistent with these previously published studies, with slightly above 10% of the injected digits progressing to surgical release. The small finger injection was associated with a lower rate of future surgery, in line with other studies reporting ring, index, and middle fingers as independent predictors for trigger recurrence.

This is the largest study at the time of writing evaluating risk factors and protective factors associated with progression to trigger finger release surgery after injection. A major finding of our study, in contrast to other published studies, is that neither complicated nor uncomplicated diabetes is significantly associated with requiring repeat injection or surgical release. Diabetes, particularly insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), is frequently discussed as a risk factor for both increased rate of trigger finger and decreased rates of successful treatment with corticosteroid injection. In a landmark prospective study, IDDM was associated with a lack of response to injection alone in 124 trigger digits in 119 patients. As the authors note in their article, the study was limited by a small number of patients with IDDM and a low number of the studied outcome, both of which increased the chance of a false-positive error. Another small, well-designed prospective investigation found that the 30 patients with diabetes enrolled in their study were.
