## Question

Fibroid behind the uterus

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about a fibroid described as "behind the uterus" and wants to understand its anatomical meaning, classification (such as with FIGO), appropriate diagnostic workup and imaging, symptom patterns related to its posterior location, implications for fertility, and how location affects risk. They are also interested in treatment options based on symptoms and reproductive plans — including medical, surgical, and interventional radiology approaches — as well as follow-up, surveillance, and practical counseling points, especially where evidence may be limited or evolving. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "behind the uterus" means anatomically and how to classify the fibroid using FIGO. Then, I should verify the initial diagnostic workup and imaging strategy. Next, I will assess symptom patterns that correlate with posterior location. After that, I need to consider fertility goals and how location modifies risk. Then, I will map treatment options by symptom profile and reproductive plans, including medical, surgical, and interventional radiology choices. Finally, I should confirm follow-up and surveillance plans and synthesize a practical decision framework with counseling points and uncertainties, ensuring I double-check areas where evidence is limited or evolving.

> Let me first confirm the anatomical interpretation: "behind the uterus" most plausibly corresponds to a posterior fibroid, typically subserosal or intramural with posterior projection, which can abut the rectum and sacral plexus and may be FIGO type 5–7 depending on serosal involvement and pedunculation. I should verify this mapping against FIGO nomenclature to ensure accurate communication and downstream planning [^111zhEJ2] [^116PFowD].

> Wait, let me verify the diagnostic approach before jumping to treatment. The initial imaging of choice is transvaginal and transabdominal pelvic ultrasound with Doppler to define size, number, location, and vascularity; MRI with and without contrast is reserved for complex cases, surgical planning, or when adenomyosis or sarcoma is a concern, and I should confirm that structured reporting using FIGO is requested to standardize descriptors and guide therapy selection [^117PKinh] [^114SoWox] [^111zhEJ2].

> I will now examine how a posterior fibroid's location shapes symptoms. Posterior lesions can compress the rectum, causing constipation, tenesmus, and pelvic pressure, and may irritate sacral nerves contributing to low back pain; I need to check that these bulk-related symptoms scale with size and number, and I should remember that bleeding symptoms are driven more by submucosal or cavity-distorting intramural fibroids than by purely posterior subserosal disease [^116Eas8b] [^111VPovU].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about fertility impact solely from location. Submucosal (FIGO 0–2) and cavity-distorting intramural fibroids impair implantation and increase miscarriage risk. For posterior fibroids that are subserosal or non–cavity-distorting intramural, the fertility effect is less clear, so I should confirm cavity relationship on imaging and align counseling with ASRM/SOGC guidance that myomectomy is prioritized for cavity-distorting disease and is not routinely indicated for non–cavity-distorting fibroids solely to improve spontaneous conception [^111VPovU] [^117CKcDv] [^113vqJTc].

> Next, I should review treatment options for asymptomatic posterior fibroids. Expectant management is appropriate when there are no bothersome symptoms, especially in perimenopausal patients, since fibroids often regress after menopause. I need to ensure we document baseline size and symptoms and arrange periodic ultrasound surveillance rather than intervening unnecessarily [^111Aca6K] [^1133dkdo].

> For symptomatic patients desiring medical therapy, let me consider first-line options and their limits. Combined oral contraceptives or a 52-mg levonorgestrel IUD can reduce heavy menstrual bleeding; tranexamic acid during menses is another option, and NSAIDs help with pain, but I should confirm that these agents target bleeding rather than bulk, so they are less likely to relieve posterior pressure or constipation; GnRH antagonists with add-back can be used for up to 24 months for significant bleeding, with the caveat of hypoestrogenic effects and recurrence after cessation, so shared decision-making is essential [^1123UsGt] [^111xxUQ9] [^114U2Spr] [^116Qmaq4].

> If symptoms persist or bulk predominates, I should double-check procedural options and candidacy. Myomectomy preserves the uterus and is preferred for patients with fertility goals or significant bulk; laparoscopic or robotic approaches reduce postoperative pain and length of stay compared with open surgery, though recurrence can occur and technique selection depends on size, number, and surgeon expertise; I need to ensure we discuss recurrence risk and potential need for reintervention [^111Q1bUe] [^112Rrwku] [^116dP1Ri].

> Let me consider uterine artery embolization (UAE) carefully. UAE effectively reduces fibroid volume and bleeding in most patients and is endorsed as a uterine-sparing option, but I should confirm fertility counseling: while pregnancy after UAE is possible, data on reproductive outcomes are limited and some guidelines advise caution or detailed counseling for those desiring future fertility; I should also review reintervention rates and the need for procedural expertise and shared decision-making with interventional radiology [^117GFEmX] [^114ZfA1y] [^113DMLrF].

> I should review image-guided ablation options next. Radiofrequency ablation (RFA), including transcervical ultrasound-guided systems like Sonata, and MRI-guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) are minimally invasive alternatives. RFA can reduce blood loss and recovery time compared with myomectomy in selected patients, and MRgFUS offers noninvasive thermal ablation with durability tied to achieving a high non-perfused volume ratio, though reintervention is common and pregnancy data remain limited. I need to ensure patient selection accounts for fibroid size, location, and access for energy delivery [^112wnYeV] [^116Y9P2r] [^1116Pj4v].

> But wait, what if the fibroid is truly massive or refractory to less invasive options? Hysterectomy remains the definitive treatment and is reasonable for patients who have completed childbearing or have failed or declined other therapies; I should confirm that patients understand irreversibility and discuss potential long-term health impacts, even as modern minimally invasive hysterectomy approaches reduce morbidity compared with open surgery [^116dP1Ri].

> I need to ensure follow-up and surveillance are explicit. After any intervention, pelvic ultrasound at 3–6 months and annually thereafter is reasonable to assess fibroid burden and symptom response. MRI can be reserved for complex anatomy or when symptoms persist despite treatment. I should double-check that we also track patient-reported outcomes using validated tools like the UFS-QoL to capture bleeding, bulk, and quality-of-life changes that imaging alone may miss [^114zqnR1] [^116Eas8b].

> Let me synthesize a practical decision framework and verify alignment with guidelines. For a posterior fibroid, start with symptom assessment and FIGO classification on high-quality imaging. If asymptomatic, observe. If symptomatic, tailor therapy to dominant symptoms and reproductive goals: bleeding-predominant disease may respond to hormonal or antifibrinolytic therapy, bulk-predominant disease may require myomectomy or ablation/UAE, and fertility goals steer toward myomectomy for cavity-distorting disease. Throughout, use shared decision-making to weigh benefits, risks, recovery, and the possibility of reintervention, and coordinate care across gynecology, radiology, and anesthesia as needed [^116RmcqA] [^113DMLrF] [^114uAqqb].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought "behind the uterus" might imply a cervical or broad-ligament fibroid, but I should correct that assumption. Cervical or type 8 fibroids are a separate category and require different surgical approaches, so I need to confirm the precise location on imaging and avoid overgeneralizing from the vague descriptor to prevent mismatched counseling or planning [^111zhEJ2] [^116PFowD].

> Finally, I should double-check key counseling points and uncertainties. Patients should be informed that symptom-fibroid size correlation is imperfect, that multiple treatments may be reasonable, that reintervention is possible after uterine-sparing therapies, and that fertility data for some minimally invasive options remain limited. I need to ensure we document these discussions and provide decision aids to support truly informed, preference-sensitive care [^115xB8hV] [^117SawpK] [^113DMLrF].

A fibroid behind the uterus is a **posterior fibroid** — a benign leiomyoma on the back uterine wall that can cause bulk symptoms (constipation, urinary frequency, pelvic pressure/back pain) and, if submucosal or intramural, heavy menstrual bleeding or infertility [^116Eas8b] [^117NRG8V]. Diagnosis relies on **transvaginal ultrasound** for initial assessment, with **MRI** for detailed mapping and surgical planning [^117PKinh] [^114SoWox]. Management is individualized: expectant care for asymptomatic cases; medical therapy (tranexamic acid, NSAIDs, hormonal options) for bleeding control; and procedural options (myomectomy, uterine artery embolization, radiofrequency ablation, or high-intensity focused ultrasound) for persistent symptoms or fertility goals, with hysterectomy as a definitive option when childbearing is complete [^116RmcqA] [^111Q1bUe] [^117GFEmX] [^112wnYeV] [^111KMGww]. Prognosis is excellent, though recurrence is possible; fertility may improve after removal of cavity-distorting fibroids, and minimally invasive options offer faster recovery with uterine preservation [^114Wi5uX] [^112Rrwku] [^117CKcDv].

---

## Anatomical location and classification

Posterior fibroids are **classified by FIGO** as subserosal (type 5–7), intramural (type 4), or submucosal (type 0–2) based on their relationship to the endometrium and serosa; posterior location can compress the rectum and bladder, causing constipation and urinary symptoms [^111zhEJ2] [^116Eas8b].

---

## Clinical symptoms and complications

Posterior fibroids may cause:

- **Bulk symptoms**: constipation, urinary frequency/urgency, pelvic pressure, low back pain [^116Eas8b].
- **Abnormal uterine bleeding**: heavy/prolonged menses, anemia [^116Qmaq4].
- **Reproductive issues**: infertility or pregnancy complications if cavity-distorting [^111VPovU].

---

## Diagnostic methods

- **Transvaginal ultrasound**: first-line for initial assessment of size, location, and number [^117PKinh].
- **MRI**: superior for detailed mapping, differentiating fibroids from adenomyosis, and surgical planning [^114GyxDU].
- **FIGO classification**: standardizes description and guides management [^111zhEJ2].

---

## Treatment options

Treatment is **individualized** by symptoms, age, fertility goals, and fibroid size/location:

| **Treatment modality** | **Indications** | **Advantages** | **Limitations** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Expectant management | Asymptomatic or mild symptoms | No intervention | Monitoring required |
| Medical therapy (tranexamic acid, NSAIDs, hormonal) | Heavy menstrual bleeding | Non-invasive | Symptom control only |
| Myomectomy | Symptomatic, fertility desired | Uterine preservation | Surgical risks, recurrence |
| Uterine artery embolization (UAE) | Symptomatic, uterine preservation | Minimally invasive | Potential fertility impact |
| Radiofrequency ablation | Symptomatic, uterine preservation | Minimally invasive | Limited long-term data |
| High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) | Symptomatic, non-invasive | Non-invasive | Limited availability |
| Hysterectomy | Definitive treatment, no fertility | Permanent cure | Loss of fertility |

---

## Impact on fertility and pregnancy

Submucosal or cavity-distorting intramural fibroids can **impair implantation** and increase miscarriage risk; myomectomy improves fertility and pregnancy outcomes in these cases [^111VPovU] [^117CKcDv]. Pregnancy after UAE is possible but may carry higher risks; **counseling is essential** [^113DMLrF].

---

## Prognosis and recurrence

Prognosis is **excellent** with appropriate treatment; recurrence is 15–30% at 5 years, higher with uterine-sparing options, and minimally invasive approaches enable faster recovery with uterine preservation [^116dP1Ri] [^112Rrwku].

---

A posterior uterine fibroid is a **benign tumor** on the back uterine wall that can cause bulk and bleeding symptoms; management spans observation, medical therapy, and minimally invasive or surgical options, with treatment tailored to symptoms and fertility goals, and overall prognosis is excellent.

Uterine leiomyomas (fibroids) are the most common tumors in women of reproductive age and a cause of significant morbidity in this patient population. Depending on the fibroid location, they can be the cause of a variety of symptoms, such as abnormal uterine bleeding, constipation, urinary frequency, and pain. Historically, hysterectomy has been the primary treatment option, and uterine fibroids remain the leading cause for hysterectomy in the United States. However, women who do not wish to undergo hysterectomy now have a variety of less invasive options available, including uterine artery embolization. This article discusses uterine artery embolization as well as some of the other treatment strategies for symptomatic uterine fibroids. In many situations, there may be no single best treatment option but several viable alternatives. Each option is discussed with consideration of outcomes, complications, and, when possible, cost-effectiveness. The recommendations in this article are the result of evidence-based consensus of the ACR Appropriateness Criteria® Expert Panel on Interventional Radiology.

### Medical treatment of fibroids: FIGO best practice guidance [^114U2Spr]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Even though uterine fibroids are a widespread condition, the range of approved medical treatment options remains limited. In fact, only a few drugs are officially approved for the therapy of fibroids. In both the USA and the European Medicines Agency region, selected gonadotropin‐releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonists have been approved for this indication. GnRH analogs are primarily indicated for the preoperative management of uterine fibroids, largely because of their unfavorable long‐term adverse effect profile. The previously approved therapy with ulipristal acetate had to undergo extensive restrictions because of safety concerns. Nevertheless, there are additional medications that may be used in clinical practice. These include combined oral contraceptives, oral progestins, the levonorgestrel‐releasing intrauterine system (LNG‐IUS), and tranexamic acid. Although not specifically approved for the treatment of fibroids, these agents can reduce the intensity of bleeding in cases of heavy menstrual bleeding and thereby improve symptoms and lead to an improved quality of life for the patients.

### FIGO best practice guidance for diagnosis and treatment of fibroids [^114uAqqb]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Medium credibility.

When the FIGO Regional Congress 2022 took place in Cartagena, Colombia, several experts came together and decided to improve care for patients with fibroids.

Why?

Because the majority of women worldwide develop fibroids during their reproductive phase. Fibroids can impair bladder, bowel, and sexual function, cause infertility, and lead to complications such as early and late miscarriage, breach presentation, postpartum hemorrhage, and irregular menstrual bleeding with anemia, and may even transform into malignancy.

Fibroids mainly affect women during their reproductive years, though their effects can persist beyond this period, depending on their size and location. African women bear the highest burden, with an incidence of up to 80%, and they tend to develop larger and more numerous fibroids compared to other populations.

Therefore, it is essential to equip doctors, nurses, and midwives with up‐to‐date knowledge on the pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment of fibroids. In regions where the disease burden is high, many health professionals may lack access to the theoretical and practical resources needed to diagnose and manage fibroids effectively.

It was clear from the outset in Cartagena that a free and accessible online resource would benefit health professionals. Since then, members of the four different FIGO committees (Minimal Access Surgery, Menstrual Disorders and Related Health Impacts, Reproductive Medicine, Endocrinology and Infertility, and Childbirth and PPH), representing the five FIGO regions, have joined forces to begin developing this. This online resource is intended to serve as the first FIGO 'toolkit' for doctors, healthcare professionals such as nurses and midwives, as well as graduate and postgraduate students. The aim is to remain precise and detailed, yet highly practical.

### Comprehensive review of uterine fibroids: developmental origin, pathogenesis, and treatment [^111cngnc]. Endocrine Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Uterine fibroids are benign monoclonal neoplasms of the myometrium, representing the most common tumors in women worldwide. To date, no long-term or noninvasive treatment option exists for hormone-dependent uterine fibroids, due to the limited knowledge about the molecular mechanisms underlying the initiation and development of uterine fibroids. This paper comprehensively summarizes the recent research advances on uterine fibroids, focusing on risk factors, development origin, pathogenetic mechanisms, and treatment options. Additionally, we describe the current treatment interventions for uterine fibroids. Finally, future perspectives on uterine fibroids studies are summarized. Deeper mechanistic insights into tumor etiology and the complexity of uterine fibroids can contribute to the progress of newer targeted therapies.

Coronal (a) and sagittal (b) T2W 1.5-T pelvic MRI images of a 42-year-old female with persistent pelvic pain following cesarean section show focal thickening of the posterior uterine wall transitional zone (asterisk) with tiny myometrial cyst (solid arrow head), suggesting focal adenomyosis

Classification of adenomyosis

The use of complex imaging techniques has revealed various subtypes of adenomyosis, often associated with histopathologic variation in glandular and muscular components. Furthermore, initial studies have linked various imaging criteria to symptoms of adenomyosis. Therefore, the need for a more holistic approach to identify various disease characteristics incorporating symptomatology, morphology, and pathologic features is rising in order to improve the diagnostic accuracy and adequately guide treatment decisions. Important factors to be included in classification systems would be the site and location of pathology, configuration, and size/volume relative to the total myometrial thickness. Most recent ultrasound and MR classification and reporting systems have been developed by Van den Bosch et al. and Bazot respectively, but the clinical relevance remains to be tested.

Treatment

As with many aspects of adenomyosis, treatment remains controversial. Important factors to be considered and discussed with patients are age, symptom severity, desire for future conception, and associated comorbidities. Recent studies estimate a prevalence of adenomyosis among females younger than 40 years to be about 20–30%, while in the rest of the patients, diagnosis is usually established in the fourth or fifth decade. Furthermore, diffuse adenomyosis, depth of invasion, and coexisting fibroids and/or endometriosis are associated with increased frequency/severity of symptoms and reproductive complications. Currently, treatment is on a case by case basis, and hysterectomy remains the definitive treatment in patients who are willing and do not wish for future fertility. With the introduction of assisted reproductive techniques, delayed age of conception, and availability of minimally invasive treatment options, the shift from hysterectomy as the "go to" option seems inevitable.

### Addressing heterogenous outcomes in uterine fibroid research: a call to action [^116rxj4D]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). Medium credibility.

Uterine fibroid tumors are the most common benign pelvic tumors in women, with complications that include heavy menstrual bleeding, pelvic pain, reproductive complications, and bulk-related symptoms. Although the majority of uterine fibroid tumors are asymptomatic, those women who experience symptoms can experience substantial burdens on quality of life and daily functioning. Comparative effectiveness reviews of available medical, surgical, and radiologic treatments have found that a lack of high-quality data to inform treatment decisions is, in part, due to the use of heterogeneous outcomes and instruments in clinical studies. With multiple new interventions emerging, this call-to-action encourages the development and use of a core outcome set that will capture the most relevant, patient-important outcomes in late-phase and after-marketing therapeutic trials for uterine fibroid tumors. The core outcome set should be developed by a diverse, multistakeholder group comprised of key healthcare decision-makers. Development and uptake of a core outcome set ensures that a consistent, collaboratively vetted set of outcomes will be accessible across different studies and promotes transparency for innovators who seek to anticipate the evidence needs of patients, providers, payers, regulators, and other stakeholders.

### Development of a core minimum data set to advance real-world evidence generation for uterine fibroids treatment technologies [^114uZPjf]. BMJ Surgery, Interventions, & Health Technologies (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Uterine fibroids (also known as leiomyoma) are growths that develop in the uterus. These benign growths can vary in size, number, and symptomatology. According to the Department of Health and Human Services, between 20% and 80% of women develop fibroids by age 50. In addition to existing pharmaceutical treatments, there are several interventions that are used to treat fibroids or their symptoms, including hysterectomy, myomectomy, radiofrequency ablation, uterine artery embolization, endometrial ablation, and magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound. Treatment decisions consider many factors, including experienced symptoms, size and location of the fibroids, patient's age, patient preferences regarding uterine sparing procedures, and the provider's clinical expertise and experience. Treatment decisions also consider the risk of an occult uterine sarcoma in a woman undergoing surgical intervention for presumed fibroids.

Despite the large burden of disease, evidence on the relative safety and effectiveness of available uterine fibroid interventions remains sparse. Given the paucity of comparative studies, there is a clear need for the systematic collection of post-market real-world data for women undergoing treatments using medical devices, with careful consideration of which patient characteristics, procedural data, and health outcomes are most important to capture from a clinical perspective. Pre-market studies for uterine fibroid treatment technologies include a relatively small number of patients compared with the large number of women affected by fibroids. Systematic post-marketing collection of data provides an opportunity to understand device performance in the broader use population and to identify potentially rare but serious complications, such as undiagnosed leiomyosarcoma. Additionally, because many women affected by fibroids have an interest in maintaining their fertility, systematic methods for capturing reproductive outcomes data in future pregnancies may be possible with large numbers of subjects providing post-market data.

To enable this type of post-market surveillance, we identified the need to create a Coordinated Registry Network (CRN)that would be capable of generating real-world data to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of technologies used for uterine fibroids. Foreseeing the potential evolution of technologies used to treat uterine fibroids, stakeholders acknowledged the importance of creating a core minimum data set that would be applicable to multiple technologies for uterine fibroids, including new devices that enter the market in the future. As a first task within this CRN, we used the Delphi method to reach consensus on a core minimum data set for the study of current and future devices and surgical interventions for uterine fibroids.

### Postoperative symptom changes following uterine artery embolization for uterine fibroid based on FIGO classification [^1139MoTd]. CVIR Endovascular (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Uterine fibroids, also known as uterine myomas or leiomyomas, are benign tumors consisting mainly of smooth muscle cells. Although non-malignant, uterine fibroids can be debilitating for women, causing menstrual disorders, infertility, pregnancy complications, and bulk symptoms that negatively impact women's quality of life. A recent study conducted in the United States found that among 2,994 women suffering from uterine fibroid-related conditions, the healthcare burden amounted to 6,585 medical encounters and 625 hospital bed days in 2022. In Japan, a current history of uterine fibroid was an independent risk factor for incidental anemia found in women aged 35 years and older during annual health check-ups. Treatment modalities for symptomatic uterine fibroids include medication, surgery, and minimally invasive procedures including uterine artery embolization (UAE) to control abnormal menstruation, reduce lesion size, or cure the disease definitively. For women who prefer uterus-sparing treatments and are not seeking to preserve fertility, UAE is a viable treatment option that decreases both fibroid volume and symptom severity, and the feasibility of a same-day UAE protocol has been demonstrated to be safe and effective in the outpatient setting. Studies that utilize the COMPARE-UF registry have found improvements in health-related quality of life (HR-QoL) and symptom severity scores, which persisted for 2–3 years after UAE and were comparable to myomectomy. Multicenter randomized trials such as the Embolization versus Surgical Treatment for Fibroids (REST-trial) have reported comparable improvement in HR-QoL and in levels of satisfaction at 1 year, and the HR-QoL remained comparably stable 10 years after UAE or hysterectomy from the EMMY trial.

### Diagnosis and classification of uterine fibroids [^115BvmHq]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Uterine fibroids, also referred to as leiomyomas, are benign uterine tumors with a lifetime prevalence of approximately 75% depending on race, age, and a variety of genetic and environmental factors,(although the terms can be used interchangeably, uterine fibroids/fibroids will be used across this article for consistency). While many individuals remain asymptomatic, approximately 30% of those affected experience symptoms that impact their overall quality of life. Furthermore, when symptoms occur, they may not be related to the fibroids since abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB), infertility, recurrent pregnancy loss, pressure, pain, urinary frequency, or gastrointestinal dysfunction may be present with a variety of otherwise unrelated conditions. The epidemiology and pathogenesis of uterine fibroids have been discussed elsewhere in this special collection. In this article we explore their classification, symptomatology, and diagnosis. First, we discuss the origins of classification systems designed to aid basic and clinical research, as well as education and clinical care.

### Emerging treatment options for fibroids [^113cGrqi]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Leiomyomas (fibroids) are common, usually benign, monoclonal tumors that arise from the uterine myometrium. Clinical presentation is variable; some patients are asymptomatic, whereas others experience heavy menstrual bleeding, pain, bulk symptoms, and/or alterations in fertility. Previously, treatment options for fibroids were largely surgical. However, over the last decade, options have grown to include many medical and procedural options that allow for uterine and fertility preservation. Clinicians must become familiar with these options to adequately counsel patients desiring treatment of fibroids.

### Uterine fibroid embolization: a new way to treat fibroids… [^1132GBmj]. AAFP (2000). Low credibility.

Do fibroids cause problems. Many women with fibroids don't have symptoms. In other women, fibroids can cause heavy bleeding during the menstrual period. Periods may last much longer than usual. Fibroids may also cause pain or a feeling of pressure or heaviness in the lower pelvic area, the back or the legs. Some women have pain during sexual intercourse. Others have a constant feeling that they need to urinate. There may also be a feeling of pressure in the bowel. Some women have constipation or bloating. How does uterine fibroid embolization work. Fibroids have a large blood supply that makes them grow. Fibroids will shrink or go away completely if the blood supply is stopped. Embolization means to stop or block the blood flow. So, uterine fibroid embolization is a way to stop the blood flow that makes fibroids grow. The procedure works even if you have several fibroids.

Next, the doctor will pass a tiny tube called a catheter through an artery to your uterus. When the catheter is in place, the doctor will inject tiny particles into the catheter. These particles, made of plastic or gelatin sponge, are about the size of grains of sand. These particles move through the catheter into the arteries that send blood to the fibroid. The particles will stop the blood flow to the fibroid. Over time, the fibroid will shrink in size. How successful is uterine fibroid embolization. About 85 percent of women have a lot of or total relief of pain and other symptoms caused by fibroids. What are the advantages of uterine fibroid embolization. There are several advantages. Usually, you only have to stay in the hospital one night after the procedure. You can return to your normal activities about a week after the procedure. This is a much shorter time compared with the six to eight weeks after surgery. There's no significant blood loss.

There's no big surgical incision. You don't need general anesthesia. A few women get an infection after the procedure. Antibiotics can control the infection. About 1 percent of women have an injury to the uterus from the procedure. This could make a hysterectomy necessary. A few women have started menopause after uterine fibroid embolization. Studies about getting pregnant after having this procedure are not complete.

### New treatments for uterine fibroids [^116EB5LJ]. Techniques in Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2006). Low credibility.

Since the introduction of uterine artery embolization as a minimally invasive treatment option for uterine fibroids, there has been a great deal of effort made toward developing other options for these patients. These options approach the problem differently, either with direct targeting of individual fibroids, organ-wide targeting of multiple fibroids, and systemic therapy to address the problem of fibroids using a hormonal approach. This review will focus on the different techniques and different philosophies that have been applied to the treatment of fibroids during the past decade.

### SOGC clinical practice guidelines. uterine fibroid embolization (UFE). Number 150, October 2004 [^116bZvmE]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To help direct the organized and effective implementation of uterine fibroid embolization into clinical practice in Canada.

Options

This document is restricted to the management of uterine fibroid embolization as performed by the radiologists utilizing a transfemoral artery approach with arteriography followed by vessel embolization.

Outcomes

Uterine fibroid embolization has been evaluated in terms of patient satisfaction, risks of complications, risks in subsequent pregnancy and rate of hysterectomy within a few months of the procedure. As the procedure is relatively new, data on long-term outcomes are not available.

Evidence

Published opinions of experts, supplemented by evidence from clinical trials where appropriate.

Values

The quality of the evidence is rated using the criteria described by the Canadian Task Force on the Periodic Health Examination.

Benefits, Harms, and Costs

For women presenting with symptomatic uterine fibroids who are candidates for UFE, there is often a benefit to avoiding an abdominal surgery. The risks of theUFE procedure, possible complications, and short- and long-term prognosis must be measured on an individual basis against the well studied surgical alternatives. Patient preference is an important component of this evaluation. The non-material costs of on going symptoms from the fibroids are difficult to measure and use comparatively against the cost of hospitalization and treatment. In evaluating costs of UFE, the calculations should take into consideration the cost of managing occasional complications including subsequent hysterectomy. The cost of myomectomy or hysterectomy will vary largely depending on technique used and length of hospital stay.

Recommendations

1. Women considering treatment of fibroids should be counselled that while the early results of uterine artery embolization are encouraging, no long-term data exist. (II-2-B). 2.UFE should only be considered for women with symptomatic or problematic fibroids who might otherwise be advised to have surgical treatment. (III-A). 3. UFE as a treatment for fibroids inpatients wishing to preserve their fertility should be undertaken with full disclosure to the patient about the limitations of such a procedure and the lack of existing data regarding future fertility and pregnancy outcomes. (III-C). 4. UFE is contraindicated in women who have evidence of current genitourinary infection and/or malignancy. (II-2-B). 5. Women who choose UFE as an alternative to hysterectomy should be counselled regarding the risk of major complications of UFE where hysterectomy may be urgently required and potentially lifesaving. In view of this small but important risk, UFE is relatively contraindicated in women who are unwilling to have a hysterectomy under any circumstances. (III-C). 6. Genitourinary infection is the predominant cause of serious morbidity and mortality. Further research on the utility of prophylactic antibiotic therapy and the value of pretreatment screening for infection is needed. (II-2-B). 7. A gynaecologist who is familiar with UFE should evaluate all patients considered for UFE before the procedure is booked and a consensus on the suitability of the procedure achieved between the gynaecologist and radiologist. (III-C). 8. Only radiologists with specialized embolization experience and techniques should perform UFE. (III-C). 9. The particular responsibilities of both gynaecologist and radiologist should be established prior to treatment and be set out in a relevant hospital protocol. A particular physician must be responsible for the patient at all times. (III-C). 10. A Canadian national registry of numbers, indications, outcomes, complications, and successful pregnancies associated with UFE should be created and jointly administered and funded by the SOGC, CAR, and CIRA. (III-C).

### Development of a core minimum data set to advance real-world evidence generation for uterine fibroids treatment technologies [^115xB8hV]. BMJ Surgery, Interventions, & Health Technologies (2022). High credibility.

Because the correlation between fibroid anatomy and symptoms is poor, 'objective' measures of success such as residual fibroid volume are not particularly helpful for evaluating effectiveness and do not allow for comparisons between procedures which affect fibroid size and those which physically remove the fibroids or the uterus itself. In addition, the lack of standards for reporting fibroid imaging further limits the utility of anatomic measurements as a relevant outcome. The participants focused on patient-reported outcomes related to symptoms but recognized that there is also a lack of clinical consensus on how best to measure and report fibroid-related symptoms. If validated patient-reported instruments such as the Uterine Fibroid Symptom Health-Related Quality of Life (UFS-QoL)can be easily incorporated into clinical practice (perhaps through patient-facing electronic portals or applications), adding them to this core dataset would be important.

There are both general and specific limitations to our methodology. Although multiple stakeholders were represented, the final consensus obviously includes trade-offs and may not represent the priorities of individual stakeholders or those who did not participate. In addition, the desire to capture data that are currently routinely captured as part of clinical care means that other important outcomes are not included. In particular, because validated quality-of-life instruments are not regularly collected as part of routine practice, treatment effectiveness within the current data elements can only be estimated through identification of additional procedures after the index treatment. Nonetheless, our results are strengthened by the fact that all participants shared an equal influence on the outcomes and potential bias from group dynamics and face-to-face responses was avoided through the Delphi method.

In conclusion, the data elements identified through the consensus process meet several criteria. They represent items that are currently routinely captured as part of the clinical record, they include factors that influence patient and provider decisions about treatment options which may influence outcomes (eg, past treatments, pregnancy history, uterine anatomy), and include important outcomes related to safety. In addition, the final common data elements were developed with input from multiple stakeholders, including patients, clinicians, researchers, manufacturers, and the FDA. Ultimately, the establishment of a national infrastructure for collecting these data elements will enable the accrual of high-quality data on devices and technologies used for uterine fibroids in the context of a multipurpose CRN. Additionally, the WHT-CRN will address FDA strategic priorities by increasing the use of real-world evidence, engaging patient partners, and promoting collaborative communities.

### Development of a core minimum data set to advance real-world evidence generation for uterine fibroids treatment technologies [^112HTLmZ]. BMJ Surgery, Interventions, & Health Technologies (2022). High credibility.

Imaging data

There was consensus on including specific data elements from any imaging studies obtained prior to the procedure, including date, type of modality, and fibroid characteristics — location, size, number visualized, and number measured, as well as uterine dimensions if recorded. As with menstrual history, there was a recognition that there is considerable variability in how fibroid imaging is reported and recorded and that further work on developing standards was needed. There was also consensus that any radiologic suspicion of adenomyosis, endometriosis, or a potentially malignant uterine lesion should also be recorded.

Procedure data

The participants reached consensus on minimal data elements for all procedures, including whether the originally planned procedure was performed, procedure and discharge date, an identifier for the primary surgeon, occurrence of any intraoperative adverse events and an assessment about the relationship between the event and any devices used, other relevant intraoperative findings (eg, presence of adhesions), and other procedures performed (eg, oophorectomy). Relevant pathology findings, depending on the procedure, include uterine and ovarian pathology, uterine weight (for hysterectomy), number and cumulative weight of excised fibroids (for myomectomy), and use of morcellation (including device and containment status). For procedures that do not specifically remove tissues, such as uterine artery embolization, MRI-guided focused ultrasound, and radiofrequency ablation, stakeholders agreed to include details on the embolized arteries or the number of fibroids that were treated.

Post-procedure (short-term and long-term) data

At every follow-up interval, there was consensus on collecting data on post-procedure adverse events, whether cancer was diagnosed during follow-up, and treatment failure or recurrence of symptoms. Treatment failure and recurrence of symptoms was defined as the need for another fibroid procedure. If a cancer diagnosis was indicated, working group members agreed that it should be further specified if the cancer was leiomyosarcoma. There was also agreement that other measures of symptom recurrence, such as changes in a validated patient-reported outcome measure (PROM) or the need for new medical therapy, would be helpful. However, because of the lack of current standards for the use of PROMs in clinical practice, it was agreed that the chosen outcome measures were more reproducible and would capture the most important safety outcomes. As noted above, there was also recognition that pregnancy outcomes are important for many patients undergoing treatment for uterine fibroids, but that the data elements collected as part of the medical and gynecologic history would capture the most relevant outcomes at visits after the index procedure.

### Alternatives to hysterectomy: focus on global endometrial ablation, uterine fibroid embolization, and magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound [^116aYzAv]. Menopause (2011). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to inform the clinician of alternatives to hysterectomy through a critical evaluation of three treatment options: global endometrial ablation, uterine fibroid embolization, and magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound. Studies published in English-language, peer-reviewed journals were systematically searched using Cochrane and Medline. Keywords used included "alternatives to hysterectomy", "endometrial ablation", "uterine fibroid embolization", "uterine artery embolization", and "focused ultrasound". Articles meeting the inclusion criteria were reviewed and analyzed for themes and similarities. All three alternative methods of treatment reviewed are currently approved for use in the United States and abroad. In fact, five different global endometrial ablation devices are approved by the Food and Drug Administration for treatment of menorrhagia. Patient satisfaction scores after endometrial ablation are high (90%-95%), but amenorrhea rates are much lower (15%-60%). Data from randomized trials demonstrate that uterine fibroid embolization results in a shorter hospital stay and quicker return to work as compared with abdominal hysterectomy for leiomyomas, but after embolization, up to 20% of women need a second procedure. Ex-ablative therapy of leiomyomas with focused ultrasound is the newest of the three methods. It has a special set of patient selection criteria and is only available at less than 20 medical centers in the United States. Leiomyoma symptom relief after focused ultrasound therapy at 1 year post-procedure is high (85%-95%). There are many effective alternatives to hysterectomy in women with menorrhagia and/or symptomatic leiomyomas. However, because these procedures are performed by individuals from different subspecialists, primarily gynecologists and interventional radiologists, clinicians must consider using a multidisciplinary approach to find the best procedure for a given patient. There are no randomized trials comparing uterine fibroid embolization to vaginal hysterectomy, laparoscopic hysterectomy, or laparoscopic myomectomy.

1 INTRODUCTION

Uterine fibroids are the most common tumor in women of reproductive age, with increasing prevalence as women get older. It is estimated that by the time they are in their 50s, around 80% of women will have developed a fibroid. Fibroids may have significant symptoms such as heavy menstrual bleeding and a feeling of pressure, which can affect the patient's quality of life.

Recently, childbirth trends have shifted, and more women appear to delay starting their families until their third or fourth decade. These are the ages when fibroids are more common and symptomatic. Fibroids have a higher prevalence in African American women, signifying a marked disparity in health needs when compared with white women. This trend may have driven an increased demand for uterine‐saving fibroid treatments. This change in demographics, coupled with the increased availability of newer treatment options, warrants that patients should be advised on the best evidence‐based treatment.

The symptoms experienced by women with fibroids may vary depending on the position, size, and number of fibroids. Intramural fibroids are the most common form of fibroid but are frequently asymptomatic. Fibroids can become very large and are often associated with heavy menstrual bleeding. Some clinicians believe that the presence of fibroids may have a negative impact on fertility, although the data are contradictory.

There is still uncertainty as to which is the best treatment for a woman with symptomatic fibroids who wishes to preserve her uterus. To address this, existing and new treatments should be fully evaluated from all perspectives, including the relief of symptoms and the impact on the woman's quality of life, and the data should be subject to careful review. Surgery, either myomectomy or hysterectomy, has traditionally been the main approach for the management of symptomatic fibroids. Myomectomy, while preserving the uterus, can lead to myometrial trauma. Myomectomy can be undertaken laparoscopically, hysteroscopically, or by a laparotomy.

### Reintervention rates after myomectomy, endometrial ablation, and uterine artery embolization for patients with uterine fibroids [^111QPCV4]. Journal of Women's Health (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

U(uterine fibroids [UF]) are benign hormonally responsive tumors that form in the wall of the uterus and are common in women aged 30–50 years.UF are usually asymptomatic but can cause pelvic pain, reproductive problems, and heavy menstrual bleeding that may lead to anemia. For those with severe symptoms, treatment interventions include hysterectomy and other less invasive procedures. Hysterectomy involves removing the uterus, which typically requires hospitalization and can be associated with a lengthy recovery period, and eliminates the ability to carry a pregnancy.

Many women elect to undergo potentially less invasive procedures than hysterectomy, including myomectomy, endometrial ablation (EA), and uterine artery embolization (UAE), in order to conserve their uterus, avoid prolonged recovery times, or potentially retain fertility with myomectomy. These procedures are considered reasonable alternatives to hysterectomy, given their safety profile, patient satisfaction, and quality-of-life scores. Numerous factors affect which intervention a patient undergoes, including symptom profile, patient preferences regarding recovery period and fertility, insurance, fibroid characteristics (location, number, and size), presence or absence of coexisting pathology, and experience of the physician. Specific comorbidities such as menstrual disorders and pelvic pain may also influence the treatment decision.

Patients who undergo a more conservative approach than hysterectomy would prefer to avoid additional procedures, but there is limited recent evidence describing long-term reintervention rates with direct comparisons between myomectomy, EA, and UAE, especially in large samples with > 1-year of follow-up observation. Existing evidence primarily comes from clinical trials with only two comparison arms or surveys of patients with variable follow-up periods that often do not adjust for patient characteristics potentially relevant to the treatment decision.

Long-term comparative analysis of patients undergoing procedures for symptoms of UF is an identified research priority; the United States Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality concluded in 2011 that "currently available literature is insufficient to draw conclusions about the relative benefits, harms, or costs of the available choices, making it difficult for patients, providers, payers, and others to select appropriate treatments".

### Uterine fibroids: rapid evidence review [^111JQbkU]. American Family Physician (2025). Medium credibility.

Uterine fibroids are the most common benign tumor in women. Most fibroids are asymptomatic, but presenting symptoms include those associated with increased uterine size (eg, abdominal distension, urinary frequency or urgency, constipation), abnormal uterine bleeding, pelvic pain, and infertility. The initial evaluation of fibroids should include a full gynecologic history with abdominal, speculum, and bimanual pelvic examinations. Initial imaging of choice is the combination of transvaginal and transabdominal ultrasonography. Pelvic magnetic resonance imaging with contrast may further characterize the extent of disease and guide treatment. Treatment choices are determined by fibroid size and location with preferences for uterine and fertility preservation. Pharmacotherapy is used to control heavy or abnormal uterine bleeding and includes combined and progestin-only oral contraceptives; 52-mg levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine devices; nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs; tranexamic acid; and hormonal therapies, such as gonadotropin-releasing hormone antagonists and gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists. Surgical and interventional options reduce bulk symptoms, reduce bleeding, and may preserve or improve fertility. Surgical and interventional radiologic options include hysterectomy, myomectomy, uterine artery embolization, radiofrequency ablation, and high-intensity focused ultrasonography. Treating vitamin D deficiency may reduce fibroid tumor size or halt progression.

### Postoperative symptom changes following uterine artery embolization for uterine fibroid based on FIGO classification [^113C9WHV]. CVIR Endovascular (2025). Medium credibility.

In 2011, the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) introduced a fibroid classification system that categorizes fibroids based on the lesional involvement of submucosal, intramural, and serosal layers of the uterus. FIGO classification for uterine fibroid is critical for making management plans clinically and is conducted based on imaging-derived (i.e. transabdominal, transvaginal ultrasonography, or magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) datasets, including estimation of total uterine volume and number of fibroids. Among the different types of uterine fibroids, those with submucosal and intramural components extending into the uterine cavity are considered to affect fertility the most. Fibroids of FIGO types 0–2 may cause menorrhagia, dysmenorrhea, infertility, and pregnancy loss due to their protrusion into the endometrial cavity, and are treated with techniques such as hysteroscopic myomectomy and UAE to relieve symptoms. FIGO 3 fibroids have been associated with lower rates of live births, pregnancies, and implantation during fertility treatments, and a careful myomectomy without endometrium disruption is the preferred treatment approach in women who wish to preserve fertility. Fibroids of other types are related to menstrual and bulk symptoms, and volume reduction or resection via UAE and laparoscopic/open myomectomy may be considered as these fibroids are difficult to reach with hysteroscopy. Reports of UAE efficacy across different types of fibroid have been published. However, despite the utility of FIGO staging in selecting treatment, particularly UAE, there is limited evidence-based analysis of the role of FIGO classification in the real-world setting.

Thus, this study was aimed to study whether different fibroid locations influence clinical outcome following UAE and fibroids were grouped according to whether they affected the endometrium.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® management of uterine fibroids: 2023 Update [^113DMLrF]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Uterine fibroids are the most common benign tumor in women of reproductive age and can present with symptoms including bleeding, bulk related symptoms, and infertility. Several treatment options are available for the management of uterine fibroids, including medical management, minimally invasive therapies such as uterine artery embolization and MR-guided focused ultrasound ablation, and surgical interventions ranging from laparoscopic myomectomy to open hysterectomy. Given this wide range of therapeutic interventions, it is important to understand the data supporting these interventions and to be able to apply it in different clinical settings. This document provides a summary of recent trials supporting various therapies for uterine fibroids, including recent evidence for MR-guided focused ultrasound ablation and a detailed discussion of fertility outcomes in myomectomy and uterine fibroid embolization. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process support the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer reviewed journals. Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where peer reviewed literature is lacking or equivocal, experts may be the primary evidentiary source available to formulate a recommendation.

2.4.1 Gonadotropin‐releasing hormone agonists

Gonadotropin‐releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists are peptides similar in structure to GnRH with amino acid substitutions that enhance their affinity for binding to the receptor. This causes continuous stimulation, initially producing an increase in the release of gonadotropins (flare effect) that can last 1–2 weeks, after which gonadal sex steroids decrease until reaching medical castration levels.

GnRH agonists are effective for shrinking fibroid size (about 50% of their initial volume). Several randomized, placebo‐controlled studies showed that leuprolide acetate significantly reduces uterine and fibroid volume. This results in improvement of fibroid‐related symptoms. Unfortunately, this highly effective therapy is limited in duration because of its adverse effects. It is restricted to a 3‐ to 6‐month interval, and when treatment is stopped, the fibroids come back to their pretreatment size. Consequently, therapy with GnRH analogs is not suitable as a long‐term treatment — although it can offer significant benefits in the preoperative setting — unless given with "add‐back" hormones, which at low doses do not affect the success of the treatment with regard to symptoms but do minimize long‐term adverse effects.

In reference to the use of GNRH analogs before surgery, the preoperative use of GnRH agonists is associated with an increase in preoperative hemoglobin, and a reduction in both uterine and fibroid volume. These effects come at the expense of a greater likelihood (odds) of adverse events, in particular hot flushes, headache, dizziness, vaginitis, change in breast size, and sweating. A Cochrane systematic review published in 2017 showed these principal outcomes during and after the hysterectomy. Other benefits included: a significant reduction in blood loss and the need for blood transfusions, smaller odds of requiring vertical incision, lower likelihood (odds) of difficult surgery and improved postoperative hemoglobin levels. In women undergoing myomectomy, most trials found that GnRH agonists reduced intraoperative blood loss, there was no evidence that pretreatment influenced duration of surgery, odds of intraoperative blood transfusions, duration of hospital stay, and recurrence of fibroids or postoperative hemoglobin levels.

### Uterine fibroids: diagnosis and treatment [^1133dkdo]. American Family Physician (2017). Low credibility.

Uterine fibroids are common benign neoplasms, with a higher prevalence in older women and in those of African descent. Many are discovered incidentally on clinical examination or imaging in asymptomatic women. Fibroids can cause abnormal uterine bleeding, pelvic pressure, bowel dysfunction, urinary frequency and urgency, urinary retention, low back pain, constipation, and dyspareunia. Ultrasonography is the preferred initial imaging modality. Expectant management is recommended for asymptomatic patients because most fibroids decrease in size during menopause. Management should be tailored to the size and location of fibroids; the patient's age, symptoms, desire to maintain fertility, and access to treatment; and the experience of the physician. Medical therapy to reduce heavy menstrual bleeding includes hormonal contraceptives, tranexamic acid, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists or selective progesterone receptor modulators are an option for patients who need symptom relief preoperatively or who are approaching menopause. Surgical treatment includes hysterectomy, myomectomy, uterine artery embolization, and magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound surgery.

### Uterine fibroids: assessing unmet needs from bench to bedside [^113piJB6]. Journal of Women's Health (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Uterine fibroids, or leiomyomas, are benign neoplasms of smooth muscle tissue that arise from the myometrium. Approximately 30%–35% of women will be diagnosed with fibroids using ultrasound detection, but over 70% of women are estimated to develop them by age 50. Although fibroids are not cancerous, they deleteriously affect the quality of life for millions of women. Approximately 25% of US women with uterine fibroids will experience symptoms severe enough to require treatment. Fibroids can cause heavy and prolonged menstrual bleeding, pelvic and back pain, anemia, and bulk symptoms such as increased urination, constipation, and abdominal distention. Because symptoms overlap with other gynecologic disorders such as endometriosis and adenomyosis, the average time to diagnose fibroids can be significantly prolonged. Furthermore, once a patient is diagnosed, heterogeneity in the size, number, and location of the fibroids can make treatment difficult.

The spectrum of fibroid disease is substantial — with some patients developing 60 or more fibroids and with growths ranging in size from tiny seedlings to as large as a melon. Moreover, fibroid size is not directly correlated with urinary or bleeding symptoms, making it challenging to predict the impact and burden from patient to patient.

Several factors have been proposed to influence an individual's risk for developing fibroids, including age of menarche, obesity, high blood pressure, gravidity, family history of fibroids, and race. There are limited data across all populations of women of color; however, some studies have found that black women are twice as likely to develop fibroids than Hispanic women and up to four times more likely than white women. Black women also present with earlier age of onset, more and larger growths, and increased severity of symptoms. In 2010, direct costs associated with patient management of fibroids were estimated at $9.4 billion, with an additional $17 billion lost in work-hour costs. The epidemiology and unmet health care needs concerning fibroids warrant further investigation to better understand the factors that influence the prevalence and disparities associated with the disease and to ameliorate the financial burden on patients and the health care system.

### Uterine fibroids: assessing unmet needs from bench to bedside [^115hPvKE]. Journal of Women's Health (2021). Medium credibility.

Uterine fibroids (leiomyomas) are noncancerous growths that can have deleterious effects on the health and quality of life for millions of women. Attempts to better understand the factors that influence prevalence and disparities associated with fibroids have been made; however, significant knowledge gaps continue to persist, which hinder care for individuals living with fibroids. The Society for Women's Health Research convened an interdisciplinary Uterine Fibroids Working Group to review the current state of knowledge about uterine fibroids and recommend areas in which to prioritize efforts to address research gaps and improve diagnosis, treatment, and access to care for patients with this chronic disease. Throughout a 2-day roundtable meeting, participants discussed updates on key literature, research, clinical practice, and public health data on uterine fibroids. Overarching themes and recommendations were identified and determined by consensus agreement of the participants at the conclusion of the meeting. Systematic studies of the etiology and pathology of uterine fibroids are needed to address important knowledge gaps and unmet clinical needs regarding the multifaceted management of fibroids and their effects on overall health and quality of life. The Working Group recommends addressing key deficits within the spheres of research, clinical care, and federal policy. Immediate needs include increasing research investment, improving fibroid assessment using pelvic imaging, implementing longitudinal study designs, addressing factors that contribute to disease disparities (especially among women of color), developing fertility-friendly treatment options, expanding awareness and education beyond gynecologic specialists, and advancing personalized patient care through shared decision-making approaches.

### Large uterine fibroids causing a closed loop small bowel obstruction following uterine fibroid embolization [^114YRqAN]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2024). Medium credibility.

What we did and why?

The clinical presentation was most consistent with either SBO from compression by the fibroid uterus versus an ileus from inflammation caused by surrounding uterine tissue necrosis. By hospital day 2, the patient was amenable to surgical intervention. We discussed treatment options including ongoing non-surgical management, versus surgical management via myomectomy or hysterectomy. Hysterectomy was recommended over myomectomy given that myomectomy alone could still predispose the patient to future issues with mass effect or inflammation, and since the patient did not desire future fertility. The patient elected for a hysterectomy as definitive management of uterine leiomyoma.

On hospital day 2, the patient underwent an exploratory laparotomy, total abdominal hysterectomy, and bilateral salpingectomy. We proceeded with an open approach as the bulk and shape of the fibroid uterus limited pelvic domain, resulting in a limited xyphoid-to-umbilicus distance, and restricted any lateral uterine movement that would facilitate a laparoscopic hysterectomy.

Intraoperative findings were notable for a multifibroid uterus with primarily right-sided bulk nearly reaching the umbilicus, including a large pedunculated fibroid as well as adhesions to a mass in the right pelvic sidewall thought to be an old fibroid that had detached from the uterus over time. The general surgery team joined the gynecology team intraoperatively as multiple bowel adhesions and an appendiceal adhesion to the posterior uterus were also noted.

The patient underwent lysis of adhesions and appendectomy as the appendix was almost completely adhered to the posterior uterus. The small bowel was eviscerated and ran from the terminal ileum to the ligament of Treitz where an intra-loop adhesive band was found at the distal ileum causing a closed loop obstruction (figure 2). A portion of the jejunum appeared to be congested, although it had visible peristalsis that was thought to be from evisceration of the small bowel through the laparotomy which put tension on the mesentery. Congestion improved during the course of the surgery. The patient underwent completion of the total abdominal hysterectomy and excision of the right pelvic sidewall mass without complications (figure 3). Cystoscopy was performed at the end of the case and showed bilateral ureteral jets without injury to the bladder. The patient had an uncomplicated postoperative course and was discharged on postoperative day 5. Pathology confirmed that the pelvic sidewall mass and the uterine fibroids were consistent with infarcted leiomyomata, as expected post-UFE.

### Understanding different aspects of blood supply of uterine fibroids: an overview of ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging techniques [^1125sQbW]. Insights Into Imaging (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Uterine fibroids are benign smooth muscle cell tumors, also referred to as (leio)myomas. They are the most common gynecological tumors with a cumulative incidence of more than 70% at the age of 50. A woman can have one or multiple fibroids, which can be located throughout the uterus, either close to the endometrium (submucosal), within the uterine wall (intramural), or on the outside of the uterus and bulging into the abdominal cavity (subserosal). Symptoms are abnormal uterine bleeding, pelvic pain, bulk-related symptoms or infertility, leading to more than 200,000 hysterectomies per year in the United States due to fibroids. Besides surgical options, less invasive alternative treatments have become available. In both surgical and non-surgical treatments of uterine fibroids, blood flow plays an important role in screening for eligibility, intra-procedural monitoring, prognosis, and follow-up.

Already at the stage of initial diagnosis, assessment of blood flow may be crucial to discriminate fibroids from adenomyosis or sarcomas. Misdiagnosis of adenomyosis as a fibroid can result in failure to identify the cleavage plane and increased risk of complications when treated minimally invasively (e.g. myomectomy). In unexpected sarcomas, myomectomy may influence the prognosis due to intraoperative tumor spill. In addition, outcomes after minimally invasive treatments such as embolization and ablation are correlated with the blood flow of a fibroid. Also in disease prognosis, including severity of symptoms, fertility and quality-of-life, blood flow plays an important role, e.g. fibroids with increased blood flow have a higher growth rate compared to uterine fibroids with low blood flow. Accordingly, assessment of the different aspects of blood flow has gained a prominent place in the management of uterine fibroids over the last 20 years.

### Non-surgical management of myomas [^113EeLKM]. Journal of Minimally Invasive Gynecology (2018). Low credibility.

Uterine myomas are a common condition and the leading cause of hysterectomy. Clinically, myomas can be challenging because they range from asymptomatic to causing severe, debilitating symptoms and occur in many women before childbearing is complete. Thus, women often seek uterine-conserving and nonsurgical management of their myomas. In this review the available uterine-conserving treatment options from medical management through minimally invasive procedures are discussed. To the extent of research available, the sustainability of symptom improvement and the effects on future fertility are reviewed. Future research may lead to therapies that reduce the risks of major surgery, decrease side effects, and offer primary or secondary prevention options.

### Ultrasound-guided high-intensity focused ultrasound for symptomatic uterine fibroids: clinical outcome of two European centers [^117M5LXD]. European Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Uterine fibroids are the most common benign tumors in women of reproductive age. Although benign, they are associated with significant morbidity in 20–50% of women. Symptoms may include menorrhagia, metrorrhagia, pelvic pain and pressure, urinary urgency, and even infertility. Recent consensus conferences recommend that the treatment of uterine fibroids should be approached interdisciplinary, with thorough consultation on all possible treatment options. Therapeutic options for symptomatic uterine fibroids are classified into non-uterus-preserving and organ-preserving procedures. Non-uterus-preserving options include various forms of hysterectomy, while organ-preserving options include open, laparoscopic, and transcervical myomectomy, pharmacological therapies, radiofrequency ablation, and uterine arterial embolization (UAE). In recent years, high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) has shown promise as an effective and low-risk treatment option for symptomatic uterine fibroids. Currently, HIFU treatment is guided either by ultrasound (USgHIFU) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRgHIFU). USgHIFU devices use diagnostic ultrasound to locate the target region and monitor the treatment response in real time. Successful tissue ablation is indicated by grayscale changes and cavitation observed on real-time B-mode ultrasound images after each exposure. MRI-guided systems apply MRI to determine target regions for therapeutic ultrasound, and indirect MRI thermometry confirms target position and measures therapeutic response.

Ablation in uterine fibroids

Uterine fibroids represent the most prevalent benign solid tumors found in the female genital tract. They manifest in approximately 20–25% of women of reproductive age. Gynecologists and specialists in reproductive endocrinology and infertility commonly encounter these fibroids in patients who present with either singular or a combination of symptoms. These symptoms may include heavy menstrual bleeding, infertility, colicky dysmenorrhea, and recurrent pregnancy loss.

The localization of uterine fibroids appears to play a crucial role in determining the frequency and severity of symptomatology. Traditional treatments involve abdominal myomectomy or hysterectomy, as these approaches have long been considered the standard surgical route for addressing symptomatic submucosal fibroids.

Historically, hysterectomy was routinely recommended for patients whose reproductive desires had been fulfilled, while abdominal myomectomy was considered the only viable option for young patients desiring pregnancy.

However, contemporary advancements have led to increased image-guided procedures and a growing array of pharmaceutical agents, each with value for appropriately selected and advised patients. Today, there is a trend toward minimally invasive treatment for uterine myomas.

The most used is uterine artery embolization (UAE), with adverse events related to possible postembolization syndrome, infection, pain, and potential damage to fertility.

Image-guided thermal ablation techniques, such as MWA, RFA, and image-guided HIFU ablation, have been used recently. The primary purpose of the ablation treatment is to improve the quality of life and alleviate the clinical symptoms.

Identifying the optimal approach requires the clinician to comprehensively understand the patient's history, including her fertility desires.

Ultrasound-guided percutaneous MWA has emerged as a widely used method for treating symptomatic myomas and adenomyosis.

### Diagnosis and classification of uterine fibroids [^111zhEJ2]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Uterine fibroids, or leiomyomas, are benign uterine tumors with a lifetime prevalence of approximately 75%. While only a minority become symptomatic, their impact on quality of life remains profound owing to heavy menstrual bleeding, bulk symptoms, and reproductive dysfunction. Interestingly, fibroids are not reliably diagnosed on physical examination, nor can their impact be predicted through palpation. Consequently, the diagnosis and phenotypic categorization of uterine fibroids relies primarily on imaging to guide subsequent clinical management. Ultrasound should be the first‐line diagnostic modality, and magnetic resonance imaging should be reserved for complex cases and/or surgical planning. Adherence to standardized structured reporting across imaging modalities is critical to improve diagnostic accuracy, differentiate fibroids from conditions such as adenomyosis or malignancies, predict therapeutic responses, and plan surgical interventions. Imaging reports should follow the FIGO classification system for uterine fibroids, to enable a standardized description of their relationship to the endometrium, myometrium, and uterine serosa.

### The modern management of uterine fibroids-related abnormal uterine bleeding [^116Qmaq4]. Fertility and Sterility (2024). Medium credibility.

Uterine fibroids (UFs) are the most common female benign pelvic tumors, affecting > 60% of patients aged 30–44 years. Uterine fibroids are asymptomatic in a large percentage of cases and may be identified incidentally using a transvaginal ultrasound or a magnetic resonance imaging scan. However, in approximately 30% of cases, UFs affect the quality of life and women's health, with abnormal uterine bleeding and heavy menstrual bleeding being the most common complaints, along with iron deficiency (ID) and ID anemia. Medical treatments used for UFs-related abnormal uterine bleeding include symptomatic agents, such as nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs and tranexamic acid, and hormonal therapies, including combined oral contraceptives, gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists or antagonists, levonorgestrel intrauterine systems, selective progesterone receptor modulators, and aromatase inhibitors. Nevertheless, few drugs are approved specifically for UF treatment, and most of them manage the symptoms. Surgical options include fertility-sparing treatments, such as myomectomy, or nonconservative options, such as hysterectomy, especially in perimenopausal women who are not responding to any treatment. Radiologic interventions are also available: uterine artery embolization, high-intensity focused ultrasound or magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound, and radiofrequency ablation. Furthermore, the management of ID and ID anemia, as a consequence of acute and chronic bleeding, should be taken into account with the use of iron replacement therapy both during medical treatment and before and after a surgical procedure. In the case of symptomatic UFs, the location, size, multiple UFs, or coexistent adenomyosis should guide the choice with a shared decision-making process, considering long- and short-term treatment goals expected by the patient, including pregnancy desire or wish to preserve the uterus independently of reproductive goals.

### Uterine fibroid embolization: a viable alternative to hysterectomy [^1126jEUq]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2009). Low credibility.

Benign uterine fibroids, or leiomyomas, are the most common tumors found in gynecologic practice. Symptomatic fibroids present with menorrhagia, pelvic pain, leukorrhea, pressure and bloating, increased abdominal girth, and severe dysmenorrhea. Traditional treatment has relied on surgery because long-term medical therapies have demonstrated only minimal response. Uterine fibroid embolization (UFE) using particulate emboli to occlude the uterine arteries, thereby disrupting the blood supply to fibroids and leading to devascularization and infarction, has been reported to be effective in alleviating fibroid-related symptoms. UFE is a safe, effective, and durable nonsurgical alternative to hysterectomy.

### Use of uterine artery embolization for the treatment of uterine fibroids: a comparative review of major national guidelines [^114ZfA1y]. Journal of Minimally Invasive Gynecology (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

Fibroids cause significant morbidity, including anemia, pelvic pain, and infertility. It is imperative that healthcare providers are well-versed in the varying treatments available for fibroids. Specifically, uterine artery embolization (UAE) is a treatment that improves anemia, pelvic pain, and quality of life. The purpose of this article is to compare international guidelines on UAE to offer best practices to healthcare providers.

Data Sources

Guidelines from the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology, The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists and the Royal College of Radiologists, National College of French Gynecologists and Obstetricians, The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, the Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada, and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence were reviewed alongside peer-reviewed PubMed articles.

Method Of Study Selection

A comparative review of major international guidelines was conducted to encompass potential geographical, cultural, and societal variances with UAE.

Tabulation, Integration, and Results

Review of data revealed guidelines agree with many constituents surrounding treatment of fibroids with UAE. Guidelines diverge regarding offering UAE for small fibroids, intracavitary/submucosal fibroids, and pedunculated serosal fibroids with variations on suggested imaging. Most agree that an experienced care team, including a gynecologist and interventional radiologist, should be included. Preoperative antibiotics and intrauterine device removal may be recommended. UAE for patients who desire fertility remains an option after counseling within most guidelines.

Conclusions

UAE is a safe, efficacious, and cost-effective alternative to hysterectomy and myomectomy. Including UAE as a treatment option during the patient counseling process is critical. Guidelines vary based on data interpretation and are based on clinical research and expert opinion. Due to mixed data and lack of randomized controlled trials, organizations differ when offering UAE to patients who wish to preserve fertility. It is vital to note emerging studies supporting the safety of UAE for subsequent pregnancy.

### Medical treatment of fibroids: FIGO best practice guidance [^113jS3tH]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Even though uterine fibroids are a widespread condition, the range of approved medical treatment options remains limited. In fact, only a few drugs are officially approved for the therapy of fibroids. In both the USA and the European Medicines Agency region, selected gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonists have been approved for this indication. GnRH analogs are primarily indicated for the preoperative management of uterine fibroids, largely because of their unfavorable long-term adverse effect profile. The previously approved therapy with ulipristal acetate had to undergo extensive restrictions because of safety concerns. Nevertheless, there are additional medications that may be used in clinical practice. These include combined oral contraceptives, oral progestins, the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS), and tranexamic acid. Although not specifically approved for the treatment of fibroids, these agents can reduce the intensity of bleeding in cases of heavy menstrual bleeding and thereby improve symptoms and lead to an improved quality of life for the patients.

### What predicts durable symptom relief of uterine fibroids treated with MRI-guided focused ultrasound? A multicenter trial in 8 academic centers [^116Y9P2r]. European Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

To identify variables predictive of durable clinical success after MRI-guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) treatment of uterine fibroids.

Materials and Methods

In this prospective, multicenter trial, 99 women with symptomatic uterine fibroids were treated using MRgFUS. Pelvic MRI was obtained at baseline and treatment day. The Uterine Fibroid Symptom-Quality of Life questionnaire was used to calculate a symptom severity score (SSS) at baseline and 6, 12, 24, and 36 months following treatment. Clinical, imaging, and treatment variables were correlated with symptom reduction sustained through the 12- and 24-month time points using univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses. A novel parameter, the ratio of non-perfused volume to total fibroid load (NPV/TFL), was developed to determine association with durable outcomes.

Results

Post-treatment, mean symptom severity decreased at the 6-, 12-, 24-, and 36-month follow-ups (p < 0.001, all time points). In univariable analysis, three variables predicted treatment success (defined by ≥ 30-point improvement in SSS) sustained at both the 12-month and 24-month time points: increasing ratio of NPV/TFL (p = 0.002), decreasing total fibroid load (p = 0.04), and the absence of T2-weighted Funaki type 2 fibroids (p = 0.02). In multivariable analysis, the NPV/TFL was the sole predictor of durable clinical success (p = 0.01). Patients with ratios below 30% had less improvement in SSS and lacked durable clinical response compared with those between 30–79 (p = 0.03) and ≥ 80% (p = 0.01).

Conclusion

Increased non-perfused volume relative to total fibroid volume was significantly associated with durable reduction of symptoms of abnormal uterine bleeding and bulk bother.

Clinical Relevance Statement

Patient selection for sustained clinical benefit should emphasize those with likelihood of achieving high ablation ratios, as determined by imaging (e.g., device access, Funaki type) and by considering the total fibroid load, not just the primary symptomatic fibroid.

Trial Registration

Clinical trial ID: NCT01285960.

Key Points

- Patient selection/treatment approach associated with durable symptom relief in MRI-guided focused ultrasound ablation of uterine fibroids remains unclear.
- The ablation ratio, non-perfused volume/total fibroid volume, was positively associated with sustained symptom relief in both bleeding and bulk bother at 1- and 2-year follow-ups.
- Selecting patients with imaging features that favor a high ratio of ablation to total fibroid load (including non-targeted fibroids) is the main factor in predicting durability of symptom relief after uterine fibroid treatment.

Leiomyomas (uterine fibroids)

Leiomyomas are prevalent benign tumors comprising smooth muscle cells and fibroblasts while being rich in extracellular matrix. Their prevalence increases with age and has been reported to be 69% in white women and 83% in black women by the age of 50. Whereas the exact pathogenesis of a leiomyoma is unknown, it appears to be multifactorial with the involvement of genetics, gonadal steroid exposure, and environmental factors. Leiomyomas can manifest in various phenotypes that vary in size, number, and location. While most women have no symptoms related to their leiomyomas, others may present with a spectrum of symptoms. Consequently, decisions regarding expectant, medical, or procedural interventions depend on a combination of the desires of the individual and their leiomyoma phenotype. Collectively, these circumstances challenge investigators and clinicians to understand when and how a given leiomyoma phenotype is responsible for the experienced symptoms and what therapeutic options best fit the patient's goals, particularly those related to fertility.

The complex context created by this highly prevalent disorder led to the development of the FIGO classification system, which was designed primarily according to the location of the leiomyoma with respect to the endometrium and uterine serosa (Figure 3). Submucous leiomyomas include those in contact with the endometrium, as determined clinically by hysteroscopy or uterine imaging using ultrasound‐based techniques or MRI. While Types 0, 1, and 2 project into the endometrial cavity, Type 3 leiomyomas are those in contact with the endometrium without focal distortion of the endometrial cavity. Intramural leiomyomas are surrounded by myometrium and are deemed Type 4 leiomyomas. In contrast, those in contact with the uterine serosa (Types 5, 6, and 7) are categorized by the degree to which they project out of the uterus, with Type 7 being the pedunculated variety. Type 8 leiomyomas are those found in alternate locations, most commonly the cervix. Especially important for intrauterine surgery, such as hysteroscopic myomectomy, are the tumors that contact both the endometrium and the uterine serosa, which are categorized with two numbers reflecting, in order, the endometrial and serosal relationships (e.g. Types 2–5 or 3–6). It is critically important that clinicians do not attempt hysteroscopic myomectomy, as removal will result in peritoneal cavity entry, termination of the procedure, and the risk of damage to surrounding visceral and other structures including the bladder, bowel, ureters, and blood vessels.

### The utility of MRI for the surgical treatment of women with uterine fibroid tumors [^114GyxDU]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2012). Low credibility.

Determination of the reasonable treatment options and the appropriate clinical treatment of women with uterine fibroid tumors often depends on the ability of imaging modalities to accurately detect and localize fibroid tumors. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) gives the most complete evaluation (sizes, positions, number) of submucous, intramural, and subserosal myomas and is the most sensitive modality for the detection of small fibroid tumors. MRI allows the evaluation of fibroid tumor proximity to the bladder, rectum, and endometrial cavity, helps define what can be expected at surgery, and may help the gynecologist avoid missing fibroid tumors during surgery. MRI can also make the diagnosis of adenomyosis reliably and may be able to identify uterine sarcoma when present.

### Image-guided therapies for uterine fibroids [^112vSdFv]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Uterine fibroids (leiomyomas) and adenomyosis are among the most common benign gynecological conditions affecting women of reproductive age. These disorders are frequently associated with abnormal uterine bleeding, pelvic pain, pressure symptoms on adjacent pelvic organs, and potential infertility. The incidence of fibroids increases as women enter their third and fourth decades of life. In parallel, recent trends in delayed childbearing have further emphasized the need for fertility-preserving treatment options. Notably, fibroids have a higher prevalence in African-American women, highlighting a significant disparity in health needs compared to white women. Historically, hysterectomy and myomectomy were considered definitive treatments. However, these procedures carry inherent surgical risks, longer recovery periods, and, in the case of hysterectomy, a complete loss of reproductive potential. Consequently, there is increasing demand for uterus-sparing, minimally invasive alternatives that provide effective symptom control with lower morbidity and preservation of fertility. Among the evolving treatment options, three image-guided, minimally invasive therapies have gained particular attention: Uterine Artery Embolization (UAE), Radiofrequency Ablation (RFA), and High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU). Uterine Artery Embolization (UAE), also known as uterine fibroid embolization (UFE), is a well-established endovascular procedure in which embolic agents are introduced via catheterization of the uterine arteries, inducing ischemia and infarction of fibroids. Performed under conscious sedation or regional anesthesia, UAE has demonstrated significant reductions in fibroid volume and symptom relief in over 80% of appropriately selected patients. All image-guided techniques are especially beneficial for women who desire uterine preservation, have contraindications to surgery, or wish to avoid major operative interventions. In comparison with UAE, Radiofrequency Ablation (RFA) uses targeted thermal energy to induce coagulative necrosis within fibroid tissue. This approach can be delivered via laparoscopic, transcervical, or transvaginal routes, depending on the platform. The Sonata® System integrates intrauterine ultrasound guidance with energy delivery, enabling precise fibroid targeting with minimal myometrial damage. RFA is associated with shorter recovery and less intraoperative blood loss, though it is more suitable for smaller or fewer fibroids and may be less ideal for extensive disease. Together, these advancements reflect a paradigm shift in fibroid management-driven by demographic trends, racial disparities, patient preferences, and technological innovations-toward evidence-based, uterus-preserving therapies tailored to individual patient needs. This article discusses details of each technique including the procedure, benefits and complications and also the impact on particular situations such as pregnancy. Some key points common to each technique are also mentioned.

1 INTRODUCTION

There are different options for treating uterine fibroids. In many cases, medical treatment is the first‐line treatment to preserve fertility and avoid surgery, and is a perfectly satisfactory solution for the patient. Beyond this, medical treatment can be used presurgically to minimize intraoperative complications by reducing the volume of the fibroid(s) or increasing the level of hemoglobin before surgery is performed.

Other treatment options in symptomatic women include interventional radiology and surgical procedures, and these will be presented in other papers in this collection.

Before one can decide which preparation should be used, it is obligatory to decide whether a treatment is necessary at all. Most women with uterine fibroids are asymptomatic and therefore require no intervention. Approximately 30% of them will present with symptoms, which can include abnormal uterine bleeding, anemia, pelvic pain and pressure, back pain, urinary frequency, constipation, or infertility, and will require intervention. The treatment options depend on the personal treatment objectives of the patients in addition to expected treatment effectiveness. Each therapy has its own advantages and disadvantages and improves fibroid volume, pain, menstrual bleeding, and/or anemiain different ways (Table 1).

Clinical Needs

Diagnosis and prevention

Fibroids are easily detected by ultrasound or other imaging technologies (e.g. magnetic resonance imaging or computed axial tomography scan); however, imaging does not indicate driver mutations or symptom presentation, nor does it differentiate between fibroids and leiomyosarcoma. A standard classification system is available to describe uterine fibroids based on location — subserosal, intramural, submucosal, or intracavity — and more detailed scoring systems incorporate symptom severity and size and heterogeneity of the growths. Updating the classifications to include other measures, such as tissue stiffness, which correlate well with patient clinical profiles and responses to treatment, is urgently needed.

While prevention or treatment of early disease would be optimal approaches, this is not the current clinical practice. Small fibroids could be detected in asymptomatic patients, but ultrasounds are often only conducted after a patient's symptoms become severe enough to consult a medical provider. Furthermore, abnormal or heavy menstrual bleeding can be a common occurrence in patients for years before other symptoms present or a fibroid is detected. Growth data have been collected to study tumor pathology, but no method exists to predict symptomatic fibroid development that would allow for a primary prevention strategy. Although it is possible that at-risk populations could be proactively screened by ultrasound to detect and treat fibroids, targeting these groups might also result in unnecessary harm by overtreating asymptomatic patients. To achieve prevention or earlier treatment for patients with symptomatic fibroids, long-term studies are needed to provide a better understanding of the predictors and genetic markers that underlie the differences between asymptomatic and symptomatic patient populations.

4 DIAGNOSIS

The diagnosis of uterine fibroids may occur during the assessment for symptoms such as AUB, infertility, or bulk symptoms, or incidentally after imaging, including the uterus.

4.1 History and physical examination

As discussed above, uterine fibroids typically cause HMB, and such bleeding is generally cyclical and predictable among ovulatory individuals. The location, volume, and number of tumors are key elements in determining the relationship between the fibroids and the symptoms at hand, especially HMB, infertility, and recurrent pregnancy loss. As a result, a thorough menstrual history, including all the elements of FIGO's AUB System 1, is critical to the establishment of an individualized differential diagnosis.

Although possibly palpable, manual examination of the uterus may also be limited by the patient's body habitus or by the inability to perform vaginal examination. On occasion, speculum examination may reveal a fibroid in the cervical canal, or in the vagina if complete prolapse has occurred. Regardless, the diagnosis and phenotypic categorization of uterine fibroids rely primarily on imaging with ultrasound or MRI to guide subsequent clinical management.

Challenges in diagnosis mainly relate to the standardization and quality of imaging reports. A study evaluating 1500 imaging reports for fibroids across 19 Canadian centers found that only 23% of ultrasound reports met all quality criteria, as recommended by the MUSA guidelines, with considerable interinstitutional variation in report quality. Ultrasound reports frequently fall below internally endorsed quality standards, leading to potential misdiagnosis and suboptimal patient management. Adherence to standardized structured reporting is critical, regardless of imaging modality, as accurate fibroid characterization directly impacts treatment decisions and outcomes. Enhanced adherence to structured imaging guidelines is essential to improve diagnostic accuracy, differentiate fibroids from conditions such as adenomyosis or malignancies, predict therapeutic responses, and plan surgical interventions. Clinicians caring for patients with uterine fibroids are encouraged to develop skills in image interpretation and ultrasound performance.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for uterine fibroids, more specifically with respect to clinical presentation, AAGL 2012 guidelines recommend to recognize that:

- submucous fibroids contribute to infertility, and, although their removal improves pregnancy rates, the fertility rate remains lower than in females with normal uterus

- submucous fibroids increase the risk of recurrent early pregnancy loss

- submucous fibroids increase the incidence of abnormal uterine bleeding, most commonly heavy menstrual bleeding, but the mechanisms by which the bleeding increases are unclear

- the direct source of abnormal uterine bleeding in patients with submucous fibroids is usually the endometrium itself, a circumstance that allows for the selection of medical therapies aimed at the endometrium or for endometrial destruction, provided fertility is not an issue

- the incidence of sarcoma in submucous fibroids is extremely low in patients < 50 years old; make clinical decisions in such patients with the understanding that submucous lesions are very rarely malignant.

### An altered perception of normal: understanding causes for treatment delay in women with symptomatic uterine fibroids [^117QoJ8i]. Journal of Women's Health (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Uterine fibroids are benign tumors that are the leading cause of hysterectomy in the United States. Despite their high prevalence and associated morbidity, there are little qualitative data characterizing what drives women's treatment-seeking behavior for their fibroids.

Methods

Women with symptomatic or recently treated uterine fibroids completed in-depth interviews and demographic surveys. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and uploaded to NVivo version 10 for data management and thematic coding. Coders identified major themes and subthemes that emerged from the interviews.

Results

Sixty women (n = 60) completed the interviews. The kappa among coders was 0.94. The mean age of participants was 43.0 ± 6.8. 61.7% of participants self-identified as African American, 25.0% as Caucasian, 8.3% as Hispanic, and 5.0% as Asian. Many women reported obtaining a delayed diagnosis for their uterine fibroids despite experiencing severe symptoms. There were five subthemes that identified why women delayed seeking treatment, which included the perception that their symptoms were "normal", they had a low knowledge of fibroids, they did not perceive themselves to be at risk for fibroids, they engaged in avoidance-based coping strategies, and/or they dissociated themselves from their fibroids.

Conclusions

Many women with symptomatic fibroids live with this condition chronically without seeking care. It appears that for some, limited knowledge regarding fibroids and normal menstruation may lead to a distorted view of what is normal with regard to uterine bleeding, resulting in limited treatment seeking behavior. Others know their symptoms are abnormal but simply avoid the problem. There is a need for patient-centered and community-based education to improve women's knowledge of fibroids and symptoms and to promote treatment options.

### Uterine fibroid tumors: diagnosis and treatment [^111FDtJ8]. American Family Physician (2007). Low credibility.

The incidence of uterine fibroid tumors increases as women grow older, and they may occur in more than 30 percent of women 40 to 60 years of age. Risk factors include nulliparity, obesity, family history, black race, and hypertension. Many tumors are asymptomatic and may be diagnosed incidentally. Although a causal relationship has not been established, fibroid tumors are associated with menorrhagia, pelvic pain, pelvic or urinary obstructive symptoms, infertility, and pregnancy loss. Transvaginal ultrasonography, magnetic resonance imaging, sonohysterography, and hysteroscopy are available to evaluate the size and position of tumors. Ultrasonography should be used initially because it is the least invasive and most cost-effective investigation. Treatment options include hysterectomy, myomectomy, uterine artery embolization, myolysis, and medical therapy. Treatment must be individualized based on such considerations as the presence and severity of symptoms, the patient's desire for definitive treatment, the desire to preserve childbearing capacity, the importance of uterine preservation, infertility related to uterine cavity distortions, and previous pregnancy complications related to fibroid tumors.

Symptoms of heavy menstrual bleeding increased over the past three years, resulting in a Pictorial Blood Assessment Chart (PBAC) score of 650 points (PBAC scores > 150 indicate heavy menstrual bleeding). Heavy menstrual bleeding was accompanied by frequent loss of blood clots, dysmenorrhoea and abdominal discomfort.

In spite of continuous use of ethinylestradiol/levonorgestrel 50 mcg/125 mcg, the severity of her menstrual bleeding had not diminished. Transvaginal ultrasound detected three fibroids, including a FIGO type 2 fibroid of 36×37×40 mm in the posterior wall of the uterus (figure 1) and two FIGO type 5 fibroids of 11×19×21 mm and 27×33×30 mm, located in the anterior and posterior walls, respectively.

Figure 1
Transvaginal ultrasound showing the FIGO type 2 fibroid before treatment.

In this case, treatment options were limited since there was a strong desire for uterine preservation and minimally invasive treatment. As this patient mainly suffered from heavy menstrual blood loss, a hysteroscopic treatment of the FIGO type 2 fibroid was a possible first step in treatment. Assuming that this type 2 fibroid caused a greater increase in menstrual blood loss than those located more subserosal. Due to the size (36×37×40 mm) and location of the fibroid, single hysteroscopic myomectomy would probably not be sufficient to remove the fibroid totally. Complete removal of the fibroid would require multiple sessions.

After information about other treatment options was provided (shared decision-making), this patient chose treatment with the Sonata system for her FIGO type 2 fibroid.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® fibroids [^114SoWox]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Uterine fibroids (leiomyomas or myomas) are the most common neoplasm of the uterus. Though incompletely understood, fibroid etiology is multifactorial, a combination of genetic alterations and endocrine, autocrine, environmental, and other factors such as race, age, parity, and body mass index. Black women have greater than an 80% incidence of fibroids by age 50, whereas White women have an incidence approaching 70%. Fibroid symptoms are protean, and menorrhagia is most frequent. The societal economic burden of symptomatic fibroids is large, 5.9 to 34.3 billion dollars annually. There are a variety of treatment options for women with symptomatic fibroids ranging from medical therapy to hysterectomy. Myomectomy and uterine fibroid embolization are the most common uterine sparing therapies. Pelvic ultrasound (transabdominal and transvaginal) with Doppler and MRI with and without intravenous contrast are the best imaging modalities for the initial diagnosis of fibroids, the initial treatment of known fibroids, and for surveillance or posttreatment imaging. The ACR Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process support the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer-reviewed journals. Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances in which peer-reviewed literature is lacking or equivocal, experts may be the primary evidentiary source available to formulate a recommendation.

### The impact and management of fibroids for fertility: an evidence-based approach [^114Wi5uX]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Fibroids affect 35% to 77% of reproductive-age women. When selecting a treatment plan for symptomatic fibroids, the fibroid location, size, and number must be considered. Myomectomy remains the preferred method for women with fibroid-related infertility who wish to have children or maintain fertility. Currently available medical therapies reduce symptoms in the short term but may involve side effects when used long term. Initial fertility studies are encouraging but trials are needed. Recent medical advances have led to minimally invasive approaches for women with fibroid disease, but there is a strong demand for additional treatment options.

### I. uterine fibroid embolization: preprocedure assessment [^112xakRk]. Techniques in Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2002). Low credibility.

Increasing clinical experience with uterine fibroid embolization (UFE) has improved the ability of interventionalist radiologists to discern who is and who is not an appropriate candidate for this procedure. Initial evaluation should be directed at obtaining answers to the following key questions: (1) Does the patient have uterine fibroids that account for her symptoms and are they severe enough to require invasive treatment? (2) Does she desire future childbearing? (3) Are there any clinical indications or imaging signs of uterine malignancy? (4) Are there any medical or anatomic features that would favor a particular therapeutic modality? (5) What are her own preferences regarding treatment? Ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging are vital elements to the assessment and planning of the appropriate course of action. Given the lack of prospective comparative trials between UFE and surgical treatment, recommendations are often highly influenced by patient preference.

### Uterine fibroid embolization [^116Qb6SU]. Techniques in Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2006). Low credibility.

Uterine fibroid embolization (UFE) is a minimally invasive therapy for the treatment of symptomatic uterine fibroids and offers an alternative to conventional myomectomy and hysterectomy. This review focuses on recent publications evaluating UFE and concludes that it is a safe treatment option, providing substantial improvement in both health-related quality of life and symptom control for most patients, with a very low rate of major complications. The durability of these outcomes appears similar to those obtained with myomectomy; however, a direct comparative long-term study is needed. Recent comparative studies have begun to provide more insight in to UFE outcomes compared with outcomes achieved with myomectomy and hysterectomy. UFE should be considered a first line therapy for women with symptomatic uterine fibroids. Additional research will continue to provide us with information as to the ideal candidates for UFE and may provide us with better tools to predict patient outcomes.

### A 41-year-old woman with menorrhagia, anemia, and fibroids: review of treatment of uterine fibroids [^114heV6L]. JAMA (2009). Excellent credibility.

Uterine fibroids are common tumors that can cause heavy menstrual bleeding, pelvic pressure symptoms, and reproductive disorders. The incidence of fibroids peaks in the fifth decade of age and they are more common in African American women. Often, fibroids are asymptomatic and require no treatment. However, the case of Ms P, a 41-year-old woman with recurrent uterine fibroids, menorrhagia, anemia, and fatigue who wishes to retain fertility, illustrates the symptoms that require treatment. Evaluation usually begins with a pelvic examination and an ultrasound to determine both the size and location of the fibroids within the uterus. Standard treatment of symptomatic fibroids is surgical removal by myomectomy or hysterectomy, depending in part on the desire for future fertility; new treatment options include uterine artery embolization via interventional radiologic techniques as well as various medical interventions. Several new therapies show promise but are still experimental at this time. The evidence for treatment options for Ms P and symptomatic patients with fibroids in general is discussed.

Surgical or interventional therapy

If medical management proves insufficient, surgical or interventional procedures are the next approach to treating symptomatic fibroids. A myomectomy (laparoscopic, hysteroscopic, or abdominal) removes fibroids to address symptomatic disease, but has a high rate of recurrence, requiring sequential treatment or a second line of therapy to manage the disease. While myomectomy preserves fertility, the cumulative risk of multiple surgeries must be considered when pursuing this course of action. Hysterectomy is the only definitive cure for fibroids, but eliminates the option of pregnancy and may have long-term health impacts. In fact, fibroids account for one-third of all hysterectomies.

The short- and long-term trade-offs of these procedures vary. Hysterectomy, even with ovarian conservation, affects ovarian function and leads to early menopause, but it shows better outcomes for fibroids within 3–5 years post-surgery, compared to other medical treatments. However, in the longer term, hysterectomy (particularly when conducted with oophorectomy) is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease, fracture risk, pelvic floor dysfunction, and neurologic issues. These complications are not fully understood and often are not adequately discussed with patients.

Endometrial ablation and uterine artery embolization are not only less invasive procedures but they also inhibit fertility. Alternatively, magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound (MRg-FUS) is an emerging noninvasive treatment recommended for patients who have fewer and larger fibroids. Patients report symptom improvement within the first 2 years, but one-third of women will need another procedure to treat recurrent disease. Because this is a new treatment, many providers do not know enough about it to offer this option, and MRg-FUS is not always covered by health insurance. The FDA has also cleared a laparoscopic, ultrasound-guided radiofrequency ablation therapy, an outpatient procedure that spares the uterus and allows for more rapid recovery. Pregnancy data concerning these emerging technologies are still limited.

Although conservative methods of treatment to preserve the uterus and fertility are often preferred, the likelihood of re-intervention increases with these approaches. With this comes the added burdens of cost, risk, and compromised emotional wellness of the patient. To help guide clinical decision-making, there is a need for additional comparative data on treatment options and their outcomes, as well as evidence-based algorithms to help predict patient responses to treatments. More research is also needed to identify less invasive treatment options without fertility-related drawbacks.

### Current treatment for symptomatic uterine fibroids: available evidence and therapeutic dilemmas [^117SawpK]. Lancet (2025). Excellent credibility.

This Review offers an evaluation of current treatments for symptomatic uterine fibroids, including uterine artery embolisation, MRI-guided high-intensity focused ultrasound, laparoscopic radiofrequency ablation, transcervical radiofrequency ablation, ulipristal acetate, and oral gonadotropin-releasing hormone antagonists with add-back therapy. Placing these therapies within the IDEAL (Idea, Development, Exploration, Assessment, And Long-Term Follow-Up) framework and the clinical phases of drug development framework, we highlight key gaps in the evidence such as the lack of head-to-head comparisons with standard care, scarce long-term data, and inadequate consideration of real-world fibroid and patient characteristics. We provide a clear overview, assess the strength of the available evidence, and propose a practical flowchart to help clinicians navigate treatment decisions, ensuring the best care for women with symptomatic fibroids at various stages of therapy development. Insight into these matters equips both patient and clinician with essential information to support the process of shared and fully informed decision making. Importantly, this Review also identifies knowledge gaps that contribute to the specification of the fibroid research agenda.

### Diagnosis and classification of uterine fibroids [^116Eas8b]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Medium credibility.

3.3 Bulk symptoms

Fibroids often cause bulk‐related symptoms due to their physical size and location. Patients commonly report pelvic pressure, lower back pain, abdominal discomfort, bloating, obstructive symptoms, and a sensation of pelvic fullness. Fibroids positioned anteriorly or posteriorly can compress the bladder or rectum, resulting in urinary frequency, difficulty emptying the bladder, or constipation. In severe cases, particularly large fibroids may lead to urinary obstruction or rare hydronephrosis. The extent and severity of these symptoms correlate with fibroid size, number, and anatomical placement within the uterus.

3.4 Quality of life

Symptomatic fibroids substantially diminish a patient's quality of life and productivity. The Uterine Fibroid Symptom and Health‐Related Quality of Life Questionnaire (UFS‐QoL) is a disease‐specific validated tool that effectively evaluates the impact of fibroids. It comprises two parts: (1) Symptom severity score evaluating bulk and pain symptoms, menstrual bleeding, and fatigue, with a score of 0–100, where higher scores mean increased fibroid burden; and (2) Health‐related quality of life (score of 0–100) that evaluates domains such as concern, activity, energy/mood, control, self‐consciousness, and sexual function, where a higher score is indicative of a better quality of life. Patients with moderate to severe fibroid symptoms report significantly reduced quality of life, increased healthcare utilization, greater reliance on analgesics and iron supplements, and considerable loss of productivity, including frequent absence from work. Surveys demonstrate widespread impacts extending to sexual life, work performance, and relationships, highlighting the extensive socioeconomic burden posed by symptomatic uterine fibroids.

### Fibroids: yet another example of disparity in health? [^112MtFyV]. BMC Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Providing rapid and effective reproductive and maternal health is a core hallmark of a well-functioning society. Whilst women comprise half of all people in society, the importance of healthcare aspects specific to them is often de-prioritised. Following the recent anniversary of Fibroid Awareness Month in July, we focus on this under-discussed disorder, female reproductive health and why further action is needed to improve outcomes.

Female reproductive health encompasses healthcare and research related to the specific issues women face over the course of a lifetime. Dysfunction in the interplay of female reproductive organs and complex hormonal expression rhythms can cause a variety of disorders only experienced by women. Cancer of the Cervix, ovaries and endometrium, heavy menstrual bleeds, Uterine disorders, pre-, peri- and post-natal disorders are just a few examples of issues faced only by women. Fibroids are an example of a disorder faced by women with a challenging etiology and potential long term impact on quality of life.

Fibroids or Leiomyomas are benign smooth muscle tumours which form spontaneously in the pelvic and lower extremity. Whilst extremely rare cases have been identified in men, the tumours are most frequently found in the uterus. These masses can vary in size, and some rare recent case studies have identified fibroid masses larger than 5kg. In many cases, women with fibroids are asymptomatic. However, fibroids can cause abdominal or lower back pain, constipation, increased urination, pain during intercourse, heavy and/or painful periods and potential pregnancy complications or infertility, and thus can severely affect a woman's quality of life. The severity of symptoms varies and depends on the uterine location, number and size of fibroids present. Fibroids located submucosally, which then distort and invade the womb, are of particular concern for future pregnancies and fertility.

### Pathogenesis of uterine fibroids: current understanding and future directions [^116E1WW4]. Fertility and Sterility (2024). Medium credibility.

Fibroids are benign uterine tumors characterized by the proliferation of uterine smooth muscle cells, embedded in an abundant extracellular matrix. Their prevalence is estimated to be > 50% in women aged > 45 years. Fibroids represent a considerable health burden. It is time to acquire a deeper mechanistic understanding of uterine fibroid-related etiology and pathogenesis, which may help pinpoint new strategies and an individualized approach. There is a need to gather prospective data and conduct studies to compare alternative approaches and assess long-term outcomes with respect to quality of life, recurrence of symptoms (bleeding and bulk symptoms), fertility, and even complications The goal of this review was to evaluate the widely accepted pathogenesis and identify risks factors and future directions for clinical and basic research into fibroids.

39 Vaginal hysterectomy is the preferred technique because it provides several statistically significant advantages, including shorter surgery time than total laparoscopic hysterectomy or laparoscopically assisted vaginal hysterectomy, decreased blood loss, shorter hospitalization, and shorter paralytic ileus time; however, vaginal hysterectomy is limited by the size of the myomatous uterus. 43 Abdominal hysterectomy is an alternative approach, but the balance of risks and benefits must be individualized to each patient.

### Uterine fibroid embolisation for symptomatic uterine fibroids: a survey of clinical practice in Europe [^117MSxsY]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

Uterine fibroids are the most common benign tumours in women of childbearing age. Symptomatic fibroids can cause a diversity of symptoms, which can be divided into four categories: bleeding symptoms (irregular and/or heavy menstrual bleeding), pain (in the pelvic region and the back), bulk-related symptoms (pressure on bladder and bowel as well as increase in abdominal circumference), and subfertility. These symptoms often lead to medical or surgical treatments.

During the last two decades, minimally invasive therapeutic options for uterine fibroids have increased considerably. Uterine fibroid embolisation (UFE) was introduced in 1994 and is currently a well acknowledged and proven alternative to surgical treatment.

UFE is a percutaneous trancatheter embolisation technique using embolisation material to occlude the (end-)arteries supplying the fibroid. Devascularisation causes infarction and consequently decreased fibroid size, which may result in effective alleviation of symptoms.

However, after the introduction of UFE as an alternative to more invasive approaches, a real widespread breakthrough, especially in general interventional radiology (IR), did not occur.

Information on UFE still seems to be unavailable to a large number of women in Europe, and many gynaecologists do not provide the option of UFE, or they inaccurately inform patients, using misleading facts. Specific data on the number of centres and interventionalists performing UFE in Europe and the number of UFE procedures per centre do not exist.

This publication reports the outcome of a survey among European interventional radiologists concerning UFE treatment. The purpose of this study was to determine actual data on the current clinical practice of UFE in European countries.

### The comparing options for management: PAtient-centered REsults for uterine fibroids (COMPARE-UF) registry: rationale and design [^115nxZJP]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Uterine fibroids are common in premenopausal women, yet comparative effectiveness research on uterine fibroid treatments is rare.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to design and establish a uterine fibroid registry based in the United States to provide comparative effectiveness data regarding uterine fibroid treatment.

Study Design

We report here the design and initial recruitment for the Comparing Options for Management: Patient-centered REsults for Uterine Fibroids (COMPARE-UF) registry (Clinicaltrials.gov, NCT02260752), funded by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality in collaboration with the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute. COMPARE-UF was designed to help answer critical questions about treatment options for women with symptomatic uterine fibroids. Women who undergo a procedure for uterine fibroids (hysterectomy, myomectomy [abdominal, hysteroscopic, vaginal, and laparoscopic/robotic], endometrial ablation, radiofrequency fibroid ablation, uterine artery embolization, magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound, or progestin-releasing intrauterine device insertion) at 1 of the COMPARE-UF sites are invited to participate in a prospective registry with 3 years follow up for postprocedural outcomes. Enrolled participants provide annual follow-up evaluation through an online portal or through traditional phone contact. A central data abstraction center provides information obtained from imaging, operative or procedural notes, and pathology reports. Women with uterine fibroids and other stakeholders are a key part of the COMPARE-UF registry and participate at all points from study design to dissemination of results.

Results

We built a network of 9 clinical sites across the United States with expertise in the care of women with uterine fibroids to capture geographic, racial, ethnic, and procedural diversity. Of the initial 2031 women who were enrolled in COMPARE-UF, 42% are self-identified as black or African American, and 40% are ≤ 40 years old, with 16% of participants < 35 years old. Women who undergo myomectomy comprise the largest treatment group at 46% of all procedures, with laparoscopic or robotic myomectomy comprising the largest subset of myomectomies at 19% of all procedures. Hysterectomy is the second most common treatment within the registry at 38%.

Conclusion

In response to priorities that were identified by our patient stakeholders, the initial aims within COMPARE-UF will address how different procedures that are used to treat uterine fibroids compare in terms of long-lasting symptom relief, potential for recurrence, medical complications, improvement in quality of life and sexual function, age at menopause, and fertility and pregnancy outcomes. COMPARE-UF will generate evidence on the comparative effectiveness of different procedural options for uterine fibroids and help patients and their caregivers make informed decisions that best meet an individual patient's short- and long-term preferences. Building on this infrastructure, the COMPARE-UF team of investigators and stakeholders, including patients, collaborate to identify future priorities for expanding the registry, such as assessing the efficacy of medical therapies for uterine fibroids. COMPARE-UF results will be disseminated directly to patients, providers, and other stakeholders by traditional academic pathways and by innovative methods that include a variety of social media platforms. Given demographic differences among women who undergo different uterine fibroid treatments, the assessment of comparative effectiveness for this disease through clinical trials will remain difficult. Therefore, this registry provides optimized evidence to help patients and their providers better understand the pros and cons of different treatment options so that they can make more informed decisions.

### Conservative surgical management of uterine myomas [^117SJCqB]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

Uterine fibroids are a major gynecologic problem in American women, and several alternatives have been developed. Conservative treatment, with the goal of treating the fibroid but retaining the uterus, is a frequent choice among women who require therapy during their early to middle reproductive years. A variety of conservative surgical approaches exist; each has advantages and disadvantages for the clinician and the patient. Some are well-established techniques, whereas others are still in the investigational stage. None has been evaluated adequately for its effects on future fertility. To this end, it is imperative that investigators continue to evaluate these surgical procedures so that the clinician can provide accurate and comprehensive information when faced with a patient who desires one or more of these approaches. Furthermore, it is critical for the practitioner to stay informed about these procedures so that patients can be given a full complement of options.

### Uterine fibroids [^117NRG8V]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2016). Medium credibility.

Uterine fibroids (also known as leiomyomas or myomas) are common clonal neoplasms of the uterus. Fibroids have both smooth muscle and fibroblast components, in addition to a substantial amount of fibrous extracellular matrix, which all contribute to the pathogenetic process. Fibroids are extremely heterogeneous in their pathophysiology, size, location and clinical symptomatology. They are also a part of a range of disease in which some variants have facets of malignant behaviour but overall are benign. Risk for fibroids is associated with race; black women have a higher risk of developing fibroids earlier in life than their white counterparts and also develop more-severe forms of the disease. Clinically, fibroids account for one-third to half of all hysterectomies and are associated with substantial morbidity and health care costs for women of reproductive age. Indeed, current treatments are primarily surgical and interventional; approximately three-quarters of all fibroid treatments are hysterectomies. However, clinical innovations are emerging in the use of progesterone receptor modulators as a medical therapy. New information is rapidly accumulating about the genetic subgroups that lead to fibroid formation, which might aid further understanding of the clinical heterogeneity of this disease and lead to individualized treatments. This information is a crucial development given the current lack of high-quality evidence on which to base therapeutic decisions.

### Uterine fibroids [^113mHfya]. Lancet (2001). Excellent credibility.

Uterine leiomyomas (fibroids or myomas), benign tumours of the human uterus, are the single most common indication for hysterectomy. They are clinically apparent in up to 25% of women and cause significant morbidity, including prolonged or heavy menstrual bleeding, pelvic pressure or pain, and, in rare cases, reproductive dysfunction. Thus, both the economic cost and the effect on quality of life are substantial. Surgery has been the mainstay of fibroid treatment, and various minimally invasive procedures have been developed in addition to hysterectomy and abdominal myomectomy. Formation of new leiomyomas after these conservative therapies remains a substantial problem. Although medications that manipulate concentrations of steroid hormones are effective, side-effects limit long-term use. A better approach may be manipulation of the steroid-hormone environment with specific hormone antagonists. There has been little evidence-based evaluation of therapy. New research into the basic biology of these neoplasms may add new treatment options for the future as the role of growth factors and genetic mutations in these tumours are better understood.

### Alternatives to hysterectomy: management of uterine fibroids [^116czfdS]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Uterine fibroids are a common condition that can be debilitating and are the leading benign cause of hysterectomy. Women often live with the symptoms rather than choose hysterectomy, but survey studies have shown that work, social life, and physical activities are hindered by fibroid symptoms. Offering alternative therapies tailored to a woman's symptoms will allow her to choose a treatment that fits her needs and to preserve her uterus and fertility. The minimally invasive treatment options have a faster recovery and lower surgical risk than hysterectomy, but may require reintervention. One pharmacologic treatment offers short-term, intermittent therapy with lasting effects.

### Minimally invasive surgical techniques versus open myomectomy for uterine fibroids [^112Rrwku]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Fibroids are common benign tumours arising in the uterus. Myomectomy is the surgical treatment of choice for women with symptomatic fibroids who prefer or want uterine conservation. Myomectomy can be performed by conventional laparotomy, by mini-laparotomy or by minimal access techniques such as hysteroscopy and laparoscopy.

Objectives

To determine the benefits and harms of laparoscopic or hysteroscopic myomectomy compared with open myomectomy.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (inception to July 2014), the Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group (MDSG) Specialised Register of Controlled Trials (inception to July 2014), MEDLINE(R) (inception to July 2014), EMBASE (inception to July 2014), PsycINFO (inception to July 2014) and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) (inception to July 2014) to identify relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs). We also searched trial registers and references from selected relevant trials and review articles. We applied no language restriction in these searches.

Selection Criteria

All published and unpublished randomised controlled trials comparing myomectomy via laparotomy, mini-laparotomy or laparoscopically assisted mini-laparotomy versus laparoscopy or hysteroscopy in premenopausal women with uterine fibroids diagnosed by clinical and ultrasound examination were included in the meta-analysis.

Data Collection and Analysis

We conducted study selection and extracted data in duplicate. Primary outcomes were postoperative pain, reported in six studies, and in-hospital adverse events, reported in eight studies. Secondary outcomes included length of hospital stay, reported in four studies, operating time, reported in eight studies and recurrence of fibroids, reported in three studies. Each of the other secondary outcomes-improvement in menstrual symptoms, change in quality of life, repeat myomectomy and hysterectomy at a later date-was reported in a single study. Odds ratios (ORs), mean differences (MDs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated and data combined using the fixed-effect model. The quality of evidence was assessed using Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methods.

Main Results

We found 23 potentially relevant trials, of which nine were eligible for inclusion in this review. The nine trials included in our meta-analysis had a total of 808 women. The overall risk of bias of included studies was low, as most studies properly reported their methods. Postoperative pain: Postoperative pain was measured on a visual analogue scale (VAS), with zero meaning 'no pain at all' and 10 signifying 'pain as bad as it could be'.Postoperative pain was significantly less, as determined by subjectively assessed pain score at six hours (MD -2.40, 95% CI -2.88 to -1.92, one study, 148 women, moderate-quality evidence) and 48 hours postoperatively (MD -1.90, 95% CI -2.80 to -1.00, two studies, 80 women, I² = 0%, moderate-quality evidence) in the laparoscopic myomectomy group compared with the open myomectomy group. This means that among women undergoing laparoscopic myomectomy, mean pain score at six hours and 48 hours would be likely to range from about three points lower to one point lower on a VAS zero-to-10 scale. No significant difference in postoperative pain score was noted between the laparoscopic and open myomectomy groups at 24 hours (MD -0.29, 95% CI -0.7 to 0.12, four studies, 232 women, I² = 43%, moderate-quality evidence). The overall quality of these findings is moderate; therefore further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate. In-hospital adverse events: No evidence suggested a difference in unscheduled return to theatre (OR 3.04, 95% CI 0.12 to 75.86, two studies, 188 women, I² = 0%, low-quality evidence) and laparoconversion (OR 1.11, 95% CI 0.44 to 2.83, eight studies, 756 women, I² = 53%, moderate-quality evidence) when open myomectomy was compared with laparoscopic myomectomy. Only one study including 148 women reported injury to pelvic organs (no events were described in other studies), and no significant difference was noted between laparoscopic myomectomy and laparoscopically assisted mini-laparotomy myomectomy (OR 3.04, 95% CI 0.12 to 75.86). Significantly lower risk of postoperative fever was observed in the laparoscopic myomectomy group compared with groups treated with all types of open myomectomy (OR 0.44, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.77, I² = 0%, six studies, 635 women). This indicates that among women undergoing laparoscopic myomectomy, the risk of postoperative fever is 50% lower than among those treated with open surgery. No studies reported immediate hysterectomy, uterine rupture, thromboembolism or mortality. Six studies including 549 women reported haemoglobin drop, but these studies were not pooled because of extreme heterogeneity (I² = 97%) and therefore could not be included in the analysis.

Authors' Conclusions

Laparoscopic myomectomy is a procedure associated with less subjectively reported postoperative pain, lower postoperative fever and shorter hospital stay compared with all types of open myomectomy. No evidence suggested a difference in recurrence risk between laparoscopic and open myomectomy. More studies are needed to assess rates of uterine rupture, occurrence of thromboembolism, need for repeat myomectomy and hysterectomy at a later stage.

### Epidemiology and management of uterine fibroids [^111ju2Zk]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Uterine leiomyomas are one of the most common and yet understudied diseases in women. These tumors, commonly known as fibroids, affect women mainly during their reproductive years and are diagnosed in up to 70% of white women and more than 80% of women of African ancestry during their lifetime. This disease has a profound impact on health care delivery and costs worldwide. Though most women with fibroids are asymptomatic, approximately 30% of them will present with severe symptoms which can include abnormal uterine bleeding, anemia, pelvic pain and pressure, back pain, urinary frequency, constipation, or infertility, and will require intervention. Furthermore, fibroids have been associated with poor obstetrical outcomes. The current options for symptomatic fibroid treatment include expectant, medical, and surgical management, and interventional radiology procedures. This article reviews the recent progress and available management strategies for uterine fibroids and highlights areas where further research is needed to find new therapeutic targets and better personalize treatments.

### Uterine fibroids: rapid evidence review [^111xxUQ9]. American Family Physician (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for uterine fibroids, more specifically with respect to hormone therapy, AAFP 2025 guidelines recommend to offer GnRH antagonists as an effective medical treatment for abnormal uterine bleeding associated with leiomyomas. Combine with hormonal add-back therapy, including estradiol and norethindrone, to minimize adverse effects and allow use for up to 2 years.
