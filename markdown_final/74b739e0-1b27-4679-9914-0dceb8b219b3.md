Which of the following is indicated?

Group of answer choices

Retest in 3–4 weeks after treatment

Retest in 3–6 months

Retest is not necessary

Retest before delivery

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which follow-up testing strategy is appropriate for a pregnant 20-year-old who was treated for Chlamydia trachomatis at 13 weeks' gestation, with options including retesting in 3–4 weeks, 3–6 months, not retesting, or retesting before delivery. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the most authoritative guideline source for pregnancy-specific management. Then, I should verify the exact timing of the test-of-cure and the rationale for that interval. Next, I will review the recommendation for reinfection screening and how pregnancy timing influences when that should occur. After that, I should consider the patient's risk profile and whether third-trimester screening is indicated. Finally, I will reconcile any conflicting guidance and synthesize a clear, clinically actionable answer with supporting references.

> Let me first confirm the guideline anchor. For pregnant patients with chlamydia, the CDC Sexually Transmitted Infections Treatment Guidelines, 2021, are the most authoritative and specific source, and they explicitly recommend a test of cure and reinfection screening in pregnancy, which I should prioritize over nonpregnant-focused guidance [^112aFqqT].

> I need to check the exact timing of the test-of-cure. The CDC recommends performing a test of cure at approximately 4 weeks after therapy completion in pregnancy to document eradication, using NAAT, because of the potential for persistent infection and serious maternal–neonatal sequelae if infection remains. This corresponds to about 3–4 weeks post-treatment, which aligns with the earliest option presented [^112aFqqT].

> Wait, let me verify the rationale for that interval. Testing earlier than about 3 weeks risks false positives from residual nonviable nucleic acid, whereas waiting until 4 weeks balances clearance kinetics with timely detection of treatment failure or persistence. Observational cohorts in pregnancy show that when repeat testing is done at or beyond 21 days, meaningful rates of persistence and recurrence are detected, supporting the 4‑week test-of-cure approach [^111KpJAM] [^111owMcP].

> Next, I should review reinfection screening. The CDC advises that all pregnant women treated for chlamydia be retested 3 months after treatment to detect reinfection, and that women aged under 25 years or those at increased risk also be screened again in the third trimester. Given this patient is 20 years old, third-trimester screening is indicated even if the 3‑month retest falls earlier in gestation [^112aFqqT] [^1157rG5a].

> Hold on, I should verify how this maps to the provided options. The 3–4 week window matches the test-of-cure at approximately 4 weeks, the 3–6 month window corresponds to the 3‑month reinfection screening, and "retest before delivery" reflects the third‑trimester screening recommendation for young or high‑risk pregnant patients. "No retesting" is not appropriate in pregnancy given CDC guidance for both test-of-cure and reinfection screening [^112aFqqT].

> But wait, what if I'm conflating nonpregnant and pregnant guidance. Initially, I almost said routine test-of-cure is not recommended for nonpregnant patients treated with first‑line regimens, which is true, but that does not apply to pregnancy; in pregnancy, test-of-cure is specifically recommended regardless of regimen, so I should not let nonpregnant guidance override pregnancy-specific requirements here [^111KpJAM] [^112aFqqT].

> I should also consider risk modifiers. Young age under 25 years is a strong predictor of incident and recurrent chlamydia, and coinfections such as gonorrhea or syphilis further increase the risk of persistent or recurrent chlamydia in pregnancy. Therefore, adhering to the CDC's test-of-cure and reinfection screening schedule is especially prudent in this patient profile [^1157rG5a] [^112jkwxD] [^111owMcP].

> Let me synthesize the clinical plan. The most immediate and specific next step is a test-of-cure at about 4 weeks after azithromycin to document eradication, followed by reinfection screening at 3 months. Because she is 20 years old, she should also be screened again in the third trimester, ideally around 28–32 weeks, to mitigate reinfection risk before delivery and neonatal exposure [^112aFqqT] [^1157rG5a].

> Conclusion: Among the choices, retesting in 3–4 weeks is the indicated next step to fulfill the CDC-recommended test-of-cure in pregnancy. Subsequent retesting at 3 months and again in the third trimester should be arranged to detect reinfection, with partner management and abstinence counseling to reduce recurrence risk [^112aFqqT] [^1157rG5a].

---

The correct answer is **retest in 3–4 weeks** [^112aFqqT] after treatment to confirm eradication with a test-of-cure, because pregnancy increases the risk of persistent or recurrent infection and azithromycin is not 100% effective [^1122iySo]. Retesting at 3–6 months is also recommended to detect reinfection, but the most immediate and critical step is the 3–4 week test-of-cure [^112aFqqT]. Retesting before delivery is advised if the 3–4 week test is not done or if risk remains high [^113QThoH].

---

## Rationale for retesting in pregnancy

Pregnant women are at **increased risk** of persistent or recurrent chlamydia infection due to physiological and immunological changes during pregnancy [^notfound]. Untreated or persistent chlamydia infection during pregnancy can lead to significant maternal and neonatal complications, including:

- Preterm delivery [^116SoaG4]
- Low birth weight [^116SoaG4]
- Premature rupture of membranes [^116SoaG4]
- Postpartum endometritis [^113m6END]
- Neonatal conjunctivitis [^111pf5nZ]
- Neonatal pneumonia [^112ijsQt]

Given these risks, **it is essential to ensure** that the infection has been adequately treated and eradicated.

---

## Recommended timing for retesting

The CDC and ACOG provide **clear guidance** on the timing of retesting for chlamydia infection in pregnant women:

- **Test of cure (TOC)**: Retest approximately 3–4 weeks after completion of treatment to confirm eradication of the infection [^112aFqqT] [^11767EVV].
- **Retesting for reinfection**: Retest again at 3 months after treatment to detect possible reinfection or recurrence [^112aFqqT] [^111KpJAM].
- **Third trimester screening**: If the initial test of cure is not performed or if the patient remains at high risk, retest again in the third trimester (around 28–32 weeks gestation) [^1157rG5a] [^113RUuJn].

---

## Evidence supporting retesting at 3–4 weeks

Recent studies highlight the **importance of early retesting** in pregnant women treated for chlamydia infection:

- A study by Goje et al. (2020) found that persistent or recurrent chlamydia infection occurred in nearly 1 in 4 pregnancies after azithromycin treatment, emphasizing the need for a test of cure [^1122iySo] [^111owMcP].
- The median time to retesting in clinical practice was approximately 30 days, aligning with the recommended 3–4 week window [^117Uta99] [^113ZbQhd].
- Early retesting allows for timely detection and management of persistent or recurrent infection, reducing the risk of maternal and neonatal complications [^112aFqqT].

---

## Clinical implications of not retesting

Failure to retest within the recommended timeframe can have **significant clinical consequences**:

- Persistent infection may go undetected, increasing the risk of preterm delivery, low birth weight, and neonatal infection [^116SoaG4].
- Reinfection from untreated partners is common, with recurrence rates reported as high as 14% in some cohorts [^113ZbQhd] [^111KpJAM].
- Lack of retesting undermines the effectiveness of screening and treatment programs, perpetuating transmission and complications [^111KpJAM].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Retesting timeframe** | **Rationale** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|-|
| 3–4 weeks | Confirm eradication of infection (test of cure) | Strongly recommended |
| 3 months | Detect reinfection or recurrence | Strongly recommended |
| third trimester (28–32 weeks) | Additional screening for high-risk patients or if initial test of cure not performed | Recommended |

---

## Conclusion and clinical recommendation

Retesting a pregnant woman treated for chlamydia infection is essential to ensure eradication and prevent maternal and neonatal complications. The most appropriate timeframe for retesting is **3–4 weeks** after treatment completion to confirm cure, with additional retesting at 3 months and in the third trimester if risk remains high. This approach aligns with CDC and ACOG guidelines and is supported by recent evidence highlighting the high rates of persistent or recurrent infection in pregnancy [^112aFqqT] [^1157rG5a] [^1122iySo].

### Chlamydia (uncomplicated, genital) [^111oCJDC]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2010). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Genital chlamydia is the most commonly reported bacterial sexually transmitted infection (STI) in developed countries. In women, infection occurs most commonly between the ages of 16 and 19 years.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of antibiotic treatment for men and non-pregnant women with uncomplicated genital chlamydial infection?What are the effects of antibiotic treatment for pregnant women with uncomplicated genital chlamydial infection? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to September 2009 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 24 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: amoxicillin, ampicillin, azithromycin, ciprofloxacin, clarithromycin, clindamycin, doxycycline, erythromycin, lymecycline, minocycline, ofloxacin, pivampicillin, rifampicin, roxithromycin, sparfloxacin, tetracycline, and trovafloxacin.

### Pregnancy outcome following gestational exposure to azithromycin [^113SRFHU]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2006). Low credibility.

Conclusion

The results of this prospective study of 123 pregnant women exposed to azithromycin do not suggest that there is a greater risk for major malformations above the baseline rate of 1%–3%. This evidence-based data will be particularly useful for health care providers in their decision-making, regarding the treatment of pregnant women for infections such as chlamydia when azithromycin is considered to be the drug of choice.

Other Management Considerations

Patients should be followed clinically until signs and symptoms have resolved. Persons who receive an LGV diagnosis should be tested for other STIs, especially HIV, gonorrhea, and syphilis. Those whose HIV test results are negative should be offered HIV PrEP.

Follow-Up

All persons who have been treated for LGV should be retested for chlamydia approximately 3 months after treatment. If retesting at 3 months is not possible, providers should retest at the patient's next visit for medical care within the 12-month period after initial treatment.

Management of Sex Partners

Persons who have had sexual contact with a patient who has LGV within the 60 days before onset of the patient's symptoms should be evaluated, examined, and tested for chlamydial infection, depending on anatomic site of exposure. Asymptomatic partners should be presumptively treated with a chlamydia regimen (doxycycline 100 mg orally 2 times/day for 7 days).

Special Considerations

Pregnancy

Use of doxycycline in pregnancy might be associated with discoloration of teeth; however, the risk is not well defined. Doxycycline is compatible with breastfeeding. Azithromycin might prove useful for LGV treatment during pregnancy, at a presumptive dose of 1 g weekly for 3 weeks; no published data are available regarding an effective dose and duration of treatment. Pregnant and lactating women with LGV can be treated with erythromycin, although this regimen is associated with frequent gastrointestinal side effects. Pregnant women treated for LGV should have a test of cure performed 4 weeks after the initial C. trachomatis NAAT-positive test.

HIV Infection

Persons with LGV and HIV infection should receive the same regimens as those who do not have HIV. Prolonged therapy might be required because a delay in resolution of symptoms might occur.

### Screening for Chlamydia and gonorrhea: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^116SoaG4]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

Chlamydia screening benefits and pregnancy outcomes — The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) reviewed 4 trials and concluded that screening was associated with reduced risk of PID vs no screening. The USPSTF previously found fair-quality evidence that treatment of chlamydial infection during pregnancy is associated with improved outcomes for infants and mothers, and cohort screening studies at the first prenatal visit in pregnant women with a total of 11 544 participants at increased risk for infection found treatment was associated with significantly lower rates of preterm delivery, early rupture of membranes, and infants with low birth weight compared with no treatment or treatment failure. The USPSTF found little direct evidence on the effectiveness of screening for chlamydia in men or low-risk women and found no studies on the benefits of screening women, including pregnant women, who are not at increased risk for infection.

### Treatment of uncomplicated genital Chlamydia trachomatis infections in adults [^116mdQdw]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

To prepare the 2001 sexually transmitted disease treatment guidelines of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, recently published articles and abstracts concerning advances in the treatment of uncomplicated Chlamydia trachomatis genital infections in adults were reviewed. Questions about treatments were posed and answered according to the results of efficacy studies and clinical trials. Recent studies have continued to demonstrate the similar efficacy of doxycycline and azithromycin. Because compliance with doxycyline remains a concern, administration of single-dose azithromycin therapy in the clinic presents a potential advantage for patients whose adherence is questionable. Because few systematically collected data have been published concerning the safety and efficacy of azithromycin use in pregnancy, the guidelines continue to recommend treatment with erythromycin or amoxicillin. Nevertheless, because of azithromycin's less frequent side effects and improved adherence, increasing numbers of obstetricians in the United States are using azithromyin to treat pregnant women with uncomplicated C. trachomatis infections.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for Chlamydia trachomatis infection, more specifically with respect to follow-up testing, BASHH/IUSTI 2016 guidelines recommend to obtain testing of cure in the following circumstances:

- pregnancy

- complicated infections

- persisting symptoms

- treatment with second-line or third-line regimens

- non-compliance to therapy

- suspected re-exposure to infection.

### Effect of monthly intermittent preventive treatment with dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine with and without azithromycin versus monthly sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine on adverse pregnancy outcomes in Africa: a double-blind randomised, partly placebo-controlled trial [^113BwtH3]. Lancet (2023). Excellent credibility.

The number of serious adverse events was similar across all three groups in mothers and infants. IPTp with dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine was well tolerated, which is essential for drugs used for chemoprevention when most recipients are asymptomatic. Although dizziness, vomiting, and nausea were more frequently reported in the dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine groups than in the sulfadoxine–pyrimethamine group, these adverse events were reported by less than 5% of participants and did not affect adherence or dropouts. However, the addition of azithromycin resulted in significantly more vomiting than with dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine alone.

Furthermore, adding azithromycin to dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine was not associated with a reduction in the composite primary endpoint of adverse pregnancy outcomes, any of the individual components of the composite primary endpoint, or a reduction in STIs and bacterial vaginosis. The high prevalence of curable STIs and bacterial vaginosis at enrolment (16·9%) in this study, which is similar to that reported in a meta-analysis, highlights the importance of accurate diagnosis and treatment of curable STIs and other RTIs as part of antenatal care in sub-Saharan Africa. The evidence base of the benefits of adding azithromycin to IPTp in malaria-endemic settings is contradictory.

We considered more frequent doses of azithromycin during pregnancy at the design stage. However, after discussion with WHO, this idea was disregarded in favour of a single dose of azithromycin because of concerns about the potential effect of azithromycin on macrolide resistance when given presumptively several times in pregnancy to all pregnant women even when asymptomatic. None of the pregnancy studies summarised, including our trial, involved partner screening and treatment for STIs; therefore, reinfection cannot be ruled out. The risk of reinfection is an important consideration, which might explain the superior effect of sulfadoxine–pyrimethamine on chlamydia infection. Women in the dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine plus azithromycin group received 2 g of azithromycin at the enrolment visit, double the WHO-recommended first-line treatment for chlamydia (1 g on 1 day). By contrast, participants in the IPTp with sulfadoxine–pyrimethamine group received a median of five courses of 1·5 g of sulfadoxine throughout pregnancy. Sulfadoxine is a sulfonamide derivative. Sulfisoxazole, another sulfonamide, which inhibits Chlamydia trachomatis, was used to treat chlamydia in the 1980s.

### High rates of persistent and recurrent Chlamydia in pregnant women after treatment with azithromycin [^113wCnta]. American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology MFM (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Chlamydia trachomatis is a common bacterial sexually transmitted infection that can persist or recur after antibiotic treatment. Universal screening for chlamydia in pregnancy is recommended to prevent adverse birth outcomes. Single-dose oral azithromycin has been the first-line therapy for chlamydia in pregnancy since 2006.

Objective

In the setting of limited data and rising sexually transmitted infection rates in the United States, our goal was to document rates and risk factors for persistent or recurrent chlamydia after azithromycin treatment in pregnancy.

Study Design

This retrospective cohort study included pregnancies with urogenital chlamydia and follow-up testing in women who delivered at an Alabama facility between November 2012 and December 2017. Pregnancies with prescribed azithromycin therapy and repeat chlamydia testing ≥ 21 days later were included. Chlamydia trachomatis nucleic acid amplification testing was performed on genital swab or urine samples. Descriptive characteristics and birth outcomes were compared for categories stratified by repeat test results: persistence (+ +), recurrence (+ - +), or clearance (+ -). Logistic regression models were used to identify demographic and clinical risk factors for persistent or recurrent chlamydia in pregnancy.

Results

Among 810 women with 840 pregnancies with repeat chlamydia testing after azithromycin treatment, 114 (14%) had persistence and an additional 72 (9%) had recurrence later in pregnancy. The median time to repeat testing was 30 days (interquartile range, 24–49 days). Concomitant gonorrhea or syphilis in pregnancy was independently associated with persistent or recurrent chlamydia (adjusted odds ratio, 1.6; 95% confidence interval, 1.1–2.4).

Conclusion

Persistent or recurrent chlamydia after azithromycin treatment was detected in nearly 1 in 4 pregnancies with repeat testing in our urban center, highlighting the importance of performing a test of cure and ensuring partner therapy to reduce recurrent chlamydia risk.

### Diagnosis and treatment of Chlamydia trachomatis infection [^1166ZV3i]. American Family Physician (2006). Low credibility.

Chlamydia trachomatis infection most commonly affects the urogenital tract. In men, the infection usually is symptomatic, with dysuria and a discharge from the penis. Untreated chlamydial infection in men can spread to the epididymis. Most women with chlamydial infection have minimal or no symptoms, but some develop pelvic inflammatory disease. Chlamydial infection in newborns can cause ophthalmia neonatorum. Chlamydial pneumonia can occur at one to three months of age, manifesting as a protracted onset of staccato cough, usually without wheezing or fever. Treatment options for uncomplicated urogenital infections include a single 1-g dose of azithromycin orally, or doxycycline at a dosage of 100 mg orally twice per day for seven days. The recommended treatment during pregnancy is erythromycin base or amoxicillin. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommend screening for chlamydial infection in women at increased risk of infection and in all women younger than 25 years.

### Weighing potential benefits and harms of Mycoplasma genitalium testing and treatment approaches [^112boCTm]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Tests of Cure

Tests of cure are undertaken to confirm pathogen eradication, preventing transmission and reinfection. Because NAATs detect both viable and nonviable DNA/RNA, explicit time frames for tests of cure have been outlined, ranging from 7–14 days after therapy for pharyngeal gonorrhea to ≈28 days for chlamydia in pregnant persons. Macrolide-sensitive M. genitalium infections are cleared relatively quickly after azithromycin therapy; when tests of cure are performed, the timeframe is similar to that for gonorrhea and chlamydia. Australian guidelines recommend a test of cure 14–21 days after treatment.

Benefits of Tests of Cure

The primary benefit of tests of cure is verifying that the organism has been successfully eradicated, which is key for pathogens that cause serious sequelae, particularly during asymptomatic infection. Because M. genitalium sometimes recrudesces after symptoms resolve, a test of cure would identify the need for additional therapy earlier, in turn reducing the risk of infecting sex partners, potentially with resistant strains not detected initially or selected during treatment. Finally, patients might appreciate confirmation that they are cured and not contagious.

Harms of Tests of Cure

A positive test of cure indicates either treatment failure or reinfection. Cases of reinfection are usually retreated with the same antibiotic, whereas cases of treatment failure are typically treated with an alternative antibiotic. When the risk for long-term sequelae is high, the benefit of assuring eradication outweighs the harm of additional antibiotic pressure. When the risk for sequelae is low or uncertain, the potential harm of additional antibiotics might outweigh the benefit of confirming eradication. Despite some evidence that M. genitalium can result in adverse sequelae in women, numerous outstanding questions about natural history remain. These questions include uncertainty over the frequency of upper reproductive tract sequelae, frequency of spontaneous clearance, clinical significance of asymptomatic infections, and transmission risk with low organism load that persists after treatment. Given these outstanding questions, the benefit of tests of cure is currently unknown. The 2021 CDC treatment guidelines only recommend tests of cure when resistance testing is not available and moxifloxacin cannot be used.

Which Antimicrobial Therapies Should Be Used against M. genitalium?

Azithromycin (1 g, 1 dose) was recommended over doxycycline (100 mg 2×/d for 7 days) for M. genitalium in the 2015 treatment guidelines. Moxifloxacin was recommended for azithromycin treatment failures. The 2021 guidelines removed single-dose azithromycin from recommended therapies, primarily because of increasing antimicrobial resistance.

### Assessment of syndromic management of curable sexually transmitted and reproductive tract infections among pregnant women: an observational cross-sectional study [^114s2xZ2]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2021). Medium credibility.

Chlamydia and gonorrhoea

Chlamydia and gonorrhoea POC tests merit investigation. Given that each test represents a fixed-cost, it would be useful to explore whether the use of POC tests among women who are at risk of chlamydia and gonorrhoea might be able to achieve similar reductions in adverse pregnancy outcomes attributable to these infections as universal screening and case management. In this study group, no specific risk factors for women who had chlamydial infection were identified. Consequently, universal POC testing should be considered in this setting first and foremost until a more targeted approach can be established based on risk profiles for chlamydial infection in this population. In the case of gonorrhoea, universal POC testing should be evaluated against an approach of targeted screening for pregnant women under 30 years of age, or those with HIV infection.

It would be important to establish differential diagnoses between chlamydia and gonorrhoea due of treatment implications, even though just three of 90 (3.3%) pregnant women in Nchelenge were co-infected. The WHO recommends treating chlamydia during pregnancy with a one-time 1 g dose of azithromycin. The same dose, however, may also hasten the emergence of untreatable gonorrhoea among women with co-infection. Gonorrhoea in pregnancy, per WHO guidelines, should be treated with either ceftriaxone 250 mg by intramuscular injection plus azithromycin 1 g orally, or cefixime 400 mg orally plus azithromycin 1 g orally. If differential diagnoses cannot be established, there may be reason to provide a curative dose for gonorrhoea which would clear co-infection and reduce opportunity for gonococcus to be exposed to azithromycin monotherapy. Screening and treatment of infected partners needs to be provided with such an approach. There is a convenient dual-cassette POC test available that can detect chlamydia and gonorrhoea with one biological sample, but cost is significant barrier to routine use.

Trichomoniasis and bacterial vaginosis

Universal screening and treatment for trichomoniasis and bacterial vaginosis would be an important improvement over syndromic management, particularly given how prevalent both are in this setting. Pregnant women diagnosed with either trichomoniasis or bacterial vaginosis could be given a single 2-g dose of metronidazole as recommended by the WHO. Another option might be simply to provide metronidazole to all women at ANC booking. These two approaches need to be evaluated for their protective effect against adverse pregnancy outcomes and the cost per adverse outcome averted. Part of the comparison should include partner screening for trichomoniasis and appropriate case management.

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^112aFqqT]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Special Considerations

Pregnancy

Clinical experience and published studies indicate that azithromycin is safe and effective during pregnancy. Doxycycline is contraindicated during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy because of risk for tooth discoloration. Human data reveal that levofloxacin presents a low risk to the fetus during pregnancy but has potential for toxicity during breastfeeding; however, data from animal studies increase concerns regarding cartilage damage to neonates.

Test of cure (i.e. repeat testing after completion of therapy) to document chlamydial eradication, preferably by NAAT, at approximately 4 weeks after therapy completion during pregnancy is recommended because severe sequelae can occur among mothers and neonates if the infection persists. In addition, all pregnant women who have chlamydial infection diagnosed should be retested 3 months after treatment. Detection of C. trachomatis infection during the third semester is not uncommon among adolescent and young adult women, including those without C. trachomatis detected at the time of initial prenatal screening. Women aged < 25 years and those at increased risk for chlamydia (i.e. those who have a new sex partner, more than one sex partner, a sex partner with concurrent partners, or a sex partner who has an STI) should be screened at the first prenatal visit and rescreened during the third trimester to prevent maternal postnatal complications and chlamydial infection in the infant.

Recommended Regimen for Chlamydial Infection During Pregnancy
Azithromycin 1 g orally in a single dose
Alternative Regimen
Amoxicillin 500 mg orally 3 times/day for 7 days

Because of concerns regarding chlamydia persistence after exposure to penicillin-class antibiotics that has been demonstrated in animal and in vitro studies, amoxicillin is listed as an alternative therapy for C. trachomatis for pregnant women. Erythromycin is no longer recommended because of the frequency of gastrointestinal side effects that can result in therapy nonadherence. In addition, systematic reviews and meta-analyses have noted an association with macrolide antimicrobials, especially erythromycin, during pregnancy and adverse child outcomes, indicating cautious use in pregnancy.

HIV Infection

Persons who have chlamydia and HIV infection should receive the same treatment regimen as those who do not have HIV.

### Feasibility of Chlamydia trachomatis screening and treatment in pregnant women in lima, Peru: a prospective study in two large urban hospitals [^117R5UWe]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2015). Low credibility.

Objectives

Chlamydia trachomatis, which is asymptomatic in most women, causes significant adverse effects for pregnant women and neonates. No programmes conduct antenatal screening in Latin America. We determined chlamydia prevalence, feasibility and acceptability of chlamydia screening, and adherence to treatment in pregnant women in two urban public hospitals in Lima, Peru.

Methods

We offered chlamydia screening using self-collected vaginal swabs to pregnant women ≥ 16 years of age during their first antenatal visit. Chlamydia-infected women were contacted within 14 days and asked to bring partners for counselling and directly observed therapy with oral azithromycin. Unaccompanied women received counselling, directly observed therapy, and azithromycin to take to partners. Test of cure was performed ≥ 3 weeks after treatment.

Results

We approached 640 women for the study and enrolled 600 (93.8%). Median age was 27.3 years (range 16–47), median lifetime partners 2.3 (range 1–50), and median gestational age 26.1 weeks (range 4–41). Chlamydia prevalence was 10% (95% CI 7.7% to 12.7%). Of 60 infected patients, 59 (98%) were treated with one dose of azithromycin. Fifty-two of 59 (88%) returned for test of cure, all of whom were treated successfully, with 46 (86%) achieving negative test of cure with one dose of azithromycin, and 6 (12%) after retreatment with a second dose.

Conclusions

C. trachomatis screening and treatment in pregnancy was feasible and highly acceptable in two urban hospitals in Peru. Chlamydia prevalence was high. Clinical trials to evaluate efficacy and cost-effectiveness of chlamydia screening, and treatment of pregnant women to prevent adverse pregnancy outcomes in low-resource settings, are warranted.

### Society of Family Planning clinical recommendation: prevention of infection after abortion and pregnancy loss [^111LNrxx]. Contraception (2025). High credibility.

Society of Family Planning clinical recommendation — sexually transmitted infection screening and timing — states: We recommend clinicians (1) test and treat patients empirically for gonorrhea and chlamydia when (a) they are at increased risk of infection, (b) present with a known diagnosis of gonorrhea or chlamydia but have not received treatment, or (3) provide routine annual screening for gonorrhea and chlamydia for patients under 25 years and others at increased risk based on the US Preventive Services Task Force recommendations; clinicians should not delay abortion while awaiting diagnosis or treatment (GRADE 1C). We recommend against screening for bacterial vaginosis before abortion (GRADE 1C).

### High rates of persistent and recurrent Chlamydia in pregnant women after treatment with azithromycin [^112jkwxD]. American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology MFM (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Principal findings

In this retrospective cohort study of 810 pregnant women with urogenital chlamydia treated with first-line azithromycin, nearly 1 in 4 pregnancies with repeat chlamydia testing had persistence or recurrence. STI coinfection with gonorrhea or syphilis during pregnancy was the only significant risk factor for persistent or recurrent chlamydia in a model that adjusted for age, race, and insurance status.

Results

Our analysis adds to the scant information about the outcomes of chlamydia treatment in pregnancy in the midst of an STI epidemic in the United States. Reported rates of chlamydia in women have risen slowly since 2000 with a steeper increase since 2013. The population of young pregnant women included in this study are at increased risk of chlamydia (Alabama has the 15th highest state case rate at 583 cases of 100,000 persons), yet rates are trending upward in all regions in the United States. Rates of chlamydia persistence or recurrence in pregnancy in this study are elevated compared with older published data: 6% repeat positivity in pregnancy was documented in an analysis of laboratory data in the United States collected in 2005–2008, and persistence was 17% among 211 pregnant adolescents with follow-up testing 2 weeks after treatment. Rates of recurrent infection in nonpregnant women average 14%, and predictors of recurrence include age of < 20 years and black race. The current study shows that gonorrhea and syphilis coinfection in pregnancy is independently associated with persistent or recurrent chlamydia. This is consistent with studies in nonpregnant women. Sexual networks, regional STI prevalence, biologic susceptibility, and pregnancy status likely affect chlamydia acquisition risk in women but it is challenging to determine the attributable risk for each of these exposures.

The rationale for universal chlamydia screening in pregnant women is to prevent adverse birth outcomes associated with infection. A recent meta-analysis examined the association between untreated chlamydia in pregnancy and preterm delivery and documented a pooled OR of 2.3 (95% CI, 1.6–3.2). Adverse birth outcomes detected in the current study are consistent with these data given the somewhat higher rates of preterm delivery in pregnancies with persistence despite treatment.

### High rates of persistent and recurrent Chlamydia in pregnant women after treatment with azithromycin [^117Uta99]. American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology MFM (2020). Medium credibility.

BACKGROUND:

Chlamydia trachomatis is a common bacterial sexually transmitted infection that can persist or recur after antibiotic treatment. Universal screening for chlamydia in pregnancy is recommended to prevent adverse birth outcomes. Single-dose oral azithromycin has been the first-line therapy for chlamydia in pregnancy since 2006.

OBJECTIVE:

In the setting of limited data and rising sexually transmitted infection rates in the United States, our goal was to document rates and risk factors for persistent or recurrent chlamydia after azithromycin treatment in pregnancy.

STUDY DESIGN:

This retrospective cohort study included pregnancies with urogenital chlamydia and follow-up testing in women who delivered at an Alabama facility between November 2012 and December 2017. Pregnancies with prescribed azithromycin therapy and repeat chlamydia testing ≥ 21 days later were included. Chlamydia trachomatis nucleic acid amplification testing was performed on genital swab or urine samples. Descriptive characteristics and birth outcomes were compared for categories stratified by repeat test results: persistence (+ +), recurrence (+ − +), or clearance (+ −). Logistic regression models were used to identify demographic and clinical risk factors for persistent or recurrent chlamydia in pregnancy.

RESULTS:

Among 810 women with 840 pregnancies with repeat chlamydia testing after azithromycin treatment, 114 (14%) had persistence and an additional 72 (9%) had recurrence later in pregnancy. The median time to repeat testing was 30 days (interquartile range, 24–49 days). Concomitant gonorrhea or syphilis in pregnancy was independently associated with persistent or recurrent chlamydia (adjusted odds ratio, 1.6; 95% confidence interval, 1.1–2.4).

CONCLUSION:

Persistent or recurrent chlamydia after azithromycin treatment was detected in nearly 1 in 4 pregnancies with repeat testing in our urban center, highlighting the importance of performing a test of cure and ensuring partner therapy to reduce recurrent chlamydia risk.

### Prevention and treatment of sexually transmitted diseases: an update [^1175cE4i]. American Family Physician (2007). Low credibility.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently published revised guidelines for the prevention and treatment of sexually transmitted diseases. One new treatment strategy is the use of azithromycin as a primary, rather than alternative, medication for pregnant women with Chlamydia trachomatis infection. Quinolone-resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae infection continues to increase in the United States; therefore, quinolones are no longer recommended for treatment of this infection. Expedited partner therapy gives physicians another option when addressing the need to treat partners of persons diagnosed with N. gonorrhoeae or C. trachomatis infection. Tinidazole is now available in the United States and can be used to manage trichomoniasis, including trichomoniasis resistant to metronidazole. Shorter courses of antiviral medication can be used for episodic therapy of recurrent genital herpes. Because of increasing resistance, close follow-up is required if azithromycin is used as an alternative treatment in the management of primary or secondary syphilis. Unexpected increases in the rates of lymphogranuloma venereum have occurred in The Netherlands, and physicians should remain vigilant for symptoms of this disease in the United States.

### Screening for Chlamydia and gonorrhea: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^1157rG5a]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

Recommendations of others — Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP), and American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) guidance is as follows: The CDC recommends annual chlamydia and gonorrhea testing in all sexually active women younger than 25 years and in older women at increased risk of infection, and it also recommends screening for both infections in pregnant women younger than 25 years and in older pregnant women at increased risk for infection during their first prenatal visit and again during their third trimester if risk remains high. The CDC recommends that clinicians consider screening for chlamydia in sexually active young men in high-prevalence areas and populations, recommends annual screening for chlamydia and gonorrhea at appropriate anatomical sites of exposure in men who have sex with men with more frequent screening if risk behaviors persist or if they or their sex partners have multiple partners, and recommends screening transgender individuals on the basis of their sexual practices and anatomy. Because of high rates of STIs in persons entering correctional facilities, the CDC recommends chlamydia and gonorrhea screening at intake in correctional facilities in women 35 years or younger and in men younger than 30 years, and because of the high likelihood of reinfection it recommends retesting all patients diagnosed with chlamydial or gonococcal infections 3 months after treatment, regardless of whether they believe their partners have been treated. ACOG endorses the CDC's recommendations that clinicians annually screen all sexually active women younger than 25 years and in older women at risk for chlamydia and gonorrhea, recommends that all pregnant women be tested for chlamydia early in pregnancy with a repeat test in the third trimester for women with risk factors, and recommends testing for gonorrhea in pregnant women 25 years or younger or for women living in an area where gonorrhea is common. The AAFP follows the 2014 USPSTF chlamydia and gonorrhea screening recommendations, and AAP recommendations align with the CDC guidelines.

### High rates of persistent and recurrent Chlamydia in pregnant women after treatment with azithromycin [^1121Wz2E]. American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology MFM (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Chlamydia trachomatis is an intracellular bacterium that causes cervical infection. More than 1.1 million cases of chlamydia in women were reported to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in 2018. Women between the ages of 15 and 24 years and women who reside in the southeastern United States, where the case rate is 744 cases per 100,000 persons, are disproportionally affected by chlamydia. - Untreated chlamydia in pregnancy has been associated with preterm delivery and low birthweight (LBW) infants. - Infection in women is usually asymptomatic, and timely screening and treatment in pregnancy can prevent adverse outcomes. Despite rising chlamydia rates in the US, few studies focus on chlamydia treatment outcomes after azithromycin therapy in pregnant women.

The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) has recommended universal screening for chlamydia in pregnancy since 2007.CDC recommends performing a test of cure for pregnant women with chlamydia at least 21 days after treatment and repeat testing 12 weeks later to screen for reinfection. In an observational study from a commercial laboratory database in the United States (2005–2008), 59% of pregnant women had chlamydia testing and 3.5% had a positive result. Among women with chlamydia who underwent repeated testing, 6% had repeat positivity during pregnancy but treatment data were not available. Recurrent chlamydia in nonpregnant women is well documented: a systematic review suggested a 14% recurrence rate during follow-up periods ranging from 2 months to 13 years. Younger age (< 26 years) and bacterial sexually transmitted infection (STI) coinfection have been associated with recurrent chlamydia in nonpregnant women. -

Chlamydia infection that recurs after antibiotic treatment and clearance (defined by a negative test) usually represents reinfection from a sexual partner. The mechanism for repeatedly positive chlamydia testing is more varied. It may represent recurrent infection (after undocumented clearance), false-positive polymerase chain reaction test result owing to residual DNA/RNA, or treatment failure. Unlike gonococcal infection, antimicrobial resistant chlamydial infection is rare. - Single-dose oral azithromycin (1 g) is the CDC-recommended treatment for chlamydia in pregnancy. Azithromycin has a favorable safety profile in pregnancy, and it is one of the most commonly prescribed antibiotic agents worldwide. Recent reports suggest that clinical treatment failure can occur with azithromycin treatment for rectal chlamydia and nonresponse to azithromycin for urogenital chlamydia in pregnancy has been reported.-

### Screening for chlamydial infection [^112wSFff]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Objectives

To examine data on the effectiveness of screening for chlamydial infection by a physician or other health care professional. Specifically, we examine the evidence that early treatment of chlamydial infection improves health outcomes, as well as evidence of the effectiveness of screening strategies in nonpregnant women, pregnant women, and men, and the accuracy of tests used for screening. This review updates the literature since the last recommendation of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force published in 1996.

Search Strategy

We searched the topic of chlamydia in the MEDLINE, HealthSTAR, and Cochrane Library databases from January 1994 to July 2000, supplemented by reference lists of relevant articles and from experts in the field. Articles published prior to 1994 and research abstracts were cited if particularly important to the key questions or to the interpretation of included articles.

Selection Criteria

A single reader reviewed all English abstracts. Articles were selected for full review if they were about Chlamydia trachomatis genitourinary infections in nonpregnant women, pregnant women, or men and were relevant to key questions in the analytic framework. Investigators read the full-text version of the retrieved articles and applied additional eligibility criteria. For all topics, we excluded articles if they did not provide sufficient information to determine the methods for selecting subjects and for analyzing data.

Data Collection and Analysis

We systematically reviewed three types of studies about screening in nonpregnant women that relate to three key questions: (1) studies about the effectiveness of screening programs in reducing prevalence rates of infection, (2) studies about risk factors for chlamydial infection in women, and (3) studies about chlamydial screening tests in women. Our search found too few studies on pregnant women to systematically review, although pertinent studies are described. We systematically reviewed two types of studies about screening in men: (1) studies about prevalence rates and risk factors for chlamydial infection in men and (2) studies about chlamydial screening tests in men.

Main Results

Nonpregnant women. The results of a randomized controlled trial conducted in a large health maintenance organization indicate that screening women selected by a set of risk factors reduces the incidence of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) over a 1-year period. Changes in population prevalence rates have not been well documented because few studies have employed a representative population sample. Age continues to be the best predictor of chlamydial infection in women, with most studies evaluating cut-offs at age younger than 25 years. Other risk factors may be useful predictors, but these are likely to be population specific. To determine the accuracy of screening tests for women, we retrieved and critically reviewed 34 articles on test performance. Results indicate that endocervical swab specimens and first-void urine specimens have similar performance when using DNA amplification tests and have better sensitivity than endocervical culture. Recurrent chlamydial infections in women have been associated with increased risks for PID and ectopic pregnancies. Pregnant women. The Second Task Force recommendations for screening pregnant women were based on two major studies demonstrating improved pregnancy outcomes following treatment of chlamydial infection. We identified no recent studies on this topic in our literature search. Very few studies describe risk factors for chlamydial infection in pregnant women. Nonculture testing techniques appear to perform well in pregnant women, although studies are limited. Men. No studies described the effectiveness of screening or early treatment for men in reducing transmission to women or in preventing acute infections or complications in men. Studies of prevalence rates and risk factors for chlamydial infection in men are limited. Age lower than 25 years is the strongest known risk factor cited so far. Results of urethral swab specimens compared to first-void urine specimens were similar for DNA amplification tests. DNA amplification techniques are more sensitive than culture.

Conclusions

Screening women for Chlamydia trachomatis reduces the incidence of PID, and it is associated with reductions in prevalence of infection in uncontrolled studies. No studies were found to determine whether screening asymptomatic men would reduce transmission or prevent acute infections or complications. Age is the strongest risk factor for men and women. A variety of tests can detect chlamydial infection with acceptable sensitivity and specificity, including new DNA amplification tests that use either endocervical swabs in women, urethral swabs in men, or first-void urine specimens from men and women.

Study outcomes

For study outcomes, persistence (group 1) was defined by positive C trachomatis NAAT results on follow-up testing performed in pregnancy (+ + or + + +). Recurrence (group 2) was an incident infection defined by negative NAAT results on the first follow-up test followed by a positive NAAT result (+ − +). Clearance (group 3) was defined by negative NAAT results on all follow-up testing in pregnancy (+ − or + − −). Frequent prenatal visits with multiple testing opportunities allowed us to categorize persistence or recurrence separately but many studies of repeated chlamydia infection use a combined outcome of persistent and recurrent infection outcome owing to variable follow-up periods and limited treatment data. For our association model, we used the combined outcome of persistent and recurrent infection given the sample size and for the sake of comparison with previous studies. Birth outcomes included preterm delivery (< 37 weeks' gestation), LBW (< 2500 g), and intrauterine fetal demise (IUFD) or stillbirth.

Study demographics included age, race, ethnicity, marital status, medical insurance, urban residence (Jefferson County), and year of delivery. Other variables included gestational age at the time of the initial positive test, time in days between the initial positive test and repeat testing, location of testing, and date of azithromycin prescription.HIV/STI coinfection in pregnancy was defined according to the results of gonorrhea NAAT testing on urogenital samples, syphilis serology with confirmatory testing, and HIV antibody screening with confirmatory testing. The timing of gonorrhea or syphilis coinfection during pregnancy in relation to the timing of the initial positive chlamydia test was collected.

Chlamydia diagnostic testing

All testing during the study period used the highly sensitive C trachomatis NAAT on urogenital samples. The UAB Obstetrics and Gynecology Diagnostic Laboratory tested outpatient samples using Roche Amplicor (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN) in 2011–2012, and Roche COBAS 4800 in 2013–2017. The main UAB laboratory tested samples collected in the emergency room and inpatient setting using BD Viper (BD Diagnostic Systems, Sparks, MD) in 2011–2014 and Hologic Aptima (Hologic, San Diego, CA) in 2014–2017. The sensitivity of various NAAT tests performed for C trachomatis in this study ranges from 90% to 98% with specificity of > 99% and similar performance characteristics for all sample sites (vaginal, cervical, and urine). -

### Screening for Chlamydia and gonorrhea: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^113FQsWf]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

USPSTF clinician summary — screening recommendations and applicability states: For sexually active women, including pregnant persons, screen for chlamydia if they are 24 years or younger or 25 years or older and at increased risk for infection (Grade: B), and screen for gonorrhea if they are 24 years or younger or 25 years or older and at increased risk for infection (Grade: B). For sexually active men, the evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for chlamydia and gonorrhea in men (I statement). The recommendation applies to sexually active adolescents and adults, including pregnant persons, without signs and symptoms of chlamydia or gonorrhea infection, and is consistent with the 2014 USPSTF recommendation.

USPSTF clinician implementation — screening intervals and treatment notes that in the absence of studies on screening intervals, a reasonable approach is to screen patients whose sexual history reveals new or persistent risk factors since the last negative test result, and that chlamydial and gonococcal infections respond to treatment with antibiotics; because treatment varies by patient and antibiotic resistance for gonorrhea is increasing, clinicians are encouraged to consult the most up-to-date guidance on treatment from the CDC.

### What is the excess risk of infertility in women after genital Chlamydia infection? A systematic review of the evidence [^114c74dR]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To summarise evidence on the attributable risk of infertility after chlamydial infection in women.

Methods

Twelve databases were searched, limited to peer-reviewed literature published from January 1970 to September 2007. Conference abstracts and reference lists from reviews published since 2000 and from key articles were hand-searched. Studies were selected for review if they met the following criteria: (1) the study population comprised women of child-bearing age (defined as 15–45 years) and incorporated a comparison group of women documented as "chlamydia negative"; (2) the study outcomes included either infertility or successful pregnancy; and (3) the study design was one of the following: cohort, randomised controlled trial, "before and after" study, screening trial and systematic review. Studies were excluded if they described genital infections that either did not include Chlamydia trachomatis or described genital chlamydial co-infection, in which no data were available for C trachomatis infection alone.

Results

3349 studies were identified by the search. One study satisfied the inclusion criteria, a longitudinal investigation measuring pregnancy rates in adolescent women with and without current chlamydial infection at baseline. That study reported no significant difference in subsequent pregnancy rates; however, it had serious methodological limitations, which restricted its conclusions.

Conclusions

This systematic review demonstrates the absence of valid evidence on the attributable risk of post-infective tubal factor infertility after genital chlamydial infection. The findings contribute empirical data to the growing debate surrounding previous assumptions about the natural history of chlamydial infection in women.

### Pregnancy outcome following gestational exposure to azithromycin [^117Lzfb7]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2006). Low credibility.

All of these primary infections that are treated with azithromycin are common among women of child bearing age, and coupled with the fact that at least 50 percent of pregnancies are unplanned, 8 the likelihood of azithromycin being prescribed during pregnancy is very high. Consequently, there is a need for evidence-based data related to the fetal safety of azithromycin. Our primary objective was to ascertain if there is an increased risk of major malformations (above the baseline risk of 1–3%) in women exposed to azithromycin during pregnancy. Secondary outcomes of interest included rates of spontaneous abortions, fetal distress, gestational age at birth and mean birth weight.

### Chlamydial and gonococcal infections: screening, diagnosis, and treatment [^111SgVdL]. American Family Physician (2022). Medium credibility.

Infections caused by Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae are increasing in the United States. Because most infections are asymptomatic, screening is key to preventing complications such as pelvic inflammatory disease and infertility and decreasing community and vertical neonatal transmission. All sexually active people with a cervix who are younger than 25 years and older people with a cervix who have risk factors should be screened annually for chlamydial and gonococcal infections. Sexually active men who have sex with men should be screened at least annually. Physicians should obtain a sexual history free from assumptions about sex partners or practices. Acceptable specimen types for testing include vaginal, endocervical, rectal, pharyngeal, and urethral swabs, and first-stream urine samples. Uncomplicated gonococcal infection should be treated with a single 500-mg dose of intramuscular ceftriaxone in people weighing less than 331 lb (150 kg). Preferred chlamydia treatment is a seven-day course of doxycycline, 100 mg taken by mouth twice per day. All nonpregnant people should be tested for reinfection approximately three months after treatment or at the first visit in the 12 months after treatment. Pregnant patients diagnosed with chlamydia or gonorrhea should have a test of cure four weeks after treatment.

The following constitutes key background information on Chlamydia trachomatis infection:

- Definition: C. trachomatis infection is a common bacterial STI characterized primarily by urethritis in males and endocervicitis in females.
- Pathophysiology: The obligate intracellular bacteria C. trachomatis is responsible for the disease and may be transmitted through oral, vaginal or anal sex.
- Disease course: The most common manifestations include urethritis in men and mucopurulent cervicitis, urethritis, and endometritis in women. Disease progression may lead to pelvic inflammatory disease, which in pregnancy results in premature delivery and puerperal and neonatal infections.
- Prognosis and risk of recurrence: C. trachomatis infection during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of perinatal mortality (RR 1.84, 95% CI 1.15–2.94).

### Pregnancy outcome following gestational exposure to azithromycin [^1138icyR]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Azithromycin (Zithromax ®) is an azalide antibiotic belonging to a subclass of macrolide antibiotics developed as an alternative treatment to improve the spectrum of activity and to eliminate some of the clinical disadvantages associated with other macrolides. Structural modification resulting from substitution of a nitrogen atom on the lactone ring with a methyl group, protects azithromycin from breakdown by gastric acidity and thereby increases its elimination half-life, making it possible for single dose therapy. Its unique pharmacokinetic properties offer additional clinical advantages that include a substantial reduction of gastrointestinal side effects and increased patient compliance due to more convenient dosing regimens. Its main indications for use include treatment of mild to moderate infections of the upper and lower respiratory tract, as well as skin infections. Azithromycin is also highly effective against urogenital infections such as Chlamydia and gonorrhea when administered as a single one-gram dose. As well, its anti-inflammatory role in cystic fibrosis was also established. Recently, a large study examining treatment of trachomas(almost 1000 people) was published, that documented that the prevalence and intensity of infection fell dramatically and remained low for two years after one treatment.

Animal reproductive studies found no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus following azithromycin exposure. Only limited information on the effects of azithromycin use during human pregnancy is available. One study suggested that azalide macrolide was associated with limited transplacental transfer as only 2.6% of the drug that reached the maternal arterial side crossed the placenta.

Although several studies are available on the gestational use of azithromycin, the focus of these studies was to establish the efficacy rather than to examine its safety in pregnancy. Effectiveness of the drug for numerous indications were well established in these reports, however no information was provided regarding the gestational age at time of exposure or pregnancy outcomes. There was an observational cohort study that described the outcomes of pregnancies in women who were prescribed newly marketed drugs by their general practitioners. There were 11 reported exposures to azithromycin during the first trimester, resulting in one elective abortion, one ectopic pregnancy and 10 healthy, full-term babies. Another study investigating the efficacy of azithromycin in reducing lower genital ureaplasma colonization in 32 women at risk of pre-term delivery found no adverse neonatal outcomes. Finally, two cases of women with scrub typhus treated successfully with three-day courses of azithromycin in the second trimester reported healthy pregnancy outcomes.

### High rates of persistent and recurrent Chlamydia in pregnant women after treatment with azithromycin [^115CJjU8]. American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology MFM (2020). Medium credibility.

Finally, in terms of treatment failure, azithromycin is the only CDC-recommended therapy for chlamydia in pregnancy with high levels of efficacy in published studies to date.- A recent Cochrane review that focused on chlamydia treatment in pregnancy included 6 randomized controlled trials (n = 191) and showed cure rates of 94% with azithromycin.CDC uses a threshold of 95% efficacy to determine which antibiotic agents to recommend for STI because antimicrobial testing is rarely performed. Antimicrobial resistance is unlikely to explain the elevated rates of repeat positive tests demonstrated in the current study but further study is needed.

Research implications

The importance of STI coinfection, genital tract immunity, rectal infection, genetic and microbiome factors that predispose to recurrent chlamydia, and the mechanism of prolonged chlamydia persistence in pregnancy warrant additional study. Pregnant women diagnosed as having syphilis or gonorrhea may benefit from more frequent chlamydia screening with test of cure and enhanced efforts to ensure partner therapy.

Strengths and limitations

The study's limitations include a lack of information about sexual partners, which can contribute to a potential misclassification of persistence vs recurrence. We also assumed that women were adherent to single-dose azithromycin, as prescribed. The timing of repeat testing varied and chlamydia testing and treatment at outside facilities was not captured; this could have biased our estimates in either direction. Misclassification owing to the number of tests performed during pregnancy is possible but most women were tested at least 3 times and study outcomes were similar in this subgroup. Finally, our diverse urban population in a region with high STI rates may not be representative of all pregnant women in the United States. Strengths include the cohort size, the use of sensitive diagnostic testing, and the linkage of pharmacy, clinical, and testing data to outcomes in pregnant women who access care.

### Diagnosis and management of uncomplicated Chlamydia trachomatis infections in adolescents and adults: summary of evidence reviewed for the 2015 centers for disease control and prevention sexually transmitted diseases treatment guidelines [^112bDYfo]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

In preparation for the 2015 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STD) Treatment Guidelines, the CDC convened an advisory group in 2013 to examine recent abstracts and published literature addressing the epidemiology, diagnosis, and management of STDs. This article summarizes the key questions, evidence, and recommendations for the diagnosis and management of uncomplicated Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) infection in adolescents and adults that were considered in development of the 2015 CDC STD Treatment Guidelines. The evidence reviewed primarily focused on CT infection risk factors in women, clinical significance of oropharyngeal CT detection, acceptability and performance of CT testing on self-collected specimens in men, performance of CT point-of-care tests, efficacy of recommended and investigational CT infection treatments, and timing of test of cure following CT infection treatment in pregnant women.

### Pregnancy outcome following gestational exposure to azithromycin [^114Ka2wY]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2006). Low credibility.

Discussion

To our knowledge, this is the first prospective study that evaluated the fetal safety of azithromycin use during pregnancy. We feel that it confirms, as with the macrolides, that this drug appears to be relatively safe for use during pregnancy.

Single-dose azithromycin therapy presents a distinct advantage over multiple doses of other antibiotics, and it appears to be the most cost-effective agent for many indications. This is particularly true in the case of adolescent patients and asymptomatic infections, where many patients are unlikely to comply with multi-dose therapy. The combination of increased efficacy, increased compliance, and fewer adverse effects than with other macrolide antibiotics, often makes azithromycin a preferred prescribing option for physicians. However, a lack of evidence-based data regarding the safety of the drug often forces health-care providers to face the predicament of estimating the reproductive risks The current recommendations of the Centre for Disease Control in the United States list azithromycin as a drug of choice for the non-pregnant population, but as an alternative therapy for the pregnant patient.

Sexually transmitted diseases may be acquired or become apparent during pregnancy, consequently, it is critical that screening and treatment for infections such as syphilis, gonorrhea and chlamydia be conducted to prevent both maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. Genital infections may remain undiagnosed during pregnancy, as they are often asymptomatic. Subsequently, consequences of treatment failure during pregnancy can be of greater concern as serious sequelae can result, including increased rates of pregnancy loss, low birth weight, preterm birth, neonatal mortality and congenital infections. In the case of chlamydia-infected populations, the benefits of treating the infection, potentially outweigh the possible risks associated with the drug, given that perinatal transmission of the infection can be of great concern.

The main limitation of this study is the small sample size, as it only had an 80% power to detect a 4.5-fold increase in the rate of major malformations with alpha value of 0.05. Approximately 800 cases in each group would be required to detect a two-fold increase in risk of relatively common malformations and thousands would be required to detect rare defects. However, despite the relatively small sample size, we had 2 other groups of women to make comparisons, thereby strengthening the limited power of the study.

Of note, all 15 women in our study who were prescribed azithromycin for chlamydia infections chose to initiate its use after being informed of the possible concerns if the infection was left untreated during their pregnancy. In contrast, most women taking the drug to treat respiratory infections consisted of primarily inadvertent exposures or second-line therapy.

### High rates of persistent and recurrent Chlamydia in pregnant women after treatment with azithromycin [^115b4SJR]. American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology MFM (2020). Medium credibility.

Adverse birth outcomes according to the chlamydia outcome group are presented in Figure 2. Rates of preterm delivery (14%), LBW (13%), and IUFD (2%) were higher in the persistent chlamydia group than the other groups although differences were not statistically significant (preterm delivery, P = .08; LBW and IUFD, P = .41). These rates are slightly higher than the 2019 state average for Alabama (preterm delivery, 12%; LBW, 10%). In 2018, preterm delivery rates in both Jefferson County and the state of Alabama were 12%. Cesarean delivery rates averaged 17% and were similar among the 3 groups (P = .68).

Risk factors for chlamydia persistence or recurrence in pregnancy compared with clearance (n = 840) are presented in Table 2. In unadjusted models, black race (odds ratio [OR], 1.8; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.1–3.0) and STI coinfection with gonorrhea or syphilis (OR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.2–2.7) during pregnancy were associated with persistence or recurrence. In an adjusted model incorporating age, race, marital status, and insurance, only STI coinfection was associated (adjusted OR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.1–2.4; p = 0.03). A separate MV model that included only the first pregnancy per woman had similar results. The independent association between STI coinfection and persistent or recurrent chlamydia persisted in sensitivity analyses that limited the retesting window to within 60 and 180 days and to pregnancies with only 2 tests performed.

### Synopsis of the 2023 U.S. department of VA and U.S. DoD clinical practice guideline for the management of pregnancy [^1155z7UC]. Military Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Pregnancy — infectious disease screening: Screening for infectious diseases, listed below, during pregnancy per current guidance from the CDC is recommended, with appropriate follow-up treatment, prophylaxis treatment, or both depending on the history, known exposure, and symptoms of infectious disease. Conditions listed for screening include Gonorrhea, Chlamydia, Syphilis, Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Hepatitis B virus, Hepatitis C virus, Rubella, Varicella, Human papillomavirus (HPV) (if the patient has a history of an abnormal cervical screen), Herpes simplex virus (HSV), Asymptomatic bacteriuria, Tuberculosis, and Group B streptococcus (GBS). Infectious diseases during pregnancy can cause significant morbidity and mortality in both the pregnant patient and the fetus, screening for infectious diseases, counseling, and treatment can improve maternal and fetal outcomes, and Group B streptococcus infections are the leading cause of serious neonatal infections (e.g., sepsis, meningitis, pneumonia) within the first 7 days of life (early-onset infection).

Treatment

Treating persons with C. trachomatis prevents adverse reproductive health complications and continued sexual transmission. Furthermore, treating their sex partners can prevent reinfection and infection of other partners. Treating pregnant women usually prevents transmission of C. trachomatis to neonates during birth. Treatment should be provided promptly for all persons with chlamydial infection; treatment delays have been associated with complications (e.g. PID) in a limited proportion of women.

Recommended Regimen for Chlamydial Infection Among Adolescents and Adults
Doxycycline 100 mg orally 2 times/day for 7 days
Alternative Regimens
Azithromycin 1 g orally in a single dose
or
Levofloxacin 500 mg orally once daily for 7 days

A meta-analysis and a Cochrane systematic review evaluated data from randomized clinical trials of azithromycin versus doxycycline for treating urogenital chlamydial infection determined that microbiologic treatment failure among men was higher for azithromycin than for doxycycline. Observational studies have also demonstrated that doxycycline is more efficacious for rectal C. trachomatis infection for men and women than azithromycin. A randomized trial for the treatment of rectal chlamydia infection among MSM reported microbiologic cure was 100% with doxycycline and 74% with azithromycin. A published review reported that C. trachomatis was detected at the anorectal site among 33%–83% of women who had urogenital C. trachomatis infection, and its detection was not associated with report of receptive anorectal sexual activity.

### Screening for genital Chlamydia infection [^111KQp9d]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Genital infections caused by Chlamydia trachomatis are the most prevalent bacterial sexually transmitted infection worldwide. Screening of sexually active young adults to detect and treat asymptomatic infections might reduce chlamydia transmission and prevent reproductive tract morbidity, particularly pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) in women, which can cause tubal infertility and ectopic pregnancy.

Objectives

To assess the effects and safety of chlamydia screening versus standard care on chlamydia transmission and infection complications in pregnant and non-pregnant women and in men.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Sexually Transmitted Infections Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, CINAHL, DARE, PsycINFO and Web of Science electronic databases up to 14 February 2016, together with World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry (ICTRP) and ClinicalTrials.gov. We also handsearched conference proceedings, contacted trial authors and reviewed the reference lists of retrieved studies.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in adult women (non-pregnant and pregnant) and men comparing a chlamydia screening intervention with usual care and reporting on a primary outcome (C. trachomatis prevalence, PID in women, epididymitis in men or incidence of preterm delivery). We included non-randomised controlled clinical trials if there were no RCTs for a primary outcome.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion, extracted data and assessed the risk of bias. We resolved disagreements by consensus or adjudication by a third reviewer. We described results in forest plots and conducted meta-analysis where appropriate using a fixed-effect model to estimate risk ratios (RR with 95% confidence intervals, CI) in intervention vs control groups. We conducted a pre-specified sensitivity analysis of the primary outcome, PID incidence, according to the risks of selection and detection bias.

Main Results

We included six trials involving 359,078 adult women and men. One trial was at low risk of bias in all six specific domains assessed. Two trials examined the effect of multiple rounds of chlamydia screening on C. trachomatis transmission. A cluster-controlled trial in women and men in the general population in the Netherlands found no change in chlamydia test positivity after three yearly invitations (intervention 4.1% vs control 4.3%, RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.09, 1 trial, 317,304 participants at first screening invitation, low quality evidence). Uptake of the intervention was low (maximum 16%). A cluster-randomised trial in female sex workers in Peru found a reduction in chlamydia prevalence after four years (adjusted RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.98, 1 trial, 4465 participants, low quality evidence). Four RCTs examined the effect of chlamydia screening on PID in women 12 months after a single screening offer. In analysis of four trials according to the intention-to-treat principle, the risk of PID was lower in women in intervention than control groups, with little evidence of between-trial heterogeneity (RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.94, I 2 7%, 4 trials, 21,686 participants, moderate quality evidence). In a sensitivity analysis, the estimated effect of chlamydia screening in two RCTs at low risk of detection bias (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.17) was compatible with no effect and was lower than in two RCTs at high or unclear risk of detection bias (RR 0.42, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.83). The risk of epididymitis in men invited for screening, 12 months after a single screening offer, was 20% lower risk for epididymitis than in those not invited; the confidence interval was wide and compatible with no effect (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.42, 1 trial, 14,980 participants, very low quality evidence). We found no RCTs of the effects of chlamydia screening in pregnancy and no trials that measured the harms of chlamydia screening.

Authors' Conclusions

Evidence about the effects of screening on C. trachomatis transmission is of low quality because of directness and risk of bias. There is moderate quality evidence that detection and treatment of chlamydia infection can reduce the risk of PID in women at individual level. There is an absence of RCT evidence about the effects of chlamydia screening in pregnancy. Future RCTs of chlamydia screening interventions should determine the effects of chlamydia screening in pregnancy, of repeated rounds of screening on the incidence of chlamydia-associated PID and chlamydia reinfection in general and high risk populations.

### Conjunctivitis preferred practice pattern [^112TH9Ua]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Conjunctivitis — pregnancy cautions, alternative regimens, and follow-up guidance — Pregnant women should not be treated with doxycycline, quinolones, or tetracyclines, and either erythromycin or amoxicillin is recommended for treatment of chlamydia during pregnancy. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention currently recommends that patients treated for gonococcal infection also be treated routinely with a regimen effective against uncomplicated genital Chlamydia trachomatis infection. If ceftriaxone is not available, cefixime 400 mg in a single dose or doxycycline 100 mg orally, twice a day for 7 days may be used, and clinicians should consider lavage of infected eyes with saline solution once. A single oral dose of azithromycin 2 g is effective against uncomplicated gonococcal infections, but the CDC does not recommend widespread use of azithromycin because of concerns over emerging antimicrobial resistance to macrolides. The CDC recommends advising all women and men with chlamydial or gonococcal infection to be retested approximately 3 months after treatment. Sexual abuse must be considered a cause of infection in preadolescent children and diagnoses of C. trachomatis or N. gonorrhoeae in preadolescent children should be documented by standard culture. Spectinomycin is not available in the United States. An association between oral erythromycin and infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis has been reported in infants aged less than 6 weeks who were treated with this drug, and infants treated with erythromycin should be followed for signs and symptoms of infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis.

Management of Sex Partners

Management of sex partners of women treated for cervicitis should be tailored for the specific infection identified or suspected. All sex partners during the previous 60 days should be referred for evaluation, testing, and presumptive treatment if chlamydia, gonorrhea, or trichomoniasis was identified. EPT and other effective partner referral strategies are alternative approaches for treating male partners of women who have chlamydial or gonococcal infection (see Partner Services). To avoid reinfection, sex partners should abstain from sexual intercourse until they and their partners are treated.

Persistent or Recurrent Cervicitis

Women with persistent or recurrent cervicitis despite antimicrobial therapy should be reevaluated for possible reexposure or treatment failure. If relapse or reinfection with a specific infection has been excluded, BV is not present, and sex partners have been evaluated and treated, management options for persistent cervicitis are undefined. In addition, the usefulness of repeated or prolonged administration of antimicrobial therapy for persistent symptomatic cervicitis remains unknown. The etiology of persistent cervicitis, including the potential role of M. genitalium, is unclear. M. genitalium might be considered for cases of cervicitis that persist after azithromycin or doxycycline therapy in which reexposure to an infected partner or medical nonadherence is unlikely. Among women with persistent cervicitis who were previously treated with doxycycline or azithromycin, testing for M. genitalium can be considered and treatment initiated on the basis of results of diagnostic testing (see Mycoplasma genitalium). For women with persistent symptoms that are clearly attributable to cervicitis, referral to a gynecologic specialist can be considered for evaluation of noninfectious causes (e.g. cervical dysplasia or polyps).

Special Considerations

HIV Infection

Women with cervicitis and HIV infection should receive the same treatment regimen as those who do not have HIV. Cervicitis can increase cervical HIV shedding, and treatment reduces HIV shedding from the cervix and thereby might reduce HIV transmission to susceptible sex partners.

Pregnancy

Diagnosis and treatment of cervicitis for pregnant women does not differ from that for women who are not pregnant (see Diagnostic Considerations; Treatment).

Contraceptive Management

According to U.S. Medical Eligibility Criteria for Contraceptive Use, 2016, leaving an IUD in place during treatment for cervicitis is advisable. However, current recommendations specify that an IUD should not be placed if active cervicitis is diagnosed.

### Screening for Chlamydia and gonorrhea: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^112Lqvwz]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

Chlamydia and gonorrhea — biological understanding and clinical presentation: Chlamydial and gonococcal infections are often asymptomatic in women, untreated infections may progress to PID-related complications such as chronic pelvic pain, ectopic pregnancy, or infertility, and infection may also be transmitted to sex partners and newborn children; accurate screening tests and effective antibiotic treatments are available for chlamydia and gonorrhea. In men, gonococcal infections are more commonly symptomatic compared with women, and serious complications from infection are less common in men.

### High rates of persistent and recurrent Chlamydia in pregnant women after treatment with azithromycin [^115FaRjW]. American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology MFM (2020). Medium credibility.

Baseline characteristics according to the treatment outcome group are presented in Table 1. The 3 groups were similar overall. Median age was 21 years, 84% of women were black, 83% had public insurance, and 96% were urban residents of Jefferson County, AL. Most of the initial positive chlamydia testing was from samples collected in the clinic (87%) during the first trimester (53%). Repeat chlamydia testing was performed a median of 30 days after azithromycin treatment (range, 21–211 days). Most (85%) repeat testing occurred within 60 days of treatment. Pregnancies with persistent infection had later repeat testing (median, 37 days) compared with recurrent infection (28 days) or cleared infection groups (30 days; P < .01). On chart review, reasons for delayed chlamydia repeat testing included documented clearance before 21 days, missed testing opportunities in the clinic, and patient loss to follow-up. Most pregnancies (82%) had at least 3 chlamydia tests performed; those with persistence or recurrence were tested more frequently than the group with clearance (P < .001).

Of note, 19% (22 of 114) of pregnancies in group 1 had a prolonged duration of persistence (≥ 90 days), with a median of 4 chlamydia tests performed (range, 3–6 tests) and > 1 course of treatment prescribed (range, 1–6 courses). Among the 100 women with persistent positivity and ≥ 3 tests, 88 (88%) had clearance and 12 (12%) had persistent positivity without documented clearance. Coinfection with gonorrhea or syphilis during pregnancy was more common in groups with persistent or recurrent chlamydia than cleared infection (P = .02). Among 127 gonococcal infections in pregnancy, 6 (5%) were diagnosed before the initial positive chlamydia test, 99 (78%) had coinfections with chlamydia, and 22 (17%) were diagnosed afterwards. All 7 syphilis infections were diagnosed after the initial positive chlamydia test. Only 1 woman with HIV was included. She had good virologic control and had been diagnosed as having HIV before pregnancy. She was in the group with recurrent chlamydia.

### Pregnancy outcome following gestational exposure to azithromycin [^1171HuaF]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Azithromycin is an azalide antibiotic with an extensive range of indications and has become a common treatment option due to its convenient dosing regimen and therapeutic advantages. Human studies addressing gestational use of azithromycin have primarily focused on antibiotic efficacy rather than fetal safety. Our primary objective was to evaluate the possibility of teratogenic risk following gestational exposure to azithromycin.

Methods

There were 3 groups of pregnant women enrolled in our study: 1) women who took azithromycin, 2) women exposed to non-teratogenic antibiotics for similar indications, and 3) women exposed to non-teratogenic agents. They were matched for gestational age at time of call, maternal age, cigarette and alcohol consumption. Rates of major malformations and other endpoints of interest were compared among the three groups.

Results

Pregnancy outcome of 123 women in each group was ascertained. There were no statistically significant differences among the three groups in the rates of major malformations; 3.4% (exposed) versus 2.3% (disease matched) and 3.4% (non teratogen) or any other endpoints that were examined. In the azithromycin group, 88 (71.6%) women took the drug during the first trimester

Conclusion

Results suggest that gestational exposure to azithromycin is not associated with an increase in the rate of major malformations above the baseline of 1–3%. Our data adds to previous research showing that macrolide antibiotics, as a group, are generally safe in pregnancy and provides an evidence-based option for health professionals caring for populations with chlamydia.

### High incidence of asymptomatic genital tract infections in pregnancy in adolescent girls and young women: need for repeat aetiological screening [^116B7iWK]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2023). Medium credibility.

Table 2
Prevalence of genital tract infections at baseline in adolescents in comparison with other age categories

At baseline, 106 (43.4%) women with an STI were symptomatic (predominantly abnormal vaginal discharge) and received empirical treatment (ceftriaxone, azithromycin and metronidazole). The sensitivity, specificity, NPV and PPV of syndromic management in this cohort in the second trimester were 43.4%, 59.4%, 68.6% and 34%, respectively (table 3).

Table 3
Sensitivity, specificity, NPV and PPV of syndromic management of genital tract infections at baseline and third trimester of pregnancy

Of 752 pregnant women enrolled in the second trimester, 462 (61.4%) women returned for their follow-up visit in the third trimester (figure 1), comprising 106 (58.9%), 173 (59.1%) and 183 (65.1%) women in the 15–19, 20–24 and > 25 years age groups, respectively. Women who returned for a follow-up visit were comparable with women who did not return except for women who returned for a follow-up study visit had a significantly higher prevalence of T. vaginalis (18.8%) at baseline than women who did not return (9.7%) (online supplemental table).

At the repeat visit, 66 of 170 (38.8%) pregnant women who tested positive for at least one STI at baseline subsequently tested positive, comprising 11 (37.9%), 27 (40.9%) and 28 (37.3%) women in the 15–19, 20–24 and > 25 years age categories, respectively (table 4). The most recurrent or persistent infections were T. vaginalis (11.5%), C. trachomatis (12.0%) and N. gonorrhoeae (9.4%). Overall, 38.8% tested positive again at the repeat visit. Thirty-eight (57.6%) women with persistent infections at the repeat visit were asymptomatic at baseline and did not receive empirical treatment.

### Chlamydia (uncomplicated, genital) [^1129bpZq]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2008). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Genital chlamydia is the most commonly reported bacterial sexually transmitted disease (STD) in resource-rich countries. In women, infection occurs most commonly between the ages of 16 and 19 years.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of antibiotic treatment in men, non-pregnant women, and pregnant women with uncomplicated genital chlamydia infection? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to January 2007 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 24 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review, we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: amoxicillin, ampicillin, azithromycin, ciprofloxacin, clarithromycin, clindamycin, doxycycline, erythromycin, lymecycline, minocycline, ofloxacin, pivampicillin, rifampicin, roxithromycin, sparfloxacin, tetracycline, and trovafloxacin.

### High rates of persistent and recurrent Chlamydia in pregnant women after treatment with azithromycin [^1119Jqba]. American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology MFM (2020). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study design and population

This retrospective cohort study included pregnancies in women who delivered at the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) between November 1, 2012 and December 31, 2017. UAB serves as a primary care facility and a regional referral center with more than 4000 deliveries each year. Women with positive urogenital C trachomatis nucleic acid amplification (NAAT) testing, documented azithromycin prescription according to pharmacy records, and repeat chlamydia testing ≥ 21 days later were included. Data were extracted from the electronic medical record, and laboratory data were queried to identify pregnancies with chlamydia testing according to inclusion criteria. Once the cohort was identified, associated variables and birth outcomes were also queried. The standard clinical practice at UAB was to order a chlamydia test of cure ≥ 21 days after therapy with repeat chlamydia testing in the third trimester. There were no electronic reminders for repeat testing. Antibiotic treatment was recommended for sexual partners through referral to the local county health department sexually transmitted disease clinic.

### Clinical updates in sexually transmitted infections, 2024 [^1175X7x2]. Journal of Women's Health (2024). Medium credibility.

Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) continue to increase in the United States with more than 2.5 million cases of gonorrhea, chlamydia, and syphilis reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in 2022. Untreated STIs in women can lead to adverse outcomes, including pelvic inflammatory disease, infertility, chronic pelvic pain, and pregnancy complications such as ectopic pregnancy, early pregnancy loss, stillbirth, and neonatal transmission. STI-related guidelines can be complex and are frequently updated, making it challenging to stay informed on current guidance. This article provides high-yield updates to support clinicians managing STIs by highlighting changes in screening, diagnosis, and treatment. One important topic includes new guidance on syphilis screening, including a clarified description of high community rates of syphilis based on Healthy People 2030 goals, defined as a case rate of primary or secondary syphilis > 4.6 per 100,000. Reproductive aged persons living in counties above this threshold should be offered syphilis screening. Additionally, American College of Obstetricians & Gynecologists now recommends syphilis screening three times during pregnancy regardless of risk-at the first prenatal visit, during the third trimester, and at delivery. In addition, new guidance to support consideration for extragenital screening for gonorrhea and chlamydia in women at sites such as the anus and pharynx is discussed. Other topics include the most recent chlamydia, gonorrhea, trichomoniasis, and pelvic inflammatory disease treatment recommendations; screening and treatment guidance for Mycoplasma genitalium; genital herpes screening indications and current diagnostic challenges; and the diagnosis and management of mpox in women and during pregnancy.

### Society of Family Planning clinical recommendation: prevention of infection after abortion and pregnancy loss [^112mqw5h]. Contraception (2025). Medium credibility.

This Clinical Recommendation serves as a revision to the Society of Family Planning's 2010 Prevention of infection after induced abortion guidance. It examines infection risk, identifiable risk factors, and prophylactic measures for the prevention of infection associated with procedural and medication management of abortion and pregnancy loss to make evidence-based recommendations for the clinical care of patients. The following are the Society of Family Planning's recommendations: We recommend clinicians test and treat patients for gonorrhea and chlamydia at the time of abortion if there is (1) high clinical suspicion, (2) a positive diagnosis, or (3) the pregnant individual is under 25 years old and due for routine screening according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's guidelines; clinicians should not delay abortion while awaiting diagnosis or treatment (GRADE 1C). We recommend against screening for bacterial vaginosis before abortion (GRADE 1C). Since the rate of infection is low for nonprocedural abortion and the number needed to treat is high, coupled with inherent risks associated with antibiotic use, we recommend against the use of universal antibiotic prophylaxis in the setting of medication abortion, medication management of early pregnancy loss, or self-managed abortion (GRADE 1C). We recommend universal antibiotic prophylaxis for patients undergoing procedural abortion across all gestational durations (GRADE 1A). For procedural management of pregnancy loss, we recommend antibiotic prophylaxis (GRADE 1A). We recommend clinicians initiate antibiotic prophylaxis for procedural abortion and procedural management of pregnancy loss before instrumentation to maximize efficacy (GRADE 1B). Antibiotics should be given with adequate time for absorption, but data on the optimal timing for prophylaxis are lacking. In the setting of osmotic cervical dilator use, there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against routine antibiotic prophylaxis before osmotic cervical dilator placement. We recommend discontinuing antibiotic prophylaxis after the procedure is completed (GRADE 1B). We recommend a single dose of doxycycline 200 mg orally or azithromycin 500 mg orally before a procedural abortion or procedural management of pregnancy loss (GRADE 1B). Metronidazole is a second-line option as it has evidence to suggest a prophylactic effect despite being less effective than doxycycline or azithromycin against aerobic bacteria. We recommend against the use of fluoroquinolones for prophylaxis in the setting of procedural abortion or procedural management of pregnancy loss due to the increased risk of side effects and complications (GRADE 1B). There is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against vaginal preparation with a local antiseptic solution or to recommend a specific vaginal preparation regimen before procedural abortion or procedural management of pregnancy loss.

Follow-Up

Coordinated prenatal care and treatment are vital because providers should document that women are adequately treated for the syphilis stage and ensure that the clinical and antibody responses are appropriate for the patient's disease stage. If syphilis is diagnosed and treated at or before 24 weeks' gestation, serologic titers should not be repeated before 8 weeks after treatment (e.g. at 32 weeks' gestation) but should be repeated again at delivery. Titers should be repeated sooner if reinfection or treatment failure is suspected. For syphilis diagnosed and treated after 24 weeks' gestation, serologic titers should be repeated at delivery.

A majority of women will not achieve a fourfold decrease in titers before delivery, although this does not indicate treatment failure. However, a fourfold increase in titer after treatment (e.g. from 1:8 to 1:32) that is sustained for > 2 weeks is concerning for reinfection or treatment failure. Nontreponemal titers can increase immediately after treatment, presumably related to the treatment response. Therefore, unless symptoms and signs exist of primary or secondary syphilis, follow-up titer should not be repeated until approximately 8 weeks after treatment. Inadequate maternal treatment is likely if delivery occurs within 30 days of therapy, clinical signs of infection are present at delivery, or the maternal antibody titer at delivery is fourfold higher than the pretreatment titer.

Special Considerations

Penicillin Allergy

No proven alternatives to penicillin are available for treatment of syphilis during pregnancy. Pregnant women who have a history of penicillin allergy should be desensitized and treated with penicillin G. Skin testing or oral graded penicillin dose challenge might be helpful in identifying women at risk for acute allergic reactions (see Management of Persons Who Have a History of Penicillin Allergy).

Tetracycline and doxycycline are to be avoided in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy. Erythromycin and azithromycin should not be used because neither reliably cures maternal infection nor treats an infected fetus. Data are insufficient to recommend ceftriaxone or other cephalosporins for treatment of maternal infection and prevention of congenital syphilis.

HIV Infection

Placental inflammation from congenital syphilis infection might increase the risk for perinatal transmission of HIV. All women with HIV infection should be evaluated for syphilis and receive a penicillin regimen appropriate for the syphilis stage. Data are insufficient to recommend any alternative regimens for pregnant women with syphilis and HIV infection (see Syphilis Among Persons with HIV).

### High rates of persistent and recurrent Chlamydia in pregnant women after treatment with azithromycin [^115NDHif]. American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology MFM (2020). Medium credibility.

Clinical implications

There are 4 explanations that are commonly cited for repeat positive chlamydia tests after treatment: (1) reinfection, (2) medication non-adherence, (3) false-positive NAAT result, and (4) treatment failure. Although we cannot distinguish among these possibilities given our retrospective design, we discuss the likelihood of each. Because the prevalence of chlamydia in pregnancy in our cohort was 10% overall and 9% of women with repeat testing had recurrent infection, we suspect that most cases of repeat positivity were caused by recurrent infection. This study and others emphasize the urgent need to improve access to expedited partner therapy (EPT) for sex partners of pregnant women with chlamydia. ACOG has recommended partner therapy for pregnant women with chlamydia when sex partners are unable or unwilling to seek medical care since 2018. - Concurrent patient-partner antibiotic therapy reduced recurrent STI in pregnancy in an observational cohort study by Mmeje et al(0% recurrence in the intervention arm vs 18% in the standard referral arm). Alabama is 1 of only 5 states in the United States where EPT is "potentially allowable" instead of "permissible". This restriction may contribute to the high rates of repeat positive testing that we observed.

Medication nonadherence may have explained some of our study findings. Nonadherence to electronically prescribed medication is reported but young women and pregnant women generally have higher rates of adherence and single-dose oral azithromycin is a simple regimen. On chart review, some women experienced financial barriers while awaiting Medicaid approval. Others had initial evidence of poor tolerance with vomiting, but subsequent azithromycin was well tolerated. Study implications remain relevant with non-adherence because follow-up testing provides critical information.

False-positive chlamydia NAAT result is a third possible explanation for a repeat positive chlamydia test. However, a recent study of 36 pregnant women with chlamydia documented a median of 8 days for clearance (range, 4–29 days) after azithromycin treatment and 94% had a negative NAAT result after 21 days. A false-positive test result is unlikely to explain many cases of repeat positive test results because repeat testing was performed 30 days after azithromycin treatment, on average.

Preventing Ophthalmia Neonatorum Caused by C. trachomatis

Neonatal ocular prophylaxis with erythromycin, the only agent available in the United States for this purpose, is ineffective against chlamydial ophthalmia neonatorum (or pneumonia). As an alternative, prevention efforts should focus on prenatal screening for C. trachomatis, including

screening pregnant women at risk for C. trachomatis infection at the first prenatal visit (e.g. women aged < 25 years and those aged ≥ 25 years who have a new sex partner, more than one sex partner, a sex partner with concurrent partners, or a sex partner who has an STI);
treating all pregnant women with C. trachomatis during pregnancy and performing a test of cure 4 weeks after treatment to verify chlamydial eradication; these women should also be retested 3 months after treatment and again in the third trimester or at time of delivery, and their partners should also be tested and treated;
retesting pregnant women during the third trimester who initially tested negative but remained at increased risk for acquiring infection (e.g. women aged < 25 years and those aged ≥ 25 years who have a new sex partner, more than one sex partner, a sex partner with concurrent partners, or a sex partner who has an STI); and
screening at delivery those pregnant women who were not screened for C. trachomatis during pregnancy if at risk or who had no prenatal care; physicians and others caring for the mother and the newborn should communicate to ensure follow-up on the results of laboratory tests performed at delivery, and if positive, prompt and age-appropriate treatment for the newborn and the mother.

Neonates born to mothers for whom prenatal chlamydia screening has been confirmed and the results are negative are not at high risk for infection.

### Management of uncomplicated Chlamydia trachomatis infections in adolescents and adults: evidence reviewed for the 2006 centers for disease control and prevention sexually transmitted diseases treatment guidelines [^114CpNXj]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

In April 2005, in preparation for the 2006 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) sexually transmitted diseases (STD) treatment guidelines, the CDC convened an advisory group to examine recent abstracts and published literature addressing management of Chlamydia trachomatis infections in adolescents and adults. Key questions were posed and answered on the basis of quality of evidence and expert opinion. Clinical trials continue to demonstrate equivalent efficacy and tolerability of azithromycin and doxycycline regimens, and both remain recommended as first-line therapy in nonpregnant individuals. More data and clinical experience are available to support the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of azithromycin in pregnant women, and, in the upcoming guidelines, azithromycin will be recommended as first-line therapy for such patients. Evidence is building that expedited partner therapy (EPT), with provision of treatment or a prescription, may be just as effective as or more effective than standard partner referral in ensuring partner treatment and preventing chlamydia recurrence in women. Although there are more studies needed and barriers to be addressed before its widespread use, EPT will be recommended as an option for partner management.

### Interventions for treating genital Chlamydia trachomatis infection in pregnancy [^113m6END]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Genital Chlamydia trachomatis (C.trachomatis) infection may lead to pregnancy complications such as miscarriage, preterm labour, low birthweight, preterm rupture of membranes, increased perinatal mortality, postpartum endometritis, chlamydial conjunctivitis and C.trachomatis pneumonia. This review supersedes a previous review on this topic.

Objectives

To establish the most efficacious and best-tolerated therapy for treatment of genital chlamydial infection in preventing maternal infection and adverse neonatal outcomes.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register, ClinicalTrials.gov, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (26 June 2017) and reference lists of retrieved studies.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) as well as studies published in abstract form assessing interventions for treating genital C.trachomatis infection in pregnancy. Cluster-RCTs were also eligible for inclusion but none were identified. Quasi-randomised trials and trials using cross-over design are not eligible for inclusion in this review.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion, assessed trial quality and extracted the data using the agreed form. Data were checked for accuracy. Evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

We included 15 trials (involving 1754 women) although our meta-analyses were based on fewer numbers of studies/women. All of the included studies were undertaken in North America from 1982 to 2001. Two studies were low risk of bias in all domains, all other studies had varying risk of bias. Four other studies were excluded and one study is ongoing. Eight comparisons were included in this review; three compared antibiotic (erythromycin, clindamycin, amoxicillin) versus placebo; five compared an antibiotic versus another antibiotic (erythromycin, clindamycin, amoxicillin, azithromycin). No study reported different antibiotic regimens. Microbiological cure (primary outcome) Antibiotics versus placebo: Erythromycin (average risk ratio (RR) 2.64, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.60 to 4.38; two trials, 495 women; I² = 68%; moderate-certainty evidence), and clindamycin (RR 4.08, 95% CI 2.35 to 7.08; one trial, 85 women; low-certainty evidence) were associated with improved microbiological cure compared to a placebo control. In one very small trial comparing amoxicillin and placebo, the results were unclear, but the evidence was graded very low (RR 2.00, 95% CI 0.59 to 6.79; 15 women). One antibiotic versus another antibiotic: Amoxicillin made little or no difference in microbiological cure in comparison to erythromycin (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.01; four trials, 466 women; high-certainty evidence), probably no difference compared to clindamycin (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.04; one trial, 101 women; moderate-quality evidence), and evidence is very low certainty when compared to azithromycin so the effect is not certain (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.12; two trials, 144 women; very low-certainty evidence). Azithromycin versus erythromycin (average RR 1.11, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.23; six trials, 374 women; I² = 53%; moderate-certainty evidence) probably have similar efficacy though results appear to favour azithromycin. Clindamycin versus erythromycin (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.15; two trials, 173 women; low-certainty evidence) may have similar numbers of women with a microbiological cure between groups. Evidence was downgraded for design limitations, inconsistency, and imprecision in effect estimates. Side effects of the treatment (maternal) (secondary outcome) Antibiotics versus placebo: side effects including nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain, were reported in two studies (495 women) but there was no clear evidence whether erythromycin was associated with more side effects than placebo and a high level of heterogeneity (I 2 = 78%) was observed (average RR 2.93, 95% CI 0.36 to 23.76). There was no clear difference in the number of women experiencing side effects when clindamycin was compared to placebo in one small study (5/41 versus 1/44) (RR 6.35, 95% CI 0.38 to 107.45, 62 women). The side effects reported were mostly gastrointestinal and also included resolving skin rashes. One antibiotic versus another antibiotic: There was no clear difference in incidence of side effects (including nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and abdominal pain) when amoxicillin was compared to azithromycin based on data from one small study (36 women) (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.24 to 1.31). However, amoxicillin was associated with fewer side effects compared to erythromycin with data from four trials (513 women) (RR 0.31, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.46; I² = 27%). Side effects included nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal cramping, rash, and allergic reaction. Both azithromycin (RR 0.24, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.34; six trials, 374 women) and clindamycin (RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.87; two trials, 183 women) were associated with a lower incidence of side effects compared to erythromycin. These side effects included nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and abdominal cramping. One small study (101 women) reported there was no clear difference in the number of women with side effects when amoxicillin was compared with clindamycin (RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.14 to 2.26; 107 women). The side effects reported included rash and gastrointestinal complaints. Other secondary outcomes Single trials reported data on repeated infections, preterm birth, preterm rupture of membranes, perinatal mortality and low birthweight and found no clear differences between treatments. Many of this review's secondary outcomes were not reported in the included studies.

Authors' Conclusions

Treatment with antibacterial agents achieves microbiological cure from C.trachomatis infection during pregnancy. There was no apparent difference between assessed agents (amoxicillin, erythromycin, clindamycin, azithromycin) in terms of efficacy (microbiological cure and repeat infection) and pregnancy complications (preterm birth, preterm rupture of membranes, low birthweight). Azithromycin and clindamycin appear to result in fewer side effects than erythromycin. All of the studies in this review were conducted in North America, which may limit the generalisability of the results. In addition, study populations may differ in low-resource settings and these results are therefore only applicable to well-resourced settings. Furthermore, the trials in this review mainly took place in the nineties and early 2000's and antibiotic resistance may have changed since then. Further well-designed studies, with appropriate sample sizes and set in a variety of settings, are required to further evaluate interventions for treating C.trachomatis infection in pregnancy and determine which agents achieve the best microbiological cure with the least side effects. Such studies could report on the outcomes listed in this review.

### Providing quality family planning services in the United States: recommendations of the U.S. Office of Population Affairs (revised 2024) [^1162avoy]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Sexually transmitted infection (STI) treatment — CDC STI Treatment Guidelines should guide treatment of all STIs. In settings where same-day treatment is available, treatment for persons with STI symptoms and their partners can be offered while awaiting results of diagnostic tests, and when possible, STI treatment should be provided on-site rather than called into a pharmacy to reduce barriers and ensure access to medication. To limit possible complications, pregnant people diagnosed with an STI should be treated immediately in accordance with CDC STI Treatment Guidelines; treatment does not need to be initiated by an obstetrician/gynecologist or other specialist. Because the presence of an STI is a biological marker of risk for acquiring other STIs, people diagnosed with an STI should be offered testing for gonorrhea, chlamydia, HIV, and syphilis unless already done at initial screening, and individuals with HIV infection should be linked to ongoing HIV care and treatment.

### Costs and health consequences of Chlamydia management strategies among pregnant women in sub-saharan Africa [^115cbEEk]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2007). Low credibility.

Objectives

Chlamydia is the most common bacterial sexually transmitted infection worldwide and a major cause of morbidity-particularly among women and neonates. We compared costs and health consequences of using point-of-care (POC) tests with current syndromic management among antenatal care attendees in sub-Saharan Africa. We also compared erythromycin with azithromycin treatment and universal with age-based chlamydia management.

Methods

A decision analytical model was developed to compare diagnostic and treatment strategies, using Botswana as a case. Model input was based upon (1) a study of pregnant women in Botswana, (2) literature reviews and (3) expert opinion. We expressed the study outcome in terms of costs (US$), cases cured, magnitude of overtreatment and successful partner treatment.

Results

Azithromycin was less costly and more effective than erythromycin. Compared with syndromic management, testing all attendees on their first visit with a 75% sensitive POC test increased the number of cases cured from 1500 to 3500 in a population of 100,000 women, at a cost of US$38 per additional case cured. This cost was lower in high-prevalence populations or if testing was restricted to teenagers. The specific POC tests provided the advantage of substantial reductions in overtreatment with antibiotics and improved partner management.

Conclusions

Using POC tests to diagnose chlamydia during antenatal care in sub-Saharan Africa entails greater health benefits than syndromic management does-and at acceptable costs-especially when restricted to younger women. Changes in diagnostic strategy and treatment regimens may improve people's health and even reduce healthcare budgets.

### Chlamydia (uncomplicated, genital) [^111es2hZ]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2015). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Genital chlamydia is the most commonly reported bacterial sexually transmitted infection in developed countries. The majority of infections affect young adults under the age of 25 years.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of antibiotic treatment for men and non-pregnant women with uncomplicated genital chlamydial infection? What are the effects of antibiotic treatment for pregnant women with uncomplicated genital chlamydial infection? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to February 2014 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 26 studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions - for men and non-pregnant women: antibiotics (single-dose) and antibiotics (multiple-dose regimens); for pregnant women: antibiotics (single-dose), erythromycin or amoxicillin (multiple-dose regimens), and clindamycin (multiple-dose regimens).

### Suboptimal adherence to repeat testing recommendations for men and women with positive Chlamydia tests in the United States, 2008–2010 [^113ZbQhd]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Chlamydia is prevalent among young persons in the United States. Infected persons have a high prevalence of infection several months later, most likely from reinfection. Retesting of all men and women with a positive test is recommended 3 months after treatment. A test-of-cure is recommended for pregnant women 3–4 weeks after treatment.

Methods

We analyzed 2008–2010 chlamydia testing data from a large US laboratory to estimate test positivity by patient demographic characteristics and diagnoses, and patterns of repeat testing of men and nonpregnant women with a positive test and tests-of-cures of pregnant women with a positive test.

Results

During the study period, 7.0% of 0.40 million tests performed in men and 4.0% of 2.92 million tests performed in women were positive. Among young women, positivity rates were highest among those aged 15–19 years, ranging from 8.5% to 10.0%. Retesting rates of persons with a positive test were suboptimal, with 22.3% of men and 38.0% of nonpregnant women retested. Although 60.1% of pregnant women with a positive test were retested, only 22.0% received a test-of-cure within the 4-week recommended time frame. Repeat tests were positive in 15.9% of men, 14.2% of nonpregnant women, and 15.4% of pregnant women.

Conclusions

Analyses of laboratory testing data provided important insights into chlamydia testing, retesting, and positivity among a diverse US population of men and women. Too few persons were retested as recommended, and interventions are needed to increase both healthcare provider and patient adherence to recommendations for retesting men and women with positive tests.

### Epidemiology of chlamydial infection: are we losing ground? [^113FEteh]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2008). Low credibility.

Screening programmes to identify and treat young women with chlamydial infection have been developed in several countries. The goals of these screening programmes are, for the individual, to reduce a woman's likelihood of experiencing important reproductive health complications, and, for the population, to reduce the incidence and prevalence of chlamydial infection in the population at risk. The primary objective of this commentary is to address whether we are losing ground in our efforts to prevent chlamydial infection and its complications.

### Chlamydia trachomatis infections: screening, diagnosis, and management [^114J5FVY]. American Family Physician (2012). Low credibility.

Chlamydia trachomatis is a gram-negative bacterium that infects the columnar epithelium of the cervix, urethra, and rectum, as well as nongenital sites such as the lungs and eyes. The bacterium is the cause of the most frequently reported sexually transmitted disease in the United States, which is responsible for more than 1 million infections annually. Most persons with this infection are asymptomatic. Untreated infection can result in serious complications such as pelvic inflammatory disease, infertility, and ectopic pregnancy in women, and epididymitis and orchitis in men. Men and women can experience chlamydia-induced reactive arthritis. Treatment of uncomplicated cases should include azithromycin or doxycycline. Screening is recommended in all women younger than 25 years, in all pregnant women, and in women who are at increased risk of infection. Screening is not currently recommended in men. In neonates and infants, the bacterium can cause conjunctivitis and pneumonia. Adults may also experience conjunctivitis caused by chlamydia. Trachoma is a recurrent ocular infection caused by chlamydia and is endemic in the developing world.

### High incidence of asymptomatic genital tract infections in pregnancy in adolescent girls and young women: need for repeat aetiological screening [^1152G9rW]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Sexually transmitted infection (STI) prevalence and incidence estimates for pregnant adolescents are under-reported. We estimated prevalence and incidence of STIs in pregnant adolescents (15–19 years) in comparison with pregnant women 20–24 and > 25 years.

Methods

Pregnant women registering at primary care clinics in Umlazi, a periurban subdistrict in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, were enrolled in an HIV incidence cohort study during February 2017-March 2018. Women were examined for abnormal vaginal discharge, received empirical treatment, tested for HIV-1 and had vaginal swabs taken at their first and a subsequent visit in the third trimester. Vaginal swabs were stored for STI testing at completion of study and tested for Trichomonas vaginalis, Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Mycoplasma genitalium using PCR.

Results

A total of 752 HIV-negative pregnant women were enrolled at a median gestational age of 17 weeks: 180 (23.9%), 291 (38.7%) and 281 (37.4%) in the 15–19, 20–24 and > 25 years age groups. Pregnant adolescents had an STI prevalence of 26.7% at baseline, not significantly lower than the 20–24 (34.7%, OR 1.4; 95% CI 1.0 to 2.1, p = 0.09) and > 25 years (33.8%, OR 1.4; 95% CI 0.9 to 2.1, p = 0.12) age groups. T. vaginalis (11.1%), C. trachomatis (7.8%) and N. gonorrhoeae (4.4%) were most prevalent in adolescents, a trend similar to the other age groups. Overall, 43.4% were symptomatic and treated at baseline. Overall, 40.7% (118 of 290) of women who tested negative for an STI at baseline tested positive at the repeat visit (incidence 19.5/100 person years). STI incidence in pregnant adolescents was 23.9/100 person years and comparable with older age groups (20.5/100 person years and 16.2/100 person years). At the repeat visit, 19.0% of all women with an STI were symptomatic and treated. Performance of syndromic management was poor at baseline (negative predictive value (NPV) 68.6%, positive predictive value (PPV) 34.0%) and at repeat visit (NPV 58.4%, PPV 34.3%).

Conclusions

Prevalence of asymptomatic curable STIs in pregnant adolescents is high and comparable with women > 20 years old. Adolescents remain at substantial risk of asymptomatic incident STIs during pregnancy.

### The implication of Chlamydia and bacterial vaginosis among low-risk pregnant women with preterm birth: a prospective multicentric cohort study [^111wUNs2]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Method

Study design and setting

A prospective cohort study enrolled participants from Al-Yarmouk Teaching Hospital and Al Ramadi Teaching Hospital for Maternity and Children between early 2022 and October 2023. During this period, low-risk pregnant women attending the antenatal clinic who agreed to participate in the study after being briefed about the study's aim and objectives. The scientific committee of Mustansiriyah University approved the study design, with IRB No. 246, dated February 2022. Participants were screened for CT infection and concurrent BV between weeks of gestation, irrespective of the presenting symptoms. They were further subdivided into two main subgroups, based on CT infection status. Positive CT cases were assigned to the study group, and those who screened negative for CT were allocated to the control group. All participants were followed until the delivery.

The patient criteria and data collection

Inclusion criteria.

Low-risk pregnant women at a confirmed gestational age of (24–28) weeks, willing to participate.
No current antibiotic use or past treatment for CT and BV in the current pregnancy.
Body mass index (BMI) of less than 30 kg/m 2.

Exclusion criteria.

High-risk pregnancy (diabetes, hypertension, multiple pregnancies, positive history of PTB, previous abortion or placenta previa, history of threatened miscarriage).
Current use of drugs (antibiotics, steroids, immunosuppressants) and/or smoking.
Cases terminated by C-section without prior labor due to unrelated obstetric emergencies were excluded to minimize potential confounding.
Missing or incomplete data.

Screening test and therapy regimen. All participants were sent to the lab, where a cervical swab (pap smear) was taken with a spatula. The sample was sent for the detection of CT-associated DNA through a PCR investigation. Positive cases of CT were treated with 1 gram of Azithromycin as a single dose. Additionally, another sample of the vaginal scraping was sent to direct microscope examination with Gram staining for the detection of concurrent association of BV, with the presence of clue cells, a characteristic of BV. The diagnosis was further confirmed by the Whiff test. Positive cases for BV were treated with metronidazole 500 mg twice daily for 7 days and repeated in recurrent symptomatic patients following CDC recommendations.

### Screening for chlamydial infection: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^116RtDFN]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Description

Update of 2001 U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendations about screening sexually active adolescents and adults for chlamydial infection.

Methods

The USPSTF weighed the benefits (improved fertility, pregnancy outcomes, and infection transmission) and harms (anxiety, relationship problems, and unnecessary treatment of false-positive results) of chlamydial screening identified in their 2001 recommendations and the accompanying systematic review of English-language articles published between July 2000 and July 2005.

Recommendations

Screen for chlamydial infection in all sexually active nonpregnant young women age 24 years or younger and for older nonpregnant women who are at increased risk. (A recommendation) Screen for chlamydial infection in all pregnant women age 24 years or younger and in older pregnant women who are at increased risk. (B recommendation) Do not routinely screen for chlamydial infection in women age 25 years or older, regardless of whether they are pregnant, if they are not at increased risk. (C recommendation) Current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for chlamydial infection for men. (I statement).

### High rates of persistent and recurrent Chlamydia in pregnant women after treatment with azithromycin [^111owMcP]. American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology MFM (2020). Medium credibility.

Results

There were 16,138 pregnancies among 13,692 women with urogenital chlamydia NAAT testing performed at our center between November 1, 2012 and December 31, 2017. The overall testing rate for chlamydia in pregnancy at the UAB laboratory was 77% because women were referred to UAB for pregnancy complications after chlamydia testing had been performed at an outside laboratory. Among those who were tested, 9.5% of pregnancies (1526 of 16,138) had a positive result and 1101 (72%) had documented azithromycin therapy. A total of 872 (79%) had repeat chlamydia testing, and 840 pregnancies (in 810 women) comprised the final study cohort with retesting at least 21 days after azithromycin treatment. Pregnancies were categorized into 3 groups according to follow-up test results: persistence (n = 114 of 840; 13.6%), recurrence (n = 72 of 840; 8.6%), and clearance (n = 654 of 840; 77.9%). Among 709 pregnancies with at least 3 chlamydia tests, the outcome categories were similar: persistence, 14.1%; recurrence, 10.2%; and clearance, 75.7%. When the testing window was limited to repeat testing at 21 to 60 days, a similar proportion (13%; 91 of 717) had persistence. Most early tests of cure performed 7 to 20 days after treatment had a negative result (30 of 32; 94%) (Figure 1). No time trends in terms of persistent or recurrent infection during the 5-year study period were noted.

### Antibiotics for treating urogenital Chlamydia trachomatis infection in men and non-pregnant women [^116rpnxv]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The genital infection caused by Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) is a common sexually transmitted infection (STI) globally. The infection is mainly asymptomatic in women, thus it can produce infertility and chronic pelvic pain. In men infection is mainly symptomatic, but can evolve to prostatitis. Clinical practice guidelines for CT urogenital infections do not give any specific recommendation about which antibiotic use as first option OBJECTIVES: To assess the efficacy and safety of antibiotic treatment for CT genital infection in men and non-pregnant women.

Search Methods

The Cochrane Sexually Transmitted Infections' (STI) Information Specialist developed the electronic searches in electronic databases (CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and LILACS), and trials registers. We searched studies published from inception to June 2018.

Selection Criteria

We included parallel, randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of men, and sexually-active, non-pregnant women with CT infection (urethritis or uterine cervicitis or asymptomatic), diagnosed by cell culture for CT, nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT) or antigen-based detection methods, who had been treated with any of the antibiotic regimens recommended by any of the updated to 2013 CT Guidelines.

Data Collection and Analysis

Four review authors screened evidence according to selection criteria and independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias. Two authors developed the 'Summary of findings' tables. We used a fixed-effect meta-analysis model for combining data where it was reasonable to assume that studies were estimating the same underlying treatment effect. We estimated the pooled risk ratio in order to establish the effects of the comparisons. Our primary outcomes were microbiological failure and adverse events, and our secondary outcomes were clinical failure, antimicrobial resistance and reinfection.

Main Results

We selected 14 studies (2715 participants: 2147 (79.08%) men and 568 (20.92%) women). The studies were conducted mainly at STD clinics. Sample sizes ranged from 71 to 606 participants; follow-up was 29.7 days on average. For the comparison: azithromycin single dose versus doxycycline once or twice daily for 7 days, in men treated for CT, the risk of microbiological failure was higher in the azithromycin group (RR 2.45, 95% CI 1.36 to 4.41; participants = 821; studies = 9; moderate-quality evidence), but regarding clinical failure, the results showed that the effect is uncertain (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.43 to 2,05; I² = 55%; participants = 525; studies = 3; low-quality evidence). Regarding adverse events (AE) in men there could be little or no difference between the antibiotics (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.02; participants = 1424; studies = 6; low-quality evidence). About women treated for CT, the effect on microbiological failure was uncertain (RR = 1.71, 95% CI 0.48 to 6.16; participants = 338; studies = 5; very low-quality evidence). There were no studies assessing clinical failure or adverse events in women, however, we found that azithromycin probably has fewer adverse events in both genders (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.71 to 0.98; I² = 0%; participants = 2261; studies = 9; moderate-quality evidence). For the second comparison: doxycycline compared to ofloxacin, for men treated for CT the effect on microbiological failure was uncertain (RR 8.53, 95% CI 0.43 to 167.38, I² not applicable; participants = 80; studies = 2; very low-quality evidence), as also it was on clinical failure (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.28 to 2.62; participants = 36; studies = 1; very low-quality evidence). The effect of in women on clinical failure was uncertain (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.39 to 2.25; I² = 39%; participants = 127; studies = 2; very low-quality evidence). Regarding adverse events, the effect in both men and women was uncertain (RR 1.02 95% CI 0.66 to 1.55; participants = 339 studies = 3; very low-quality evidence). The effect on microbiological failure in women and in men and women together, the effect on microbiological failure was not estimable. The most frequently AE reported were not serious and of gastrointestinal origin. No studies assessed antimicrobial resistance or reinfection in either comparison.

Authors' Conclusions

In men, regimens with azithromycin are probably less effective than doxycycline for microbiological failure, however, there might be little or no difference for clinical failure. For women, we are uncertain whether azithromycin compared to doxycycline increases the risk of microbiological failure. Azithromycin probably slightly reduces adverse events compared to doxycycline in men and women together but may have little difference in men alone. We are uncertain whether doxycycline compared to ofloxacin reduces microbiological failure in men or women alone, or men and women together, nor if it reduces clinical failure or adverse events in men or women. Based on the fact that women suffer mainly asymptomatic infections, and in order to test the effectiveness and safety of the current recommendations (azithromycin, doxycycline and ofloxacin), for CT infection, especially in low and middle income countries, future RCTs should be designed and conducted to include a large enough sample size of women, and with low risk of bias. It is also important that future RCTs include adherence, CT resistance to antibiotic regimens, and risk of reinfection as outcomes to be measured. In addition, it is important to conduct a network meta-analysis in order to evaluate all those studies that included in one arm only the current antibiotic treatments for CT infection that are recommended by the updated clinical practice guidelines.

Supporting evidence — scope and accuracy findings state that the USPSTF commissioned a systematic review that evaluated the benefits and harms of screening in all sexually active adolescents and adults, including pregnant persons; key differences from the prior review were combining all populations into a single analytic framework, evaluating the accuracy of risk stratification and screening strategies for identifying persons at increased risk, and focusing diagnostic accuracy on anatomical site-specific testing; because treatments were previously determined effective and well established, the review did not include a review of treatments. The USPSTF found convincing evidence that available screening tests can accurately diagnose chlamydial and gonococcal infections; convincing evidence that clinicians could identify sexually active women at increased risk; and inadequate evidence that clinicians could identify sexually active men at increased risk. In asymptomatic individuals, 3 studies with 76 136 participants using a risk score reported an area under the curve of 0.64 to 0.73, and one study showed that age (younger than 22 years) alone had accuracy similar to that for the use of more extensive risk criteria.

Treatment

Because test results for chlamydia often are unavailable at the time initial treatment decisions are being made, treatment for C. trachomatis pneumonia frequently is based on clinical and radiologic findings, age of the infant (i.e. 1–3 months), and risk for chlamydia in the mother (i.e. aged < 25 years, history of chlamydial infection, multiple sex partners, a sex partner with a concurrent partner, or a sex partner with a history of an STI). In the absence of laboratory results in a situation with a high degree of suspicion of chlamydial infection and the mother is unlikely to return with the infant for follow-up, exposed infants can be presumptively treated with the shorter-course regimen of azithromycin 20 mg/kg body weight/day orally, 1 dose daily for 3 days.

Recommended Regimen for Chlamydial Pneumonia Among Infants
Erythromycin base or ethyl succinate 50 mg/kg body weight/day orally divided into 4 doses daily for 14 days
Alternative Regimen
Azithromycin suspension 20 mg/kg body weight/day orally, 1 dose daily for 3 days

Follow-Up

Because erythromycin effectiveness in treating pneumonia caused by C. trachomatis is approximately 80%, a second course of therapy might be required. Data regarding effectiveness of azithromycin in treating chlamydial pneumonia are limited. Follow-up of infants is recommended to determine whether the pneumonia has resolved, although certain infants with chlamydial pneumonia continue to have abnormal pulmonary function tests later during childhood.

Management of Mothers and Their Sex Partners

Mothers of infants who have chlamydial pneumonia and the sex partners of these women should be evaluated, tested, and presumptively treated for chlamydia (see Chlamydial Infection Among Adolescents and Adults).

### Effectiveness of Chlamydia trachomatis expedited partner therapy in pregnancy [^1151U5MR]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Expedited partner therapy for Chlamydia trachomatis has had mixed efficacy in different populations, but limited data exist on the efficacy of the therapy in a pregnant population.

Objective

This study aimed to evaluate the real-world effectiveness of establishing a prenatal expedited partner therapy program in eradicating chlamydia before delivery and to examine the maternal and neonatal outcomes between women who received expedited partner therapy for chlamydia and women who received standard partner referral testing and treatment during pregnancy.

Study Design

An expedited partner therapy program was implemented on August 21, 2019, at a public hospital in a county with high chlamydia prevalence. Pregnant women were provided with single-dose packets of azithromycin to treat partners following a diagnosis of chlamydia infection. We prospectively observed pregnant women treated in the expedited partner therapy program who delivered at our institution in the same year and compared the outcomes with a historic cohort from the previous year that had traditional partner referral testing and treatment. We excluded women with concurrent gonorrhea, HIV, syphilis, or current intimate partner violence. The primary outcome was chlamydia reinfection or no-cure rates at repeat testing in 4 to 6 weeks following treatment or at the 36-week prenatal care screening. Secondary outcomes included obstetrical, maternal, and neonatal outcomes, including premature rupture of membranes, chorioamnionitis, endometritis, neonatal intensive care unit admission, neonatal sepsis, pneumonia, and conjunctivitis.

Results

The rate of chlamydia infection was 3.6% over a 2-year period in our delivered population. In the year following the implementation of the expedited partner therapy, compared with 419 women (mean ± standard deviation, 23.4 ± 5.5 years) who were diagnosed with chlamydia infection in the previous year, 471 women (mean ± standard deviation age, 23.8 ± 5.3 years) who delivered at our institution were diagnosed with chlamydia infection. There was no difference in race, parity, prenatal care attendance, or concomitant sexually transmitted infections. Compared with the pre-expedited partner therapy group, the rate of reinfection in the post-expedited partner therapy group was not statistically different (60/471 [13%] vs 61/419 [15%]; odds ratio, 0.86 [95% confidence interval 0.58–1.26]). In a per-protocol analysis, 72 women (17%) in the pre-expedited partner therapy group and 389 women (83%) in post-expedited partner therapy group received expedited partner therapy; reinfection was not statistically different between groups (P = .47). There was no difference in secondary outcomes, although a trend toward improved rates of endometritis was noted in the post-expedited partner therapy group (odds ratio, 0.13; 95% confidence interval, 0.02–1.02).

Conclusion

The implementation of a prenatal expedited partner therapy program did not affect the rate of chlamydia reinfection before delivery. Treatment of chlamydia in an inner-city population has multiple factors that lead to successful treatment. Future efforts to reduce sexually transmitted infection and chlamydia reinfection rates in an at-risk population should include exploring patient education and safe sex practices beyond expedited partner therapy alone during pregnancy.

### Society of Family Planning clinical recommendation: prevention of infection after abortion and pregnancy loss [^114iVLeP]. Contraception (2025). High credibility.

Chlamydia and gonorrhea — prevalence and infection risk around abortion and early pregnancy loss are quantified, with a hospital-based abortion clinic reporting 9.6% chlamydia and 1.9% gonorrhea positivity and an emergency department EPL cohort reporting 10.5% chlamydia and 2.6% gonorrhea; among patients undergoing first-trimester procedural abortion without prophylactic antibiotics, chlamydia increased salpingitis risk by 30-fold (relative risk [RR] 30, 95% CI 11–85) and endometritis by fourfold (RR 4.1, 95% CI 2.5–6.7), and a randomized trial showed the presence of chlamydia increased the risk of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) by threefold; these studies corroborate that antibiotic prophylaxis is an insufficient treatment for patients with known cervicitis, and patients with known gonorrhea or chlamydia need adequate antibiotic treatment for their infection rather than prophylaxis alone.

Other Management Considerations

To minimize disease transmission to sex partners, persons treated for chlamydia should be instructed to abstain from sexual intercourse for 7 days after single-dose therapy or until completion of a 7-day regimen and resolution of symptoms if present. To minimize risk for reinfection, patients also should be instructed to abstain from sexual intercourse until all of their sex partners have been treated. Persons who receive a diagnosis of chlamydia should be tested for HIV, gonorrhea, and syphilis. MSM who are HIV negative with a rectal chlamydia diagnosis should be offered HIV PrEP.

Follow-Up

Test of cure to detect therapeutic failure (i.e. repeat testing 4 weeks after completing therapy) is not advised for nonpregnant persons treated with the recommended or alternative regimens, unless therapeutic adherence is in question, symptoms persist, or reinfection is suspected. Moreover, using chlamydial NAATs at < 4 weeks after completion of therapy is not recommended because the continued presence of nonviable organisms can lead to false-positive results.

A high prevalence of C. trachomatis infection has been observed among women and men who were treated for chlamydial infection during the preceding months (,–). The majority of posttreatment infections do not result from treatment failure but rather from reinfection caused by failure of sex partners to receive treatment or initiation of sexual activity with a new infected partner, indicating a need for improved education and treatment of sex partners. Repeat infections confer an elevated risk for PID and other complications among women. Men and women who have been treated for chlamydia should be retested approximately 3 months after treatment, regardless of whether they believe their sex partners were treated; scheduling the follow-up visit at the time of treatment is encouraged. If retesting at 3 months is not possible, clinicians should retest whenever persons next seek medical care < 12 months after initial treatment.

### A randomized controlled trial comparing amoxicillin and azithromycin for the treatment of Chlamydia trachomatis in pregnancy [^112nGueZ]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

Our goal was to compare the efficacy of azithromycin with that of amoxicillin for the treatment of Chlamydia trachomatis infection during pregnancy.

Study Design

A randomized controlled trial of pregnant women with cervical C trachomatis infection receiving care at two inner-city, university-based prenatal clinics. Pregnant women were randomly assigned to receive either oral amoxicillin, 500 mg, three times daily for 7 days, or oral azithromycin, 1 g, in a single dose. Partners were referred for treatment. Tests of cure were scheduled 4 weeks after initiation of treatment. Statistical analysis was performed by using the Student t test and chi2 analysis.

Results

One hundred twenty-nine pregnant women were enrolled, and 110 (85%) completed the protocol. There was similar treatment efficacy between amoxicillin and azithromycin (58% vs 64%, respectively, P = .56). In the amoxicillin group 3 women (5.5%) were intolerant, compared with 6 (10.9%) in the azithromycin group (P = .31).

Conclusion

Amoxicillin and azithromycin are equally efficacious in the treatment of cervical C trachomatis during pregnancy.

### Screening and treatment for sexually transmitted infections in pregnancy [^113RUuJn]. American Family Physician (2007). Low credibility.

Many sexually transmitted infections are associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends screening all pregnant women for human immunodeficiency virus infection as early as possible. Treatment with highly active antiretroviral therapy can reduce transmission to the fetus. Chlamydia screening is recommended for all women at the onset of prenatal care, and again in the third trimester for women who are younger than 25 years or at increased risk. Azithromycin has been shown to be safe in pregnant women and is recommended as the treatment of choice for chlamydia during pregnancy. Screening for gonorrhea is recommended in early pregnancy for those who are at risk or who live in a high-prevalence area, and again in the third trimester for patients who continue to be at risk. The recommended treatment for gonorrhea is ceftriaxone 125 mg intramuscularly or cefixime 400 mg orally. Hepatitis B surface antigen and serology for syphilis should be checked at the first prenatal visit. Benzathine penicillin G remains the treatment for syphilis. Screening for genital herpes simplex virus infection is by history and examination for lesions, with diagnosis of new cases by culture or polymerase chain reaction assay from active lesions. Routine serology is not recommended for screening. The oral antivirals acyclovir and valacyclovir can be used in pregnancy. Suppressive therapy from 36 weeks' gestation reduces viral shedding at the time of delivery in patients at risk of active lesions. Screening for trichomoniasis or bacterial vaginosis is not recommended for asymptomatic women because current evidence indicates that treatment does not improve pregnancy outcomes.

Hepatitis B

All pregnant women should be routinely tested for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) at the first prenatal visit even if they have been previously vaccinated or tested. Women who are HBsAg positive should be provided with, or referred for, counseling and medical management. Women who are HBsAg negative but at risk for HBV infection should be vaccinated. Women who were not screened prenatally, those who engage in behaviors that put them at high risk for infection (e.g. having had more than one sex partner during the previous 6 months, having been evaluated or treated for an STI, having had recent or current injection drug use, or having an HBsAg-positive sex partner), and those with clinical hepatitis should be tested at the time of admission to the hospital for delivery. To avoid misinterpreting a transient positive HBsAg result during the 21 days after vaccination, HBsAg testing should be performed before vaccine administration. All laboratories that conduct HBsAg tests should test initially reactive specimens with a licensed neutralizing confirmatory test. When pregnant women are tested for HBsAg at the time of admission for delivery, shortened testing protocols can be used, and initially reactive results should prompt expedited administration of immunoprophylaxis to neonates. Pregnant women who are HBsAg positive should be reported to the local or state health department to ensure that they are entered into a case-management system and that timely and age-appropriate prophylaxis is provided to their infants. Information concerning the pregnant woman's HBsAg status should be provided to the hospital where delivery is planned and to the health care provider who will care for the newborn. In addition, household and sexual contacts of women who are HBsAg positive should be vaccinated.

Chlamydia

All pregnant women aged < 25 years as well as older women at increased risk for chlamydia (e.g. those aged ≥ 25 years who have a new sex partner, more than one sex partner, a sex partner with concurrent partners, or a sex partner who has an STI) should be routinely screened for Chlamydia trachomatis at the first prenatal visit. Pregnant women who remain at increased risk for chlamydial infection also should be retested during the third trimester to prevent maternal postnatal complications and chlamydial infection in the neonate. Pregnant women identified as having chlamydia should be treated immediately and have a test of cure to document chlamydial eradication by a nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) 4 weeks after treatment. All persons diagnosed with a chlamydial infection should be rescreened 3 months after treatment.
