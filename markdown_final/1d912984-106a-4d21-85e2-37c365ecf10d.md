vonoprazan

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about vonoprazan's pharmacology, efficacy, safety, and practical use across H. pylori eradication, erosive esophagitis, and GERD. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the drug class and mechanism of action. Then, I should verify pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, including onset, duration, and CYP interactions. Next, I will review clinical efficacy for H. pylori, followed by erosive esophagitis and GERD. After that, I need to assess safety, adverse events, and long-term considerations. Finally, I will integrate guideline positions, drug–drug interactions, and practical prescribing recommendations, and close with a balanced conclusion and caveats.

> Let me first confirm the drug class and mechanism. Vonoprazan is a potassium-competitive acid blocker (P-CAB) that reversibly inhibits the H+, K+-ATPase at the secretory surface of gastric parietal cells, and importantly, it does not require acid activation, enabling rapid onset and sustained acid suppression from the first dose, which contrasts with covalent, irreversible PPI inhibition that needs acidic conditions for activation [^114YEUfT] [^113qDMhY] [^113n4e4k].

> I need to check the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics carefully. Vonoprazan achieves peak plasma concentration within about 2 hours, has a half-life around 7–9 hours, and exhibits time-independent kinetics with steady state by Days 3–4; food has minimal effect on exposure, and its acid suppression is more rapid and potent than lansoprazole from Day 1, with higher 24-hour pH > 4 holding time ratios, which supports once-daily dosing and a faster clinical effect profile [^1119HEqw] [^1136uPaE] [^113au7Tr].

> Hold on, I should verify the metabolic pathway and CYP considerations. Unlike many PPIs that rely heavily on CYP2C19, vonoprazan is primarily metabolized by CYP3A4/5, with minor contributions from other CYPs and phase II pathways; clinically, CYP2C19 polymorphisms do not materially alter exposure, which reduces interindividual variability seen with PPIs, but strong CYP3A inhibitors or inducers can meaningfully change vonoprazan levels and should be managed proactively [^1119HEqw] [^113au7Tr] [^116Wynmo].

> Next, I will examine H. pylori eradication efficacy. In a pivotal US/European phase 3 trial, vonoprazan-based regimens were superior to lansoprazole triple therapy overall and particularly in clarithromycin-resistant strains, with vonoprazan triple therapy achieving 65.8% vs 31.9% in clarithromycin resistance and vonoprazan dual therapy achieving 69.6% vs 31.9%, supporting robustness across resistance phenotypes; meta-analyses corroborate higher eradication rates with P-CAB regimens versus PPI-based therapies, and ACG suggests PCAB-clarithromycin triple therapy over PPI-clarithromycin triple when clarithromycin is appropriate, while noting that dual therapy data are evolving and not yet a salvage recommendation in North America [^11388iZv] [^112fzYd5] [^116aDG31] [^111PurZ9].

> Wait, let me verify the dual therapy specifics and dosing. The FDA-approved dual therapy is vonoprazan 20 mg twice daily plus amoxicillin 1 g three times daily for 14 days, and while some trials explored 10-day courses and variable amoxicillin dosing, guideline framing in the US currently does not endorse dual therapy as salvage pending more data; nonetheless, randomized data show high-dose dual therapy can achieve approximately 80–90% eradication in some settings, with lower adverse events than triple therapy in some studies, though head-to-head superiority versus optimized PPI-based high-dose dual therapy remains to be definitively established [^111PurZ9] [^113GnRe8] [^1124fWih].

> I will now examine erosive esophagitis. Phase 3 trials demonstrate that vonoprazan 20 mg once daily is noninferior to lansoprazole 30 mg for 8-week healing, with numerically faster early healing at 2 and 4 weeks and consistent noninferiority across Asian populations; network meta-analyses suggest earlier heartburn resolution versus several PPI comparators, and small studies in PPI-resistant EE show meaningful healing rates, supporting a role where PPIs underperform or are not tolerated [^114TPzqG] [^111RwqoJ] [^1118j3MM] [^1112VVmj].

> Let me consider GERD without erosive disease. A randomized trial in non-erosive reflux disease showed vonoprazan 10–20 mg significantly increased heartburn-free days versus placebo within 4 weeks, with benefit apparent as early as Day 1–2, aligning with its rapid onset; however, guideline panels caution that while P-CABs are likely more potent for erosive esophagitis, overall superiority across the broad GERD spectrum versus PPIs is not established, so patient selection and shared decision-making are key [^116WfSBP] [^111SbT65] [^116mayGd].

> I should double-check safety and tolerability. Pooled analyses show overall adverse event rates around 20% with drug-related AEs near 7%, serious AEs about 1%, and discontinuations about 1%, with profiles similar to PPIs; notable signals include higher serum gastrin and pepsinogen I/II with vonoprazan, a small increase in fundic gland polyps over long-term maintenance akin to PPIs, and rare hypomagnesemia case reports; long-term extension data up to 156 weeks show acceptable safety with attention to gastric polyps and gastrin effects, and no new safety signals versus lansoprazole [^117E5e9R] [^115qdKYx] [^111yX8Hd] [^116Wynmo].

> But wait, what about infection risk and nutrient effects with profound acid suppression. The FDA labeling notes that potent acid suppression may modestly increase risks of enteric infections such as Salmonella, Campylobacter, and possibly C. difficile in hospitalized patients, and long-term hypochlorhydria raises theoretical concerns for micronutrient absorption; these risks mirror those with PPIs and warrant individualized risk–benefit discussions, especially for prolonged therapy or high-risk hosts [^112dL8PU].

> Next, I should review drug–drug interactions and practical prescribing. Strong CYP3A inhibitors like clarithromycin can increase vonoprazan exposure, and strong CYP3A inducers like rifampin can markedly decrease it; coadministration with tacrolimus has been associated with increased tacrolimus levels, and vonoprazan can increase exposure of sensitive CYP3A substrates such as midazolam, so dose adjustments and monitoring are prudent when narrow therapeutic index drugs are involved; the FDA label provides a structured interaction table that should be consulted at the bedside [^115Veum5] [^116Wynmo].

> Hold on, I should verify guideline positioning to anchor use. ACG suggests PCAB-clarithromycin triple therapy over PPI-clarithromycin triple when clarithromycin is appropriate, and highlights that vonoprazan–amoxicillin dual therapy is FDA-approved but not yet recommended as salvage in North America due to insufficient evidence; ASGE notes likely greater potency of P-CABs for erosive esophagitis but acknowledges limited long-term safety data, supporting selective use after discussing risks and benefits; AGA refractory H. pylori guidance emphasizes optimizing acid suppression and recognizes vonoprazan as a potent agent that bypasses CYP2C19 variability [^116aDG31] [^111PurZ9] [^111SbT65] [^114D5RpX].

> Let me synthesize practical recommendations. For H. pylori, consider vonoprazan triple therapy when clarithromycin susceptibility is known or strongly suspected, and consider vonoprazan dual therapy in treatment-naïve patients where adherence-friendly regimens are desirable, recognizing that dual therapy is FDA-approved but not yet endorsed as salvage; for erosive esophagitis, vonoprazan 20 mg daily is a reasonable first-line alternative to PPIs, particularly for severe grades or when rapid healing is prioritized; for GERD without erosions, vonoprazan can be considered for patients with incomplete PPI response after ensuring diagnosis and adherence, with counseling on early benefit but limited long-term comparative data [^111PurZ9] [^114TPzqG] [^116WfSBP].

> I should confirm monitoring and follow-up. Check for symptom response and adherence, review concomitant medications for CYP3A interactions, consider magnesium assessment with prolonged use, and be mindful of gastrin elevation and fundic gland polyps during long-term maintenance; if dual therapy fails, obtain susceptibility testing when feasible and tailor salvage accordingly, aligning with refractory H. pylori best practices [^114D5RpX] [^111yX8Hd] [^111JTBPw].

> In conclusion, vonoprazan meaningfully advances acid suppression therapy with rapid, potent, and sustained effect largely independent of CYP2C19, translating into higher H. pylori eradication rates in key subgroups and comparable or faster healing in erosive esophagitis, while maintaining a safety profile broadly similar to PPIs; careful patient selection, attention to drug interactions, and alignment with evolving guideline positions will optimize outcomes as real-world experience and longer-term safety data mature [^11388iZv] [^114TPzqG] [^117E5e9R] [^111SbT65].

Vonoprazan is a **potassium-competitive acid blocker** [^114YEUfT] that provides **rapid, potent, and sustained acid suppression** [^1136uPaE], with onset within 2–3 hours and duration beyond 24 hours [^113qDMhY]. It is **FDA-approved for H. pylori eradication** [^113qDMhY] (with amoxicillin ± clarithromycin) and for healing and maintenance of erosive esophagitis [^114YEUfT], with **superior efficacy in clarithromycin-resistant H. pylori** [^11388iZv] and **noninferior healing rates versus PPIs in EE** [^114TPzqG]. Vonoprazan is **well tolerated** [^111JrjZ5], with safety similar to PPIs [^117E5e9R]; common adverse effects include diarrhea, headache, and nausea [^117E5e9R], and prolonged use may increase gastrin and fundic gland polyps [^111yX8Hd]. It is metabolized mainly by CYP3A4 [^113au7Tr], so strong CYP3A inhibitors/inducers require caution [^116Wynmo]; no significant CYP2C19 interaction is seen [^115Qm2tg]. Vonoprazan is a **valuable alternative to PPIs**, especially for H. pylori eradication and PPI-refractory EE [^112fzYd5] [^115ou3Tz].

---

## Pharmacological properties

### Mechanism of action

Vonoprazan **competitively inhibits the H+/K+-ATPase** [^114YEUfT] at the potassium-binding site, providing rapid, reversible acid suppression without requiring acid activation [^114YEUfT]. This differs from PPIs, which irreversibly inactivate only active pumps and need time to reach maximal effect [^114H4KLC].

---

### Pharmacokinetics

- **Onset**: 2–3 hours after dosing [^114YEUfT].
- **Duration**: > 24 hours [^114YEUfT], supporting once-daily dosing [^113qDMhY].
- **Metabolism**: Primarily CYP3A4; minimal CYP2C19 involvement reduces interindividual variability [^1119HEqw] [^115Qm2tg].
- **Accumulation**: Minimal with repeated dosing [^1119HEqw].

---

## Clinical efficacy

### Helicobacter pylori eradication

- **FDA-approved regimens**: Dual therapy (vonoprazan 20 mg BID + amoxicillin 1 g TID) [^111PurZ9] and triple therapy (vonoprazan 20 mg BID + amoxicillin 1 g BID + clarithromycin 500 mg BID) for 14 days [^notfound].
- **Eradication rates**: Superior to PPI-based regimens, especially in clarithromycin-resistant strains (69.6% vs 31.9%) [^11388iZv].
- **Guideline support**: ACG 2024 suggests PCAB-clarithromycin triple therapy over PPI-clarithromycin triple when clarithromycin is appropriate [^116aDG31].

---

### Erosive esophagitis (EE)

Phase III trials show **noninferior 8-week healing rates versus lansoprazole** (92.4% vs 91.3%) [^114TPzqG], with faster symptom relief and higher maintenance remission rates [^1118j3MM] [^113sMFRY]. Vonoprazan is effective for **PPI-resistant EE**, achieving healing in ~60–70% of cases [^114q9k9P].

---

### Non-erosive reflux disease (NERD)

A randomized trial showed **significant heartburn reduction versus placebo** (44.8% vs 27.7% heartburn-free days) [^116WfSBP], with a rapid onset within 1–2 days.

---

## Safety and tolerability

- **Adverse events**: Similar to PPIs; common events include diarrhea, headache, and nausea [^111JrjZ5] [^117E5e9R].
- **Serious adverse events**: Rare (~1%) and comparable to PPIs [^111JrjZ5] [^117E5e9R].
- **Long-term effects**: Hypergastrinemia and fundic gland polyps may occur with prolonged use [^111yX8Hd] [^113ek7aa].

---

## Drug interactions

Strong CYP3A inhibitors (e.g. clarithromycin, ketoconazole) can **increase vonoprazan exposure** [^116Wynmo]; strong inducers (e.g. rifampin) can **decrease exposure** [^115Veum5]. No clinically meaningful CYP2C19 interactions are observed [^115Qm2tg].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

ACG 2024 suggests **PCAB-clarithromycin triple therapy** over PPI-clarithromycin triple when clarithromycin is appropriate [^116aDG31], and **ASGE 2025** notes that PCABs are more potent for EE but lack long-term safety data [^111SbT65].

---

## Limitations and future research

Long-term safety data remain limited [^111SbT65], and **head-to-head trials versus PPIs** are ongoing [^116qsrD5]. Cost-effectiveness and real-world durability also require further study [^115ou3Tz].

---

Vonoprazan is a **potent, rapid-acting acid suppressor** with strong efficacy in H. pylori eradication and EE healing, and a safety profile comparable to PPIs. It is especially useful for clarithromycin-resistant H. pylori and PPI-refractory EE, though long-term safety data are still accruing [^116mayGd].

Objectives

To describe the pharmacology, efficacy, safety, and potential role of vonoprazan with amoxicillin or amoxicillin and clarithromycin for the treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection in adults.

Data Sources

PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and ClinicalTrials.gov were searched using the terms: (vonoprazan OR voquezna) AND (" H. pylori " OR " Helicobacter pylori ") AND amoxicillin with no date limitations up to November 3, 2022.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Studies assessing the efficacy and safety of vonoprazan with amoxicillin and/or clarithromycin were included and divided into 3 groups based on different comparisons between treatment regimens used in each group.

Data Synthesis

Ten clinical trials and 17 observational studies were included. Vonoprazan-based therapy demonstrated greater acid inhibition and similar or higher efficacy than proton-pump inhibitor (PPI)-based therapy in treatment-naïve patients and with clarithromycin-resistant infections.

Relevance To Patient Care and Clinical Practice

Proton-pump inhibitor-based therapies have not reached the desired successful eradication rate of 90% for H. pylori infection. Vonoprazan-based therapies being at least as effective as PPI-based therapies offer an alternative for patients with H. pylori infection.

Conclusion

Vonoprazan-based therapies were effective and well tolerated for the treatment of H. pylori infection in adults. These regimens provide an important alternative with prolonged acid inhibition, lower potential for CYP2C19 polymorphism, and at least comparable efficacy and safety versus PPI-based therapies in patients with H. pylori infections. Thus, vonoprazan-based therapy should be considered for certain patients, for example, those with failure to PPI-based treatments.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Vonoprazan suppresses basal and stimulated gastric acid secretion at the secretory surface of the gastric parietal cell through inhibition of the H+, K+-ATPase enzyme system in a potassium-competitive manner. Because this enzyme is regarded as the acid (proton) pump within the parietal cell, vonoprazan has been characterized as a type of gastric proton-pump inhibitor, in that it blocks the final step of acid production. Vonoprazan does not require activation by acid. Vonoprazan may selectively concentrate in the parietal cells in both the resting and stimulated states. Vonoprazan binds to the active pumps in a noncovalent and reversible manner.

Antisecretory Activity

Following a single 10 mg or 20 mg dose of vonoprazan, the onset of the antisecretory effect, as measured by intragastric pH, occurs within 2 to 3 hours. The elevated intragastric pH levels compared to placebo increase with dose and are maintained for over 24 hours after dosing. The inhibitory effect of vonoprazan on acid secretion increases with repeated daily dosing and steady state is achieved by Day 4. The antisecretory effect of vonoprazan decreases following drug discontinuation although intragastric pH remained elevated compared to placebo for 24 to 48 hours following the dose on Day 7.

The effects of vonoprazan 10 mg or 20 mg once daily for 7 days on 24-hour intragastric pH in healthy subjects are shown in Table 11.

Cardiac Electrophysiology

At a single dose of 120 mg (6-times the maximum recommended dose), vonoprazan does not prolong the QT interval to any clinically relevant extent.

### Incidence and type of adverse events in patients taking vonoprazan: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111JrjZ5]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Based on the current systematic review and meta-analysis, vonoprazan often has similar safety compared to PPIs, and rarely causes serious AEs and drug discontinuation. It seems that vonoprazan has a favorable safety profile in adolescent patients and non-Asian population. Furthermore, the safety of vonoprazan may be influenced by its indications and duration. However, more high-quality studies are necessary in future to validate these findings and to explore the risk factors affecting the safety of vonoprazan.

Fig. 2
Some drugs used to modulate gastric acid secretion and their times of introduction (earliest papers listed in PubMed); some are no longer in use; the color coding corresponds to that in Fig. 1

The H + /K + -adenosine triphosphatase (the proton pump) in the apical surfaces of gastric parietal cells is the final common pathway for medicines with different mechanisms of action that alter gastric acid secretion. This observation led to the development of a range of substituted benzimidazoles that inhibit the pump, which have come to be known as proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), of which omeprazole was the first to be developed for clinical use. Recently, newer reversible PPI inhibitors, potassium-competitive acid blockers such as vonoprazan, have also become available.

Conclusions

As a novel P-CAB with different pharmacological and pharmacokinetic profiles, vonoprazan displays several benefits over PPIs, such as rapid onset of action, more potent and sustained acid suppression. From a clinical perspective, the non-inferiority of vonoprazan over conventional PPIs for the management of EE has been proven in current clinical trials to date. Therefore, vonoprazan might have the potential to become a novel option for the management of EE, especially for those with higher grade of EE and PPI-resistant EE patients. Of note, results of comparative studies comparing vonoprazan and PPIs may depend on choice of PPIs and the way of administration. Future direction should determine the efficacy of vonoprazan with a PPI of standard or higher doses administered once or twice daily for treating EE. Clinical trials of vonoprazan for the treatment of EE in the non-Asian populations are currently underway and worth expecting. Importantly, long-term safety profile of vonoprazan should be carefully considered as its indications will be further expanded. Future studies are required to explore the optimized strategies and cost-effectiveness of vonoprazan-based therapy, such as optimal dose, therapeutic duration, discontinuation, etc.

### A randomized, double-blind study to evaluate the acid-inhibitory effect of vonoprazan (20 mg and 40 mg) in patients with proton-pump inhibitor-resistant erosive esophagitis [^113x1PN2]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) are currently the standard treatment for EE, owing to their high efficacy for EE healing. Despite the effectiveness of PPIs, a significant proportion of patients with EE have been shown to be resistant to PPI treatment. Approximately 10–15% of patients do not achieve complete healing following 8 weeks of treatment with PPIs. Despite continued treatment with PPIs, 15–23% of EE patients with LA grades A and B and 24–41% of EE patients with LA grades C and D experience a relapse within 6 months. It has been suggested that insufficient acid inhibition is a major reason for the lack of EE healing observed in some patients. Of note, some PPIs are able to provide effective acid inhibition during the day, but have been found to be less effective overnight.

Vonoprazan (TAK-438) is a novel, potassium-competitive acid blocker developed by Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited. Vonoprazan has a different mechanism of action and a number of advantages compared with PPIs; it does not require an acidic environment for activation, it is acid stable, and it has been shown to rapidly exert an acid-inhibitory effect (PPIs require 3–5 days for maximal effect). Preclinical studies demonstrated that the acid inhibition achieved by vonoprazan was more potent and longer lasting than that with PPIs. Importantly, recent clinical trials have also shown vonoprazan to be noninferior to the PPI lansoprazole in terms of EE healing. Furthermore, Ashida and coworkers showed that at doses of 20 mg and 40 mg, vonoprazan was more effective than lansoprazole in some patients with severe EE (LA grades C/D). This suggests that vonoprazan may be useful for treating patients with EE who have not completely responded to standard doses of PPIs.

The objectives of this study were to evaluate the acid-inhibitory effects and the efficacy of vonoprazan at two different doses (20 mg and 40 mg) in patients with PPI-resistant EE.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Vonoprazan suppresses basal and stimulated gastric acid secretion at the secretory surface of the gastric parietal cell through inhibition of the H+, K+-ATPase enzyme system in a potassium competitive manner. Because this enzyme is regarded as the acid (proton) pump within the parietal cell, vonoprazan has been characterized as a type of gastric proton-pump inhibitor, in that it blocks the final step of acid production. Vonoprazan does not require activation by acid. Vonoprazan may selectively concentrate in the parietal cells in both the resting and stimulated states. Vonoprazan binds to the active proton pumps in a noncovalent and reversible manner.

Amoxicillin is an antibacterial drug. Clarithromycin is a macrolide antimicrobial drug [see Microbiology (12.4)].

Acid suppression enhances the replication of H. pylori bacteria and the stability and effectiveness of antimicrobials in the treatment of H. pylori infection.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Vonoprazan

Antisecretory Activity

Following a single 20 mg dose of vonoprazan, the onset of the antisecretory effect as measured by intragastric pH occurs within 2 to 3 hours. The elevated intragastric pH compared to placebo is maintained for over 24-hours after dosing. The inhibitory effect of vonoprazan on acid secretion increases with repeated daily dosing and antisecretory effect reached steady state by Day 4 with a mean (SD) 24-hour intragastric pH of 6.0 (1.5) following 20 mg once daily dose (not an approved recommended dosage). The antisecretory effect of vonoprazan decreases following drug discontinuation although intragastric pH remained elevated compared to placebo for 24 to 48 hours following the dose on Day 7.

Cardiac Electrophysiology

At a dose 6 times the maximum recommended dose, vonoprazan does not prolong the QT interval to any clinically relevant extent.

Serum Gastrin Effects

In clinical trials conducted in adult patients with erosive esophagitis, treatment with vonoprazan increased baseline serum gastrin concentrations. Mean gastrin levels remained elevated with the recommended daily dose of vonoprazan for the treatment of erosive esophagitis and the mean serum gastrin levels returned to normal within 4 weeks of discontinuation of treatment.

Increased gastrin causes enterochromaffin-like cell hyperplasia and increased serum CgA levels. The increased CgA levels may cause false positive results in diagnostic investigations for neuroendocrine tumors [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Drug Interactions (7)].

### Comparative efficacy and safety of vonoprazan versus esomeprazole-based high-dose dual therapies for first-lineeradication: a randomized controlled trial [^1142zNDv]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Given the importance of acid suppression, newer-generation acid inhibitors have been explored to improve treatment efficacy. Vonoprazan, a potassium-competitive acid blocker (P-CAB), provides stronger and more sustained acid suppression compared to traditional PPIs such as esomeprazole. Unlike PPIs, vonoprazan does not require activation in an acidic environment, has a faster onset of action, and is less affected by CYP2C19 genetic polymorphisms, leading to more consistent acid suppression across different patient populations. A recent systematic review and meta-analysis found that vonoprazan-based (VA) dual and triple therapies achieved higher eradication rates compared to PPI-based regimens, highlighting the potential advantage of potent acid suppression in optimizing treatment outcomes.

Despite promising clinical outcomes with HDDT, limited evidence exists regarding the efficacy of vonoprazan-based HDDT compared with esomeprazole-based (EA) HDDT, particularly in the first-line treatment of H. pylori infection. To our knowledge, few randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have directly compared these two regimens. This study addresses this critical gap by evaluating the efficacy, safety, and compliance of VA-HDDT versus EA-HDDT in a RCT. Accordingly, we aim to determine whether VA-HDDT offers a potential advantage as a first-line treatment option for H. pylori eradication.

### Phase III, randomised, double-blind, multicentre study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of vonoprazan compared with lansoprazole in Asian patients with erosive oesophagitis [^115JoayD]. Gut (2020). Medium credibility.

The main aim of EO treatment is to relieve symptoms, heal and maintain remission of EO, prevent complications, and improve health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are considered the standard treatment for EO and have an established efficacy and safety profile. The high potency of PPIs results from their ability to inhibit the gastric enzyme hydrogen potassium adenosine triphosphatase (H +, K + ATPase), which is responsible for gastric acid secretion by the parietal cells in the gastric mucosa. However, many early-generation PPIs have a slow, cumulative onset of action whereby several doses may be required to achieve maximum acid suppression and symptom relief.

Vonoprazan (TAK-438) belongs to a class of acid-inhibitory agents called potassium-competitive acid blockers, which, unlike PPIs such as lansoprazole, reversibly inhibit H +, K + ATPase independently of acid pH. Of note, vonoprazan is stable in the presence of acid, is water-soluble and does not require a specific pharmacological preparation such as an enteric coating, unlike PPIs, which suggests that vonoprazan may have less variation in time to onset of action than PPIs. Furthermore, in contrast to PPIs that take 3–5 days to produce their maximum acid-inhibitory effects, vonoprazan demonstrates maximum acid-inhibitory effects from the first day of administration. Vonoprazan was approved and marketed in Japan in February 2015 for the treatment of acid-related GI disorders, including EO, gastric ulcer, duodenal ulcer, peptic ulcer, reflux oesophagitis and Helicobacter pylori eradication. Recent phase II and III clinical trials in Japan have demonstrated that vonoprazan 20 mg and 40 mg is effective, well-tolerated and non-inferior to lansoprazole 30 mg with respect to EO healing at 8 weeks. In a long-term maintenance study over 52 weeks, EO recurred in fewer than 10% of patients treated with once-daily vonoprazan 10 mg or 20 mg dose.

### Incidence and type of adverse events in patients taking vonoprazan: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111fQ9JS]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acid-suppressive agents are widely used for the management of various upper gastrointestinal diseases, such as peptic ulcer disease (PUD), gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection, artificial ulcers after gastric endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD), and Zollinger–Ellison syndrome. Histamine-2 receptor antagonists, the first class of acid-suppressive agents, have limited efficacy and poor tolerance. Subsequently, in the late 1980s, proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) were introduced into our clinical practice, which strengthened the efficacy of management of gastric acid-related disorders. However, several gaps remained, such as insufficient inhibition of gastric acid, nocturnal acid breakthrough, poor compliance, slow onset of action, and drug efficacy by CYP2C19 gene polymorphisms. Vonoprazan, a new potassium-competitive acid blocker, has been approved for the management of acid-related diseases in Asia, South America, and some parts of North America. It acts on the key enzyme H + /K + -ATPase in the final step of gastric acid secretion by parietal cells, thereby hindering the exchange of H + and K + and inhibiting gastric acid secretion. Notably, vonoprazan has some advantages as compared to PPIs.– First, its activation is independent of acidic environment. Second, its onset of action is rapid, because its peak concentration can be reached quickly after 2 h of oral administration. Third, its efficacy is not affected by meals. Fourth, it can inhibit both activated and resting proton pumps in the gastric parietal cells, and the first dose can achieve the maximum acid-suppression and maintain its stability. Its plasma elimination half-life time is 5.7–8.8 h. Fifth, it is mainly metabolized by hepatic CYP3A4/5 enzyme, but not affected by CYP2C19 gene polymorphisms. Taken together, vonoprazan seems to exert more potent and prolonged acid-suppressing effects than PPIs. Current evidence has suggested that vonoprazan can be non-inferior to PPIs for the management of gastric acid-related disorders and more effective than PPIs for healing severe erosive esophagitis (EE) and eradicating H. pylori. – Several practice guidelines have also recommended vonoprazan as the first-line choice for the management of EE and H. pylori infection. However, until now, the safety of vonoprazan has not been systematically evaluated yet. Therefore, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to elucidate the incidence and type of adverse events (AEs) in patients receiving vonoprazan, and to explore the risk factors affecting the safety of vonoprazan.

12.4 Microbiology

Mechanism of Action

Amoxicillin is similar to penicillin in its bactericidal action against susceptible bacteria during the stage of active multiplication. It acts through the inhibition of cell wall biosynthesis that leads to the death of the bacteria.

Clarithromycin exerts its antibacterial activity by binding to the 50S ribosomal subunit of susceptible bacteria resulting in inhibition of protein synthesis.

Resistance

Resistance to amoxicillin is mediated primarily through enzymes called beta-lactamases that cleave the beta-lactam ring of amoxicillin, rendering it inactive.

The major routes of clarithromycin resistance are modification of the 23S rRNA in the 50S ribosomal subunit to insensitivity or drug efflux pumps. Beta-lactamase production should have no effect on clarithromycin activity.

If H. pylori is not eradicated after treatment with clarithromycin-containing combination regimens, patients may develop clarithromycin resistance in H. pylori isolates. Therefore, for patients who fail therapy, clarithromycin susceptibility testing should be done, if possible.

Antimicrobial Activity

Culture and sensitivity testing of bacteria are not routinely performed to establish the diagnosis of H. pylori infection [see Clinical Studies (14)]. The following in vitro data are available, but their clinical significance is unknown. Clarithromycin and amoxicillin are active in vitro against most isolates of H. pylori.

Effects on Gastrointestinal Microbial Ecology

Decreased gastric acidity due to any means, increases gastric counts of bacteria normally present in the gastrointestinal tract. Vonoprazan decreases gastric acidity, VOQUEZNA TRIPLE PAK or VOQUEZNA DUAL PAK may lead to a slightly increased risk of gastrointestinal infections due to pathogens such as Salmonella and Campylobacter and, in hospitalized patients, possibly also due to C. difficile.

### Randomized clinical trial: a double-blind, proof-of-concept, phase 2 study evaluating the efficacy and safety of vonoprazan 20 or 40 mg versus esomeprazole 40 mg in patients with symptomatic gastro-esophageal reflux disease and partial response to a healing dose of a proton-pump inhibitor [^116My3VZ]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) are cornerstone treatments for gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD); however, evidence suggests that most patients exhibit partial response to PPIs, suggesting the need for novel therapies that can provide an improved and sustained increase in gastric pH.

Aims

This study aimed to determine the effect of vonoprazan, a novel, orally active small-molecule potassium-competitive acid blocker, versus esomeprazole, a PPI, in preventing heartburn symptoms over a 4-week treatment period in patients with GERD and a partial response to esomeprazole treatment.

Methods

This randomized, double-blind, proof-of-concept, phase 2 clinical trial was conducted between 2016 and 2018 at 39 sites across Europe and designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of vonoprazan 20mg once daily (q.d.) and 40mg q.d. versus esomeprazole 40mg q.d. after 1:1:1 randomization of symptomatic patients with GERD and a partial response to a healing dose of esomeprazole.

Results

Overall, 256 eligible patients (female, 59.4%; mean age, 52.6years) received vonoprazan 20mg (n = 85), vonoprazan 40mg (n = 85), or esomeprazole 40mg (n = 86); mean (SD) percentages of heartburn-free 24-h periods during double-blind treatment were 36.7% (33.4%), 36.5% (35.6%), and 38.4% (34.8%), respectively, with no intergroup statistical significance. Vonoprazan exposure increased proportionally from the 20-mg to 40-mg dose (mean C max: 23.3 ng/ml to 47.1 ng/ml, respectively). Most treatment-emergent adverse events were mild, with no deaths reported.

Conclusions

No statistically significant difference in efficacy and safety was observed among treatment groups, and vonoprazan was well tolerated. The trial is registered with the National Board of Health (EudraCT: 2015–001154–14) database.

### Gastroesophageal reflux disease-related and functional heartburn: pathophysiology and treatment [^113pnQnM]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Patients who continue to experience heartburn symptoms despite adequate-dose proton pump inhibitor therapy have unmet clinical needs. In this review, we focus on the most recent findings related to the mechanism of heartburn symptom generation, and on the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease-related and functional heartburn.

Recent Findings

The immunological mechanism in the esophageal mucosa has been addressed as a potential mechanism of the onset of esophageal mucosa damage and the generation of heartburn symptoms. Peripheral or central hypersensitivity in viscera is a potentially unifying pathophysiological concept in functional heartburn. Vonoprazan, a novel and potent first-in-class potassium-competitive acid blocker, is expected to prove useful in the treatment of reflux disease.

Summary

New findings in the mechanisms of heartburn symptom generation are emerging, including the immunological mediation of esophageal mucosal damage and the development of visceral hypersensitivity in functional heartburn. In the future, we anticipate the emergence of new and specific therapeutic options based on these mechanisms, with less dependence on acid-suppressing agents.

### Vonoprazan-based therapy foreradication: experience and clinical evidence [^112rYG67]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Stable suppression of gastric acid secretion is a crucial factor in Helicobacter pylori eradication. Vonoprazan is a potassium-competitive acid blocker recently approved for use in Japan. As vonoprazan has a long duration of action and causes rapid and strong inhibition of gastric acid secretion, it has gained clinical attention for treating erosive oesophagitis, peptic ulcers, and H. pylori infection. In this review, we discuss the recent knowledge regarding the safety and efficacy of vonoprazan, focusing on its use in H. pylori eradication. The latest literature and our clinical experience have shown that vonoprazan-based therapies have satisfactory eradication rates. Additionally, vonoprazan-based therapies are associated with similar rates of adverse events as standard triple therapies with conventional proton-pump inhibitors.

### Incidence and type of adverse events in patients taking vonoprazan: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1135MDxX]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Our study has systematically reviewed the currently available evidence regarding the safety profile of vonoprazan, and found that the pooled incidences of any AEs, drug-related AEs, serious AEs, and AEs leading to drug discontinuation were 20, 7, 1, and 1%, respectively; nearly all the reported AEs were mild; and its safety was similar to that of PPIs.

Our meta-analysis has some features as compared to previous ones, as follows. First, previous meta-analyses explored the safety of vonoprazan for a certain indication. – By comparison, our meta-analysis more comprehensively evaluated the safety of vonoprazan across multiple indications, including H. pylori infection, GERD, PUD, and artificial ulcers after gastric ESD. Second, previous meta-analyses only explored AEs leading to drug discontinuation and/or any AEs. – By comparison, our meta-analyses also evaluated drug-related and serious AEs. Third, our meta-analysis, but not previous meta-analyses, – evaluated a broader spectrum of common AEs and various severity of any AEs in patients taking vonoprazan.

### A randomized, double-blind study to evaluate the acid-inhibitory effect of vonoprazan (20 mg and 40 mg) in patients with proton-pump inhibitor-resistant erosive esophagitis [^112e6KBr]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Statistical analysis

A sample size of 10 patients per group (20 in total) was planned for evaluation of the primary endpoint; the sample size for this study was based on what was considered feasible and was not statistically derived. The full analysis set and the safety analysis set were defined as all patients who were randomized and received at least one dose of vonoprazan. For the primary endpoint, the gastric and esophageal pH 4 HTRs and their changes from baseline were described using descriptive statistics and two-sided 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for each group. The point estimate of the difference in change from baseline between groups (40 mg group–20 mg group) was calculated for gastric and esophageal pH 4 HTRs with 95% CIs using an analysis of variance with treatment group as a fixed effect. The analyses of gastric and esophageal pH 4 HTRs over the 24-hour period were also repeated for the same measurements made during the two 12-hour periods. For the secondary endpoint, the point estimate and two-sided 95% CI of the healing rate were calculated. The point estimate and the two-sided 95% CI of the difference in EE healing rates between the groups were also calculated. Data analyses were performed using SAS release 9.2 (SAS Institute Inc. Cary, NC, USA).

### Brief communication: global temporal trends in the efficacy of clarithromycin-based regimens for the treatment ofinfection [^114sAhy8]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Lack of antibiotic stewardship, short treatment durations, differing usage and policies by geography, and increased, and often inappropriate, use of macrolides have all been possible contributors to increased clarithromycin resistance and decreased effectiveness of clarithromycin-based H. pylori eradication regimens. Guidance from both Europe and North America recommends against first-line empiric H. pylori treatment with clarithromycin containing PPI-based triple therapy because of antibiotic resistance and the risk of potential treatment failure. Nevertheless, a recent review of real-world evidence in North America suggests the PPI-based triple therapies are still commonly used. Recent evidence suggests that triple therapy with the potassium-competitive acid blocker vonoprazan is an effective treatment for H. pylori, offering high rates of eradication, even among patients infected with clarithromycin-resistant H. pylori.

The results of this analysis confirmed that H. pylori eradication rates for PPI-based clarithromycin-based triple therapies have continued to decline over time. Inclusion of vonoprazan-based triple therapy partially mitigated the observed decline in eradication rates. Higher eradication rates observed with vonoprazan-based triple therapyin comparison to the historical eradication rates of PPI-based triple regimens suggest that vonoprazan-based triple therapy may be less impacted by increasing clarithromycin resistance.

Vonoprazan acts on H+, K+-ATPase in parietal cells in an acid-independent manner, providing a rapid antisecretory effect that is maintained over 24 h. Moreover, vonoprazan demonstrated superior acid suppression compared to lansoprazole, with a more rapid and sustained acid-inhibitory effect. Acid suppression and maintenance of an intragastric pH between 6 and 8 is essential to optimal antibiotic action, particularly for amoxicillin, which is acid labile and requires bacterial replication for its antimicrobial effects. Thereby, the efficacy of vonoprazan-based triple therapy may be driven, at least in part, by potent acid suppression and the related effectiveness of amoxicillin, limiting the impact of clarithromycin resistance.

### The efficacy and safety of vonoprazan and tegoprazan ineradication: a comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^112qRkMZ]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

P-CABs have emerged as promising alternatives to traditional PPIs. These novel acid-suppressive agents function by competitively inhibiting the binding of potassium ions to H + /K + -ATPase in gastric cells.P-CABs have demonstrated superior and prolonged gastric acid suppression compared to PPIs, with the added advantage of being unaffected by cytochrome P450 2C19 (CYP2C19) genotype. By enhancing acid suppression and antimicrobial activity, P-CABs could potentially augment H. pylori treatment efficacy. The principal P-CABs currently employed in H. pylori eradication therapy are Vonoprazan (VPZ) and Tegoprazan (TPZ). VPZ was first introduced in Japanin 2014 for H. pylori infection treatment and has subsequently been approved in other Asian countries. Recently, it received FDA approval and is now available in North, Central, and South America.TPZ was initially launched in the Korean market in 2019 and has since been introduced in other Asian and Central/South American Countries. The Maastricht VI/Florence consensus report advocates for VPZ in combination with antibiotics as first- and second-line treatment, particularly for patients with antibiotic-resistant strains. Studies conducted by Kim et al.and Huang and Linsuggested that TPZ-based and VPZ-based therapies achieve higher eradication rates with similar adverse events profiles than traditional PPI-based quadruple therapies.

In 2023, numerous randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing VPZ/TPZ-based therapies with PPI-based therapy for H. pylori eradication have been published, yielding inconsistent and controversial results. Existing meta-analyses indicate the superior efficacy of VPZ-based eradication regimens over conventional PPI-based ones. However, these analyses are limited either by the number of trials included or by focusing only specific treatments on VPZ-based treatments, thus lacking comprehensiveness. To date, no meta-analyses incorporating studies about TPZ for H. pylori infection have been found. In response to this gap, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of RCTs examining the efficacy and safety of P-CAB-based therapies (including both VPZ and TPZ) compared to PPI-based therapy in individuals infected with H. pylori. In addition, we performed subgroup analyses to elucidate the impact of various factors on treatment outcomes, including drug history, experimental drug used, duration of treatment, combination treatment regimens, and country of study.

### The role of vonoprazan in patients with erosive esophagitis [^113sMFRY]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Table 3.
Summary of vonoprazan on the maintenance treatment of EE.

Results of comparative studies comparing vonoprazan and PPIs may depend on choice of PPIs and the way of administration. Miwa H et al tried to compare the maintenance efficacy of vonoprazan versus different PPIs by a Bayesian network meta-analysis, which combines both direct and indirect evidence of 22 randomized controlled trials, and found that the maintenance effect of vonoprazan 10 mg was superior to esomeprazole 10 mg and omeprazole 10 mg, with odds ratios of 13.92 (95% CI 1.70–114.21), 9.23 (95% CI 1.17–68.72), respectively. No superiority of vonoprazan 10 mg was demonstrated to rabeprazole 10 mg as well as lansoprazole 15 mg. Vonoprazan 20 mg showed superior maintenance effect to all of the above PPIs. Further direct head-to-head comparison trials are necessary to compare the efficacy of vonoprazan with different PPIs for the maintenance treatment of EE.

PPI-resistant EE

Around 10–15% of patients of EE do not achieve complete mucosal healing and symptom control despite 8-week double-dose PPI therapies, which may be attribute to the lack of sufficient acid inhibition, persistent non-acid reflux, reflux sensitivity as well as non-GERD causes. A study using esophageal impedance-pH testing demonstrated that pathological reflux cannot be completely decreased even on twice-daily PPI treatment, especially during nocturnal period, while vonoprazan exhibits its acid inhibitory effect for both daytime and nighttime. There is inter-patient variability in efficacy of PPIs due to CYP2C19 metabolism, which is distinct from vonoprazan as it is metabolized mainly via CYP3A pathway. The action of PPIs relies on the gastric acid activation and requires mealtime dosing to ensure adequate effect, leading to poor compliance with PPIs. One study found less than 50% of patients to be compliant with once-daily PPI use by 3 months. The absorption of vonoprazan is not affected by food intake and can be administered regardless of meal, thus resulting in better compliance.

### Comparison of vonoprazan and proton pump inhibitors for the treatment of gastric endoscopic submucosal dissection-induced ulcer: an updated systematic review and meta-analysis [^112Ju68h]. BMC Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Both vonoprazan and proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are currently used to treat acid-related disorders, including artificial ulcers, after ESD. Some studies have shown that vonoprazan is more effective than PPIs for healing artificial ulcers after ESD. On the other hand, some studies have shown that vonoprazan and PPIs are comparable in the treatment of ESD-induced ulcers. However, whether vonoprazan is superior to PPIs remains controversial. Therefore, a meta-analysis based on RCTs was conducted to clarify the effects of vonoprazan and PPIs on the healing of artificial ulcers.

According to our meta-analysis, there were no significant differences in the ulcer healing rate or shrinkage rate at 4 or 8 weeks between patients treated with vonoprazan or PPIs. Of the nine RCTs included in this meta-analysis, seven RCTs showed that vonoprazan was as efficacious as PPIs in the treatment of gastric ulcers after ESD. In contrast, the meta-analysis by Liu et al. showed that vonoprazan had better efficacy in terms of ulcer shrinkage rates and healing. However, the strength of our meta-analysis is that all the included studies were RCTs, and two new well-designed studies were added. Our findings indicated that both vonoprazan and PPIs were adequate for the healing of artificial ulcers. Notably, artificial ulcers that occur after ESD develop in hypoacidic or normal environments and are relatively mild. The gastric mucosal defense mechanisms are functioning, and inflammation is more localized. Conversely, peptic ulcers occur in vulnerable locations with hyperacidity and extend deeper and laterally.

### Vonoprazan prevents low-dose aspirin-associated ulcer recurrence: randomised phase 3 study [^113ek7aa]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

Vonoprazan was well tolerated in the study. During long-term treatment, the safety profiles of the 10 mg and 20 mg doses were similar to that of lansoprazole 15 mg. Recent systematic reviews and meta-analyses have suggested a relationship between PPI use and increased risk of fractureand/or gastroenteritis infections induced by C. difficile. In the current study, the incidence of fracture was similar in all three treatment groups and no cases of gastroenteritis infections due to C. difficile were observed.

Long-term use of PPIs has also been associated with a potentially increased risk of GI cancer, possibly related to hypergastrinaemia, although the relationship is questionable. The two patients in 20 mg group who were reported with carcinoma were identified by the Central Evaluation Committee for being diagnosed retrospectively with cancer before the study drug administration. In the study of vonoprazan administered during the long-term NSAID therapy, we have identified no new safety issue.

As expected from previous vonoprazan studies, serum gastrin concentrations were higher with vonoprazan (both doses) compared with lansoprazole; however, no patients discontinued because of hypergastrinaemia. Similar changes in gastrin, pepsinogen I and II were reported in patients with GORD when treated with either vonoprazan or lansoprazole. The mechanism of such increase in these parameters are still unknown; however, other PPIs shown similar effects.

Concomitant use of PPIs and clopidogrel has been reported to possibly reduce the inhibitory action of clopidogrel on platelet aggregation. In the Kumamoto Intervention Conference Study, the cumulative incidence of cardiovascular events during 6 months of treatment was about 1.3% (value estimated from the published figure) in both the PPI group and non-PPI group in Japanese patients receiving dual therapy with LDA and clopidogrel or ticlopidine. In the current study, no cardiovascular event developed in 120 patients who concomitantly received clopidogrel and LDA.

### AGA clinical practice update on the management of refractory Helicobacter pylori infection: expert review [^114D5RpX]. Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Inadequate acid suppression may undermine eradication efforts through a variety of mechanisms, as detailed above. To this end, optimal dosing of PPIs is frequently overlooked when prescribing eradication therapy, but similar fine-tuning of the acid suppressive prescription may improve eradication outcomes in refractory H. pylori infection. (BPA #7) Providers should also confirm that patients are taking the PPI in a manner that maximizes absorption and activation; factors such as timing of PPI administration in relation to food (and types of foods) and the impact on absorption, as well as the impact of concomitant medications such as histamine H 2 receptor blockers on PPI activation should be studied further. Higher dosing, greater frequency (e.g. TID or QID PPI dosing), and the use of more potent PPIs (e.g. esomeprazole or rabeprazole) may be beneficial in cases of refractory H. pylori infection and similarly warrant further investigation. Vonoprazan, a first-in-class potassium-competitive acid blocker, is a potent intragastric acid suppressor that also bypasses CYP2C19 -dependent metabolism. Although not yet available in the US, trials comparing CYP2C19 -metabolized PPIs versus vonoprazan are ongoing in the US.

Finally, longer treatment durations provide higher eradication rates; thus, a 14-day therapeutic duration should be used for refractory H. pylori infection. (BPA #8)

After multiple failed eradication attempts, the potential benefits of H. pylori eradication should be weighed carefully against the likelihood of adverse effects and inconvenience of repeated high-dose acid suppression and antibiotic exposure, particularly among individuals who are not at identifiably higher risk of complications from persistent H. pylori infection (e.g. gastric cancer, peptic ulcer disease); in such scenarios, a shared decision-making approach should be seriously considered, especially in the elderly, those with frailty, and those with intolerance to antibiotics (BPA #9)

### The efficacy and safety of vonoprazan and tegoprazan ineradication: a comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^112fzYd5]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Potassium-competitive acid blocker (P-CAB)-based therapies are emerging as promising alternatives for eradicating Helicobacter pylori infection. However, the comparative efficacy of P-CAB-based therapy versus proton-pump inhibitor (PPI)-based therapy in treating H. pylori infection remains uncertain.

Objectives

This meta-analysis evaluated the efficacy and safety of P-CAB-based therapies, including Vonoprazan (VPZ) and Tegoprazan (TPZ), compared to PPI-based therapies for H. pylori infection. Subgroup analysis assessed the influence of drug history, experimental drug, treatment duration, combination therapies, and geographic regions on treatment outcomes.

Design

Meta-analysis.

Data Sources and Methods

Comprehensive searches were conducted in major databases, including PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, and Web of Science, up to January 1, 2024. The primary outcome was the eradication rate, analyzed by intention-to-treat (ITT). Secondary outcomes included adverse events. Heterogeneity among studies was assessed using the χ 2 test and the I 2 test. I 2 > 50% or p < 0.05 indicated significant heterogeneity.

Results

The analysis totally included 28 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comprising 37 studies and 8818 patients diagnosed with H. pylori infection. Of these, 14 RCTs, including 20 studies and 4286 patients, compared P-CAB-based therapy with 14-day bismuth-based quadruple therapy (BQT). P-CAB-based therapy exhibited superior eradication rates compared to both 14-day BQT and PPI-based therapy (ITT analysis: 87.0% vs 79.8%, risk ratio (RR) = 1.08, 95% CI: 1.04–1.12, p < 0.0001; and 85.6% vs 77.8%, RR = 1.09, 95% CI: 1.05–1.12, p < 0.00001, respectively). This enhanced efficacy was particularly pronounced in patients with clarithromycin-resistant infections (73.7% vs 41.5%, RR = 1.53, 95% CI: 1.07–2.20, p = 0.02). Subgroup analysis demonstrated higher eradication rates with P-CAB-based therapy in treatment-naïve participants, VPZ recipients, and those receiving 7- or 14-day regimens (dual, triple, or quadruple therapy). However, no significant differences were observed in treatment-experienced subgroups, TPZ recipients, or those on 10-day regimens. In addition, P-CAB-based therapy showed a lower incidence of adverse events than PPI-based treatments (RR = 0.73, 95% CI: 0.63–0.86, p < 0.0001).

Conclusion

P-CAB-based therapies are more effective than traditional PPI-based treatments for eradicating H. pylori infection, with a reduced incidence of adverse events.

### The status and progress of first-line treatment againstinfection: a review [^117ES8VX]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Vonoprazan

Vonoprazan, a new type of oral acid inhibitor, is an extraordinarily promising drug that was approved for use in Japan in 2015. It is a reversible H + -K + ATPase inhibitor with faster, stronger, and longer-lasting acid inhibitory effects than PPIs. – Most studies on vonoprazan were focused on triple therapy, and most were carried out in Japan. Recently, there have been some studies of vonoprazan-based dual treatment. In order to make better use of vonoprazan, trials need to be conducted outside East Asia and compared with PPIs in different regimens (such as CT, ST, and bismuth-containing therapy).

A meta-analysis that included only RCTs showed that triple therapy using vonoprazan as an alternative to PPI had a significantly higher eradication rate (91.4% versus 74.8%) and fewer adverse reactions (32.7% versus 40.5%). A large RCT in Japan compared the efficacy and safety between vonoprazan plus low-dose amoxicillin and vonoprazan triple therapy, and reported eradication rates of 84.5% and 89.2%, respectively, in ITT analysis, and 87.1% and 90.2%, respectively, in PP analysis. The regimen of vonoprazan plus low-dose amoxicillin achieved an eradication rate between 80% and 90%, which may be related to the fact that the course of treatment of the regimen lasted only 7 days and the dose of amoxicillin, and further trials are needed to determine a more appropriate course and dose. Clarithromycin may have no additional effect in first-line treatment when using vonoprazan. No significant difference was observed in the eradication rate between vonoprazan and vonoprazan plus clarithromycin regimens (85–90%) or between clarithromycin-resistant and -sensitive strains (ITT, 85% versus 87.6%; p = 0.7272). – The use of vonoprazan can increase the eradication rate of HP, but this effect is more obvious in young people; the eradication rate in elderly patients is significantly lower than that in young patients; the efficacy and safety in children are not clear.

### Vonoprazan fumarate, a novel potassium-competitive acid blocker, in the management of gastroesophageal reflux disease: safety and clinical evidence to date [^112tifqq]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Potassium-competitive acid blocker (P-CAB) is a class of drug that competitively blocks the potassium-binding site of H +, K + -adenosine triphosphate (ATP)ase. Although the history of this class of drugs started over 30 years ago, clinical use of two P-CABs, revaprazan and vonoprazan, were only recently approved in Korea and Japan, respectively. Among them, vonoprazan has several advantages over conventional proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs), including rapid onset of action, long duration of acid suppression, fewer interindividual variations in terms of acid suppression, and minimum dietary influence on its action. These advantages of vonoprazan have been proved in clinical trials conducted for license approvals for several acid-related diseases. In this review article, current evidence of vonoprazan in the management of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) will be summarized. Since the clinical trial data, as well as postmarketed clinical data, have consistently demonstrated superiority of vonoprazan over conventional PPIs in terms of achieving healing of mucosal breaks and maintaining the healing, it may provide an excellent, if not complete, option for fulfilling some of the unmet needs for current GERD therapy. The safety problem of vonoprazan is also discussed, as more pronounced hypergastrinemia inevitably ensues with its use.

### Incidence and type of adverse events in patients taking vonoprazan: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^117E5e9R]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Vonoprazan, a novel acid-suppressive drug, is non-inferior to proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) for the management of gastric acid-related diseases. However, the safety of vonoprazan has not been systematically evaluated yet.

Objectives

To elucidate the incidence and type of adverse events (AEs) in patients taking vonoprazan.

Design

Systematic review and meta-analysis.

Data Sources and Methods

PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library databases were searched for all studies reporting the safety of vonoprazan. The incidences of any AEs, drug-related AEs, serious AEs, AEs leading to drug discontinuation, and common AEs were pooled. Odds ratios (ORs) were calculated to compare the incidence of AEs between patients taking vonoprazan and PPIs.

Results

Seventy-seven studies were included. The pooled incidences of any AEs, drug-related AEs, serious AEs, and AEs leading to drug discontinuation were 20, 7, 1, and 1%, respectively. The incidences of any AEs (OR = 0.96, p = 0.66), drug-related AEs (OR = 1.10, p = 0.44), serious AEs (OR = 1.14, p = 0.36), and AEs leading to drug discontinuation (OR = 1.09, p = 0.55) were not significantly different between patients taking vonoprazan and PPIs. In subgroup analyses, patients with peptic ulcer disease (PUD) had higher incidences of any AEs, serious AEs, and AEs leading to drug discontinuation than those with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection, and artificial ulcer after gastric endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD), but patients with H. pylori infection had a higher incidence of drug-related AEs than those with PUD, GERD, and artificial ulcer after gastric ESD. The incidence of AEs was higher in patients taking long-term use of vonoprazan than those taking short-term use of vonoprazan.

Conclusion

Vonoprazan is well tolerated and shows similar safety compared to PPIs. The safety of vonoprazan may be primarily influenced by its indications and duration.

### The efficacy and safety of vonoprazan and tegoprazan ineradication: a comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^111q3jgt]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

In addition to antibiotic resistance and patient non-adherence, inadequate acid suppression is a significant factor contributing to H. pylori eradication failures. Utilizing higher dosages or more potent acid-suppressing drugs to increase gastric pH is a proven strategy for enhancing H. pylori eradication. It is documented that H. pylori enters a growth phase and becomes more susceptible to antibiotics at a gastric pH of 6–8. However, the acid suppression achieved by currently available PPIs typically does not reach or maintain the required level or duration over a full 24-h period to achieve this optimal gastric environment. The introduction of P-CAB has revolutionized the approach to gastric acid suppression, making it more straightforward and efficacious. P-CABs offer more rapid, potent, and enduring acid suppression compared to PPIs, which has been associated with higher H. pylori eradication rates. Based on this theoretical foundation, we performed a subanalysis comparing P-CAB with the second-generation PPIs (esomeprazole and rabeprazole), known for more efficient acid inhibition than first-generation PPIs and are less affected by the CYP2C19 genotype, under conditions where the type and dosage of the combined drug were consistent. The result showed a significant difference in eradication rate between the P-CAB-based and esomeprazole/rabeprazole-based therapies (pooled eradication rates: 88.9% vs 84.0%, RR = 1.06, 95% CI: 1.02–1.10, p = 0.007), supporting the proposition that the more profound suppression of gastric acidity achieved with P-CABs, compared to PPIs, enhances antibiotic effectiveness.

### Efficacy and safety comparison oferadication between vonoprazan dual therapytriple therapy: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114pcdb6]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Many studieshave suggested that VPZ is superior to PPI in H. pylori eradication treatment. According to Dong et al.the actual cure rate of H. pylori infections was 92.6% for VPZ treatment and only 74.1% for PPI treatment, with a significant statistical difference. On one hand, VPZ can ensure a gastric pH above 7, preventing H. pylori from colonizing by inhibiting urease activity. Homeless H. pylori is more easily killed by antibiotics. On the other hand, VPZ can still inhibit acid secretion without the proton pump activated. This was a great difference from PPI. Through this mechanism, the acid secretion function of gastric epithelial cells can be inhibited more comprehensively and completely. Last but not least, the potent acid inhibition of VPZ is not influenced by CYP2C19 genotype, which is a well-known factor that failed for patients who eradicate H. pylori. Therefore, we suggested that the stronger, faster, and longer-lasting effect of VPZ on gastric acid suppression than PPI that was a crucial factor for VPZ to be a H. pylori eradication treatment candidate.

### Vonoprazan prevents ulcer recurrence during long-term NSAID therapy: randomised, lansoprazole-controlled non-inferiority and single-blind extension study [^112JgFhB]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

Vonoprazan, a potassium-competitive acid blocker (P-CAB), inhibits H +, K + -ATPase at the final stage of the acid secretory pathway in gastric parietal cells. Unlike PPIs, vonoprazan competes with potassium to inhibit the H +, K + -ATPase and also does not require acid-induced activation. While PPIs typically require approximately 3–5 days to exert a maximal effect on gastric acid secretion, P-CABs produce strong and long-lasting inhibitory activity from the first dose. Results from a drug–drug interaction study showed that the pharmacokinetics of vonoprazan and NSAIDs (loxoprofen sodium, diclofenac sodium, meloxicam) were not affected during concomitant administration of repeated doses. The similar efficacy of vonoprazan and lansoprazole for the healing of gastric and duodenal ulcers has been demonstrated in a randomised clinical trial in patients with gastric and duodenal ulcers.

The aim of the current studies was to evaluate the non-inferiority of vonoprazan to lansoprazole for secondary prevention of peptic ulcers in patients requiring NSAID therapy for pain management and to evaluate the safety and tolerability of vonoprazan during extended use.

### A randomized, double-blind study to evaluate the acid-inhibitory effect of vonoprazan (20 mg and 40 mg) in patients with proton-pump inhibitor-resistant erosive esophagitis [^114vKoqU]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Standard treatment for patients with erosive esophagitis (EE) is proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs), but some patients are resistant to PPIs. We aimed to evaluate the acid-inhibitory effects and efficacy of a novel potassium-competitive acid blocker (vonoprazan) in patients with PPI-resistant EE.

Methods

This randomized, double-blind, multicenter study of vonoprazan evaluated gastric and esophageal pH over a 24-hour period as the primary endpoint and EE healing rate as the secondary endpoint. Following a 7 to 14-day run-in period (lansoprazole 30 mg treatment), patients with endoscopically confirmed PPI-resistant EE received vonoprazan 20 mg or 40 mg for 8 weeks.

Results

Patients were randomized to receive vonoprazan 20 mg (n = 9) or 40 mg (n = 10). Over a 24-hour period; both groups showed a significant increase from baseline in the percentage of time gastric pH ≥ 4, referred to as pH 4 holding time ratio (HTR): an increase from 73.21% to 96.46% in the 20 mg group, and from 69.97% to 100.00% in the 40 mg group. Increases from baseline in esophageal pH 4 HTRs were not significant. The 40 mg group showed greater increases in gastric and esophageal pH 4 HTRs compared with the 20 mg group, but differences between groups were not significant. After 8 weeks' treatment, the healing rate in subjects with baseline EE grades A-D was 60.0% (3/5 patients) in the 20 mg group and 71.4% (5/7 patients) in the 40 mg group. Vonoprazan was generally well tolerated. One patient (40 mg group) experienced four treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) (unrelated to study drug), leading to study discontinuation.

Conclusions

Vonoprazan 20 mg and 40 mg effectively inhibited gastric acid secretion over a 24-hour period with significantly increased gastric pH 4 HTR, and resulted in an EE healing rate > 60.0% in this study. Vonoprazan treatment may be valuable for patients with PPI-resistant EE.

Discussion

This is the first randomized, controlled trial to evaluate the acid-inhibitory effect and efficacy of vonoprazan in patients with PPI-resistant EE. This study demonstrated that vonoprazan at doses of 20 mg and 40 mg can effectively inhibit gastric acid secretion over 24 hours. Indication of the efficacy of vonoprazan was suggested by EE healing rates of 44.4% (4/9 patients) and 55.6% (5/9 patients) in the 20 mg and 40 mg groups, respectively. Vonoprazan was found to have a favorable safety and tolerability profile, with all TEAEs being mild or moderate in severity. Together, these results indicate that vonoprazan could be an effective and well tolerated treatment for patients with EE that is resistant to PPIs.

The strengths of this study include the fact that it was a randomized, double-blind, multicenter trial, and the fact that the presence of PPI-resistant EE in each patient was confirmed by endoscopy. Furthermore, data on both efficacy (healing rate) and gastroesophageal pH levels were recorded for each patient, allowing a closer examination of the association between acid inhibition and healing of PPI-resistant EE. This study was limited by the small sample size and the lack of a placebo or active control arm. Although the natural healing of reflux esophagitis after failure of PPI is possible, the acid-suppressive effects seen with vonoprazan in this study suggest that our findings are unlikely to be spurious. Another limitation is the fact that efficacy was based solely on the proportion of patients demonstrating complete healing of mucosal breaks. Moreover, the interpretation of the results was complicated by discrepancies between the investigator's and the CAC's endoscopic assessment of LA Grade at baseline.

### The role of vonoprazan in patients with erosive esophagitis [^113dvAku]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Acid suppression is the primary therapy for erosive esophagitis (EE). Although proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are considered as the first-line medication for EE, 10–20% of patients with Los Angeles C and D grade EE do not gain complete mucosal healing and symptom control despite 8-week double-dose PPI treatment. Vonoprazan is a novel potassium-competitive acid blocker (P-CAB), which blocks the H +, K + -adenosine triphosphatase enzymes in a K + -competitive and reversible manner. Vonoprazan exhibits different pharmacological and pharmacokinetic profiles from conventional PPIs, and has a rapid, potent and sustained acid inhibitory effect. In this review, we summarized and discussed current evidence regarding the role of vonoprazan in terms of mucosal healing, maintaining remission and symptom relief for the management of EE, including the initial and maintenance treatment of EE, as well as for PPI-resistant EE patients. Safety concerns and cost-effectiveness analysis of vonoprazan were also mentioned in the article. As a potent and well-tolerated acid blocker, vonoprazan has the potential to become a novel option for the management of EE.

Pharmacological and pharmacokinetic profiles of vonoprazan

Notable differences of vonoprazan in pharmacological and pharmacokinetic profiles from traditional PPIs have been demonstrated. Matsukawa J, et al. performed an animal experiment using primary cultured rabbit gastric glands with 2-h pre-incubation of either vonoprazan or lansoprazole, vonoprazan has a high level of accumulation in both the resting and the actively secreting oxyntic gastric glands while lansoprazole only accumulated in resting glands, which suggested that the effect of vonoprazan does not rely on the gastric acid activation. Moreover, as shown in Japanese and UK phase I studies, 20 mg of vonoprazan resulted in almost the same maximum concentration as well as area under the curve from time 0 to 48 h (AUC 0–48 h) values under satiated and fasting conditions. Another recent phase I study conducted in healthy male and female Caucasian subjects exhibited similar results. Therefore, the absorption of vonoprazan is not affected by food intake, and it can be administered regardless of meal, leading to higher medication compliance than that of PPIs. Vonoprazan is lipophilic and weak bases characterized by a higher pKa value of 9.06 than that of PPIs (3.8–5.0), thus making it highly accumulated and protonated instantly in the acid space such as the parietal cells. Meanwhile, vonoprazan is an acid-stable, water-soluble pyrrole and can be administered in immediate-release formulations, and therefore has a rapid absorption. As demonstrated in healthy subjects, rapid maximal plasma concentration was achieved after oral administration of vonoprazan with T max of up to 2 h as well as an estimated elimination half-life of up to 9 h, which was higher than that of conventional PPIs (1–2 h). These characteristics lead to a rapid onset and prolonged action of its acid inhibitory effect starting from the first day of administration. This was supported by a crossover study to evaluate the acid-inhibitory effects of vonoprazan versus two control PPIs (esomeprazole and rabeprazole) in healthy adult male subjects. It was found that vonoprazan (20 mg) exhibited greater gastric pH 4 holding time ratio (HTR) than esomeprazole (20 mg) or rabeprazole (10 mg) on both days 1 and 7. In addition, vonoprazan is metabolized in the liver mainly via CYP3A pathway of cytochrome P450, which is distinct from PPIs whose metabolisms are mostly via CYP2C19 pathway. Therefore, there is less influence of the CYP2C19 polymorphism on drug exposure of vonoprazan. An exploratory study conducted in healthy Japanese volunteers with mixed CYP2C19 genotypes found that pH 4 HTR and pH 5 HTR were higher with vonoprazan 20 mg than those with esomeprazole 20 mg irrespective of CYP2C19 status.

### Amelioration of obsessive-compulsive disorder by intracellular acidification of cortical neurons with a proton pump inhibitor [^114GvQt2]. Translational Psychiatry (2024). Medium credibility.

Hyperactivity in the OFC is related to OCD-like symptoms. In patients with OCD, there is a positive correlation between neural activity in the lateral OFC and symptom severity. Moreover, chronic administration of SSRIs normalises the lateral OFC activity only in SSRI-responsive patients with OCD. Consistent with these reports, we previously found that QNP-treated mice exhibit hyperactivity in the lateral OFC pyramidal neurons, which was suppressed by the 4-week administration of SSRI. In this study, a single administration of vonoprazan successfully decreased the neural activity of lateral OFC pyramidal neurons. These acute inhibitory effects of vonoprazan on neural activity in the lateral OFC may result in its rapid therapeutic efficacy against OCD-like behaviours.

In patients with OCD, symptoms can be classified into several subtypes known as symptom dimensions, which show different therapeutic responses toward medication. Consistent with these reports, 4-week SSRI administration in QNP-treated mice improved maladaptive habits. However, it did not affect repetitive behaviour, suggesting that it is an 'SSRI-resistant' OCD-like behaviour. Since vonoprazan inhibited both repetitive and maladaptive behaviours, our findings indicate that vonoprazan is a rapid-acting, effective treatment for SSRI-resistant symptoms.

Since both vonoprazan and long-term SSRI administration reduced the firing activity of the lateral OFC pyramidal neurons, differences in their behaviour modulation require clarification. The differences could be attributed to differences in the mechanisms of action in the lateral OFC. We previously demonstrated that in the lateral OFC pyramidal neurons of QNP-treated mice, there is an increase and decrease in excitatory and inhibitory inputs, respectively. Chronic SSRI use improves this abnormal excitatory/inhibitory balance by potentiating the inhibitory tone.

In contrast, vonoprazan directly acts on pyramidal neurons and inhibits depolarisation-induced action potential generation, showing a more potent inhibitory effect even under potentiated excitatory inputs. Additionally, this data did not exclude the effects of vonoprazan on excitatory inputs from outside the lateral OFC or interneurons within the lateral OFC. Since abnormalities in both excitatory and inhibitory inputs in the lateral OFC have been reported in mice with OCD-related dysfunctions, future studies investigating the effects on excitatory/inhibitory balance are necessary to elucidate the therapeutic potential of vonoprazan and conventional PPIs.

### Incidence and type of adverse events in patients taking vonoprazan: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115QdTyv]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background:

Vonoprazan, a novel acid-suppressive drug, is non-inferior to proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) for the management of gastric acid-related diseases. However, the safety of vonoprazan has not been systematically evaluated yet.

Objectives:

To elucidate the incidence and type of adverse events (AEs) in patients taking vonoprazan.

Design:

Systematic review and meta-analysis.

Data sources and methods:

PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library databases were searched for all studies reporting the safety of vonoprazan. The incidences of any AEs, drug-related AEs, serious AEs, AEs leading to drug discontinuation, and common AEs were pooled. Odds ratios (ORs) were calculated to compare the incidence of AEs between patients taking vonoprazan and PPIs.

Results:

Seventy-seven studies were included. The pooled incidences of any AEs, drug-related AEs, serious AEs, and AEs leading to drug discontinuation were 20, 7, 1, and 1%, respectively. The incidences of any AEs (OR = 0.96, p = 0.66), drug-related AEs (OR = 1.10, p = 0.44), serious AEs (OR = 1.14, p = 0.36), and AEs leading to drug discontinuation (OR = 1.09, p = 0.55) were not significantly different between patients taking vonoprazan and PPIs. In subgroup analyses, patients with peptic ulcer disease (PUD) had higher incidences of any AEs, serious AEs, and AEs leading to drug discontinuation than those with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection, and artificial ulcer after gastric endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD), but patients with H. pylori infection had a higher incidence of drug-related AEs than those with PUD, GERD, and artificial ulcer after gastric ESD. The incidence of AEs was higher in patients taking long-term use of vonoprazan than those taking short-term use of vonoprazan.

Conclusion:

Vonoprazan is well tolerated and shows similar safety compared to PPIs. The safety of vonoprazan may be primarily influenced by its indications and duration.

### Phase III, randomised, double-blind, multicentre study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of vonoprazan compared with lansoprazole in Asian patients with erosive oesophagitis [^1173pB7P]. Gut (2020). Medium credibility.

Efficacy

Non-inferiority (determined based on the lower CI being ≥ –10%) of vonoprazan compared with lansoprazole in terms of EO healing rate at 8 weeks was demonstrated and thus the primary efficacy endpoint was met (figure 2A). The 8-week healing rate was 92.4% (n = 220) with vonoprazan and 91.3% (n = 210) with lansoprazole (difference: 1.1% (95% CI –3.822% to 6.087%)). The 2-week healing rate was 75.0% (n = 177) in the vonoprazan group and 67.8% (n = 154) in the lansoprazole group (difference: 7.2% (95% CI –1.054% to 15.371%)) (figure 2A). The healing rate at 4 weeks was 85.3% (n = 203) in the vonoprazan group and 83.5% (n = 192) in the lansoprazole group (difference: 1.8% (95% CI –4.763% to 8.395%)) (figure 2A). Treatment differences with respect to endoscopic healing of EO at 2 and 4 weeks were not statistically significant. The superiority of vonoprazan 20 mg treatment to lansoprazole 30 mg treatment was not demonstrated at 2 weeks.

Table 1.
Effect of vonoprazan and different PPIs on intragastric pH.

Previous trials have demonstrated greater acid-inhibitory effect of vonoprazan 20 mg daily compared with a PPI of standard daily dosing. In a randomized open-label crossover study involving 20 healthy Japanese male adults, the pH 4 HTR of vonoprazan 20 mg daily was significantly higher than that of esomeprazole 20 mg daily or rabeprazole 10 mg daily on both days 1 and 7. In addition, the day 1 to day 7 ratio of pH 4 HTRs was greater with vonoprazan than that was with esomeprazole or rabeprazole (> 0.8, 0.370, 0.393, respectively). A recent phase I trial from U.S. subjects also exhibited the higher pH 4 HTR with vonoprazan 20 mg daily than that with lansoprazole 30 mg daily on day 1 and day 7 (62.4% versus 22.6%, 87.8% versus 42.3%, both p < 0.0001). In a study involving 28 healthy Japanese volunteers, median pH 4 HTR of vonoprazan 20 mg daily was greater than that of esomeprazole 20 mg daily or twice daily (95% versus 68%, p < 0.001; 95% versus 91%, p = 0.019). Since vonoprazan is a very potent and long-acting acid inhibitor, the proper comparison is probably a PPI with standard or higher doses administered twice daily (BID). More recently, Takeuchi T, et al conducted a crossover study to evaluate the acid-inhibitory effect of the standard dose of vonoprazan versus rabeprazole 10/20 mg BID in three cohorts of 10 healthy Japanese volunteers, and found that the pH 4 HTR of vonoprazan 20 mg daily was greater than those of rabeprazole 10 mg BID (88.4% versus 53.8%; p = 0.001) and rabeprazole 20 mg BID (95.0% versus 74.5%; p = 0.0015). Thus, vonoprazan exerts a more potent and durable acid-inhibitory effect compared with 2–4 times the standard daily dose of rabeprazole administered in two divided doses.

Overall, vonoprazan displays a rapid, potent and sustained acid inhibitory effect, and seems to have the potential to become a new therapeutic option in the management of GERD from a clinical standpoint.

### The role of P-CABs in GERD [^113xaFEw]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Potassium-competitive acid blockers (P-CABs) constitute a relatively new class of gastric acid-suppressing drugs. Among this class, vonoprazan is the first to have been approved in the United States. However, some P-CABs including vonoprazan, tegoprazan, and fexuprazan have been available in other countries since at least 2014. The first aim of this article is to review pharmacological differences between P-CABs that are currently approved or in development with proton pump inhibitors. The specific focus thereafter is on the likely role of P-CABs in the treatment of different manifestations of gastroesophageal reflux disease. Multiple clinical trials have compared P-CABs with proton pump inhibitors in erosive esophagitis. Additional trials have compared P-CABs with placebo in nonerosive reflux disease. Relevant results are reviewed, and inferences are drawn for their use in the United States. Finally, consideration is given to additional, potential uses of P-CABs in the broader spectrum of gastroesophageal reflux disease, and some suggestions are made for future research initiatives.

We must also determine whether short‐term treatment leads to better healing. For instance, PPI therapy may promote the microscopic healing of the mucosa and restore its integrity, which may not be visible during white‐light endoscopy. If the treatment duration is insufficient, mucosal integrity may not be fully restored even if EE is healed.

Regarding GERD symptoms, tegoprazan displays rapid onset of antisecretory activity and suppresses nocturnal acidity quicker than vonoprazan does. In this study, however, the difference in heartburn‐free days between tegoprazan and lansoprazole did not reach statistical significance (Figure 3). This may be attributed to a type II error such as a small sample size. Moreover, as asymptomatic EE patients were also eligible to participate in this study, the secondary outcomes of symptom improvement did not yield significant results (Table S1). Nevertheless, the percentage of complete resolution in heartburn symptoms for tegoprazan was 52.9% from the first day of administration, which was equivalent to that for lansoprazole on the fourth day (59.6%, Figure 3A). In a recent RCT, tegoprazan in patients with non‐erosive reflux disease (NERD) showed a significantly greater alleviation of heartburn symptoms compared to the placebo. These findings were also comparable to a previous small clinical trial of vonoprazan. Considering the action mechanism of P‐CABs, these findings can be advantageous in shortening the treatment period and determining treatment effectiveness of acid‐suppressive drugs in patients with GERD.

Safety profile of vonoprazan

The safety of a new drug is always a concern for clinicians; thus, the safety profile of vonoprazan has been investigated throughout the course of its clinical development. In phase I studies, vonoprazan at all tested doses was safe and well tolerated in healthy male volunteers, as compared with placebo or PPIs. During the phase II and III studies, the common adverse events of vonoprazan were nasopharyngitis, diarrhea, as well as dyspepsia with mild to moderate degree and well tolerated. Comparable incidence rates of adverse events were observed between vonoprazan (22.2%–47.4%) and lansoprazole (22.3%–43.9%). – The incidence of adverse events of vonoprazan in the maintenance treatment of up to 52 weeks was higher than that in short-term treatment, although the common adverse events were similar. In a phase III study comparing vonoprazan and lansoprazole for preventing ulcer recurrence during long-term non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug therapy, the safety profiles of vonoprazan of both 10 mg and 20 mg doses were similar to that of lansoprazole 15 mg over 104 weeks of therapy. Adverse events for which a causal relationship could not be eliminated occurred in less than 20% of patients in each group, and no new safety issue was identified.

Given that vonoprazan resulted in high (> 80%) pH 4 HTRs in this study, as well as in previous studies, it was predicted that vonoprazan would be successful in healing the PPI-resistant EE in these patients. Previous studies in patients with EE have shown that treatment with vonoprazan, even with doses as low as 5 mg, resulted in healing rates of > 92% after 4 weeks. Following 8 weeks of treatment with 20 mg of vonoprazan, the healing rate was 99%. Vonoprazan, at both 20 mg and 40 mg, was also shown to be noninferior to lansoprazole 30 mg in terms of efficacy.

In this study, both doses of vonoprazan were effective in healing PPI-resistant EE, albeit at lower healing rates than observed for patients with EE. The moderate overall healing rate observed may be partly explained by the small sample size, which was reduced further by the fact that the healing analysis excluded a significant proportion (32%) of patients who were classified by the CAC as having no mucosal breaks at baseline (the investigator had classified these same patients as having Grades A–D EE at baseline). Vonoprazan did appear to increase gastric pH in nonhealed patients, so factors other than effects on pH may have contributed to lack of healing. Possible reasons for the lack of observed healing may include reflux of bile juices and atypical presentation of EE (e.g. mucosal break in the middle of the esophagus).

### Vonoprazan triple and dual therapy for Helicobacter pylori infection in the United States and Europe: randomized clinical trial [^11388iZv]. Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background & Aims

Novel, effective treatments for Helicobacter pylori infection are needed. This study evaluated the efficacy of vonoprazan, a potassium-competitive acid blocker, vs standard treatment on H pylori eradication in the United States and Europe.

Methods

In a randomized, controlled, phase 3 trial, treatment-naïve adults with H pylori infection were randomized 1:1:1 to open-label vonoprazan dual therapy (20 mg vonoprazan twice daily; 1 g amoxicillin 3 times daily), or double-blind triple therapy twice a day (vonoprazan 20 mg or lansoprazole 30 mg; amoxicillin 1 g; clarithromycin 500 mg) for 14 days. The primary outcome was noninferiority in eradication rates in patients without clarithromycin- and amoxicillin-resistant strains (noninferiority margin = 10%). Secondary outcomes assessed superiority in eradication rates in clarithromycin-resistant infections, and in all patients.

Results

A total of 1046 patients were randomized. Primary outcome eradication rates (nonresistant strains): vonoprazan triple therapy 84.7%, dual therapy 78.5%, vs lansoprazole triple therapy 78.8% (both noninferior; difference 5.9%; 95% confidence interval [CI] -0.8 to 12.6; P < .001; difference -0.3%; 95% CI, -7.4 to 6.8; p = 0.007, respectively).

In all patients, vonoprazan triple and dual therapy were superior to lansoprazole triple therapy (80.8% and 77.2%, respectively, vs 68.5%, difference 12.3%; 95% CI, 5.7–18.8; P < .001; difference 8.7%; 95% CI, 1.9–15.4; p = 0.013). Overall frequency of treatment-emergent adverse events was similar between vonoprazan and lansoprazole regimens (P > .05).

Conclusion

Both vonoprazan-based regimens were superior to proton pump inhibitor-based triple therapy in clarithromycin-resistant strains and in the overall study population.

### The role of vonoprazan in patients with erosive esophagitis [^114H4KLC]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Vonoprazan, a new P-CAB

Both PPIs and P-CABs act on gastric H +, K + -adenosine triphosphatase (H + /K + -ATPase), which is responsible for the critical final step of the gastric acid section.PPIs block the action of H + /K + ATPase of active phase by irreversible covalent binding, acidic environment is needed for its activation. In contrast to PPIs, P-CABs inhibit the H + /K + ATPase of both active and resting phase by reversible K + -competitive ionic binding independent of gastric acid activation.

Clinical development of P-CABs

Many candidate compounds categorized as P-CABs have been developed since 1980s. SCH28080 and linaprazan (AZD0865), which are imidazopyridine derivatives, are the first batch of prototype P-CABs. However, the clinical development of them was discontinued due to dose-related hepatotoxicity concerns or limited clinical benefit compared with PPIs in terms of mucosal healing and symptom relief. – Revaprazan (YH1885), which is pyrimidine derivative, is the first P-CAB developed for clinical use, and is approved for the treatment of duodenal ulcer and gastric ulcer in South Korea. Revaprazan exhibited similar efficacy as conventional PPIs in terms of gastric acid control. Vonoprazan (TAK-438), based on the pyrrole structure, is the second P-CAB introduced in clinical use. The efficacy and safety of vonoprazan for the treatment of EE has been reported in recent clinical trials, which is summarized and discussed later in the current review. Tegoprazan, which is based on the benzimidazole structure, is a latest P-CAB currently under development and has recently showed potential for the treatment of GERD and peptic ulcers.

### American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy guideline on the diagnosis and management of GERD: methodology and review of evidence [^117P6hzH]. VideoGIE (2025). Medium credibility.

The panel also discussed the newer potassium channel competitive acid blockers (PCABs) and their positioning in the GERD management. These agents were not readily available in North America at the time of evidence review and panel meeting. A recent RCT demonstrated effectiveness of Vonoprazan over lansoprazole for healing and maintenance of healing of erosive esophagitis. A recent systematic review and meta-analysis (19 studies, 7023 subjects) also showed that Vonoprazan is superior to PPI in first-line Helicobacter pylori eradication and erosive esophagitis but noninferior in other gastric acid–related diseases. Panel agreed unanimously that existing data do not show superiority of PCABs for PPIs overall for GERD but likely that PCABs are more potent for erosive esophagitis and that their long-term adverse event data are not available. The panel, however, also agreed that with evolving data, PCABs likely will be used for confirmed patients with GERD after discussion of existing data and risks and benefits.

Question 5(a): In patients with persistent GERD, how does transoral incisionless fundoplication (TIF) compare to standard medical therapy?

Recommendation 5(a):

In patients with confirmed GERD with small hiatal hernia (≤ 2 cm) and Hill grade I or II who meet any of the following criteria, the ASGE suggests evaluation for TIF as an alternative to long-term medical management.

Criteria:

- Chronic GERD (at least 6 months)
- Long-term proton pump inhibitor (PPI) use (at least 6 months) for management of GERD symptoms
- Refractory GERD
- Regurgitation-predominant GERD
- Patient prefers to avoid long-term PPI use (Conditional recommendation, low quality of evidence)

### Efficacy and safety comparison oferadication between vonoprazan dual therapytriple therapy: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116XffAo]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

As a novel potassium-competitive acid blocker, vonoprazan (VPZ) has been developed and gained increasing attention. VPZ noncovalently combines with K+/H+-ATPase through hydrogen and ionic bonds, competing for acting sites of K+ and inhibiting the conformational change of the K+/H+-ATPase, which leads to enzyme inactivation, eventually reducing gastric acid secretion. According to a recent randomized controlled trial (RCT) reported in Japan, VPZ provides a stronger and longer-lasting effect on gastric acid suppression than other PPIs. Therefore, its application in the treatment of H. pylori infections is expected to improve the actual cure rate of H. pylori infections. A meta-analysis by Jung et al.showed that the actual cure rates of VPZ-containing versus PPI-containing first-line triple therapies were 85.1% versus 68.0% in an intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis, and there was a significant difference between the two groups [relative risk (95% confidence interval), CI = 1.19 (1.15–1.24)]. The safety of VPZ versus PPI for H. pylori eradication therapies showed that there was no significant difference [RR (95% CI) = 1.02 (0.78–1.34)]. Therefore, VPZ may be an alternative to PPI as an eradication therapy for H. pylori infections.

Obviously, problems such as antimicrobial resistance increased; serious side effects and high costs are also associated with VPZ triple therapy. VPZ provides quicker, stronger, and longer-lasting effects on gastric acid suppression compared to PPIs. Therefore, we expect better efficacy of dual therapy composed of VPZ and AMO. We also expect VPZ dual therapy not to contribute to the development of H. pylori antibiotic resistance. However, many studies have reported that the efficacy and safety of VPZ dual therapy were similar to triple therapy, even though VPZ dual therapy was recommended, but with high-dose antibiotics. And only a few studies have reported the actual cure rate of VPZ dual therapy and triple therapy in CLA-resistant infections, so we wanted to perform a meta-analysis to discuss whether the VPZ + AMO dual therapy has a clear advantage over VPZ + AMO + CLA triple therapy.

### Awareness, attitudes, and clinical utilization of vonoprazan for Helicobacter pylori infection and gastroesophageal reflux disease among Chinese physicians: a nationwide cross-sectional study [^1175Wa43]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Some respondents suggested that vonoprazan could be used for conditions such as gastroduodenal ulcers, corticosteroid-associated mucosal injury, or variceal bleeding in cirrhosis. These views appear to extrapolate from vonoprazan's potent acid suppression rather than from clinical evidence. To our knowledge, interventional or robust observational studies supporting vonoprazan in these settings are lacking. Therefore, these viewpoints should be viewed as hypotheses for future study rather than viable indications. Appropriately designed clinical studies would be required to evaluate safety and efficacy before any such uses could be considered.

Our findings complement and extend those of a recent national survey of gastroenterologists on high-dose dual therapy for H. pylori infection in China. That study primarily targeted gastroenterology specialists and reported high awareness and adoption of high-dose dual therapy among this group. However, unlike dual therapy, which has gained visibility through domestic guideline endorsement and clinical society promotion, vonoprazan remains relatively new to most clinicians in China.

Internationally, adoption patterns of vonoprazan demonstrate marked regional variation. In Japan, where vonoprazan was first introduced in 2015, uptake has been widespread and supported by favorable real-world outcomes in both H. pylori eradication and GERD management. In South Korea, use has been influenced by formulary access and the availability of alternative P-CABs, such as tegoprazan, which has led to competitive but diversified adoption patterns. In the United States, vonoprazan received FDA approval in 2022 for the treatment of H. pylori infection, but real-world adoption data remain scarce. Similarly, in European countries, the clinical use of vonoprazan is still at an early stage. The global comparisons demonstrated that awareness, access, and policy support play critical roles in driving vonoprazan adoption. While the pharmacologic advantages of vonoprazan are well established, its successful integration into clinical practice depends on systemic factors such as healthcare infrastructure, formulary inclusion, reimbursement support, and physician education. These enabling mechanisms are still evolving in China, limiting widespread adoption and consistent use.

### Vonoprazan fumarate (Voquezna) [^1119HEqw]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Absorption

Vonoprazan exhibits time-independent pharmacokinetics and steady state concentrations are achieved by Day 3 to 4. After multiple doses of vonoprazan ranging from 10 to 40 mg (twice the maximum recommended dose) once daily for 7 days in healthy subjects, Cmaxand area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) values for vonoprazan increased in an approximately dose-proportional manner.

There is little accumulation in plasma after once daily multiple doses, with an accumulation index ratio of less than 1.2 based on AUC for doses ranging from 10 to 40 mg (twice the maximum recommended dose).

Steady state plasma exposure of vonoprazan following 20 mg twice daily dosing (AUC0–12h = 273 hr*ng/mL, N = 10) was approximately 1.8-fold higher compared to the mean estimate from the same subjects on Day 1 (AUC0–12h = 155 hr*ng/mL, N = 10).

Effect of Food

In a food effect study in healthy subjects (N = 24) who received vonoprazan 20 mg, a high-fat meal resulted in a 5% increase in Cmax, a 15% increase in AUC, and a delay in median Tmaxof 2 hours. These changes are not considered to be clinically significant [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

Distribution

Plasma protein binding of vonoprazan ranged from 85 to 88% in healthy subjects and was independent of concentration from 0.1 to 10 mcg/mL.

Elimination

Metabolism

Vonoprazan is metabolized to inactive metabolites via multiple pathways by a combination of cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoforms (CYP3A4/5, CYP2B6, CYP2C19, CYP2C9 and CYP2D6) along with sulfo- and glucuronosyl-transferases. CYP2C19 polymorphisms have been evaluated in clinical studies and there were no considerable differences in the pharmacokinetics of vonoprazan based on CYP2C19 metabolizer status.

Excretion

Following oral administration of radiolabeled vonoprazan, approximately 67% of the radiolabeled dose (8% as unchanged vonoprazan) was recovered in urine and 31% (1.4% as unchanged vonoprazan) was recovered in feces.

Refractory Helicobacter pylori — acid suppression strategies and proton pump inhibitor (PPI) selection: Inadequate acid suppression may undermine eradication efforts and optimal dosing of PPIs is frequently overlooked; higher dosing, greater frequency (eg, 3- or 4-times daily PPI dosing), and the use of more potent PPIs (eg, esomeprazole or rabeprazole) may be beneficial in refractory infection. Vonoprazan is a potent intragastric acid suppressor that also bypasses CYP2C19-dependent metabolism, and although not yet available in the United States, trials comparing CYP2C19-metabolized PPIs vs vonoprazan are ongoing in the United States (NCT04167670 at clinicaltrials.gov).

### The role of vonoprazan in patients with erosive esophagitis [^116pzWK1]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a common acid-related disease caused by the reflux of gastroduodenal contents entering into the esophagus or mouth. It can be classified into non-erosive gastroesophageal reflux disease, erosive esophagitis (EE) and Barrett's esophagus according to the endoscopic manifestations. GERD is currently one of the most prevalent gastrointestinal diseases in Western countries and affects 13% of the population worldwide. Although it was once thought to be less common in Asian countries, the prevalence of GERD has now reached over 10% in Japan, China and India. GERD not only results in huge burden on health-related quality of life and work productivity, but also plays an important role in the occurrence of esophageal adenocarcinoma.

Acid suppression has been considered as the mainstay treatment for EE, and proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) represent the drug of choice in the last several decades. In spite of the proven acid-suppressing efficacy for symptom relief as well as mucosal healing, a few limitations related to PPIs have been reported lately. First of all, many early-generation PPIs show a delay in action onset, and several dose cycles may be needed that takes 3–5 days until maximal efficacy are fully reached. Besides, PPIs may be inadequate to fully overcome nocturnal acid breakthrough, and a histamine H2 receptor antagonist (H2RA) is usually required before bedtime to achieve better therapeutic gain. However, after a few weeks, tolerance does develop due to H2RA upregulation, resulting in reduced efficacy. It has been well documented that the current PPI treatment may not be sufficient for EE, and 10–20% of patients with Los Angeles C and D (LA-C/D) grade EE do not gain complete mucosal healing and symptom control despite 8-week double-dose PPI therapies. As a result, there is unmet need in the management of EE.

Vonoprazan (TAK-438), a novel potassium-competitive acid blocker (P-CAB), received its first global approval in 2014 and was launched in 2015 for use as an acid suppressant. In the present review, we discussed and summarized the current evidence regarding the efficacy and safety of vonoprazan in the management of EE.

### Amelioration of obsessive-compulsive disorder by intracellular acidification of cortical neurons with a proton pump inhibitor [^112LgJk9]. Translational Psychiatry (2024). Medium credibility.

Although we observed that vonoprazan and Atp4a KD only slightly decreased the intracellular pH, such manipulations successfully reduced neural excitability. One possible reason for such a small effect may be the recording condition. A tetrodotoxin-induced suppression of firing activity was used for pH measurements to assess the effects of vonoprazan and Atp4a KD on the intracellular pH independent of their effects on firing activity. However, as neural activity, such as excitatory inputs via NMDA receptors and depolarisation, can transiently lower intracellular pH, tetrodotoxin might decrease proton influx and reduce the effects of blockade of proton efflux via proton pumps. Additionally, neural activity-induced transient acidification is more prominent in dendrites than in the soma region. The previous report demonstrates that the current injection-induced activity of Purkinje cells can decrease dendritic pH up to 0.3 units. In comparison, average acidification in the soma regions is around 0.03 pH units. This finding also supports our hypothesis that, in the presence of neural activity, transient pH drop can be larger, at least locally, than observed here. However, further studies are needed to elucidate the actual pH shift induced in the presence of neuronal activity.

The exact mechanisms underlying acidification-induced activity modulation in neurons remain unclear, whereas numerous molecules alter their function in response to intracellular H + in the brain. Some channels may be partly involved in modulating neural activity through both toxic acidosis and physiological pH reduction, including tandem pore domain weak inward rectifier K + channel-related K + channels (TREKs) and high-voltage-activated voltage-dependent Ca 2+ channels. These observations suggest that a slight decrease in intracellular pH modulates pyramidal neuron activity in the lateral OFC. However, further studies are required to elucidate the detailed mechanisms through which vonoprazan inhibits neuronal activity through intracellular acidification.

In conclusion, this study demonstrated the efficacy of PPIs against OCD-like symptoms using data mining prediction with experimental validation. Among the PPIs, vonoprazan showed rapid and effective action against experimentally induced OCD-like behaviours. In the lateral OFC, vonoprazan inhibited neuronal hyperactivity, which could have been through intracellular acidification. These results provide new insights into the therapeutic strategies for OCD.

Study population

In order to be eligible for the study, patients had to be male or female, aged 20 years or older, and should have been receiving regular doses (or higher) of PPIs (lansoprazole 30 mg, omeprazole 20 mg, rabeprazole 10 or 20 mg, or esomeprazole 20 mg) for treatment of EE for at least 8 weeks until the start of the run-in period. At 2 days before the end of the run-in period, patients had to have endoscopically confirmed EE with an LA grade between A and D, despite previous treatment with regular (or higher) doses of PPIs and treatment with 30 mg of lansoprazole (compliance level ≥ 80%) during the run-in period. The main exclusion criteria were: esophageal complications other than Schatzki's ring and Barrett's esophagus; history of surgery or treatment affecting gastroesophageal reflux; upper gastrointestinal bleeding, or gastric or duodenal ulcer (characterized by a defective mucosa with white coating) at the start of the run-in period; currently or previously affected by Zollinger-Ellison syndrome; history of hypersensitivity or allergies to vonoprazan (including formulatory components) or PPIs; requiring treatment with excluded medications (medications for the gastrointestinal tract or for Helicobacter pylori eradication, strong CYP3A4 inhibitors, and other medications for which concomitant use with lansoprazole was contraindicated); serious neurological, cardiovascular, pulmonary, hepatic, renal, metabolic, gastrointestinal, urologic, endocrinologic, or hematologic disorders; presence of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome or hepatitis, or a positive test for the hepatitis B surface antigen or the hepatitis C virus antibody.

Randomization and treatment

During the run-in period, patients received 30 mg of lansoprazole orally once daily for at least 7 days and up to a maximum of 14 days. Randomization of the patients occurred at the end of the run-in period, following confirmation of EE (by endoscopy) by the study investigator, the day before the treatment period was due to begin. Patients were randomly assigned to receive 20 mg of vonoprazan or 40 mg of vonoprazan in a 1:1 ratio, according to a prespecified randomization schedule generated by randomization personnel designated by the sponsor. During the treatment period, patients received the designated dose of vonoprazan orally once daily for 8 weeks.

### Evaluating vonoprazan and tegoprazan for gastroesophageal reflux disease treatment in Chinese healthcare: an EVIDEM framework analysis [^111uewMA]. BMC Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In the context of GERD management, PPIs remain the primary drug treatment. Notably, up to 40% of GERD patients continue to experience symptoms despite PPI treatment. Both PPIs and P-CABs target H + /K + -ATPase to inhibit acid secretion. As an alternative to PPIs, P-CABs have demonstrated their ability to suppress acid production by competitively inhibiting the gastric H + /K + -ATPase through K + competition. They also offer a prolonged inhibition with a gradual dissociation from the H + /K + -ATPase, resulting in long-lasting effects. A clinical study with 24 patients with PPI-resistant RE reported a 87.5% success rate in treating esophageal mucosal breaks with 20 mg of VPZ. Furthermore, NAB is a common occurrence, even when PPIs are administered twice daily. NAB is observed in over 70% of Helicobacter pylori-negative patients undergoing PPI therapy. VPZ and TPZ have demonstrated more effective nighttime acid suppression compared to PPIs. Additionally, substantial variation in pharmacodynamic responses among individuals is primarily attributed to CYP2C19 genetic polymorphism, significantly influencing the pharmacokinetics. Research has demonstrated that individuals classified as poor metabolizers based on their CYP2C19 enzyme activity are more prevalent in Asian populations (8–20%) when compared to Caucasians (3–5%) and African Americans (3–5%). Unlike PPIs, VPZ and TPZ's efficacy in acid suppression is independent of the CYP2C19 phenotype. Finally, it is important to note that PPIs are susceptible to degradation in acidic conditions and typically require enteric coating. This leads to delayed absorption and onset of action. However, clinical studies have indicated that VPZ and TPZ can be administered without the need to consider food intake. VPZ and TPZ address certain unmet needs in PPIs and provide a new option for the clinical management of GERD.

### A randomized, double-blind study to evaluate the acid-inhibitory effect of vonoprazan (20 mg and 40 mg) in patients with proton-pump inhibitor-resistant erosive esophagitis [^112qLifd]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

The results of this study demonstrate that some patients with PPI-resistant EE derive clinical benefit from treatment with vonoprazan. This is especially important given the limited treatment options for patients with PPI-resistant EE; vonoprazan may be a viable treatment for this subset of patients with EE. Further clinical trials are needed to confirm these findings.

Vonoprazan was found to have a favorable safety and tolerability profile, which has also been observed in several other studies. In previous trials, vonoprazan was well tolerated, with most TEAEs being mild or moderate in intensity. Elevated levels of serum gastrin, pepsinogen I and pepsinogen II, resulting from vonoprazan treatment, have also been observed in previous studies.

In conclusion, vonoprazan at doses of 20 mg and 40 mg was found to effectively inhibit gastric acid secretion over a 24-hour period, both during the daytime and night-time, and resulted in the healing of EE in some patients who had failed previous treatment with a PPI. Vonoprazan had a favorable safety and tolerability profile and may be considered a viable treatment option for patients with EE that is resistant to PPIs.

### Pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of the potassium-competitive acid blocker vonoprazan and the proton pump inhibitor lansoprazole in US subjects [^1136uPaE]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

We assessed pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of a potassium-competitive acid blocker and proton pump inhibitor in US subjects.

Methods

Healthy adults were randomized to 7-day periods of vonoprazan 20 mg once daily followed by lansoprazole 30 mg once daily or the reverse order, separated by ≥ 7 days of washout.

Results

Vonoprazan (N = 40) had higher proportions of 24-hour periods with intragastric pH > 4 than lansoprazole (N = 41,38) on day 1 (62.4% vs 22.6%, P < 0.0001) and day 7 (87.8% vs 42.3%, P < 0.0001). Separation in pH started ∼2.5 hours after the first dose.

Discussion

Vonoprazan provided more rapid and potent inhibition of intragastric acidity than lansoprazole in US subjects.

### Phase III, randomised, double-blind, multicentre study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of vonoprazan compared with lansoprazole in Asian patients with erosive oesophagitis [^115Qm2tg]. Gut (2020). Medium credibility.

Vonoprazan and lansoprazole were similarly well tolerated in the populations studied. The incidences of TEAEs were similar between the treatment arms. Drug-related TEAEs occurred slightly more frequently with vonoprazan (36/244, 14.8%) than with lansoprazole (27/235, 11.5%) treatment. Of note, there were no new safety signals and no deaths were reported during the study.

The sensitivity of vonoprazan in ethnic variations had been examined by looking at effects on pharmacokinetics linearity, metabolism by hepatic cytochrome (CY)P450 enzymes, therapeutic index and drug accumulation with repetitive dosing. Although vonoprazan exhibits non-linear pharmacokinetic characteristics, the dose-normalised exposure (maximum concentration and area under the concentration-time curve) for Chinese and Japanese subjects is similar, indicating that the non-linearity does not contribute to potential differences in exposure. CYP2C19 phenotypes do not affect vonoprazan pharmacokinetic parameters, indicating that ethnic differences in phenotypical distribution of CYP2C19 are not expected to play a major role in contributing to metabolic differences among Chinese, Japanese and other ethnic populations. There is evidence that vonoprazan exhibits a wide therapeutic index; it has been demonstrated that a single dose of vonoprazan 120 mg was well tolerated. There is also evidence that multiple doses of 40 mg per day were well tolerated. Interaction of vonoprazan and clarithromycin, an inhibitor of CYP3A4, resulted in an almost twofold increase in oral bioavailability, but this was not associated with a significant alteration in efficacy and/or safetyas plasma concentrations remained within the therapeutic window. In addition, given that the dosing interval of vonoprazan is 24 hours and that the accumulation factor is two when the dosing interval is equal to the half-life, which is 9.4 hours, vonoprazan accumulation under CYP3A4 inhibition will be considerably lower than twofold. Taken together, this evidence suggests that vonoprazan may be insensitive to differences in ethnicity.

Conclusions

Based on this meta-analysis, vonoprazan is more effecative than PPIs are at reducing delayed postoperative bleeding from artificial ulcers after ESD, but there are no significant differences in ulcer healing, ulcer shrinkage rates, or ulcer perforation rates. Further analysis of additional trials is needed for the comparison of vonoprazan and PPIs in the treatment of artificial ulcers after ESD.

### Comparison of vonoprazan and proton pump inhibitors for the treatment of gastric endoscopic submucosal dissection-induced ulcer: an updated systematic review and meta-analysis [^1136KDB5]. BMC Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) has become the established treatment for early gastric cancer. Unfortunately, ESD can cause artificial ulceration, which is occasionally linked to delayed postoperative bleeding and even perforation. Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are generally prescribed after ESD to inhibit the secretion of gastric acid and to promote the healing of iatrogenic ulcers.

Recently, vonoprazan, a novel acid inhibitor, has been used after ESD. As an active potassium-competitive acid blocker (P-CAB), vonoprazan inhibits gastric acid secretion in a K+-competitive and reversible manner and reportedly has a more rapid, stronger and longer-lasting acid inhibitory effect than PPIs. Furthermore, vonoprazan is not affected by mealtimes or by CYP2C19 polymorphism. These findings indicate that vonoprazan may have a similar or better effect than PPIs have on the healing of ESD-induced ulcers.

Several studies and meta-analyses have been performed to compare the efficacy of vonoprazan and PPIs for treating post-ESD artificial ulcers. However, evidence-based medicine proving the efficacy of vonoprazan and PPIs is still lacking. Whether vonoprazan is superior to PPIs remains controversial. For example, the meta-analysis by Kang et al. showed no substantial difference in ulcer healing between vonoprazan and PPIs, while the meta-analysis by Liu et al. noted that vonoprazan had better efficacy in ulcer healing than did PPIs. Therefore, we conducted an updated systematic review and meta-analysis to compare the efficacy of vonoprazan and PPIs in treating ESD-induced artificial ulcers.

### Vonoprazan is efficacious for treatment of heartburn in non-erosive reflux disease: a randomized trial [^116WfSBP]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background & Aims

Potassium-competitive acid blockers have documented efficacy for erosive esophagitis. We performed a randomized trial in United States subjects diagnosed with non-erosive reflux disease of vonoprazan vs placebo for 4 weeks, followed by a 20-week active-treatment extension.

Methods

Adult subjects with heartburn ≥ 4 days/week during screening without erosive esophagitis on endoscopy were randomized to placebo, vonoprazan 10 mg, or vonoprazan 20 mg. After 4 weeks, subjects on placebo were re-randomized to vonoprazan 10 mg or 20 mg, and those already on vonoprazan continued at the same dose for 20 weeks. Electronic diaries were completed twice daily. The primary endpoint was percentage of days without daytime or nighttime heartburn (24-hour heartburn-free days).

Results

Among 772 randomized subjects, the percentage of 24-hour heartburn-free days was 27.7% for placebo vs 44.8% for vonoprazan 10 mg (least squares mean difference, 17.1%; P < .0001) and 44.4% for vonoprazan 20 mg (least squares mean difference, 16.7%; P < .0001). Differences in percentage of subjects with a 24-hour heartburn-free day for vonoprazan 10 mg vs placebo and vonoprazan 20 mg vs placebo were 8.3% and 11.6% on day 1 and 18.1% and 23.2% on day 2. The mean/median percentages of 24-hour heartburn-free days over the extension period were similar across the 4 study arms: 61%-63%/76%-79%.

Conclusions

Vonoprazan reduced heartburn symptoms in subjects diagnosed with non-erosive reflux disease, with the benefit appearing to begin as early as the first day of therapy. Treatment effect persisted after the initial 4-week placebo-controlled period throughout the 20-week extension period. The 2 vonoprazan doses (10 mg and 20 mg) were similar in efficacy.

This is the first study to demonstrate the non-inferior efficacy and safety of once-daily vonoprazan 20 mg to once-daily lansoprazole 30 mg with respect to healing EO at 8 weeks in Asian patients, predominantly from mainland China, and from Malaysia, South Korea and Taiwan (92.4% vs 91.3%, respectively; difference: 1.1% (95% CI –3.822% to 6.087%)). These findings are consistent with the results reported in a previous phase III study which demonstrated the non-inferiority of vonoprazan 20 mg to lansoprazole 30 mg with respect to healing EO at 8 weeks (99% vs 95.5%; difference: 3.5% (95% CI 0.362% to 6.732%)). Of note, there were differences in the 8-week EO healing rate reported by Ashida et al and the present study, which could be attributed to treatment compliance. Ashida et al reported a 98% treatment compliance rate, whereas in the present study 93% of Asian patients were treatment-compliant, which could have resulted in the lower EO healing rate reported in our findings. Although our findings differ from the aforementioned pivotal study in Japan, the healing rate with lansoprazole reported in this study was similar to those reported in China.

There was a rapid response to treatment with both the overall population and those with LA classification grade C/D demonstrating a healing rate of > 60% at 2 weeks with vonoprazan treatment. In the overall population, the EO healing rate at 2 weeks was numerically higher with vonoprazan than that observed with lansoprazole (75.0% vs 67.8%), which may be indicative of a more potent and faster clinical effect with vonoprazan than with lansoprazole treatment resulting from the rapid and strong suppression of gastric acid secretion. The results of a previous phase III study conducted in Japanreported higher healing rates with vonoprazan 20 mg and lansoprazole 30 mg treatment (90.7% vs 81.9%; difference: 8.8% (95% CI 2.105% to 15.448%)) at 2 weeks. As previously mentioned, the differences observed could be attributed to the differences in treatment compliance and the overall low EO healing rates in patients treated with PPIs among Asians, excluding Japanese patients.

### Randomised clinical trial: 3-year interim analysis results of the VISION trial to evaluate the long-term safety of vonoprazan as maintenance treatment in patients with erosive oesophagitis [^111yX8Hd]. BMC Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

For endoscopic findings other than hyperplastic polyps, fundic gland polyps were found in 72 (66.1%) patients in the vonoprazan group and 44 (77.2%) patients in the lansoprazole group at week 156; cobblestone mucosa in 16 (14.7%) and 5 (8.8%) patients, respectively; and multiple white flat elevated lesions in 7 (6.4%) and 9 (15.8%) patients, respectively. The incidence of gastric polypoid lesions increased with increasing duration of treatment. Fundic gland polyps were the most common type, but these were already present at entry to the maintenance phase in 43.7% of patients in the vonoprazan group and 43.3% in the lansoprazole group. The incidence of fundic polyps increases with the dose and duration of PPIs, and the results of this study are consistent with previous reports. No patients discontinued medication because of increased or enlarged gastric polyps, but one patient discontinued vonoprazan treatment at week 156 because of the presence of a foveolar-type adenoma. Recent studies have found that foveolar-type adenoma is a common type of gastric neoplastic lesion found in H. pylori- uninfected individuals. This type of lesion has been found both in individuals who have serum gastrin levels within the normal range and in PPI users who have elevated levels of serum gastrin, and the tumorigenic mechanisms that result in the development of this type of lesion in H. pylori -uninfected individuals are currently unclear.

There was no difference in overall TEAEs between the vonoprazan and lansoprazole groups, but the proportion of patients who discontinued medication because of an AE was greater in the vonoprazan group than in the lansoprazole group.

A limitation of the study is the possibility of a false negative urea breath test. Another limitation of this study is that, although the site and method of histopathological sample collection was defined in the study protocol and procedures manual together with reference images, sampling was up to the endoscopist at each institution and could therefore be variable. However, histopathological evaluation of gastric mucosa and histological evaluation of gastritis were undertaken centrally in a blinded manner by two expert pathologists specialising in gastrointestinal histopathology, who also instructed the principal investigator on the method of sample collection before the start of the study. In addition, if there was any difference in the histopathological evaluation between these two pathologists, evaluation was determined after separate consultation with two other pathologists.

### Phase III, randomised, double-blind, multicentre study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of vonoprazan compared with lansoprazole in Asian patients with erosive oesophagitis [^114TPzqG]. Gut (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

To establish the non-inferior efficacy of vonoprazan versus lansoprazole in the treatment of Asian patients with erosive oesophagitis (EO).

Design

In this phase III, double-blind, multicentre study, patients with endoscopically confirmed EO were randomised 1:1 to receive vonoprazan 20mg or lansoprazole 30mg, once daily for up to 8 weeks. The primary endpoint was EO healing rate at 8 weeks. The secondary endpoints were EO healing rates at 2 and 4 weeks. Safety endpoints included treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs).

Results

In the vonoprazan (n = 238) and lansoprazole (n = 230) arms, 8-week EO healing rates were 92.4% and 91.3%, respectively (difference 1.1% (95% CI -3.822% to 6.087%)). The respective 2-week EO healing rates were 75.0% and 67.8% (difference 7.2% (95% CI -1.054% to 15.371%)), and the respective 4-week EO healing rates were 85.3% and 83.5% (difference 1.8% (95% CI -4.763% to 8.395%)). In patients with baseline Los Angeles classification grade C/D, 2-week, 4-week and 8-week EO healing rates were higher with vonoprazan versus lansoprazole (2weeks: 62.2% vs 51.5%, difference 10.6% (95% CI -5.708% to 27.002%); 4weeks: 73.3% vs 67.2%, difference 6.2% (95% CI -8.884 to 21.223); and 8weeks: 84.0% vs 80.6%, difference 3.4% (95% CI -9.187% to 15.993%)). Overall, EO healing rates appeared higher with vonoprazan versus lansoprazole. TEAE rates were 38.1% and 36.6% in the vonoprazan and lansoprazole group, respectively.

Conclusion

Our findings demonstrate the non-inferior efficacy of vonoprazan versus lansoprazole in terms of EO healing rate at 8 weeks in this population. Safety outcomes were similar in the two treatment arms.

### Phase III, randomised, double-blind, multicentre study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of vonoprazan compared with lansoprazole in Asian patients with erosive oesophagitis [^117VryZ1]. Gut (2020). Medium credibility.

Vonoprazan 20 mg is the approved dose in Japan for the treatment of EO. However, the non-inferior efficacy and safety of vonoprazan 20 mg to lansoprazole 30 mg with respect to healing EO has not been demonstrated in Asian patients. This phase III study was conducted to meet the regulatory registration requirements in mainland China, South Korea and Taiwan. The primary objective of the study was to demonstrate the non-inferior efficacy of vonoprazan 20 mg to lansoprazole 30 mg at 8 weeks in Asian patients with EO. The secondary objectives were to demonstrate the non-inferior efficacy of vonoprazan 20 mg to lansoprazole 30 mg at 2 and 4 weeks, and to compare the safety of treatment with vonoprazan versus lansoprazole in this patient population.

Common AEs

Meta-analyses demonstrated that the incidences of increased serum gastrin (OR = 6.25, 95% CI = 4.08–9.59, p < 0.01) and pepsinogen I levels (OR = 3.49, 95% CI = 2.40–5.10, p < 0.01) were significantly higher in patients taking vonoprazan than those taking PPIs. There was no statistically significant heterogeneity (I 2 = 0%; p = 0.45 and I² = 0%; p = 0.66, respectively). The incidence of diarrhea was significantly lower in patients taking vonoprazan than those taking PPIs (OR = 0.73, 95% CI = 0.57–0.94, p = 0.32) with significant heterogeneity (I 2 = 57.7%; p < 0.01). The incidences of other common AEs were statistically similar between patients taking vonoprazan and PPIs (Figure 4).

### P-CABPPI in the eradication of: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^114b3DDb]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

This is the first study to make a comparison between P-CAB drugs. Although existing studies have shown that tegoprazan produces a more rapid, effective, and sustained acid suppression effect than vonoprazan, the results of this study suggest that vonoprazan-based regimens are superior to tegoprazan-based regimens in terms of eradication rate. Choi et al. reported the reasons why tegoprazan-based regimens had a lower eradication rate than expected, including inadequate dosing (tegoprazan, 50 mg bid), distribution differences in minimal inhibitory concentration between clarithromycin-resistant strains, pharmacological differences between vonoprazan and tegoprazan, and inadequate duration of treatment. Tegoprazan is a novel P-CAB based on benzimidazole structure and is highly selective for inhibition of the H + /K + ATPase enzyme. It is characterized by rapid absorption and the maximum concentration can be reached in 0.5–1.5 h. The half-life of tegoprazan is short, with an average half-life of 3.7–5.4 h, while the plasma half-life of vonoprazan is longer. In healthy adults, the average terminal half-life of vonoprazan is 7.7 h, and this may be one of the reasons why the eradication rate of vonoprazan is better than that of tegoprazan. Due to the lack of relevant evidence, large RCT studies need to be carried out in the future to compare the efficacy and safety of vonoprazan and tegoprazan in eradicating Hp.

### ACG clinical guideline: treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection [^113GnRe8]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Helicobacter pylori — vonoprazan–amoxicillin regimens show efficacy and tolerability: In clarithromycin-resistant strains, vonoprazan-amoxicillin dual therapy outperformed lansoprazole-clarithromycin triple therapy (70% vs 32%), and in the overall modified intention-to-treat population eradication rates were 77% vs 69%, with comparable safety and low discontinuations; in China, 10-day vonoprazan 20 mg twice daily plus amoxicillin either 750 mg 4 times daily (3 g/day) or 1,000 mg twice daily (2 g/day) found the higher amoxicillin dose noninferior to bismuth quadruple and with significantly fewer adverse events, and another RCT showed vonoprazan 20 mg twice daily plus amoxicillin 1,000 mg 3 times daily for 10 days was noninferior to a 14-day bismuth-based quadruple regimen containing amoxicillin rather than metronidazole and had significantly lower adverse event rates including gastrointestinal disturbance and diarrhea.

Efficacy

Following 8 weeks of treatment with vonoprazan, endoscopic assessment (excluding patients for whom baseline EE was classified as grade 0 by the CAC, which was not originally planned) showed that 3/5 patients in the 20 mg group and 5/7 patients in the 40 mg group had confirmed EE healing, resulting in EE healing rates of 60.0% and 71.4%, respectively (Table 3). The highest healing rate was observed for patients with EE graded as A/B at baseline (as assessed by the CAC) who were treated with 40 mg of vonoprazan; this group had a healing rate of 80% (4/5 patients). Patients with EE graded as A/B (as assessed by the CAC) treated with 20 mg of vonoprazan and all patients with EE graded as C/D (as assessed by the CAC) had similar healing rates (50.0–66.7%), irrespective of dose (Table 3).

### AGA clinical practice update on integrating potassium-competitive acid blockers into clinical practice: expert review [^112EHbGe]. Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Bleeding peptic ulcer — Best Practice Advice 9 states that although there is currently insufficient evidence for clinicians to use P-CABs as first-line therapy in patients with bleeding gastroduodenal ulcers and high-risk stigmata, their rapid and potent acid inhibition raises the possibility of their utility. After endoscopic hemostasis for high-risk stigmata ulcer bleeding, 194 patients across 6 centers in Thailand were randomized to oral vonoprazan 20 mg twice daily for 3 days then 20 mg once daily for 28 days versus high-dose PPI with pantoprazole intravenous infusion 8 mg/h for 3 days then omeprazole 20 mg twice daily for 28 days; the vonoprazan regimen was noninferior to PPI for rebleeding at 3 days, 7 days, and 30 days (7.1% vs 10.4%, risk difference, 3.3%; 95% CI, −11.2% to 4.7%). Higher doses of P-CABs for short periods, for prophylaxis against high-risk upper GI ulcer rebleeding, warrant further study.

### The role of vonoprazan in patients with erosive esophagitis [^1112VVmj]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

The first randomized, double-blind, multicenter study evaluating the efficacy of vonoprazan in patients with PPI-resistant EE was reported in 2017. A total of 19 patients, who had EE despite previous PPIs therapy were randomly assigned to the vonoprazan 20 mg and 40 mg arm. It was showed that both dosage of vonoprazan could inhibit gastric acid secretion over a 24-h period with a significant increase in gastric pH 4 HTR, and could completely heal mucosal erosions at 8 weeks in more than 60% of PPI-resistant EE patients. Hoshino S et al performed a prospective study among 24 patients with PPI-resistant EE. The study consisted of a 4-week initial treatment phase of vonoprazan 20 mg followed by an 8-week maintenance phase of vonoprazan 10 mg for those who healed EE after the initial phase. It was found that esophageal mucosal breaks were treated successfully in 21 (87.5%) out of 24 patients, and the frequency scale for symptoms of GERD (FSSG) score was also significantly relieved at 4 weeks after the initial phase. Moreover, the mucosal healing was maintained in 16 (76.2%) out of 21 patients during the second phase of the study. To investigate the efficacy of long-term maintenance therapy with vonoprazan for PPI-resistant EE, the same team subsequently conducted a 52-week maintenance study with 10 mg vonoprazan among 16 patients with PPI-resistant EE who achieved remission from the above preceding study. They found that endoscopic remission was maintained at 52 weeks in 93.8% of patients with PPI-resistant EE. No significant change of the FSSG score was observed at 52 weeks, indicating the symptom relief also maintained. Similar results were also found in other trials – (Table 4). Therefore, vonoprazan may exhibit a potential role for fulfilling the unmet need in terms of treating PPI-resistant EE. However, all of these trials were lack of a placebo or active control arm and with a small sample size. Large-scale, well-designed randomized controlled trials (with a placebo or active control arm) are necessary to verify the role of vonoprazan for patients with PPI-resistant EE.

### Crystal structures of the gastric proton pump [^113n4e4k]. Nature (2018). Excellent credibility.

The gastric proton pump-the H +, K + -ATPase-is a P-type ATPase responsible for acidifying the gastric juice down to pH 1. This corresponds to a million-fold proton gradient across the membrane of the parietal cell, the steepest known cation gradient of any mammalian tissue. The H +, K + -ATPase is an important target for drugs that treat gastric acid-related diseases. Here we present crystal structures of the H +, K + -ATPase in complex with two blockers, vonoprazan and SCH28080, in the luminal-open state, at 2.8Å resolution. The drugs have partially overlapping but clearly distinct binding modes in the middle of a conduit running from the gastric lumen to the cation-binding site. The crystal structures suggest that the tight configuration at the cation-binding site lowers the pK a value of Glu820 sufficiently to enable the release of a proton even into the pH 1 environment of the stomach.

### Comparative efficacy and safety of vonoprazan versus esomeprazole-based high-dose dual therapies for first-lineeradication: a randomized controlled trial [^1124fWih]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Effective Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) eradication depends on maintaining intragastric pH > 6 and overcoming antibiotic resistance. High-dose dual therapy (HDDT) with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) and amoxicillin has shown promising results.

Objectives

To compare the efficacy of 14-day vonoprazan-based (VA) and esomeprazole-based (EA) HDDT for H. pylori eradication and evaluate the impact of antibiotic resistance.

Design

Randomized controlled trial (RCT).

Methods

A total of 121 patients with confirmed H. pylori infection were randomized to receive either VA therapy (vonoprazan 20mg twice daily plus amoxicillin 750mg four times daily (QID)) or EA therapy (esomeprazole 40mg three times daily plus amoxicillin 750mg QID) for 14days. Eradication was assessed by the ¹³C-urea breath test at week 8. Antibiotic susceptibility testing was performed on cultured isolates.

Results

Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics were comparable between the VA and EA groups. In the intention-to-treat analysis, eradication rates were 86.9% (95% confidence interval (CI): 78.4%-95.4%) in the VA group and 81.7% (95% CI: 71.3%-89.4%) in the EA group (p = 0.430). Per-protocol (PP) analysis showed eradication rates of 93.0% (95% CI: 86.4%-99.6%) for VA and 84.5% (95% CI: 73.8%-92.1%) for EA (p = 0.150), indicating no statistically significant difference. Adverse events (AEs) were mild and similar between groups (5.3% in VA vs 5.2% in EA, p = 0.983), with constipation and diarrhea being the most reported. Both groups achieved 100% compliance. Antibiotic resistance patterns did not significantly affect outcomes.

Conclusion

Both VA and EA-HDDT regimens demonstrated comparable efficacy, excellent compliance, and minimal AEs. Although VA therapy achieved a > 90% eradication rate in the PP analysis, our study was underpowered to confirm superiority. Therefore, larger, adequately powered RCTs are warranted to validate the potential superiority of VA.

### Vonoprazan fumarate, a novel potassium-competitive acid blocker, in the management of gastroesophageal reflux disease: safety and clinical evidence to date [^113dSzyQ]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Introduction of more potent, long-acting vonoprazan into clinical use would fulfill at least a part, if not all, of unmet needs of GERD management. For instance, it has a potential to overcome the problem of nocturnal acid breakthrough because acid suppression with a single high dose of vonoprazan or two divided regular doses could cover the night period in the majority of healthy patients. Moreover, efficacy of vonoprazan for patients having a more severe grade of esophagitis in the phase III clinical trial in Japan and for PPI-refractory cases was documented in a small case series, again indicating a promise for fulfilling one of the unmet needs for GERD therapy.– Further large-scale, prospective, randomized controlled studies with PPI as a comparator, however, are imperative to verify this potential. For maintaining healing, vonoprazan, even in a low dose showed an excellent result. We need to explore which of the strategies, vonoprazan first and stepped down to PPI; PPI first and stepped up to vonoprazan; or continuous vonoprazan with dose reduction after healing, would be more advantageous in terms of patient satisfaction, required cost and long-term safety concerns associated with hypergastrinemia and hypochlorhydria.

Another unmet need with conventional PPIs has been a rather poor symptomatic control in patients with NERD. Unfortunately, very few data are available with vonoprazan, requiring further evidence in this aspect of managing GERD.

Of course, we need to carefully watch the long-term safety of vonoprazan, including the development of gastric neuroendocrine tumors, influence on nutrient deficiency, increase in infection, and alteration of gut microbiota among others.

For the moment, vonoprazan is available only in Japan, but an international trial of comparing vonoprazan with lansoprazole in patients with erosive reflux disease in Asia, including China, Korea, Taiwan and Malaysia is underway. It is expected that it would be launched for use for GERD patients in some of the Asian countries in 2018. Considering highly efficient eradication results with vonoprazan-based triple therapy for Helicobacter pylori, further expanded license for this indication is expected, as the disease burden associated with this infection, such as gastric cancer, is high in this part of the world. A phase II clinical trial of vonoprazan in Europe has been initiated and that of the United States is under consideration, where the demand for better therapy for GERD patients is high. Thus, vonoprazan might have a potential to play a pivotal role in the management of GERD internationally in the future.

### Vonoprazan fumarate, a novel potassium-competitive acid blocker, in the management of gastroesophageal reflux disease: safety and clinical evidence to date [^111L4Eru]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Vonoprazan fumarate, a potassium-competitive acid blocker with proven track records for gastroesophageal reflux disease

Vonoprazan fumarate has a different chemical structure defined as a pyrrole derivative which is different from previous P-CABs such as SCH 28080 and AZD0865 that have benzimidazole ring or revaprazan having pyrimidine ring(Figure 1). Another notable difference from previous P-CABs is that vonoprazan has alkaline pKa of 9.06, which enabled its high level of accumulation in acid space such as intracellular canaliculi of the parietal cells. In animal experiments, vonoprazan highly accumulated in the gastric gland both in the resting and in the active state; remarkably, the ratio of accumulation in the resting gastric gland was higher than that in the actively secreting gastric gland, as compared with lansoprazole. The accumulation of vonoprazan in the resting gland might account for its rapid onset of action although further experiments are necessary to examine whether vonoprazan can accumulate in the tubulovesicles in the resting parietal cells, and inactivate H +, K + -ATPase. Furthermore, vonoprazan selectively accumulated in the gastric corpus mucosa, particularly in parietal cells as shown in an autoradiography study, verifying specific targeting of this drug. It is rapidly absorbed and reaches to the maximum plasma level (Cmax) within 2 h but the plasma half-life (t 1/2) was much longer (t 1/2: about 7 h with 20 mg of vonoprazan taken on fasting) than conventional PPIs having much shorter half-lives (t 1/2 = 1–2 h), as shown in the pharmacokinetic profile – (Table 2, Figure 2), enabling once-daily dose for clinical use. As it does not require acid-catalyzed activation, similar efficacy of acid suppression with vonoprazan was shown irrespective of the administration before or after breakfast, (Figure 2). Most importantly, vonoprazan exhibited potent, long-lasting acid suppression starting from the first day of administration which was dose-dependent and further increase in 7 days. At 40 mg, vonoprazan achieved almost total achlorhydria in both Japanese and UK patients(Table 1, Figure 3). Thus, the acid suppression with vonoprazan was much quicker and more profound than conventional PPIs and this effect started from the first day of administration. Even at 7 days, when PPIs achieve steady-state acid suppression, vonoprazan showed superiority to esomeprazole (20 mg) or rabeprazole (10 mg)(Figure 4) in terms of the 24 h pH > 4 holding time.

### Study for every other day administration of vonoprazan in maintenance treatment of erosive GERD: study protocol for a multicentre randomised cross-over study [^115P5HY2]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2018). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The first drug selected for treatment of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and prevention of the recurrence is a proton pump inhibitor (PPI), but recently, a potassium-competitive acid blocker (P-CAB) was put on the market in Japan. Its onset of effect is faster than PPI, and it takes more than 2 days to recover acid secretion after the withdrawal period. Therefore, unlike PPI, the usefulness of every other day administration or discontinuous administration is expected.

Methods and Analysis

This study is a prospective, multicentre, open-label, two-period randomised cross-over study to compare the efficacy and safety of PPI every other day administration and P-CAB every other day administration in 120 patients who receive erosive GERD maintenance therapy with PPI. Patients will be randomly allocated to receive 4 weeks P-CAB or PPI followed by 4 weeks cross over, where those on P-CAB will receive PPI and vice versa. The primary endpoint is proportion of asymptomatic patients. Secondary endpoints are suppressive effect of GERD symptoms, proportion of asymptomatic patients at each time point, safety and cost-saving effect of P-CAB every other day administration, compliance with every other day administration, and proportion of asymptomatic patients at the first month of study drug administration.

Ethics and Dissemination

This study was approved by the National Hospital Organization Central Review Board for Clinical Trials (5 December 2017).

Discussion

If P-CAB every other day administration is established as one of GERD maintenance therapies, there is merit in both medical cost reduction and the safety to alleviate elevation in serum gastrin.

### Network meta-analysis comparing vonoprazan and proton pump inhibitors for heartburn symptoms in erosive esophagitis [^1118j3MM]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Goals

This systematic review and network meta-analysis aimed to assess the relative efficacy of vonoprazan and proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) on early heartburn symptom resolution in patients with erosive esophagitis.

Background

Limited available data directly compare the efficacy of vonoprazan, a first-in-class potassium-competitive acid blocker, with PPIs in erosive esophagitis.

Study

We conducted a systematic literature review (in MEDLINE and CENTRAL) and subsequent network meta-analysis according to Cochrane and PRISMA guidelines. Double-blind, randomized controlled trials in adults with erosive esophagitis treated with vonoprazan or a PPI were included in the analysis. Primary outcomes were heartburn symptom resolution rate on Day 1 and Day 7. The study was performed with all available data, using a random effects model within a Bayesian framework.

Results

Overall, 10 randomized controlled trials were included in the network meta-analysis. For heartburn resolution rate on Day 1 (9 of 10 trials), vonoprazan 20mg once daily (QD) was superior to placebo (median odds ratio = 16.75, 95% credible interval: 2.16–207.80). Point estimates numerically favored vonoprazan 20mg QD over other comparators. For heartburn resolution rate on Day 7 (10 of 10 trials), vonoprazan 20mg QD was superior to placebo and other comparators except rabeprazole 20mg QD. Point estimates numerically favored vonoprazan 20mg QD over rabeprazole 20mg QD.

Conclusions

In this study, vonoprazan 20mg QD was equally effective in heartburn resolution on Day 1, and equally or more effective on Day 7 versus PPIs in adults with erosive esophagitis.

### Study for every other day administration of vonoprazan in maintenance treatment of erosive GERD: study protocol for a multicentre randomised cross-over study [^117FGa45]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2018). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a condition that caused symptoms such as heartburn and acid regurgitation due to backflow of stomach contents, and the prevalence rate of GERD has dramatically increased in Japan. The first drug for GERD treatment and prevention of the recurrence is a proton pump inhibitor (PPI). Recently, potassium-competitive acid blocker (P-CAB) which exerts stronger and more stable acid suppressive effect than PPI was put on the market in Japan. Owing to its pharmacological action, unlike PPI, P-CAB shows the maximum acid suppressive effect immediately after administration, and it has the characteristic that the acid suppressive effect lasts for a few days after discontinuation of the administration. Therefore, a single administration of P-CAB showed significant acid suppressive effect compared with double-dose administration of PPI, and its efficacy against PPI-resistant GERD has been confirmed. Since the incidence of relapse becomes high after the initial treatment of GERD, maintenance therapy with PPI is required to prevent recurrence. As maintenance therapy of GERD, there are continuous administration, intermittent administration, and discontinuous (on demand) administration of PPI. Also in GERD clinical practice guideline 2015, maintenance therapy for mild reflux esophagitis which accounts for 90% of the total of GERD recommends step-down therapy to reduce the dose to the minimum if symptom control is possible. If symptoms are suppressed by daily administration, it is common to take half-dose administration or every other day administration or intermittent therapy as the next step. From the pharmacological characteristics of P-CAB, it is presumed that there is no significant difference in acid suppressive effect between daily administration and every other day administration of P-CAB. On the other hand, since PPI has a slow onset of effect and maximum acid suppression is achieved on the 4–5 days after daily administration, it is considered that acid suppressive effect cannot be sufficiently obtained by PPI every other day administration.

For easily relapsing GERD in which recurrence of symptoms easily occurs due to discontinuation of PPI administration, it is difficult to transfer from continuous administration of PPI as GERD maintenance therapy to dosage reduction, intermittent administration, or discontinuous administration as step-down therapy. P-CAB every other day administration can be expected for such cases also.

There have been no studies showing the usefulness of PPI and P-CAB every other day in the maintenance therapy of GERD, and in the studies comparing P-CAB and PPI in maintenance therapy, there are only results of clinical trials for new drug applications.

### Phase III, randomised, double-blind, multicentre study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of vonoprazan compared with lansoprazole in Asian patients with erosive oesophagitis [^117NrKDT]. Gut (2020). Medium credibility.

Participants

Eligible patients had endoscopically confirmed EO (LA classification grades A–D) within 14 days of randomisation (treated as outpatients or temporarily admitted) and aged ≥ 18 years. Key exclusion criteria were prior exposure to vonoprazan or lansoprazole within 84 days of the observation phase, or exposure to vonoprazan at any time in a previous clinical trial or as a therapeutic agent; hypersensitivity or allergy to vonoprazan, its excipients or to PPIs; significant history of central nervous system, cardiovascular, pulmonary, hepatic, renal, metabolic, GI, urological, endocrine or haematological disease; presence of comorbidities or medical or surgical history that could affect the oesophagus; acute upper GI bleeding or gastric or duodenal ulcer within 30 days of the observation phase; history of or treatment for malignancy within 5 years of visit 1; and creatinine > 2 mg/dL (> 177 μmol/L), or alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or total bilirubin greater than the upper limit of normal at the start of the observation phase.

Study endpoints and assessments

The primary efficacy endpoint was EO healing rate at 8 weeks. The secondary efficacy endpoints were EO healing rates at 2 and 4 weeks of treatment. Endoscopy was performed at the start of the screening period and at weeks 2, 4 and 8 (or on early termination) under fasted conditions and classified in terms of LA classification grades (A–D or no mucosal breaks (grade O)). EO healing was defined as 'no mucosal breaks'. During the 8-week treatment period, healed EO was confirmed from any endoscopy test performed at visit 3, 4 or 6. During the 2-week treatment period, healed EO was confirmed at visit 3 and during the 4-week treatment period at visit 3 or 4.

Additional efficacy endpoints included the subjective symptoms of EO as recorded in patient diaries (eg, heart burn, gastric acid regurgitation), HRQoL over 8 weeks and the percentage of days without rescue medication during treatment. Safety endpoints included adverse events (AEs), laboratory test values, ECG, vital signs, serum gastrin values and pepsinogen I/II values. AEs and treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities V.18.0.

### Efficacy and safety comparison oferadication between vonoprazan dual therapytriple therapy: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113KQ1mP]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

As a novel drug, vonoprazan (VPZ) has been developed as a new strategy against Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infections. However, whether VPZ+amoxicillin (AMO) dual therapy has a clear advantage is still unclear.

Objective

To review and meta-analyze the available literature investigating the efficacy and safety of H. pylori eradication in VPZ dual therapy.

Design

A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted.

Data Sources and Methods

We performed a systematic search in the PubMed, Embase, EIsevier/Science Library, and Cochrane Library databases from 2015 to 2022. Meta-analyses were conducted to evaluate the actual cure rate and the incidence rate of adverse reactions in dual therapy and VPZ+AMO+clarithromycin (CLA) triple therapy; furthermore, eradication rates in CLA-resistant infections and different doses of antibiotics were evaluated in subgroup analysis.

Results

Seven studies with 1490 patients were included in this meta-analysis. According to intention-to-treat analysis, the actual cure rates of VPZ dual and triple therapy were 82.8% and 84.6%, respectively [p = 0.29, odds ratio (OR): 0.86, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.64–1.14]. And in the per-protocol analysis, the actual cure rates of these two therapies were 84.8% and 87.0%, respectively (p = 0.21, OR: 0.80, 95% CI: 0.57–1.13). The incidence of adverse reactions between VPZ dual and triple therapy was 26.1% versus 29.6% (p = 0.04, OR: 0.78, 95% CI: 0.61–0.99). In subgroup analysis, the eradication rates in CLA-resistant infections were dual therapy: 85.7% for VPZ versus 71.0% for triple therapy (p = 0.03, OR: 2.36, 95% CI: 1.10–5.05). And the actual cure rate of VPZ with high-dose antibiotics was lower than with low-dose antibiotics (p = 0.000 in dual therapy; p = 0.011 in triple therapy).

Conclusion

A combination of VPZ and a low dose of AMO should be prioritized as a treatment option for H. pylori eradication.

### Randomised clinical trial: 3-year interim analysis results of the VISION trial to evaluate the long-term safety of vonoprazan as maintenance treatment in patients with erosive oesophagitis [^111JTBPw]. BMC Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Both the vonoprazan and lansoprazole groups showed increases in serum pepsinogen I and II over time. In particular, the increase was higher in the vonoprazan group. Pepsinogens I and II are secreted by the chief cells and mucous neck cells. It has been indicated that receptors for gastrin exist in the chief cells; therefore, it is likely that hypergastrinaemia caused by gastric acid secretion inhibitors resulted in increased serum pepsinogen I and II levels. Although hypergastrinaemia has been implicated in the development of gastric hyperplastic polyps, the prevalence of gastric hyperplastic polyps was 3.7% in the vonoprazan group vs 0% in the lansoprazole group at study entry, 7.3% vs 6.5% at week 48, 11.3% vs 10.0% at week 108, and 14.7% vs 15.8% at week 156. Despite this increased prevalence in both groups compared with the start of the healing phase, there were no cases where treatment was terminated because of an increase in the number or growth of hyperplastic polyps.

### Incidence and type of adverse events in patients taking vonoprazan: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115Ryxj3]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Drug-related AEs

Thirty-one studies explored the incidence of drug-related AEs in patients taking vonoprazan (Figure 2(b)). Meta-analysis demonstrated that the pooled incidence of drug-related AEs was 7% (95% CI = 5–9%) with significant heterogeneity (I 2 = 88.8%; p < 0.01). Meta-regression analyses did not find any source of heterogeneity. No significant publication bias was detected (p = 0.987).

In subgroup analyses, the pooled incidence of drug-related AEs was 10, 5, 7, and 0% in patients taking vonoprazan for the management of H. pylori infection, GERD, PUD, and artificial ulcers after gastric ESD, respectively (p interaction < 0.01); 7 and 9% in those for short-term healing of EE and long-term maintenance of healed EE, respectively (p interaction = 0.44); 4 and 17% in those for short-term healing of PUD and long-term secondary prevention of PUD, respectively (p interaction = 0.01); 7 and 6% in those for a duration of > 8 weeks and ≤ 8 weeks, respectively (p interaction = 0.87); and 7 and 7% in adult and adolescent patients taking vonoprazan, respectively (p interaction = 0.83) (Figure 2(b)).

### Vonoprazan fumarate, a novel potassium-competitive acid blocker, in the management of gastroesophageal reflux disease: safety and clinical evidence to date [^113EGUpR]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

VPZ, vonoprazan; EPZ, esomeprazole; RPZ, rabeprazole; HTR, holding time rate.

Other investigators also demonstrated that gastric acid suppression with vonoprazan 20 mg given either as once or twice per day was superior to esomeprazole 20 mg given either as once or twice per day irrespective of CYP2C19 status. One of the unmet needs, NAB, therefore, can be controlled by vonoprazan because pH > 4 holding time in the night time was about 75%, and over 90% with a single morning dose of 20 mg and 40 mg, respectively, and almost 100% when 20 mg was given in two divided doses.

Vonoprazan is mainly metabolized in the liver via CYP3A4 of cytochrome P450, (Figure 5), which is distinct from PPIs whose metabolisms are mostly through CYP2C19 pathway. Interference of the metabolism of vonoprazan with clarithromycin, a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4, supports that the major metabolic disposition pathway of vonoprazan occurs through CYP3A4 in humans. Since CYP2C19 status has clinically relevant differences between individuals with extensive metabolizer phenotype versus poor metabolism in terms of the efficacy of PPIs and also influences drug activation process via CYP2C19 such as thienopyridines. Since thienopyridines are often used together with PPIs, this raised a serious concern, as the antiplatelet effect of thienopyridines, if compromised, can lead to grave outcomes, which prompted the US Food and Drug Administration to issue a warning. Metabolic disposition of vonoprazan, less dependent on CYP2C19, provides smaller interindividual variations in the efficacy and less drug interactions through this pathway. However, drugs metabolized through the CYP3A4 pathway can interfere with the metabolism, and conversely, vonoprazan can affect the drugs metabolized through this pathway requiring attention.

Figure 5.
Metabolic disposition pathways of vonoprazan.

The major route of metabolic disposition of vonoprazan was reported via CYP3A4, which converts vonoprazan to compounds M-I and M-III (thick arrows). Although CYP2D6, CYP2C9 and CYP2C19, and sulfotransferase2A1 (SULT2A1) also participate in metabolic disposition, their roles are relatively minor. M-I-G * and M-II-G * were inferred glucuronic-acid-conjugated (G) products from M-I, and M-II, respectively. Data are taken from the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency of Japanwith some modifications.

### Vonoprazan fumarate, a novel potassium-competitive acid blocker, in the management of gastroesophageal reflux disease: safety and clinical evidence to date [^117UY9Pu]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Safety of vonoprazan

Throughout the course of clinical development, safety of vonoprazan has been surveyed, with particular attention to liver toxicity, as this has been a problem with previous P-CABs. Overall, no serious drug-related treatment-emerged adverse events (TEAEs) were noticed during the clinical trials, including those for GERD. In the abovementioned phase III trial, the safety profile of vonoprazan in the maintenance phase up to 52 weeks was similar to that of lansoprazole. It should be noted that the rate of abnormality in liver function tests in groups assigned to vonoprazan were similar to that of lansoprazole during the 8 weeks. No increase in liver toxicity was noticed during the long-term phase of the study in either group of vonoprazan, 10 or 20 mg.

### ACG clinical guideline: treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection [^116aDG31]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

ACG clinical guideline — Recommendation 4: In treatment-naive patients with Helicobacter pylori infection and unknown clarithromycin susceptibility, PCAB-clarithromycin triple therapy is suggested over PPI-clarithromycin triple therapy (conditional recommendation; moderate quality evidence). We advise against the use of clarithromycin in any treatment regimen unless there is evidence that a patient is infected with a clarithromycin-sensitive strain of H. pylori; if susceptibility is not known and there is no history of macrolide use and no alternative first-line therapy is available, evidence supports a 14-day, twice-daily triple regimen that includes clarithromycin and amoxicillin with a potassium-competitive acid blocker (PCAB) instead of a proton pump inhibitor (PPI). In prespecified analyses, vonoprazan-clarithromycin triple therapy was superior among clarithromycin-resistant strains (eradication rates by mITT 66% vs 32%, P < 0.0001) and in the entire study population (mITT 81% vs 69%, P < 0.0003); diarrhea (4%) and dysgeusia (4%) were the most commonly reported adverse events. A network meta-analysis reported vonoprazan-based triple therapy had 72% probability of being the most efficacious.

### Incidence and type of adverse events in patients taking vonoprazan: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^117T3Cxb]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Due to the lack of relevant data, we were not able to directly analyze the risk factors affecting the safety of vonoprazan. However, we performed subgroup analyses to evaluate the incidence of AEs in patients taking vonoprazan according to various conditions. First, patients with PUD had higher incidences of any AEs, serious AEs, and AEs leading to drug discontinuation than those with GERD, H. pylori infection, and artificial ulcer after gastric ESD. This might be because PUD is more complex and severe than other disease conditions, and requires a longer duration of vonoprazan. Specifically, we included both studies regarding short-term healing of PUD and long-term secondary prevention of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or aspirin-induced PUD into the same subgroup. In short-term healing of PUD studies, some patients with PUD had concomitant H. pylori infection which needs to be eradicated by vonoprazan combined with other drugs. In long-term secondary prevention of PUD studies, patients required a longer duration of vonoprazan. Second, patients with H. pylori infection had a higher incidence of drug-related AEs than those with PUD, GERD, and artificial ulcer after gastric ESD. This was mainly because multiple drugs, including antibiotics, bismuth, and probiotics, should be added along with vonoprazan for H. pylori eradication. Third, it is readily understood that the incidence of AEs was higher in patients taking long-term (> 8 weeks) use of vonoprazan than those taking short-term (≤ 8 weeks) use of vonoprazan. This finding was also observed in patients taking vonoprazan for the management of EE and PUD. Fourth, the race of the population taking vonoprazan (i.e. Asian and non-Asian) might not influence the risk of AEs. Recently, a population pharmacokinetic model evaluated the impact of the population from Asia and Europe on vonoprazan exposure, and also showed that the population effect on vonoprazan exposure was limited. Fifth, the incidence of AEs also seemed to be similar between adult and adolescent patients taking vonoprazan, which suggested that vonoprazan can be safe and well tolerated in both adults and adolescents. However, this finding required further validation in adolescents.

### Vonoprazan fumarate, a novel potassium-competitive acid blocker, in the management of gastroesophageal reflux disease: safety and clinical evidence to date [^113s3cEv]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Figure 1.
Chemical structure of potassium-competitive acid blockers.

Currently, only two P-CABs, revaprazan and vonoprazan, are marketed.

P-CAB, potassium-competitive acid blocker.

Among drugs categorized in P-CABs, the first P-CAB used in clinical practice was revaprazan (YH1885, Revanex®) (Figure 1), which was first marketed in South Korea. In common with previous P-CABs, it showed a rapid onset of action. However, the acid suppression with revaprazan was not superior to conventional PPIs, as the mean intragastric pH was pH 3.3 and 3.9 on the first and the seventh day, respectively, in healthy male volunteers given 200 mg of revaprazan. Furthermore, the pH > 4 holding time of the dose of revaprazan (200 mg) chosen for clinical use was < 12 h, which was similar or even inferior to the value reported in conventional PPIs(Table 1). Indeed, the efficacy of healing of ulcers after endoscopic submucosal dissection with revaprazan was similar to 20 mg of rabeprazole. No publication was found for GERD treatment with revaprazan by PubMed search. Considering that the pH > 4 holding time is an important predictor of healing erosive esophagitis, it may be presumed that the advantage of using revaprazan over PPI would be small, if any. Indeed, revaprazan has not yet been approved for GERD therapy from the regulatory authority (see Acknowledgments).

Table 1.
pH > 4 holding time (%) with proton-pump inhibitors and potassium-competitive acid blockers.

The second P-CAB introduced in actual clinical use is vonoprazan fumarate (TAK-438), which was marketed in Japan in early 2015 and has gained popularity because of its superior properties to conventional PPIs in terms of rapid onset of action, longer duration of action, consistent acid suppression irrespective of CYP2C19, and, most importantly, more potent acid suppression.

Currently, a phase III clinical trial [ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03006874] for reflux esophagitis is conducted in Korea to compare the safety and efficacy of new P-CAB, tegoprazan (RQ-00000004/CJ-12420) 50 and 100 mg with 40 mg of esomeprazole, the details of which are yet to be published.

Effect of vonoprazan for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)

A phase II clinical trial comparing various doses (5–40 mg once per day) of vonoprazan with lansoprazole (30 mg once per day) showed excellent therapeutic effect on erosive esophagitis, reflecting longer 24 h gastric pH > 4 holding time with vonoprazan. Remarkably, 20 and 40 mg of vonoprazan almost completely healed erosions in patients with high grades of erosive esophagitis (LA-C/D) in 4 weeks, whereas healing rate in LA-C/D esophagitis with lansoprazole at 4 weeks was 87%. No serious adverse events were observed in this trial, even with the highest tested dose of vonoprazan (40 mg). Based on the phase II results, the pivotal randomized controlled phase III trial comparing daily dose of 20 mg of vonoprazan with lansoprazole 30 mg for 8 weeks was conducted. This trial was designed to demonstrate the noninferiority of vonoprazan against lansoprazole 30 mg in healing erosive esophagitis as a required step for getting insurance approval from the regulatory authority. Another purpose of this trial was to study a long-term safety and efficacy of vonoprazan. Patients who were healed by 8 weeks of both arms (vonoprazan and lansoprazole) of therapy were assigned to a maintenance dose of either 10 or 20 mg of vonoprazan and followed up for up to 52 weeks. The first phase of this trial looking at healing rate of erosive esophagitis as the primary outcome recapitulated the results of the phase II trial. Overall healing rate at 8 weeks with 20 mg of vonoprazan and 30 mg of lansoprazole was 99.0% and 95.5%, respectively, thus noninferiority of vonoprazan against lansoprazole was verified. Actually, post hoc analysis showed that vonoprazan was significantly better in healing erosive esophagitis than lansoprazole. In a subgroup analysis, vonoprazan scored a significantly higher healing rate (98.7% at 8 weeks) as compared with lansoprazole 30 mg (87.5% at 8 weeks) in those with severe esophagitis (LA-C/D) (Figure 6). In the latter part of this trial studying a long-term efficacy and safety of maintenance dose of vonoprazan 10 or 20 mg per day, recurrence rates at 52 weeks with either dose of vonoprazan were similar and < 10% (Table 3). Another trial comparing efficacy of lansoprazole 15 mg, the dose approved for maintenance therapy for GERD in Japan, versus vonoprazan 10 and 20 mg to prevent recurrence of erosive esophagitis for 24 weeks, was conducted. Although the results of this trial have not been published yet, either dose of vonoprazan was clearly superior to lansoprazole 15 mg in preventing recurrence of esophagitis according to the government report(Table 3). Based on these two trials, 10 mg of vonoprazan was approved for maintenance therapy to prevent recurrence of erosive reflux disease in Japan. In case of failure with this dose, however, 20 mg of vonoprazan can be used for maintenance. In previous reports, clinical data on maintaining healing of esophagitis with lansoprazole 15 mg, or esomeprazole 10 mg were published. Considering similarity with the clinical trial data comparing vonoprazan with lansoprazoleand the similarity with independent PPI data, vonoprazan 10 mg seemed to show better preventive effect in maintaining healing of erosive esophagitis (Table 3). Moreover, recurrence rates reported in the maintenance therapy with 10 or 20 mg of vonoprazan was numerically lower than those reported for maintenance therapy using regular doses of PPIs. Because of many demographic factors such as ethnicity, obesity, and severity of erosive reflux disease in the patients enrolled, this difference should not be interpreted that vonoprazan maintenance with 10 or 20 mg is better than maintenance therapy with regular doses of PPIs. Thus, direct head-to-head comparisons between vonoprazan and regular-dose PPIs are necessary to ascertain whether vonoprazan actually is superior to regular-dose PPIs for maintaining healing. It is unfortunate that recurrence rates according to the baseline severity of reflux disease were not reported in the latter part of this trial. Such information would help physicians understand that vonoprazan should be used for long-term maintenance in patients with severe grade esophagitis, often refractory to PPI maintenance. Although more information is necessary, low rate of recurrence with vonoprazan corroborated well with the data that pH > 4 holding time was important in preventing relapse of healed reflux esophagitis, and provided us with a new armament to protect esophageal mucosal break.

### The role of vonoprazan in patients with erosive esophagitis [^116Wynmo]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Potential drug-to-drug interactions with vonoprazan have come into notice lately. It is reported that vonoprazan is metabolized in the liver mainly driven by CYP3A via cytochrome P450 pathway; thus, it is conceivable that there is interaction of vonoprazan with other drugs undergoing metabolism through this pathway. For instance, clarithromycin, a recognized strong CYP3A inhibitor, is a common component of the triple therapy for the eradication of H. pylori. A phase I study demonstrated that the triple therapy with vonoprazan–amoxicillin–clarithromycin increased the plasma concentration of both vonoprazan and clarithromycin while no changes were observed for amoxicillin, indicating a interference of the metabolism of vonoprazan and clarithromycin, probably via inhibition of CYP3A. A recent study presented in Digestive Disease Week 2022 demonstrated that the plasma exposure of midazolam, a sensitive CYP3A substrate, increased following the coadministration of vonoprazan, as reflected by 1.9-fold increases in C max and AUC values. These data suggest that plasma concentration of other drugs metabolized via CYP3A pathway may increase when administrated concomitantly with vonoprazan, thus lower doses with a narrow therapeutic index should be used. Another study used physiologically based pharmacokinetic modeling to evaluate the impact of moderate and strong CYP3A inducer on vonoprazan exposure, and found that the concentration of vonoprazan decreased by up to 81% when coadministrated with rifampin, a strong CYP3A inducer, and by up to 54% when coadministrated with efavirenz, a moderate CYP3A inducer. That is to say, vonoprazan exposure would decrease when administrated concomitantly with moderate-to-strong CYP3A inducers. Therefore, coadministration of vonoprazan with moderate-to-strong CYP3A inducers should be avoided. In addition, there is potential drug-to-drug interaction of vonoprazan with drugs independent of CYP3A genetic polymorphism. It is reported that the concentration of tacrolimus increases with the co-administration of vonoprazan in kidney transplant recipients, which is not affected by the CYP3A genotype. Drug-to-drug interactions with vonoprazan need further study.

In terms of other adverse events, there were case reports of severe hypomagnesemia due to use of vonoprazan, which improved after drug discontinuation. Changes in the gut microbiome have also been documented with vonoprazan. Therefore, the long-term safety and tolerability of vonoprazan are yet to be confirmed.

### Vonoprazan prevents low-dose aspirin-associated ulcer recurrence: randomised phase 3 study [^112HjLVm]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

Compare efficacy and safety of vonoprazan and lansoprazole for secondary prevention of low-dose aspirin (LDA)-associated peptic ulcers in a 24-week study and long-term extension therapy in separate study.

Design

Double-blind, randomised, non-inferiority study; single-blind extension study at 104 Japanese sites, including 621 patients (439 in extension) with a history of peptic ulcers who required long-term LDA therapy. Randomised (1:1:1, computer generated) patients received lansoprazole 15mg (n = 217), vonoprazan 10mg (n = 202) or vonoprazan 20mg (n = 202) once daily for 24 weeks (double blind) and ≤ 2 years (extension). The following measurements were made: 24-week (primary outcome; double blind) and 12-week peptic ulcer recurrence rate, 24-week GI bleeding rate, cumulative incidences of peptic ulcer recurrence and GI bleeding, treatment-emergent adverse events, laboratory results, serum gastrin and pepsinogen I/II concentrations.

Results

The 24-week peptic ulcer recurrence rate was 2.8%, 0.5% and 1.5% in the lansoprazole 15mg, vonoprazan 10mg and vonoprazan 20mg groups, respectively. Vonoprazan was non-inferior (Farrington and Manning test: margin 8.7%, significance level 2.5%) to lansoprazole. In the post hoc analyses of the extension study, peptic ulcer recurrence rates were significantly lower with vonoprazan 10mg (log-rank test, P = 0.039), but not vonoprazan 20mg (P = 0.260), compared with lansoprazole 15mg. GI bleeding rates were higher with lansoprazole compared with two doses of vonoprazan in both 24-week study and extension study.

Conclusion

Vonoprazan (10 and 20mg) was as effective as lansoprazole (15mg) in preventing peptic ulcer recurrence during LDA therapy, had a similar long-term safety profile and was well tolerated.
