## Question

Provide an in depth review of the classifications (with specific examples) of neuropathies

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for an in-depth review of neuropathy classifications, with specific examples. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the foundational clinical-anatomic framework that anchors bedside pattern recognition. Then, I should verify the electrophysiologic axonal versus demyelinating dichotomy and its limitations. Next, I will examine etiologic categories, including hereditary, metabolic, immune-mediated, toxic, and vasculitic neuropathies, and I should double-check where diabetes fits and how it is subclassified. After that, I will review temporal evolution and fiber-size phenotypes, including small fiber and autonomic involvement. Finally, I will integrate emerging mechanisms such as nodopathies and reconcile conflicting nomenclature, before summarizing a pragmatic diagnostic algorithm with examples and caveats.

> Let me first confirm the foundational clinical-anatomic framework, because misclassification at this level derails downstream testing and treatment. Peripheral neuropathies are commonly described by distribution (symmetric versus asymmetric, focal versus multifocal), modality (sensory, motor, autonomic, or mixed), and fiber caliber (large versus small), and this pattern-based approach remains the most efficient starting point in general practice and subspecialty settings alike [^c8916bd4] [^d5e30a0f] [^f79b8203]. Hold on, I should verify that this aligns with consensus statements; yes, multiple sources converge on using distribution, modality, and fiber type to guide the differential and testing strategy, which I will keep front and center as I proceed [^c8916bd4] [^d5e30a0f] [^f79b8203].

> Next, I should review the traditional electrophysiologic dichotomy of axonal versus demyelinating, but wait, let me verify its limitations before overcommitting. Classically, nerve conduction studies distinguish axonal degeneration (reduced amplitudes with relatively preserved conduction velocities) from demyelination (conduction slowing, temporal dispersion, conduction block), and this informs both prognosis and treatment responsiveness, particularly in immune-mediated neuropathies [^d43758b0] [^2e7256ae]. Hold on, I should verify whether this binary still suffices; emerging evidence shows that some neuropathies, especially autoimmune forms with nodal/paranodal injury, exhibit reversible conduction failure and mixed features that the axonal-demyelinating split fails to capture, prompting the concept of nodopathies as a distinct mechanistic category [^52238264] [^7e91aeb7] [^5eb6f008]. I need to ensure I flag this caveat explicitly so we do not mislabel antibody-mediated neuropathies as purely axonal when they are actually nodal and potentially reversible [^52238264] [^7e91aeb7].

> I will now examine etiologic classification, starting with hereditary neuropathies, and I should double-check the scope and nomenclature. Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease remains the most common inherited neuromuscular disorder, with over 60 genes implicated and a classification that evolved from clinical (CMT1 demyelinating, CMT2 axonal) to molecular, though phenotypic overlap complicates simple genotype-phenotype mapping and necessitates phenotype-guided testing strategies [^674af7a4] [^d346ebca] [^baf818ad]. Wait, let me verify the testing approach; guidelines support genetic testing when the phenotype is classic or when hereditary features are suspected, with panels tailored to demyelinating versus axonal patterns and inheritance, while acknowledging that many patients with cryptogenic polyneuropathy lack a classic hereditary phenotype and thus may not benefit from routine screening [^baf818ad] [^d346ebca].

> Next, I should review metabolic and endocrine neuropathies, and I need to ensure I anchor diabetes correctly. Diabetic neuropathies are the most common acquired neuropathies, with distal symmetric polyneuropathy (DSPN) as the prototypical form, but diabetes also produces focal/multifocal radiculoplexus neuropathies, mononeuropathies, and autonomic neuropathy; importantly, up to half of diabetic neuropathy may be asymptomatic, so screening and prevention are essential [^8ada66a5] [^498c4240]. Hold on, I should verify the subclassification language; contemporary reviews distinguish typical DSPN from atypical phenotypes and emphasize that non-diabetic neuropathies can coexist and may be treatable, reinforcing the need to avoid anchoring bias in people with diabetes [^8ada66a5] [^498c4240]. I should also confirm that rigorous glycemic control slows progression in type 1 diabetes and has more modest effects in type 2, which shapes counseling and goals of care [^8ada66a5].

> I will now examine immune-mediated neuropathies, and I need to check the evolving taxonomy. Guillain-Barré syndrome, CIDP, anti-MAG neuropathy, and multifocal motor neuropathy are key entities, and the 2021 EAN/PNS guideline refines CIDP variants into typical, distal, multifocal/focal, motor, motor-predominant, and sensory-predominant categories using standardized clinical and electrophysiologic criteria, which improves diagnostic uniformity and trial comparability [^427aa395]. But wait, what if the pathophysiology is nodal rather than demyelinating; indeed, antiganglioside and nodal/paranodal antibody–mediated neuropathies demonstrate reversible conduction failure and axonal injury without classic demyelination, supporting the nodopathy construct and explaining rapid recovery in some cases [^52238264] [^7e91aeb7]. I should confirm that recognizing these mechanisms matters therapeutically, as it influences expectations for recovery and choice of immunotherapy [^52238264] [^7e91aeb7].

> Let me consider toxic neuropathies next, and I should double-check the typical phenotypes. Most toxic neuropathies are axonal, length-dependent, and sensory-predominant, with notable exceptions such as vincristine causing severe motor involvement and oxaliplatin producing acute cold-triggered dysesthesias; recognition and withdrawal of the offending agent are the cornerstone of management, and many improve or stabilize after exposure ends [^c70f1ac6]. Hold on, I should verify emerging culprits; immune checkpoint inhibitors and BRAF/MEK inhibitors are increasingly recognized causes, and oncology guidelines now provide evidence-based recommendations for prevention and management of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy, underscoring the need for proactive surveillance and dose modification strategies [^c70f1ac6] [^ef77c390].

> I will now examine vasculitic neuropathies, and I need to ensure I distinguish systemic from non-systemic forms. Vasculitic neuropathy typically presents with painful mononeuropathy multiplex or an asymmetric polyneuropathy of acute or subacute onset due to ischemic nerve injury; classification by vessel size (nerve large arteriole versus microvasculitis) correlates with course and prognosis, though modern imaging is reshaping this dichotomy [^5cfa69d5] [^45ec6d36]. Wait, let me verify the diagnostic approach; nerve biopsy remains the gold standard in suspected nonsystemic vasculitic neuropathy, while ANCA-associated vasculitides require systemic evaluation, and early immunosuppression prevents irreversible axonal loss, so delays in recognition carry substantial morbidity [^5cfa69d5] [^45ec6d36].

> Next, I should review temporal evolution and fiber-size phenotypes, and I need to check where small fiber neuropathy fits. Neuropathies are described by tempo as acute (< 4 weeks), subacute (4–8 weeks), chronic (> 8 weeks), or relapsing-remitting, which helps prioritize emergencies like GBS versus indolent processes like hereditary or toxic neuropathies [^7e91aeb7]. Small fiber neuropathy presents with pain, burning, and autonomic symptoms while conventional nerve conduction studies are often normal; corneal confocal microscopy and skin biopsy for intraepidermal nerve fiber density provide diagnostic confirmation when SFN is suspected, and consensus criteria endorse a combined clinical-functional-structural approach to improve reliability [^0cb81252] [^2dbdc215]. Hold on, I should verify autonomic involvement in diabetes; cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy is common and clinically consequential, warranting routine screening in diabetes care pathways [^912dc3b8].

> I should now integrate emerging mechanistic categories, particularly nodopathies, and I need to ensure I reconcile them with the classic axonal-demyelinating split. Nodopathies reflect primary injury at the node of Ranvier or paranodes, producing reversible conduction failure and, in some cases, secondary axonal degeneration; this mechanism explains why some "axonal" immune neuropathies recover rapidly and why the traditional dichotomy is inadequate in antibody-mediated disorders [^52238264] [^7e91aeb7] [^5eb6f008]. Let me reconsider the practical implication: recognizing nodopathy shifts testing toward antiganglioside and nodal/paranodal antibodies and supports early immunotherapy when indicated, aligning treatment with pathophysiology rather than an outdated label [^52238264] [^7e91aeb7].

> But wait, what about nomenclature heterogeneity and the need for aligned definitions across specialties. Disparate terminology, especially in systemic autoimmune diseases like Sjögren's, complicates care and research; recent interdisciplinary efforts propose standardized descriptors for PNS manifestations, emphasizing anatomic pattern, fiber type, electrophysiology, and pathophysiology to improve communication and comparability [^f79b8203] [^4cb06b6e]. I should double-check that this aligns with broader consensus; yes, multiple sources call for harmonized nomenclature to reduce misclassification and facilitate multicenter studies and guideline implementation [^f79b8203] [^4cb06b6e].

> Finally, I will synthesize a pragmatic diagnostic algorithm and I need to ensure it remains clinically actionable. Start with pattern recognition of distribution, modality, and fiber caliber; apply electrodiagnostics to distinguish axonal from demyelinating and to detect multifocality; layer in targeted labs based on phenotype (glucose, B12, TSH, SPEP with immunofixation, and selective antibodies such as anti-MAG, antiganglioside, or nodal/paranodal antibodies); consider nerve or skin biopsy when the presentation is atypical or SFN/vasculitis is suspected; and escalate to genetic testing when hereditary features are present or the course is chronic and unexplained [^c8916bd4] [^d43758b0] [^baf818ad] [^0cb81252]. Hold on, I should verify that this aligns with evidence-based guidance; the AAN/AAEM DSP case definition and subsequent reviews endorse combining symptoms, signs, and electrodiagnostics to increase diagnostic certainty, while specialty guidelines refine when to add biopsy, antibody testing, and genetics, which I have incorporated here [^007535ea] [^c8916bd4] [^baf818ad].

> In summary, neuropathy classification operates on multiple, intersecting axes: clinical-anatomic pattern, electrophysiologic mechanism, etiology, temporal evolution, and fiber-size phenotype, with emerging mechanisms like nodopathy challenging the traditional axonal-demyelinating dichotomy. Maintaining awareness of these dimensions and applying a structured, phenotype-driven workup yields faster diagnosis, avoids misclassification, and matches therapy to mechanism, ultimately improving outcomes for patients across the spectrum of peripheral neuropathies [^c8916bd4] [^52238264] [^8ada66a5].

Neuropathies are classified by **distribution** (symmetric vs asymmetric; focal, multifocal, or diffuse), **fiber type** (sensory, motor, autonomic, or mixed), and **pathophysiology** (axonal, demyelinating, or mixed) [^c8916bd4]. Common examples include **distal symmetric polyneuropathy** (e.g. diabetic, alcoholic, or idiopathic), **mononeuropathies** (e.g. carpal tunnel, Bell's palsy), and **mononeuropathy multiplex** (e.g. vasculitic, leprosy). Additional categories include hereditary (e.g. Charcot-Marie-Tooth), immune-mediated (e.g. Guillain-Barré, CIDP), infectious (e.g. HIV, leprosy), metabolic (e.g. diabetes, B12 deficiency), toxic (e.g. chemotherapy, alcohol), and compressive/entrapment syndromes [^8ada66a5] [^2e7256ae] [^c70f1ac6]. Classification guides diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment, with electrodiagnostics and, when indicated, nerve biopsy or genetic testing refining the category [^d43758b0] [^baf818ad].

## Anatomic distribution

Neuropathies are classified by **anatomic distribution** into the following categories:

| **Category** | **Description** | **Examples** |
|-|-|-|
| Mononeuropathy | Single nerve involvement | - Carpal tunnel syndrome <br/> - Bell's palsy <br/> - Radial nerve palsy |

| Plexopathy | Brachial or lumbosacral plexus involvement | - Brachial plexopathy <br/> - Lumbosacral plexopathy |

---

## Fiber type involvement

Neuropathies are also classified by the **type of nerve fibers involved**:

- **Sensory neuropathy**: Predominantly sensory symptoms (e.g. numbness, tingling, pain).
- **Motor neuropathy**: Predominantly motor symptoms (e.g. weakness, atrophy).
- **Autonomic neuropathy**: Involvement of autonomic fibers (e.g. orthostatic hypotension, gastrointestinal dysmotility, sudomotor dysfunction).
- **Mixed neuropathy**: Combination of sensory, motor, and/or autonomic involvement.

---

## Pathophysiological classification

Neuropathies are classified by **pathophysiology** as follows:

- **Axonal neuropathy**: Primary axonal degeneration (e.g. diabetic neuropathy, alcoholic neuropathy, toxic neuropathies).
- **Demyelinating neuropathy**: Primary demyelination (e.g. Guillain-Barré syndrome, CIDP, hereditary demyelinating neuropathies).
- **Mixed neuropathy**: Both axonal degeneration and demyelination (e.g. diabetic neuropathy, some hereditary neuropathies).

---

## Etiological classification

Neuropathies are classified by **etiology** into several broad categories:

| **Category** | **Examples** |
|-|-|
| Hereditary | - Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease <br/> - Hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathies (HSAN) <br/> - Familial amyloid polyneuropathy |
| Acquired | - Diabetic neuropathy <br/> - Alcoholic neuropathy <br/> - Nutritional deficiencies (B12, thiamine) <br/> - Toxic neuropathies (chemotherapy, heavy metals) <br/> - Infectious neuropathies (HIV, leprosy, Lyme disease) <br/> - Immune-mediated neuropathies (GBS, CIDP, vasculitic neuropathy) <br/> - Paraneoplastic neuropathies |

## Specific examples of neuropathies

### Distal symmetric polyneuropathy (DSPN)

- **Description**: Symmetric, length-dependent, predominantly sensory, often with autonomic involvement.
- **Examples**: Diabetic neuropathy, alcoholic neuropathy, idiopathic neuropathy, chemotherapy-induced neuropathy.

---

### Mononeuropathies

- **Carpal tunnel syndrome**: Median nerve entrapment at the wrist.
- **Bell's palsy**: Facial nerve involvement causing facial weakness.
- **Radial nerve palsy**: "Saturday night palsy" from compression.

---

### Immune-mediated neuropathies

- **Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS)**: Acute demyelinating polyneuropathy.
- **Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP)**: Chronic demyelinating polyneuropathy.
- **Multifocal motor neuropathy (MMN)**: Multifocal motor neuropathy with conduction block.

---

### Hereditary neuropathies

Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease is the most common hereditary neuropathy with **demyelinating and axonal forms**, and hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathies are characterized by prominent sensory and autonomic involvement.

---

## Diagnostic approach

Classification is guided by **clinical evaluation**, **electrodiagnostic studies** (nerve conduction studies and electromyography), and, when indicated, **nerve biopsy** or **genetic testing**. Electrodiagnostics distinguish axonal from demyelinating processes and help localize lesions, while biopsy confirms inflammatory or vasculitic neuropathies, and genetic testing identifies hereditary forms [^d43758b0] [^baf818ad].

---

Neuropathies are classified by **distribution, fiber type, pathophysiology, and etiology**, with specific examples including diabetic neuropathy, carpal tunnel syndrome, Guillain-Barré syndrome, and Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. This classification guides diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment.

### Mechanisms of disease: mechanism-based classification of neuropathic pain-a critical analysis [^40cfa495]. Nature Clinical Practice: Neurology (2006). Medium credibility.

Classification of neuropathic pain according to etiology or localization has clear limitations. The discovery of specific molecular and cellular events following experimental nerve injury has raised the possibility of classifying neuropathic pain on the basis of the underlying neurobiological mechanisms. Application of this approach in the clinic is problematic, however, owing to a lack of precise tools to assess symptoms and signs, and difficulties in correlating symptoms and signs with mechanisms. Development and validation of diagnostic methods to identify mechanisms, together with pharmacological agents that specifically target these mechanisms, seems to be the most logical and rational way of improving neuropathic pain treatment.

Disparate definitions of neuropathies

The Sjögren's Foundation convened an interdisciplinary panel of experts to develop evidence‐based CPGs for PNS manifestations of SjD. This panel, including neurologists and rheumatologists, followed an evidence‐based process during which it became clear that the medical literature contains disparate definitions of types of neuropathies. Examples are provided in Table 1.

Which type is the most common in SjD? As shown in Table 1, different studies suggested different frequencies, in part due to the small sample size in most studies. Together, heterogeneity of data and definitions often leads to difficulty in understanding and reconciling the data.

### International neuropathy workshop of 2009: introduction to the final reports [^22f4a1f2]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Neuropathies are amongst the most common of the long-term complications of diabetes, affecting up to 50% of patients. Their clinical features vary immensely and patients may present with a wide spectrum of specialties, from neurology to urology, for example, or from cardiology to podiatry. Neuropathies are typically characterized by a progressive loss of nerve fibres which may affect both of the principal divisions of the peripheral nervous system. The epidemiology and natural history of the diabetic neuropathies remain poorly defined. The International Consensus Workshop in Toronto in 2009 arose from the fact that at the moment there are no clear, universally accepted guidelines regarding the definition of diabetic neuropathies. This has resulted in a massive variation in how neuropathy is diagnosed in different centres and countries. A preliminary summary report of the Toronto meeting was published in 2010. The series of papers published in this issue of Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews are the detailed reports that came from each sub-group of this Consensus panel. These reviews cover the problems with definitions and classification of neuropathy, the management of painful neuropathy and then the sub-group of small fibre neuropathies. There are also 3 papers on the autonomic neuropathies, covering cardiovascular autonomic neuropathies, as well as other areas of the autonomic neuropathies including gastrointestinal, urogenital and pseudomotor neuropathies. This series of papers will give the reader detailed information on the diverse aspects of diabetic neuropathies, their measurement and management, and will also assist in the selection of appropriate measures of both autonomic and somatic nerve function in clinical trials. This is clearly work in progress as diagnostic criteria for diabetic neuropathies are likely to evolve with developments in the field.

Long lists of causes of peripheral neuropathy make peripheral nerve disease a dry and uninspiring subject. A simple scheme based on the answers to just six questions should enable the clinician to recognise characteristic patterns, investigate relevant subgroups appropriately, and identify treatable disorders quickly: which systems are involved? What is the distribution of weakness? What is the nature of the sensory involvement? Is there any evidence of upper motor neuron involvement? What is the temporal evolution? Is there any evidence for a hereditary neuropathy? Standard screening investigations suffice for the common length dependent axonal neuropathies while complex presentations need more detailed investigations targeted to their clinical phenotype.

### Hereditary neuropathies [^fd87af76]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The purpose of this review is to help neurologists understand new concepts in hereditary neuropathies, from the clinician's point of view, in the molecular era after the burst of information regarding peripheral nerve biology.

Recent Findings

Recent studies have focused on understanding the pathomechanisms involved in hereditary neuropathies. In the past year identification of new genes has slowed down since scientists have concentrated more on the function of genes causing Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease and Schwann cell-axon interactions to reveal the molecular cell biology of the disease. Animal models for the most common subtypes of human Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease are now available.

Summary

Rapid advances in the molecular genetics and cell biology of hereditary neuropathies have highlighted the great genetic complexity of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. The evolution from a simple clinical classification to a complex molecular one has not facilitated our understanding of the disease. Moreover, the new molecular classification is not simple to use as different mutations of the same gene produce a range of phenotypes. The clinicians have to look for specific clinical and electrophysiological clues to direct the patient to appropriate genetic testing.

### New classification of autoimmune neuropathies based on target antigens and involved domains of myelinated fibres [^52238264]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

Autoimmune neuropathies are named by eponyms, by descriptive terminology or because of the presence of specific antibodies and are traditionally classified, on the basis of pathology and electrophysiology, as primary demyelinating or axonal. However, autoimmune disorders targeting specific molecules of the nodal region, although not showing pathological evidence of demyelination, can exhibit all the electrophysiological changes considered characteristic of a demyelinating neuropathy and acute neuropathies with antiganglioside antibodies, classified as axonal and due to nodal dysfunction, can present with reversible conduction failure and prompt recovery that appear contradictory with the common view of an axonal neuropathy. These observations bring into question the concepts of demyelinating and axonal nerve conduction changes and the groundwork of the classical dichotomous classification. We propose a classification of autoimmune neuropathies based on the involved domains of the myelinated fibre and, when known, on the antigen. This classification, in our opinion, helps to better systematise autoimmune neuropathies because points to the site and molecular target of the autoimmune attack, reconciles some contrasting pathological and electrophysiological findings, circumvents the apparent paradox that neuropathies labelled as axonal may be promptly reversible and finally avoids taxonomic confusion and possible misdiagnosis.

### Diabetic neuropathies: update on definitions, diagnostic criteria, estimation of severity, and treatments [^648f9d36]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

Diabetic polyneuropathy is one of the most common long-term complications of diabetes affecting ∼50% of all diabetic people. This review by an international panel of experts examines recent literature regarding diagnostic criteria for DPN, painful DPN, and autonomic neuropathy and makes diagnostic recommendations in the context of clinical practice and research. The review also discusses emerging markers of DPN. Finally, the diagnostic criteria for DPN are likely to evolve with developments in the field, and there is clearly a need for experts in the field to provide periodic updates.

### Practice advisory for the prevention of perioperative peripheral neuropathies 2018: an updated report by the American society of anesthesiologists task force on prevention of perioperative peripheral neuropathies [^f87f3522]. Anesthesiology (2018). Medium credibility.

Availability and strength of evidence — classification and reporting — define Category A evidence as results obtained from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and Category B evidence as observational results obtained from nonrandomized study designs or RCTs without pertinent comparison groups, with Category A evidence given precedence when available. These categories are divided into evidence levels, and only the highest level of evidence is included in the summary report for each intervention–outcome pair with a directional designation of benefit, harm, or equivocal. Category A RCTs report comparative findings, and statistically significant (P < 0.01) outcomes are designated as beneficial (B) or harmful (H) for the patient, whereas statistically nonsignificant findings are designated equivocal (E). Level 1 is when the literature contains a sufficient number of RCTs to conduct meta-analysis and meta-analytic findings are reported as evidence; Level 2 when multiple RCTs are present but not sufficient to conduct a viable meta-analysis and findings are reported separately as evidence; and Level 3 when the literature contains a single RCT with findings reported as evidence. Because a minimum of five independent RCTs are required for meta-analysis, meta-analyses were not conducted for this Practice Advisory.

### Acquired neuropathies [^1830b2f9]. Journal of Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

Acquired neuropathies represent most of the neuropathies encountered in clinical practice. Hundreds of causes have been identified even though up to 41% of patients are still classified as idiopathic (Rajabally and Shah in J Neurol 258:1431–1436, 1). Routine evaluation relies on comprehensive medical history taking, clinical examination, nerve conduction studies and laboratory tests. Other investigations such as nerve biopsy or nerve or muscle imaging are performed in specific settings. This review focuses on recent advances in acquired neuropathies.

### Sensory neuropathies, from symptoms to treatment [^6ed70030]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The present review focuses on recent developments in diagnosis and treatment of sensory neuropathies. It does not seek to establish a comprehensive classification of sensory neuropathies, nor treatment guidelines per se.

Recent Findings

Diagnostic criteria and guidelines have been developed for distal symmetric polyneuropathies, small fiber sensory neuropathies and sensory neuronopathies. Novel diagnostic tools such as skin biopsies now allow diagnosis of small fiber sensory neuropathies. Genetic testing has defined new subtypes of mitochondrial neuropathies and inherited neuropathies with sensory involvement. Intravenous immunoglobulin and tumor necrosis factor-alpha inhibitors show promise for some dysimmune sensory neuropathies or neuronopathies. Additional options for management of neuropathic pain are emerging.

Summary

Diagnostic methods for both acquired and hereditary sensory neuropathies have progressed in recent years, leading to earlier and more specific diagnoses and a better understanding of disease mechanisms. Much progress remains to be made regarding symptomatic and disease-modifying therapy for a range of sensory neuropathies, including those due to diabetes, HIV infection and from dysimmune or hereditary causes.

### Charcot-Marie-Tooth diseases: an update and some new proposals for the classification [^674af7a4]. Journal of Medical Genetics (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease, the most frequent form of inherited neuropathy, is a genetically heterogeneous group of disorders of the peripheral nervous system, but with a quite homogeneous clinical phenotype (progressive distal muscle weakness and atrophy, foot deformities, distal sensory loss and usually decreased tendon reflexes). Our aim was to review the various CMT subtypes identified at the present time.

Methods

We have analysed the medical literature and performed a historical retrospective of the main steps from the individualisation of the disease (at the end of the nineteenth century) to the recent knowledge about CMT.

Results

To date, > 60 genes (expressed in Schwann cells and neurons) have been implicated in CMT and related syndromes. The recent advances in molecular genetic techniques (such as next-generation sequencing) are promising in CMT, but it is still useful to recognise some specific clinical or pathological signs that enable us to validate genetic results. In this review, we discuss the diagnostic approaches and the underlying molecular pathogenesis.

Conclusions

We suggest a modification of the current classification and explain why such a change is needed.

Table 1
Examples of disparate neuropathy classification in Sjögren's Disease

Regardless of the classification method used, a basic knowledge of anatomy and pathophysiology is essential to understand the spectrum of clinical presentations of neuropathies. Damage to or dysfunction of large nerve fibers (myelinated Aβ axons mediating the sensations of proprioception, vibration, and touch) typically leads to paresthesia and ataxia. Motor nerve involvement leads to clinical or subclinical muscle weakness. Damage to the small nerve fibers (ie, thinly myelinated A δ and unmyelinated C fibers) leads to SFN, which affects pain and temperature sensations. Therefore, SFN causes sensory symptoms, usually pain, numbness, and tingling but not muscle weakness or ataxia.

Electrodiagnostic studies are invaluable tools in characterizing neuropathy, but one must understand their utility and limitations. Nerve conduction studies and electromyography can reveal patterns of neuropathy and nerve fiber type involvement as well as demonstrate axonal or demyelinating pathophysiology, but electrophysiologic abnormalities may not entirely correspond to clinical findings, which can be confusing to practitioners. For example, most patients with SjD with electrophysiologic evidence of sensorimotor polyneuropathy have predominantly sensory symptoms with minimal or no clinical muscle weakness. Another point of confusion is that routine nerve conduction studies do not detect SFN, and a skin biopsy or specialized neurophysiologic testing may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis. Similarly, specialized autonomic nervous system testing is needed to demonstrate autonomic neuropathy but may not be available in all locations. Despite the challenges, electrophysiologic studies complement the clinical examination to better assess and classify PNS disorders.

### Inherited neuropathies: clinical overview and update [^d346ebca]. Muscle & Nerve (2013). Low credibility.

Inherited neuropathy is a group of common neurologic disorders with heterogeneous clinical presentations and genetic causes. Detailed neuromuscular evaluations, including nerve conduction studies, laboratory testing, and histopathologic examination, can assist in identification of the inherited component beyond family history. Genetic testing increasingly enables definitive diagnosis of specific inherited neuropathies. Diagnosis, however, is often complex, and neurologic disability may have both genetic and acquired components in individual patients. The decision of which genetic test to order or whether to order genetic tests is often complicated, and the strategies to maximize the value of testing are evolving. Apart from rare inherited metabolic neuropathies, treatment approaches remain largely supportive. We provide a clinical update of the various types of inherited neuropathies, their differential diagnoses, and distinguishing clinical features (where available). A framework is provided for clinical evaluations, including the inheritance assessment, electrophysiologic examinations, and specific genetic tests.

### An update on the classification and treatment of vasculitic neuropathy [^09cb8077]. The Lancet: Neurology (2005). Medium credibility.

Vasculitic neuropathy usually presents with painful mononeuropathies or an asymmetric polyneuropathy of acute or subacute onset. The disorder should be classified as being systemic or non-systemic. Systemic vasculitis should be further classified into one of the primary and secondary forms. Although specific treatment regimens vary among neurologists, basic principles can be applied. Corticosteroids and cytotoxic drugs have been the mainstay of treatment for most forms of vasculitic neuropathy. Here we discuss dosing, potential side-effects, and management recommendations of conventional treatments. New treatments showing promise include intravenous immunoglobulin and biological agents and trials of the newest treatments are being reviewed. Future trials should compare commonly used treatment regimens and better establish the efficacy of newer, potentially safer, treatments.

### Peripheral neuropathies: a practical approach for the hospitalist [^50033ce2]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Peripheral neuropathies are a common problem with a myriad of potential etiologies that may be encountered acutely. Early diagnosis of certain neuropathies can lead to life-saving therapy. This article reviews the literature on diagnostic approaches to peripheral neuropathies and suggests a structured framework of pattern recognition and systematic evaluation to aid the hospitalist in efficient evaluation of urgent cases.

### Removing the idiopathic from the chronic sensory neuropathies [^9ad3c860]. Brain (2021). Medium credibility.

Peripheral neuropathies are common. Estimated to affect around 2.4% of the general population, rising to 8% in those over the age of 55, neuropathies can cause significant morbidity, and can sometimes be fatal. Peripheral nerves consist of motor nerves that convey motor signals from the spinal cord to the peripheries, sensory nerves that convey sensory signals from the peripheries to the CNS, along with sympathetic and parasympathetic nerve fibres that together make up the autonomic nervous system. While neuropathies can be classified into acute and chronic forms, they can also present symmetrically or in an asymmetric manner. Moreover, using neurophysiological and pathological criteria, neuropathies are often classified into demyelinating or axonal forms, reflecting the principal site of pathology as the myelin-forming Schwann cell or the axon, respectively. Furthermore, neuropathies can be classified into those that are inherited, such as the Charcot-Marie-Tooth and related disorders, and those believed to be acquired. Of the latter group, the commonest risk factor associated with an acquired peripheral neuropathy seen in European populations is diabetes mellitus, while infectious and toxic causes remain prevalent worldwide. Nevertheless, despite careful and thorough investigation, it is estimated that between 20% and 40% of neuropathies that present to the clinic have no identifiable cause — hence the longstanding and common use of 'idiopathic' or 'cryptogenic' — and are now grouped together under the diagnostic label of 'chronic idiopathic axonal polyneuropathy' (CIAP).

The CIAPs mainly present with sensorimotor involvement (where both sensory and motor symptoms and signs exist), but a pure sensory neuropathy has also long been recognized, along with a rarer pure motor syndrome. Onset of symptoms is generally in the fifth decade and electrophysiological and histopathological studies are consistent with axonal degeneration. These neuropathies tend to deteriorate slowly and management is currently supportive and focused on symptoms. Previous observational studies aimed at identifying latent underlying risk factors and causes have been largely unsuccessful, hindering efforts to develop effective therapies.

In contrast, many other forms of neuropathy are treatable. While acquired inflammatory neuropathies are commonly managed with immunomodulation, the past decade has seen the development of novel yet effective therapies for previously untreatable inherited neuropathies. These treatments are the culmination of years of scientific investigation which began with the discovery of mutations in disease-associated genes in affected families, followed by the deciphering of molecular pathological mechanisms at the cellular level, leading finally to the identification of potential therapeutic pathways amenable to pharmacological targeting.

### Inflammatory neuropathies: pathology, molecular markers and targets for specific therapeutic intervention [^d94fb751]. Acta Neuropathologica (2015). Low credibility.

Inflammatory neuropathies encompass groups of heterogeneous disorders characterized by pathogenic immune-mediated hematogenous leukocyte infiltration of peripheral nerves, nerve roots or both, with resultant demyelination or axonal degeneration or both. Inflammatory neuropathies may be divided into three major disease categories: Guillain-Barré syndrome (particularly the acute inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy variant), chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy and nonsystemic vasculitic neuropathy (or peripheral nerve vasculitis). Despite major advances in molecular biology, pathology and genetics, the pathogenesis of these disorders remains elusive. There is insufficient knowledge on the mechanisms of hematogenous leukocyte trafficking into the peripheral nervous system to guide the development of specific molecular therapies for immune-mediated inflammatory neuropathies compared to disorders such as psoriasis, inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatoid arthritis or multiple sclerosis. The recent isolation and characterization of human endoneurial endothelial cells that form the blood-nerve barrier provides an opportunity to elucidate leukocyte-endothelial cell interactions critical to the pathogenesis of inflammatory neuropathies at the interface between the systemic circulation and peripheral nerve endoneurium. This review discusses our current knowledge of the classic pathological features of inflammatory neuropathies, attempts at molecular classification and genetic determinants, the utilization of in vitro and in vivo animal models to determine pathogenic mechanisms at the interface between the systemic circulation and the peripheral nervous system relevant to these disorders and prospects for future potential molecular pathology biomarkers and targets for specific therapeutic intervention.

### An electrodiagnostic approach to the evaluation of peripheral neuropathies [^d43758b0]. Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Electrodiagnosis, which includes nerve conduction and needle electromyographic studies, is an essential element in the evaluation of peripheral neuropathies. A systematic approach to the electrodiagnostic evaluation aids in clarifying the distribution and extent of involvement, type of nerve damage, and time course. When these data are combined with clinical information, a full characterization of the neuropathy is possible leading to a sound differential diagnosis and selection of rational tests to order. This article will discuss the relevant anatomy and physiology of peripheral nerves and the principles of nerve conduction and needle electromyographic studies, including how they help distinguish between prototypic examples of primary axonal and demyelinating neuropathies, how to plan electrodiagnostic studies, and how to interpret data from outside studies.

### Diabetic neuropathies: update on definitions, diagnostic criteria, estimation of severity, and treatments [^d7f262e0]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

CLASSIFICATION AND DEFINITION OF DIABETIC NEUROPATHIES

The neuropathies developing in patients with diabetes are known to be heterogenous by their symptoms, pattern of neurologic involvement, course, risk covariates, pathologic alterations, and underlying mechanisms. Thomas and Boulton et al. separated these into generalized and focal/multifocal varieties (e.g. multiple mononeuropathy, lumbosacral, thoracic, and cervical radiculoplexus neuropathies). It is known that similar patterns of neuropathy occur in patients without diabetes. Moreover, diabetic patients can develop chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculopathy.

The evidence that generalized varieties can be further classified into at least two major subgroups seems compelling. The typical DPN is a chronic, symmetrical, length-dependent sensorimotor polyneuropathy (DSPN) and is thought to be the most common variety. It develops on (or with) a background of long-standing hyperglycemia, associated metabolic derangements (increased polyol flux, accumulation of advanced glycation end products, oxidative stress, and lipid alterations among other metabolic abnormalities) and cardiovascular risk factors. Alterations of microvessels, similar to those observed in diabetic retinopathy and nephropathy, appear to be associated with the pathologic alterations of nerves. Total hyperglycemic exposure is perhaps the most important risk covariate. This variety has been shown to be stabilized, perhaps even improved, by rigorous glycemic control. This polyneuropathy has been shown to be statistically associated with retinopathy and nephropathy. Autonomic dysfunction and neuropathic pain may develop over time.

The atypical DPNs are different from DSPN in several important features, i.e. onset, course, manifestations, associations, and perhaps putative mechanisms. They appear to be intercurrent varieties, developing at any time during the course of a patient's diabetes. Onset of symptoms may be acute, subacute, or chronic, but the course is usually monophasic or fluctuating over time. Pain and autonomic symptoms are typical features and altered immunity has been suggested. Studies have suggested that impaired fasting glucose or impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) is more common in chronic idiopathic axonal polyneuropathy, but other studies do not support this view.

### Neuropathic pain: an updated grading system for research and clinical practice [^95de3baf]. Pain (2016). Low credibility.

5. Limitations and future directions

Based on the narrative literature review and discussions in the committee, we identified several weaknesses in our current knowledge about neuropathic pain and issues that need to be addressed in the future.
(1) The lack of positive criteria for identifying non-neuropathic pain, and the lack of pathognomonic features of neuropathic pain make it difficult to reach a level of "definite" neuropathic pain. Previous attempts to define a gold standard for neuropathic pain have been hampered by the inherent circular bias imposed by the fact that the criteria for defining clinical neuropathic pain are also used as measures in newly introduced tools. One important area of research will be to use the present grading system as a reference standard against which other neuropathic pain approaches should be systematically validated. In this goal, it will be important to perform field testing of this system, in particular, to assess its test-retest reliability and inter-rater reliability.
(2) The lack of pain diagnostic tools for low resource settings and the need for more educational efforts. Screening tools may be helpful, but at a single-patient level, they may wrongly classify some patients (false-positive) or fail to identify other patients (false-negative).
(3) In research based only on clinical history, such as questionnaire surveys and patient interviews, only the level of "possible" neuropathic pain can be reached and even then only sometimes. Although validated questionnaires exist, these questionnaires were mostly developed based on the old and less precise IASP definition, and there is no validated approach to defining relevant pain distribution and history.
(4) Variability of innervation territories of roots, nerves and fascicles as well as difficulty in quantitating sensory function in deep tissues such as joints and muscles and visceral tissues can make it difficult to identify neuropathic pain in certain cases, and current textbook figures are based on often imprecise renditions of very old data from relatively small case series. In future, it is important to generate probabilistic maps of innervation territories and to develop methods for the assessment of sensory function in joints and muscles and visceral tissues. Identification of appropriate control areas for specific conditions, establishment of inter- and intra-examiner reliability, and assessment of the use of patient self-examination, are also needed.
(5) The possible presence of neuropathic pain in conditions where lesions or diseases of the somatosensory nervous system occur secondary to an inflammatory condition is not clear. Examples are osteoarthritis, in which there may be a decrease in the innervations in the synovial lining layer and increase in the innervations of cartilage with concomitant sensory abnormalities in the skin, and chronic pancreatitis, in which histopathology shows evidence of local nerve involvement.

3 CLASSIFICATION OF THE PERIPHERAL NEUROPATHIES

Since the end of the 19th century, peripheral neuropathies have been classified according to their clinical characteristics, leading, over time, to the following possibilities: symmetrical (polyneuropathy) or asymmetrical (mononeuropathy and multiple mononeuropathy), involvement including nerve roots (polyradiculoneuropathy) and involvement primarily affecting the cell bodies (neuronopathy). Peripheral neuropathies can also be classified according to their mode of onset: acute (onset in less than 4 weeks), subacute (onset in 4 to 8 weeks), chronic (onset in more than 8 weeks), or relapsing–remitting. Since the middle of the 20th century, with the development of clinical neurophysiology, peripheral neuropathies are traditionally classified as "demyelinating" or "axonal", according to whether the pathologic process affects primarily the myelin/SC or the axon.

In the 1990's, this traditional dichotomy ("axonal" vs. "demyelinating") has been questioned when some subtypes of Guillain–Barré syndrome (GBS) were identified as " axonal GBS " (nowadays known as "acute motor axonal neuropathy" [AMAN] or "acute motor and sensory axonal neuropathy", [AMSAN]). However, in AMAN/AMSAN, the primary attack is directed toward the excitable nodal axolemma, inducing a temporary failure of conduction at the NoR named "reversible conduction failure" (RCF), possibly because of loss of Nav channels, (distinguishing it from the classical demyelinating conduction block); secondary, there may be (in the more severe cases) axonal degeneration (giving an electrophysiological pattern of axonal neuropathy). The recent discovery of pathogenic antibodies targeting the nodal and/or the paranodal regions has led to the recognition of a new group of antibody‐mediated neuropathies, nowadays called "nodoparanodopathies": this term was first proposed to characterize a common pathogenic mechanism of dysfunction/disruption at the NoR resulting in a pathophysiological continuum from transitory nerve conduction failure to axonal degeneration. It is difficult to determine the incidence of this new entity, which may be around 5% of GBS and chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) patients. A new classification of autoimmune peripheral neuropathies based on the involved domains of the myelinated fiber and, when known, on the antigen has now been presented.

### Leukodystrophies: a proposed classification system based on pathological changes and pathogenetic mechanisms [^b09cecdc]. Acta Neuropathologica (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusions

The diagnostic approach combining MRI pattern recognition with next generation sequencing has remarkably increased the number of diagnosable genetic white matter disorders, and confirmed that many are due to defects in gene products specifically or also expressed in cell types other than the oligodendrocyte. The last decades have also witnessed a tremendous increase in the knowledge of the white matter demonstrating that all cell types inhabiting it are involved in its development, maintenance, function and repair. This has challenged the traditional myelin-centric view of leukodystrophies that is now proved surpassed. We support a novel definition of leukodystrophy that reflects the current knowledge: leukodystrophies are all genetically determined disorders primarily affecting the CNS white matter, irrespective of the structural white matter component involved, the molecular process affected and the disease course. In the wake of this definition, we here propose a new classification of leukodystrophies based on a cellular pathology approach that takes into account the contribution of cell types other than oligodendrocytes and structures other than myelin driving white matter pathology, including astrocytes, axons, microglia and blood vessels. In reviewing the neuropathology and disease mechanisms of some leukodystrophies, we show that this classification also provides systematic additional information regarding the pathogenesis. The complicated interplay between the different white matter components in the healthy CNS necessarily implies that the diseases mechanisms underlying leukodystrophies are also complex. Our classification therefore also recognizes the possibility that a specific disease does not primarily affect only one cell type or structure and with that belongs to more than one category. Giant axonal neuropathy, for example, is due to defects in gigaxonin that maintains neuroaxonal cytoskeletal integrity and transport, but is also responsible for proper intermediate filament degradation in astrocytes. In other disorders, the neuropathology may be characterized by prominent secondary involvement of selected white matter components. MLC, for example, is due to a defective function of the astrocyte-specific protein MLC1, which is involved in astrocytic control of ion–water homeostasis. Although MLC is pathologically characterized by intramyelinic edema, this is a secondary phenomenon and MLC is thus categorized under the astrocytopathies. The implications of such information are important. We face a time in which new treatments are being explored, including cell-based replacement treatments, new drugs and small molecules, and therapies aiming at enhancing endogenous repair. It is conceivable that none of the leukodystrophies will be cured by a single treatment, but that they will rather benefit from a combined therapeutic approach. Knowledge on which cells types are involved in the pathophysiology of the single disorder and their disease mechanisms and interactions becomes thus crucial to develop a successful therapeutic strategy for these deleterious and often fatal diseases.

CONCLUSION

Although the validity of the 2021 EFNS/PNS criteria for CIDP has not yet been assessed, they will lead to greater uniformity in the selection of patients to be enrolled in future studies and this, hopefully, will result in greater comparability of studies. Their implementation should also lead to an improvement in diagnostic accuracy. There are still, however, areas of uncertainty in the definition of the individual variants. Recent studies are starting to bring to light the pathogenetic mechanisms of the individual CIDP variants and this could result in the discovery of specific diagnostic biomarkers and new therapies.

### Hereditary neuropathies [^2d21b028]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2003). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review will update recent advances in the genetics, clinico-electrophysiological, pathological data and pathophysiology of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease and related disorders.

Recent Findings

Hereditary neuropathies continue to be in a state of constant flux, reflecting the rapid advances in the description of causative genes, three additional Charcot-Marie-Tooth genes having been identified in recent months. Such an ever-increasing body of genetic data provides valuable clues to the pathogenetic mechanisms of both nerve demyelination and nerve axonal degeneration. The classification of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease is increasingly more complex as there are approximately 26 loci; for clinicians to reach a simplified classification is a pressing need. Genotypic-phenotypic correlations are still incomplete and will require further research, starting from both refined molecular investigations and detailed clinical, electrophysiological, and pathological studies. Recent epidemiological surveys have corroborated the fact that Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease is the most common type of hereditary neuropathy.

Summary

Advances in molecular genetics in hereditary neuropathies, and mainly in Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, have enriched our knowledge of this heterogeneous group of disorders. In spite of this there remain important and basic issues, such as an updated and revised classification of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disorders, the better delineation of phenotypic-genotypic correlations, and further research to map as yet non-localized loci or to identify unknown gene mutations.

### Diagnosis and treatment in inflammatory neuropathies [^0535f8af]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2009). Low credibility.

The inflammatory neuropathies are a large diverse group of immune-mediated neuropathies that are amenable to treatment and may be reversible. Their accurate diagnosis is essential for informing the patient of the likely course and prognosis of the disease, informing the treating physician of the appropriate therapy and informing the scientific community of the results of well-targeted, designed and performed clinical trials. With the advent of biological therapies able to manipulate the immune response more specifically, an understanding of the pathogenesis of these conditions is increasingly important. This review presents a broad overview of the pathogenesis, diagnosis and therapy of inflammatory neuropathies, concentrating on the most commonly encountered conditions.

### Diabetic neuropathies: update on definitions, diagnostic criteria, estimation of severity, and treatments [^037d06e3]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

Definitions of minimal criteria for typical DPN

1. Possible DSPN.

The presence of symptoms or signs of DSPN may include the following: symptoms–decreased sensation, positive neuropathic sensory symptoms (e.g. "asleep numbness", prickling or stabbing, burning or aching pain) predominantly in the toes, feet, or legs; or signs–symmetric decrease of distal sensation or unequivocally decreased or absent ankle reflexes.

2. Probable DSPN.

The presence of a combination of symptoms and signs of neuropathy include any two or more of the following: neuropathic symptoms, decreased distal sensation, or unequivocally decreased or absent ankle reflexes.

3. Confirmed DSPN.

The presence of an abnormality of NC and a symptom or symptoms or a sign or signs of neuropathy confirm DSPN. If NC is normal, a validated measure of small fiber neuropathy (SFN) (with class 1 evidence) may be used.

To assess for the severity of DSPN, several approaches can be recommended: the graded approach outlined above, various continuous measures of sum scores of neurologic signs, symptoms or nerve test scores, scores of function of acts of daily living or of predetermined tasks or of disability. Irrespective of which approach is used, it is necessary to ensure good performance of evaluations with monitoring proficiency.

4. Subclinical DSPN.

The presence of no signs or symptoms of neuropathy are confirmed with abnormal NCs or a validated measure of SFN (with class 1 evidence).

We recommend that definitions 1, 2, or 3 be used for clinical practice and definitions 3 or 4 be used for research studies.

Atypical DPNs

Before further classification of these polyneuropathies, setting the minimal criteria for diagnosis and estimating severity and further characterizing of epidemiologic and mechanistic studies are needed. The issue of painful, autonomic, and nerve morphologic abnormalities are discussed in subsequent sections.

3.2. Case coding

One of the prepared cases referred to a diagnosis (Chronic peripheral neuropathic pain) that had not yet been implemented in the ICD-11 at the time of the field trial, and therefore was excluded from evaluation, leaving 13 pain diagnoses for 11 cases to be rated per participant. Taken together, the participants rated 1342 cases, each case was rated by between 67% (119/177) and 75% (132/177) of participants. Participants assigned the correct code for the pain diagnosis in 83.9% of cases, and in 98.4% of cases, participants reported having no difficulty in assigning the diagnosis (Table 2). The aggregated clinical utility (the mean for the individual facets) was high across all cases (4.3 ± 0.90) on a scale ranging from 0 (not at all useful) to 5 (very useful) and all single cases (Table 2).

Table 2
Case coding.

Text box 1.
Morbidity coding rules

Morbidity rule 1 (MB1): Several conditions recorded as the "main condition". Select the "main condition" for which the patient received care. Extension codes may be used to indicate different types of main condition (eg, reason for admission or main resource condition). In cases where the main condition cannot be determined based on documentation, select the condition that is mentioned first.
Morbidity rule 2 (MB2): Condition recorded as "main condition" is presenting symptom of diagnosed, treated condition. If a symptom or sign (ICD-11 chapter 21) or a problem (ICD-11 chapter 24) is recorded as the "main condition", and this is obviously a sign, symptom, or problem of a diagnosed condition coded elsewhere, and care was given to the latter, reselect the diagnosed condition as the "main condition".
Morbidity rule 3 (MB3): Signs and symptoms. When a symptom or sign is documented as the "main condition", and it is documented that it could be caused by either one condition or another, select the symptom or sign as "main condition".

### Vasculitic neuropathies [^5cfa69d5]. The Lancet: Neurology (2014). Medium credibility.

The vasculitic neuropathies are a diverse group of disorders characterised by the acute-to-subacute onset of painful sensory and motor deficits that result from inflammatory destruction of nerve blood vessels and subsequent ischaemic injury. They are common in patients with primary systemic vasculitis and are seen in vasculitis secondary to disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis, viral infections, and diabetic inflammatory neuropathies. It is imperative that neurologists recognise these disorders to initiate treatment promptly and thereby prevent morbidity and mortality. To simplify the approach to patients with vasculitis of the peripheral nerves, a straightforward, dichotomous classification scheme can be used in which the vasculitic neuropathies are divided into two groups-nerve large arteriole vasculitis and nerve microvasculitis-on the basis of the size of the involved vessels. The size of the affected blood vessels correlates with the clinical course and prognosis in patients with vasculitic neuropathy.

### Toxic neuropathies: a practical approach [^c70f1ac6]. Practical Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Toxic neuropathies result from exogenous substances damaging the peripheral nerves. There are numerous causes, including prescribed and recreational drugs, heavy metals, industrial agents and biological toxins. Timely recognition of these neuropathies gives better outcomes, as they usually improve or stabilise once the toxin is removed. Most toxic neuropathies are axonal, length-dependent and sensory predominant, although some have significant motor involvement or can present acutely or subacutely. Here, we outline our clinical approach and discuss the major causes of toxic neuropathy, while emphasising the clinical and neurophysiological features and the neuropathy phenotype. We also include an update on newer medications that can cause neuropathy, including immune checkpoint inhibitors and BRAF/MEK inhibitors.

### Distal symmetric polyneuropathy: a definition for clinical research: report of the American Academy of Neurology, the American association of electrodiagnostic medicine, and the American Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation [^007535ea]. Neurology (2005). Medium credibility.

Distal symmetric polyneuropathy case definition — purpose, methodology, and diagnostic certainty criteria are outlined: The objective was to develop a case definition to standardize clinical research and epidemiologic studies, employing a formalized consensus process after a systematic review and classification of evidence. The literature indicates that symptoms alone have relatively poor diagnostic accuracy, signs are better predictors than symptoms, and single abnormalities on examination are less sensitive than multiple abnormalities. Diagnostic certainty is based on combining neuropathic symptoms, signs, and electrodiagnostic findings, with a set of case definitions rank ordered by likelihood of disease; the highest likelihood occurs with a combination of multiple symptoms, multiple signs, and abnormal electrodiagnostic studies, and a lower likelihood occurs when electrodiagnostic studies and signs are discordant. The principal purpose was to develop a definition with a reasonably high sensitivity and specificity to serve as a basis for future research studies.

### Atypical chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy: recent advances on classification, diagnosis, and pathogenesis [^a00c4781]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

DEFINITIONS AND CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE ATYPICAL CHRONIC INFLAMMATORY DEMYELINATING POLYRADICULONEUROPATHY VARIANTS

The 2010 European Federation of Neurological Societies/Peripheral Nerve Society (EFNS/PNS) guidelines for CIDP roughly defined the individual CIDP variants but did not provide criteria that allow to clearly establish the clinical boundaries of each of them. The lack of universally recognized diagnostic criteria for atypical CIDP has favored over the years the proliferation of various definitions for the individual variants and this has resulted in a remarkable heterogeneity among studies regarding their reported frequency, clinical characteristics and response to therapy. Recently, an Italian study proposed a set of diagnostic criteria for atypical CIDP but its validity has not yet been demonstrated. The application of these criteria in a large cohort of patients with atypical CIDP has surprisingly shown that 53% of the patients with atypical CIDP at onset progressed to typical CIDP during the course of the disease. Progression to typical CIDP, however, was not absolute and a considerable proportion of patients maintained their atypical CIDP phenotype even after several years from symptoms onset. Transition from atypical to typical CIDP has been questioned by some authors but other studies confirmed that phenotypes can change over times. Whether this progression reflects only a greater spread of neuropathy or is instead the result of specific pathogenetic mechanisms is still to be clarified.

### Ways to think about vasculitic neuropathy [^45ec6d36]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Vasculitis as a pathomechanism for neuropathy can be isolated to the peripheral nervous system, a part of a systemic autoimmune condition or a component of another syndrome. This review aims to discuss the broad range of diagnoses in which vasculitic neuropathy can be encountered, highlight the progress in imaging techniques in identifying vasculitis, and the new drugs developed for other autoimmune diseases that may be applied to neurological conditions.

Recent Findings

Advances in imaging modalities, ultrasound, MRI and FDG-PET scanning for neuromuscular applications has redefined many aspects of vasculitic neuropathies. The benefit of dividing vasculitides by vessel size is becoming less absolute as diagnostic approaches advance. MRI and FDG-PET are widely used in diagnosis, defining extent of involvement of disease and monitoring. In neuralgic amyotrophy, the identification of hourglass-like constrictions on imaging has changed the treatment paradigm to include surgical interventions. These diagnostic approaches are supported by new immunomodulating and immunosuppression techniques.

Summary

Vasculitic neuropathies are a broad group of conditions with a range of causes and associations. Increased use of imaging techniques impacts our traditional definitions and classifications. The growth in treatment options for other autoimmune conditions are likely to infiltrate the neurological landscape.

### Diagnosis and new treatments in genetic neuropathies [^60303804]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2009). Low credibility.

The genetic neuropathies are a clinically and genetically heterogeneous group of diseases of which the most common types are Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT), the hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathies and the distal hereditary motor neuropathies. More than 30 causative genes have been described, making an accurate genetic diagnosis increasingly possible. Although no specific therapies are yet available, research into their pathogenesis has revolutionised our understanding of the peripheral nervous system and allowed the development of rational approaches to therapy. The first therapeutic trials in CMT are currently underway. This review will suggest an approach to the diagnosis of these disorders and provide an update on new therapies.

### The evolving spectrum of complex inherited neuropathies [^737c5a53]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Inherited peripheral neuropathies can be divided into those diseases in which peripheral neuropathy is the sole or main feature of the disease (Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease) and those in which peripheral neuropathy is just one feature of a more complex syndrome. In recent years there has been a substantial expansion in the number of genes associated with complex neuropathy syndromes.

Recent Findings

This review will focus on emerging themes in this group of diseases, namely the increasing number of diseases due to repeat expansions; the emergence of both recessive and dominant negative alleles in the same gene producing a common phenotype and diseases in which there is selective loss of the allele from haematopoietic stem cells making genetic diagnosis on blood derived DNA problematic.

Summary

In this review we provide a practical approach to investigating and diagnosing patients with peripheral neuropathy as part of a complex syndrome and provide an updated table of the genes associated with this group of diseases.

In this review we provide a practical approach to investigating and diagnosing patients with peripheral neuropathy as part of a complex syndrome and provide an updated table of the genes associated with this group of diseases.

### A practical approach to the genetic neuropathies [^40ad0425]. Practical Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease is the commonest inherited neuromuscular disease. It is characterised by degeneration of peripheral sensory and motor nerves and can be classified into axonal and demyelinating forms. This review provides a diagnostic approach to patients with suspected inherited neuropathy and an algorithm for genetic testing that includes recent advances in genetics such as next-generation sequencing. We also discuss important aspects of the long-term management of patients with inherited neuropathy.

### Peripheral neuropathy in complex inherited diseases: an approach to diagnosis [^45abf90d]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2017). Low credibility.

Peripheral neuropathy is a common finding in patients with complex inherited neurological diseases and may be subclinical or a major component of the phenotype. This review aims to provide a clinical approach to the diagnosis of this complex group of patients by addressing key questions including the predominant neurological syndrome associated with the neuropathy, for example, spasticity, the type of neuropathy and the other neurological and non-neurological features of the syndrome. Priority is given to the diagnosis of treatable conditions. Using this approach, we associated neuropathy with one of three major syndromic categories: (1) ataxia, (2) spasticity and (3) global neurodevelopmental impairment. Syndromes that do not fall easily into one of these three categories can be grouped according to the predominant system involved in addition to the neuropathy, for example, cardiomyopathy and neuropathy. We also include a separate category of complex inherited relapsing neuropathy syndromes, some of which may mimic Guillain-Barré syndrome, as many will have a metabolic aetiology and be potentially treatable.

DIAGNOSIS OF ATYPICAL CHRONIC INFLAMMATORY DEMYELINATING POLYRADICULONEUROPATHY

As for typical CIDP, no diagnostic biomarker exist for atypical CIDP making clinical and electrophysiological criteria essential for diagnosis. The 2021 EFNS/PNS criteria refined the diagnostic criteria for the CIDP variants and expanded the 2010 EFNS/PNS criteria by including sensory nerve conduction studies as a mandatory diagnostic criterion and by defining specific clinical and electrophysiological criteria for each CIDP variant. Validity of these diagnostic criteria remains, however, to be established. Furthermore, these criteria still leave some areas of uncertainty. For instance, it is not clear how to classify patients with asymmetric but not multineuropathic CIDP or patients with a sensorimotor polyneuropathic CIDP only involving the proximal and distal segments of the lower limbs.

Atypical CIDP is a challenging diagnosis and its diagnostic workflow and differential diagnosis may differ compared with typical CIDP. In one series of misdiagnosed patients, 44% of the patients misdiagnosed as CIDP were found to satisfy the EFNS/PNS criteria but they were all classified as 'atypical' Compared with the patients with typical CIDP, those with atypical CIDP more frequently were diagnosed in a university hospital and have a diagnostic delay. This lead to a greater disability and more frequent fatigue and treatment dependency. Patients with atypical CIDP phenotypes are also more likely to be falsely labelled as having CIDP (overdiagnosis). The reasons that may explain this diagnostic difficulty include the scarce adherence to the EFNS/PNS criteria, the inability to recognize the distinctive clinical and electrophysiological signs of CIDP and the clinical parameters indicative of a true response to therapy. Given the complexity of the disease and its rarity, several authors have proposed that patients with an atypical CIDP phenotype or with an unexpectedly poor treatment response should be referred to CIDP expertise centres. The 2021 EFNS/PNS guidelines have improved guidance regarding the diagnosis of CIDP in general and the specific diagnosis of the individual variants by suggesting a list of other conditions to be considered in the differential diagnosis and a series of diagnostic tests to be performed to exclude other causes.

### Neuropathic pain: an updated grading system for research and clinical practice [^0e4f3666]. Pain (2016). Low credibility.

4.4. Summary

Compared to the grading system published in 2008, we have
(1) changed the order of the grading criteria to better reflect clinical practice.
(2) annotated the terms used to improve clarity.
(3) recognized the role of screening tools (questionnaires) in neuropathic pain evaluation.
(4) emphasized that reaching the final level of certainty (definite neuropathic pain) confirms clinically that a lesion or disease of the somatosensory nervous system can explain the pain but, as often in neurology, it does not establish causality (ie, there may still be other causes of the pain such as a diabetic ulcer).

The main purpose of the grading system is to help in the classification of the pain as neuropathic. Other types of pain include nociceptive pain, which is pain that arises from actual or threatened damage to non-neural tissue and is due to the activation of nociceptors, and pain that does not fulfill the criteria for either nociceptive or neuropathic pain, such as chronic widespread pain, fibromyalgia, and irritable bowel syndrome. Furthermore, patients may have 2 or more types of pain, and the classification of pain may be particularly difficult if more than one type of pain exist in the same area.

The grading system is intended for use in individual patients in the clinic and for research, but not for classification of diseases. Some patients diagnosed with fibromyalgia may have small fiber pathology and may fulfill the criteria for neuropathic pain whereas others may not. In addition, patients with complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) type II fulfill the criteria for neuropathic pain, whereas patients with type I do not. Complex regional pain syndrome type I is by definition a condition in which no nerve lesion can be verified. Although an inflammatory reaction, considered to be at the core of development of CRPS, can conceivably damage nociceptors, the current pathophysiological evidence for it is limited and inconsistent, and thus does not justify the designation by default of CRPS type I as neuropathic pain. Similarly, individual patients with Parkinson's disease may have neuropathic pain if there is a documented lesion of the somatosensory system and they fulfill the grading criteria, but musculoskeletal pain is an important differential diagnosis. The demonstration of reduced small nerve fibers obtained from skin biopsies in patients with fibromyalgia and Parkinson's disease is at the moment not sufficient evidence per se for labeling pain in these patients as neuropathic. There is currently no evidence to indicate that patients with cluster headache or migraine have lesions of the somatosensory system.

### Peripheral neuropathic pain: a mechanism-related organizing principle based on sensory profiles [^d2dff237]. Pain (2017). Low credibility.

1. Introduction

Neuropathic pain syndromes develop after a lesion or disease affecting the somatosensory nervous system. Despite advances in understanding the complex neurobiology of pain, the pharmacological management of these syndromes remains insufficient and several promising drugs have failed in late-stage development. Thus, there is a need to predict treatment responders both for clinical practice, in which even first-line treatments are beneficial in less than 50% of patients, and for clinical trial design, in which a negative outcome may be due to a low responder rate rather than uniform inefficacy of the treatment.

Although all neuropathic pain disorders have a common denominator, ie, damage of the somatosensory nervous system, the underlying etiologies and pathogeneses of these damages are distinct. Furthermore, the patterns of sensory signs and symptoms that develop after neuropathy vary between the different etiologies and even between individual patients with neuropathies of the same etiology. The expression of these sensory signs, the mosaic of hyperalgesia, allodynia, and sensory loss, which we call the individual somatosensory profile, reflects pathophysiological mechanisms in damaged and surviving afferent nerve fibers such as conduction block, ectopic impulse generation, peripheral sensitization, and central sensitization.

Historically, neuropathic pain has been classified, investigated in clinical trials, and treated on the basis of the underlying etiology. However, recognising the heterogeneity of pain mechanisms other classification schemes might be more appropriate. Thus, an entirely different strategy in which pain is differentiated on the basis of the underlying mechanisms has been proposed emphasizing the rationale for a treatment approach directed at mechanisms rather than diseases.,

Pathophysiological mechanisms of pain generation cannot be readily examined in patients. Nevertheless, the expression of some sensory signs can be related to mechanisms, eg, heat hyperalgesia to peripheral sensitizationand pinprick hyperalgesia to central sensitization. Thus, the individual somatosensory profile may reveal some clues of pathophysiological dysfunctions of afferent processing.

The aim of this investigation was to identify patient subgroups with distinct sensory profiles in a large sample of patients with neuropathic pain from a wide range of etiologies collected in 3 multinational research networks. Instead of testing previously published hypotheses of associations between sensory profiles and mechanisms, this large data set enabled us to apply hypothesis-free statistical segmentation methods. This way we explored the intrinsic patterning of sensory profiles in a representative spectrum of patients with peripheral neuropathic pain. The number and type of intrinsic patterns — if reproducible — can then be related back to pathophysiological and pharmacological mechanisms in future studies.

### Distal symmetric polyneuropathy: a definition for clinical research: report of the American Academy of Neurology, the American association of electrodiagnostic medicine, and the American Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation [^0ee3c807]. Neurology (2005). Medium credibility.

Distal symmetric polyneuropathy (DSP) case definition — expert panel, evidence search, and study selection describes that the Polyneuropathy Task Force included 14 physicians with representatives from AAN, AAEM, and AAPM&R, with three additional physicians providing evidence-based methodology expertise; the literature search included OVID MEDLINE (1970 to April 2004), OVID Excerpta Medica (EMBASE; 1980 to April 2004), and OVID Current Contents (2000 to April 2004); potentially relevant articles were reviewed in full by three reviewers and included if 1) the study included patients with and without DSP, 2) a potential diagnostic predictor (symptom, sign, or test result) was measured, 3) an explicit, predefined independent reference standard determined DSP, and 4) data presentation allowed calculation of sensitivities and specificities; abstracted study characteristics included design, patient numbers, target disorder spectrum, diagnostic predictors, reference standard blinding, and sensitivity and specificity; risk of bias for each article was graded using a diagnostic test classification–evidence scheme, with disagreements resolved through discussion.

### Towards a functional pathology of hereditary neuropathies [^02e5a599]. Acta Neuropathologica (2017). Low credibility.

A growing number of hereditary neuropathies have been assigned to causative gene defects in recent years. The study of human nerve biopsy samples has contributed substantially to the discovery of many of these neuropathy genes. Genotype-phenotype correlations based on peripheral nerve pathology have provided a comprehensive picture of the consequences of these mutations. Intriguingly, several gene defects lead to distinguishable lesion patterns that can be studied in nerve biopsies. These characteristic features include the loss of certain nerve fiber populations and a large spectrum of distinct structural changes of axons, Schwann cells and other components of peripheral nerves. In several instances the lesion patterns are directly or indirectly linked to the known functions of the mutated gene. The present review is designed to provide an overview on these characteristic patterns. It also considers other aspects important for the manifestation and pathology of hereditary neuropathies including the role of inflammation, effects of chemotherapeutic agents and alterations detectable in skin biopsies.

manifestations of

SjD is a systemic autoimmune disease in which almost all body organs can be affected, including the PNS. In addition, SjD is characterized by exocrine gland dysfunction, resulting in dry eyes and dry mouth.PNS involvement in SjD significantly impacts patient quality of life, and a coordinated approach among different subspecialties is essential in the care of these patients.

PNS involvement in SjD frequently poses significant diagnostic challenges to clinicians: it is often the first manifestation of the disease, preceding SjD diagnosis. Certain patterns of PNS involvement, such as small fiber neuropathy (SFN), are more commonly observed in patients who are seronegative (ie, those who are negative for anti‐SSA), in whom the diagnosis cannot be established without a positive minor salivary gland biopsy (MSGB). This can be a diagnostic challenge in practices in which an MSGB is not routinely performed as part of the clinical evaluation.

In addition to the challenge of establishing the diagnosis of SjD, there is the challenge of characterizing the nature of PNS dysfunction. Neuropathies can be classified based on a variety of features: symptomology (ataxic or nonataxic, painful or nonpainful), anatomic pattern of involvement (polyneuropathy vs mononeuropathy vs multiple mononeuropathies, length dependent vs non–length dependent), anatomic localization (peripheral nerve, nerve root, dorsal root ganglia), nerve fiber type affected (large fiber vs small fiber, sensory and/or motor, autonomic), electrophysiology (axonal vs demyelinating), or pathophysiology/etiology (vasculitic, toxic, immune mediated). This has resulted in heterogeneous classification systems and nonuniform nomenclature that interfere with communication in the clinical care of patients and in apprising the literature, as outlined in Table 1.

### The 2021 WHO classification of tumors of the central nervous system: a summary [^5aa4665d]. Neuro-Oncology (2021). Medium credibility.

The fifth edition of the WHO Classification of Tumors of the Central Nervous System (CNS), published in 2021, is the sixth version of the international standard for the classification of brain and spinal cord tumors. Building on the 2016 updated fourth edition and the work of the Consortium to Inform Molecular and Practical Approaches to CNS Tumor Taxonomy, the 2021 fifth edition introduces major changes that advance the role of molecular diagnostics in CNS tumor classification. At the same time, it remains wedded to other established approaches to tumor diagnosis such as histology and immunohistochemistry. In doing so, the fifth edition establishes some different approaches to both CNS tumor nomenclature and grading and it emphasizes the importance of integrated diagnoses and layered reports. New tumor types and subtypes are introduced, some based on novel diagnostic technologies such as DNA methylome profiling. The present review summarizes the major general changes in the 2021 fifth edition classification and the specific changes in each taxonomic category. It is hoped that this summary provides an overview to facilitate more in-depth exploration of the entire fifth edition of the WHO Classification of Tumors of the Central Nervous System.

### Neuropathic pain: an updated grading system for research and clinical practice [^6d58e84a]. Pain (2016). Low credibility.

4.1.1. A history of relevant neurological lesion or disease

There should be a clinical suspicion of a relevant lesion or disease of the somatosensory nervous system (eg, an episode of acute herpes zoster or a traumatic nerve injury). The temporal relationship between the lesion or disease and the pain may vary, but a close temporal relationship helps strengthen the clinical suspicion. The onset of pain is usually immediate or within a few weeks of the lesion or disease but may be delayed for up to several months after injury (eg, after stroke) or for many years in conditions with an insidious onset such as diabetic neuropathy. In some cases, the history of pain or sensory disturbances by themselves suggest a disease, eg, in polyneuropathy (peripheral neuropathy), where the insidious onset of distal pain or numbness may be the only history indicating the disease. Characteristic sudden short-lasting (usually a few seconds) paroxysmal pain in the face, which may recur several times and may be separated by a refractory period (usually some minutes), suggests trigeminal neuralgia, where the pain is the only symptom indicating a relevant neurological disease.

4.1.2. Pain distribution neuroanatomically plausible

The pain distribution should be anatomically consistent with the suspected location of the lesion or disease in the peripheral or central somatosensory nervous system (as derived from the patient's history). This can be difficult to decipher in the single patient, as the distribution of pain can occupy a smaller area or extend somewhat outside the innervation territory of a peripheral nerve or root or the somatotopic representation of the body within the central nervous system, but it should be in a distribution that is typical for the underlying disorder (see examples in Table 1). In painful channelopathies, the pain distribution may be unusual but should be consistent with the disorder, eg, familial episodic pain syndrome, in which pain is mainly localized to the chest and upper arms, or inherited erythromelalgia, in which pain is localized to the extremities (feet and hands and in some cases ears).

Table 1.
Common neuropathic pain conditions and neuroanatomically plausible distribution of pain symptoms and sensory signs.

When both requirements 1 and 2 of the pain history are fulfilled, the pain complaint may be termed possible neuropathic pain.

### Definition and classification of dystonia [^ea7c5c5b]. Movement Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Our review identified the main limitations of the original classification and addressed some specific issues related to its clinical implementation. The lack of guidelines and examples detailing how to implement the nomenclature led to some inconsistencies in application; in addition, there were questions on how to implement the classification in young children. The revision effort did not alter the general architecture. Classification criteria are intended to be used in already diagnosed patients to classify them for clinical and research purposes. This updated classification includes a new section on phenomenology, which may further facilitate the diagnostic process, although specific diagnostic criteria for dystonia are necessary in parallel.

Functional (psychogenic) dystonia is now listed under dystonia mimics. Although functional dystonia may seem phenomenologically similar to other dystonias, specific criteria can apply to it, such as sudden onset, distractibility, suppressibility, and other atypical and additional functional features. Functional dystonia is often a component of a mixed functional phenotype.

This revision, based on extensive discussion among the panelists, provides an update of the original classification with clarification of established and new terminology. We hope that this updated classification will be utilized by clinicians and researchers in their practice and in future scientific advances in the diagnosis and treatment of dystonia.

### Molecular pathogenesis of hereditary motor, sensory and autonomic neuropathies [^8932f8b8]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2001). Low credibility.

The hereditary motor, sensory and autonomic neuropathies are a heterogeneous group of neurological diseases. The classification of such is presently in a state of change. The original classification system was based on clinical findings whose limitations are being unfurled with increasing insights into the molecular basis of these disorders. In particular, much progress has been achieved in understanding the demyelinating forms of Charcot-Marie-Tooth (type 1), for which at least a dozen loci have been delineated and six genes identified. As anticipated, these genes play predominant roles in myelin biology. Four separate loci for the axonal Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathies (type 2) have been identified and only now are researchers beginning to tease out the responsible genes and the underlying molecular mechanisms. Similarly, progress is being made with the pure hereditary motor neuropathies. This review presents an updated list of genes responsible for inherited peripheral neuropathies and explores the underlying molecular mechanisms actively being investigated.

Distal symmetric polyneuropathy (DSP) evidence review — literature search methods, screening, and yield are specified. The literature search included OVID MEDLINE (1966 to March 2007), OVID Excerpta Medica (EMBASE; 1980 to March 2007), and OVID Current Contents (2000 to March 2007), included humans only and all languages, and used terms peripheral neuropathy, polyneuropathy, and distal symmetric polyneuropathy cross‑referenced with diagnosis, electrophysiology, autonomic testing, nerve biopsy, and skin biopsy. Each potentially relevant article was reviewed in entirety by at least three panel members, risk of bias was graded using the diagnostic test classification‑of‑evidence scheme in which Class I is lowest risk and Class IV is highest risk, and final approval was determined by the entire panel. The Polyneuropathy Task Force included 19 physicians. The search yielded 1,045 references with abstracts, and 106 articles were reviewed and classified.

### Recommendations for aligned nomenclature of peripheral nervous system disorders across rheumatology and neurology [^4cb06b6e]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Aligned nomenclature of theneuropathies

This stark lack of standardized nomenclature highlights a broader issue impacting effective communication across medical specialties. To address this need, the Sjögren's Foundation PNS guideline panel undertook an effort to create shared definitions of the types of neuropathies that occur in SjD. The project aimed to define specific PNS manifestations that could be understood across disciplines and interdisciplinary teams. We initially identified differences in terminology and definitions used by both specialties as well as areas of overlap. We then developed an aligned nomenclature and defined the terminology used to describe specific peripheral neurologic manifestations of SjD to ensure agreement among rheumatologists, neurologists, and other medical specialties (Table 2). Terms describing seven PNS categories were delineated, with descriptions of clinical presentations, possible etiologies, diagnoses, pathologies, and evaluation. This included commonly used synonymous terms for clarification.

### Polyneuropathy quality measurement set: quality improvement in neurology [^5ae8619d]. Neurology (2022). High credibility.

Polyneuropathy measurement set — measure types and mapping classifies three quality measures into process, intermediate outcome, and outcome categories: the process measure is pain assessment for patients with neuropathy; intermediate outcome measures are offering appropriate neuropathic pain medications to patients with neuropathy and reducing opioid prescriptions for painful neuropathy; and outcome measures are addressing neuropathic pain in patients with neuropathy and reducing harms from opioid use in patients with painful neuropathy.

### Diagnosis of acute neuropathies [^620cbf81]. Journal of Neurology (2007). Low credibility.

Acute and subacute polyneuropathies present diagnostic challenges since many require prompt initiation of treatment in order to limit axonal degeneration and since an exact and detailed diagnosis is a prerequisite for making the correct choice of treatment. It is for instance of utmost importance to recognize whether the underlying pathological changes are due to demyelination or to axonal degeneration and electrodiagnostic tests can thus in most cases contribute considerably to the securing of an exact diagnosis. The specific and characteristic electrophysiological findings in the different types of acute and subacute neuropathies are discussed, and the various electrophysiological pitfalls and technical problems, which are met in these patients, are mentioned.

### Diabetic neuropathies [^636e284a]. Muscle & Nerve (2025). Medium credibility.

Diabetic neuropathy is a frequent complication of diabetes, presenting with a wide range of symptoms. These include symmetric distal motor dysfunction, sensory abnormalities (including positive and negative sensory symptoms), radiculoplexus neuropathies, mononeuropathies, and autonomic dysfunction. The condition can manifest in various forms, each with distinct characteristics. There is now more understanding regarding the pathophysiology of diabetic neuropathies with regard to what makes sensory neurons more susceptible to injury and bioenergetic failure in peripheral nervous system neurons. This monograph provides an overview of the different types of diabetic neuropathy, addresses the management of more common forms associated with diabetes, and highlights recent updates in the field, including nutraceuticals.

### The expanding genetic landscape of hereditary motor neuropathies [^f977584b]. Brain (2020). Medium credibility.

Hereditary motor neuropathies are clinically and genetically diverse disorders characterized by length-dependent axonal degeneration of lower motor neurons. Although currently as many as 26 causal genes are known, there is considerable missing heritability compared to other inherited neuropathies such as Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. Intriguingly, this genetic landscape spans a discrete number of key biological processes within the peripheral nerve. Also, in terms of underlying pathophysiology, hereditary motor neuropathies show striking overlap with several other neuromuscular and neurological disorders. In this review, we provide a current overview of the genetic spectrum of hereditary motor neuropathies highlighting recent reports of novel genes and mutations or recent discoveries in the underlying disease mechanisms. In addition, we link hereditary motor neuropathies with various related disorders by addressing the main affected pathways of disease divided into five major processes: axonal transport, tRNA aminoacylation, RNA metabolism and DNA integrity, ion channels and transporters and endoplasmic reticulum.

### Neuropathic pain: an updated grading system for research and clinical practice [^5a1660e0]. Pain (2016). Low credibility.

2. Procedure

To generate background material and discussion points, we performed a systematic literature search using the Scopus database, which is an abstract and citation database of peer-reviewed literature (including scientific journals, books, and conference proceedings). This database was searched on February 6, 2015 for publications that cited the original NeuPSIG grading paper from 2008. Three review authors (S.H. P.K. and N.B.F.) extracted the following data: (1) use of the citation, (2) classification of the publication as a review, animal or human experimental paper, a clinical study, or others, (3) criteria used for including or classifying patients with neuropathic pain in clinical studies, (4) comparison of the grading with other criteria for identifying neuropathic pain when available, and (5) any issues raised with the grading system.

In addition, all committee members were asked to examine the grading system for possible deficiencies that could require modification or amendment in a subsequent iteration of the grading system. Participants convened under the auspices of NeuPSIG in Nice, France, on May 14, 2015. Before the meeting, all participants were provided with a documentation folder that included results from the literature review and issues identified by committee members. At the meeting, data on the use of the grading paper were presented, and individual participants provided short overviews on issues with the grading system that had been identified before the meeting. Discussions pertaining to the issues identified before the meeting and new issues raised by participants at the meeting were used to inform modifications to the existing grading system. Before and after the meeting, the process and update were discussed through e-mail, and after circulating draft manuscripts through e-mail, a final update was agreed through consensus by e-mail.

Learning to recognize the various clinical and electrodiagnostic patterns of peripheral neuropathy enables a targeted approach to etiologic investigation, and subsequently guides patient discussions of self-management, disease course, and prognosis. Moreover, as advancements in neuropathology and pharmacotherapy inform the many etiologies of polyneuropathy, it is imperative for clinicians to identify the underlying etiology to appropriately guide treatment options and prevent complications.

### Acquired peripheral neuropathy [^59cd48fc]. Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

The element of time is a crucial factor in the electrodiagnostic presentation of PN. The characteristic changes seen in various neuropathies evolve over time. If testing is performed very early in the course of the disease, abnormalities may not yet be present, in part, because the range of normal values for NCS parameters is broad. In addition, if the process is asymmetric, the affected nerves may not be sampled. Very late in the course of the disease, a multifocal process may appear diffuse and symmetric as the areas of focal involvement coalesce. A primarily, demyelinating process may begin to demonstrate secondary axonal involvement. In very severe neuropathies, it may become difficult to evoke any NCS responses to characterize the neuropathy. It is essential to place the electrodiagnostic findings within the context of the clinical progression to avoid drawing erroneous conclusions. Sometimes, the true nature of the neuropathy is clear only after sequential testing. The etiologic diagnoses of acquired polyneuropathy are vast. A well-crafted electrodiagnostic evaluation can categorize neuropathies into more specific diagnostic groups by identifying the descriptive diagnosis, significantly narrowing the list of possible etiologic diagnoses. Electrodiagnostic testing, which always starts with a pertinent history and physical examination, should always be viewed as a continuation and quantification of the physical examination. Only by knowing the extent and pattern of the clinical involvement is it possible to formulate a thorough electrodiagnostic evaluation. This knowledge is especially important in cases in which the presentation is multifocal, because the neuropathy can be missed entirely if the affected nerves are not evaluated. When evaluating a neuropathy, there are three important questions to answer: (1) Is the process diffuse or multifocal? (2) Is it demyelinating or axonal? (3) Does it predominantly involve the motor or sensory nerves? By assessing the neuropathy along these three axes, the large number of possible etiologic diagnoses becomes much more manageable.

Signs are better predictors of polyneuropathy than symptoms and should be weighted more heavily (Level B). A single abnormality upon examination is less sensitive than multiple abnormalities in predicting the presence of polyneuropathy; therefore, an examination for polyneuropathy should look for a combination of signs (Level B). Relatively simple examinations are as accurate in diagnosing polyneuropathy as complex scoring systems; therefore, the case definition can use simple examinations without compromising accuracy (Level B). There is too much inconsistency among the studies describing autonomic signs and symptoms to support their use in the case definition (Level U).

### The various Charcot-Marie-Tooth diseases [^a956971c]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review focuses on recent advances in the diagnostic approaches and the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease. We also discuss the emerging therapies for this hereditary neuropathy.

Recent Findings

To date, numerous genes are implicated in CMT, and new genes have recently been found to be associated with this neuropathy (INF2, FBLN5, etc.). Some specific or evocative clinical signs of CMT subtypes (proteinuria with INF2 mutations, etc.) have been identified. Characteristic pathological findings, which may suggest gene mutations, are also recognized by nerve biopsy (mainly ultrastructural lesions).

Summary

CMT disease is the most common inherited neuromuscular disorder, with a fairly homogeneous clinical phenotype (progressive distal muscle weakness and atrophy, foot deformities, distal sensory loss, and depressed tendon reflexes). With more than 40 genes implicated, an update of the present and rather confusing classification of CMT is needed. Over the last few years, new mutated genes have been discovered. Although nerve biopsy is not routinely carried out in CMT neuropathies, it may show characteristic features, which can orientate the search for the mutated gene. There are currently no effective medications for CMT, but clinical trials are ongoing or planned.

### Screening for diabetic peripheral neuropathy in resource-limited settings [^630b9723]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2023). Medium credibility.

Table 1 shows a chronology of important events in the history of diabetic peripheral neuropathy. Generally, the events can be grouped into two periods: foundation (second century AD — nineteenth century AD) and expansion (twentieth century AD — present).

Table 1
Milestones in the history of diabetic peripheral neuropathy

ADA: American Diabetes Association, DCCT: Diabetes Control and Complications Trial, DM: Diabetes mellitus, EDIC: Epidemiology of Diabetes Interventions and Complications

In the foundation period, major discoveries made by John Rollo in 1798, Charles-Jacob Marchal de Calvi in 1864, and Thomas Pryce in 1887 firmly established the relationship between DM, peripheral nerve dysfunction, and foot ulceration. Frederick Pavy described the signs and symptoms of diabetic peripheral neuropathy in 1885, while Ernst Viktor von Leyden proposed an early classification system that distinguished hyperesthetic, motor, and ataxic forms in 1887.

The expansion period is characterized by various advancements that are currently ongoing including: long-term population-based research on DM and its complications; use of objective approaches such as electrophysiological testing to detect nerve dysfunction in patients with diabetic peripheral neuropathy; refinement of diagnostic criteria and classification systems for diabetic peripheral neuropathy; and widespread implementation of structured foot screening programs for early detection of diabetic peripheral neuropathy and prevention of complications.

### Diabetic neuropathy [^8ada66a5]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2019). High credibility.

The global epidemic of prediabetes and diabetes has led to a corresponding epidemic of complications of these disorders. The most prevalent complication is neuropathy, of which distal symmetric polyneuropathy (for the purpose of this Primer, referred to as diabetic neuropathy) is very common. Diabetic neuropathy is a loss of sensory function beginning distally in the lower extremities that is also characterized by pain and substantial morbidity. Over time, at least 50% of individuals with diabetes develop diabetic neuropathy. Glucose control effectively halts the progression of diabetic neuropathy in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus, but the effects are more modest in those with type 2 diabetes mellitus. These findings have led to new efforts to understand the aetiology of diabetic neuropathy, along with new 2017 recommendations on approaches to prevent and treat this disorder that are specific for each type of diabetes. In parallel, new guidelines for the treatment of painful diabetic neuropathy using distinct classes of drugs, with an emphasis on avoiding opioid use, have been issued. Although our understanding of the complexities of diabetic neuropathy has substantially evolved over the past decade, the distinct mechanisms underlying neuropathy in type 1 and type 2 diabetes remains unknown. Future discoveries on disease pathogenesis will be crucial to successfully address all aspects of diabetic neuropathy, from prevention to treatment.

### Diabetic neuropathies: update on definitions, diagnostic criteria, estimation of severity, and treatments [^39d790b5]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

Estimating severity.

Estimating the severity of DSPN has not received the attention it deserves. For a given patient with diabetes, it is not sufficient to simply identify patients as having or not having DSPN — severity also needs to be ascertained. We suggest a reliable objective and quantitative measure (i.e. NC abnormality) as the minimal criteria for the diagnosis of DSPN. When NC values have not been assessed, it is not possible to provide a confirmed diagnosis of DSPN — only a possible or probable diagnosis. Since the severity of DSPN is a combination of neuropathy symptoms, signs, neurophysiologic test abnormalities, and other dysfunctions and impairments, the sum scores of various measures of neurologic signs, symptoms, neurophysiologic test abnormalities, or scores of function of activities of daily living may provide an indication of the severity.

An alternative approach to estimating severity is to indicate severity by grades. Dyck described the stages of severity:
Grade 0 = no abnormality of NC, e.g. Σ 5 NC normal deviates < 95th percentile or another suitable NC criterion
Grade 1a = abnormality of NC, e.g. Σ 5 NC normal deviates ≥ 95th percentile without symptoms or signs
Grade 1b = NC abnormality of stage 1a plus neurologic signs typical of DSPN but without neuropathy symptoms
Grade 2a = NC abnormality of stage 1a with or without signs (but if present, < 2b) and with typical neuropathic symptoms
Grade 2b = NC abnormality of stage 1a, a moderate degree of weakness (i.e. 50%) of ankle dorsiflexion with or without neuropathy symptoms.

### Axonal Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease: from common pathogenic mechanisms to emerging treatment opportunities [^4ae4a047]. Neurotherapeutics (2021). Medium credibility.

Inherited peripheral neuropathies are a genetically and phenotypically diverse group of disorders that lead to degeneration of peripheral neurons with resulting sensory and motor dysfunction. Genetic neuropathies that primarily cause axonal degeneration, as opposed to demyelination, are most often classified as Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2 (CMT2) and are the focus of this review. Gene identification efforts over the past three decades have dramatically expanded the genetic landscape of CMT and revealed several common pathological mechanisms among various forms of the disease. In some cases, identification of the precise genetic defect and/or the downstream pathological consequences of disease mutations have yielded promising therapeutic opportunities. In this review, we discuss evidence for pathogenic overlap among multiple forms of inherited neuropathy, highlighting genetic defects in axonal transport, mitochondrial dynamics, organelle-organelle contacts, and local axonal protein translation as recurrent pathological processes in inherited axonal neuropathies. We also discuss how these insights have informed emerging treatment strategies, including specific approaches for single forms of neuropathy, as well as more general approaches that have the potential to treat multiple types of neuropathy. Such therapeutic opportunities, made possible by improved understanding of molecular and cellular pathogenesis and advances in gene therapy technologies, herald a new and exciting phase in inherited peripheral neuropathy.

### Peripheral neuropathy: evaluation and differential diagnosis [^c8916bd4]. American Family Physician (2020). Medium credibility.

Peripheral neuropathy, a common neurologic problem encountered by family physicians, can be classified clinically by the anatomic pattern of presenting symptoms and, if indicated, by results of electrodiagnostic studies for axonal and demyelinating disease. The prevalence of peripheral neuropathy in the general population ranges from 1% to 7%, with higher rates among those older than 50 years. Common identifiable causes include diabetes mellitus, nerve compression or injury, alcohol use, toxin exposure, hereditary diseases, and nutritional deficiencies. Peripheral neuropathy is idiopathic in 25% to 46% of cases. Diagnosis requires a comprehensive history, physical examination, and judicious laboratory testing. Early peripheral neuropathy may present as sensory alterations that are often progressive, including sensory loss, numbness, pain, or burning sensations in a "stocking and glove" distribution of the extremities. Later stages may involve proximal numbness, distal weakness, or atrophy. Physical examination should include a comprehensive neurologic and musculoskeletal evaluation. If the peripheral nervous system is identified as the likely source of the patient's symptoms, evaluation for potential underlying etiologies should initially focus on treatable causes. Initial laboratory evaluation includes a complete blood count; a comprehensive metabolic profile; fasting blood glucose, vitamin B12, and thyroid-stimulating hormone levels; and serum protein electrophoresis with immunofixation. If the initial evaluation is inconclusive, referral to a neurologist for additional testing (e.g., electrodiagnostic studies, specific antibody assays, nerve biopsy) should be considered. Treatment of peripheral neuropathy focuses on managing the underlying etiology. Several classes of medications, including gabapentinoids and antidepressants, can help alleviate neuropathic pain.

### Nodopathies of the peripheral nerve: an emerging concept [^5eb6f008]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2015). Low credibility.

Peripheral nerve diseases are traditionally classified as demyelinating or axonal. It has been recently proposed that microstructural changes restricted to the nodal/paranodal region may be the key to understanding the pathophysiology of antiganglioside antibody mediated neuropathies. We reviewed neuropathies with different aetiologies (dysimmune, inflammatory, ischaemic, nutritional, toxic) in which evidence from nerve conductions, excitability studies, pathology and animal models, indicate the involvement of the nodal region in the pathogenesis. For these neuropathies, the classification in demyelinating and axonal is inadequate or even misleading, we therefore propose a new category of nodopathy that has the following features: (1) it is characterised by a pathophysiological continuum from transitory nerve conduction block to axonal degeneration; (2) the conduction block may be due to paranodal myelin detachment, node lengthening, dysfunction or disruption of Na(+) channels, altered homeostasis of water and ions, or abnormal polarisation of the axolemma; (3) the conduction block may be promptly reversible without development of excessive temporal dispersion; (4) axonal degeneration, depending on the specific disorder and its severity, eventually follows the conduction block. The term nodopathy focuses to the site of primary nerve injury, avoids confusion with segmental demyelinating neuropathies and circumvents the apparent paradox that something axonal may be reversible and have a good prognosis.

### Autoimmune nodo-paranodopathies of peripheral nerve: the concept is gaining ground [^07e539cc]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

Peripheral neuropathies are classified as primarily demyelinating or axonal. Microstructural alterations of the nodal region are the key to understand the pathophysiology of neuropathies with antibodies to gangliosides and the new category of nodo-paranodopathy has been proposed to better characterise these disorders and overcome some inadequacies of the dichotomous classification. Recently, the research in autoimmune neuropathies has been boosted by reports of patients carrying immunoglobulin G4 antibodies against paranodal axo-glial proteins with distinct phenotypes and showing loss of transverse bands, terminal myelin loop detachment, nodal widening and axonal loss. These patients have been classified up to now as chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy but, in our opinion, better fit into the nodo-paranodopathy category because nerve injury is due to dismantling of the paranode, segmental de-remyelination is absent and the pathogenic mechanism is not inflammatory. Evidence from nerve conductions and electron microscopy studies in patients and mutant animal models can reconcile the apparent contrast between the electrophysiological 'demyelinating' features, explainable just by the paranodal involvement and the axonal pathology. These patients broaden the autoimmune nodo-paranodopathy category and re-emphasise the usage of the term that pointing to the site of nerve injury reminds specific pathophysiological mechanisms, reconciles contrasting electrophysiological and pathological findings, and avoids misdiagnosis and taxonomic confusion. In our opinion, the nodo-paranodopathy term more adequately classifies the peripheral nerve disorders due to an autoimmune attack directed and limited to the nodal region integrating the traditional classification of peripheral neuropathies.

### Diagnosis and treatment of chronic acquired demyelinating polyneuropathies [^2e7256ae]. Nature Reviews: Neurology (2014). Medium credibility.

Chronic neuropathies are operationally classified as primarily demyelinating or axonal, on the basis of electrodiagnostic or pathological criteria. Demyelinating neuropathies are further classified as hereditary or acquired-this distinction is important, because the acquired neuropathies are immune-mediated and, thus, amenable to treatment. The acquired chronic demyelinating neuropathies include chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP), neuropathy associated with monoclonal IgM antibodies to myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG; anti-MAG neuropathy), multifocal motor neuropathy (MMN), and POEMS syndrome. They have characteristic — though overlapping — clinical presentations, are mediated by distinct immune mechanisms, and respond to different therapies. CIDP is the default diagnosis if the neuropathy is demyelinating and no other cause is found. Anti-MAG neuropathy is diagnosed on the basis of the presence of anti-MAG antibodies, MMN is characterized by multifocal weakness and motor conduction blocks, and POEMS syndrome is associated with IgG or IgA λ-type monoclonal gammopathy and osteosclerotic myeloma. The correct diagnosis, however, can be difficult to make in patients with atypical or overlapping presentations, or nondefinitive laboratory studies. First-line treatments include intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg), corticosteroids or plasmapheresis for CIDP; IVIg for MMN; rituximab for anti-MAG neuropathy; and irradiation or chemotherapy for POEMS syndrome. A correct diagnosis is required for choosing the appropriate treatment, with the aim of preventing progressive neuropathy.

### Peripheral neuropathy in antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitides: insights from the DCVAS study [^43ad2d3a]. Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Epidemiologic data on the prevalence of vasculitic neuropathy (VN) in antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (AAV) are contradictory due to heterogeneous recruitment strategies, VN assessments, sample sizes, and length of follow-up across studies. Furthermore, de novo neuropathies in the context of AAV are often inferred to be vasculitic without acknowledging the diagnostic uncertainty.

The Diagnostic and Classification criteria for primary systemic VASculitis (DCVAS) study is a large multinational observational case-control study including more than 6,800 patients. Its primary goal is to define new diagnostic and classification criteria for the primary systemic vasculitides by a prospective analysis of the most discriminating features for each disorder. The DCVAS study captures all major organ systems affected by primary systemic vasculitic disorders including the central and the peripheral nervous system (PNS). As the world's largest prospective study of vasculitis and vasculitis mimics, DCVAS is best suited to answer epidemiologic questions on systemic VN.

In 2010, the Peripheral Nerve Society Guideline established case definitions for nonsystemic and systemic VN that were revised and adapted in 2017 by the Brighton Collaboration Vasculitic Peripheral Neuropathy Working Group into 3 definitions of VN with varying degrees of diagnostic certainty.

For this study, we developed VN criteria compatible with the DCVAS data set, adapted from the previously published criteria, which stratified for the level of certainty (definite, probable, or possible) of the vasculitic origin of the neuropathy. Using these criteria, our study aimed to describe the prevalence and organ associations of de novo VN in AAV at diagnosis within the DCVAS cohort.

### Principles of classification analyses in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer disease [^f30e82f6]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2011). Low credibility.

The majority of advanced neuroimaging studies implement group level analyses contrasting a group of patients versus a group of controls, or two groups of patients. Such analyses may identify for example changes in grey matter in specific regions associated with a given disease. Although such group investigations provided key contributions to the understanding of the pathological process surrounding a wide range of diseases, they are of limited utility at an individual level. Recently, there is a trend towards individual classification analyses, representing a fundamental shift of the research paradigm. In contrast to group comparisons, these latter studies do not provide insights on vulnerable brain areas but may allow for an early (and ideally preclinical) identification of at risk individuals in routine clinical setting. One currently very popular method in this domain are support vector machines (SVM), yet this method is only one of many available methods in the field of individual classification analyses. The current manuscript reviews the fundamental properties and features of such individual level classification analyses in neurodegenerative diseases.

### Pathology explains various mechanisms of auto-immune inflammatory peripheral neuropathies [^11c3a296]. Brain Pathology (2024). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Peripheral neuropathies represent a highly prevalent neurological problem in the general population (incidence: 77/100,000 inhabitants/year; prevalence: 1%–12% in all age groups and up to 30% in older people), because of the high prevalence of some etiologies such as diabetes mellitus, alcoholism, neurotoxic substances (medications, chemotherapies), and renal insufficiency. Other rare causes of peripheral neuropathy may be hereditary (Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease, etc.) or acquired (immune‐mediated, neoplastic, infectious, etc.).

Immune‐mediated diseases may affect the peripheral nervous system by various mechanisms (inflammatory, vascular, etc.) being induced by a process involving cellular and humoral immunities. After a presentation of the main normal histological structure of the myelinated nerve fibers, we discuss here the various pathological aspects of some autoimmune neuropathies. The main objective of this presentation is to show that the pathology illustrates, confirms, and may explain various mechanisms concerning this type of neuropathy.

Distal symmetric polyneuropathy — clinical research case definitions with nerve conduction studies (NCSs) include symptoms and signs with an Ordinal likelihood rating, and 'For clinical research studies enrollment should be limited to cases above the bold horizontal line (i.e., ++++)', as exemplified by a row in which all findings are present and NCSs are abnormal ('Present Present Present Present Abnormal ++++'). Neuropathic symptoms are defined as 'numbness, altered sensation, or pain in the feet', ankle reflex interpretation should consider that 'Ankle reflexes may be decreased in normal individuals older than 65 to 70 years', and NCS specifications are provided ('NCSs = nerve conduction studies' and 'Abnormal NCSs is defined in the body of the article'). The table notes a small-fiber sensory phenotype and specifies that when this phenotype occurs with normal NCSs it 'is not a distal symmetric polyneuropathy' and is 'given a negative (−) ordinal likelihood'.
