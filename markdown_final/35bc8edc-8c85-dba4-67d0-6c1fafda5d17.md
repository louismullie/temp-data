## Question

What is the ICD-10-CM code for folate deficiency anemia?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for the ICD-10-CM code for folate deficiency anemia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the exact ICD-10-CM category for folate-deficiency anemia. Then, I should verify the subcategory options and decide which specific code fits best. Next, I will double-check that I'm not conflating folate with vitamin B12 deficiency, which has a different code family. Finally, I will confirm the code range and provide the most appropriate single code with a brief justification.

> Let me first confirm the category. Folate deficiency anemia is classified under D52, which specifically denotes folate deficiency anemia in ICD-10-CM, distinct from vitamin B12 deficiency anemia (D51) and iron deficiency anemia (D50) [^1befb94c].

> Wait, let me verify the subcategories before I jump to a single code. The D52 family includes D52.0 for dietary folate deficiency anemia, D52.1 for drug-induced folate deficiency anemia, D52.8 for other folate deficiency anemias, and D52.9 for unspecified folate deficiency anemia; I should choose the one that matches the clinical scenario, and if no specific etiology is documented, D52.9 is appropriate [^1befb94c].

> Hold on, I should verify that I'm not mixing this up with B12 deficiency. Vitamin B12 deficiency anemia uses D51.x codes, whereas folate deficiency anemia uses D52.x codes; this is a common pitfall, so I need to ensure the documentation supports folate rather than cobalamin deficiency before assigning D52 [^1befb94c].

> I will now examine the most likely default choice. In the absence of a specified cause such as dietary insufficiency or drug-induced deficiency, the unspecified code D52.9 is the standard fallback that accurately captures "folate deficiency anemia" when no further detail is available [^1befb94c].

> But wait, what if the etiology is known? If the record specifies dietary folate deficiency, I should use D52.0; if it notes drug-induced folate deficiency (for example, methotrexate, sulfasalazine, or anticonvulsants), I should use D52.1; and if there is another specified cause, D52.8 would be correct, so I need to align the code with the documented cause [^1befb94c].

> Final answer: The ICD-10-CM code for folate deficiency anemia is D52.9 when the etiology is not specified; use D52.0 for dietary, D52.1 for drug-induced, or D52.8 for other specified causes when those are documented [^1befb94c].

---

The ICD-10-CM code for folate deficiency anemia is **D52.9** (Folate deficiency anemia, unspecified). Use **D52.0** for dietary folate deficiency anemia, **D52.1** for drug-induced folate deficiency anemia, and **D52.8** for other specified causes. Accurate coding requires documentation of the cause; if unspecified, default to D52.9 [^1befb94c].

## ICD-10-CM codes for folate deficiency anemia

The ICD-10-CM classifies folate deficiency anemia under **category D52**, with subcategories based on etiology:

| **ICD-10-cm code** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| D52.0 | Dietary folate deficiency anemia |
| D52.1 | Drug-induced folate deficiency anemia |
| D52.8 | Other folate deficiency anemias |
| D52.9 | Folate deficiency anemia, unspecified |

---

## Clinical documentation requirements

Accurate ICD-10-CM coding depends on **clear clinical documentation** of the cause of folate deficiency anemia. Coders should not assume etiology; they must rely on the clinician's documentation. If the cause is not specified, use D52.9.

---

## Clinical implications of folate deficiency anemia

Folate deficiency anemia is a **megaloblastic anemia** characterized by macrocytosis, hypersegmented neutrophils, and elevated homocysteine. It can cause significant morbidity, including:

- **Neurological symptoms**: Cognitive impairment, depression, and peripheral neuropathy.
- **Hematological complications**: Severe anemia, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia.
- **Pregnancy complications**: Neural tube defects, preterm birth, and low birth weight [^66fd7b29].

---

## Diagnostic criteria and laboratory findings

Diagnosis of folate deficiency anemia relies on **clinical evaluation and laboratory testing**:

- **Serum folate**: Low levels indicate deficiency.
- **Red blood cell (RBC) folate**: Reflects long-term folate status.
- **Homocysteine levels**: Elevated in folate deficiency.
- **Complete blood count (CBC)**: Macrocytic anemia with elevated mean corpuscular volume (MCV) [^34ec0ea3].

---

## Treatment and management

Management of folate deficiency anemia involves correcting the deficiency and addressing the underlying cause:

- **Folic acid supplementation**: 1–5 mg daily, typically for 4 months, with adjustments based on the cause and patient factors [^243e9748].
- **Dietary modifications**: Increased intake of folate-rich foods (leafy greens, legumes, fortified cereals).
- **Monitoring**: Regular CBC and folate levels to assess response and prevent recurrence [^notfound].

---

## Potential complications if untreated

If left untreated, folate deficiency anemia can lead to **severe complications**, including:

- **Neurological damage**: Persistent cognitive impairment and neuropathy.
- **Increased risk of infections**: Due to impaired immune function.
- **Pregnancy complications**: Neural tube defects and adverse fetal outcomes [^66fd7b29].

---

## Conclusion

The ICD-10-CM code for folate deficiency anemia is **D52.9** (unspecified), with subcategories for dietary, drug-induced, and other specified causes. Accurate coding requires clear documentation of the etiology. Folate deficiency anemia is a significant clinical condition requiring prompt diagnosis and treatment to prevent severe complications.

Defining Anemia

In defining our group for deliveries among individuals with anemia, we aimed to identify patients with prenatal anemia and exclude those who developed anemia at delivery due to acute blood loss. The appropriate combination of ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes to use in identifying our target population was not immediately clear, so we compared 3 candidate definitions with published features of a population of 10 000 pregnant people with prenatal anemia from a retrospective registry. The first candidate definition was anemia of pregnancy: this inclusive definition captured all deliveries coded with any anemia of pregnancy code or subcode. We suspected high sensitivity of this broad definition and low specificity because people with acute peripartum blood loss anemia were also captured with this definition. The second candidate definition was deficiency anemia only: iron deficiency anemia is the most common cause of prenatal anemia. This definition captured all deliveries explicitly coded with iron, folate, or vitamin B12 deficiency. We suspected low sensitivity and high specificity for this definition. However, we were concerned about biasing our group toward individuals with deficiency anemia that began before conception, who may be at higher risk for obstetric outcomes than the general population with prenatal anemia. The third was a mixed definition, for which we included deliveries coded with the general anemia complicating pregnancy code unless those deliveries were also coded with postpartum hemorrhage. We also included deliveries coded with a deficiency anemia code or a code for prenatal anemia of pregnancy regardless of whether the delivery also contained codes for postpartum hemorrhage. Results comparing these approaches are in eTable 2 in Supplement 1. The mixed definition was selected as the anemia definition for this study.

Definition of Analysis Groups

We used 3 analysis groups in our study. The first was the SCD deliveries group, which this consisted of admissions with at least 1 SCD diagnosis code and no sickle cell trait codes. This approach has a greater than 90% positive predictive value for identifying individuals with SCD. Codes for ICD-9 and ICD-10 unreliably identify SCD genotype, so SCD deliveries were not subdivided. The second was the anemia deliveries group, which consisted of admissions without an SCD diagnosis code that met the mixed definition of anemia. The third was the control deliveries group, which consisted of admissions with neither an SCD diagnosis code nor codes meeting the mixed definition of anemia.

Patients admitted to a hospital were classified by primary diagnosis and then allocated a randomized code to maintain anonymity. Access to patient information thereafter was available only at the hospital admission or hospital stay level. The two study cohorts were identified from the PMSI database using International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th Revision (ICD-10) codes. Arthritis, defined as RA and/or OA, included seropositive RA (ICD-10 code M05), other RA (M06), polyarthrosis (M15), coxarthrosis/hip arthrosis (M16), gonarthrosis/knee arthrosis (M17), arthrosis of first carpometacarpal joint (M18), and other arthrosis (M19). A diagnosis of anemia included iron deficiency anemia (D50.0, D50.1, D50.8, D50.9), vitamin B 12 deficiency anemia (D51.0-D51.3, D51.8, D51.9), folate deficiency anemia (D52.0, D52.1, D52.8, D52.9), other nutritional anemias (D53.0-D53.2, D53.8, D53.9), and acquired hemolytic anemias (D59.0-D59.6, D59.8, D59.9). Patients with alpha and beta thalassemia were not included.

### Addressing the gaps in the vitamin B12 deficiency 2024 NICE guidelines: highlighting the need for better recognition, diagnosis, and management of pernicious anaemia [^f9695374]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2025). Medium credibility.

Whilst renaming PA as AIG can add confusion and uncertainty, the name PA has its own shortcomings, which is perhaps why NICE proposed to change it. The term 'pernicious anaemia' suggests that anaemia is a defining characteristic of the disease. However, anaemia is present in only 15–20% of PA diagnoses. Practitioners unfamiliar with PA are commonly misled by the term 'anaemia', as all ICD-10 (D51.0–9) codes for B deficiency incorrectly include the term anaemia. The term 'pernicious' is also an anachronism, predating the 1948 discovery of B as an effective treatment. It was first coined by Anton Biermer in 1871 to describe the fatal anaemia cases seen prior to the discovery of effective treatments. It is important to note that even though anaemia occurs in a minority of PA patients, this represents an important subgroup of patients that requires a different management approach. The current guidelines do not address how to specifically diagnose and manage this subgroup of patients, representing a significant gap in knowledge and warranting further research.

The definition and our understanding of the condition has evolved significantly since Biermer's original description. We now know that PA often presents with predominantly neurological symptoms. Therefore, if a name change is warranted, it should be one that better reflects the current clinical presentation of the disease.

The persistent use of the term 'pernicious anaemia' in both clinical practice (primary, secondary and tertiary care) and state-of-the-art research highlights a disconnect between these guidelines and current clinical practice. It is important to highlight that the adoption of new and more appropriate terminology would require universal acceptance by clinicians, carers and patients who would have lived with the name PA for most of their lives. While changing established medical terminology may take decades — potentially one to two generations of doctors — before it is fully adopted in clinical language, emphasising that such a change, if it were to happen, would be gradual and require effective dissemination.

However, a name change could offer significant advantages by reflecting the current understanding of PA and encouraging clinicians to investigate neurological symptoms associated with PA. This would be achieved through a concerted effort to educate doctors by incorporating this knowledge into the curriculum, which will dispel misconceptions commonly ascribed to PA patients by doctors and promote a deeper understanding of PA's complexity.

### Trends and predictions of malnutrition and obesity in 204 countries and territories: an analysis of the global burden of disease study 2019 [^5b1129d6]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Statistical analysis

The study included all cases of malnutrition and obesity within the GBD 2019 study. Malnutrition was defined based on the 10th revision International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes for nutritional deficiencies, stratified based on protein-energy malnutrition (ICD-10 codes E40-E46.9, E64.0), iodine deficiencies (E00-E02), vitamin A deficiencies (E50-E50.9, E64.1), dietary iron deficiencies (D50-D50.9), and other nutritional deficiencies such as vitamin deficiency anaemias, thiamine, niacin, vitamin D, vitamin C, calcium, selenium, and folate deficiency (D51-D53.9, E51-E61.9, E63-E64, E64.2-E64.9), with the full definitions used reported in the original GBD 2019 report. Obesity was measured by body mass index (BMI) using metrics related to national and subnational estimates, and defined as a high BMI of ≥ 25 kg/m 2.

The Joinpoint Regression Model version 4.9.1.0was used to compare annual percentage changes (APC) in rates, through which trends in obesity and malnutrition, stratified by sex, geographical location, and SDI were observed. APCs of the age-standardised rates from 2000 to 2019 were presented with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). An APC value which is large in magnitude represents an increasing (worsening) or decreasing (improving) trend.

STATA version 17.0 was used to project the obesity and malnutrition-related burden of deaths and DALYs using historical data from 2000 to 2019 to test for linear and quadratic trends. Based on visual inspection and evaluation of the models, the most appropriate model with the best fit for each disease entity was chosen. Using the predictions from the regression models and the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation projectionof population counts for years 2020–2030, we projected the burden of mortality and DALYs through to year 2030 for obesity and malnutrition. We also stratified the projections by sex for comparison. To examine the percentage change for obesity and malnutrition, the following equation was used:

The methods used to project the GBD estimates have been described previously. No sensitivity or post-hoc analyses were performed.

Ethics

The study was exempted from IRB review as the publicly available data did not contain any confidential patient information.

### Impact of data source choice on multimorbidity measurement: a comparison study of 2.3 million individuals in the Welsh national health service [^9377957b]. BMC Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Definition of long-term conditions

Choice of the 47 conditions was based on results of a recent Delphi consensus study recommending those to include in the measurement of multimorbidity (Additional file 1), and multimorbidity was defined as the presence of two or more conditions. Phenotype definition and look-back duration for the codes defining each of the conditions followed rules defined by Barnett et al. where possible. For the remaining conditions, inclusion criteria were agreed through discussion between authors CM, SWM, and BG. In certain cases, look-back durations varied within conditions to reflect the impact living with the condition was likely to have on an individual. For example, anaemia was defined as a relevant code ever recorded for aplastic anaemia, sickle cell anaemia, and thalassaemia (conditions that are either life-long or life-threatening), but as a relevant code dated in the last 12 months for iron-, B12-, or folate-deficient anaemias (conditions that are more likely to be transient), with the results of both combined into a single variable defining the presence of 'anaemia' on 1 January 2019. Unless the look-back duration was specifically stipulated, for example, 1 year for asthma clinical codes, codes present between 1 January 2000 and the study cross-section date of 1 January 2019 were used for both PC and HI data. This approach was taken to avoid relative over-ascertainment of PC codes. Historic codes are present for lifetime records that have been transcribed into the electronic record in the PC data source, but the first electronic records HI held within PEDW began on 1 April 1995. Code lists used to define conditions were those created by Kuan et al. available on the HDR UK Phenotype Library and de novo code lists created specifically by the authors of this study where required (detailed in Additional file 2). We adapted prescribing code lists from the Cambridge Multimorbidity Score by Payne et al. to qualify conditions that resolve as 'active' on 1 January 2019 (e.g. asthma, epilepsy).

Prescribing and laboratory data were available within the PC datasource (WLGP). To ensure that the study reflected a fair comparison between ascertainment using codes present in PC and HI datasets based on availability within each data source, prescribing data were applied to only PC and to linked PC-HI data. Conditions were categorised by the International Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems 10th Revision (ICD-10) (Additional file 2).

### Estimating effects of serum vitamin B12 levels on psychiatric disorders and cognitive impairment: a mendelian randomization study [^630e8103]. Communications Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Fig. 1
Associations between genetically predicted vitamin B12 and folate levels and various types of anemia.

Mendelian randomization estimates obtained using the weighted median method and the Wald ratio method are illustrated for vitamin B12 levels and folate levels, respectively. Error bars represent 95% confidence intervals. Sample sizes are available in Supplementary Data 4.

In addition, two independent genetic variants, rs1801133 and rs652197, were significantly associated with serum folate levels (p -value < 2.2 × 10 −9; Supplementary Data 1). However, rs1801133, a missense variant of MTHFR, demonstrated a high risk of horizontal pleiotropy, with known associations with N-terminal prohormone brain natriuretic peptide levels, blood pressure, and multiple blood cell characteristics (Supplementary Data 2). Meanwhile, rs652197, an intronic variant of FOLR3, has been associated with serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels in previous studies (Supplementary Data 2). As expected, the genetically predicted folate levels were also associated with a reduced odds of vitamin B12 deficiency anemia based on ICD-10 codes (OR = 0.30; 95% CI: 0.18–0.49; p -value = 2.3 × 10 −6) and self-reported pernicious anemia (OR = 0.29; 95% CI: 0.14–0.60; p -value = 9.3 × 10 − 4; Fig. 1 and Supplementary Data 4). Although folate levels were predicted to reduce the odds of folate deficiency anemia, this association was not significant, likely due to the small number of folate deficiency anemia cases (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Data 4). Given the risk of horizontal pleiotropy in the instruments for folate levels and the inapplicability of MR sensitivity analysis methods, subsequent analyses and interpretation of findings did not focus on folate levels.

### Evaluation of anemia [^bfa5fd37]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Anemia is a common problem in primary care. Classification based on mean cell volume narrows the differential diagnosis and directs testing. A marked macrocytosis is characteristic of vitamin B12 and folate deficiencies, certain medications, and primary bone marrow disorders. The three most common causes of microcytic anemia are iron deficiency, thalassemia trait, and anemia of inflammation. Additional laboratory testing is required for diagnosis. Determination of the rate of development of anemia and examination of a blood smear may provide diagnostic clues to guide more specialized testing. Diagnosis of iron, vitamin B12, or folate deficiency mandates determination of the underlying cause.

### Laboratory testing for and diagnosis of nutritional deficiencies in pregnancy before and after bariatric surgery [^e70eb60d]. Journal of Women's Health (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

Bariatric surgery can reduce the risk of obesity-related complications of pregnancy, but may cause essential nutrient deficiencies. To assess adherence to laboratory testing guidelines, we examined frequency of testing for and diagnosis of deficiency during preconception and pregnancy using claims data in women with a delivery and bariatric surgery.

Methods

Retrospective analysis of claims from seven Blue Cross/Blue Shield plans between 2002 and 2008. We included women with a delivery and bariatric surgery within the study period. We used common procedural terminology (CPT) and ICD-9 codes to define laboratory testing and deficiencies for iron, folate, vitamin B12, vitamin D, and thiamine. Using Student's t-test and chi-square testing, we compared frequency of laboratory tests and diagnoses during 12 months preconception and 280 days of pregnancy between women with pregnancy before versus after surgery. We used multivariate logistic regression to evaluate for predictors of laboratory testing.

Results

We identified 456 women with pregnancy after bariatric surgery and 338 before surgery. The frequency of testing for any deficiency was low (9%-51%), but higher in those with pregnancy after surgery (p < 0.003). The most common deficiency was vitamin B12 (12%-13%) with pregnancy after surgery (p < 0.006). Anemia and number of health provider visits were independent predictors of laboratory testing.

Conclusion

Women with pregnancy after bariatric surgery were tested for and diagnosed with micronutrient deficiencies more frequently than those with pregnancy before surgery. However, most laboratory testing occurred in less than half the women and was triggered by anemia. Increased testing may help identify nutrient deficiencies and prevent consequences for maternal and child health.

### Prevalence, years lived with disability, and trends in anaemia burden by severity and cause, 1990–2021: findings from the global burden of disease study 2021 [^074575e2]. The Lancet: Haematology (2023). High credibility.

This study has a number of limitations. First, data availability varied considerably by age and sex. Although comparatively many haemoglobin surveys exist for children older than 6 months and women of reproductive age, data are much sparser for younger children, adult males, and males and females older than 60 years. In addition, high-quality data at more granular levels to inform subnational estimation, including those subnational locations included in this analysis, are comparatively sparse. Second, WHO anaemia definitions are not available for children younger than 6 months, so we imputed thresholds based on median haemoglobin concentrations for older children; this probably imparted additional uncertainty in burden estimates beyond what is presented. Third, in our causal analysis, we assumed a linear cause-specific haemoglobin shift for any starting haemoglobin value, and we assumed that the shape of the population haemoglobin distribution was constant, which might not capture the true variation in cause-specific effects on haemoglobin distributions across geography and cause. Fourth, because the amount of data available to inform haemoglobin shifts varied substantially by cause (appendix pp 18–25) we were not able to capture uncertainty in the shifts themselves. Fifth, the assumption that each anaemia case has only a single underlying cause, although reflecting a sparsity of data to inform the interplay between diseases, nonetheless is a limitation in that many people with anaemia are likely to have multiple comorbid conditions contributing to their anaemia. Additional data on the combined effects of comorbid conditions on haemoglobin concentrations are needed to fully account for the multiple causes underlying many cases of anaemia. Finally, we were unable to capture all potential causes of anaemia in our causal analysis, owing to an absence of either estimates of disease prevalence or associated haemoglobin shifts. These potential causes include cancers, injuries, some micronutrient deficiencies (eg, folate and cobalamin), causes of inflammation not already captured in this analysis, and drug reactions. In addition, we had to estimate some causes as residual causes, again because either cause prevalence estimates or haemoglobin shifts were not available; this includes dietary iron deficiency, the largest cause of anaemia in our analyses.

### Folate [^66fd7b29]. Advances in Nutrition (2013). Low credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on folate deficiency:

- **Definition**: Folate deficiency is dietary folate equivalents < 400 mcg/day in adults and < 600 mcg/day in pregnant women characterized by megaloblastic anemia, and risk of neural tube defects and congenital anomalies.
- **Pathophysiology**: Folate deficiency is mostly caused by inadequate folate intake, pregnancy and lactation, alcoholism, gene polymorphism (C1561T), and certain medications (methotrexate, anticonvulsants, sufasalazine, pyrimethamine).
- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence of folate deficiency anemia in the US adults is estimated at < 0.1%.
- **Disease course**: Clinical manifestations include megaloblastic anemia and increased incidence of various cancers (colorectal, prostate, and breast cancer). Pregnancy-related complications include neural tube defects) spina bifida, anencephaly), and other congenital anomalies (congenital heart defects, oral cleft lip and palate) in neonates, maternal megaloblastic anemia, low infant birth weight, stillbirth, and premature delivery.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Folate deficiency is associated with increased all-cause mortality with a hazard ratio of 1.33 (95% CI 1.01–1.76).

### Intraoperative risk factors of acute kidney injury after liver transplantation [^974ba277]. Liver Transplantation (2022). Medium credibility.

Covariates

In the MPOG database, data are stored, validated, and extracted for quality improvement and research purposes. From the combined data set, we curated 107 covariates that were grouped as (1) demographic, (2) procedural, (3) etiology of liver failure, (4) donor/graft‐specific factors, (5) preoperative laboratory studies, and (6) intraoperative data (Table S1). Intraoperative measures included vasopressor/inotropic support, mean arterial pressure (MAP), resuscitation with blood products and fluids, and laboratory studies. Intraoperative variables were also classified according to the following stages of transplantation to enable additional phase‐specific modeling: (1) dissection, (2) anhepatic phase, and (3) reperfusion phase. Laboratory and vital sign values were quantified as a time‐weighted average over the entire window, assuming the most recent result as current, until a new value is documented. Medication and transfusion values were calculated as total administration during the phase of interest. Recipient comorbidities were curated from a combination of diagnostic codes, standardized entry in the history and physical evaluation perfomed preoperatively by the anesthesia provider, and free‐text search for relevant terminology. Diagnostic codes were grouped according to a previously validated approach. Examples include (1) preoperative anemia (defined as iron deficiency or folate and B12 deficiencies) and (2) preoperative electrolyte/acid‐base balance disorders (defined as syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion or various electrolyte and acid/base disorders). (Electrolyte/acid‐base balance disorders are based on the Elixhauser Comorbidity Index, which is positive if the patient has International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision [ICD‐9]/International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision [ICD‐10] diagnosis codes for syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion [ICD‐9 253.6x and ICD‐10 E22.2x] or various electrolyte and acid/base disorders [ICD‐9 276 and 276.x and ICD‐10 E86.x, E87.x, E88.x], where x is any digit.) In addition, we calculated time‐weighted averages of physiologic measures taken throughout the LT process. Finally, we adjusted for preoperative (baseline) estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) calculated using the MDRD‐4.

### Association between folic acid prescription fills and suicide attempts and intentional self-harm among privately insured US adults [^39bfd9d2]. JAMA Psychiatry (2022). High credibility.

Importance

Suicide is a leading cause of death in the United States, having increased more than 30% from 2000 to 2018. An inexpensive, safe, widely available treatment for preventing suicidal behavior could reverse this trend.

Objective

To confirm a previous signal for decreased risk of suicide attempt following prescription fills for folic acid in a national pharmacoepidemiologic study of patients treated with folic acid.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A within-person exposure-only cohort design was used to study the dynamic association between folic acid (vitamin B9) prescription fills over a 24-month period and suicide attempts and intentional self-harm. Data were collected from a pharmacoepidemiologic database of US medical claims (MarketScan) for patients with private health insurance who filled a folic acid prescription between 2012 and 2017. The same analysis was repeated with a control supplement (cyanocobalamin, vitamin B12). Data were analyzed from August 2021 to June 2022.

Exposure

Folic acid prescription fills.

Main Outcome and Measure

Suicide attempt or intentional self-harm resulting in an outpatient visit or inpatient admission as identified by codes from the International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Ninth and Tenth Revisions, Clinical Modification.

Results

Data on 866 586 patients were collected; 704 514 (81.30%) were female, and 90 296 (10.42%) were 60 years and older. Overall, there were 261 suicidal events during months covered by a folic acid prescription (5 521 597 person-months) for a rate of 4.73 per 100 000 person-months, compared with 895 suicidal events during months without folic acid (8 432 340) for a rate of 10.61 per 100 000 person-months. Adjusting for age and sex, diagnoses related to suicidal behavior, diagnoses related to folic acid deficiency, folate-reducing medications, history of folate-reducing medications, and history of suicidal events, the hazard ratio (HR) for folic acid for suicide events was 0.56 (95% CI, 0.48–0.65), with similar results for the modal dosage of 1 mg of folic acid per day (HR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.48–0.69) and women of childbearing age (HR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.50–0.73). A duration-response analysis (1-mg dosage) revealed a 5% decrease in suicidal events per month of additional treatment (HR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.93–0.97). The same analysis for the negative control, cyanocobalamin, found no association with suicide attempt (HR, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.80–1.27).

Conclusions and Relevance

This large-scale pharmacoepidemiologic study of folic acid found a beneficial association in terms of lower rates of suicide attempts. The results warrant the conduct of a randomized clinical trial with suicidal ideation and behavior as outcomes of interest. If confirmed, folic acid may be a safe, inexpensive, and widely available treatment for suicidal ideation and behavior.

Methods

Study population

South Korea has a universal health insurance system, into which approximately 98% of all citizens are enrolled. We used a dataset, Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service - Pediatric Patient Sample, (HIRA-PPS-2016), that randomly stratified 10% of the pediatric patients (~ 1,100,000) under 20 years of age who used a medical institution during the year 2016. HIRA reported that almost 90% of Koreans visit medical institutions at least once a year. In South Korea, health care providers report diagnostic codes when prescribing a medication or procedure, and patients are required to physically visit their physician to receive prescriptions. Thus, the requirement of diagnostic codes and absence of refill and telemedicine models results in a dataset with no missing diagnostic codes in the claim data.

The inclusion criterion in this study was patient age under 18 years. Exclusion criteria for this study were: 1) patients who were diagnosed with an anemia other than IDA, 2) patients who were diagnosed with two or more types of anemia. We chose IDA to evaluate if inflammation of atopic diseases increases the prevalence of anemia since the hematologic characteristics of IDA is similar with anemia of inflammation (AI). In addition, other types of anemia except IDA, such as hemolytic anemia, aplastic anemia or folate deficiency anemia, were excluded in this study because of their low prevalence and different mechanisms of etiology. Diagnosis of AI was very low prevalence in children and used for patients with specific chronic condition such as CKD or cancer, so it was also excluded in this study.

Definition of diseases

We included atopic dermatitis, allergic rhinitis, and asthma as atopic disease based on the presence of the diagnostic code corresponding to one or more of these diseases. Diagnostic codes for these diseases and covariate diseases (see below) are based on The Korean Standard Classification of Disease and Cause of Death-7 (KCD-7) was used for definition of disease (Additional file 1: Table S1). The KCD-7 reflects the update of the International Classification of Diseases 10th Revision (ICD-10) and refines the Korean subtypes of disease and rare diseases.

### Post-bariatric surgery lab tests: are they excessive and redundant? [^3ae9a7e5]. Surgical Endoscopy (2020). Medium credibility.

Dependent variable

We identified nine nutritional labs of interest (copper, ferritin, folate, iron binding capacity, Vitamin A, Vitamin B1, Vitamin B12, Vitamin D, and zinc) that could have up to six values for the two years following bariatric surgery. These nine dependent variables were binary, coded as 1 indicating nutritional deficiency, because it is assumed that the probability of an event occurring is P (Y = 1). Grouped logistic regression takes into account the count of the total results from a varying number of attempts. Therefore, the dependent variable (DV) numerator was the summed count of labs that were outside the defined threshold, respective to each of the nine lab tests, and the DV denominator was the count of total lab results across all nine labs. The same data without summation were used in the individual GEE logistic regression models.

Independent variables

Preoperative nutritional deficiencies

Given the relationship between preoperative nutritional deficiencies and post-bariatric occurrence of nutritional deficiencies, our main independent variable of interest was a binary measure of preoperative lab deficiency. For the grouped logit model, we defined this variable as deficient if one or more of the nine preoperative lab results were deficient/outside the set threshold. If there were no postoperative lab results available for any individual nutrient, the preoperative value was redefined as 'missing' to exclude preoperative deficiencies that did not have a postoperative match. A count of deficiencies across the nine nutrition variables was created and used to create the binary preoperative deficiency, defined as one or more preoperative nutritional deficiencies.

Comorbidities and medical history

Each of the 17 conditions defined by the Charlson Index were examined for potential model inclusion through univariate analyses; these variables were created at patient level using specified ICD-10 codes. Renal failure and diabetes were included in the model. The Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery Accreditation and Quality Improvement Program (MBSAQIP) offered additional comorbidities, specifically hypertension (defined by the use of hypertension medications), hyperlipidemia, and previous surgery.

KDIGO anemia in chronic kidney disease — vitamin B12 and folate testing notes these are uncommon but treatable causes of anemia linked to macrocytosis and low red blood cell (RBC) indices, with limited data indicating the prevalence is ≤ 10% of hemodialysis patients and unknown in CKD. Because these deficiencies are easily correctable and vitamin B12 deficiency may signal other disease processes, assessment of folate and vitamin B12 levels are generally considered standard components of anemia evaluation, especially with macrocytosis. Folate deficiency is best detected with serum folate testing, and RBC folate can be measured when serum levels are equivocal or recent dietary intake may obscure deficiency using serum levels alone.

### Anemia [^3a57a1ea]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

Anemia is an enormous problem worldwide that is worse in the developing countries but by no means lacking in developed countries. Women and children are disproportionately affected. Nutritional anemias, mainly caused by a lack of iron and folate, are largely correctable by dietary improvement, but this socioeconomic change may not be readily achieved. The inherited disorders, the hemoglobinopathies and thalassemias, in their heterozygous forms are beneficial to the affected populations. Prevention of the homozygous forms and the serious diseases that result can only be addressed by education. These conditions are seen in all types of medical practice ranging from neonatology to geriatrics and public health and are an ongoing concern to all physicians.

### Effect of folic acid food fortification in Canada on congenital heart disease subtypes [^2d3798ee]. Circulation (2016). Low credibility.

Case Ascertainment and Classification of CHDs

Up to fiscal year 2000 to 2001, diagnoses in the Discharge Abstract Database were coded according to the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9), with the Tenth Revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems for Diagnoses (ICD-10) being adopted by Canadian hospitals in 2001 to 2002. The validity of information in the Discharge Abstract Database is assessed continually through abstraction and other studies. These studies show that the diagnosis of CHDs is accurate and that the transition of the coding system from ICD-9 to ICD-10 did not materially affect the coding of CHDs.

CHDs among all live births, stillbirths (including pregnancy terminations), and infants readmitted in the first year after birth were ascertained by the use of ICD-9 codes for diagnoses from 1990 to 2001 to 2002 (745.0–747.9), after which ICD-10 codes (Q20.0–Q26.9) were used. All CHD cases were then classified into the following 6 categories by grouping ICD codes in hierarchical fashion, as previously proposed –,: (1) conotruncal defects consisting of common truncus (745.0/Q20.0 and Q21.4), transposition of great vessels (745.1/Q20.1-Q20.3 and Q20.5), and tetralogy of Fallot (745.2/Q21.3); (2) nonconotruncal defects including endocardial cushion defects (745.6/Q21.2), common ventricle (745.3/Q20.4), and hypoplastic left heart syndrome (746.7/Q23.4); (3) coarctation of the aorta (747.1/Q25.1); (4) ventricular septal defect (745.4/Q21.0 and Q21.8); (5) atrial septal defect (745.5/Q21.1), and (6) other heart and circulatory system anomalies (ie, ICD codes for CHDs excluding the above-mentioned 5 categories). The first 3 categories made up the severe CHD subtypes. Pregnancy terminations resulting from congenital anomalies were included among stillbirths, although they could not be identified separately until 1997 in our data source.

### Prevalence of appropriate testing for incident anemia in the US department of veterans affairs [^c261dc6c]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Methods

The US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is the largest national integrated health care system and has robust laboratory and administrative data. We defined a national retrospective cohort among patients who received regular VA care (≥ 2 primary care visits in 2 years) and had incident anemia, defined by: (1) 2 or more normal hemoglobin (Hb) levels between January 1, 2013, and December 31, 2014; and (2) followed by anemia on 2 laboratory studies within 6 months of each other. The World Health Organization criteria were used for Hb levels: less than 12 g/dL for women and less than 13 g/dL for men (to convert Hb to grams per liter, multiply by 10). Patients were excluded if they were hospitalized within the 90 days before the incident date, or had laboratory evidence of anemia in the 5 years before the baseline (last normal) Hb level.

The primary outcome was appropriate testing within 1 year. Testing consisted of iron studies (ferritin, iron saturation, or both) in patients with microcytic anemia (mean corpuscular volume, < 80 μm 3 [to convert to femtoliters, multiply by 1]); vitamin B 12 and folate studies in patients with macrocytic anemia (mean corpuscular volume, > 100 μm 3); iron studies (ferritin, iron saturation, or both); and vitamin B 12 and folate studies in patients with normocytic anemia (mean corpuscular volume, 80–100 μm 3). Anemia was classified as mild, moderate, or severe using World Health Organization criteria (mild, Hb ≥ 11 g/dL; moderate, Hb ≥ 8 but < 11 g/dL; or severe, Hb < 8 g/dL). Iron deficiency anemia was determined using established likelihood ratios of ferritin. For incident IDA among patients who did not undergo esophagogastroduodenoscopy or colonoscopy in the preceding 2 years, we determined the proportion of patients who underwent endoscopic evaluation within the next year.

The VA Ann Arbor Healthcare System institutional review board approved the study and waived informed consent because the study posed minimal risk to participants and was not feasible without a waiver. This study followed the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology reporting guideline. Race was reported using patient-reported classifications. A 2-sided P < .05 was considered statistically significant. We used χ 2 and Fisher exact tests for analysis of the categorical variables. Statistical analysis was performed using SAS, version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc).

Evaluation of related anemia — Major morbidities of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) include symptomatic anemia and associated fatigue; the health care provider must also identify and treat any coexisting causes of anemia, and standard assessments should be performed to look for gastrointestinal bleeding, hemolysis, renal disease, and nutritional deficiency. If needed, iron, folate, or vitamin B12 studies should be obtained and the cause of depletion corrected, if possible, after which further consideration for treating MDS-related anemia should be undertaken. Anemia related to MDS commonly presents as a hypoproductive macrocytic anemia, often associated with suboptimal elevation of sEPO levels, and bone marrow aspiration with iron stain, biopsy, and cytogenetics should be used to determine WHO subtype, iron status, and the level of RS.

### Severity of anemia during pregnancy and adverse maternal and fetal outcomes [^20f3d377]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Definition of Variables

Exposure

Anemia during pregnancy (not puerperium), including mild anemia (hemoglobin concentration, 100–109 g/L), moderate anemia (hemoglobin concentration, 70–99 g/L), and severe anemia (hemoglobin concentration, < 70 g/L), was identified using the relevant ICD-10 codes (eTable 4 in the Supplement). Pregnant females with a diagnosis of anemia that could not be differentiated by severity with ICD-10 codes were classified separately as having anemia of unknown severity.

Maternal and Fetal Outcomes

The maternal outcomes identified using ICD-9-CM or ICD-10 codes included placental abruption, preterm birth (delivery before 37 weeks' gestation), cesarean delivery, severe postpartum hemorrhage (females with ICD-9-CM or ICD-10 codes of postpartum hemorrhage who were treated with blood transfusion or hysterectomy), shock, admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), and maternal death during hospital delivery. Fetal outcomes included growth restriction, malformation (congenital malformations, deformations, and chromosomal abnormalities diagnosed during hospitalization), and stillbirth (death before or during delivery after 20 weeks of pregnancy) (eTable 4 in the Supplement).

Complications During Pregnancy

Complications during pregnancy for which the time sequence relative to onset of anemia was unknown but that might have been associated with outcomes were identified as confounding variables using ICD-9-CM or ICD-10 codes. These included in vitro fertilization, multiple pregnancies, hypertension disorders, diabetes, thyroid diseases, circulatory diseases, urinary diseases, respiratory diseases, digestive diseases, coagulation disorders, scarred uterus, placenta accreta spectrum, placenta previa, antepartum hemorrhage, intrauterine infection, abnormal amniotic fluid, cervical incompetence, and abnormal placenta.

Tell your doctor if you have: kidney problems, thyroid disease. This medication should be used as directed during pregnancy or while breast-feeding. Consult your doctor. Administration of folate alone is improper therapy for pernicious anemia and other megaloblastic anemias in which vitamin B12 is deficient.

Precautions

Folate in doses above 0.1 mg daily may obscure pernicious anemia, in that hematologic remission can occur while neurological manifestations remain progressive. There is a potential danger in administering folate to patients with undiagnosed anemia, since folate may obscure the diagnosis of pernicious anemia by alleviating the hematologic manifestations of the disease while allowing the neurologic complications to progress. This may result in severe nervous system damage before the correct diagnosis is made. The patient's medical conditions and consumption of other drugs, herbs, and/or supplements should be considered.

### ICD-10 code validation for gastrointestinal bleeding in patients receiving oral anticoagulation: nationwide cohort study [^497523c3]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

The relatively poor sensitivity of the GIB coding algorithm was not unexpected given the many ICD-10 codes that can be used to code for GIB and may be due to a combination of factors. First, patients may have received nonspecific ICD-10 codes, such as iron-deficiency anemia or diverticular disease. Second, patients may have had GIB during their admission without it being their main complaint, and in that case the patient may only have been assigned ICD-10 codes related to their main complaint. Supporting this, the GIB events that the algorithm missed were not as severe as the events that it identified.

The study has several strengths. It is nationwide, including all the major hospitals in Iceland and uses a "catch-all" method to identify GIB events, with manual review of all events. Additionally, OAC use was identified using a national drug prescription database, that includes data on all outpatient drug prescriptions in the country. Therefore, the study essentially includes all clinically relevant GIB events for patients on OAC over a 5-year period.

The study also has several limitations. First, although the study included data from all the major hospitals in Iceland, the Icelandic population is relatively homogenous and the results may not be generalizable to other more heterogenous populations. Second, although the study included 745 true GIB events, it may not have sufficient statistical power to estimate the accuracy of some of the less commonly used ICD-10 codes. For example, the code for gastrojejunal ulcer, K28, was only used once in our cohort. Third, the ICD-10 coding algorithm described herein was validated in OAC users and may not be applicable to other populations.

Methods

Data source

Data were retrospectively collected from the administrative databases of a sample of Italian Healthcare Departments, geographically distributed across the Country and covering around 9.3 million health-assisted individuals. These databases are large repositories of information to be used for reimbursement purposes regarding all healthcare services provided by the INHS, which is funded on the principle of universal coverage of healthcare expenses for all national and legal foreign residents. For the current study, Italian Healthcare Departments database were selected by their geographical distribution, by data completeness, and by the high-quality linked datasets. Specifically, data linkage was performed among the following databases: (1) demographic database, which collects patients' demographic as gender, age and date of death; (2) pharmaceuticals database, which collects information regarding medicinal products reimbursed by the INHS, namely the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) code, number of packages, number of units per package, unit cost per package, and prescription date; (3) hospitalization database, which contains all data related hospitalizations, like discharge diagnosis codes classified according to the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM), Diagnosis Related Group (DRG) and DRG-related charge (provided by the INHS); (4) outpatient specialist services database, which contains all information about diagnostic tests and specialist visits (date and type of service delivery, activity description and tariff for laboratory test or specialist visit); (5) exemption database, gathering all payment waiver codes that exempt patients from contribution charge for services/treatments in case of specific disease diagnoses. The reporting of this study conforms to the STrengthening the Reporting of OBservational studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) statement.

To guarantee patients' privacy, an anonymous univocal numeric code was assigned to each subject included in the study, in full compliance with the European General Data Protection Regulation (2016/679). The patient code in each database allowed electronic linkage between all different databases. The results are exclusively in aggregated form and are not attributable to a single institution, department, doctor, individual, or individual prescribing behavior. Based on the Data Privacy Guarantor Authority (General Authorization for personal data treatment for scientific research purposes — n.9/2014), informed consent was not required, as the data collected were anonymized and could not be linked to individual patient identification.

Disease definitions

Protein-energy malnutrition (PEM) includes moderate and severe acute malnutrition, commonly referred to as "wasting", and was defined in terms of weight-for-height Z-scores (WHZ) on the World Health Organization (WHO) 2006 growth standard for children. PEM was quantified in four categories: moderate wasting without oedema (WHZ < -2SD to < -3 SD), moderate wasting with oedema (WHZ < -2SD to < -3 SD), severe wasting without oedema (WHZ < -3SD), and severe wasting with oedema (WHZ < -3SD). The GBD team further uses the DisMod-MR 2.1 model to ensure consistent applicability of the assessment across all age groups. For PEM, ICD 10 codes are E40-E46.9, E64.0, and ICD 9 codes are 260–263.9. In the GBD 2021, the non-fatal burden of iodine deficiency includes estimates of only the subset of iodine deficiency associated with visible goitre (grade 2) and its associated sequelae, including thyroid dysfunction, heart failure, and intellectual disability, excluding sub-clinical iodine deficiency or non-visible goitre (grade 1) induced by iodine deficiency. For iodine deficiency, ICD-10 codes are E00-E02 and ICD-9 codes are 244.2. Vitamin A deficiency was defined as the prevalence of serum retinol concentration < 0.7 µmol/L, according to ICD 10 codes E50-E50.9, E64.1, and ICD 9 codes 264–264.9. Dietary iron deficiency is defined as mild, moderate, or severe anaemia that is the result of inadequate dietary intake of iron, but not due to other causes of inadequate absolute or functional iron availability to meet the body's needs. For dietary iron deficiency, ICD 10 codes are D50-D50.9, and ICD 9 codes are 280–280.9.

### Approach to anaemia in gastrointestinal disease: a position paper by the ESPGHAN gastroenterology committee [^be11a05b]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2025). Medium credibility.

3 DEFINITION OF ANAEMIA

3.1 Recommendation

The definition of anaemia in children with GI disease should be based on validated World Health Organization (WHO) criteria (level of evidence [LoE]: low; strength of recommendation [SoR]: strong, voting: 100% agreement).

3.1.1 Statement

In children with GI disease, anaemia can be classified based on pathogenic mechanisms, red cell morphology and clinical presentation (LoE: low; SoR: strong, voting: 100% agreement).

3.1.2 Practice points

1 Vitamin B12 and/or folic acid deficiency, iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) and anaemia of chronic disease (ACD) may cause hyporegenerative anaemia.
2 IDA is diagnosed in the presence of ferritin < 30 or < 100 μg/L in the absence/presence of active disease, respectively.
3 ACD is multifactorial and associated with the presence of infection or inflammation.
4 Anaemia can be classified as acute or chronic according to the clinical presentation.

3.2 Summary of evidence

Anaemia is a public health problem affecting both high‐ and low‐income countries. Approximately one quarter of the world's population (almost 2 billion people) suffers from anaemia, with 39.8% of children < 5 years of age affected, equivalent to 269 million children, and with the highest prevalence rate (60.2%) observed in children living in the African region. The WHO estimates that the global prevalence of anaemia in children aged 6–59 months in European and North American children is 20.3% and 6.1%, respectively.

Anaemia is defined by a haemoglobin (Hb) level or red cell mass below the range considered normal for age and gender, which results in decreased oxygen‐carrying capacity to the body's tissues. The normal range of Hb varies with age, gender and race, and therefore, specified thresholds should be considered for diagnosis (Table 1). Anaemia can be classified based on pathogenesis, red cell morphology, and clinical presentation (Table 2). Regarding the pathogenic mechanisms, these are represented by inadequate production and loss of erythrocytes due to either bleeding or haemolysis. Based on these mechanisms, anaemia can be further subdivided into (a) hypo‐regenerative, with a decreased bone marrow production from impaired function, decreased number of precursor cells, reduced stem cell density, or lack of nutrients; and (b) regenerative, with an appropriate bone marrow response to a reduced erythrocyte mass, characterised by increased production of erythrocytes.

### Severity of anemia during pregnancy and adverse maternal and fetal outcomes [^9013cda5]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Importance

Anemia is the most widespread nutritional deficiency among pregnant females in the world. Despite numerous studies on anemia, evidence is limited about the association of severity of anemia with maternal and fetal health.

Objective

To investigate the association between severity of anemia during pregnancy and risk of maternal and fetal adverse outcomes.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This retrospective cohort study used data from China's Hospital Quality Monitoring System from January 1, 2016, to December 31, 2019, for pregnant females aged 15 to 49 years with birth outcomes reported at 1508 hospitals with maternity services in mainland China.

Exposures

Anemia of varying severity during pregnancy was identified from daily standardized electronic inpatient discharge records using corresponding codes of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision. Mild anemia was defined as a hemoglobin concentration of 100 to 109 g/L (to convert g/L to g/dL, divide by 10.0); moderate anemia, as 70 to 99 g/L; and severe anemia, as less than 70 g/L.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The main outcomes included 6 maternal outcomes (placental abruption, preterm birth, severe postpartum hemorrhage, shock, admission to the intensive care unit [ICU], and maternal mortality) and 3 neonatal outcomes (fetal growth restriction, malformation, and stillbirth). Multivariable logistic regression models were used to estimate the odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs of these outcomes among pregnant females with varying severity of anemia.

Results

Among 18 948 443 pregnant females aged 15 to 49 years (mean [SD] age, 29.42 [4.87] years), 17.78% were diagnosed with anemia during pregnancy, including 9.04% with mild anemia, 2.62% with moderate anemia, 0.21% with severe anemia, and 5.90% with anemia of unknown severity. Compared with no anemia, anemia severity during pregnancy was associated with increased risks of placental abruption (mild: adjusted OR [aOR], 1.36 [95% CI, 1.34–1.38]; moderate: aOR, 1.98 [95% CI, 1.93–2.02]; severe: aOR, 3.35 [95% CI, 3.17–3.54]), preterm birth (mild: aOR, 1.08 [95% CI, 1.07–1.08]; moderate: aOR, 1.18 [95% CI, 1.17–1.19]; severe: aOR, 1.36 [95% CI, 1.32–1.41]), severe postpartum hemorrhage (mild: aOR, 1.45 [95% CI, 1.43–1.47]; moderate: aOR, 3.53 [95% CI, 3.47–3.60]; severe: 15.65 [95% CI, 15.10–16.22]), and fetal malformation (mild: aOR, 1.15 [95% CI, 1.14–1.17]; moderate: aOR, 1.19 [95% CI, 1.16–1.21]; severe: aOR, 1.62 [95% CI, 1.52–1.73]). Compared with no anemia, moderate or severe anemia were associated with increased risks of maternal shock (moderate: aOR, 1.50 [95% CI, 1.41–1.60]; severe: aOR, 14.98 [95% CI, 13.91–16.13]), ICU admission (moderate: aOR, 1.08 [95% CI, 1.01–1.16]; severe: aOR, 2.88 [95% CI, 2.55–3.25]), maternal death (moderate: aOR, 0.45 [95% CI, 0.30–0.65]; severe: aOR, 1.56 [95% CI, 0.97–2.48], fetal growth restriction (moderate: aOR, 0.80 [95% CI, 0.78–0.82]; severe: aOR, 1.08 [95% CI, 1.00–1.17]), and stillbirth (moderate: aOR,0.79 [95% CI, 0.76–0.81]; severe: aOR, 1.86 [95% CI, 1.75–1.98]), and mild anemia was associated with decreased risks (maternal shock: aOR, 0.67 [95% CI, 0.63–0.71]; ICU admission: aOR, 0.80 [95% CI, 0.76–0.84]; maternal death: aOR, 0.37 [95% CI, 0.29–0.49]; fetal growth restriction: aOR, 0.79 [95% CI, 0.77–0.80]; stillbirth: aOR, 0.59 [95% CI, 0.58–0.61]) after adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics and other complications during pregnancy.

Conclusions and Relevance

The findings suggest that anemia during pregnancy is associated with maternal and fetal health outcomes and that mild anemia is associated with improved maternal and fetal survival and fetal growth. Further work is needed to validate the concentration of hemoglobin at which optimal maternal and fetal health are achieved.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for iron deficiency anemia, more specifically with respect to diagnostic criteria, BSG 2021 guidelines recommend to recognize that a good response to iron therapy (hemoglobin rise ≥ 10 g/L within a 2-week timeframe) in anemic patients is highly suggestive of absolute iron deficiency, even if the results of iron studies are equivocal.

### Association of prenatal maternal anemia with neurodevelopmental disorders [^0259a2ec]. JAMA Psychiatry (2019). High credibility.

Case Ascertainment

International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, and DSM-IV codes and information from the Prescription Drug Register (for ADHD medication) were used in previously described, case ascertainment procedures that covered all inpatient and outpatient pathways to care in Stockholm County (eTable 2 in the Supplement), with follow-up until December 31, 2016. We considered 3 potentially overlapping outcomes: any ASD, any ADHD, and any ID (Figure 1 B). We also considered 5 mutually exclusive outcomes: ASD only (no ADHD or ID), ADHD only (no ASD or ID), ID without ASD (no ASD, not excluding ADHD), ASD with ID (not excluding ADHD), and ASD with ADHD (no ID) (Figure 1 C).

Anemia

Maternal anemia was defined as an International Classification of Diseases –coded diagnosis of anemia complicating pregnancy or iron deficiency anemia (eTable 2 in the Supplement) registered up to 1 calendar year before the birth of the index person, recorded in the Medical Birth Register and the National Patient Register. Anemia diagnosis during the periconceptual period was included because it likely indicates exposure to iron deficiency during early gestation. Hemoglobin level is screened a minimum of 3 times throughout pregnancy (at approximately gestational weeks 10, 25, and 37), with additional measurements if indicated.

To determine critical windows of exposure, the earliest date of anemia diagnosis was considered relative to the gestational day of pregnancy. Gestational week at diagnosis could not be established for 1286 women (4.2% of women who received an anemia diagnosis). Maternal and child characteristics were similar for those missing a diagnosis date compared with those for whom a date was established (eTable 3 in the Supplement).

### Anemia in children with inflammatory bowel disease: a position paper by the IBD committee of the north American society of pediatric gastroenterology, hepatology and nutrition [^6b712fe2]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2020). High credibility.

Pathophysiology and causes of anemia in inflammatory bowel disease — Anemia most often occurs because of a combination of chronic inflammation (anemia of chronic disease) and iron deficiency, with iron deficiency arising from inadequate iron intake, excessive blood loss, poor iron absorption, and inflammation-driven blockage in reutilization of stored iron; additional contributors include vitamin B12 and folate deficiency, hemolysis, or myelosuppression from IBD drugs; iron absorption occurs at intestinal enterocytes mainly in the duodenum and dietary nonheme iron from plants and fortified foods is released in the ferric form (Fe3+); causes summarized include most common causes (iron deficiency, anemia of chronic disease, combined iron deficiency and chronic disease), vitamin deficiency (vitamin B12 deficiency, folate deficiency, possible vitamin A, D, B6, copper), drug-induced (mercaptopurine: bone marrow suppression, myelodysplasia; methotrexate: folate deficiency, bone marrow suppression; sulfasalazine: folate deficiency, bone marrow suppression, hemolysis), immune-mediated hemolysis, and inherited causes (hemoglobinopathy, disorders of erythropoiesis, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency).

### Guidance for systematic integration of undernutrition in attributing cause of death in children [^0345113c]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

OBJECTIVES AND APPROACH

Three members of the MITS Alliance Cause of Death technical working group convened a multidisciplinary panel of experts in public health, child health, child nutrition, infectious disease, and MITS. The group met via videoconference 10 times from May 2020 to May 2021. The following objectives were delineated and provided structure for guidance development:

Objective 1: Establish parameters for when severe and moderate wasting and stunting in children 1–59 months old should be included in death certification and under what circumstances the condition should be included in part 1 (causal chain) or in part 2 (contributing condition).
Objective 2: Generate a framework for how to account for low birth weight (LBW), prematurity, and small for gestational age (SGA) as contributing or causal conditions of wasting in deaths among 1–3-month-old infants.
Objective 3: Standardize methods for using postmortem anthropometric assessments, especially in the context of limited antemortem data, to identify wasting and stunting.

We strove to align guidance development with the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems Tenth Revision (ICD-10). Although the 11 th revision, ICD-11, has been released, widespread implementation is not anticipated until 2022. The panel therefore chose to use ICD-10 to support immediate application in MITS studies. However, we anticipate full applicability of the guidance with ICD-11; sample code mapping is provided in Table 2.

Table 2.
Mapping Conditions to ICD-10 and ICD-11 Codes

A constraint in using ICD codes is their lack of consistent alignment with current terminology used to describe undernutrition, and the rules are insufficiently nuanced to reflect current understanding of causes of undernutrition. For example, ICD-10 rules for the E40–E43 undernutrition codes state that these codes are not be used in the following situations: intestinal malabsorption, nutritional anemia, starvation, or as a sequalae of protein-energy malnutrition. Undernutrition is caused by multiple, often simultaneously occurring factors, including insufficient dietary intake, enteric dysfunction, and recurrent and persistent infections. Isolating the underlying determinants of undernutrition in an individual child is usually impossible. However, because ICD-10 codes are the recommended standard for classifying conditions in the WHO International Form of Medical Certificate of Cause of Death (Figure 1), we tried to align as closely as possible to ICD-10.

Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) related anemia — evaluation and initial workup: Standard assessments should be performed to look for other causes of anemia, including GI bleeding, hemolysis, renal disease, and nutritional deficiency. If needed, iron, folate, or vitamin B12 studies should be obtained and corrected if depleted, after which further consideration for treating MDS-related anemia should be undertaken. Anemia related to MDS commonly presents as a hypoproliferative macrocytic anemia, often associated with suboptimal elevation of sEPO levels. Bone marrow aspiration with iron stain, biopsy, and cytogenetics should be used to determine WHO subtype, iron status, and the level of RS.

### Multivitamin (inflamex) [^4c9b6669]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Warnings:

Tell your doctor if you have: kidney problems, thyroid disease. This medication should be used as directed during pregnancy or while breast-feeding. Consult your doctor. Administration of folate alone is improper therapy for pernicious anemia and other megaloblastic anemias in which vitamin B12 is deficient.

Precautions:

Folate in doses above 0.1 mg daily may obscure pernicious anemia, in that hematologic remission can occur while neurological manifestations remain progressive. There is a potential danger in administering folate to patients with undiagnosed anemia since folate may obscure the diagnosis of pernicious anemia by alleviating the hematologic manifestations of the disease while allowing the neurologic complications to progress. This may result in severe nervous system damage before the correct diagnosis is made. The patient's medical conditions and consumption of other drugs, herbs, and/or supplements should be considered.

### Iron deficiency in 78 805 people admitted with heart failure across england: a retrospective cohort study [^4132e3f0]. Open Heart (2020). Medium credibility.

For the present study, codes utilised to define HF, ID or IDA were from the 10 th revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-10). There are 71 ICD-10 codes specifying the clinical spectrum of anaemia. Clinical coders cannot assume the patient has ID or IDA unless so documented in the clinical record by the responsible clinician, and they are not permitted to independently interpret test results of any kind. As defined in the national clinical coding standards,'iron deficiency' is an Essential Modifier which requires that IDA must be extant in the clinical record for the applicable codes to be assigned. If IDA is not formally recorded in a form interpretable by coders, the coding rules stipulate that the diagnosis must be coded as D649: anaemia, unspecified. For this study, the ICD-10 codes used to differentiate HF patients with or without ID or IDA are listed in table 1. Consistent with the coding convention described above, we also included ICD-10 code D649 within the IDA coding envelope, anticipating that a proportion of HF patients with IDA would be assigned that diagnostic code given the expected variation in documentation and resultant coding practice.

Table 1
ICD-10 codes used to identify patients with HF with or without ID/IDA

Study population

Iron deficiency was highlighted in the updated ESC HF guidelines of June 2016. Aware that this publication might engender transient changes in clinical practice and introduce random error, we elected to assess HES data for the financial year April 2015 through March 2016. This evaluation relates to all adult men and women admitted over that period for whom HF was coded as the primary discharge diagnosis, with possible recording of ID or IDA in any of 19 subsidiary diagnostic coding positions.

Mindful that in a higher proportion of younger people, HF would stem from cyanotic congenital heart disease with secondary polycythaemia, a distinctive disruption of iron homeostasis which might disproportionately confound assessment of ID or IDA compared with the general HF population, we chose to define adulthood as21 years. In accepting this compromise, data on only 41 patients aged 18 to 20 years admitted over the above period were excluded from study evaluation.

### Iron deficiency and other types of anemia in infants and children [^89912ded]. American Family Physician (2016). Low credibility.

Anemia, defined as a hemoglobin level two standard deviations below the mean for age, is prevalent in infants and children worldwide. The evaluation of a child with anemia should begin with a thorough history and risk assessment. Characterizing the anemia as microcytic, normocytic, or macrocytic based on the mean corpuscular volume will aid in the workup and management. Microcytic anemia due to iron deficiency is the most common type of anemia in children. The American Academy of Pediatrics and the World Health Organization recommend routine screening for anemia at 12 months of age; the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force found insufficient evidence to assess the benefits vs. harms of screening. Iron deficiency anemia, which can be associated with cognitive issues, is prevented and treated with iron supplements or increased intake of dietary iron. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force found insufficient evidence to recommend screening or treating pregnant women for iron deficiency anemia to improve maternal or neonatal outcomes. Delayed cord clamping can improve iron status in infancy, especially for at-risk populations, such as those who are preterm or small for gestational age. Normocytic anemia may be caused by congenital membranopathies, hemoglobinopathies, enzymopathies, metabolic defects, and immune-mediated destruction. An initial reticulocyte count is needed to determine bone marrow function. Macrocytic anemia, which is uncommon in children, warrants subsequent evaluation for vitamin B12 and folate deficiencies, hypothyroidism, hepatic disease, and bone marrow disorders.

### Prevalence of anemia in persons 65 years and older in the United States: evidence for a high rate of unexplained anemia [^8de138bc]. Blood (2004). Low credibility.

Clinicians frequently identify anemia in their older patients, but national data on the prevalence and causes of anemia in this population in the United States have been unavailable. Data presented here are from the noninstitutionalized US population assessed in the third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (1988–1994). Anemia was defined by World Health Organization criteria; causes of anemia included iron, folate, and B(12) deficiencies, renal insufficiency, anemia of chronic inflammation (ACI), formerly termed anemia of chronic disease, and unexplained anemia (UA). ACI by definition required normal iron stores with low circulating iron (less than 60 microg/dL). After age 50 years, anemia prevalence rates rose rapidly, to a rate greater than 20% at age 85 and older. Overall, 11.0% of men and 10.2% of women 65 years and older were anemic. Of older persons with anemia, evidence of nutrient deficiency was present in one third, ACI or chronic renal disease or both was present in one third, and UA was present in one third. Most occurrences of anemia were mild; 2.8% of women and 1.6% of men had hemoglobin levels lower than 110 g/L (11 g/dL). Therefore, anemia is common, albeit not severe, in the older population, and a substantial proportion of anemia is of indeterminate cause. The impact of anemia on quality of life, recovery from illness, and functional abilities must be further investigated in older persons.

Materials and methods

Study design and data source

An observational cohort study was undertaken using the 2010–2019 Nationwide Readmission Database (NRD). The NRD is a publicly available de-identified Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP) dataset comprised of data on all hospitalized patients in 27 contributing states. It contains over 100 clinical and nonclinical variables and can facilitate longitudinal follow-up of patients between hospitalizations within the same state. It can therefore track both planned and unplanned readmissions, even when they occur in different hospitals. Through sampling weights, the NRD can be used to generate national estimates. The study design was deemed exempt from full review by the Thomas Jefferson University Institutional Review Board.

Study population

The analysis included all adult patients (> 18 years) admitted between January 2010 and December 2019 with an International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) and International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) primary diagnosis code corresponding to diverticulitis of colon without mention of hemorrhage undergoing PADLI or HP. These procedures were defined using ICD-9-CM procedure codes and ICD-10-Procedural Coding Terminology (PCS) as described elsewhere (Appendix). The exclusion criteria were trauma, malignancy, non-emergent/elective, inpatient mortality during index admission, ostomy closure during same admission, and transfers. In addition, patients with less than 6 months of follow-up data were excluded.

Demographic, clinical, and hospital characteristics

Variables extracted included age, insurance, zip code, income quartile, same-state resident status, Elixhauser Comorbidity Index (ECI), NRD-provided comorbidities (chronic pulmonary disease, obesity, diabetes, hypertension, peripheral vascular disease, deficiency anemia, coagulopathy, weight loss), smoking, NRD-provided severity of illness, peritonitis, intraabdominal abscess, sepsis, laparoscopic approach, weekend admission, hospital colectomy volume quartile, hospital ownership, bed size of hospital (small, medium, and large, as defined by HCUP), teaching status, and hospital urban–rural designation.

### The accuracy of mean corpuscular volume guided anaemia classification in primary care [^30d47e7e]. Family Practice (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Anemia can be categorized into micro-, normo- or macrocytic anemia based on the mean corpuscular volume (MCV). This categorization might help to define the etiology of anemia.

Methods

The cohort consisted of patients newly diagnosed with anaemia in primary care. Seven aetiologies of anaemia were defined, based on an extensive laboratory protocol. Two assumptions were tested: (i) MCV < 80 fl (microcytic) excludes vitamin B12 deficiency, folic acid deficiency, suspected haemolysis and suspected bone marrow disease as anaemia aetiology. (ii) MCV > 100 fl (macrocytic) excludes iron deficiency anaemia, anaemia of chronic disease and renal anaemia as anaemia aetiology.

Results

Data of 4129 patients were analysed. One anaemia aetiology could be assigned to 2422 (59%) patients, more than one anaemia aetiology to 888 (22%) patients and uncertainty regarding the aetiology remained in 819 (20%) patients. MCV values were within the normal range in 3505 patients (85%). In 59 of 365 microcytic patients (16%), the anaemia aetiology was not in accordance with the first assumption. In 233 of 259 macrocytic patients (90%), the anaemia aetiology was not in accordance with the second assumption.

Conclusions

Anaemia aetiologies might be ruled out incorrectly if MCV guided classification is used as a first step in the diagnostic work-up of anaemia. We recommend using a broader set of laboratory tests, independent of MCV.

### ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM codes: what? Why? How? [^fb8d01f8]. Advances in Wound Care (2013). Low credibility.

The wound care industry will gain many benefits when International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-10-Clinical Modification (CM) is implemented. One of the main benefits is that the disease classifications will be consistent with current clinical practice and medical technology advances. The new classification codes will be very granular, which means the level of specificity will greatly improve. Numerous new codes will represent more specific anatomic sites, etiologies, comorbidities, and complications, and will improve the ability to demonstrate severity of illness. For instance, the new feature of laterality is directly built into the new codes: separate codes will distinguish right, left, and bilateral, where needed. The increased granularity will provide better analysis of disease patterns and outbreak of disease. Additionally, the United States will finally be using the same diagnosis coding system as the rest of the world. This article will describe what the ICD-9-CM/ICD-10-CM codes are, why they are so important, and how clinicians and researchers will convert from ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM effective October 1, 2014.

### Association of liver cirrhosis severity with anemia: does it matter? [^0282cc73]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Anemia is the most common complication of liver cirrhosis and is seen in 75% of cases. The etiology of anemia in liver disease is diverse and often multifactorial. Common causes include acute and chronic blood loss due to upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, malnutrition, hypersplenism secondary to portal hypertension, and impaired coagulation. Alcohol causes anemia by its direct bone marrow toxicity, vitamin B12 and folate deficiency due to poor oral intake, and intestinal malabsorption. Treatment-related anemia is seen in patients with chronic hepatitis C virus infection receiving ribavirin and interferon. Hepatitis-associated aplastic anemia, characterized by pancytopenia and hypocellular bone marrow, is an entity seen concurrently with or within 6 months of infection with hepatotropic viruses such as hepatitis B, hepatitis C and Epstein–Barr virus. Given the diverse and sometimes multifactorial etiology (alcohol and hepatitis B) of cirrhosis, it is difficult to determine the exact cause of anemia in these groups of patients.

The most common type of anemia encountered in liver cirrhosis is normocytic normochromic anemia, attributable to the chronic inflammatory state. Acute and chronic blood loss from varices, portal hypertensive gastropathy and gastric antral vascular ectasia can give rise to iron-deficiency anemia, in which the picture is one of microcytic hypochromic anemia. Another common hematological abnormality seen in liver cirrhosis is macrocytosis. The causes of macrocytosis in liver cirrhosis are also multifactorial. Vitamin B12 and folate deficiency is also frequently seen in liver cirrhosis, particularly of alcoholic origin, due to malnutrition and intestinal malabsorption. However, liver cirrhosis is characteristically associated with round macrocytes, whereas B12 and folate deficiency show oval macrocytes and hyper-segmented neutrophils on peripheral blood smear (PBS), along with megaloblastic erythropoiesis on bone marrow examination.

Data source

In this retrospective observational comparative study, data were collected from Italian Healthcare Departments' administrative databases, covering around 9,3 million health-assisted individuals. The following databases were used: (1) demographic database, which contains all patient demographic data, such as gender, age and date of death; (2) pharmaceuticals database, that supplies information on medicinal products reimbursed by the National Health System (NHS), as the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) code, number of packages, number of units per package, unit cost per package, and prescription date; (3) hospitalization database, which encloses all hospitalizations data for patients under analysis, such as the discharge diagnosis codes classified according to the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM), Diagnosis Related Group (DRG) and DRG related charge (provided by the Italian Health System); 4) outpatient specialist services database, which incorporates all information about visits and diagnostic tests for patients under analysis (date and type of prescription, description activity and laboratory test or specialist visit charge); (5) payment exemption database, which contains data of the exemption codes that allow to avoid the contribution charge for services/treatments when specific diseases are diagnosed. An anonymous univocal numeric code was assigned to each study subject to guarantee patients' privacy, in full conformity with the European General Data Protection Regulation (2016/679). The patient code in each database permitted the electronic linkage among all databases. All the results coming out from the analyses were produced as aggregated summaries, which cannot assign, either directly or indirectly, to individual patients. The study was conducted according to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki the study and its updates, and approved by the following Institutional Review Board (or Ethics Committees): (1) Comitato Etico Indipendente Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria 'Consorziale Policlinico' (Bari) (Prot. N 0059036/09/07/2019, 09/07/2019); (2) Comitato Etico Sezione Area Centro – Regione Calabria (Prot. N 43, 22/02/2019); (3) Comitato Etico Lazio 2 (Prot. N 0087354, 15/05/2019; Prot. N 0047061/2020, 12/03/2020); iv) Comitato Etico per la Sperimentazione Clinica delle Province di Verona e Rovigo (Prot. N 50045, 25/07/2018). Informed consent was not required since obtaining it was impossible for organizational reasons (pronouncement of the Data Privacy Guarantor Authority, General Authorization for personal data treatment for scientific research purposes – n.9/2014).

### Lower risk of dementia with AS01-adjuvanted vaccination against shingles and respiratory syncytial virus infections [^9e114be7]. NPJ Vaccines (2025). Medium credibility.

All broad ICD-10 categories of comorbidities were then included to balance comorbidity profiles between cohorts and since indirect link with dementia can be posited for most comorbidity profiles (e.g. respiratory illness increases risk of infection and delirium and thus dementia; diseases of the ear can increase the risk of hearing loss which is a risk factor for dementia).

Some broad ICD-10 categories were further broken down into their most prevalent constituents. This includes 'Neoplasms' (ICD-10 codes C00-D49) that was deemed too heterogeneous (as it includes both benign and malignant neoplasms); cardiovascular diseases (I00-99) and psychiatric disorders (F10-59) given their strong link with dementia; endocrine, nutritional and metabolic disorders (E00-89) which was deemed too heterogeneous and because it contains specific risk factors for dementia such as overweight and obesity, diabetes, thyroid disorders, and vitamin B12/folate deficiency. In addition, compared to our previous study, we also matched for the main autoimmune diseases affecting older adults (autoimmune thyroid diseases, rheumatoid arthritis, Sjögren syndrome, dermatopolymyositis, and Wegener's granulomatosis). This reflects growing evidence for their association with dementia. Prior herpes infections (both herpes simplex and herpes zoster) were also included.

Some factors affecting health and healthcare use (ICD-10 codes Z00-Z99) were also included based on whether they differed substantially between unmatched cohorts (SMD > 0.15) with a prevalence of at least 1 in 30 cases in either cohort.

Finally, to capture proxies of vaccine hesitancy, history of influenza vaccination (recommended every year for all adults in the USA) was included.

### KDIGO clinical practice guideline for anemia in chronic kidney disease [^440b00ef]. KDIGO (2012). Medium credibility.

KDIGO anemia in chronic kidney disease — CBC interpretation and reticulocyte/erythropoietin testing states that the anemia of CKD is hypoproliferative and generally normochromic and normocytic; erythropoietin levels are not useful for evaluation in most clinical settings and are generally not recommended for measurement. Effective erythropoietic proliferative activity is most simply assessed by determining the absolute reticulocyte count. Abnormal white blood cell or platelet counts are not typical of CKD anemia and should prompt investigation for other processes. Reticulocyte counts obtained with automated CBC testing may be high with active blood loss or hemolysis and low with hypoproliferative erythropoiesis. Vitamin B12 or folate deficiency may cause macrocytosis, whereas iron deficiency or inherited disorders of hemoglobin formation may produce microcytosis.

### The tragedy of the implementation of ICD-10-CM as ICD-10: is the cart before the horse or is there a tragic paradox of misinformation and ignorance? [^71b70a4c]. Pain Physician (2015). Low credibility.

The forced implementation of ICD-10-CM (International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification) codes that are specific to the United States, scheduled for implementation October 1, 2015, which is vastly different from ICD-10 (International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision), implemented worldwide, which has 14,400 codes, compared to ICD-10-CM with 144,000 codes to be implemented in the United States is a major concern to practicing U.S. physicians and a bonanza for health IT and hospital industry. This implementation is based on a liberal interpretation of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), which requires an update to ICD-9-CM (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification) and says nothing about ICD-10 or beyond. On June 29, 2015, the Supreme Court ruled that the Environmental Protection Agency unreasonably interpreted the Clean Air Act when it decided to set limits on the emissions of toxic pollutants from power plants, without first considering the costs on the industry. Thus, to do so is applicable to the medical industry with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) unreasonably interpreting HIPAA and imposing existent extensive regulations without considering the cost. In the United States, ICD-10-CM with a 10-fold increase in the number of codes has resulted in a system which has become so complicated that it no longer compares with any other country. Moreover, most WHO members use the ICD-10 system (not ICD-10-CM) only to record mortality in 138 countries or morbidity in 99 countries. Currently, only 10 countries employ ICD-10 (not ICD-10-CM) in the reimbursement process, 6 of which have a single payer health care system. Development of ICD-10-CM is managed by 4 non-physician groups, known as cooperating parties. They include the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), CMS, the American Hospital Association (AHA), and the American Health Information Management Association (AHIMA). The AHIMA has taken the lead with the AHA just behind, both with escalating profits and influence, essentially creating a statutory monopoly for their own benefit. Further, the ICD-10-CM coalition includes 3M which will boost its revenues and profits substantially with its implementation and Blue Cross Blue Shield which has its own agenda. Physician groups are not a party to these cooperating parties or coalitions, having only a peripheral involvement. ICD-10-CM creates numerous deficiencies with 500 codes that are more specific in ICD-9-CM than ICD-10-CM. The costs of an implementation are enormous, along with maintenance costs, productivity, and cash disruptions.

### Association of anemia with health-related quality of life and survival: a large population-based cohort study [^e8efd1f5]. Haematologica (2019). Medium credibility.

Definition of anemia and classification into subtypes of anemia

In accordance with the WHO criteria, anemia was defined as a hemoglobin concentration < 13.0 g/dL (8.0 mmol/L) in adult men and < 12.0 g/dL (7.5 mmol/L) in adult, non-pregnant women. In anemic subjects older than 60 years of age additional biochemical tests were performed, using stored plasma, to determine the type of anemia: anemia due to nutritional deficiency, ACI or unexplained anemia. There is no worldwide accepted classification into subtypes of anemia. Reference values were taken from the University Medical Center Groningen or from published literature, as indicated. Iron deficiency was considered present if the participant had two or three of the following criteria: serum ferritin concentration < 30 μg/L, transferrin saturation rate < 16% or hepcidin concentration < 0.5 nmol/L. – Transferrin saturation was calculated by dividing serum iron by total iron-binding capacity [transferrin (g/L)×25]. Folate deficiency was defined as a serum folate level < 9.8 nmol/L. Vitamin B12 deficiency was defined as a serum methylmalonic acid concentration > 340 nmol/L, if the estimated glomerular filtration was > 30 mL/min (because methylmalonic acid levels may be elevated in people with severely impaired renal function). If there was no evidence of nutrient deficiency, subjects with anemia were evaluated for other causes. Subjects were classified as having anemia related to chronic renal disease if the estimated glomerular filtration rate was < 30 mL/min. The Chronic Kidney Disease-Epidemiology Collaboration (CDK-EPI) formula was used to calculate the estimated glomerular filtration rate. ACI was defined as present if the participant had (i) a C-reactive protein concentration > 5.0 mg/L or an absolute number of leukocytes > 10×10 9 /L and (ii) two or more of the following criteria: transferrin saturation rate < 16%, serum ferritin concentration > 100 μg/L, serum iron < 10 μmol/L and hepcidin > 14.7 nmol/L in men or hepcidin > 15.6 nmol/L in women. If subjects with anemia could not be classified into any of these categories, they were considered, by exclusion, to have unexplained anemia.

Details of the Lifelines cohort, clinical examination, biochemical measurements, RAND 36-Item Health Survey and data description and statistical analysis are provided in the Online Supplementary Data.

Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) definitions — strength of recommendation: For Strong recommendations, most individuals in this situation would want the recommended course of action and only a small proportion would not, and most individuals should receive the recommended course of action, with formal decision aids not likely to be needed. For Conditional recommendations, the majority of individuals in this situation would want the suggested course of action, but many would not, and different choices will be appropriate for different patients; decision aids may be useful in helping individuals in making decisions consistent with their values and preferences, and clinicians should expect to spend more time with patients when working towards a decision.
