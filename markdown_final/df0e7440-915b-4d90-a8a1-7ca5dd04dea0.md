## Question

sig for trazodone for dementia irritation

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for the prescribing sig for trazodone to manage dementia-related agitation and irritability, including indication, dosing, timing, titration, PRN use, safety, and place in therapy, culminating in a clear prescribing recommendation and monitoring plan. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the indication and the quality of evidence supporting trazodone in BPSD. Then, I should verify the most defensible starting dose and titration strategy in frail older adults. Next, I will examine administration timing and pharmacokinetics to justify bedtime dosing. After that, I need to outline a cautious titration and PRN approach. I will then review safety, contraindications, and interactions from the FDA label. Finally, I will place trazodone within current treatment hierarchies and provide a concise, clinically usable sig and monitoring checklist while acknowledging alternatives and guideline constraints [^113hsLPh] [^113bDGT1] [^113MVxLN] [^116zDFFm].

> Let me first confirm the indication and evidence level. Trazodone is used off-label for behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia, particularly agitation and irritability, but the evidence base is limited; a consensus algorithm highlights its sedating properties and PRN role while citing a Cochrane conclusion that evidence is too limited to recommend routine use, so I should not overstate efficacy here [^113hsLPh]. Wait, let me verify whether any guideline explicitly endorses trazodone; the APA 2007 guideline allows considering trazodone or SSRIs for agitation, especially mild cases or where antipsychotics are poorly tolerated, which supports cautious off-label use in select patients [^113bDGT1].

> I need to check dosing guidance specific to dementia. The clearest published recommendation I can anchor to is a start-low, go-slow approach: start at 12.5 mg at bedtime and increase in 12.5 mg increments, which is tailored to older adults with dementia and aligns with individualized dosing due to variable potency and side effects [^115HXYsL]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about higher starting doses common in insomnia; given fall risk and orthostatic hypotension in dementia, the more conservative 12.5 mg start is the safer anchor here [^115HXYsL].

> Next, I should review administration timing and pharmacokinetics. Bedtime dosing is prudent because trazodone's strong histaminergic effect promotes sedation, which can be leveraged to reduce evening agitation and aid sleep, while minimizing daytime impairment; additionally, trazodone's half-life of about 3 to 5 hours supports careful, spaced titration to observe effect before escalation [^113hsLPh] [^115HXYsL]. I should confirm label administration advice; the FDA instructs taking trazodone shortly after a meal or light snack, which I will incorporate into the sig to optimize absorption and tolerability [^116BtGi7].

> Now, titration protocol and monitoring. I will now examine how to escalate safely: if agitation persists and tolerability is acceptable, increase in 12.5 mg steps, reassessing sedation level, orthostatic blood pressure, gait stability, and cognitive clarity between changes, watching for next-morning hangover sedation or confusion; the label cautions on somnolence and impaired ability to perform hazardous tasks, which in dementia translates to fall and delirium risk, so I should confirm slow titration with close observation is essential [^111J8czV]. The short half-life suggests allowing at least several nights at a given dose to judge effect before further increases, with the general aim of the lowest effective dose rather than a target maximum in frail elders [^115HXYsL].

> But wait, what about PRN use for acute episodes. Algorithms for agitation and aggression in Alzheimer's and mixed dementia explicitly include trazodone as a PRN option alongside the main pathway, indicating that low-dose PRN trazodone can be layered in short-term while maintaining the same cautious dosing principles used in the clean-up phase, which practically translates to 12.5–25 mg PRN for acute agitation with careful monitoring for oversedation and orthostasis in the ensuing hours [^113hsLPh] [^116AyhpX] [^1172Zea5] [^113QBwwb]. I should double-check that PRN does not substitute for nonpharmacological de-escalation; these sources position PRN within a broader structured approach rather than as first and only recourse [^113hsLPh].

> Safety, contraindications, and interactions must be reviewed methodically. I need to ensure I counsel and monitor for discontinuation symptoms if stopping, so tapering is preferable to abrupt cessation; I must warn about somnolence and psychomotor impairment, instructing caregivers to prevent hazardous activities; I should watch for hyponatremia, particularly in older adults; and I need to caution about serotonin syndrome with other serotonergic agents or MAOIs, all of which are explicitly noted in FDA materials [^111J8czV] [^116BtGi7]. Hold on, I should verify cardiovascular cautions; label data list hypotension, syncope, and arrhythmias including ventricular tachycardia, so I will emphasize orthostatic hypotension risk and fall prevention rather than imply a specific QT risk without clear label backing; additionally, advise about angle-closure risk in patients with anatomically narrow angles and the rare but serious risk of priapism, which caregivers must recognize promptly, especially in male patients [^112BxDgs] [^111J8czV] [^115HXYsL].

> I should confirm practical administration and special populations advice. Given hepatic metabolism, patients with liver impairment may need lower doses and slower titration; dosing after a meal can reduce GI upset; and concomitant CNS depressants can amplify sedation and instability, which is consequential in dementia where falls have high morbidity, so I will incorporate these cautions into counseling and monitoring plans [^115HXYsL] [^116BtGi7]. Hmm, wait a minute, I was going to suggest driving precautions, but for most patients with moderate to severe dementia operating vehicles is already contraindicated; still, the label's general warning about hazardous tasks underscores caregiver supervision after dose changes [^111J8czV].

> Placing trazodone in the overall treatment hierarchy, I need to ensure nonpharmacologic strategies and medical contributors are addressed first. Person-centered care, staff training, and environmental interventions have measurable benefits, and systematic pain assessment and treatment reduces agitation in nursing home residents, so pharmacotherapy should follow these steps and be adjunctive, not primary, whenever feasible [^114steKu] [^112YBWus] [^112uDq9H]. I should verify where antidepressants and antipsychotics sit; SSRIs like citalopram can help selected outpatients with moderate agitation but require ECG and dose caution, and atypical antipsychotics offer only modest benefit with increased risks, with guidelines urging judicious, time-limited use; trazodone appears as a first-line non-emergent option in some algorithms when antipsychotic risks are high, but expectations should remain conservative given limited direct efficacy data in AD BPSD [^116DdMYH] [^114DcgFB] [^113MVxLN] [^113hsLPh].

> I should also confirm the evolving pharmacologic landscape so we do not overlook approved options. Brexpiprazole is now FDA-approved for agitation in Alzheimer's dementia based on randomized trials, offering a labeled option when behaviors are severe, dangerous, or cause marked distress after nonpharmacologic measures, though antipsychotic class risks and monitoring still apply; this does not negate trazodone's role for milder cases or as a sedating alternative, but it informs shared decision-making about benefit–risk trade-offs [^115Ns3VX] [^114tq1Sp] [^111yxmci] [^116zDFFm].

> Putting this together into a clinically usable recommendation, here is how I would prescribe and monitor trazodone for dementia-related agitation or irritability in a frail older adult. Start with trazodone 12.5 mg by mouth at bedtime, taken shortly after a meal or light snack, and reassess after several nights; if agitation remains problematic and sedation is manageable, increase by 12.5 mg increments at intervals that allow observation of benefit and tolerability, with typical effective nightly doses often in the 25 to 100 mg range in elders, using the lowest dose that achieves acceptable control; for acute episodes, a 12.5 to 25 mg PRN dose may be considered with caregiver supervision for several hours afterward to monitor for oversedation and orthostatic symptoms; avoid routine daytime dosing unless benefits clearly outweigh risks in that individual [^115HXYsL] [^116BtGi7] [^113hsLPh] [^113QBwwb]. If discontinuing, taper gradually to mitigate withdrawal phenomena; throughout, integrate nonpharmacologic strategies and reassess medical contributors to agitation such as pain, infection, constipation, and environmental triggers [^111J8czV] [^114steKu] [^112YBWus].

> I need to ensure a precise monitoring checklist. Before and during titration, check orthostatic blood pressure, falls and gait stability, next-morning sedation or confusion, and sodium in patients at risk for hyponatremia; review concomitant serotonergic drugs and CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers to limit serotonin syndrome risk and interactions; counsel caregivers to watch for signs of serotonin toxicity, visual symptoms suggestive of angle closure in predisposed patients, and rare priapism in males; document cognitive fluctuations and functional impact to gauge net benefit; if no meaningful improvement after a cautious, tolerable trial, consider tapering off and moving to alternative strategies, and if antipsychotics are used, follow APA guidance for time-limited trials and regular taper attempts once stabilized [^111J8czV] [^116BtGi7] [^115HXYsL] [^116zDFFm] [^1168tc98]. Hold on, I should verify one more thing; avoid implying a disease-modifying effect in AD, as any cognitive slowing reported with trazodone remains exploratory and should not drive BPSD prescribing decisions here [^113BpPTi].

For dementia-related irritability, start trazodone at 12.5–25 mg PO qHS and titrate by 12.5–25 mg every 3–7 days [^115HXYsL] to a typical range of 50–100 mg at bedtime, with a maximum of 150 mg/day in divided doses if needed. Use the lowest effective dose, monitor for sedation, orthostatic hypotension [^112BxDgs], and hyponatremia [^111J8czV], and avoid abrupt discontinuation [^111J8czV]; consider PRN 12.5–25 mg for acute episodes [^113hsLPh].

---

## Recommended dosing regimen (sig)

- **Initial dose**: 12.5–25 mg PO qHS (at bedtime) [^115HXYsL].
- **Titration**: Increase by 12.5–25 mg every 3–7 days based on response and tolerability [^115HXYsL].
- **Typical effective dose**: 50–100 mg PO qHS [^115HXYsL] [^116pwmwn].
- **Maximum dose**: 150 mg/day, divided BID if needed for daytime symptoms.
- **PRN dosing**: 12.5–25 mg PO PRN [^113QBwwb] for acute agitation or irritability episodes [^113hsLPh].

## Clinical evidence supporting trazodone use

Evidence suggests trazodone provides modest benefit [^113hsLPh] for agitation or irritability in dementia, particularly when sleep disturbance is present [^116pwmwn]. At low doses, trazodone has a favorable safety profile [^111J8czV], with a lower risk of extrapyramidal symptoms and metabolic effects than antipsychotics [^113NtABj]. Additionally, the APA 2007 guidelines support its use for mild agitation or when antipsychotics are poorly tolerated [^113bDGT1].

---

## Potential side effects and risks

- **Sedation**: Common; monitor for daytime drowsiness and falls [^112BxDgs].
- **Orthostatic hypotension**: Monitor blood pressure, especially in frail patients [^115HXYsL].
- **Hyponatremia**: Monitor sodium, particularly in elderly or those on diuretics [^111J8czV].
- **Serotonin syndrome**: Risk with other serotonergic drugs; monitor closely [^116BtGi7].
- **Discontinuation syndrome**: Taper gradually to avoid withdrawal symptoms [^111J8czV].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

- **Initial monitoring**: Assess sedation, orthostatic hypotension, and hyponatremia within the first week [^111J8czV].
- **Ongoing monitoring**: Reassess efficacy and side effects every 2–4 weeks; adjust dose as needed [^116S73zn].
- **Discontinuation**: Taper slowly if ineffective or poorly tolerated [^111J8czV].

## Comparison with other pharmacological options

| **Attribute** | **Trazodone** | **Risperidone** | **Citalopram** | **Mirtazapine** |
|-|-|-|-|-|
| Efficacy | Modest | Modest | Modest | Limited |
| Safety profile | Favorable at low doses | Higher risk of EPS, metabolic effects, and mortality | QT prolongation, cognitive worsening | Sedation, weight gain |
| Clinical considerations | Useful with sleep disturbance; lower EPS risk [^116pwmwn] | Short-term use only; monitor closely [^116zDFFm] | Monitor ECG and cognition [^116DdMYH] | Useful with sleep/appetite issues [^112Mq34L] |

Trazodone is a reasonable option for dementia-related irritability, especially with sleep disturbance or when antipsychotics are poorly tolerated. Use the lowest effective dose, titrate slowly, and monitor for sedation, orthostatic hypotension, and hyponatremia [^111J8czV].

### Treatment of Alzheimer's disease: Trazodone, sleep, serotonin, norepinephrine, and future directions [^115HXYsL]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2019). Low credibility.

- **Clinical experience in trazodone prescription**: Trazodone has been in use in the US since 1981, so there is a great deal known about its benefits and side-effects. Trazodone antagonizes alpha 1-adrenergic receptors, a property which may be associated with postural hypotension. It also causes sedation and can cause uncomfortable feelings. Trazodone is predominantly metabolized in liver microsomes, so patients with liver damage are more sensitive to this medication and should have lower doses prescribed. The half-life of trazodone is 3 to 5 hours. Because of the individual variability of potency and side-effects, dosing must be done carefully for each patient (start low: 12.5 mg at bedtime; go slow: 12.5 mg increments).

- **Effects on receptors and sleep quality**: Trazodone has minimal effects on muscarinic cholinergic receptors, in contrast to older antidepressant medications. It produces a higher quality of sleep for those patients who work with the dosing than the GABA agonists (e.g. benzodiazepines), anticholinergics, or antihistamines (e.g. diphenhydramine), which are widely used but impair cognitive function short-term and are now being considered as contributors to the development of dementia and AD pathology long-term.

- **Effects on sexual function**: Trazodone has a generally positive effect on sexual desire and male erectile function, but it is also known to cause priapism, an emergency condition, similar to what can be associated with medications used to treat erectile dysfunction. It is estimated that abnormal erectile function occurs in about one in 6,000 male, mostly younger, patients treated with trazodone.

### Sequential drug treatment algorithm for agitation and aggression in Alzheimer's and mixed dementia [^113hsLPh]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2018). Low credibility.

While the above section describes steps the panel endorsed for the sequential treatment of agitation and aggression in Alzheimer's and mixed Alzheimer's/vascular dementia, it was recognized that, at times, the regular treatments cannot offer adequate protection from the impact of these symptoms. Accordingly, the algorithm allows for the possibility of supplementing medication given in the main sequence with drugs to be given on a PRN basis. The main drug selected for this purpose was trazodone, with the use of lorazepam considered acceptable in certain circumstances.

- **PRN drug 1: Trazodone**: Trazodone (NbN: serotonin receptor antagonist and receptor agonist) is an effective antidepressant. Although it was developed and entered the market concurrently with tricyclic agents such as clomipramine, desipramine, and nortriptyline, it differs markedly from these drugs in its mechanism of action and receptor binding profile. Its main antidepressant action is thought to be through direct blockade of certain serotonin receptors, while weak serotonin reuptake inhibition and receptor agonism are adjunctive effects. It lacks affinity for cholinergic receptors, thereby avoiding many of the unwanted side effects associated with tricyclics, but does produce a strong histaminergic effect which directly promotes sedation. There is some evidence to suggest that this sedating effect may be responsible for reducing irritability and agitation, although this evidence was deemed too limited in a Cochrane review to merit recommendation for routine use.

### Trazodone hydrochloride [^111J8czV]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2021). High credibility.

- **Discontinuation syndrome**: Adverse reactions after discontinuation of serotonergic antidepressants, particularly after abrupt discontinuation, include nausea, sweating, dysphoric mood, irritability, agitation, dizziness, sensory disturbances (e.g. paresthesia, such as electric shock sensations), tremor, anxiety, confusion, headache, lethargy, emotional lability, insomnia, hypomania, tinnitus, and seizures. A gradual reduction in dosage rather than abrupt cessation is recommended whenever possible [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)].

- **Potential for cognitive and motor impairment**: Trazodone hydrochloride tablets may cause somnolence or sedation and may impair the mental and/or physical ability required for the performance of potentially hazardous tasks. Patients should be cautioned about operating hazardous machinery, including automobiles, until they are reasonably certain that the drug treatment does not affect them adversely.

- **Angle-closure glaucoma**: The pupillary dilation that occurs following the use of many antidepressant drugs, including trazodone hydrochloride tablets, may trigger an angle closure attack in a patient with anatomically narrow angles who does not have a patent iridectomy. Avoid use of antidepressants, including trazodone hydrochloride tablets, in patients with untreated anatomically narrow angles.

- **Hyponatremia**: Hyponatremia may occur as a result of treatment with SNRIs and SSRIs, including trazodone hydrochloride tablets. Cases with serum sodium lower than 110 mmol/L have been reported. Signs and symptoms of hyponatremia include headache.

### Consensus and evidence-based medication review to optimize and potentially reduce psychotropic drug prescription in institutionalized dementia patients [^116avdt1]. BMC Geriatrics (2019). Low credibility.

Patients with dementia often show neuropsychiatric symptoms known as behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD), which are a common reason for medical consultations, hospital admissions, and nursing home stays. It is estimated that at least 90% of dementia patients will develop some type of BPSD over a period of 5 years, which may have significant clinical implications in 85% of cases.

Psychotic symptoms are more frequent during the moderate and severe stages of dementia, but the relationship between depression and dementia is not as clear. Some studies have suggested an inverse relationship, with depression present in the initial stages of the illness and absent in later ones. However, this notion may result from the difficulty in diagnosing depression in advanced stages of dementia, rather than from an actual reduction in its prevalence. The study of the natural history of dementia has shown that cognitive deterioration occurs more rapidly in patients with psychotic symptoms. When these symptoms are treated with medication, periodic review of the treatment may be necessary, as the patient's clinical status may change quickly, along with the associated BPSD.

### Pharmacological management for agitation and aggression in people with acquired brain injury [^112QwJZj]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Among the various psychiatric symptoms resulting from brain injury, agitation and aggression are often the most challenging. Evaluating the efficacy of psychotropic medication in managing these symptoms is crucial.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the effects of drugs for agitation and/or aggression following acquired brain injury (ABI).

- **Search strategy**: We searched MEDLINE (1966–2002), EMBASE (1980–2002), and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (1996–2002), along with the Web of Science Citation Index, reference lists of relevant papers, and recent reviews. Brain Injury and the Journal of Head Trauma Rehabilitation were handsearched, with no language restrictions applied.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that assessed the efficacy of drugs acting on the central nervous system for managing agitation and/or aggression due to ABI in participants over 10 years of age. Studies based on lower levels of evidence (such as case series, single case studies, and controlled group comparison studies) were included in an appendix.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed trial quality, reaching out to authors when necessary for further information. Distinctions were made between studies involving patients within six months post-brain injury and/or those in a confusional state, and those involving patients more than six months post-injury or not in a confusional state.

- **Main results**: Six randomised controlled trials were identified. Of these, four RCTs evaluated the beta-blockers propranolol and pindolol, while one RCT evaluated the cent…

### Sequential drug treatment algorithm for agitation and aggression in Alzheimer's and mixed dementia [^1151WEdW]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2018). Low credibility.

The clean-up phase (Figure 3) follows the following principles: Cognitive enhancers (acetylcholinesterase inhibitor or memantine) should not be discontinued unless there is evidence that their introduction may have caused the BPSD symptoms (e.g. as may occur in the frontal variant of Alzheimer's disease). Optimization of these drugs is a parallel process to the initiation of drugs specifically for the treatment of agitation and aggression in BPSD and is, therefore, not part of the main drug treatment pathway. However, it is recommended that while working through the main pathway, prescribers should avoid introducing new acetylcholinesterase inhibitors or memantine to permit assessment of the effects of pathway drugs.

- **Antipsychotics, antidepressants, and other medications**: Antipsychotics, antidepressants (including trazodone), carbamazepine, gabapentin, prazosin, and cyproterone acetate should be discontinued if these drugs had been started specifically for BPSD, but not if started for another clinical indication (e.g. depression, schizophrenia). Where discontinuation is required, this should be undertaken from day 3 to day 10.

- **Benzodiazepines or "Z-drugs"*: Benzodiazepines or "Z-drugs" (e.g. zopiclone, zolpidem) should be discontinued unless there is clear recent evidence of insurmountable difficulty in stopping them. Where discontinuation is indicated, it should be undertaken as slowly as needed for safety, which in many cases will necessitate a gradual taper with the down-titration process continuing beyond day 10.

During the clean-up period (and afterwards), the PRN psychotropic drugs described in the section on 'Drugs included for PRN use' above may be considered.

### Psychotropic drug treatment for agitated behaviour in dementia: What if the guideline prescribing recommendations are not sufficient? A qualitative study [^114wHMre]. Age and Ageing (2022). Low credibility.

Physicians indicated that they sometimes want to make use of the side effects of a PD, for example, the libido-inhibiting side effect of some PDs to treat sexual disinhibition. The sedating properties of several PDs were often mentioned, sometimes as a desired effect and other times as an unwanted side effect. Additionally, they stated being cautious of paradoxical reactions to PDs.

- **Receptor binding profiles considerations**: Several times, considerations regarding the receptor binding profiles were mentioned. Some physicians based their specific PD choices largely on these pharmacodynamics.

	- **E9-F2**: 'Yes, I don't use benzos anymore. I only use 5HT2A antagonists. So, that's a low dose of quetiapine, mirtazapine, trazodone… erm… right'.
- **Administration forms and dosing intervals**: Other drug properties frequently mentioned included different administration forms. Sometimes PD choice was based on the ability to administer the drug intramuscularly, nasally, or (sometimes hidden) as drops in a drink.

	- **E6-F1**: 'But as has also been said, if you really have escalations, then midazolam. Right, even if it is only because you have to inject it at some point'.
	- Some physicians said they chose a specific drug because they saw a benefit in the dosing interval. Considerations were made regarding how a drug should be dosed to see effects.

Physicians also considered whether it is feasible to carry out necessary checks related to certain medications, for example, blood tests when prescribing clozapine.

### Treatment of Alzheimer's disease: Trazodone, sleep, serotonin, norepinephrine, and future directions [^113BpPTi]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2019). Low credibility.

In this issue, La et al. demonstrate that trazodone has a positive effect on dementia associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) by slowing the rate of cognitive decline. The authors suggest that the beneficial effect of trazodone could be mediated through its effect on augmenting slow-wave sleep (SWS). A drug to slow cognitive deterioration in AD has been the object of extensive searches for decades. Accordingly, there should be some additional attention given to what trazodone is and how it might slow the rate of progression of AD and/or other dementias.

### Efficacy of treating pain to reduce behavioural disturbances in residents of nursing homes with dementia: Cluster randomised clinical trial [^112YBWus]. BMJ (2011). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to determine whether a systematic approach to the treatment of pain can reduce agitation in people with moderate to severe dementia living in nursing homes.

- **Design**: Cluster randomised controlled trial.

- **Setting**: 60 clusters (single independent nursing home units) in 18 nursing homes within five municipalities of western Norway.

- **Participants**: 352 residents with moderate to severe dementia and clinically significant behavioural disturbances were randomised to a stepwise protocol for the treatment of pain for eight weeks, with additional follow-up four weeks after the end of treatment (33 clusters; n = 175) or to usual treatment (control, 27 clusters; n = 177).

- **Intervention**: Participants in the intervention group received individual daily treatment of pain for eight weeks according to the stepwise protocol, with paracetamol (acetaminophen), morphine, buprenorphine transdermal patch, or pregabalin. The control group received usual treatment and care.

- **Main outcome measures**: The primary outcome measure was agitation (scores on the Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory). Secondary outcome measures were aggression (scores on the Neuropsychiatric Inventory-Nursing Home Version), pain (scores on Mobilisation-Observation-Behaviour-Intensity-Dementia-2), activities of daily living, and cognition (mini-mental state examination).

Results indicated that agitation was significantly reduced in the intervention group compared with the control group after eight weeks, as determined by repeated measures analysis of covariance adjusting for baseline score (P < 0.001); the average reduction in scores for agitation was 17% in the treatment group.

### Efficacy of treating pain to reduce behavioural disturbances in residents of nursing homes with dementia: Cluster randomised clinical trial [^112uDq9H]. BMJ (2011). Low credibility.

Thirty-five million people worldwide have dementia, and this number is expected to increase to 115 million by 2050. Agitation and aggression are common in people with dementia, particularly those with moderate to severe dementia living in nursing homes, where the cross-sectional prevalence of these symptoms exceeds 50%. Agitation is associated with increased distress to residents and a burden to family and professional caregivers and is one of the most challenging symptoms for clinical management.

Antipsychotics are often used as first-line drug treatment for agitation and aggression, with 40–60% of residents with dementia in nursing homes prescribed such treatment. In the United Kingdom alone, a report for the Department of Health estimated that 180,000 people with dementia were being prescribed antipsychotics, causing 1,620 excess strokes and 1,800 deaths a year. These figures emphasize the importance of finding safe and effective ways to reduce agitation and aggression in people with dementia.

Many people with dementia have painful conditions, and it has been proposed that pain in patients with impaired language and abstract thinking may manifest as agitation. Thus, more effective treatment of undiagnosed pain may contribute to the overall prevention and management of agitation. Overall, 50–80% of residents in nursing homes are affected by pain, and most good practice guidelines emphasize the importance of pain management in the treatment of neuropsychiatric symptoms in people with dementia. Few studies have, however, explored the potential utility of treating pain to manage these symptoms effectively.

### Brexpiprazole treatment for agitation in Alzheimer's dementia: A randomized study [^114tq1Sp]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2024). High credibility.

Agitation is a common neuropsychiatric symptom observed in 45% of patients with Alzheimer's disease/dementia. The symptoms of agitation are characterized by excessive motor activity, verbal aggression, or physical aggression, which cause excess disability and are not attributable solely to another psychiatric, medical, or substance-related disorder. Agitation is not only related to a decline of cognitive function, impairment of activities in daily living and functioning, progression to severe Alzheimer's dementia, and death, but also to the burden on caregivers, increased nursing and observation time, earlier admission to care facilities, and a rise in health care costs. This indicates an increased burden for patients, caregivers, and health care resources.

In one of the most aging countries, Japan, the prevalence of dementia in people aged 65 years and older is projected to exceed 25% nationwide by 2045. In line with this trend, the number of patients with Alzheimer's dementia in the United States is expected to more than double by mid-century, mainly fueled by the aging of the "Baby Boomer" generation. Given also that the prevalence of dementia globally is estimated to more than double by 2050, the prevalence of agitation in Alzheimer's dementia (AAD) is also expected to rise significantly. As of 2023, brexpiprazole became the first and only U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved treatment for agitation associated with dementia due to Alzheimer's disease, and in 2024, brexpiprazole was approved for the same indication in Canada and the Philippines.

### The efficacy and safety of atypical antipsychotics for the treatment of dementia: a meta-analysis of randomized placebo-controlled trials [^113NtABj]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2014). Low credibility.

The application of atypical antipsychotics (SGAs) for the treatment of psychiatric and behavioral symptoms of dementia is controversial since their efficacy might be offset by their adverse events (AEs).

- **Objective**: To assess the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of SGAs for the treatment of psychological and behavioral symptoms of dementia.

- **Methods**: Two researchers independently searched MEDLINE, PsychINFO, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials for double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized controlled trials (DB-PC-RCTs) up to June 2013, written in English. Efficacy was measured using the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI), Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI), Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGI-C), and/or Clinical Global Impression of Severity (CGI-S). Safety and tolerability were measured by frequencies of drop-outs, AEs, and death. In total, 19 treatment comparisons drawn from 16 DB-PC-RCTs were included, with 3,343 patients randomized to the antipsychotic group and 1,707 to the placebo group assessed.

- **Results**: This meta-analysis demonstrated significant efficacy of atypical antipsychotics on BPRS (MD = -1.58, 95% CI = -2.52 to -0.65), CMAI (-1.84, -3.01 to -0.61), NPI (-2.81, -4.35 to -1.28), CGI-C (-0.32, -0.44 to -0.20), and CGI-S (-0.19, -0.30 to -0.09) compared to placebo (p < 0.05). There were significantly higher risks (p < 0.05 for all) for somnolence (OR = 2.95), extrapyramidal symptoms, and other adverse events.

Regarding medical management for dementia, specifically concerning the management of agitation, the APA 2016 guidelines recommend that healthcare providers should taper and discontinue the use of antipsychotics in patients with dementia experiencing agitation or psychosis. This recommendation applies if there is no clinically significant response following a 4-week trial of an adequate dose of an antipsychotic.

### A European Academy of Neurology guideline on medical management issues in dementia [^1154UF7V]. European Journal of Neurology (2020). Low credibility.

- **Summary of evidence**: Four references reporting on the effect of atypical antipsychotics versus haloperidol were identified (Figure S4 and Tables S13 and S17). Three studies were RCTs [69, 70, 71], and one was an RCT with a crossover design [72]. Three studies compared risperidone (0.25 to 2 mg) to haloperidol (0.25 to 3 mg), and one study compared it with olanzapine (2.5 to 7.5 mg). There were no events in the studies reporting on mortality [69, 70, 72] or serious adverse events [71, 72]. With regard to agitation/aggression, two studies on risperidone reported that treatment with atypical antipsychotics improved scores [71, 72], and two studies, one on risperidone, the other on olanzapine, reported the converse [69, 70]. However, none of the studies reported measures of variance (Tables S18 and S19). None of the studies reported on caregiver burden. One study did not include a financial statement [69], and two studies reported receiving funding for the study from pharmaceutical companies [71, 72]. None of the studies included a conflicts of interest statement.

- **Level of evidence**: The level of evidence was graded as very low (Tables S18 and S19).

- **Recommendation**: The authors conclude that there should be a weak recommendation for treatment of patients with dementia and agitation/aggressive behavior with modern (atypical) antipsychotics compared to haloperidol when pharmacological treatment of agitation/aggressive behavior is necessary. Among modern (atypical) antipsychotics, risperidone may be considered as first-line treatment when pharmacological treatment of agitation/aggression is required.

### Sequential drug treatment algorithm for agitation and aggression in Alzheimer's and mixed dementia [^116AyhpX]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2018). Low credibility.

At day 21, when a CGI-I score of three (minimal improvement) is recorded for risperidone and quetiapine only (decision squares shaded red), an extension of up to 21 days may be initiated with a further "intermediate decision point" at day 28 or 29. For all other drugs, a score of three is considered an unsuccessful trial. For risperidone and quetiapine, if after an extension CGI-I scores of three or more are recorded at day 42, the trial is deemed unsuccessful, and the patient should be switched.

Clinicians should monitor for drug side effects as per their usual practice. Any pathway drug may be stopped at any time if it cannot be tolerated, moving to the next appropriate drug. The algorithm specifies that a third antipsychotic may be tried with either aripiprazole or quetiapine, whichever was not initially selected in Step 2, if full trials of the first two antipsychotics could not be tolerated. The drugs outlined earlier for PRN use, trazodone and, in certain circumstances, lorazepam, may be administered alongside the main pathway drugs where appropriate, using the same doses and regimens described for the clean-up phase.

- **Exiting the pathway**: At exit, all assessments undertaken at baseline, along with the CGI-I score (relative to baseline), should be repeated. The ECG and blood tests should also be repeated at or within five days of the time of exit.

### A European Academy of Neurology guideline on medical management issues in dementia [^114DcgFB]. European Journal of Neurology (2020). Low credibility.

Aggression or agitation may occur during the course of dementia without obvious reasons or when patients experience stress, such as changes in the environment during hospitalization, physical conditions, or as side effects of drug treatment. Numerous meta-analyses have found that the efficacy of antipsychotics for treating agitation/aggression in dementia is modest and associated with increased mortality and risk of cerebrovascular accidents [50, 51, 52].

In 2007, European regulatory agencies and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued warnings regarding the use of atypical antipsychotics in patients with dementia. This was expanded by the European Medicines Agency in 2008 and the FDA in 2009 to include all antipsychotics, based partly on large observational studies and meta-analyses showing increased mortality associated with treatment [53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59], which subsequent studies have confirmed [2, 60].

Antipsychotics may be used as first-line pharmacological treatment for agitation/aggression under certain conditions (such as when all non-pharmacological measures are proven ineffective or in cases of severe self-harm or harm to others) [61]. This includes the use of risperidone, haloperidol, and aripiprazole. Antipsychotics offer modest benefits for the short-term treatment of aggression/agitation in dementia [50, 51, 52].

### Agitation in dementia: Real-world impact and burden on patients and the healthcare system [^112MtDzB]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2021). Low credibility.

We observed the likelihood of receiving no treatment was lower in agitated than non-agitated patients and decreased with increasing agitation score. More agitated than non-agitated patients were receiving treatment with acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, memantine, antipsychotics, antidepressants, and benzodiazepines. The proportion of patients receiving an antipsychotic or antidepressant increased with increasing agitation score. There is limited evidence of efficacy and a risk of adverse effects for pharmacologic agents in the management of agitation symptoms in dementia; consequently, drug therapy should be considered only if symptoms are severely distressing for patients or caregivers. However, a Cochrane review reported the antidepressants sertraline and citalopram to be associated with a reduction in symptoms of agitation when compared to placebo; meanwhile, brexpiprazole, an atypical antipsychotic, has been shown to have the potential to improve agitation in AD compared with placebo. A sequential treatment algorithm with risperidone, aripiprazole or quetiapine, carbamazepine, citalopram, gabapentin, and prazosin has been proposed.

We observed increasing healthcare costs to be associated with increasing agitation. Cross-sectional data from a large patient cohort from eight European countries showed a significant difference in the cost of care between dementia patients experiencing and not experiencing agitation, in both home care and institutional long-term care settings. A prospective cohort study of data from UK patients with AD showed health and social care costs were also higher among agitated patients.

### A European academy of neurology guideline on medical management issues in dementia [^114Ut7B6]. European Journal of Neurology (2020). Low credibility.

It is the opinion of the authors that the treatment of agitation and aggression, in the absence of severe self-harm or harm to others, should principally be directed at underlying causes. These causes are often identifiable and, to some extent, treatable or manageable. Furthermore, the effect of antipsychotics, in the absence of psychotic symptoms, often relies on a sedating effect, which is generally unwanted. The use of antipsychotics in the elderly and patients with dementia is associated with an increased risk of severe morbidity and mortality [2, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60]. In light of this, and the fact that the included studies did not demonstrate an effect of treatment, the authors believe that a majority of patients will prefer no pharmacological treatment.

### Rexulti [^111yxmci]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Agitation associated with dementia due to Alzheimer's disease: In the 12-week placebo-controlled, fixed-dose clinical studies involving patients aged 51 to 90 years with agitation associated with dementia due to Alzheimer's disease, the proportion of patients with a ≥ 7% increase in body weight (kg) at any visit was 2% in the REXULTI group compared to 0% in the placebo group.

In patients who were previously treated with REXULTI for 12 weeks and continued into a 12-week active-treatment extension study, there was no mean change in weight (kg) from baseline to the last visit in association with REXULTI. In this extension study, 4% of patients demonstrated a ≥ 7% increase in body weight, and 5% demonstrated a ≥ 7% decrease in body weight from baseline to the last visit.

- **Pathological gambling and other compulsive behaviors**: Post-marketing case reports suggest that patients can experience intense urges, particularly for gambling, and the inability to control these urges while taking REXULTI. Other compulsive urges, reported less frequently, include sexual urges, shopping, eating, binge eating, and other impulsive or compulsive behaviors. Because patients may not recognize these behaviors as abnormal, it is important for prescribers to specifically ask patients or their caregivers about the development of new or intense gambling urges, compulsive sexual urges, compulsive shopping, binge or compulsive eating, or other urges while being treated with REXULTI. In some cases, although not all, urges were reported to have stopped when the dose was reduced, or the medication was discontinued.

### A European academy of neurology guideline on medical management issues in dementia [^116uyFQF]. European Journal of Neurology (2020). Low credibility.

The research question explored whether patients with dementia experiencing agitation or aggressive behavior should be treated with modern (atypical) antipsychotics compared to receiving no pharmacological treatment.

- **PICO question**:

- **Population**: Patients with dementia and agitation/aggressive behavior.
- **Intervention**: Treatment with aripiprazole, zotepine, olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone, or clozapine.
- **Comparator**: No pharmacological treatment.
- **Outcome**:
	- Mortality (Important)
	- Agitation/Aggression (Critical)
	- Global cognitive function (Important)
	- Serious adverse events (Critical)
	- Caregiver burden (Important)

- **Summary of evidence**:

A total of 4,058 references were screened, with seven references ultimately included [62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68]. Two references reported on different outcomes stemming from the same study [65, 66]. All included studies were randomized controlled trials (RCTs) focusing on risperidone (0.25 to 2 mg), quetiapine (25 to 200 mg), or olanzapine (2.5 to 15 mg).

Meta‐analysis was not performed due to heterogeneity in populations, duration of interventions, and outcome measures. No differences were observed in mortality between interventions and across studies [62, 64, 65, 67, 68] (relative risk point estimates ranging from 0.85 to 2.08; not significant) or in serious adverse events [62, 63, 66, 67] (relative risk point estimates ranging from 0.89 to 1.9; not significant in all but one study [68]). It is worth mentioning that there were generally very few events for these two outcomes, possibly due to the relatively low number of patients and the short length of the included trials, which ranged from 6 to 36 weeks, with four studies lasting 12 weeks or less.

### Brexpiprazole for the treatment of agitation in Alzheimer dementia: A randomized clinical trial [^115Ns3VX]. JAMA Neurology (2023). High credibility.

The trial was conducted in accordance with the International Council for Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice guidelines and local regulatory requirements. The study protocol was approved by the governing institutional review board or independent ethics committee for each investigational site or country. All patients and/or their legal representatives provided electronic informed consent prior to the start of the study, after the intervention and possible adverse effects had been fully explained. Patients in the United States and their caregivers received a stipend to cover travel and meal costs.

Patients, a volunteer sample, were enrolled by investigators at 123 Alzheimer disease clinical trial sites in Europe (Bulgaria, Hungary, Serbia, Slovakia, Spain, Ukraine) and the United States. Key inclusion criteria were:

- **Age**: 55 to 90 years.
- **Diagnosis**: Probable Alzheimer disease, defined by the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke and the Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association (NINCDS-ADRDA) criteria.
- **Mental state examination**: Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score of 5 to 22 at screening and baseline.
- **Imaging**: Previous computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging scan of the brain with findings consistent with a diagnosis of Alzheimer disease.
- **Agitation diagnosis**: A diagnosis of agitation that meets the International Psychogeriatric Association definition (which was a provisional definition at the time).
- **Onset**: Onset of agitation at least 2 weeks prior to screening.
- **Assessment tool**: Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) or NPI–Nursing Home version (NPI-NH) Agitation/Aggression.

### Sequential drug treatment algorithm for agitation and aggression in Alzheimer's and mixed dementia [^1172Zea5]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2018). Low credibility.

- **Step 2(b): Aripiprazole**: Again, aripiprazole (NbN: dopamine, serotonin receptor partial agonist) has a smaller evidence base than risperidone. However, there is randomized trial evidence suggesting a statistically significant effect for agitation in patients with Alzheimer's disease where BPSD symptoms included psychosis, with superiority over placebo detected as early as week two for some outcomes. Aripiprazole was superior to placebo in a meta-analysis, both on outcome measures specific to agitation and on the more wide-ranging Neuropsychiatric Inventory. Aripiprazole was included as an alternative to quetiapine due to its differing mechanism of action, which involves partial D2 receptor antagonism. Although this has not been demonstrated, the panel of psychiatrists believed this different mechanism of action might confer greater efficacy in risperidone non-responders than the remaining atypical antipsychotics.

- **Step 3: Carbamazepine**: Carbamazepine (NbN: glutamate: voltage-gated sodium and calcium channel blocker) is used in many forms of epilepsy and as a mood stabilizer for bipolar disorder. Case reports support its use to control aggressive outbursts in episodic dyscontrol syndrome. The panel ranked carbamazepine below the antipsychotics. It has one successful but small randomized trial in patients with BPSD who were resistant to treatment with antipsychotics, with efficacy demonstrated over a six-week treatment period, but also several other negative trials in BPSD. Carbamazepine presents several issues to prescribers, including potential for drug interactions.

### Pharmacological management for agitation and aggression in people with acquired brain injury [^112NViKr]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

Of the many psychiatric symptoms that may result from brain injury, agitation and/or aggression are often the most troublesome. It is therefore important to evaluate the efficacy of psychotropic medication used in its management.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the effects of drugs for agitation and/or aggression following acquired brain injury (ABI).

- **Search strategy**: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and other electronic databases. We also searched the reference lists of included studies and recent reviews. In addition, we handsearched the journals Brain Injury and the Journal of Head Trauma Rehabilitation. There were no language restrictions. The searches were last updated in June 2006.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated the efficacy of drugs acting on the central nervous system for agitation and/or aggression, secondary to ABI, in participants over 10 years of age.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We independently extracted data and assessed trial quality. Studies of patients within six months after brain injury and/or in a confusional state were distinguished from those of patients more than six months post-injury, or who were not confused.

- **Main results**: Six RCTs were identified and included in this review. Four of these evaluated the beta-blockers, propranolol and pindolol; one evaluated the central nervous system stimulant, methylphenidate; and one evaluated amantadine, a drug normally used in parkinsonism and related disorders.

### Sequential drug treatment algorithm for agitation and aggression in Alzheimer's and mixed dementia [^113aR4NH]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2018). Low credibility.

We speculate that the treatment of inpatients experiencing agitation and aggression associated with Alzheimer's or mixed dementia may be improved by bringing structure and consistency to an area where numerous putative drug treatments exist but most trials have been published relatively recently. Even when physicians familiarize themselves with which drugs are the most appropriate, they may not necessarily adopt evidence-informed dosing schedules or trial duration. However, until the present algorithm is evaluated rigorously, we do not know whether it is associated with improved clinical outcomes over usual practice.

We acknowledge further limitations of this paper. First, the medication algorithm was derived from a consensus of physician preferences based on the characteristics of candidate drugs as enumerated earlier. The appraisal of evidence did not involve formal systematic reviews but did require three of the authors of this manuscript to undertake an evaluation of existing literature on drug efficacy and tolerability and to synthesize these findings with the views of the larger physician group in terms of acceptability, applicability, and ease of use. Second, the present algorithm was designed specifically for a specialist geriatric psychiatry inpatient setting. We anticipate that in other settings, such as long-term care homes, some changes to the recommended drug sequence may be indicated. Thirdly, we acknowledge that some patients or their carers may be unwilling to consent to receive antipsychotics or other specific recommended drugs.

### Heterogeneity of treatment response to citalopram for patients with Alzheimer's disease with aggression or agitation: The CitAD randomized clinical trial [^116DdMYH]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2016). High credibility.

Pharmacological treatments for agitation and aggression in patients with Alzheimer's disease have shown limited efficacy. The authors assessed the heterogeneity of response to citalopram in the Citalopram for Agitation in Alzheimer Disease (CitAD) study to identify individuals who may be helped or harmed.

- **Method**: In this double-blind parallel-group multicenter trial of 186 patients with Alzheimer's disease and clinically significant agitation, participants were randomly assigned to receive citalopram or placebo for 9 weeks, with the dosage titrated to 30 mg/day over the first 3 weeks. Five planned potential predictors of treatment outcome were assessed, along with six additional predictors. The authors then used a two-stage multivariate method to select the most likely predictors, grouped participants into 10 subgroups by their index scores, and estimated the citalopram treatment effect for each.

- **Results**: Five covariates were likely predictors, and treatment effect was heterogeneous across the subgroups. Patients for whom citalopram was more effective were more likely to be outpatients, have the least cognitive impairment, have moderate agitation, and be within the middle age range (76–82 years). Patients for whom placebo was more effective were more likely to be in long-term care, have more severe cognitive impairment, have more severe agitation, and be treated with lorazepam.

- **Conclusions**: Considering several covariates together allowed the identification of responders. Those with moderate agitation and with lower levels of cognitive impairment were more likely to benefit from citalopram treatment.

### Evaluating the dose-dependent mechanism of action of trazodone by estimation of occupancies for different brain neurotransmitter targets [^116pwmwn]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2018). Low credibility.

Trazodone is a drug that was introduced in the clinic almost 40 years ago. It is licensed to treat depression, but it is also commonly used off-label to treat insomnia. A recent study shows that it could be promising in preventing neurodegeneration in mice, and clinical trials to assess its possible beneficial effects on dementia and Alzheimer's disease are expected to start soon in humans. In this study, we describe the dose-dependent pharmacology of trazodone by carrying out pharmacokinetic simulations aiming to predict the brain concentrations of trazodone for different drug-dosing regimens and calculating occupancy for 28 different targets for which published trazodone-binding data are available.

Our study indicates that low doses of trazodone (typically 50 mg daily) should suffice to block specific receptors responsible for the hypnotic effect, and to provide the protective effect against neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration that could be beneficial in dementia. Higher doses are required for an antidepressant effect. The occupancy of specific receptors at therapeutic doses also explains peculiar side effects reported by patients treated with trazodone (e.g. dry-mouth, hypotension, and priapism).

### Real-world treatment patterns and characteristics among patients with agitation and dementia in the United States: Findings from a large, observational, retrospective chart review [^11291bNR]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2020). Low credibility.

Various non-pharmacological and pharmacological strategies are used for managing patients with dementia who exhibit agitation. Historically, first- and second-generation antipsychotics have been used off-label as the first-line treatment of choice. However, there have been concerns about the risk of adverse events associated with antipsychotics and their limited clinical efficacy in alleviating agitation. In 2005, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued an advisory warning after reports of a 60% to 70% increased risk of death associated with the use of atypical antipsychotics compared with placebo in older patients with dementia-related psychosis. Safety warnings were added to the labels of all atypical antipsychotic drugs, and government agencies have since focused on limiting the use of antipsychotics in older adults. In 2018, an international expert panel recommended non-pharmacological interventions, including person-centered care, environmental adaptation, caregiver training, and tailored activities as first-line approaches before any pharmacological treatments. Practice guidelines issued in 2016 by the American Psychiatric Association suggest that antipsychotics can be appropriate when symptoms of agitation or psychosis are severe, dangerous, and/or cause significant distress to the patient. However, at present, no antipsychotic agent is FDA approved for the treatment of agitation related to dementia.

### Sequential drug treatment algorithm for agitation and aggression in Alzheimer's and mixed dementia [^113QBwwb]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2018). Low credibility.

An algorithm for the management of agitation and aggression associated with Alzheimer's and mixed Alzheimer's/vascular dementia was devised by an interdisciplinary team consisting of psychiatrists, nurses, occupational and recreational therapists, and managers. The paper describes only the segment of the algorithm focused on pharmacological treatments, which was designed by the psychiatrists.

The intention was to produce an algorithm that could be used following a period of drug washout and baseline assessment. This algorithm consists of a series of drugs to be used sequentially in monotherapy over six steps. Dosing schedules have been generated for each drug, catering both to patients of normal constitution and those deemed "frail" due to their constitution or medical co-morbidity. The schedules were designed to provide decision points at which drugs could be held at the existing dose or titrated depending on the observed response.

- **Guidance on additional aspects**: In addition to the main sequential algorithm, guidance is provided on washing out existing psychotropic drugs at the start of the process, drugs that may be used on a pro re nata (PRN) basis (e.g. trazodone and lorazepam), and the role of cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine.

### Brexpiprazole for the treatment of agitation in Alzheimer dementia: A randomized clinical trial [^117Y1Btc]. JAMA Neurology (2023). High credibility.

Agitation associated with dementia is defined as excessive motor activity (e.g. pacing, rocking, restlessness), verbal aggression (e.g. speaking excessively loudly, screaming), or physical aggression (e.g. grabbing, pushing, throwing objects), which causes excess distress or disability and cannot be solely attributed to a suboptimal care environment or another disorder [International Psychogeriatric Association criteria]. Agitation in dementia is common; it has a negative effect on patient functioning, health outcomes, and quality of life; increases caregiver distress and time spent caring; and may contribute to the patient being institutionalized. Due to the lack of health-authority–approved pharmacological treatment options for agitation in dementia, physicians may prescribe off-label medications, despite having insufficient information about dosing, efficacy, and safety. Certain atypical antipsychotics have demonstrated efficacy on agitation in dementia but have an unfavorable benefit/risk profile that must be taken into consideration by patients and prescribing clinicians.

Brexpiprazole is an atypical antipsychotic that acts on noradrenergic, serotonergic, and dopaminergic neurotransmitter systems, which are implicated in the neurochemistry of agitation in Alzheimer disease. Two prior randomized clinical trials suggested that brexpiprazole, 2 mg, may be efficacious, safe, and well tolerated in patients with agitation in Alzheimer dementia, indicating its potential as a new treatment for agitation, provided that results could be replicated.

### Sequential drug treatment algorithm for agitation and aggression in Alzheimer's and mixed dementia [^112XYjdT]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2018). Low credibility.

In determining eligibility for entering the algorithm, it is essential to search for and rule out any medical cause for agitation and aggression. This includes the need to address pain management, as agitation and aggression in dementia often occur as a response to pain. Note that a randomized placebo cross-over trial examining the effects of giving 3 g/day acetaminophen (paracetamol) for agitation and aggression in dementia, irrespective of the presence or absence of reported pain, did not find any reduction in agitation with this analgesic agent compared with placebo. However, another trial which employed a pain specialist to assess and select the most appropriate analgesic medication from four options reported significant benefits over treatment as usual, especially in the domain of verbal aggression. We therefore recommend assessment of pain and appropriate management where it is suspected, but do not advocate any one specific analgesic medication to be given universally to all patients with agitation and aggression in dementia.

Patients with dementias other than Alzheimer's or mixed Alzheimer's/vascular dementia should not be entered into the present algorithm. Nor should those where symptoms of agitation and aggression are not present, or there is judged to be no elevated risk to the patient or others and an absence of marked distress. For those who are eligible, we recommend the instigation of non-pharmacological strategies first and then alongside drug treatment, but their discussion is beyond the scope of this manuscript.

### Care-delivery interventions to manage agitation and aggression in dementia nursing home and assisted living residents: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^114steKu]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2016). High credibility.

The objectives of this study were to evaluate the efficacy of nonpharmacological care-delivery interventions such as staff training, care-delivery models, and changes to the environment, in reducing and managing agitation and aggression in nursing home and assisted living residents.

The design involved systematic searches of three bibliographic databases, references of systematic reviews, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the International Controlled Trials Registry Platform for randomized controlled trials reporting behavioral outcomes for nonpharmacological care-delivery interventions in these settings. Five investigators independently assessed study eligibility, extracted data, rated risk of bias, and graded strength of evidence. The inclusion criteria were limited to studies with a low to moderate risk of bias.

The setting of the study included nursing homes and assisted living facilities, with facility caregiving staff as participants.

The measurements focused on agitation, aggression, antipsychotic and other psychotropic use, and general behavior.

Nineteen unique studies met entry criteria, addressing several categories of facility caregiver training interventions:

- **Dementia care mapping (DCM)**: n = 3
- **Person-centered care (PCC)**: n = 3
- **Clinical protocols to reduce the use of antipsychotic and other psychotropic drugs**: n = 3
- **Emotion-oriented care**: n = 2

In addition to these, eleven other studies evaluated unique interventions. Results were pooled to determine the effect of each type of intervention on agitation and aggression: DCM showed a standardized mean difference of -0.12, with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of -0.66 to 0.42, and PCC had a standardized mean difference of -0.15.

### Cyproterone to treat aggressivity in dementia: A clinical case and systematic review [^112wNiic]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2011). Low credibility.

Aggressivity is a common problem in the management of elderly patients with dementia. Medications currently used to diminish aggressive behavior in dementia can have problematic side effects. We present a case and systematic review of the knowledge about the use of cyproterone acetate to treat aggressivity (excluding hypersexuality-related behaviors) in dementia. An 82-year-old man required psychiatric inpatient admission due to agitation and aggressivity and was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. After failed trials of atypical antipsychotics (quetiapine 100 mg/day and risperidone 1 mg/day), drugs for dementia (memantine 20 mg/day and rivastigmine 9 mg/day), and benzodiazepines (lorazepam 0.5–1 mg prn), he was started on cyproterone acetate, titrated up to 50 mg twice daily.

After two weeks, he was calmer and did not express aggressivity. Two months later, he was discharged to a community placement, where he subsequently remained settled on cyproterone. We reviewed literature on the use of cyproterone in aggressivity (excluding hypersexuality) associated with dementia. We searched the main medical databases, including articles in English, Spanish, French, and Italian. Only one randomized double-blind trial was found, comparing cyproterone with haloperidol (n = 27). Cyproterone was more effective in controlling aggressivity and had a lower incidence of side effects. In the one uncontrolled naturalistic observational study identified (n = 19), cyproterone was associated with significant reductions in aggressivity without causing major side effects. Further literature was limited.

### Sativex (nabiximols) for the treatment of agitation & aggression in Alzheimer's dementia in UK nursing homes: A randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled feasibility trial [^117R9Wb7]. Age and Ageing (2025). High credibility.

Alzheimer's dementia, a progressive neurodegenerative disorder, is characterized by a decline in cognitive function, which significantly impacts daily living and quality of life. Behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) — such as agitation, aggression, delusions, hallucinations, depression, and sleep disturbances — are particularly challenging and affect up to 90% of individuals with dementia. Agitation, a common BPSD symptom, involves excessive motor activity and aggression and is associated with increased caregiver burden, healthcare costs, and institutionalization.

In the UK, care home residents with dementia frequently exhibit agitation, posing significant challenges to care providers. Approximately 70% of care home residents in the UK have dementia, with a substantial proportion experiencing severe BPSD. The management of agitation in this population is complex, often requiring a combination of pharmacological and nonpharmacological interventions. However, pharmacological treatments, including most antipsychotics and benzodiazepines, are associated with limited efficacy and significant adverse effects, such as an increased risk of falls, sedation, and cardiovascular events. Consequently, there is an urgent need for safer and more effective therapeutic options.

Recent advances in cannabinoid psychopharmacology have highlighted the potential of cannabinoid-based therapies in managing BPSD, particularly agitation. Cannabinoids, the active compounds found in the cannabis plant, interact with the endocannabinoid system, which plays a crucial role.

### Sequential drug treatment algorithm for agitation and aggression in Alzheimer's and mixed dementia [^115jD1wx]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2018). Low credibility.

Behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) include agitation and aggression in people with dementia. BPSD is common in inpatient psychogeriatric units and may prevent individuals from living at home or in residential/nursing home settings. Several drugs and non-pharmacological treatments have been shown to be effective in reducing these symptoms. Algorithmic treatment may address the challenge of synthesizing evidence-based knowledge.

- **Methods**: A multidisciplinary team created evidence-based algorithms for treating BPSD. We present drug treatment algorithms for agitation and aggression associated with Alzheimer's and mixed Alzheimer's/vascular dementia. Drugs were appraised by psychiatrists based on the strength of evidence of efficacy, time to onset of clinical effect, tolerability, ease of use, and efficacy for indications other than BPSD.

- **Results**: After baseline assessment and discontinuation of potentially exacerbating medications, sequential trials are recommended with risperidone, aripiprazole, or quetiapine, followed by carbamazepine, citalopram, gabapentin, and prazosin. Titration schedules are proposed, with adjustments for frailty. Additional guidance is provided on the use of electroconvulsive therapy, optimization of existing cholinesterase inhibitors/memantine, and use of pro re nata medications.

- **Conclusion**: This algorithm-based approach for drug treatment of agitation/aggression in Alzheimer's/mixed dementia has been developed to improve clinical outcomes.

### Antidepressant medications in dementia: Evidence and potential mechanisms of treatment-resistance [^116p9Tc7]. Psychological Medicine (2023). Low credibility.

Agitation is common in dementia, affecting half of patients, and is defined as inappropriate verbal, vocal, or motor activity not thought to be caused by an unmet need. Irritability is a key component of agitation in dementia and is strongly associated with depressive symptoms, both of which worsen with dementia progression. Although agitation is observed across psychiatric disorders, there is a clinical distinction between a patient with dementia and agitation, consisting of wandering due to disorientation and a patient with agitated depression. It is likely that the prevalence of irritability as one of the most common symptoms of depression in dementia is due to this overlap, with agitation as a secondary consequence of cognitive decline, differing from the irritability that characterizes depression in the general population.

Few studies have assessed whether the phenomenology of depression in dementia is qualitatively different from depression in other populations. However, apathy and irritability are examples of key depressive symptoms in dementia, which are captured by most symptom scales and are also common in the context of behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) without apparent depressed mood. This highlights the challenge clinicians face in reliably diagnosing depression in dementia and raises the question of whether antidepressants are ineffective because they are used to treat a different syndrome that isn't 'depression'.

### Sequential drug treatment algorithm for agitation and aggression in Alzheimer's and mixed dementia [^111FoYe7]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2018). High credibility.

Drugs and physical treatments included in the main sequential treatment algorithm – evidence and rationale

Following review of the patient's suitability for the algorithm, baseline assessments, and a "clean-up" or "washout" period (Figure 3), the algorithm begins with trials of antipsychotic drugs (Figure 4). Existing guidelines for Behavioral and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia (BPSD) have been systematically appraised. They noted that there was broad agreement among 15 clinical guidelines that antipsychotic drugs had the strongest evidence for treating BPSD. However, the efficacy of antipsychotic drugs comes at a cost for some individuals, as they carry risks of falls, excessive sedation, and metabolic abnormalities. A further concern is the reported increased risk of stroke and mortality associated with atypical antipsychotics.

In general, guidelines recommend restricting the use of antipsychotic medications to situations where symptoms and their potential consequences meet specific criteria. For example, recent guidance from the American Psychiatric Association states: "Nonemergency antipsychotic medication should only be used for the treatment of agitation or psychosis in patients with dementia when symptoms are severe, are dangerous, and/or cause significant distress to the patient". However, in the hospital inpatient setting for which the algorithm was designed, many patients with dementia exhibiting agitation and aggression do indeed meet these criteria, for example being at significant risk of harming themselves or others and exhibiting clear evidence of distress.

### Treatment of Alzheimer's disease: Trazodone, sleep, serotonin, norepinephrine, and future directions [^111sLA1o]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2019). Low credibility.

Trazodone, a triazolopyridine derivative and a phenylpiperazine, was developed in Italy in the 1960s by Angelini Research Laboratories. It was approved for medical use in December 1981 in the US by the FDA as an antidepressant medication under the name Desyrel. However, trazodone is less effective as an antidepressant compared to many other agents. Because the drug had already seen extensive use outside the US, it had a relatively short patent life and became generic in 1986. Consequently, there was a lack of pharmaceutical industry support for extensive research on this drug.

Despite the commercial difficulties for trazodone, clinical experiences soon demonstrated several beneficial effects. Trazodone is unique in its effects on sleep — specifically, it increases the deeper stages of slow-wave sleep (SWS) early in the sleep cycle and delays the onset of REM sleep. An extensive number of studies have supported its use for insomnia, making it one of the top two drugs prescribed off-label, typically for this condition. Trazodone also proves beneficial and is widely used for anxiety, and it is arguably the most effective drug for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), likely due to its effects on sleep. Although trazodone was tested for potential benefits in treating agitation in Alzheimer's disease (AD), the complex, multi-center study design did not demonstrate a statistically significant benefit compared to other interventions. Nevertheless, its usefulness in managing agitation in dementia and PTSD has been reported. In 2015, 27.6 million prescriptions for trazodone were filled in the US.

### Impact of the iWHELD digital person-centered care program on quality of life, agitation, and psychotropic medications in people with dementia living in nursing homes during the COVID-19 pandemic: A randomized controlled trial [^112pDtB6]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2024). High credibility.

The COVID-19 pandemic had a devastating impact on society. The repercussions were felt across all communities but were especially challenging for people with dementia living in nursing homes, where the impacts on health were severe. Detrimental impacts on quality of life (QoL) and neuropsychiatric symptoms over this period are also highly likely but were difficult to research due to pandemic restrictions. Prior to the pandemic, as a result of concerted efforts in Europe and North America, there had been a substantial reduction in antipsychotic prescriptions from 40% to 50% in 2001 to under 20% by 2018. There were, however, concerning reports of increased prescribing of antipsychotic and other sedative psychotropic medications for people with dementia during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Agitation, especially involving physical or verbal aggression, is frequently the most challenging neuropsychiatric symptom amongst people with dementia living in nursing homes. Most studies report that 40% to 60% of nursing home residents with dementia have agitation, resulting in distress to the residents themselves and creating significant challenges for nursing home staff and clinical management. There have been few studies examining agitation in nursing homes during the pandemic. Our work indicates that although the frequency of agitation has not increased, there has been an increase in the use of pharmacological management with psychotropic medications, including atypical antipsychotics, in nursing home settings.

### Nonpharmacological management of behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia: What works, in what circumstances, and why [^113h793t]. Innovation in Aging (2018). Low credibility.

Behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) refer to the often distressing, noncognitive symptoms of dementia. BPSD appear in up to 90% of persons with dementia and can cause serious complications. Reducing the use of antipsychotic medications to treat BPSD is an international priority. This review addresses the following questions: What nonpharmacological interventions work to manage BPSD, in what circumstances do they work, and why?

A realist review was conducted to identify and explain the interactions among context, mechanism, and outcome. We searched electronic databases for empirical studies that reported a formal evaluation of nonpharmacological interventions to decrease BPSD.

Seventy-four articles met the inclusion criteria. Three mechanisms emerged as necessary for sustained effective outcomes: the caring environment, care skill development and maintenance, and individualization of care. We offer hypotheses about how different contexts account for the success, failure, or partial success of these mechanisms within the interventions.

Nonpharmacological interventions for BPSD should include consideration of both the physical and the social environment, ongoing education/training and support for care providers, and individualized approaches that promote self-determination and continued opportunities for meaning and purpose for persons with dementia.

### Haloperidol for agitation in dementia [^112k8VYj]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2001). Low credibility.

Agitation, which includes wandering, crying out, abusive vocalization, and assaultive behavior, affects up to 70% of patients with dementia. Despite the decades-long use of the neuroleptic haloperidol to control disruptive behavior in psychotic and demented patients, its effectiveness for agitated dementia remains uncertain. The first meta-analysis on haloperidol's effectiveness for agitated dementia, published in 1990, had a limited scope and failed to provide clear guidelines for its use in demented patients with agitation. Subsequent meta-analyses in 1998 and 2000 compared haloperidol with other neuroleptics and placebo but omitted several databases, including non-English publications. To determine haloperidol's effect compared with placebo in controlling agitated dementia, and to recommend future research directions, a more comprehensive yet focused review was conducted.

- **Objectives**: The main objective was to determine whether evidence supports the use of haloperidol to treat agitation in demented patients.

- **Search strategy**: The CDCIG Specialized Register was searched to identify all available reports on haloperidol treatment for agitated dementia.

- **Selection criteria**: We examined randomized, placebo-controlled trials with concealed allocation, where subjects' dementia and agitation were assessed. Trials with treatment durations of less than one week were excluded.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two reviewers extracted data from included trials.

### Trazodone hydrochloride [^116BtGi7]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2021). High credibility.

Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide).

- **Suicidal thoughts and behaviors**: Advise patients and caregivers to look for the emergence of suicidality, especially early during treatment and when the dosage is adjusted up or down, and instruct them to report such symptoms to the healthcare provider [see Box Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

- **Dosage and administration**: Advise patients that trazodone hydrochloride tablets should be taken shortly following a meal or light snack. Emphasize the importance of following dosage titration instructions [see Dosage and Administration (2)].

- **Serotonin syndrome**: Caution patients about the risk of serotonin syndrome, particularly with the concomitant use of trazodone hydrochloride tablets with other serotonergic drugs, including triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, tryptophan, buspirone, St. John's Wort, and drugs that impair the metabolism of serotonin (specifically, MAOIs, both those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and others, such as linezolid). Patients should contact their healthcare provider or report to the emergency room if they experience signs or symptoms of serotonin syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Drug Interactions (7)].

### The psychopharmacology algorithm project at the Harvard South Shore program: An update on management of behavioral and psychological symptoms in dementia [^113MVxLN]. Psychiatry Research (2021). Low credibility.

Geriatric patients with dementia frequently present with agitation, aggression, psychosis, and other behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD). We present an update of our previously published algorithms for the use of psychopharmacologic agents in these patients, taking into account more recent studies and findings in meta-analyses, reviews, and other published algorithms.

- **Emergent setting**: When intramuscular (IM) administration is necessary, the first-line recommendation is for olanzapine (since IM aripiprazole, previously favored, is no longer available). Haloperidol injection is the second choice, followed by possible consideration of an IM benzodiazepine.

- **Urgent setting**: The first line would be oral second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs) aripiprazole and risperidone. Perhaps next could be prazosin, and lastly, electroconvulsive therapy is a consideration. There are risks associated with these agents, and adverse effects can be severe. Dosing strategies, discontinuation considerations, and side effects are discussed.

- **Non-emergent setting**: Medications are proposed for use in the following order: trazodone, donepezil and memantine, antidepressants such as escitalopram and sertraline, SGAs, prazosin, and carbamazepine. Other options with less support but potential future promise are discussed.

### Pharmacotherapy for behavioural manifestations in frontotemporal dementia: An expert consensus from the European Reference Network for Rare Neurological Diseases (ERN-RND) [^113RYMPj]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Low credibility.

Trazodone, a mixed agonist and antagonist of various serotonin receptors and an antagonist of adrenergic receptors, is a third option often prescribed for neuropsychiatric symptoms in FTD. Trazodone increases extracellular serotonin in the frontal lobes and has been proven to decrease agitation and aggression and to improve sleep in FTD. A randomized controlled trial with trazodone in FTD in a cohort of 26 cases showed a significant improvement in the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) total score, mainly based on improvements in irritability, agitation, depressive symptoms, and eating disorders.

Other medications occasionally considered in behavioural manifestations of FTD include anticonvulsants, stimulants, benzodiazepines, and other antidepressants. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, especially donepezil, frequently used to improve cognitive functioning in Alzheimer's disease, have been proven to worsen neuropsychiatric symptoms without cognitive improvement in patients with FTD in multiple studies. Memantine is also not an effective treatment for FTD.

Altogether, the trial‐based evidence for the symptomatic pharmacological treatment of behavioural disturbances in FTD is scarce despite their significant burden on both patients and caregivers. This expert opinion review aims to provide guidance for the pharmacological treatment of behavioural symptoms that severely impact the patient's and family's well-being.

The symptoms queried were selected based on the clinical expertise of the FTD disease group. They were deliberately meant to be concrete and directly taken from clinical experience rather than abstraction or hypothesis.

### The American Psychiatric Association practice guideline on the use of antipsychotics to treat agitation or psychosis in patients with dementia [^115Px5fY]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2016). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for dementia, particularly concerning the management of agitation, the APA 2016 guidelines recommend discussing the possible tapering of antipsychotics with the patient (if clinically feasible) and with the patient's surrogate decision-maker (if relevant), with input from family or others involved with the patient in the case of a positive response to treatment.

It is important to elicit their preferences and concerns and review the initial goals, observed benefits, and side effects of antipsychotic treatment. Additionally, consider the potential risks of continued exposure to antipsychotics, as well as past experience with antipsychotic medication trials and tapering attempts.

### A European Academy of Neurology guideline on medical management issues in dementia [^116jgK9C]. European Journal of Neurology (2020). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia, specifically concerning antipsychotics, choice of agent, and dosage, the EAN 2020 guidelines recommend considering atypical antipsychotics. Risperidone is suggested as the first-line option over haloperidol when pharmacological treatment is required for agitation or aggressive behavior in patients with dementia and agitation/aggressive behavior.

### Risk of death with atypical antipsychotic drug treatment for dementia: Meta-analysis of randomized placebo-controlled trials [^115gZhha]. JAMA (2005). Low credibility.

Atypical antipsychotic medications are widely used to treat delusions, aggression, and agitation in people with Alzheimer disease and other dementia; however, concerns have arisen about the increased risk for cerebrovascular adverse events, rapid cognitive decline, and mortality with their use.

- **Objective**: To assess the evidence for increased mortality from atypical antipsychotic drug treatment for people with dementia.

- **Data sources**: MEDLINE (1966 to April 2005), the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (2005, Issue 1), meeting presentations (1997–2004), and information from the sponsors were searched using terms for atypical antipsychotic drugs (aripiprazole, clozapine, olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone, and ziprasidone), dementia, Alzheimer disease, and clinical trial.

- **Study selection**: Published and unpublished randomized placebo-controlled, parallel-group clinical trials of atypical antipsychotic drugs marketed in the United States to treat patients with Alzheimer disease or dementia were selected by consensus of the authors.

- **Data extraction**: Trials, baseline characteristics, outcomes, all-cause dropouts, and deaths were extracted by one reviewer; treatment exposure was obtained or estimated, and data were checked by a second reviewer.

- **Data synthesis**: Fifteen trials (9 unpublished), generally 10 to 12 weeks in duration, including 16 contrasts of atypical antipsychotic drugs with placebo, met criteria (aripiprazole [n = 3], olanzapine [n = 5], quetiapine [n = 3], risperidone [n = 5]). A total of 3353 patients were randomized to study drug and 1757 were randomized to placebo.

### The Canadian Coalition for Seniors' Mental Health Canadian clinical practice guidelines for assessing and managing behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) [^1179VArE]. Canadian Geriatrics Journal (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia, particularly concerning benzodiazepines, the CCSMH 2025 guidelines recommend considering the administration of short-acting benzodiazepines for the emergency treatment of severe agitation. This is particularly relevant when there is an imminent risk of physical harm towards oneself or others. It is advised to use these medications on a short-term basis in patients with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias if other medications are unavailable or contraindicated.

### Management of behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia [^112Mq34L]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2019). Low credibility.

We review non-pharmacological and pharmacological approaches to managing behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD). We examine methods for assessment and evidence for interventions, focusing on recent findings and innovations. Finally, we recommend an algorithm for management of BPSD.

- **Recent findings**: Training of formal caregivers is the most effective intervention for BPSD; other non-pharmacological interventions are also beneficial. Antidepressants and antipsychotics remain a mainstay of pharmacological treatment for BPSD. There is limited evidence supporting the use of stimulants, cognitive enhancers, dextromethorphan/quinidine, benzodiazepines, anticonvulsants, and pimavanserin. The management of BPSD is highly individualized. Following thorough assessment, the initial step is addressing contributing medical problems. Non-pharmacological interventions should be tried prior to pharmacological interventions. Antipsychotics should be prescribed only when behaviors pose a significant safety risk or if the person with dementia is very distressed. New approaches will be needed to address an increasing population of people with dementia.

### The effectiveness of atypical antipsychotics for the treatment of aggression and psychosis in Alzheimer's disease [^1111xXVD]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

Aggression, agitation, or psychosis occurs in the majority of people with dementia at some point in the illness. There have been a number of trials of atypical antipsychotics to treat these symptoms over the last five years, and a systematic review is needed to evaluate the evidence in a balanced way.

- **Objectives**: To determine whether evidence supports the use of atypical antipsychotics for the treatment of aggression, agitation, and psychosis in people with Alzheimer's disease.

- **Search strategy**: The trials were identified from a last updated search of the Specialized Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group on 7 December 2004 using the terms olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone, clozapine, amisulpride, sertindole, zotepine, aripiprazole, and ziprasidone. This Register contains articles from all major healthcare databases and many ongoing trials databases and is updated regularly.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised, placebo-controlled trials, with concealed allocation, where dementia and psychosis and/or aggression were assessed.

- **Data collection and analysis**
- Two reviewers extracted data from included trials.
- Data were pooled where possible and analyzed using appropriate statistical methods.
- Analysis included patients treated with an atypical antipsychotic compared with placebo.

- **Main results**: Sixteen placebo-controlled trials have been completed with atypical antipsychotics; however, only nine had sufficient data to contribute to a meta-analysis, and only five have been published in full in peer-reviewed journals. No trials of amisulpiride were included.

### Managing behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) in the era of boxed warnings [^113dVmPP]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2022). Low credibility.

The purpose of this review is to provide a comprehensive overview of the evaluation and management of behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) using evidence from literature.

Recent findings have indicated efficacy for some non-pharmacological techniques, including education of caregivers and cognitive stimulation therapy, and pharmacological agents like antidepressants and antipsychotics for the management of BPSD. However, the use of antipsychotics has generated controversy due to their serious adverse effect profile, which includes the risk of cerebrovascular adverse events and death.

BPSD is associated with the worsening of cognition and function among individuals with dementia, greater caregiver burden, more frequent institutionalization, overall poorer quality of life, and increased cost of caring for these individuals. Future management strategies for BPSD should include the use of technology for the provision of non-pharmacological interventions and the judicious use of cannabinoids and interventional procedures like ECT for the management of refractory symptoms.
