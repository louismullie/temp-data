## Question

What are the effective nonhormonal treatment options for vasomotor symptoms of menopause?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about effective nonhormonal treatments for menopausal vasomotor symptoms, including which options are recommended, which are not, and how to prioritize them in practice. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and why nonhormonal therapy is needed. Then, I should verify which nonhormonal options have the strongest evidence and regulatory status. Next, I will review second-line and emerging options, followed by nonpharmacologic therapies. After that, I need to check what to avoid or deprescribe. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, prioritized approach and note special populations and safety considerations, anchoring to major guidelines and pivotal trials throughout.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and the role of nonhormonal therapy. Vasomotor symptoms affect up to 80% of women during the menopause transition and can persist for a median of 7–9 years, often impairing sleep, mood, and quality of life, which is why effective therapy matters even when hormone therapy is contraindicated or declined [^115YbQnG] [^115q1RCS]. I should confirm that hormone therapy remains the most effective treatment, but for those with contraindications or preference to avoid hormones, nonhormonal options are appropriate and necessary, and I need to ensure I am not overstating their efficacy relative to estrogen therapy [^116nS9ZE] [^116Dvofn].

> Now, I will examine first-line nonhormonal pharmacologic options with the highest-quality evidence. Wait, let me verify the regulatory status first: paroxetine 7.5 mg is the only nonhormonal medication FDA-approved for vasomotor symptoms, and it reduces hot flash frequency by roughly 40–60% versus placebo, with additional sleep benefits including fewer nocturnal awakenings and modest gains in sleep duration, which can be clinically meaningful for patients with prominent night sweats and insomnia [^116Dvofn] [^114C9NVA]. I should double-check the magnitude of benefit and tolerability; pooled phase 3 data support these sleep outcomes and a favorable tolerability profile at the low dose, which is important for adherence [^114C9NVA].

> Next, I should review SSRIs/SNRIs more broadly. Venlafaxine and desvenlafaxine have consistent randomized evidence for reducing VMS frequency by about 40–60% versus placebo, with venlafaxine performing comparably to low-dose estradiol in MsFLASH, albeit with a small advantage favoring estradiol that may not be clinically decisive in all patients [^115fcJFh]. Hold on, I should verify the relative efficacy claim; head-to-head data show venlafaxine's reduction is close to estradiol's, supporting its role when estrogen is not an option, though I must also counsel about common adverse effects like nausea, dry mouth, dizziness, and sexual dysfunction, and I need to avoid paroxetine with tamoxifen due to CYP2D6 inhibition [^115fcJFh] [^116waCcN].

> I will now examine gabapentin, which I initially thought had the most robust nonhormonal evidence; wait, let me reconsider that because I should not conflate quantity with regulatory endorsement. Meta-analytic data show gabapentin reduces hot flash frequency by about 1.6–2.8 per day versus placebo over 4–12 weeks, with clinically relevant improvements in composite scores, but adverse effects such as dizziness and somnolence are common and dose-limiting, which can impair adherence; thus, while effective, it is generally considered after SSRIs/SNRIs or when those are not tolerated or contraindicated [^111kuRd2]. I should confirm that pregabalin has less consistent evidence and is not preferred over gabapentin for VMS at this time [^111kuRd2].

> Let me consider the newest class, neurokinin 3 receptor antagonists. Fezolinetant 45 mg daily is FDA-approved and reduces moderate-to-severe VMS frequency by about 2–3 per day versus placebo within 1–4 weeks, with sustained benefit through 52 weeks and favorable endometrial and bone safety profiles in dedicated long-term trials; network meta-analyses suggest it may outperform other nonhormonal medications and approach some hormone regimens in efficacy, though head-to-head trials are lacking and cost/access may be barriers in some settings [^113YqgTZ] [^111P9xUA] [^111XZCW2] [^112ypU6G]. I should also note elinzanetant, a dual NK1/NK3 antagonist, which showed significant reductions in VMS frequency and severity and improvements in sleep and quality of life in OASIS 1 and 2; however, it is not yet FDA-approved, so it remains investigational for U.S. practice pending regulatory review [^112ywRdJ].

> Next, I should review oxybutynin, an anticholinergic with off-label benefit. Evidence suggests oxybutynin reduces VMS frequency by about 0.5–1 per day versus placebo, with the trade-off of anticholinergic adverse effects; given cognitive risks in older adults with prolonged use, I need to individualize and use the lowest effective dose if chosen, and I should confirm that guidelines place it as a conditional option rather than a first-line agent [^113FNRiL] [^116nS9ZE].

> I will now examine nonpharmacologic therapies. Cognitive behavioral therapy reduces VMS bother and interference and improves coping and sleep quality, with durable benefits in randomized trials, making it a reasonable standalone or adjunctive option, particularly for patients prioritizing non-medication strategies or those with coexisting anxiety or insomnia phenotypes [^116nS9ZE] [^116rdLx9]. Clinical hypnosis shows large reductions in hot flash frequency in a randomized trial, but replication is limited; still, it is a low-risk option that can be considered when accessible and acceptable to patients [^113HS6nh] [^116nS9ZE].

> But wait, what about lifestyle and exercise interventions. I should confirm the strength of evidence before recommending them as treatments. NAMS 2023 concludes there is insufficient or poor evidence that exercise, yoga, paced respiration, or cooling strategies meaningfully reduce VMS frequency or severity, though they are reasonable for general health and symptom coping; weight loss may reduce VMS in some women, but data are limited and heterogeneous, so I should frame it as possible benefit rather than a reliable treatment [^116yMq5o] [^113ABeC9] [^114wwvpd]. Hold on, I should verify that these lifestyle measures are not harmful; they are safe, but expectations should be calibrated to avoid undertreatment of moderate-to-severe VMS [^116yMq5o].

> Next, I should review what to avoid or deprescribe. Supplements and herbal remedies, including black cohosh, isoflavones, red clover, dong quai, ginseng, and vitamin E, have inconsistent or negative randomized data and are not recommended for VMS management; omega-3 fatty acids have mixed results and are likewise not recommended as a treatment for VMS, though they may be used for other health reasons [^117KrdKz]. Acupuncture shows little to no benefit over sham and is not recommended for VMS, and chiropractic interventions lack evidence and are not recommended; clonidine has modest efficacy with considerable adverse effects and is generally not recommended as a nonhormonal option for VMS [^114uoji5] [^117LjsqV] [^113FNRiL]. I need to ensure I communicate that these are not benign if they delay effective care, especially in women with moderate-to-severe symptoms [^116nS9ZE].

> Let me synthesize a practical, prioritized approach. For women who cannot or will not use hormone therapy, start with an SSRI/SNRI such as venlafaxine, desvenlafaxine, or low-dose paroxetine, selecting based on comorbidities, prior response, and patient preference, while screening for drug interactions and counseling on expected benefits and side effects; paroxetine 7.5 mg is the only FDA-approved nonhormonal option and is a strong choice when tamoxifen is not in use [^114C9NVA] [^116waCcN]. If SSRIs/SNRIs are ineffective or not tolerated, consider gabapentin, recognizing dose-limiting sedation and dizziness, or fezolinetant 45 mg daily where available and affordable, given its favorable efficacy and safety profile in phase 3 trials; oxybutynin can be considered cautiously in selected patients, balancing anticholinergic risks [^111kuRd2] [^111P9xUA] [^113FNRiL]. Throughout, incorporate CBT or clinical hypnosis for additional symptom relief and coping, and reassess at 8–12 weeks to determine response and tolerability, adjusting the plan accordingly [^116nS9ZE] [^116rdLx9].

> I should double-check special populations and safety considerations. In breast cancer survivors, avoid systemic estrogen and tibolone; nonhormonal options such as venlafaxine, desvenlafaxine, gabapentin, and fezolinetant are appropriate, with paroxetine avoided if tamoxifen is used; stellate ganglion blockade has emerging but limited evidence and should be reserved for highly selected cases after standard options fail [^113xGxS7] [^116waCcN] [^111wTtZK]. For women with cardiovascular disease or thromboembolic risk, transdermal estrogen may be safer than oral if hormone therapy is ever considered, but nonhormonal therapies remain preferred first-line in higher-risk patients; I need to ensure I align with stroke and cardiovascular risk guidance when advising on any therapy with systemic effects [^1156ZBTF] [^116Dvofn].

> Finally, I need to ensure shared decision-making and expectations are explicit. Nonhormonal therapies typically reduce VMS frequency by about 40–65%, which is meaningful but generally less than the 75% reduction seen with standard-dose estrogen therapy; placebo responses in nonhormonal trials are substantial, so I should set realistic goals and reassess early to avoid therapeutic inertia and to pivot promptly if benefits are not realized [^116Dvofn] [^114nMNRs]. Hold on, I should verify that I have not omitted any key option; the current landscape is well captured by SSRIs/SNRIs, gabapentin, NK3 antagonists, oxybutynin, CBT, and clinical hypnosis, with supplements, acupuncture, and clonidine not recommended for routine VMS treatment based on current evidence [^116nS9ZE].

Nonhormonal treatments for menopausal vasomotor symptoms include **SSRIs/SNRIs** (paroxetine 7.5 mg, venlafaxine, desvenlafaxine), **gabapentinoids** (gabapentin, pregabalin), **clonidine**, and the **NK3 antagonist** fezolinetant [^114nMNRs] [^113YqgTZ]. CBT and clinical hypnosis are effective nonpharmacologic options [^116nS9ZE]. These therapies are appropriate when hormone therapy is contraindicated or declined, with **efficacy and tolerability varying by agent** [^116Dvofn]; fezolinetant offers a novel, nonhormonal option with rapid onset and favorable safety [^111P9xUA] [^111XZCW2].

---

## Pharmacologic treatments

### Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs)

- **Paroxetine 7.5 mg**: FDA-approved for moderate-to-severe VMS; reduces frequency and severity with favorable tolerability [^1163783f] [^114C9NVA].

- **Venlafaxine and desvenlafaxine**: Effective alternatives; venlafaxine 75 mg reduced VMS by ~47% vs 29% placebo in MsFLASH [^115fcJFh].

- **Limitations**: Sexual dysfunction, nausea, insomnia; avoid paroxetine with tamoxifen due to CYP2D6 inhibition [^116waCcN].

---

### Gabapentinoids

Gabapentin and pregabalin reduce VMS frequency and severity, with **gabapentin** supported by meta-analyses and guideline recommendations [^111kuRd2] [^113ZYVuT]. Common adverse effects include dizziness, somnolence, and cognitive effects, which may limit use [^111kuRd2].

---

### Clonidine

Clonidine provides modest benefit but is limited by **dry mouth, dizziness, and sedation**; transdermal patches are preferred for tolerability [^113ZYVuT] [^113FNRiL].

---

### Neurokinin 3 receptor antagonists

Fezolinetant is a **first-in-class NK3 antagonist** [^113YqgTZ] approved in 2023; it reduces VMS frequency/severity with rapid onset and favorable safety, including no endometrial or bone signals in 52-week data [^111P9xUA] [^111XZCW2]. Headache and elevated liver enzymes are the most common adverse effects; monitor LFTs [^111XZCW2] [^113YqgTZ].

---

## Nonpharmacologic treatments

### Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)

CBB reduces VMS **bother and interference** and improves sleep and quality of life, with durable benefits in randomized trials [^116waCcN] [^116rdLx9].

---

### Clinical hypnosis

Clinical hypnosis reduces VMS frequency and severity, with **moderate-quality evidence** supporting its use [^116rdLx9] [^113HS6nh].

---

### Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR)

Evidence for MBSR is **limited and inconsistent**; not currently recommended for VMS [^116nS9ZE] [^114srpH8].

---

## Treatments not recommended due to insufficient evidence

- **Acupuncture**: No consistent benefit vs sham; not recommended [^114uoji5].

- **Supplements**: Black cohosh, soy isoflavones, omega-3s, and vitamin E lack consistent benefit; not recommended [^115umj4z] [^116nS9ZE].

- **Lifestyle**: Exercise, yoga, cooling, and trigger avoidance lack sufficient evidence for VMS; may be used for general health [^113ABeC9] [^116yMq5o].

---

## Comparative efficacy and safety

| **Treatment** | **Efficacy** | **Common adverse effects** | **Recommendation level** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Paroxetine 7.5 mg | High | Sexual dysfunction, nausea | FDA-approved |
| Venlafaxine | Moderate | Nausea, insomnia | Strong |
| Gabapentin | Moderate | Dizziness, somnolence | Strong |
| Fezolinetant | High | Headache, ↑LFTs | FDA-approved |
| CBT | Moderate | None | Strong |
| Clinical hypnosis | Moderate | None | Moderate |

---

## Patient-specific considerations

- **Breast cancer survivors**: Avoid HT; SSRIs/SNRIs, gabapentin, and fezolinetant are options [^113xGxS7] [^116nS9ZE].

- **Cardiovascular risk**: Prefer nonhormonal therapies; avoid systemic estrogen [^116nS9ZE].

- **Patient preference**: Shared decision-making is essential given variability in efficacy and tolerability [^116Dvofn].

---

Nonhormonal options such as SSRIs/SNRIs, gabapentinoids, clonidine, fezolinetant, CBT, and clinical hypnosis provide meaningful VMS relief when hormone therapy is not suitable, with **CBT and fezolinetant** offering favorable efficacy–tolerability profiles.

### Management of menopausal symptoms [^1163783f]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2015). Low credibility.

Most menopausal women experience vasomotor symptoms with bothersome symptoms often lasting longer than one decade. Hormone therapy (HT) represents the most effective treatment for these symptoms with oral and transdermal estrogen formulations having comparable efficacy. Findings from the Women's Health Initiative and other recent randomized clinical trials have helped to clarify the benefits and risks of combination estrogen-progestin and estrogen-alone therapy. Absolute risks observed with HT tended to be small, especially in younger women. Neither regimen increased all-cause mortality rates. Given the lower rates of adverse events on HT among women close to menopause onset and at lower baseline risk of cardiovascular disease, risk stratification and personalized risk assessment appear to represent a sound strategy for optimizing the benefit-risk profile and safety of HT. Systemic HT should not be arbitrarily stopped at age 65 years; instead treatment duration should be individualized based on patients' risk profiles and personal preferences. Genitourinary syndrome of menopause represents a common condition that adversely affects the quality of life of many menopausal women. Without treatment, symptoms worsen over time. Low-dose vaginal estrogen represents highly effective treatment for this condition. Because custom-compounded hormones have not been tested for efficacy or safety, U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved HT is preferred. A low-dose formulation of paroxetine mesylate currently represents the only nonhormonal medication FDA-approved to treat vasomotor symptoms. Gynecologists and other clinicians who remain abreast of data addressing the benefit-risk profile of hormonal and nonhormonal treatments can help menopausal women make sound choices regarding management of menopausal symptoms.

### Nonhormonal management of menopause-associated vasomotor symptoms: 2015 position statement of the North American Menopause Society [^117V3R6d]. Menopause (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

To update and expand The North American Menopause Society's evidence-based position on nonhormonal management of menopause-associated vasomotor symptoms (VMS), previously a portion of the position statement on the management of VMS.

Methods

NAMS enlisted clinical and research experts in the field and a reference librarian to identify and review available evidence. Five different electronic search engines were used to cull relevant literature. Using the literature, experts created a document for final approval by the NAMS Board of Trustees.

Results

Nonhormonal management of VMS is an important consideration when hormone therapy is not an option, either because of medical contraindications or a woman's personal choice. Nonhormonal therapies include lifestyle changes, mind-body techniques, dietary management and supplements, prescription therapies, and others. The costs, time, and effort involved as well as adverse effects, lack of long-term studies, and potential interactions with medications all need to be carefully weighed against potential effectiveness during decision making.

Conclusions

Clinicians need to be well informed about the level of evidence available for the wide array of nonhormonal management options currently available to midlife women to help prevent underuse of effective therapies or use of inappropriate or ineffective therapies. Recommended: Cognitive-behavioral therapy and, to a lesser extent, clinical hypnosis have been shown to be effective in reducing VMS. Paroxetine salt is the only nonhormonal medication approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the management of VMS, although other selective serotonin reuptake/norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, gabapentinoids, and clonidine show evidence of efficacy. Recommend with caution: Some therapies that may be beneficial for alleviating VMS are weight loss, mindfulness-based stress reduction, the S-equol derivatives of soy isoflavones, and stellate ganglion block, but additional studies of these therapies are warranted. Do not recommend at this time: There are negative, insufficient, or inconclusive data suggesting the following should not be recommended as proven therapies for managing VMS: cooling techniques, avoidance of triggers, exercise, yoga, paced respiration, relaxation, over-the-counter supplements and herbal therapies, acupuncture, calibration of neural oscillations, and chiropractic interventions. Incorporating the available evidence into clinical practice will help ensure that women receive evidence-based recommendations along with appropriate cautions for appropriate and timely management of VMS.

### Assessing risks and benefits of nonhormonal treatments for vasomotor symptoms in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women [^115i9f2p]. Journal of Women's Health (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Vasomotor symptoms (VMS); (hot flushes and night sweats) are the most common menopausal complaint for which women seek treatment. Several therapies can be considered to help manage these complaints. The objective of this review is to assess the risks and benefits of available and emerging therapeutic options for the management of menopausal VMS.

Methods

A review of the literature was conducted based on relevant publications identified through a PubMed search for clinical trials of agents used in the treatment of VMS.

Results

Hormone therapy (HT) remains the most effective treatment available, but there will always remain a need for nonhormonal options. Evidence does not support the efficacy of alternative or over-the-counter products, such as phytoestrogens and black cohosh, and their long-term safety is largely unknown. There is evidence supporting the efficacy of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) for the management of VMS from clinical trials of paroxetine, venlafaxine, and desvenlafaxine. Gabapentin appears to be effective, but the doses required may cause poor tolerability and reduced patient adherence. Data also suggest that clonidine has a modest effect at the expense of considerable adverse effects.

Conclusions

Choosing an appropriate treatment approach for the management of VMS requires careful assessment of the riskbenefit ratio of each alternative, as well as individual patient preference.

### The 2023 nonhormone therapy position statement of the North American Menopause Society [^114G5C8R]. Menopause (2023). High credibility.

Hormone therapy for menopausal vasomotor symptoms — hormone therapy remains the most effective treatment and should be considered in menopausal women aged younger than 60 years, within 10 years of their final menstrual periods, and without contraindications; because of hormone therapy contraindications (eg, estrogen-dependent cancers or cardiovascular disease) or personal preference, it is important for healthcare professionals to be well informed about nonhormone treatment options for reducing vasomotor symptoms that are supported by the evidence.

### Treatment of symptoms of the menopause: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^115TEqN9]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2015). Medium credibility.

Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline — treatment of menopausal symptoms states that menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) is the most effective treatment for vasomotor symptoms and other symptoms of the climacteric, and that benefits clearly exceed risks for the majority of symptomatic postmenopausal women who are under age 60 or under 10 years since the onset of menopause. Health care professionals should individualize therapy based on clinical factors and patient preference, and they should screen women before initiating MHT for cardiovascular and breast cancer risk and recommend the most appropriate therapy depending on risk/benefit considerations. Current evidence does not justify the use of MHT to prevent coronary heart disease, breast cancer, or dementia. For those with vasomotor symptoms who prefer not to use MHT or who have contraindications — because these patients should not use MHT — other options are available; for the genitourinary syndrome of menopause, low-dose vaginal estrogen and ospemifene provide effective therapy, and vaginal moisturizers and lubricants are available for those not choosing hormonal therapy. All postmenopausal women should embrace appropriate lifestyle measures.

### Vasomotor symptoms in menopause: physiologic condition and central nervous system approaches to treatment [^116RTwcZ]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

The decline in concentrations of gonadal hormones during menopause gives rise to a range of physiologic and psychologic changes that may impact a woman's health and quality of life significantly. Most notable among these are vasomotor symptoms (hot flashes and night sweats) and mood and sleep disturbances.

Study Design

This article reviews the physiologic condition underlying menopausal vasomotor symptoms and centrally active, nonhormonal therapies that have demonstrated efficacy for their treatment.

Results

Despite the emergence of a range of nonhormonal treatments for vasomotor symptoms, a need still exists for safe and effective therapeutic options that directly target the underlying thermoregulatory mechanisms for women who want treatment but prefer to avoid hormone therapy or for whom hormone therapy is contraindicated.

Conclusion

The availability of centrally active therapies for menopausal vasomotor symptoms with risks and benefits clearly defined by results from well-designed clinical trials has the potential to allay safety concerns that are associated with the treatment of these common symptoms.

### The 2023 nonhormone therapy position statement of the North American Menopause Society [^116nS9ZE]. Menopause (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

To update the evidence-based Nonhormonal Management of Menopause-Associated Vasomotor Symptoms: 2015 Position Statement of The North American Menopause Society.

Methods

An advisory panel of clinicians and research experts in women's health were selected to review and evaluate the literature published since the Nonhormonal Management of Menopause-Associated Vasomotor Symptoms: 2015 Position Statement of The North American Menopause Society. Topics were divided into five sections for ease of review: lifestyle; mind-body techniques; prescription therapies; dietary supplements; and acupuncture, other treatments, and technologies. The panel assessed the most current and available literature to determine whether to recommend or not recommend use based on these levels of evidence: Level I, good and consistent scientific evidence; Level II, limited or inconsistent scientific evidence, and Level III, consensus and expert opinion.

Results

Evidence-based review of the literature resulted in several nonhormone options for the treatment of vasomotor symptoms. Recommended: Cognitive-behavioral therapy, clinical hypnosis, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors/serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, gabapentin, fezolinetant (Level I); oxybutynin (Levels I-II); weight loss, stellate ganglion block (Levels II-III). Not recommended: Paced respiration (Level I); supplements/herbal remedies (Levels I-II); cooling techniques, avoiding triggers, exercise, yoga, mindfulness-based intervention, relaxation, suvorexant, soy foods and soy extracts, soy metabolite equol, cannabinoids, acupuncture, calibration of neural oscillations (Level II); chiropractic interventions, clonidine; (Levels I-III); dietary modification and pregabalin (Level III).

Conclusion

Hormone therapy remains the most effective treatment for vasomotor symptoms and should be considered in menopausal women within 10 years of their final menstrual periods. For women who are not good candidates for hormone therapy because of contraindications (eg, estrogen-dependent cancers or cardiovascular disease) or personal preference, it is important for healthcare professionals to be well informed about nonhormone treatment options for reducing vasomotor symptoms that are supported by the evidence.

### Efficacy and safety of fezolinetant for moderate-severe vasomotor symptoms associated with menopause in individuals unsuitable for hormone therapy: phase 3b randomised controlled trial [^115q1RCS]. BMJ (2024). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Vasomotor symptoms, comprising hot flushes and night sweats, are the most common and bothersome symptoms associated with menopause. Up to 80% of women experience vasomotor symptoms during menopause. Moderate-severe symptoms occur in 11–46% of women older than 40 years, with a median total duration around 7.4 years, whereas the severity of vasomotor symptoms associated with menopause varies throughout the course of menopause and among women.

Although vasomotor symptoms are common and often severe enough to warrant medical treatment, approved and effective non-hormonal treatments are limited. Hormone therapy is effective but not appropriate for everyone. Treatment is contraindicated in women with a history of breast cancer, uterine cancer, active liver disease, or thromboembolic diseases, and caution is advised in those with comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and raised triglyceride levels. Hormone therapy is not suitable for many women, and some choose not to use it.

### Hormonal and nonhormonal treatment of vasomotor symptoms [^115Nu6ke]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

This article focuses on the cause, pathophysiology, differential diagnosis of, and treatment options for vasomotor symptoms. In addition, it summarizes important points for health care providers caring for perimenopausal and postmenopausal women with regard to health maintenance, osteoporosis, cardiovascular disease, and vaginal atrophy. Treatment options for hot flashes with variable effectiveness include systemic hormone therapy (estrogen/progestogen), nonhormonal pharmacologic therapies (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, clonidine, gabapentin), and nonpharmacologic therapy options (behavioral changes, acupuncture). Risks and benefits as well as contraindications for hormone therapy are further discussed.

### Neurokinin receptor antagonists as potential nonhormone treatments for vasomotor symptoms [^111ccUAP]. Menopause (2024). Medium credibility.

Managing menopause symptoms is challenging for women unable or unwilling to take hormone therapy. All nonhormone options thus far have shown less overall efficacy compared with hormone therapy and significant adverse events that limit their use. New science has identified the source of vasomotor symptoms, achieving relief of these bothersome symptoms by directly targeting the neurokinin 3 receptor and its related pathways. This Practice Pearl reviews the clinical data available on neurokinin receptor antagonists.

### Approach to the patient with menopausal symptoms [^112bnvcu]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2008). Low credibility.

Many women experience menopausal symptoms during the menopausal transition and postmenopausal years. Hot flashes, the most common symptom, typically resolve after several years, but for 15–20% of women, they interfere with quality of life. For these women, estrogen therapy, the most effective treatment for hot flashes, should be considered. The decision to use hormone therapy involves balancing the potential benefits of hormone therapy against its potential risks. Accumulating data suggest that initiation of estrogen many years after menopause is associated with excess coronary risk, whereas initiation soon after menopause is not. Therefore, most now agree that short-term estrogen therapy, using the lowest effective estrogen dose, is a reasonable option for recently menopausal women with moderate to severe symptoms who are in good cardiovascular health. Short-term therapy is considered to be not more than 4–5 yr because symptoms diminish after several years, whereas the risk of breast cancer increases with longer duration of hormone therapy. A minority of women may need long-term therapy for severe, persistent vasomotor symptoms after stopping hormone therapy. However, these women should first undergo trials of nonhormonal options such as gabapentin, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, returning to estrogen only if these alternatives are ineffective or cause significant side effects. Low-dose vaginal estrogens are highly effective for genitourinary atrophy symptoms, with minimal systemic absorption and endometrial effects.

Safe and effective nonhormonal treatments for menopausal vasomotor symptoms (VMS) are needed.

Objective

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of elinzanetant, a selective neurokinin-1,3 receptor antagonist, for the treatment of moderate to severe menopausal vasomotor symptoms.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Two randomized double-blind phase 3 trials (OASIS 1 and 2) included postmenopausal participants aged 40 to 65 years experiencing moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms (OASIS 1: 77 sites in the US, Europe, and Israel from August 27, 2021, to November 27, 2023, and OASIS 2: 77 sites in the US, Canada, and Europe from October 29, 2021, to October 10, 2023).

Intervention

Once daily oral elinzanetant, 120 mg, for 26 weeks or matching placebo for 12 weeks followed by elinzanetant, 120 mg, for 14 weeks.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Primary end points included mean change in frequency and severity of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms from baseline to weeks 4 and 12, measured by the electronic hot flash daily diary. Secondary end points included Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System Sleep Disturbance Short Form 8b total T score and Menopause-Specific Quality of Life questionnaire total score from baseline to week 12.

Results

Eligible participants (mean [SD] age, OASIS 1: 54.6 [4.9] years; OASIS 2: 54.6 [4.8] years) were randomized to elinzanetant (OASIS 1: n = 199; OASIS 2: n = 200) or placebo (OASIS 1: n = 197; OASIS 2: n = 200). A total of 309 (78.0%) and 324 (81.0%) completed OASIS 1 and 2, respectively. For the elinzanetant and placebo groups, the baseline mean (SD) VMS per 24 hours were 13.4 (6.6) vs 14.3 (13.9) (OASIS 1) and 14.7 (11.1) v 16.2 (11.2) (OASIS 2). Baseline VMS severity was 2.6 (0.2) vs 2.5 (0.2) (OASIS 1) and 2.5 (0.2) vs 2.5 (0.2) (OASIS 2). Elinzanetant significantly reduced VMS frequency at week 4 (OASIS 1: -3.3 [95% CI, -4.5 to -2.1], P < .001; OASIS 2: -3.0 [95% CI, -4.4 to -1.7], P < .001) and at week 12 (OASIS 1: -3.2 [95% CI, -4.8 to -1.6], P < .001; OASIS 2: -3.2 [95% CI, -4.6 to -1.9], P < .001). Elinzanetant also improved VMS severity at week 4 (OASIS 1: -0.3 [95% CI, -0.4 to -0.2], P < .001; OASIS 2: -0.2 [95 CI, -0.3 to -0.1], P < .001) and week 12 (OASIS 1: -0.4 [95% CI, -0.5 to -0.3], P < .001; OASIS 2: -0.3 [95% CI, -0.4 to -0.1], P < .001). Elinzanetant improved sleep disturbances and menopause-related quality of life at week 12, and the safety profile was favorable.

Conclusions and Relevance

Elinzanetant was well tolerated and efficacious for moderate to severe menopausal VMS.

### Efficacy and safety of gabapentin and pregabalin in patients with vasomotor symptoms: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111kuRd2]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

Vasomotor symptoms are common among postmenopausal women and patients receiving hormone deprivation therapies, and emerging studies are exploring gabapentin's and pregabalin's effects as nonhormonal treatment options. We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of these 2 drugs.

Data Sources

Based on a preregistered protocol (Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews -CRD42019133650), we searched 10 databases (PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, PsycINFO, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, ClinicalTrials.gov, Chinese Biological Medical Literature, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure, Chinese Journals Full-text Database [VIP], and Wanfang) as well as the World Health Organization international clinical trials registry platform and reference lists of related literatures.

Study Eligibility Criteria

Randomized controlled trials and randomized crossover studies exploring gabapentin and pregabalin among women patients with vasomotor symptoms were included.

Study Appraisal and Synthesis Methods

The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis statement was followed. Two reviewers independently selected studies, assessed bias, and extracted data. Mean difference and standardized mean difference with 95% confidence intervals were assessed by random-effects models. Heterogeneities were assessed by I 2 statistics, and the quality of evidence was evaluated by the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach.

Results

Nineteen randomized controlled trials and 2 randomized crossover trials reporting results from 3519 participants were included. Gabapentin could reduce hot flash frequency (mean difference, -1.62, 95% confidence interval, -1.98 to -1.26 after 4 weeks; mean difference, -2.77, 95% confidence interval, -4.29 to -1.24 after 12 weeks) and composite score (standardized mean difference, -0.47, 95% confidence interval, -0.71 to -0.23 after 4 weeks; standardized mean difference, -0.77, 95% confidence interval, -1.15 to -0.40 after 12 weeks) compared with placebo. Both menopausal participants and patients with breast cancer benefited from treatment. Higher risks of dizziness and somnolence were found in the gabapentin group than in the control group (risk ratio, 4.45, 95% confidence interval, 2.50–7.94; risk ratio, 3.29, 95% confidence interval, 1.97–5.48, respectively). Estrogen was more effective in reducing hot flash frequency than gabapentin. No statistically significant difference in reduction of hot flash severity score was found between gabapentin and antidepressants. The trials comparing gabapentin or pregabalin with the other interventions were too limited to make a conclusion.

Conclusion

Favorable effects of gabapentin in relieving vasomotor symptoms were observed, compared with controls, but were less effective than those of estrogen. Evidence supporting the therapeutic effect of pregabalin is still lacking.

METHODS/LITERATURE SEARCH

Eligibility criteria and search methodology

This SLR and Bayesian NMA included data from the SKYLIGHT 1 and 2 trials of fezolinetant (pooled) as well as phase 3 or 4 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of interventions for VMS in postmenopausal women identified via SLR. All studies met prespecified PICOS (population–intervention–comparators–outcomes–study design) inclusion criteria (Table 1). The protocol was not registered on PROSPERO or other registry but is available upon request from Astellas Pharma (see Data Sharing Statement herein).

TABLE 1
Selection of publications for inclusion in the NMA based on PICOS criteria

OvidSP was used to search MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process, EMBASE, The Cochrane Library, the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects, the Health Technology Assessment Database, and the NHS Economic Evaluation Database on June 25, 2021; the specific search strategy is provided in Supplemental Table S1. Additional searches were conducted ofand websites of the European Medicines Agency, US Food and Drug Administration, National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, and the selected congresses (Table 1).

Two independent reviewers screened the search results, first by title and abstract and then by full text; any discrepancies between reviewers were reconciled by both reviewers together and/or a third reviewer, if necessary, to reach a consensus. For individual trials with multiple publications, secondary publications were included only if they reported new, relevant data on outcomes of interest. For any other duplicates, only the most recent data on each outcome were included in the NMA. Study quality was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool.

### Prevalence and impact of vasomotor symptoms due to menopause among women in Canada: a subgroup analysis from an international cross-sectional survey of women with vasomotor symptoms associated with menopause (WARM study) [^116LrCTo]. Menopause (2025). Medium credibility.

The prevalence, severity, and level of bother of vasomotor symptoms (VMS) due to menopause vary around the world. Prevalence of VMS is estimated to range from 41% to 77% in North America. For many of these women, VMS (including hot flashes and/or night sweats) decrease quality of life, interfere with work productivity and daily activities, and disrupt sleep. - The median age of natural menopause in Canada is 51 years. In 2018, approximately 4.4 million of 6.3 million Canadian women aged 40–64 years were employed, suggesting a large population of employed women in perimenopause/postmenopause are potentially affected by VMS.

Most women are not currently treating their VMS, maybe because of a lack of knowledge about treatment options, the belief that menopause is a natural process of aging, or concerns about the side effects and safety of existing pharmaceutical treatments. - Both The Menopause Society and the Society of Obstetricians and Gynecologists of Canada in collaboration with the Canadian Menopause Society guidelines recommend hormone therapy (HT) with estrogen alone (for women who had a hysterectomy) or combined with a progestogen (for women with a uterus) as the most effective option for relief of VMS in women who are younger than 60 years or less than 10 years after their final menstrual period and do not have HT contraindications. - Nonhormone therapies, including antidepressants (ie, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors), gabapentinoids, oxybutynin, clonidine, and neurokinin 3 inhibitors, are recommended when HT is contraindicated or the patient prefers other treatment options; however, many of these treatments may not be as effective as HT. The benefits should be balanced with the potential risks associated with long-term use of HT (eg, breast cancer, stroke, venous thromboembolism, cardiovascular disease) and HT should be individualized based on symptoms, risk factors, and patient preferences. - Although use of supplements, such as natural health products, is not recommended because of limited evidence for effectiveness, many women seeking treatment prefer more natural approaches to their VMS. Fezolinetant is an oral, nonhormone, NK3 receptor antagonist treatment option for moderate to severe VMS and is approved in many countries, including the United States, Europe, and Australia, and in Europe, at a dose of 45 mg once daily. -

Relative efficacy of nonhormonal prescription therapies vs estrogens for VMS: A limited number of head-to-head RCTs have compared varying estrogen doses, preparations, and routes of administration with nonhormonal agents and found no statistically significant superiority of one regimen over another; however, when these and other data are taken into account, the limited evidence available suggests that standard-dose MHT is more effective than nonhormonal agents.

Endocrine Society guideline — nonhormonal prescription therapies for vasomotor symptoms (VMS): For women seeking pharmacological management for moderate to severe VMS for whom menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) is contraindicated, or who choose not to take MHT, we recommend SSRIs/SNRIs or gabapentin or pregabalin (if there are no contraindications). (1|⊕⊕⊕○) For those women not responding to or tolerating these nonhormonal prescription therapies, we suggest a trial of clonidine (if there are no contraindications). (2|⊕⊕○○) Several RCTs demonstrated that clonidine reduced hot flashes, but less effectively than the SSRIs/SNRIs, gabapentin, and pregabalin, and with more side effects, and clonidine transdermal patches are preferred over tablets because of more stable blood levels.

### The menopause transition: signs, symptoms, and management options [^113db1pe]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Context

Menopause, the permanent cessation of menses, reflects oocyte depletion and loss of gonadal steroids. It is preceded by a transition state, the perimenopause, which is characterized by the gradual loss of oocytes, altered responsiveness to gonadal steroid feedback, wide hormonal fluctuations, and irregular menstrual patterns. The goal of this mini-review is to discuss the basic pathophysiology of the menopausal transition and the hormonal and nonhormonal management of clinicopathology attributed to it.

Evidence Acquisition

A Medline search of epidemiologic, population-based studies, and studies of reproductive physiology was conducted. A total of 758 publications were screened.

Evidence Synthesis

The reproductive hormonal milieu of the menopausal transition precipitates bothersome vasomotor symptoms, mood disruption, temporary cognitive dysfunction, genitourinary symptoms, and other disease processes that reduce the quality of life of affected women. The endocrine tumult of the menopause transition also exposes racial and socioeconomic disparities in the onset, severity, and frequency of symptoms. Hormone therapy (HT) treatment can be effective for perimenopausal symptoms but its use has been stymied by concerns about health risks observed in postmenopausal HT users who are older than 60 and/or women who have been postmenopausal for greater than 10 years.

Conclusions

The menopause transition is a disruptive process that can last for over a decade and causes symptoms in a majority of women. It is important for clinicians to recognize early signs and symptoms of the transition and be prepared to offer treatment to mitigate these symptoms. Many safe and effective options, including HT, are available.

### Management of menopause symptoms and quality of life during the menopause transition [^111PALJn]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Some women experience bothersome symptoms around the time of menopause that may have a negative impact on their quality of life and prompt them to seek treatments. Menopausal hormone therapy was historically the treatment of choice. However, medical contraindications and personal preference for nonhormonal therapy have prompted the evaluation of a range of nonhormonal pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic therapies. This review provides an update focusing on the latest evidence-based approach for the management of bothersome symptoms of menopause.

### Treatment of vasomotor symptoms [^115yNocP]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Vasomotor symptoms (VMS) related to the menopausal transition affect the majority of women and contribute to significant quality of life burden. Incidence, length, severity and report of symptoms vary by race, ethnicity, and coexisting health conditions. The pathophysiology of VMS is not fully understood and is likely multifactorial, involving changes in the hypothalamicpituitary-ovarian axis during the menopausal transition. Treatment approaches include lifestyle modifications, hormonal and non-hormonal therapies, including integrative and complementary medicine approaches. Systemic hormone therapy with estrogen is the most effective treatment. Emerging evidence suggests that treatment with SSRIs, SNRIs, and gabapentin is effective for many women who want to avoid hormone therapy. A shared decision approach to treatment decisions involves consideration of risks with treatment options and discussion of patient priorities.

### Management of perimenopausal and menopausal symptoms [^1139iWPf]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

Most women worldwide experience menopausal symptoms during the menopause transition or postmenopause. Vasomotor symptoms are most pronounced during the first four to seven years but can persist for more than a decade, and genitourinary symptoms tend to be progressive. Although the hallmark symptoms are hot flashes, night sweats, disrupted sleep, and genitourinary discomfort, other common symptoms and conditions are mood fluctuations, cognitive changes, low sexual desire, bone loss, increase in abdominal fat, and adverse changes in metabolic health. These symptoms and signs can occur in any combination or sequence, and the link to menopause may even be elusive. Estrogen based hormonal therapies are the most effective treatments for many of the symptoms and, in the absence of contraindications to treatment, have a generally favorable benefit:risk ratio for women below age 60 and within 10 years of the onset of menopause. Non-hormonal treatment options are also available. Although a symptom driven treatment approach with individualized decision making can improve health and quality of life for midlife women, menopausal symptoms remain substantially undertreated by healthcare providers.

### Treatment of menopausal symptoms: what shall we do now? [^113woa1M]. Lancet (2005). Excellent credibility.

During the past few years, many women and doctors have revised their opinions of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) for menopausal symptoms, and a substantial number of individuals have discontinued its use because of concerns about side-effects. Numerous alternatives to HRT are promoted, and assessment of the quality of evidence about the safety and effectiveness of these compounds can be difficult. In this Review, we summarise the data from studies addressing the efficacy, risks, and benefits of frequently prescribed treatments, and offer evidence-based clinical guidelines for the management of menopausal symptoms. Although few comparative studies exist, oestrogen alone or combinations of oestrogen and progestagen are likely to be the most effective treatments for menopausal hot flushes and vaginal dryness. Tibolone is as effective as HRT, however, and might also improve libido. For those who wish to avoid hormonal treatments, there are few effective options. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors might be effective in the very short term (less than 12 weeks) and are well tolerated. There is not enough evidence that any of the complementary therapies available are any better than placebo for menopausal vasomotor symptoms, and few safety data exist.

### Systematic review and network meta-analysis comparing the efficacy of fezolinetant with hormone and nonhormone therapies for treatment of vasomotor symptoms due to menopause [^112ypU6G]. Menopause (2024). Medium credibility.

Importance

The neurokinin 3 receptor antagonist fezolinetant 45 mg/d significantly reduced frequency/severity of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms (VMS) of menopause compared with placebo in two phase 3 randomized controlled trials. Its efficacy relative to available therapies is unknown.

Objective

We conducted a systematic review and Bayesian network meta-analysis to compare efficacy with fezolinetant 45 mg and hormone therapy (HT) and non-HT for VMS in postmenopausal women.

Evidence Review

Using OvidSP, we systematically searched multiple databases for phase 3 or 4 randomized controlled trials in postmenopausal women with ≥ 7 moderate to severe VMS per day or ≥ 50 VMS per week published/presented in English through June 25, 2021. Mean change in frequency and severity of moderate to severe VMS from baseline to week 12 and proportion of women with ≥ 75% reduction in VMS frequency at week 12 were assessed using fixed-effect models.

Findings

The network meta-analysis included data from the pooled phase 3 fezolinetant trials plus 23 comparator publications across the outcomes analyzed (frequency, 19 [34 regimens]; severity, 6 [7 regimens]; ≥ 75% response, 9 [15 regimens]). Changes in VMS frequency did not differ significantly between fezolinetant 45 mg and any of the 27 HT regimens studied. Fezolinetant 45 mg reduced the frequency of moderate to severe VMS events per day significantly more than all non-HTs evaluated: paroxetine 7.5 mg (mean difference [95% credible interval {CrI}], 1.66 [0.63–2.71]), desvenlafaxine 50 to 200 mg (mean differences [95% CrI], 1.12 [0.10–2.13] to 2.16 [0.90–3.40]), and gabapentin ER 1800 mg (mean difference [95% CrI], 1.63 [0.48–2.81]), and significantly more than placebo (mean difference, 2.78 [95% CrI], 1.93–3.62]). Tibolone 2.5 mg (the only HT regimen evaluable for severity) significantly reduced VMS severity compared with fezolinetant 45 mg. Fezolinetant 45 mg significantly reduced VMS severity compared with desvenlafaxine 50 mg and placebo and did not differ significantly from higher desvenlafaxine doses or gabapentin ER 1800 mg. For ≥ 75% responder rates, fezolinetant 45 mg was less effective than tibolone 2.5 mg (not available in the United States) and conjugated estrogens 0.625 mg/bazedoxifene 20 mg (available only as 0.45 mg/20 mg in the United States), did not differ significantly from other non-HT regimens studied and was superior to desvenlafaxine 50 mg and placebo.

Conclusions

The only HT regimens that showed significantly greater efficacy than fezolinetant 45 mg on any of the outcomes analyzed are not available in the United States. Fezolinetant 45 mg once daily was statistically significantly more effective than other non-HTs in reducing the frequency of moderate to severe VMS.

Relevance

These findings may inform decision making with regard to the individualized management of bothersome VMS due to menopause.

### Treatment of menopause-associated vasomotor symptoms: position statement of the North American Menopause Society [^1146x4zw]. Menopause (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To create an evidence-based position statement regarding the treatment of vasomotor symptoms associated with menopause.

Design

The North American Menopause Society (NAMS) enlisted clinicians and researchers acknowledged to be experts in the field of menopause-associated vasomotor symptoms to review the evidence obtained from the medical literature and develop a document for final approval by the NAMS Board of Trustees.

Results

For mild hot flashes, lifestyle-related strategies such as keeping the core body temperature cool, participating in regular exercise, and using paced respiration have shown some efficacy without adverse effects. Among nonprescription remedies, clinical trial results are insufficient to either support or refute efficacy for soy foods and isoflavone supplements (from either soy or red clover), black cohosh, or vitamin E; however, no serious side effects have been associated with short-term use of these therapies. Single clinical trials have found no benefit for dong quai, evening primrose oil, ginseng, a Chinese herbal mixture, acupuncture, or magnet therapy. Few data support the efficacy of topical progesterone cream; safety concerns should be the same as for other progestogen preparations. No clinical trials have been conducted on the use of licorice for hot flashes. Among nonhormonal prescription options, the antidepressants venlafaxine, paroxetine, and fluoxetine and the anticonvulsant gabapentin have demonstrated some efficacy for treating hot flashes and were well tolerated. Two antihypertensive agents, clonidine and methyldopa, have shown modest efficacy but with a relatively high rate of adverse effects. For moderate to severe hot flashes, systemic estrogen therapy, either alone (ET) or combined with progestogen (EPT) or in the form of estrogen-progestin oral contraceptives, has been shown to significantly reduce hot flash frequency and severity. Clinical trials have associated ET/EPT with adverse effects, including breast cancer, stroke, and thromboembolism. Several progestogens (both oral and intramuscular formulations) have shown efficacy in treating hot flashes, including women with a history of breast cancer, although no definitive data are available on long-term safety in these women.

Conclusions

In women who need relief for mild vasomotor symptoms, NAMS recommends first considering lifestyle changes, either alone or combined with a nonprescription remedy, such as dietary isoflavones, black cohosh, or vitamin E. Prescription systemic estrogen-containing products remain the therapeutic standard for moderate to severe menopause-related hot flashes. Recommended options for women with concerns or contraindications relating to estrogen-containing treatments include prescription progestogens, venlafaxine, paroxetine, fluoxetine, or gabapentin. Clinicians are advised to enlist women's participation in decision making when weighing the benefits, harms, and scientific uncertainties of therapeutic options. Regardless of the management strategy adopted, treatment should be periodically reassessed as menopause-related vasomotor symptoms will abate over time without any intervention in most women.

Data extraction

One reviewer manually extracted data from the included full-text publications; a second reviewer validated the extracted data for accuracy. Any discrepancies were reconciled by both reviewers together and/or a third reviewer, if necessary. Various characteristics of each publication, trial, and study population were extracted. Efficacy outcomes extracted for use in the NMA included mean change from baseline to week 12 in frequency and severity of moderate to severe VMS and the proportion of participants with ≥ 75% reduction from baseline in VMS frequency at 12 weeks. Key information related to each outcome was also extracted (eg, timing of assessment, mathematical definition, scale of outcome). Missing, unclear, or insufficient data were denoted as "NR" (not reported), and no assumptions were made around it.

Feasible networks for the NMA were those for which sufficient information was available for analysis of a commonly defined outcome measured at comparable time points across a connected network of trials. Publications reporting outcome definitions comparable to those used in the SKYLIGHT trials were deemed appropriate for inclusion. VMS frequency was defined as the sum of moderate and severe VMS events per day. VMS severity was calculated using a weighted average that captures all VMS, including those of mild severity: ([number of mild hot flashes per day × 1] + [number of moderate hot flashes per day × 2] + [number of severe hot flashes per day × 3])/total number of daily mild/moderate/severe hot flashes. The VMS ≥ 75% responder rate was defined as the proportion of participants with at least a ≥ 75% reduction from baseline in moderate to severe VMS frequency at 12 weeks.

### Efficacy and safety of fezolinetant in moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms associated with menopause: a phase 3 RCT [^111P9xUA]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Herein we demonstrate that fezolinetant, a novel nonhormonal treatment for VMS, is effective and safe in reducing this cardinal symptom of menopause by over 50% from baseline. The study successfully met the 4 coprimary efficacy endpoints. Both doses demonstrated statistically significant improvements vs placebo in mean daily VMS frequency and severity at weeks 4 and 12. These results suggest that fezolinetant is efficacious for treatment of moderate to severe VMS at daily doses of 30 and 45 mg. Efficacy of fezolinetant was seen within the first week of treatment and was maintained through week 12, with a daily reduction of 2 to 3 VMS episodes from baseline to week 12 compared with placebo. Efficacy was persistent and reductions in VMS frequency were maintained during the 40-week extension period, at levels consistent with the results of the initial 12 weeks. These results confirm those of phase 2 trials, which showed significant reductions in total VMS score, and mean frequency of moderate to severe VMS, and significant improvements in QoL measures at week 12 vs placebo. At week 12, the LS mean reduction in VMS frequency was greater than 50% in both fezolinetant groups, and a 50% reduction is considered clinically significant. Additionally, persistence of efficacy was observed during the 52-week treatment period.

RESULTS

Studies selected for NMA

Of the 2,372 publications identified and screened in the initial search, the NMA included data from the 2 pooled phase 3 SKYLIGHT trials of fezolinetant, plus 23 publications of comparators (Fig. 1).- One publication met the eligibility criteria otherwise but was excluded owing to lack of a common comparator arm to connect it to the network. In addition to the 2 SKYLIGHT trials, 19 publications provided data on VMS frequency at 12 weeks (detailed in Supplemental Table S3,),-,-,-,-,- 6 contributed data to the VMS severity analysis (Supplemental Table S4,),-, and 9 contributed data on ≥ 75% responder rate at week 12 (Supplemental Table S5). Overall, included studies were deemed to have a low risk of selection bias, and as well-conducted RCTs, all studies provided level 1 evidence (Supplemental Table S6).

### Treatment of symptoms of the menopause: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^115umj4z]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2015). Medium credibility.

Nonhormonal therapies for vasomotor symptoms (VMS) — For postmenopausal women with mild or less bothersome hot flashes, we suggest a series of steps that do not involve medication, such as turning down the thermostat, dressing in layers, avoiding alcohol and spicy foods, and reducing obesity and stress. For women seeking pharmacological management for moderate to severe VMS for whom MHT is contraindicated or who choose not to take MHT, we recommend selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)/serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) or gabapentin or pregabalin if there are no contraindications, and for those not responding to or tolerating these therapies, we suggest a trial of clonidine if there are no contraindications. For women seeking relief of VMS with over-the-counter (OTC) or complementary medicine therapies, we suggest counseling regarding the lack of consistent evidence for benefit for botanicals, black cohosh, omega-3-fatty acids, red clover, vitamin E, and mind/ body alternatives including anxiety control, acupuncture, paced breathing, and hypnosis.

### Menopausal hormone therapy and menopausal symptoms [^11112nGf]. Fertility and Sterility (2014). Low credibility.

A majority of women will experience bothersome symptoms related to declining and/or fluctuating levels of estrogen during their menopausal transition. Vasomotor symptoms, vaginal dryness, poor sleep, and depressed mood have all been found to worsen during the menopausal transition. While vasomotor symptoms gradually improve after menopause, the time course can be many years. Vaginal dryness does not improve without treatment, while the long-term course of sleep and mood deterioration is not clearly defined at this time. A small minority of women have vasomotor symptoms that persist throughout the remainder of their lives. These common menopausal symptoms all improve with estrogen treatment. Over the last 10 years, we have witnessed a dramatic reduction in enthusiasm for menopausal hormone therapy, despite its high efficacy relative to other treatments. We have also seen the emergence of sound, evidence-based clinical trials of non-hormonal alternatives that can control the common menopausal symptoms. Understanding the natural history of menopausal symptoms, and the risks and benefits of both hormonal and non-hormonal alternatives, helps the clinician individualize management plans to improve quality of life.

### Efficacy and safety of fezolinetant in moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms associated with menopause: a phase 3 RCT [^116yowfJ]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Hormone therapy is considered a standard of care for menopausal symptoms, although it may not be suitable for, or preferred by, all women. Currently, nonhormonal treatments include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, clonidine, gabapentin, oxybutynin, and paroxetine, the only nonhormonal therapy approved by the FDA for VMS. NK3R antagonists offer a new selective therapeutic approach and various candidates have been advanced into clinical development. Fezolinetant is under development as a nonhormonal treatment option for moderate to severe VMS associated with menopause.

In summary, fezolinetant 30 and 45 mg once daily demonstrated efficacy and were well tolerated for treatment of moderate to severe VMS associated with menopause. There was a rapid onset of effect by week 1, with a full effect by week 4 that was sustained through 52 weeks with a daily reduction of 2 to 3 VMS episodes more than placebo from baseline to week 12 for fezolinetant groups. In addition, fezolinetant 45 mg significantly improved patient-reported sleep. These findings support continued development of fezolinetant as a novel nonhormonal treatment option for VMS associated with menopause.

### Low-dose estradiol and the serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor venlafaxine for vasomotor symptoms: a randomized clinical trial [^115fcJFh]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2014). Medium credibility.

Importance

Estrogen therapy is the gold standard treatment for hot flashes and night sweats, but some women are unable or unwilling to use it because of associated risks. The serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor venlafaxine hydrochloride is used widely as a nonhormonal treatment. While the clinical impression is that serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors are less effective than estrogen, these medications have not been simultaneously evaluated in one clinical trial to date.

Objective

To determine the efficacy and tolerability of low-dose oral 17β-estradiol and low-dose venlafaxine extended release in alleviating vasomotor symptoms (VMS).

Design, Setting, and Participants

In total, 339 perimenopausal and postmenopausal women with at least 2 bothersome VMS per day (mean, 8.1 per day) were recruited from the community to MsFLASH (Menopause Strategies: Finding Lasting Answers for Symptoms and Health) clinical network sites between December 5, 2011, and October 15, 2012.

Interventions

Participants were randomized to double-blind treatment with low-dose oral 17β-estradiol (0.5 mg/d) (n = 97), low-dose venlafaxine hydrochloride extended release (75 mg/d) (n = 96), or placebo (n = 146) for 8 weeks.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was the mean daily frequency of VMS after 8 weeks of treatment. Secondary outcomes were VMS severity, bother, and interference with daily life. Intent-to-treat analyses compared the change in VMS frequency between each active intervention and placebo and between the 2 active treatments.

Results

Compared with baseline, the mean VMS frequency at week 8 decreased to 3.9 (95% CI, 2.9–4.9) VMS per day (52.9% reduction) in the estradiol group, to 4.4 (95% CI, 3.5–5.3) VMS per day (47.6% reduction) in the venlafaxine group, and to 5.5 (95% CI, 4.7–6.3) VMS per day (28.6% reduction) in the placebo group. Estradiol reduced the frequency of symptoms by 2.3 more per day than placebo (P < .001), and venlafaxine reduced the frequency of symptoms by 1.8 more per day than placebo (P = .005). The results were consistent for VMS severity, bother, and interference. Low-dose estradiol reduced the frequency of symptoms by 0.6 more per day than venlafaxine (P = .09). Treatment satisfaction was highest (70.3%) for estradiol (P < .001 vs placebo), lowest (38.4%) for placebo, and intermediate (51.1%) for venlafaxine (P = .06 vs placebo). Both interventions were well tolerated.

Conclusions and Relevance

Low-dose oral estradiol and venlafaxine are effective treatments for VMS in women during midlife. While the efficacy of low-dose estradiol may be slightly superior to that of venlafaxine, the difference is small and of uncertain clinical relevance.

Trial Registration

clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT01418209.

### Treatment satisfaction, unmet needs, and new treatment expectations for vasomotor symptoms due to menopause: women's and physicians' opinions [^112PEDUP]. Menopause (2024). Medium credibility.

Menopause refers to the cessation of ovarian function and 12 consecutive months of amenorrhea, with typical age at onset between 49 and 52 years (median age 51 y). - Demographic and environmental factors, such as race, ethnicity, and personal lifestyle, however, can modify age at onset. -

Over a period of approximately 2 years (range: 1–3 y), hormonal fluctuations and changes in the menstrual pattern occur. During this time, women may experience a variety of symptoms, including disturbances in sleep, cognition, sexual functioning, and vulvovaginal, psychological, and vasomotor symptoms (VMS). Primarily characterized by hot flashes and night sweats, VMS affect up to 80% of women during menopause and may persist for up to 7 to 10 years.- Previous studies have linked VMS to reductions in health-related quality of life and economic burden on women.VMS have also been associated with negative effects on women's quality of life, including poor self-reported sleep, fatigue, anxiety, and depression, resulting in social isolation and embarrassment, disrupted relationships, reduced work productivity, and an inability to carry out day-to-day activities.

Women have sought relief from VMS using hormone therapies (HTs), nonhormone therapies (non-HTs), and over-the-counter (OTC) treatments. HTs, which include estrogen, estrogen derivatives, and combination therapies with estrogen, have been the gold standard for women experiencing VMS; progestogens, a general category that includes synthetic progestins and progesterone, are commonly coadministered with estrogen. Estrogen alone and in combination with other compounds have reduced weekly symptom frequency by up to 75% and have been considered to be the most effective treatments for VMS. However, the long-term use of these therapies can increase the risk of venous thromboembolism, stroke, dementia, gallbladder disease, and some types of cancer. Estrogen administered by different routes, such as transdermal patches and topical gels, has also been made available to mitigate the effects of systemic oral therapies in women at high risk, although evidence of the risks of cardiovascular or neurologic events or cancer associated with estrogen in different formulations is lacking.

### Exercise for vasomotor menopausal symptoms [^115RG2SG]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Evidence suggests that a high proportion of perimenopausal and early postmenopausal women will experience some menopause symptoms, hot flushes being the most common. The effects caused by falling levels of estrogen may be alleviated by hormone replacement therapy (HRT) but there has been a marked global decline in the prescription and use of HRT due to concerns about the risks and benefits of HRT; consequently many women are now seeking alternatives. As large numbers of women are choosing not to take HRT, it is increasingly important to identify evidence based lifestyle modifications, which can have a positive effect on menopausal symptoms.

Objectives

To examine the effectiveness of any type of exercise intervention in the management of vasomotor menopausal symptoms (hot flushes and night sweats) in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women.

Search Strategy

Searches of the following electronic bibliographic databases were performed to identify randomised controlled trials: The Cochrane Library (CENTRAL) (Wiley Internet interface) 2006 Issue 2, MEDLINE (Ovid) 1966-May week 4 2006, EMBASE (Ovid) 1980-week 21 2006, PsycINFO (Ovid) 1967-May week 5 2006, Science Citation Index and Social Science Citation Index (Web of Science) 1900-June 2006 and 1956-June 2006 respectively, CINAHL (Ovid) 1982-May week 4 2006, SPORT Discus (ERL WebSPIRS) 1830–2006/04.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in which any type of exercise intervention was compared to other treatments or no treatment in the management of menopausal vasomotor symptoms in symptomatic perimenopausal and postmenopausal women.

Data Collection and Analysis

Nineteen reports were deemed potentially eligible, but of these only one met the inclusion criteria and three authors independently extracted data from this trial.

Main Results

Only one very small trial, which compared exercise with HRT, was available for inclusion in this review. Based on within-group analyses the study authors concluded that both interventions were effective in reducing vasomotor symptoms. Between-group trial analyses conducted by reviewers showed that the HRT group experienced significantly fewer hot flushes compared to the exercise group at follow-up.

Authors' Conclusions

Only one very small trial involving symptomatic women has assessed the effectiveness of exercise in the management of vasomotor menopausal symptoms. Exercise was not as effective as HRT in this trial. We found no evidence from randomised controlled trials on whether exercise is an effective treatment relative to other interventions or no intervention in reducing hot flushes and or night sweats in symptomatic women. No conclusions regarding the effectiveness of exercise as a treatment for vasomotor menopausal symptoms could be made due to a lack of trials.

### Safety of fezolinetant for vasomotor symptoms associated with menopause: a randomized controlled trial [^112MNh3A]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2023). Medium credibility.

Worldwide, most women aged 40–64 years old experience vasomotor symptoms (eg, hot flushes, night sweats) associated with menopause. Moderate-to-severe vasomotor symptoms are reported by 34% of postmenopausal individuals in the United States, 40% in Europe, and 16% in Japan; 9.6% of Latin Americanand 11.4% of Australianwomen report severe or bothersome vasomotor symptoms. Vasomotor symptoms can also have substantial effects on quality of life by affecting sleep, mood, and cognitive functioning and contributing to social impairment, work-related difficulties, anxiety, and fatigue. –

Menopausal hormone therapy is an effective choice for vasomotor symptoms but is not appropriate for everyone. Fezolinetant, in development for the treatment of moderate-to-severe vasomotor symptoms associated with menopause, is a nonhormonal, selective neurokinin 3 receptor antagonist that blocks neurokinin B binding on the kisspeptin/neurokinin B/dynorphin neurons in the hypothalamus to moderate neuronal activity in the thermoregulatory center. – Phase 2 studies demonstrated a reduction in vasomotor symptom frequency and severity after fezolinetant treatment, with improvements in health-related quality of life. Results from two replicate double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 studies (SKYLIGHT [Study to Find Out if Fezolinetant Helps Reduce Moderate to Severe Hot Flashes in Women Going Through Menopause] 1 [NCT04003155] and SKYLIGHT 2 [NCT04003142]) showed that fezolinetant 30 and 45 mg met statistical significance in reducing vasomotor symptom frequency and severity at weeks 4 and 12 compared with placebo, with reduction persisting over 52 weeks. Over the 12-week double-blind period, there was a low incidence of individual treatment-emergent adverse events, and few serious treatment-emergent adverse events were noted with fezolinetant treatment. SKYLIGHT 4 (Study to Find Out How Safe Long-term Treatment With Fezolinetant is in Women With Hot Flashes Going Through Menopause) was conducted to provide 52-week, placebo-controlled safety data in a large cohort, with a focus on endometrial safety.

### 2024 guideline for the primary prevention of stroke: a guideline from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^1156ZBTF]. Stroke (2024). High credibility.

Menopause, vasomotor symptoms, and hormone therapy — stroke and cardiovascular disease risk are outlined as follows: Premature menopause (onset before 40 years of age) and early menopause (before 45 years of age) are described, and reproductive life span if < 30 years has been identified as a potential risk factor for stroke. More than 50% of women experience frequent vasomotor symptoms during the menopausal period, and severe and frequent symptoms are associated with an increased risk of CVD, although whether vasomotor symptoms are independently associated with the risk of stroke is uncertain. Estrogen-based therapies are the most effective treatments for moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms; however, HT, particularly oral HT, has been associated with risk of CVD in multiple RCTs and meta-analyses, and topical estrogen treatments are not associated with stroke risk. Approximately 5% of women experience a natural menopause before 45 years of age.

Consideration of a new non-HT for VMS/expectations for new VMS treatments

Both women and physicians would consider trying a new oral non-HT for VMS (75.8% and 75.9%, respectively) if it offered better symptom control and fewer long-term safety concerns than current treatments. Women most valued when the new treatment could improve sleep quality (59.6%) and reduce severity (59.4%) and frequency (57.9%) of VMS. Physicians most valued when the new treatment could reduce severity (67.2%) and frequency (60.4%) of VMS and have a better safety profile (56.0%) (Fig. 3).

CONCLUSIONS

In this study of postmenopausal women experiencing moderate/severe VMS, treatment with fezolinetant significantly improved responder rates and PRO measures of daily life interference, associated symptoms, and health-related quality of life. The body of clinical data accrued for fezolinetant warrant proceeding to further studies of longer treatment duration and a larger treated population. Such studies should include comprehensive evaluation of PROs to fully assess the potential benefits of this nonhormone therapy for menopause-related VMS.

### Managing menopausal symptoms and associated clinical issues in breast cancer survivors [^113xGxS7]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

Review evidence to guide management of menopausal signs and symptoms in women after breast cancer and make recommendations accordingly.

Evidence

Randomized controlled clinical trials, observational studies, evidence-based guidelines, and expert opinion from professional societies.

Background

Symptoms and clinical problems associated with estrogen depletion-sleep disorders, vulvovaginal atrophy (VVA), vasomotor symptoms (VMS), mood changes, depressive symptoms, cardiovascular disease, osteopenia, and osteoporosis-confront the estimated 9.3 million breast cancer survivors globally.

Recommendations

Following breast cancer, women should not generally be treated with menopausal hormone therapy or tibolone but should optimize lifestyle. Women with moderate to severe symptoms may benefit from mind-brain behavior or nonhormone, pharmacologic therapy. The selective serotonin/noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors and gabapentenoid agents improve VMS and quality of life. For osteoporosis, nonhormonal agents are available. Treatment of VVA remains an area of unmet need. Low-dose vaginal estrogen is absorbed in small amounts with blood levels remaining within the normal postmenopausal range but could potentially stimulate occult breast cancer cells, and although poorly studied, is not generally advised, particularly for those on aromatase inhibitors. Intravaginal dehydroepiandrosterone and oral ospemiphene have been approved to treat dyspareunia, but safety after breast cancer has not been established. Vaginal laser therapy is being used for VVA but efficacy from sham-controlled studies is lacking. Therapies undergoing development include lasofoxifene, neurokinin B inhibitors, stellate ganglion blockade, vaginal testosterone, and estetrol.

Conclusions

Nonhormone options and therapies are available for treatment of estrogen depletion symptoms and clinical problems after a diagnosis of breast cancer. Individualization of treatment is essential.

### Systematic review and network meta-analysis comparing the efficacy of fezolinetant with hormone and nonhormone therapies for treatment of vasomotor symptoms due to menopause [^1135npxW]. Menopause (2024). Medium credibility.

Statistical analyses

A Bayesian approach to NMA allowed for synthesis of direct and indirect evidence using 12-week efficacy measures. The NMA was conducted using 20,000 burn-in iterations and an additional 30,000 sampling iterations to generate posterior distributions for the treatment effects. Noninformative priors were selected to avoid artificially biasing the results and to ensure maximal objectivity. Continuous outcomes were modeled using normal distributions for the likelihood of function, and categorical outcomes were modeled using binomial distributions with logit link. A posterior probability distribution was generated for each efficacy outcome to carry out pairwise comparisons of treatment regimens.

Treatment effects were compared using mean treatment differences for continuous outcomes and mean odds ratios for categorical outcomes. Comparative estimates were summarized using posterior mean; associated 95% credible intervals (CrIs) were used to evaluate uncertainty of the estimates. Although Bayesian 95% CrIs are analogous to frequentist confidence intervals (CIs), their interpretations differ. CrIs allow for probabilistic interpretation directly from the estimated population distribution, whereas a frequentist approach uses a hypothetical sampling distribution. Although a 95% CI represents the range within which an estimate may fall (ie, we are 95% certain that this interval contains the true estimate), a CrI represents the range containing a percentage of probable values for an estimate (ie, there is a 95% probability that the true estimate lies within that interval). Determination of whether the difference between two comparators was statistically significant was based on whether the 95% CrI crossed 0 for continuous outcomes or 1 for categorical outcomes.

### Managing menopausal symptoms: common questions and answers [^116waCcN]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

Menopausal symptoms are widespread and significantly impact quality of life. Common symptoms of menopause are vasomotor (i.e., hot flashes and night sweats) and genitourinary (e.g., vulvovaginal irritation and dryness, dyspareunia, urinary problems), although women may also experience changes in sexual function, mood, and sleep. Estrogen-containing hormone therapy is effective treatment for vasomotor symptoms. Nonhormonal medications for vasomotor symptoms include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, and gabapentin. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors should not be administered to women taking tamoxifen. Cognitive behavior therapy and clinical hypnosis are effective for short-term reduction of vasomotor symptoms and associated sleep disturbances, but data are lacking to support the effectiveness of other nonpharmacologic treatments such as herbal or botanicalsupplements, exercise, and acupuncture. Hormone-free vaginal moisturizers are noninferior to estrogen-based therapies for treating genitourinary syndrome of menopause. Other treatment options for vaginal dryness and dyspareunia associated with menopause include ospemifene and intravaginal dehydroepiandrosterone. Management of menopausal symptoms should involve shared decision-making that is informed by the best available evidence and individual risks and preferences.

### Moderate to severe vasomotor and sexual symptoms remain problematic for women aged 60 to 65 years [^113xRcqW]. Menopause (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

This study aims to determine the prevalence and severity of menopausal symptoms in older postmenopausal women and, hence, the need for treatment options for women of this age.

Methods

This is a cross-sectional questionnaire-based study conducted between October 2013 and March 2014 among 2,020 women aged 40 to 65 years and living independently across Australia. The main outcome measures were the prevalence of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms (VMS), as measured by the Menopause-Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire, and the current use of prescription therapy for menopausal symptoms.

Results

The prevalence of moderate to severe VMS was as follows: 2.8% in premenopausal women, 17.1% in perimenopausal women, 28.5% in postmenopausal women younger than 55 years, 15.1% in postmenopausal women aged 55 to 59 years, and 6.5% in postmenopausal women aged 60 to 65 years. Prescription therapy for menopausal symptoms was used by 135 women: 120 (5.9%) women using hormone therapy and 15 (0.7%) women using nonhormonal medication. The factors positively associated with moderate to severe VMS were smoking (odds ratio, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.1–2.3; P < 0.05) and a body mass index of 25 to 29.9kg/m (odds ratio, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.1–2.5; P < 0.05); education beyond high school was inversely associated (odds ratio, 0.7; 95% CI, 0.5–0.9; P < 0.05).

Conclusions

In this large, representative, community-based sample of women, there is a high prevalence of untreated moderate to severe VMS even in women aged 60 to 65 years. The use of vaginal estrogen and nonhormonal prescription therapy with proven efficacy for treatment of menopausal symptoms is strikingly low, suggesting that menopause remains an undertreated condition.

### Treatment of symptoms of the menopause: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^112VASo5]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2015). Medium credibility.

Menopausal symptoms and ET/MHT — clinical background: VMS, hot flashes, and night sweats, are the hallmarks of menopause, although not all women experience these symptoms. Symptoms frequently start in the years before the final menstrual period and can last, with unpredictable duration, from a few years to more than 13 years. ET has long been recognized as the most effective treatment for the relief of bothersome vasomotor and vaginal symptoms associated with menopause. During ensuing years, a consensus arose that most healthy symptomatic women, without contraindications and closer to the time of menopause (< 10 y after menopause onset or age < 60 y), were appropriate candidates for MHT for symptom relief, and post hoc WHI analyses and observational data suggest that benefits exceed risks in most of these women.

### Should urogenital atrophy in breast cancer survivors be treated with topical estrogens? [^111NsPKQ]. The Oncologist (2008). Low credibility.

Breast cancer survivors represent a unique patient population with a high prevalence of menopausal symptoms. Given the improved longevity of cancer patients, the consequences of menopause have become an increasingly important and challenging management issue. To date, considerable attention has been paid to the management of menopausal vasomotor symptoms and bone health among breast cancer patients. As a result, numerous nonhormonal treatment options have been developed for the management of these issues. The treatment of urogenital symptoms among this population is poorly understood and relatively understudied. Although systemic or topical estrogen replacement is the most effective method for treating hypoestrogenic urogenital symptoms, women with a prior diagnosis of breast cancer are cautioned from taking exogenous estrogens in order to avoid a potential contribution to recurrent breast cancer risk. This review focuses on the urogenital consequences of estrogen deprivation therapy in breast cancer patients and provides practitioners with a simple guide of current and future strategies for managing these symptoms.

### A phase 2b, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, dose-ranging study of the neurokinin 3 receptor antagonist fezolinetant for vasomotor symptoms associated with menopause [^116bHTxn]. Menopause (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

Menopausal vasomotor symptoms (VMS) may result from altered thermoregulatory control in brain regions innervated by neurokinin 3 receptor-expressing neurons. This phase 2b study evaluated seven dosing regimens of fezolinetant, a selective neurokinin 3 receptor antagonist, as a nonhormone approach for the treatment of VMS.

Methods

Menopausal women aged > 40–65 years with moderate/severe VMS (≥ 50episodes/wk) were randomized (double-blind) to fezolinetant 15, 30, 60, 90mg BID or 30, 60, 120mg QD, or placebo for 12 weeks. Primary outcomes were reduction in moderate/severe VMS frequency and severity ([number of moderate VMS ×2] + [number of severe VMS ×3]/total daily moderate/severe VMS) at weeks 4 and 12. Response (≥ 50% reduction in moderate/severe VMS frequency) was a key secondary outcome.

Results

Of 352 treated participants, 287 completed the study. Fezolinetant reduced moderate/severe VMS frequency by -1.9 to -3.5/day at week 4 and -1.8 to -2.6/day at week 12 (all P < 0.05 vs placebo). Mean difference from placebo in VMS severity score was -0.4 to -1 at week 4 (all doses P < 0.05) and -0.2 to -0.6 at week 12 (P < 0.05 for 60 and 90mg BID and 60mg QD). Response (50% reduction) relative to placebo was achieved by 81.4% to 94.7% versus 58.5% of participants at end of treatment (all doses P < 0.05). Treatment-emergent adverse events were largely mild/moderate; no serious treatment-related treatment-emergent adverse events occurred.

Conclusions

Fezolinetant is a well-tolerated, effective nonhormone therapy that rapidly reduces moderate/severe menopausal VMS.: Video Summary:http://links.lww.com/MENO/A572; video script available at http://links.lww.com/MENO/A573.

### Surveillance and care of the gynecologic cancer survivor [^111kQze8]. Journal of Women's Health (2015). Low credibility.

Nonhormonal treatment of vasomotor symptoms

After BSO, both premenopausal and postmenopausal women experience an increase in VMS, which can negatively impact quality of life. The occurrence of VMS is attributed to decreased endogenous estrogen and androgens. It is paramount that physicians caring for gynecologic cancer survivors educate women on the potential risks and benefits of hormonal and nonhormonal treatments.

While nonhormonal therapies are often recommended, they are not as effective as HT in reducing VMS. Strategies such as paced respirations and avoidance of triggers for VMS such as caffeine, alcohol, and tobacco may be helpful. Studies regarding the effect of exercise on VMS report inconsistent results, although exercise is associated with improved quality of life, reduced stress, improvement in mood and somatic complaints, and less weight gain and muscle loss. It is also cost effective and has few side effects. Complementary and integrative therapies including black cohosh and phytoestrogens have not shown convincing evidence of efficacy for VMS. While a Cochrane review including 16 randomized, controlled trials concluded that there is insufficient evidence that acupuncture is effective for VMS, a recent meta-analysis of 12 trials suggested that acupuncture is associated with reduced VMS frequency and severity, as well as improvement in menopause-related symptoms and quality of life. Interestingly, sham acupuncture was shown to be equally effective. Selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors such as venlafaxine and paroxetine, respectively, are associated with modest VMS improvement but also have the potential for adverse sexual side effects. Low-dose paroxetine 7.5 mg was found to reduce VMS frequency and severity and is the first non-hormonal treatment for VMS approved by the FDA. Gabapentin is modestly effective for VMS in doses up to 900 mg daily.

### A phase 2b, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, dose-ranging study of the neurokinin 3 receptor antagonist fezolinetant for vasomotor symptoms associated with menopause [^114xmGFC]. Menopause (2020). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Objective:

Menopausal vasomotor symptoms (VMS) may result from altered thermoregulatory control in brain regions innervated by neurokinin 3 receptor-expressing neurons. This phase 2b study evaluated seven dosing regimens of fezolinetant, a selective neurokinin 3 receptor antagonist, as a nonhormone approach for the treatment of VMS.

Methods:

Menopausal women aged > 40–65 years with moderate/severe VMS (≥ 50 episodes/wk) were randomized (double-blind) to fezolinetant 15, 30, 60, 90 mg BID or 30, 60, 120 mg QD, or placebo for 12 weeks. Primary outcomes were reduction in moderate/severe VMS frequency and severity ([number of moderate VMS × 2] + [number of severe VMS × 3]/total daily moderate/severe VMS) at weeks 4 and 12. Response (≥ 50% reduction in moderate/severe VMS frequency) was a key secondary outcome.

Results:

Of 352 treated participants, 287 completed the study. Fezolinetant reduced moderate/severe VMS frequency by −1.9 to −3.5/day at week 4 and −1.8 to −2.6/day at week 12 (all P < 0.05 vs placebo). Mean difference from placebo in VMS severity score was −0.4 to −1 at week 4 (all doses P < 0.05) and −0.2 to −0.6 at week 12 (P < 0.05 for 60 and 90 mg BID and 60 mg QD). Response (50% reduction) relative to placebo was achieved by 81.4% to 94.7% versus 58.5% of participants at end of treatment (all doses P < 0.05). Treatment-emergent adverse events were largely mild/moderate; no serious treatment-related treatment-emergent adverse events occurred.

Conclusions:

Fezolinetant is a well-tolerated, effective nonhormone therapy that rapidly reduces moderate/severe menopausal VMS.

### Treatment of symptoms of the menopause: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^114FhMrT]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2015). Medium credibility.

Regarding medical management for menopause, more specifically with respect to management of vasomotor symptoms, hormonal therapy, ES 2015 guidelines recommend to consider initiating a combination of conjugated equine estrogens and bazedoxifene, where available and if not contraindicated, as an option for vasomotor symptoms in symptomatic postmenopausal patients with a uterus.

### Management of menopausal symptoms: a review [^116Dvofn]. JAMA (2023). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Menopause, due to loss of ovarian follicular activity without another pathological or physiological cause, typically occurs between the ages of 45 years and 56 years. During the menopausal transition, approximately 50% to 75% of women have hot flashes, night sweats, or both (vasomotor symptoms) and more than 50% have genitourinary symptoms (genitourinary syndrome of menopause [GSM]).

Observations

Vasomotor symptoms typically last more than 7 years and GSM is often chronic. Efficacious treatments for women with bothersome vasomotor symptoms or GSM symptoms include hormonal and nonhormonal options. Systemic estrogen alone or combined with a progestogen reduces the frequency of vasomotor symptoms by approximately 75%. Oral and transdermal estrogen have similar efficacy. Conjugated equine estrogens (CEE) with or without medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) were the only hormonal treatments for which clinical trials were designed to examine cardiovascular events, venous thromboembolism, and breast cancer risk. Compared with placebo, the increased risk of stroke and venous thromboembolism associated with CEE (with or without MPA) and breast cancer (with use of CEE plus MPA) is approximately 1 excess event/1000 person-years. Low-dose CEE plus bazedoxifene is not associated with increased risk of breast cancer (0.25%/year vs 0.23%/year with placebo). Bioidentical estrogens approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (with identical chemical structure to naturally produced estrogens, and often administered transdermally) also are available to treat vasomotor symptoms. For women who are not candidates for hormonal treatments, nonhormonal approaches such as citalopram, desvenlafaxine, escitalopram, gabapentin, paroxetine, and venlafaxine are available and are associated with a reduction in frequency of vasomotor symptoms by approximately 40% to 65%. Low-dose vaginal estrogen is associated with subjective improvement in GSM symptom severity by approximately 60% to 80%, with improvement in severity by 40% to 80% for vaginal prasterone, and with improvement in severity by 30% to 50% for oral ospemifene.

Conclusions and Relevance

During the menopausal transition, approximately 50% to 75% of women have vasomotor symptoms and GSM symptoms. Hormonal therapy with estrogen is the first-line therapy for bothersome vasomotor symptoms and GSM symptoms, but nonhormonal medications (such as paroxetine and venlafaxine) also can be effective. Hormone therapy is not indicated for the prevention of cardiovascular disease.

### Low-dose paroxetine (7.5 mg) improves sleep in women with vasomotor symptoms associated with menopause [^114C9NVA]. Menopause (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

Sleep disturbances are common among women in midlife; prevalence increases among perimenopausal/postmenopausal women with vasomotor symptoms. Paroxetine 7.5 mg is the only nonhormonal treatment that has been approved in the United States for moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms associated with menopause. In two pivotal phase 3 studies evaluating its efficacy and safety, improvements in sleep disturbances were also prospectively evaluated.

Methods

Postmenopausal women with moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms were randomly assigned to paroxetine 7.5 mg (n = 591) or placebo (n = 593) once daily for 12 weeks (both studies) or 24 weeks (24-wk study). Predefined assessments on weeks 4, 12, and 24 included number of nighttime awakenings attributed to vasomotor symptoms, sleep-onset latency, sleep duration, and sleep-related adverse events. The two studies' data for weeks 1 to 12 were pooled.

Results

At baseline, participants reported a mean of 3.6 awakenings/night attributed to vasomotor symptoms. Nighttime awakenings attributed to vasomotor symptoms were significantly reduced within 4 weeks of initiating paroxetine 7.5 mg treatment (39% reduction vs 28% for placebo; P = 0.0049), and reductions were sustained through 12 or 24 weeks of treatment. Paroxetine 7.5 mg treatment also significantly increased nighttime sleep duration (week 4, +31 vs +16 min for placebo; P = 0.0075), but no significant between-group differences in sleep-onset latency or sleep-related adverse events such as sedation were observed.

Conclusions

In postmenopausal women treated for menopausal vasomotor symptoms, paroxetine 7.5 mg significantly reduces the number of nighttime awakenings attributed to vasomotor symptoms and increases sleep duration without differentially affecting sleep-onset latency or sedation.

### The 2017 hormone therapy position statement of the North American Menopause Society [^111yvUiD]. Menopause (2018). Low credibility.

The 2017 Hormone Therapy Position Statement of The North American Menopause Society (NAMS) updates the 2012 Hormone Therapy Position Statement of The North American Menopause Society and identifies future research needs. An Advisory Panel of clinicians and researchers expert in the field of women's health and menopause was recruited by NAMS to review the 2012 Position Statement, evaluate new literature, assess the evidence, and reach consensus on recommendations, using the level of evidence to identify the strength of recommendations and the quality of the evidence. The Panel's recommendations were reviewed and approved by the NAMS Board of Trustees. Hormone therapy (HT) remains the most effective treatment for vasomotor symptoms (VMS) and the genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM) and has been shown to prevent bone loss and fracture. The risks of HT differ depending on type, dose, duration of use, route of administration, timing of initiation, and whether a progestogen is used. Treatment should be individualized to identify the most appropriate HT type, dose, formulation, route of administration, and duration of use, using the best available evidence to maximize benefits and minimize risks, with periodic reevaluation of the benefits and risks of continuing or discontinuing HT. For women aged younger than 60 years or who are within 10 years of menopause onset and have no contraindications, the benefit-risk ratio is most favorable for treatment of bothersome VMS and for those at elevated risk for bone loss or fracture. For women who initiate HT more than 10 or 20 years from menopause onset or are aged 60 years or older, the benefit-risk ratio appears less favorable because of the greater absolute risks of coronary heart disease, stroke, venous thromboembolism, and dementia. Longer durations of therapy should be for documented indications such as persistent VMS or bone loss, with shared decision making and periodic reevaluation. For bothersome GSM symptoms not relieved with over-the-counter therapies and without indications for use of systemic HT, low-dose vaginal estrogen therapy or other therapies are recommended.

### The 2023 nonhormone therapy position statement of the North American Menopause Society [^116rdLx9]. Menopause (2023). High credibility.

Nonhormone behavioral therapies for vasomotor symptoms (VMS) — key points indicate that cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) has been shown to reduce the bother and interference associated with VMS, and clinical hypnosis has been shown to reduce VMS frequency and severity; mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) interventions for the management of VMS are limited by sample size and lack of control groups and are not designed to control VMS; therefore, there are not enough data to recommend treatment, and paced breathing and relaxation techniques do not alleviate VMS and are not recommended.

### Systematic review and network meta-analysis comparing the efficacy of fezolinetant with hormone and nonhormone therapies for treatment of vasomotor symptoms due to menopause [^1158Za4k]. Menopause (2024). Medium credibility.

Vasomotor symptoms (VMS), consisting of hot flashes (also called hot flushes) and/or night sweats, affect a majority of women 40 to 64 years of age worldwide. Estrogen-based hormone therapy (HT) has historically been the standard of care for treatment of VMS due to menopause, particularly for women younger than 60 years or within 10 years of menopause. - It is, however, contraindicated in women with a history of breast cancer, high-grade advanced-stage endometrial cancer, coronary heart disease, stroke, myocardial infarction, or venous thromboembolism. In addition, many women who are eligible for HT elect not to use it because they believe that VMS will resolve on their own or because of concerns regarding the long-term safety of HT, such as the increased risk of breast cancer, stroke, and pulmonary embolism with combined estrogen plus progestogen therapy (EPT). -

Paroxetine 7.5 mg, a low-dose selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, is approved in the United States for treatment of VMS due to menopause. Other nonhormone therapies (non-HTs) including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, gabapentin, and clonidine are used off-label in clinical practice. Although head-to-head trials are lacking, these non-HTs are generally perceived to have more modest efficacy than HTs, as well as adverse effects that include drowsiness/somnolence, dizziness, nausea, dry mouth, sexual dysfunction, and (uncommonly) suicidal thoughts/behaviors.

Fezolinetant is a nonhormone neurokinin 3 receptor antagonist that was approved in 2023 by the US Food and Drug Administration for treatment of moderate to severe VMS due to menopause. In two phase 3 randomized, double-blind trials, SKYLIGHT-1 and SKYLIGHT-2, fezolinetant 45 mg daily significantly reduced the frequency and severity of moderate to severe VMS due to menopause compared with placebo at 4 and 12 weeks.

No head-to-head studies directly compared fezolinetant with available HT and non-HT options for VMS to help inform decision making and treatment selection. The objective of this systematic literature review (SLR) and Bayesian network meta-analysis (NMA) was to indirectly compare the efficacy of fezolinetant with that of HT and other non-HT regimens for reducing VMS in postmenopausal women.

### Management of vasomotor symptoms in cancer patients [^115WU89G]. The Oncologist (2025). Medium credibility.

Implications for Practice

Optimal management in cancer survivorship requires timely identification and management of symptoms. Hormone therapy is the gold standard treatment for VMS but is contraindicated in hormone-sensitive cancers. There is growing evidence demonstrating the efficacy of nonhormone options. While generally well tolerated by many, these agents can be associated with side effects that cancer patients may be particularly susceptible to. Encouragingly, emerging drug targets have enabled the development of novel pharmacologic treatments, thereby expanding treatment options for cancer patients with VMS. A comprehensive understanding of these therapeutic agents would enable health care providers to plan effective treatment strategies for cancer survivors experiencing VMS.

The authors reported that "after 8 weeks of treatment" electroacupuncture and combined modalities produced a "significant reduction of VMS per day" versus sham; however, "Existing evidence does not support the use of traditional acupuncture… (Level I; not recommended.)" and "The use of electroacupuncture, although more promising, still warrants further investigation.

SSRIs and SNRIs are associated with mild to moderate improvements in VMS, and gabapentin is associated with improvements in the frequency and severity of VMS. Because of significant AEs and no consistent studies showing greater benefit than placebo, clonidine is not recommended. Oxybutynin has been shown to reduce moderate to severe VMS, although in older adults, long-term use may be associated with cognitive decline. Given limited data, suvorexant is not recommended.

### Prevalence and impact of vasomotor symptoms due to menopause among women in Brazil, Canada, Mexico, and nordic Europe: a cross-sectional survey [^114pde8s]. Menopause (2023). Medium credibility.

Worldwide, on average, about 57% of women aged 40 to 64 years experience vasomotor symptoms (VMS) due to menopause.VMS are characterized by hot flashes (also called hot flushes) and/or night sweats. Reported VMS prevalence rates vary between regions in Asia, North and South America, Africa, and Australia, with estimates of 37% to 58% in Asia (16% in Japan), 18% to 70% in South America, 39% to 77% in Africa, 41% to 77% in North America (34% in the United States), 33% to 83% in Australia, and 40% to 97% in Europe. VMS often negatively affect quality of life (QoL) and interfere with daily activities and productivity at home and work. - They can also cause sleep disturbances (eg, nocturnal awakenings), which could further affect daily activities.,

VMS are the primary menopausal symptoms for which women seek treatment, and women with greater VMS severity have been shown to have an increased number of menopause-related physician visits. However, a recent electronic chart review showed that up to 40% of women did not receive a prescription treatment for their VMS after discussions with their healthcare practitioners (HCP). The proportion of women who use any treatment for their VMS is low, despite the data showing that HT is effective for VMS due to menopause. Nonhormone (non-HT) prescription therapies available at the time of the survey reported herein included selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRI), gabapentin/pregabalin, clonidine, and oxybutynin. - Many of these options do not have regulatory approval for VMS, which varies between countries. For example, paroxetine is approved for VMS in the United States, but it is not approved for VMS in Canada or Sweden, which are countries included in the current study. Modest efficacy of non-HT compared with HT, as well as concerns about safety and tolerability, may limit use of these agents. Thus, many women seek nonprescription herbal treatments and dietary supplements, despite a lack of evidence of their efficacy and safety.- In 2023, fezolinetant, a first-in-class neurokinin 3 receptor antagonist, was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for treatment of moderate to severe VMS due to menopause.

### Safety of fezolinetant for vasomotor symptoms associated with menopause: a randomized controlled trial [^111XZCW2]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2023). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

These data over 52 weeks in 1,830 randomized and treated participants experiencing vasomotor symptoms associated with menopause demonstrate the safety and tolerability of fezolinetant 30 mg and 45 mg and support its use over a 1-year period. No apparent safety signals for fezolinetant were observed over the study. Furthermore, the incidence of endometrial hyperplasia or malignancy in fezolinetant-treated participants, as assessed by blinded, centrally read endometrial biopsies, was within the prespecified limits and aligned with the FDA communication or draft guidance. In addition, there was no significant difference in change from baseline in endometrial thickness between fezolinetant- and placebo-treated participants and no effect on bone health (Appendix 5, available online at).

The treatment-emergent adverse events reported in the study were generally mild or moderate in severity, and the most common were headache and COVID-19, with fezolinetant consistent with placebo. Treatment-emergent adverse events leading to discontinuation were also similar between fezolinetant 30 mg and 45 mg.

Demonstrating endometrial safety is required for any treatment used to alleviate menopause symptoms according to the FDA draft guidance. The risk for endometrial hyperplasia or malignancy in individuals with a uterus is increased by unopposed estrogen exposure; hence, with hormonal therapy, progestogen is frequently used in combination for endometrial protection.

Fezolinetant is a nonhormonal treatment that acts through the neurokinin B pathway. Although the mechanism of action of fezolinetant is different from that of estrogen and estrogen plus progestin products, assessment with the same FDA clinical trial criteriaprovides important endometrial safety information on fezolinetant use. Given the risk and benefits associated with different treatment choices, some menopausal individuals may benefit from nonhormonal therapy that does not affect the endometrium.

Treatment-emergent adverse event reporting by the investigators also included events of endometrial hyperplasia, malignancy, or disordered proliferative endometrium, which are distinct from the events reported for the primary endpoints.

### Treatment satisfaction, unmet needs, and new treatment expectations for vasomotor symptoms due to menopause: women's and physicians' opinions [^117MSxWY]. Menopause (2024). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

For women, treatment satisfaction was similarly low across all treatment classes, while physicians were more satisfied with HT and less satisfied with non-HT and OTC treatments. Women were primarily concerned with lack of effectiveness and physicians were primarily concerned with long-term safety. Given the overall dissatisfaction with treatments among all participants, the majority of women and physicians would consider switching to a potential non-HT treatment that addresses their concerns. The results of this study highlight an unmet need among women and physicians for access to safer and more effective treatments for VMS.

Cochrane reviews found insufficient or poor evidence for exercise as treatment; pooled comparisons of exercise versus no exercise showed no effect on VMS frequency, and one review reported HT was far more effective than exercise. A pooled analysis of four MsFLASH trials (N = 1,005) evaluating several interventions found that women with bothersome VMS benefited most from estradiol, with CBT for insomnia or antidepressants helping specific subgroups; overall, exercise and yoga were not recommended as single interventions for VMS. A systematic review and meta-analysis of 12 randomized, controlled trials (N = 1,306) of yoga noted high risk of reporting and detection bias and significant heterogeneity in yoga styles, intensity, and frequency, limiting interpretability.

Stellate ganglion blockade for vasomotor symptoms (VMS) — evidence and guidance: A randomized, sham-controlled trial in women with natural or surgical menopause (N = 40) reported that over a 6-month follow-up stellate ganglion blockade reduced subjectively reported VMS, with a reduction (21%, P < .05) in physiologic VMS from baseline to 3 months; open-label studies reported reductions ranging from 45% to 90% over 6 weeks to several months. In women with breast cancer (N = 40), stellate ganglion blockade (10 mL 0.5% bupivacaine injected bilaterally) was compared with paroxetine 7.5 mg per day over a 6-week period, with both improving an index of frequency and severity without significant differences. Despite potential benefit, use should be carefully individualized, and it is stated as "not recommended" (Levels II-III; not recommended).

### Systematic review and network meta-analysis comparing the efficacy of fezolinetant with hormone and nonhormone therapies for treatment of vasomotor symptoms due to menopause [^113vvUYK]. Menopause (2024). Medium credibility.

A strength of this NMA is that it was based on evidence derived exclusively from phase 3 or 4 RCTs (ie, all level 1 evidence) with a generally low risk of bias. Included studies were identified via SLR; therefore, the current NMA presents an up-to-date, extensive analysis of available treatments that included study populations and efficacy outcomes comparable to those in the SKYLIGHT trials. Analysis of effects on VMS frequency included a wide range of HT and non-HT regimens at various doses. The use of a Bayesian NMA approach allowed for simultaneous pairwise comparisons and relative rankings of multiple interventions, maximizing the most recent comparative information.

This analysis also has limitations. Only direct comparisons in head-to-head randomized trials can avoid the potential for bias resulting from differences in unobserved baseline characteristics that are effect modifiers of the outcomes analyzed. Results of the VMS severity analysis should be interpreted with caution. To ensure that comparisons were valid, only studies that used the same calculation to determine severity scores as used in the fezolinetant SKYLIGHT trials were included in the NMA. As a result, tibolone 2.5 mg was the only HT regimen included in the severity analysis, so commonly used ET and EPT regimens were notably missing, as was paroxetine, the only non-HT regimen approved in the United States for treatment of VMS. Three randomized trials that compared gabapentin or venlafaxine with HT regimens did not meet the criteria for inclusion and/or did not have similar enough outcomes to permit analysis; these trials generally found the non-HT regimen to be as effective or nearly as effective as HT. -

Determination of treatment regimens to include in the primary analysis was driven by availability of relevant data and the goal of ensuring the formation of fully connected networks of evidence. As such, treatment options analyzed may not fully represent the standard of care in a particular country or may not have received regulatory approval and hence may not be available in clinical practice. On the other hand, some of the included regimens, particularly the non-HT ones, are commonly prescribed off-label and recommended in clinical practice guidelines for treatment of VMS due to menopause.

### Diagnosis and management of mood disorders during the menopausal transition [^1156iTu4]. The American Journal of Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Recent census data indicate that, in the United States, an increasing number of women — almost 1.5 million each year — are reaching menopause. The menopausal transition is marked by intense hormonal fluctuations, and may be accompanied by vasomotor complaints, sleep disturbances, changes in sexual function, and increased risk for osteoporosis and cardiovascular disease. In addition, there is evidence of increased risk for developing depression, even among women who never experienced depressive symptoms before. Thus depression during the perimenopause may have a substantial impact on personal, family, and professional spheres of life. A challenge to clinicians and health professionals lies in the identification of the most tolerable treatments to manage depression and improve quality of life in an aging population. Any treatment strategy should take into account not only the spectrum of side effects that may complicate treatment but also other menopause-related factors (e.g., vasomotor symptoms, psychosocial stressors) that may modulate risk for the development of mood disturbance. This article reviews the current literature on the prevalence and risk factors associated with depression during the menopausal transition. The benefits and risks of using hormonal and nonhormonal strategies for the management of depression and other menopause-related somatic symptoms are critically reviewed.

### Nonhormonal treatment of menopausal vasomotor symptoms… [^113rt2sX]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

10. 1001/jamainternmed.
2025. 0990. Vasomotor symptoms are the most widely recognized menopause symptoms in Western nations, with at least 75% of women reporting hot flashes or night sweats during or after the menopause transition. Many women struggle to choose between treatments, given lack of data on direct comparisons of different treatments, concerns about short-term adverse effects and longer-term treatment risks, and confusion about complementary or alternative remedies with unclear evidence of benefit. Estrogen therapy is the oldest US Food and Drug Administration –approved vasomotor symptom treatment and has the most robust evidence of efficacy, given an average 75% reduction in symptom frequency relative to placebo. 1 However, women with an intact uterus must take a progestogen with estrogen to prevent endometrial cancer.

Long-term use of estrogen plus progestogen increases the risk of breast cancer, as well as cardiovascular and venous thromboembolic events, particularly in women older than 60 years, 2 and even without progestogen therapy, long-term systemic estrogen increases stroke and thromboembolism in this group. Although the benefits of estrogen therapy in early-postmenopausal women with high symptom burden outweigh the risks, this article focuses on nonhormonal treatments 3–8 for women who are not candidates for or prefer to avoid hormone therapy.

2023. 15965. Vasomotor symptoms, which include night sweats and hot flashes, are the defining symptoms of the menopause transition and early postmenopause. Vasomotor symptoms result in diminished quality of life and affect work satisfaction, productivity, mood, and sleep. Prospective cohort studies show that vasomotor symptoms persist for 7 to 10 years in most individuals and even longer in at least 10%. 1 On average, people experience 4 to 5 vasomotor symptoms daily, but some may experience as many as 20. Vasomotor symptoms are one of the primary menopause-related problems for which patients seek medical treatment. 2 Customize your JAMA Network experience by selecting one or more topics from the list below.

### FDA approves novel drug to treat moderate to severe hot flashes caused by menopause… [^113YqgTZ]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

- For Immediate Release: Today, the U. S. Food and Drug Administration approved Veozah, an oral medication for the treatment of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms, or hot flashes, caused by menopause. Veozah is the first neurokinin 3 receptor antagonist approved by the FDA to treat moderate to severe hot flashes from menopause. It works by binding to and blocking the activities of the NK3 receptor, which plays a role in the brain's regulation of body temperature. "Hot flashes as a result of menopause can be a serious physical burden on women and impact their quality of life, " said Janet Maynard, M. D. M. H. S., director of the Office of Rare Diseases, Pediatrics, Urologic and Reproductive Medicine, in the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. "The introduction of a new molecule to treat moderate to severe menopausal hot flashes will provide an additional safe and effective treatment option for women".

Some women who experience hot flashes and have a history of vaginal bleeding, stroke, heart attack, blood clots or liver disease, cannot take hormone therapies. Veozah is not a hormone. It targets the neural activity which causes hot flashes during menopause. Patients taking Veozah should take one 45 milligram pill orally, once a day, with or without food. The pill should be taken at the same time each day. If a dose is missed, or not taken at the regular time, patients should take it as soon as possible and return to their regular schedule the following day. The effectiveness of Veozah to treat moderate to severe hot flashes was demonstrated in each of the first 12-week, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind portions of two phase 3 clinical trials. In both trials, after the first 12 weeks, the women on placebo were then re-randomized to Veozah for a 40-week extension study to evaluate safety. Each trial ran a total of 52 weeks.

The average age of the trial participants was 54 years old. The most common side effects of Veozah include abdominal pain, diarrhea, insomnia, back pain, hot flush and elevated hepatic transaminases. The FDA granted the Veozah application Priority Review designation. The approval of Veozah was granted to Astellas Pharma US, Inc. Inquiries

### ACOG releases clinical guidelines on management of… [^11196NoN]. AAFP (2014). Low credibility.

Key Points for Practice Vasomotor symptoms are best managed with systemic HT, although alternatives such as SSRIs, SNRIs, and clonidine have been shown to be effective. Vaginal symptoms are best treated with systemic or topical HT, but topical methods are preferable as they have fewer adverse effects. Recommendations BASED ON GOOD OR CONSISTENT EVIDENCE Systemic estrogen hormone therapy, with or without progestin, is the most effective therapy for menopause-related vasomotor symptoms, with evidence from multiple studies supporting the effectiveness. Oral and transdermal estrogen, alone or in combination with progestin, can be used, and have been shown to alleviate vasomotor symptoms.

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, clonidine, and gabapentin are effective nonhormonal medications for treating vasomotor symptoms, although paroxetine is the only nonhormonal medication approved by the U. S. Raloxifene and tamoxifen, which are FDA-approved for prevention of osteoporosis and breast cancer, are not effective for the treatment of menopause-related vaginal symptoms; evidence does not indicate a significant effect of either for treating vasomotor symptoms. Studies indicate that ospemifene, which is FDA-approved for treating moderate to severe dyspareunia in postmenopausal women, improves vaginal atrophy without stimulating the endometrium. Adverse effects of ospemifene include hot flashes, vaginal discharge, muscle spasms, genital discharge, and excessive sweating.

BASED ON LIMITED OR INCONSISTENT EVIDENCE Data do not support progestin-only medications, testosterone, compounded bioidentical hormones, phytoestrogens, herbal supplements, or lifestyle modifications for the treatment of vasomotor symptoms. Although there are limited data regarding lifestyle modifications, reasonable options include layering clothing, maintaining a lower ambient temperature, drinking cool liquids, and avoiding alcohol and caffeine. Nonestrogen water- or silicone-based vaginal lubricants and moisturizers may help with menopause-related vaginal symptoms and may be especially helpful in women wanting to avoid HT.

### Managing menopausal symptoms: common questions and answers… [^11162gVo]. AAFP (2023). Medium credibility.

What Nonhormonal Pharmacologic Treatments Are Effective for Vasomotor Symptoms. For patients with contraindications to hormone therapy and those who desire alternatives for vasomotor symptoms, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors are shown to be effective for managing hot flashes, but there are limited data from head-to-head comparison trials for drugs in both classes. 25, 26 Fezolinetant, a neurokinin 3 receptor antagonist, significantly reduces vasomotor symptoms when compared with placebo and received U. S. Food and Drug Administration approval for this indication in May 2023. 52–54 Other nonhormonal medication options include gabapentin, clonidine, and oxybutynin, but data supporting effectiveness are limited. 27–30 Table 4 lists nonhormonal treatments for vasomotor symptoms.

The neurokinin 3 receptor antagonist, fezolinetant, is the newest nonhormonal treatment option for vasomotor symptoms; it works by disrupting the thermoregulatory response to estrogen deficiency that is believed to cause hot flashes. What Nonpharmacologic Treatments Are Effective for Vasomotor Symptoms. Cognitive behavior therapy and clinical hypnosis are effective for short-term reduction of vasomotor symptoms and associated sleep disturbances. 9, 32–34 Black cohosh and isoflavones are shown to be effective compared with placebo but not significantly more than hormonal preparations, and they lack standard formulations. 35–37 Additional nonpharmacologic therapies include other dietary supplements, exercise, and acupuncture, but there are low-quality data available to support effectiveness. 9, 34, 38–41.

9 Regular exercise, yoga, biofeedback, and other mindfulness-based therapies are likely safe and may reduce stress associated with menopausal symptoms but are generally not effective for vasomotor symptoms. 34 The effectiveness and safety of the herbal supplement black cohosh and improving dyspareunia and sexual function scores.
