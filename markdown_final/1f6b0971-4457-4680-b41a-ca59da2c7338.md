## Question

What does the serum level of 15 mean in a TPO

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to interpret a thyroid peroxidase antibody (TPOAb) result of 15, including what units are implied, how to compare it with reference intervals, what it means clinically, and what to do next. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the assay units and why "15" almost certainly means 15 kIU/L. Then, I should verify typical reference intervals and where 15 falls relative to them. Next, I will interpret the clinical significance of a weakly positive TPOAb, including risk of progression and pregnancy implications. After that, I need to check confounders that can shift thresholds or alter interpretation, such as pregnancy, assay differences, and age/sex. Finally, I will outline practical next steps, including when to treat, when to monitor, and when no action is needed, and I will double-check guideline alignment before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the units, because misreading units is a common pitfall. TPOAb is typically reported in kilo-international units per liter (kIU/L), so a value of 15 almost always corresponds to 15 kIU/L, and I should explicitly state that to avoid ambiguity in interpretation and counseling [^notfound].

> Next, I should review reference intervals to contextualize "15". Wait, let me verify the most relevant data: a large outpatient study using an indirect method found mean upper reference limits of 15 kIU/L in females and 9 kIU/L in males, suggesting that 15 kIU/L sits right at the female upper limit and is above the male upper limit, which would classify it as borderline/weakly positive depending on sex and the local lab's cutoffs [^115Y6hJX]. I should also cross-check with a CLSI-aligned validation study that established a reference interval of about 3.3 to 13.8 kIU/L, which would make 15 kIU/L slightly above that lab-specific upper limit as well, reinforcing a weakly positive designation in many settings [^111qBvmT]. Hold on, I should verify manufacturer cutoffs too; some platforms list TPOAb < 60 IU/mL as "negative", which is equivalent to < 60 kIU/L, so 15 kIU/L would be well below such a high manufacturer threshold, underscoring that interpretation must be assay- and lab-specific rather than relying on generic cutoffs alone [^116TwQkX].

> Now, I will interpret the clinical meaning. A TPOAb of about 15 kIU/L represents low-level thyroid autoimmunity. It is not diagnostic of overt autoimmune thyroid disease by itself, but it signals increased risk of future hypothyroidism, particularly if TSH is already high-normal or mildly elevated, with observational data suggesting progression risk around 4.3% per year when TPOAb is positive versus 2.6% per year when negative in subclinical hypothyroidism cohorts, though this is a risk modifier rather than a mandate to treat immediately [^111RAXV8] [^1162aCfA]. Let me consider pregnancy-specific implications: TPOAb positivity in euthyroid women is associated with higher risk of gestational hypothyroidism and postpartum thyroiditis, and TPOAb titers tend to fall during pregnancy, so a value of 15 kIU/L in early pregnancy may decline further as gestation advances, which can affect test timing and interpretation if reassessed later [^11322XTY] [^113ysmUG] [^114PCgR7].

> Hold on, I should verify confounders that can shift thresholds or alter interpretation. Assay-to-assay variability is substantial; different immunoassays have different upper limits, so a result of 15 kIU/L may be "positive" in one lab and "negative" in another, which is why results must be interpreted against the specific laboratory's reference interval and, ideally, verified locally per CLSI principles [^111qBvmT]. I need to ensure I account for sex and age; females have higher upper limits than males, and while some population data suggest minimal age-related change, other cohorts show rising prevalence with age, so a value of 15 kIU/L may carry different implications in a 30-year-old woman versus a 70-year-old man [^115Y6hJX] [^111RAXV8]. But wait, what if the patient is pregnant or recently pregnant? TPOAb titers commonly decline by about 60% over gestation, so a first-trimester value of 15 kIU/L may be closer to 6 kIU/L by term, which could appear "negative" on repeat testing even though autoimmunity persists, complicating serial interpretation [^114PCgR7] [^113ysmUG].

> Next, I should review what to do clinically. If the patient is euthyroid with TSH and free T4 normal, I should confirm persistence with a repeat TSH and TPOAb in 6–12 months rather than acting on a single data point, because low-level positivity can fluctuate and day-to-day biological variation is notable. Persistent positivity strengthens inference of autoimmune thyroiditis and informs longitudinal risk [^114bqgrE]. If TSH is high-normal or mildly elevated, I should double-check for subclinical hypothyroidism and consider treatment decisions that incorporate symptoms, cardiovascular risk, and antibody status, recognizing that guidelines support a lower threshold to treat when TPOAb is positive, though this remains individualized and evidence is mixed for hard outcomes [^1168sTdk] [^1162aCfA]. In pregnancy or preconception planning, I should confirm that TSH is monitored more closely if TPOAb is positive, with many guidelines suggesting surveillance about every 4 weeks through mid-gestation, and consider treatment if TSH exceeds pregnancy-specific thresholds in the presence of autoimmunity, balancing potential benefits and evidence limitations [^113uC6tY] [^114SqyRa] [^112K8EdX].

> I should double-check special contexts. In patients with thyroid nodules or goiter, measuring TPOAb helps identify autoimmune thyroiditis as the underlying process, which can refine differential diagnosis and management expectations, so a value of 15 kIU/L would support that consideration if clinical or ultrasound features are compatible [^113dKW8X] [^1161o8QZ]. In differentiated thyroid cancer follow-up, TPOAb is not used for tumor surveillance, but TgAb can interfere with thyroglobulin assays; knowing TPOAb status does not directly alter cancer monitoring, but it situates the patient within autoimmune thyroid disease biology, which is contextually useful [^117BXGEW].

> Let me reconsider the bottom line to ensure internal consistency. A TPOAb of 15 kIU/L is a weakly positive result that sits at or just above many lab-specific upper limits, indicating low-level thyroid autoimmunity without establishing overt disease. It modestly increases the risk of future hypothyroidism, has particular implications in pregnancy due to gestational titer decline and risk of gestational thyroid dysfunction, and should be interpreted against the specific assay's reference interval and the clinical context, with repeat testing to confirm persistence before making management decisions [^115Y6hJX] [^111qBvmT] [^111RAXV8] [^11322XTY] [^114PCgR7].

---

A serum TPO antibody level of 15 IU/mL is **borderline or mildly positive** and indicates low-level thyroid autoimmunity [^111mnQ72]. It is not diagnostic of autoimmune thyroid disease on its own, but it **increases the risk of future hypothyroidism**, especially if TSH is elevated or symptoms develop [^1162aCfA]. No immediate treatment is needed; **repeat TSH and TPOAb in 6–12 months** [^116XK1nC], and monitor annually if TSH is normal. In pregnancy, consider closer monitoring because TPOAb positivity raises the risk of gestational hypothyroidism and postpartum thyroiditis [^11322XTY] [^114PCgR7].

---

## Clinical significance of TPO antibody level 15 IU/mL

- **Reference ranges**: Most labs consider TPOAb < 35 IU/mL as negative or within normal limits, though assay-specific cutoffs vary [^116mASkY].
- **Interpretation**: 15 IU/mL is a low-level positive result, indicating minimal thyroid autoimmunity [^111qBvmT].
- **Clinical correlation**: TPOAb positivity alone does not diagnose autoimmune thyroid disease; results must be interpreted with TSH, free T4, and clinical context [^116XK1nC].

---

## Clinical implications and risks

- **Progression to hypothyroidism**: TPOAb positivity increases the risk of developing hypothyroidism, particularly subclinical or overt, especially with elevated TSH [^1162aCfA].
- **Pregnancy considerations**: TPOAb-positive women have higher risks of gestational hypothyroidism and postpartum thyroiditis; monitor TSH more closely during pregnancy [^11322XTY] [^114PCgR7].
- **Autoimmune thyroid disease**: TPOAb is present in Hashimoto's thyroiditis and Graves' disease, but a low level alone is not diagnostic [^116g6fhT] [^111RAXV8].

---

## Recommended clinical actions

- **Confirmatory testing**: Repeat TSH, free T4, and TPOAb in 6–12 months to assess stability and progression [^notfound].
- **Monitoring**: If TSH is normal, monitor annually; if TSH is elevated, follow subclinical hypothyroidism guidelines [^1168sTdk].
- **Pregnancy management**: If pregnant or planning pregnancy, monitor TSH more frequently due to increased risk of thyroid dysfunction [^11322XTY] [^114SqyRa].
- **Lifestyle factors**: Address modifiable risks (iodine intake, smoking, stress) that may influence thyroid autoimmunity [^116g6fhT].

## Interpretation of TPO antibody levels

| **TPOAb level (IU/mL)** | **Interpretation** | **Clinical significance** | **Recommended action** |
|-|-|-|-|
| < 35 | Negative or normal | No significant autoimmunity | Routine monitoring |
| 15 | Mildly positive | Low-level autoimmunity | - Repeat TSH/TPOAb in 6–12 months <br/> - Annual monitoring if TSH normal |
| 35–100 | Moderately positive | Increased risk of thyroid dysfunction | - Monitor TSH every 6–12 months <br/> - Consider treatment if TSH elevated |
| > 100 | Strongly positive | High risk of autoimmune thyroid disease | - Close monitoring <br/> - Consider treatment if TSH elevated |

---

A TPOAb of 15 IU/mL is a low-level positive result indicating minimal autoimmunity; **no immediate treatment is needed**, but periodic monitoring is prudent, especially if TSH rises or pregnancy is planned [^111qBvmT].

Laboratory measurements

In our laboratory, the serum concentrations of thyroid hormones and thyroid-related antibodies including thyroid peroxidase antibodies (TPOAb) and thyroglobulin antibody (TGAb) were detected by a supersensitive electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (Siemens healthcare diagnostics K.K.), with reference ranges for: TSH 0.55–4.78 μIU/mL, free thyroxine (FT 4) 11.45–23.17 pmol/L, and free triiodothyronine (FT 3) 3.50–6.50 pmol/L, TPOAb < 60 IU/mL and TGAb < 15 IU/mL. TRAb was measured using electrochemiluminescence immunoassay by a Cobas e601 (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany). The measuring range for TRAb was 0.30–40 IU/L and the cut-off value provided by the manufacturer was 1.75 IU/L. According to the manufacturer's quality control, the coefficient of variation (CV) was calculated according to the formula CV = SD/Mean × 100%. The intra-assay CV was 2.29% and the inter-assay CV was 2.65%.

Based on bridge immunoassay technology, automated assay of serum TSI was performed using Siemens IMMULITE 2000 analyzer. It employed a pair of recombinant human TSH receptor constructs in a bridging format which included both the capture and the signal receptor. The captured receptor was formed by replacing the amino acid fragment of the human TSH receptor aa 261–370 with the amino acid fragment of rat luteinizing hormone (LH) or the gonadotropin receptor aa 261–329. The captured receptor was fixed on a microtiter plate and bound to one antibody arm of TSI. The signal receptor, which consists of TSHR (aa 21–261) and secretory alkaline phosphatase (SEAP), binds to the other antibody arm of TSI. The amount of TSI bound was determined by the intensity of enhanced chemiluminescence development by the reaction of SEAP with luminescent substrate. This assay detected TSI with an intra-assay CV of 3.46% and an inter-assay CV of 2.69%, and a CV of 4.34% at a higher TSI concentration (18.9 IU/L) and 4.17% at a lower concentration (0.87 IU/L), respectively. The measuring range for TSI was 0.10–40 IU/L and the cut-off value suggested by the manufacturer was 0.55 IU/L.

### Selenium supplementation significantly reduces thyroid autoantibody levels in patients with chronic autoimmune thyroiditis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112rcnW7]. Thyroid (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Selenium supplementation may decrease circulating thyroid autoantibodies in patients with chronic autoimmune thyroiditis (AIT), but the available trials are heterogenous. This study expands and critically reappraises the knowledge on this topic.

Methods

A literature search identified 3366 records. Controlled trials in adults (≥ 18 years of age) with AIT, comparing selenium with or without levothyroxine (LT4), versus placebo and/or LT4, were eligible. Assessed outcomes were serum thyroid peroxidase (TPOAb) and thyroglobulin (TgAb) autoantibody levels, and immunomodulatory effects. After screening and full-text assessment, 16 controlled trials were included in the systematic review. Random-effects meta-analyses in weighted mean difference (WMD) were performed for 3, 6, and 12 months of supplementation in two different populations: one receiving LT4 therapy and one newly diagnosed and LT4-untreated. Heterogeneity was estimated using I², and quality of evidence was assessed per outcome, using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) guidelines.

Results

In LT4-treated populations, the selenium group had significantly lower TPOAb levels after three months (seven studies: WMD = -271 [confidence interval (CI) -366 to -175]; p < 0.0001; I² = 45.4%), which was consistent at six months (three studies) and 12 months (one study). TgAb decreased at 12 months, but not at three or six months. In LT4-untreated populations, the selenium group showed a decrease in TPOAb levels after three months (three studies: WMD = -512 [CI -626 to -398]; p < 0.0001, I² = 0.0%), but not after 6 or 12 months. TgAb decreased at 3 months, but not at 6 or 12 months. Quality of evidence was generally assessed as low. Study participants receiving selenium had a significantly higher risk than controls of reporting adverse effects (p = 0.036).

Conclusions

Selenium supplementation reduced serum TPOAb levels after 3, 6, and 12 months in an LT4-treated AIT population, and after three months in an untreated AIT population. Whether these effects correlate with clinically relevant measures remains to be demonstrated.

Autoimmune thyroid disease (AITD) and antibody testing — AITDs are estimated to be 5–10 times more common in women than men, and in the Whickham survey 5% of women and 1% of men had both positive antibody tests and a serum TSH value > 6; many patients with chronic autoimmune thyroiditis are biochemically euthyroid, but approximately 75% have elevated anti-thyroid antibody titers; in NHANES, thyroglobulin antibodies (TgAb) were positive in 10.4% and anti-thyroid peroxidase antibodies (TPOAb) in 11.3%, were more common in women and increased with age, and only positive TPOAb tests were significantly associated with hypothyroidism; elevated TPOAb in subclinical hypothyroidism predicts progression to overt hypothyroidism at 4.3% per year versus 2.6% per year without elevated TPOAb titers; several professional societies and many clinical endocrinologists endorse measurement of TPOAbs in those with subclinical hypothyroidism, and in patients with a diffuse, firm goiter, TPOAb should be measured to identify autoimmune thyroiditis.

Thyroid autoimmunity and prevalence considerations informing screening: Overt hypothyroidism is prevalent in 0.3%–0.5% of pregnant women and is asymptomatic in about 70% of patients. Anti-TPO positivity occurs in up to 17% of reproductive age women and identifies women at risk for developing hypothyroidism during gestation (20%) and postpartum thyroiditis (30–50%). Screening programs described elsewhere often have initial evaluation between 10 and 15 weeks of gestation, and no data support an anti-TPO–based universal testing algorithm at present.

### Screening for thyroid dysfunction: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^114bqgrE]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) screening performance and variability — test characteristics and limitations are outlined: specificity is "about 92%", most laboratories "define an abnormal TSH test result by using the upper and lower limits of the 95% reference interval for a particular assay (generally about 0.4 to 4.5 mIU/L)", and among older adults "12% of persons aged 80 years or older with no evidence of thyroid disease have been found to have TSH levels greater than 4.5 mIU/L". Day-to-day mean values can vary "by as much as 50%", with "up to 40% variation" in same-time serial measurements; consequently, "All of this confirms the importance of not relying on a single TSH value to establish a diagnosis of thyroid dysfunction" and "Serial TSH measurements are an essential step in establishing that a thyroid disorder is real and persistent", while "TSH secretion is highly sensitive to factors other than thyroid disorders".

### Why measure thyroglobulin autoantibodies rather than thyroid peroxidase autoantibodies? [^1171SszC]. Thyroid (2004). Low credibility.

Autoantibodies to thyroglobulin (TgAb) and thyroid peroxidase (TPOAb) are of immunoglobulin G (IgG) class and have high affinities for their respective autoantigens. Both autoantibodies are markers of thyroid autoimmunity and they can be measured by a variety of assays. From the clinical perspective, TgAb are less prevalent than TPOAb and less useful than TPOAb for prediction of thyroid dysfunction. Moreover, TgAb interfere with Tg measurements to monitor metastases in thyroid cancer. However, increasing evidence suggests that these TgAb provide a surrogate for Tg. In terms of disease pathogenesis, Tg has been suggested to play a role in Graves' ophthalmopathy. Pending further studies, TgAb epitopes could distinguish between individuals who are euthyroid or who have clinical disease. A final, intriguing reason for measuring and characterizing TgAb is the interest these autoantibodies have rekindled in their autoantigen. It is conceivable that Tg polymorphisms, combined with the explosive mix of iodine, TPO and H2O2 necessary for thyroid hormone synthesis, inadvertently provide the trigger for the autoimmune thyroid response.

### Evaluation of risk-factor-based screening for thyroid peroxidase antibody positivity in pregnancy [^112NtnSd]. Clinical Endocrinology (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine whether risk-factor-based screening for thyroid dysfunction in pregnancy performs well for detecting thyroid peroxidase antibodies (TPOAb), a marker for autoimmune thyroid disease.

Study Design

We prospectively evaluated pregnant women for thyroid dysfunction using The Endocrine Society's eleven screening questions. Serum was analysed for TPOAb.

Result

We enrolled 546 women. TPOAb positivity was higher in women with a personal (odds ratio (OR) = 8·0; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1·7–37·4; P = 0·02) or family history of thyroid disease (OR = 2·7; 95% CI = 1·3–5·7; P = 0·02). There was no association between the number of positive responses and TPOAb positivity (P = 0·41). Risk-factor-based screening missed 18 women (33%) with TPOAb.

Conclusion

One-third of women with TPOAb were missed by the case-finding method. A personal or family history of thyroid disease was most strongly associated with TPOAb positivity.

### Verification and determination of the thyroid peroxidase antibody reference interval: insight into the CLSI guideline [^111qBvmT]. Laboratory Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To verify the upper reference limit and define the population-based reference interval (RI) for thyroid peroxidase antibody, according to Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines.

Material and Methods

We subjected serum samples from 146 subjects to thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and TPO Ab analysis for verification and determination of RI. We verified an upper reference limit for thyroid peroxidase antibody (TPO Ab) and established an RI according to National Academy of Clinical Biochemistry (NACB) and CLSI guidelines.

Results

The manufacturer's suggested upper reference limit was not verified for use as a functional reference value. Rather, on defining the RI of TPO Ab by means of a full-scale study, we found a higher upper reference limit (13.8 vs 12.0). We calculated lower and upper reference limits of 3.3 and 13.8, with 90% confidence intervals (CIs) of 2.8 to 3.5 and 13.6 to 14.8, respectively.

Conclusion

RIs provided by assay manufacturers are general data and may not always be appropriate for different locations and patient demographics. Verification of an RI is necessary before use in a given patient population.

### The reference interval of thyroid-stimulating hormone in Hong Kong Chinese [^1124A6Qr]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2011). Low credibility.

Aim

The upper reference limit of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) is critical for defining patients with subclinical hypothyroidism, a condition which carries a higher risk of progression to overt hypothyroidism and adverse cardiovascular events. Yet, there is a lack of consensus on its absolute value, and data in non-pregnant adult Chinese are lacking.

Methods

Apparently healthy and drug-free local adult Chinese were recruited by completing health questionnaires. Their serum samples were tested for TSH, free thyroxine (FT4), thyroglobulin antibody and thyroid peroxidase antibody levels. After excluding subjects with thyroid antibodies, the TSH level was log-transformed, and the reference limits were defined as mean ± 1.96SD. The 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles of FT4 were also calculated.

Results

Serum samples from 212 subjects were used in this study. 51 subjects were seropositive to thyroglobulin antibody, 31 were seropositive to thyroid peroxidase antibody, and 27 were seropositive to both. The reference intervals after excluding subjects seropositive to thyroid antibodies were: TSH: 0.68–3.70 mIU/l; FT4: 13.5–21.3 pmol/l (male) and 12.6–19.7 pmol/l (female). Including subjects with thyroid antibodies only minimally changed the reference intervals of these hormones.

Conclusion

The authors have set up the reference interval of TSH for the local population, and their findings also suggest that the importance of excluding subjects with thyroid antibodies in the reference population should not be overemphasised. Moreover, the international authorities should consider recommending percentile-equivalent action limits instead of an absolute cut-off on TSH for categorisation of different types of thyroid dysfunction.

### Changes in serum adhesion molecules, chemokines, cytokines, and tissue remodeling factors in euthyroid women without thyroid antibodies who are at risk for autoimmune thyroid disease: a hypothesis on the early phases of the endocrine autoimmune reaction [^117B6XeR]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2013). Low credibility.

Background

The target glands in spontaneous animal models of endocrine autoimmune disease show, prior to the autoimmune reaction, growth and connective tissue abnormalities, whereas the autoimmune reaction is initiated by an early accumulation of macrophages and dendritic cells in the target glands.

Aim

The aim of the study was to test the hypothesis that serum factors related to these growth and connective tissue abnormalities and the early accumulation of immune cells, ie, tissue growth/remodeling factors, adhesion molecules, chemokines, and pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, are related to thyroid peroxidase autoantibodies (TPO-Abs) seroconversion in subjects at risk to develop autoimmune thyroid disease (AITD).

Design

A controlled study on 64 TPO-Ab-negative euthyroid female relatives with at least 1 first- or second-degree relative with documented autoimmune hyper- or hypothyroidism, 32 of whom did and 32 who did not seroconvert to TPO-Ab positivity in 5-year follow-up. The relatives were compared with 32 healthy controls. In all subjects we measured serum levels of chemokine (C-C motif) ligand (CCL)-2, CCL3, CCL4, soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule, soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1, thrombospondin-1, vascular endothelial growth factor-A, angiopoietin 1 receptor-2, metalloproteinase-13, platelet-derived growth factor-BB, fibronectin, IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, IL-10, and growth differentiation factor-15 by multiplex (cytometric bead array) or a single commercial ELISA.

Results

Both seroconverting and nonseroconverting family members showed an up-regulation of fibronectin and a down-regulation of platelet-derived growth factor-BB and the adhesion and migration factors CCL2, CCL4, soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, angiopoietin 1 receptor-2, and metalloproteinase-13. The seroconverters differed from the nonseroconverters by an up-regulation of the proinflammatory compounds Il-1β, IL-6, and CCL3.

Conclusion

This study shows that euthyroid females within AITD families show a characteristic pattern of abnormalities in serum levels of tissue remodeling factors, growth factors, chemokines, (vascular) adhesion molecules, and cytokines prior to the occurrence of TPO-Abs in serum. The results provide proof of principle that preseroconversion stages and seroconversion to AITD might be predicted using serum analytes related to growth/connective tissue abnormalities and migration/accumulation abnormalities of macrophages and dendritic cells.

### 2017 guidelines of the American Thyroid Association for the diagnosis and management of thyroid disease during pregnancy and the postpartum [^114fN71m]. Thyroid (2017). Medium credibility.

Thyroid disease during pregnancy — universal screening recommendations: There is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against universal screening for abnormal thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) concentrations in early pregnancy, and there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against universal screening for abnormal TSH concentrations preconception (with the exception of women planning assisted reproduction or those known to have thyroid peroxidase antibody [TPOAb] positivity). Universal screening to detect low free thyroxine (FT4) concentrations in pregnant women is not recommended. The corresponding evidence labels are "No recommendation, insufficient evidence" for the first two statements and "Weak recommendation, moderate-quality evidence" for FT4 screening.

### Reference intervals of serum thyroid function tests in a previously iodine-deficient area [^115Zsr3X]. Thyroid (2005). Low credibility.

Aim

We undertook the present study to establish reference data for serum thyroid function tests in a previously iodine-deficient area.

Methods

Data from 4298 individuals, 20–79 years of age were available for the present analysis. Thyroid function (thyrotropin [TSH], free triiodothyronine [FT(3)], and free thyroxine [FT(4)]) and serum autoantibodies to thyroperoxidase (anti-TPOAb) were evaluated from blood samples. Thyroid structure and size were measured by ultrasound.

Results

A reference population was selected comprising 1488 persons (825 men) by excluding subjects with known thyroid diseases, and with yet unknown thyroid disorders such as goitre, inhomogeneous thyroid pattern, nodules, hypoechogenicity and anti-TPOAb seropositivity. Reference intervals for serum TSH, FT(3), and FT(4) were 0.25–2.12 mIU/L, 3.8–7.0 pmol/L, and 8.3–18.9 pmol/L, respectively. Reference serum TSH levels were not comparable to the reference values that were recently established for the U.S. population and most reference values slightly differed from the reference values provided by the manufacturers.

Conclusions

The reference ranges of thyroid function tests in this formerly iodine-deficient region are distinct from the reference ranges that were established in areas with iodine sufficiency. Creating a reference population in the present setting should include thyroid ultrasound in order to exclude yet undiagnosed thyroid disorders.

### Antithyroid peroxidase antibodies in patients with high normal range thyroid stimulating hormone [^117Vamuy]. Family Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Hypothyroidism is linked to heart disease and decreased quality of life. Since screening guidelines for the general population are controversial, and physicians use clinical judgment in deciding to order thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), high-normal levels of TSH pose a dilemma. This study's objective was to compare rates of positive anti-thyroid peroxidase antibodies (antiTPO) tests in persons with high-normal versus low-normal TSH levels.

Methods

Physicians at a publicly funded family medicine outpatient clinic used a standard clinical set of criteria to identify patients in need of TSH testing. Patients with non-thyroid diseases or conditions that affect TSH were excluded. A total of 143 patients over 18 years of age presented with symptoms necessitating TSH testing and had levels that fell between 0.36 and 5.49 IU/ml. They were allocated into two groups: 100 patients with TSH levels between 0.36–2.49 IU/ml (low-normal TSH) and 43 patients with TSH levels between 2.5–5.49 IU/ml (high-normal TSH), and they all had measurements of antiTPO levels. Primary outcomes were rates of antiTPO and demographics comparisons between the two groups.

Results

The prevalence of the antiTPO antibody in the high-normal group was 18.6% versus 3% in the low-normal range TSH. The antiTPO prevalence was higher in females than in males and had a racial predominance in Hispanics compared to African Americans; however, these differences were not statistically significant.

Conclusions

AntiTPO measurement may be appropriate for patients with high-normal TSH to help distinguish those at risk of developing true hypothyroidism.

### Screening and subsequent management for thyroid dysfunction pre-pregnancy and during pregnancy for improving maternal and infant health [^117HLKRJ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Thyroid dysfunction pre-pregnancy and during pregnancy (both hyper- and hypothyroidism) is associated with increased risk of adverse outcomes for mothers and infants in the short- and long-term. Managing the thyroid dysfunction (e.g. thyroxine for hypothyroidism, or antithyroid medication for hyperthyroidism) may improve outcomes. The best method of screening to identify and subsequently manage thyroid dysfunction pre-pregnancy and during pregnancy is unknown.

Objectives

To assess the effects of different screening methods (and subsequent management) for thyroid dysfunction pre-pregnancy and during pregnancy on maternal and infant outcomes.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (14 July 2015) and reference lists of retrieved studies.

Selection Criteria

Randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials, comparing any screening method (e.g. tool, program, guideline/protocol) for detecting thyroid dysfunction (including hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, and/or thyroid autoimmunity) pre-pregnancy or during pregnancy with no screening, or alternative screening methods.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed eligibility of studies, extracted and checked data accuracy, and assessed the risk of bias of included studies.

Main Results

We included two randomised controlled trials (involving 26,408 women) - these trials were considered to be at low risk of bias. Universal screening (screening all women) versus case finding (screening only those at perceived increased risk) in pregnancy for thyroid dysfunctionOne trial (4562 women) compared universal screening with case finding for thyroid dysfunction. Before 11 weeks' gestation, women in the universal screening group, and 'high-risk' women in the case finding group had their sera tested for TSH (thyroid stimulating hormone), fT4 (free thyroxine) and TPO-Ab (thyroid peroxidase antibody); women with hypothyroidism (TSH > 2.5 mIU/litre) received levothyroxine; women with hyperthyroidism (undetectable TSH and elevated fT4) received antithyroid medication. In regards to this review's primary outcomes, compared with the case finding group, more women in the universal screening group were diagnosed with hypothyroidism (risk ratio (RR) 3.15, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.91 to 5.20; 4562 women; GRADE: high quality evidence), with a trend towards more women being diagnosed with hyperthyroidism (RR 4.50, 95% CI 0.97 to 20.82; 4562 women; P = 0.05; GRADE: moderate quality evidence). No clear differences were seen in the risks of pre-eclampsia (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.18; 4516 women; GRADE: moderate quality evidence), or preterm birth (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.24; 4516 women; GRADE: high quality evidence) between groups. This trial did not report on neurosensory disability for the infant as a child. Considering this review's secondary outcomes, more women in the universal screening group received pharmacological treatment for thyroid dysfunction (RR 3.15, 95% CI 1.91 to 5.20; 4562 women). No clear differences between groups were observed for miscarriage (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.19; 4516 women; GRADE: moderate quality evidence), fetal and neonatal death (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.42 to 2.02; 4516 infants; GRADE: moderate quality evidence), or other secondary outcomes: pregnancy-induced hypertension, gestational diabetes, congestive heart failure, thyroid storm, mode of birth (caesarean section), preterm labour, placental abruption, respiratory distress syndrome, low birthweight, neonatal intensive care unit admission, or other congenital malformations. The trial did not report on a number of outcomes including adverse effects associated with the intervention. Universal screening versus no screening in pregnancy for hypothyroidismOne trial (21,846 women) compared universal screening with no screening for hypothyroidism. Before 15 + 6 weeks' gestation, women in the universal screening group had their sera tested; women who screened 'positive' (TSH > 97.5th percentile, fT4 < 2.5th percentile, or both) received levothyroxine. Considering primary review outcomes, compared with the no screening group, more women in the universal screening screened 'positive' for hypothyroidism (RR 998.18, 95% CI 62.36 to 15,978.48; 21,839 women; GRADE: high quality evidence). No data were provided for the outcome pre-eclampsia, and for preterm birth, the trial reported rates of 5.6% and 7.9% for the screening and no screening groups respectively (it was unclear if these percentages related to the entire cohort or women who screened positive). No clear difference was seen for neurosensory disability for the infant as a child (three-year follow-up IQ score < 85) (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.22; 794 infants; GRADE: moderate quality evidence). More women in the universal screening group received pharmacological treatment for thyroid dysfunction (RR 1102.90, 95% CI 69.07 to 17,610.46; 1050 women); 10% had their dose lowered because of low TSH, high fT4 or minor side effects. No clear differences were observed for other secondary outcomes, including developmental delay/intellectual impairment at three years. Most of our secondary outcomes, including miscarriage, fetal or neonatal death were not reported.

Authors' Conclusions

Based on the existing evidence, though universal screening for thyroid dysfunction in pregnancy increases the number of women diagnosed with hypothyroidism who can be subsequently treated, it does not clearly impact (benefit or harm) maternal and infant outcomes. While universal screening versus case finding for thyroid dysfunction increased diagnosis and subsequent treatment, we found no clear differences for the primary outcomes: pre-eclampsia or preterm birth. No clear differences were seen for secondary outcomes, including miscarriage and fetal or neonatal death; data were lacking for the primary outcome: neurosensory disability for the infant as a child, and for many secondary outcomes. Though universal screening versus no screening for hypothyroidism similarly increased diagnosis and subsequent treatment, no clear difference was seen for the primary outcome: neurosensory disability for the infant as a child (IQ < 85 at three years); data were lacking for the other primary outcomes: pre-eclampsia and preterm birth, and for the majority of secondary outcomes. For outcomes assessed using the GRADE approach the evidence was considered to be moderate or high quality, with any downgrading of the evidence based on the presence of wide confidence intervals crossing the line of no effect. More evidence is needed to assess the benefits or harms of different screening methods for thyroid dysfunction in pregnancy, on maternal, infant and child health outcomes. Future trials should assess impacts on use of health services and costs, and be adequately powered to evaluate the effects on short- and long-term outcomes.

### Serum thyroglobulin levels after fine-needle aspiration of thyroid nodules [^114jd72u]. Endocrine Practice (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To investigate whether a minor insult to the thyroid gland attributable to fine-needle aspiration (FNA) or external thyroid palpation can cause a release of serum thyroglobulin (Tg) into the circulation.

Methods

We determined serum Tg levels before and at 60 minutes and 15 days after FNA in 25 patients with thyroid nodules. Results were compared with those obtained in 25 patients with thyroid nodules, in whom serum Tg concentrations were determined before and 60 minutes after palpation of the thyroid, and in 15 healthy subjects without thyroid disease, who had no thyroid palpation and no FNA, from whom 2 blood specimens were obtained 60 minutes apart. All participants had normal results of thyroid function tests and no detectable antithyroglobulin or thyroid peroxidase antibodies.

Results

After FNA, 22 of 25 patients had significant elevation of serum Tg concentrations. The Tg levels returned to baseline values 15 days after FNA. In 4 of the 25 patients with thyroid nodules who had palpation of the thyroid, a significant increase in serum Tg levels was elicited. None of the 15 healthy subjects with normal thyroid glands (and with no FNA or thyroid palpation) had significant Tg elevations.

Conclusion

FNA causes a significant increase in serum Tg concentrations, which may persist for 15 days. Therefore, Tg assay should not be scheduled prematurely after FNA.

### Assessment of thyroid function in patients with alkaptonuria [^116mASkY]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

The primary end point of the study was to analyze the prevalence of thyroid dysfunction in patients with alkaptonuria and compare the prevalence with a standard US adult population used as a control sample. The secondary end point was to study the association of thyroid dysfunction with age, sex, and thyroid peroxidase (TPO) antibodies, as well as serum tyrosine and urine HGA levels. Demographic, clinical, and biochemical data were obtained from medical records and patient interviews. Detailed information regarding potential confounding variables was obtained, including comorbidities, use of medications potentially affecting thyroid function (eg, amiodarone, estrogens, and glucocorticoids), and use of medications potentially affecting measurements of thyroid hormones (eg, biotin).

Serum thyrotropin and free thyroxine levels were measured by immunoassay and were repeated in each patient a median of 3 (interquartile range [IQR], 2–22) times. The results of thyroid function tests were verified by liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry at least once during follow-up. Overt hypothyroidism was defined as a thyrotropin level above the reference range (between 2010 and 2014: 0.40–4.00 mIU/L and between 2014 and 2018: 0.27–4.2 mIU/L) and a free thyroxine level below the reference range (between 2010 and 2014: 0.9–1.5 ng/dL and between 2014 and 2018: 0.9–1.7 ng/dL [to convert to picomoles per liter, multiply by 12.871]) on 2 tests or normalization of thyrotropin levels on weight-based levothyroxine replacement therapy. Subclinical hypothyroidism was defined as a thyrotropin level above the reference range with free thyroxine levels within the reference range on 2 tests. Overt hyperthyroidism was defined as decreased/suppressed thyrotropin levels with elevated free thyroxine levels, and subclinical hyperthyroidism was defined as thyrotropin levels below the lower limit of the reference range with free thyroxine levels within the reference range measured on at least 2 occasions. Thyroid peroxidase antibodies were measured by immunoassay (reference range, < 10–35 IU/mL). The mean serum tyrosine concentration (reference range, 0.56–1.63 mg/dL [to convert to micromoles per liter, multiply by 55.19]) was measured by liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry, repeated a median of 3 (range, 1–24) times in each patient. The mean urine HGA concentration (reference range, < 11 mmol/mol creatinine [Cr]) was measured by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry in a 24-hour urine collection, repeated a median of 3 (IQR, 1–13) times in each patient. Seventeen of 125 patients (13.6%) with alkaptonuria were receiving nitisinone therapy between 2005 and 2009.

Laboratory evaluation of thyroid nodules — The high sensitivity of the thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) assay makes it the most useful laboratory test in the initial evaluation of thyroid nodules, and third-generation TSH chemiluminometric assays, with detection limits of about 0.01 μU/mL, should be used; if the serum TSH level is within the reference range (unless suspicion of central hypothyroidism), the measurement of free thyroid hormones adds no further relevant information. To limit unnecessary laboratory testing, the following strategy should be followed for most patients: serum TSH within normal limits — no further testing (unless suspicion of central hypothyroidism); increased serum TSH — test FT4 and TPOAb to evaluate for hypothyroidism; decreased serum TSH — test FT4 and total or FT3 to evaluate for hyperthyroidism.

### Definition of reference limits for autoantibodies to thyroid peroxidase and thyroglobulin in a large population of outpatients using an indirect method based on current data [^115Y6hJX]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Context

The reference limits for thyroid antibodies are generally made by measuring thyroid peroxidase and thyroglobulin antibody values in a group of healthy subjects (direct method), as proposed by the National Academy of Clinical Biochemistry.

Objective

To define the upper reference limits of thyroid peroxidase and thyroglobulin, by using an indirect method to analyze data from a large number of outpatients that were stored in the information system of a general hospital laboratory.

Design

Thyroid peroxidase and thyroglobulin values from 21 492 patients, who had undergone antithyroid antibody measurements, were retrieved from the laboratory information system; the upper reference limits (in the top 97.5 percentile) were calculated using the indirect Kairisto method, after exclusion of outliers.

Results

The mean upper reference limits for females and males were 15 kIU/L and 9 kIU/L for thyroid peroxidase, and 21 kIU/L and 19 kIU/L for thyroglobulin, respectively. The upper limits showed minimal or no differences in the different age classes in either females or males.

Conclusions

Using a vast population of patients, we demonstrated that the upper limits for thyroid antibodies are much lower than the values obtained with classic, direct methods and that they do not vary in relation to age and sex.

### To reflect human autoimmune thyroiditis, thyroid peroxidase (not thyroglobulin) antibodies should be measured in female (not sex-independent) NOD.H2mice [^1167PJQx]. Clinical and Experimental Immunology (2019). Medium credibility.

NOD.H2 h4 mice are the most commonly used model for human autoimmune thyroiditis. Because thyroid autoimmunity develops slowly (over months), NOD.H2 h4 mice are usually exposed to excess dietary iodide to accelerate and amplify the process. However, unlike the female bias in human thyroid autoimmunity, autoantibodies to thyroglobulin (TgAb) are reported to be similar in male and female NOD.H2 h4. We sought evidence for sexual dimorphism in other parameters in this strain maintained on regular or iodized water. Without iodide, TgAb levels are higher in males than in females, the reverse of human disease. In humans, autoantibodies to thyroid peroxidase (TPOAb) are a better marker of disease than TgAb. In NOD.H2 h4 mice TPOAb develop more slowly than TgAb, being detectable at 6 months of age versus 4 months for the latter. Remarkably, unlike TgAb, TPOAb levels are higher in female than male NOD.H2 h4 mice on both regular and iodized water. As previously observed, serum T4 levels are similar in both sexes. However, thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels are significantly higher in males than females with or without iodide exposure. TSH levels correlate with TgAb levels in male NOD.H2 h4 mice, suggesting a possible role for TSH in TgAb development. However, there is no correlation between TSH and TPOAb levels, the latter more important than TgAb in human disease. In conclusion, if the goal of an animal model is to closely reflect human disease, TPOAb rather than TgAb should be measured in older female NOD.H2 h4 mice, an approach requiring patience and the use of mouse TPO protein.

### A longitudinal study of thyroid autoantibodies in pregnancy: the importance of test timing [^113ysmUG]. Clinical Endocrinology (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

Thyroid peroxidase antibodies (TPOAb) and thyroglobulin antibodies (TGAb) are frequently measured to investigate thyroid dysfunction in pregnancy. Despite the recognized fall of these autoantibodies in pregnancy, there is limited guidance on the timing of such testing. We assessed optimal test timing of TPOAb/TGAb for the detection of Hashimoto's thyroiditis and post-partum thyroid dysfunction (PPTD).

Design

Prospective longitudinal study with recruitment in Trimester 1.

Patients

Healthy women ≤ 13 weeks' gestation from Mercy Hospital for Women, a tertiary obstetric hospital in Melbourne.

Measurements

Serum TPOAb, TGAb, TSH and fT4 were measured at Trimester 1 (T1), Trimester 2(T2), Trimester 3(T3) and postpartum (PP) in each participant. Post-partum thyroid dysfunction (PPTD) was defined if TSH deviated from the assay's nonpregnant reference interval. Longitudinal random-effect logistic regression was used to investigate the association between time and positive/negative thyroid autoantibody status.

Results

Samples from 140 women at T1 (12·0: 10·3–13·0) (median: IQR weeks' gestation); 95 at T2 (24·3: 23·0–25·9), 79 at T3 (35·9: 34·8–36·7) and 83 at PP (12·4: 10·8–14·6 weeks post-partum) were attained. At T1, 13 (9%) and 15 (11%) women had positive TPOAb and TGAb, respectively. The odds of having a positive TPOAb were 96% lower at T2 [OR = 0·04 (95% CI: 0·02–0·8; P = 0·03)] and 97% lower at T3 [OR = 0·03 (95% CI: 0·001–0·6; P = 0·02)] than at T1. Similarly, the odds of having a positive TGAb were 99·4% lower [OR = 0·006 (95% CI: 0–0·3; P = 0·01)] at T2, and 99·5% lower [OR = 0·005 (95% CI: 0–0·4; P = 0·02)] at T3 than at T1. The ROC analysis diagnostic ORs for a positive TPOAb and/or TGAb to predict PPTD were 7·8 (95% CI: 2·2–27·6), 1·2 (95% CI: 0–8·9), 2·0 (95% CI: 0–16·8), and 12·2 (95% CI: 3·3–44·9) at T1, T2, T3 and post-partum, respectively.

Conclusions

A significant proportion of pregnant women lose their thyroid autoantibody positivity after T1. The gestation-dependent loss of TPOAb/TGAb positivity and reduction in diagnostic accuracy for predicting PPTD limits the value of testing at T2 and T3.

### Subclinical hypothyroidism in childhood, treatment or only follow-up? [^116qSWKu]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Subclinical hypothyroidism (SH) is defined as serum levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) above the upper limit with normal concentrations of free T4 (fT4). Its management remains challenging. The aim of the study was to evaluate clinical and laboratory findings as well as the clinical course of children with SH followed in a third level hospital. Sixty-five patients aged between 2 and 18years old were retrospectively studied.

Methods

The patients were followed for a median period of 9months (range 6months to 24months). Those who normalized TSH levels were discharged (Group 1). If TSH persisted mildly elevated (5–10μUI/mL) with normal fT4 and negative TPOAb/TgAb, they were classified as Group 2 and followed semi-annually without treatment. Those patients whose TSH raised ≥ 10μUI/mL or who maintained TSH 5–10μUI/mL and positive TPOAb/TgAb were considered suitable for thyroxin therapy (Group 3, G3).

Results

In 89% of our patients, TSH concentrations spontaneously reverted to normality or remained stable without treatment (Groups 1 and 2), whereas less than 11% progressed to clinical hypothyroidism (Group 3). Baseline TSH was significantly lower in group 1 than in group 3. In group 3 the prevalence of female sex (71%) was higher and TPO antibodies were present in 85% of patients. The risk of developing overt hypothyroidism in patients with positive anti-thyroid antibodies respect to those who normalized TSH was 45 (95%CI 6.5–312.5).

Conclusion

Baseline TSH, female sex and the presence of thyroid autoimmunity were the best predictors of the evolution to SH over time.

Hashimoto disease is a chronic autoimmune thyroiditis. Despite adequate hormone substitution, some patients have persistent symptoms that may be the result of immunologic pathophysiology.

Objective

To determine whether thyroidectomy improves symptoms in patients with Hashimoto thyroiditis who still have symptoms despite having normal thyroid gland function while receiving medical therapy.

Design

Randomized trial. (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02319538).

Setting

Secondary care hospital in Norway.

Patients

150 patients aged 18 to 79 years with persistent Hashimoto-related symptoms despite euthyroid status while receiving hormone replacement therapy and with serum antithyroid peroxidase (anti-TPO) antibody titers greater than 1000 IU/mL.

Intervention

Total thyroidectomy or medical management with hormone substitution to secure euthyroid status in both groups.

Measurements

The primary outcome was general health score on the Short Form-36 Health Survey (SF-36) at 18 months. Secondary outcomes were adverse effects of surgery, the other 7 SF-36 subscores, fatigue questionnaire scores, and serum anti-TPO antibody titers at 6, 12, and 18 months.

Results

During follow-up, only the surgical group demonstrated improvement: Mean general health score increased from 38 to 64 points, for a between-group difference of 29 points (95% CI, 22 to 35 points) at 18 months. Fatigue score decreased from 23 to 14 points, for a between-group difference of 9.3 points (CI, 7.4 to 11.2 points). Chronic fatigue frequency decreased from 82% to 35%, for a between-group difference of 39 percentage points (CI, 23 to 53 percentage points). Median serum anti-TPO antibody titers decreased from 2232 to 152 IU/mL, for a between-group difference of 1148 IU/mL (CI, 1080 to 1304 IU/mL). In multivariable regression analyses, the adjusted treatment effects remained similar to the unadjusted effects.

Limitation

Results are applicable only to a subgroup of patients with Hashimoto disease, and follow-up was limited to 18 months.

Conclusion

Total thyroidectomy improved health-related quality of life and fatigue, whereas medical therapy did not. This improvement, along with concomitant elimination of serum anti-TPO antibodies, may elucidate disease mechanisms.

Primary Funding Source

### Thyroid autoantibodies [^111mnQ72]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2023). Medium credibility.

Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) receptor antibody (TSH-R-Ab or TRAb) testing plays a pivotal role in arriving at the aetiological diagnosis in patients with thyrotoxicosis. A positive test establishes the diagnosis of Graves' disease (GD) while a negative result in conjunction with imaging studies supports other possible aetiologies. In patients with GD, TRAb levels at diagnosis and at the time of withdrawal of antithyroid drugs can identify patients who are unlikely to achieve remission and guide clinical management decisions. We provide an algorithm that incorporates TRAb in the decision-making process for the management of thyrotoxicosis. The utility of TRAb in predicting the risk of fetal and neonatal thyroid dysfunction is established and widely accepted in guidelines. TRAb may also help in the diagnosis of Graves' orbitopathy, especially in euthyroid or hypothyroid patients and its role in guiding its management is evolving as a useful adjunct to the clinical parameters used in making therapeutic decisions. Anti-thyroid peroxidase antibodies (TPOAb) and anti-thyroglobulin antibodies (TgAb) indicate thyroid autoimmunity. The most common use of TPOAb is to identify patients at a higher risk of progression to treatment-requiring hypothyroidism. They also aid the diagnosis of immune thyroiditis and Hashimoto's encephalopathy. Thyroglobulin measurement is used to help guide differentiated thyroid cancer treatment. TgAb is used as an accompanying test with thyroglobulin measurement as its presence can interfere with the thyroglobulin assay. A negative TgAb result reduces the likelihood of, but does not exclude, interference with thyroglobulin assay.

Autoantibodies and thyroglobulin (Tg) — diagnostic scope in thyroid nodules: Thyroid peroxidase antibody (TPOAb) should be measured in patients with abnormal levels of serum TSH, while thyroglobulin antibody testing should be limited to those with ultrasonography and clinical findings suggestive of chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis and with normal TPOAb levels. Thyrotropin receptor antibody (TRAb) determination should be performed in patients with hyperthyroidism, noting that 17% of patients in iodine-deficient areas with scintigraphically toxic multinodular goiter test positive for TRAb. Assessment of serum Tg is not recommended in the diagnosis of thyroid nodules, and its use is not recommended in routine clinical practice in the evaluation of thyroid nodules.

### Thyroid antibodies and levothyroxine effects in subclinical hypothyroidism: a pooled analysis of two randomized controlled trials [^114zDFsD]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Autoimmunity is a common etiology of SHypo characterized clinically by high levels of anti–thyroid peroxidase antibodies (anti‐TPO). Anti‐TPO induces cell‐mediated cytotoxicity and its presence is associated with the development of thyroid dysfunction. Adults with SHypo and positive anti‐TPO are more prone to progress to overt hypothyroidism in studies with long‐term follow‐up of up to 20 years (4.3%/year for positive antibodies vs. 2.6%/year for negative antibodies). For these patients, the indication for treatment remains controversial. Two guidelines suggest considering treatment in the presence of positive antibodies to prevent progression to overt hypothyroidism, irrespective of TSH levels, as do some international experts, while another guideline does not mention antibody status as an indication for treatment. Despite controversial recommendations, physicians often use anti‐TPO testing to decide whether to initiate treatment. In a survey of American Thyroid Association members and primary care providers, approximately 10%–20% more physicians would initiate therapy in SHypo if antibodies were positive than if antibodies were negative. Little data on the frequency of anti‐TPO measurements at the population level exist, but a population‐based study of 5552 outpatients found a relatively high proportion of 3%/year of participants with at least one anti‐TPO antibody test. Data are very limited on the impact of positive antibodies, as no large RCTs have demonstrated that antibody status influences the effectiveness of levothyroxine on clinical outcomes in adults with SHypo. Previous studies had design limitations such as including only young patients or having small sample sizes (N = 40–100). Therefore, in this ancillary analysis of two large RCTs (TRUST and IEMO80+), we aimed to evaluate whether antibody status influences the effectiveness of levothyroxine on clinical outcomes in older adults with SHypo.

### 2017 guidelines of the American Thyroid Association for the diagnosis and management of thyroid disease during pregnancy and the postpartum [^114X5NRz]. Thyroid (2017). Medium credibility.

Pregnancy-related thyroid physiology and autoimmunity — maternal changes, lab interpretation, and antibody prevalence — includes thyroid enlargement, increased hormone production and iodine needs, hCG-related TSH suppression, and frequent thyroid autoantibodies. During pregnancy, the thyroid gland increases in size by 10% to 20% in iodine replete countries but by 20% to 40% in areas of iodine deficiency, and production of thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) increases by nearly 50%, with a separate 50% increase in the daily iodine requirement; accurate assessment remains difficult and interpretation of laboratory testing differs from the nonpregnant patient. Placental chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) stimulates thyroid hormone secretion, often decreasing maternal thyrotropin (TSH) concentrations. Autoimmunity is common, with up to 18% of all pregnant women thyroid peroxidase antibody (TPOAb) or thyroglobulin antibody (TgAb) positive, and TPOAb positivity adversely modulates the impact of maternal thyroid status on the pregnancy and the developing fetus and separately increases the risk of thyroid dysfunction following delivery and during the postpartum period.

### Low levels of serum vitamin D3 are associated with autoimmune thyroid disease in pre-menopausal women [^112dY4y1]. Thyroid (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Low serum vitamin D levels have been associated with several autoimmune diseases, but their association with thyroid autoimmunity is unclear. We evaluated the association of serum vitamin D levels with the prevalence of autoimmune thyroid disease (AITD).

Methods

Our cross-sectional study included subjects who underwent routine health checkups, which included assays of serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D3 [25(OH)D3] and anti-thyroid peroxidase antibody (TPO-Ab), as well as thyroid ultrasonography (US) between 2008 and 2012 at the Asan Medical Center. We defined AITD according to the levels of TPO-Ab and US findings.

Results

A total of 6685 subjects (58% male; 42% female) were enrolled for this study. Overall prevalence of TPO-Ab positivity and both TPO-Ab/US positivity were 10.1% (6.3% male; 15.3% female) and 5.4% (2.3% male; 9.7% female) respectively. In female subjects, mean serum 25(OH)D3 levels were significantly lower in the TPO-Ab(+) (22.0 vs. 23.5 ng/mL, p = 0.030) and TPO-Ab(+)/US(+) groups (21.6 vs. 23.4 ng/mL, p = 0.027) compared with the control group, respectively. According to the levels of serum 25(OH)D3, the prevalence of TPO-Ab positivity (21.2%, 15.5%, and 12.6% in deficient, insufficient, and sufficient group, respectively; p = 0.001) and both TPO-Ab and US positivity (14.7%, 9.9%, and 7.1% in deficient, insufficient, and sufficient group, respectively; p < 0.001) decreased in female subjects. Interestingly, this pattern was significant only in pre-menopausal women (p = 0.003 and p < 0.001; respectively), but not in postmenopausal women. Multivariate analysis indicated that the adjusted odds ratios (OR) for AITD among those in the 25(OH)D3-deficient [TPO-Ab(+): OR 1.95, p = 0.001; TPO-Ab(+)/US(+): OR 2.36, p < 0.001] and -insufficient groups [TPO-Ab(+): OR 1.31, p = 0.043; TPO-Ab(+)/US(+): OR 1.50, p = 0.017] were significantly increased when compared with the sufficient group.

Conclusions

The levels of serum vitamin D were significantly lower in pre-menopausal women with AITD. Vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency were significantly associated with AITD in pre-menopausal women.

### Adjusted association between type 2 immunity and low risk thyroid nodules: a retrospective cohort study [^115bvieD]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2022). Medium credibility.

Comparison of thyroid-function and serum tumor markers of subjects with and without thyroid nodules

Thyroid function test results showed that the positive rates of antithyroglobulin antibody (TgAb, 4.6% vs 2.3%, P < 0.05) and antithyroid peroxidase antibody (TPOAb, 4.4% vs 2.8%, P < 0.05) were higher in those with than in those without thyroid nodules. While there were no statistically significant differences between the two groups regarding the serum levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), free T3 and free T4 (Table 5). Besides, we didn't detect any difference for serum tumor markers compromised alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), neuron-specific enolase (NSE), carbohydrate antigen 19–9 (CA19–9), carbohydrate antigen 12–5 (CA12–5) and carbohydrate antigen 15–3 (CA15–3) in between subjects with and without thyroid nodules (Table 6).

### Point-of-care assays for autoantibodies to thyroid peroxidase and to thyroglobulin [^112xsnU2]. Thyroid (2005). Low credibility.

Point-of-care (POC) assays for autoantibodies to thyroid peroxidase (TPOAb) and to thyroglobulin (TgAb) are described. Both assays are based on the ability of autoantibodies in test samples (whole blood, plasma, or sera) to inhibit the binding of monoclonal antibodies to TPO or to Tg. The assays require no special equipment and give results in 10 minutes. Analysis of samples from healthy blood donors (n = 80), patients with autoimmune thyroid disease (n = 97) and nonthyroid autoimmune diseases (n = 20) showed that results with the POC tests compared well to those obtained by agglutination assay and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The reference immunoprecipitation assays (IPA) based on 125I-labeled TPO or Tg were more sensitive than the POC tests particularly in the case of TgAb measurements. However, no samples were found positive by POC test and negative by IPA emphasizing the high specificity of the POC assays. Our results suggest that POC testing for TPOAb and TgAb with assays such as those we describe could be useful in certain situations. These include prediction of postpartum thyroiditis and the development of interferon-alpha-related thyroid disease.

American Thyroid Association (ATA) 2017 — Subclinical hypothyroidism in pregnancy is examined across multiple cohort studies that are largely nonselected, population-based, with subclinical hypothyroidism often defined by TSH ≥ 2.5 mIU/L; evaluated outcomes include GDM and perinatal outcomes and cesarean section rate for fetal distress. Methods and covariate handling varied (for example, no multivariate analysis in some studies). Reporting of thyroid peroxidase antibody (TPOAb) status was inconsistent, with notes such as no data on TPOAb status and analyses limited to TPOAb-negative women.

Immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI)-induced thyroid dysfunction — screening and follow-up emphasize that "the majority of patients in whom thyroid dysfunction develops after ICI therapy are asymptomatic", and "all patients should be tested (TSH and free T4) at the baseline prior to therapy". Ongoing surveillance is advised with "frequent monitoring with each cycle or every 4 to 6 weeks from the start of ICI therapy or as needed… should allow for the detection of evolving thyroid disease". Baseline antibodies are not definitive because "Evidence for the measurement of the levels of thyroid peroxidase and thyroglobulin antibodies at the baseline to predict future thyroid dysfunction is still emerging", though "additional laboratory investigations for TSH receptor antibodies… and thyroglobulin may help to distinguish the diagnoses", and "Additional imaging… may have a role in select cases". Management notes that "ICI therapy need not be interrupted or discontinued in cases of thyroid-related side effects", while "Patients with overt hypothyroidism (a low level of free T4 and persistently elevated level of TSH of more than twice the upper limit of the normal range) will require thyroid hormone replacement".

Laboratory examinations

Biochemical markers were measured in the clinical laboratory of Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital, which carried out laboratory tests according to ISO15189 international quality standard. Approximate 5-ml of venous blood was drawn from each subject in the morning, after a 12-h overnight fast. After collection, the blood sample was immediately sent to the clinical laboratory for centrifugation and testing through the transmission system. The remaining serum was stored at 2–8 °C for two weeks before discarding, unless there was any question about the test results. Fasting plasma glucose (FPG), total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) concentrations were measured on enzymatic auto-analyzer (Kyowa Medex Co. Ltd. Tokyo, Japan) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Serum levels of FT3, FT4, TSH, thyroglobulin antibody (TgAb), and thyroid peroxidase antibody (TPOAb) were measured by electrochemiluminescence (Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland) following the standard methods with strict quality control. The intraassay coefficients of variation (CV) for serum FT3, FT4, TSH, TgAb, and TPOAb were 15–22%, 14–29%, 15–86%, 24–56%, and 22–63%, respectively. The inter-assay CV values were 17–28%, 27–66%, 18–87%, 21–69%, and 52–82%, respectively.

### "Hypothyroidism screening during first trimester of pregnancy" [^112274Dy]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Subclinical hypothyroidism is defined as an elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone level with a normal thyroxin level without signs or symptoms of hypothyroidism. Although it is well accepted that overt hypothyroidism has a deleterious impact on pregnancy, recent studies indicate that subclinical hypothyroidism may affect maternal and fetal health. Studies suggest an association between miscarriage and preterm delivery in euthyroid women positive for anti-peroxidase antibodies and/or anti-thyroglobulin antibodies. A proposal of a new set-point to diagnose SCH was recently published. The aim of this research was to determine the optimal thyroid-stimulating hormone cut-off point to screen for subclinical hypothyroidism in the first trimester of gestation in a population of our clinical area and to determine the diagnostic value of this screening test for detecting anti-thyroid peroxidase antibodies.

Methods

This cross-sectional study determines the cutoff point for SCH screening and evaluates its usefulness to detect TPO Ab using the Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) curve. Prevalence of SCH was calculated using as cut-off 2.5 mIU/L, 4 mIU/L, and our TSH 97.5th percentile. The ability to detect positive anti-thyroglobulin antibodies (TG Ab) and anti-thyroid peroxidase antibodies (TPO Ab) in patients with levels of TSH > 97.5th percentile was determined by ROC curves.

Results

The mean, range and standard deviation of TSH was 2.15 ± 1.34 mIU/L (range 0.03–8.82); FT4 was 1.18 ± 0.13 ng/dL (range 0.94–1.3); TG Ab was 89.87 ± 413.56 IU/mL (range 0.10–4000); and TPO Ab was 21.61 ± 46.27 IU/mL(range 0.10–412.4). The ROC. analysis of the ability of the TSH level to predict the presence of positive TPO Ab found an AUC of 0.563.

Conclusion

In our population, the TSH cutoff value for gestational SCH screening is 4.7 mIU/L. Using the SEGO recommended 2.5 mIU/L TSH cut-off point, the prevalence of SCH is 37%. Applying the ATA 2017 recommended cutoff point of 4 mIU/L, the prevalence of SCH is 9.6%. Finally, when the cut-off of 4.7 mIU/L (our 97.5th centile) was used, the SCH prevalence is 5%. TSH levels in the first trimester of pregnancy are not useful to detect TPO Ab.

Differentiated thyroid cancer — preoperative serum thyroglobulin (Tg) and thyroglobulin antibody (TgAb) testing — Routine preoperative measurement of serum Tg or TgAb levels is not recommended. (Conditional recommendation, Low certainty evidence) In a prospective, observational cohort, preoperative serum Tg was not a significant predictor of malignancy, and in a retrospective series of 131 patients Tg levels did not significantly differ between benign and malignant nodules; in another retrospective review of 422 patients with thyroid cancer, preoperative Tg correlated with gland size and T category but not with metastasis and was of low utility for preoperative evaluation. A separate retrospective study reported linear associations between preoperative Tg and disease extent with thresholds of 13.15 ng/mL for ipsilateral lateral lymph node metastasis, 30.05 ng/mL for contralateral lateral lymph node metastasis, and 62.9 for distant metastasis. Regarding TgAb, in a cross‑sectional analysis of 170 patients from a registry including 11 North American centers enrolled between 1987 and 2011, TgAb status was not significantly associated with stage and was not associated with disease‑free or overall survival.

### Subclinical hypothyroidism in the infertile female population: a guideline [^113deGjG]. Fertility and Sterility (2024). High credibility.

Subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH) in the first trimester of pregnancy — screening practices, outcomes, and cost-effectiveness are summarized. Most professional organizations recommend against universal routine screening and recommend a risk-based approach, and the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology recommends testing of thyroid function "in women with a personal or family history of thyroid disease, type 1 diabetes mellitus, or clinical suspicion of thyroid disease" and does not recommend universal screening or SCH treatment. A retrospective study on 756 women enrolled at ≤ 12 weeks gestation demonstrated that participants with identified SCH had a significantly higher rate of spontaneous abortion (15.48% vs. 8.86%, P = 0.03) but no increased rates of obstetric or neonatal outcomes. Another retrospective cohort reported a higher rate of fetal death among the 2.2% of 9,403 women with TSH levels ≥ 6 mIU/L compared with those with TSH levels < 6 mIU/L (0.90%: OR 4.4; 95% CI, 1.9–9.5), although this did not represent true SCH. Decision-analytic models concluded that routine TSH screening resulted in cost savings and gained quality-adjusted life years compared with no routine screening, and a combined first-trimester TSH plus antithyroid peroxidase antibodies approach found universal screening more cost-effective than high-risk screening and no screening. In a cohort of 537 iodine-supplemented women, treating TPOAb+ women with 50 µg of levothyroxine when TSH exceeded 1 mIU/L was associated with a lower spontaneous abortion rate versus no treatment (0 vs. 16.0%; p = 0.022). A high-quality randomized controlled trial (RCT) reported no benefit of antenatal thyroid screening regarding childhood cognitive function, and another high-quality RCT randomly assigned 4,562 women to immediate universal testing versus case-finding for FT4, TSH, and TPOAbs with no significant differences in adverse outcomes between groups.

### Differential evolution of thyroid peroxidase and thyrotropin receptor antibodies in Graves' disease: thyroid peroxidase antibody activity reverts to pretreatment level after carbimazole withdrawal [^11127Z9C]. Thyroid (2006). Low credibility.

In this study, we compared the evolution of thyroid peroxidase antibody (TPOAb) and thyroid-stimulating antibody (TSAb) activities before, during, and after treatment of Graves' disease (GD) with carbimazole. TPOAb and TSAb were measured in sera from 75 patients with GD, during an 18-month block-replace regimen and after drug withdrawal (12, 24, and 36 months). At diagnosis, TPOAb were present in 85% of the patients versus 99% for TSAb. During the treatment, TPOAb values and prevalence significantly decreased, as observed with TSAb. After drug withdrawal, TPOAb levels increased once again to reach the pretreatment values, whereas TSAb remained unchanged. TPOAb values and prevalence at drug withdrawal were not significantly different between patients who remained euthyroid and those who had a relapse of hyperthyroidism. In contrast, TSAb values and prevalence were higher at drug withdrawal in relapse patients. In conclusion, TPOAb and TSAb changes are similar during GD treatment by carbimazole but diverge after drug withdrawal. TPOAb might reflect autoimmune perturbations independently of the clinical status and of the thyroid-stimulating activity.

Background

Thyroid gland abnormalities have afflicted a high number of populations, globally. Precise diagnosis mandates accurate testing for free triiodothyronine (fT3), free thyroxine (fT4) and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) commonly known as thyroid function tests. Any abnormality in thyroid function test warrants the clinicians to evaluate for thyroid antibodies titer. Hashimoto's thyroiditis and Graves' disease, two of the most prevalent autoimmune diseases that affect particular organs, are examples of autoimmune thyroid disorders. The pathogenesis of the illness has been linked to several predisposing genetic loci, including CTLA4, HLA, and IL2RA, as well as some environmental variables, including radioiodine therapy, iodine deficiency, and smoking. Although only 1% of people have autoimmune thyroid disease (AITDs), 15% of people with normal thyroid function may have subclinical and localized thyroiditis and circulating antithyroid antibodies. Antibodies called anti-thyroid peroxidase (Anti-TPO) develop against a thyrocyte transmembrane protein that is implicated in the production of thyroid hormone. Thyroglobulin, a forerunner to thyroid hormone, is the target of anti-thyroglobulin (TG-Ab) antibodies. Since these antibodies are found in more than 90% of cases of Hashimoto's thyroiditis and more than 80% of cases of Graves' disease, anti-TPO antibodies (previously known as anti-thyroid microsomal antibodies) and anti-TG antibodies are regarded as diagnostic of AITDs. Anti-TPO and anti-TG antibodies are related to levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and both alone or in combination have been used to predict the development of hypo-/hyperthyroidism. As per the various research, the development of hypothyroidism in euthyroid subjects has been linked to altered levels of anti-thyroid antibodies and TSH. The etiology of Grave's disease is primarily characterized by the autoimmune production of TSH receptor antibodies (TR-Ab). TR-Ab is heterogeneous and may either stimulate the TSH receptor (TS-Ab, TSH receptor stimulating antibody) or inhibit it (TB-Ab, TSH receptor blocking antibody), or it may have no impact at all. The predominant type in Graves' Disease hyperthyroidism is TS-Ab. Abnormal serum thyrotropin (TSH) levels but normal serum-free thyroxine (fT4) and triiodothyronine (fT3) levels are indicative of subclinical thyroid disease. When TSH is 10.0 mIU/ml or higher, subclinical hypothyroidism is linked to an increased chance of cardiovascular events so early thyroid screening should be sought for timely intervention. TSH levels above 10 mIU/ml signify severe thyroid dysfunction, while those between 5 and 10 mIU/ml allude to mild elevation. There are a number of conditions that results in asymptomatic hypothyroidism, the most common being Hashimoto thyroiditis, followed by a history of thyroid surgery, the use of medications like lithium, anti-cancer medications, and amiodarone, etc. Factually, anti-thyroid antibodies are involved in the pathogenesis of autoimmune thyroiditis through complement-dependent cytotoxicity, thereby their appearance may actually predate the onset of overt thyroid disease or abnormal thyroid function tests over a number of years. Follow-up thyroid profile testing in anti-thyroid antibody-positive people is crucial for prompt diagnosis because anti-thyroid antibodies have been found in healthy individuals, particularly females. Over time, there has been a steady rise in the use of biomarkers to assess thyroid autoimmune risk and prognosis. Thyroid autoantibodies and genetic susceptibility testing are extremely prognostic of thyroid autoimmunity and thyroid dysfunction in the future.

Measuring serum Tg and anti‑Tg antibodies — Serum Tg measurement is the best means of detecting thyroid tissue, including carcinoma, and Tg levels vary with thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) manipulation; serum Tg generally does not increase as much after thyrotropin alfa as after withdrawal of thyroid hormone. Using current Tg assays, patients treated with radioactive iodine (RAI) with measurable serum Tg levels during TSH suppression and those with stimulated Tg levels > 2 ng/mL are likely to have residual/recurrent disease that may be localized in almost 50% promptly and in an additional 30% over the next 3 to 5 years. About 60% of patients who had total thyroidectomy and RAI with detectable serum Tg levels (which are < 2 ng/mL but > 0.5 ng/mL after stimulation) will have recurrences over the next 3 to 5 years, whereas only about 2% of patients with completely undetectable serum Tg after stimulation will have recurrences over the next 3 to 5 years. Among patients who have not had RAI due to low risk of recurrence, Tg levels remain low and stable, indicating that a low cut‑off (eg, 1–2.5 ng/mL) may be useful for these patients. In anti‑Tg antibody–positive patients before thyroidectomy, antibodies remained detectable for ≤ 20 years in some patients and the median time to disappearance was 3 years.

### Long-term follow-up of antithyroid peroxidase antibodies in patients with chronic autoimmune thyroiditis (hashimoto's thyroiditis) treated with levothyroxine [^113jwnHH]. Thyroid (2008). Low credibility.

Background

A number of studies show that the serum levels of antithyroid peroxidase antibodies (TPO-Ab) in patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis decline during levothyroxine treatment, but do not provide quantitative data or report the fraction of patients in whom test for TPO-Ab became negative ("normalization percentage"). The objective of the present study was to provide this information.

Methods

This was a retrospective study of TPO-Ab concentrations in 36 women and 2 men (mean age 51 ± 16 years; range 19–81 years) with Hashimoto's thyroiditis as defined by the following criteria: elevated plasma TPO-Ab and typical hypoechogenicity of the thyroid in high-resolution sonography at first presentation or during follow-up and low pertechnetate uptake in thyroid scintigraphy. When first studied 17 women and 1 man were not yet taking levothyroxine. The remaining 20 patients were receiving levothyroxine. At initial examination 18 patients had serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) concentrations above normal. Results of up to eight (mean = 5.8) measurements obtained over a mean period of 50 months while patients were receiving levothyroxine were analyzed. In addition, serum TSH, free triiodothyronine (fT3), and free thyroxine (fT4) were measured, and ultrasound of the neck was performed at each follow-up examination.

Results

In terms of TPO-Ab levels, 35 of 38 patients (92%) had a decrease, 2 patients had undulating levels, and 1 patient had an inverse hyperbolic increase in her TPO-Ab levels. In the 35 patients in whom there were decreasing TPO-Ab values, the mean of the first value was 4779 IU/mL with an SD of 4099 IU/mL. The mean decrease after 3 months was 8%, and after 1 year it was 45%. Five years after the first value, TPO-Ab levels were 1456 ± 1219 IU/mL, a decrease of 70%. TPO-Ab levels became negative, < 100 IU/mL, in only six patients, a normalization percentage of 16%. There were no correlations between changes in thyroid volume and changes in TPO-Ab.

Conclusion

Serum TPO-Ab levels decline in most patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis who are taking levothyroxine, but after a mean of 50 months, TPO-Ab became negative in only a minority of patients.

### Serum thyroglobulin measurement. utility in clinical practice [^114qVDZM]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

Serum thyroglobulin measurement has greatly facilitated the clinical management of patients with differentiated thyroid cancer and a variety of other thyroid disorders. Thyroglobulin autoantibodies remain a significant obstacle to the clinical use of thyroglobulin measurement. The interpretation of any given thyroglobulin value requires the careful synthesis of all pertinent clinical and laboratory data available to the clinician. The diagnostic use of rhTSH-stimulated thyroglobulin levels has greatly facilitated the follow-up of low-risk patients with thyroid cancer. Although the measurement of thyroglobulin mRNA from peripheral blood is likely to affect the future management of these patients, it is expected that serum thyroglobulin measurement will continue to have a principal role in the care of patients with differentiated thyroid cancer.

Thyroid nodule management — initial evaluation and laboratory testing — is based on high-resolution ultrasonography (US), sensitive thyrotropin (TSH) assay, and fine-needle aspiration (FNA), with thyroid scintigraphy not necessary for diagnosis in most cases; measurement of serum TSH is the best initial test and should be followed by free thyroxine (FT4) and free triiodothyronine (FT3) when TSH is decreased, thyroid peroxidase antibodies (TPOAbs) and FT4 when TSH is above the reference range, and a single serum calcitonin only when medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) is suspected due to FNA results or history, noting scintigraphy may be warranted in low TSH or multinodular goiter with low functional autonomy, most common in iodine-deficient areas.

Pregnancy — management of maternal hypothyroidism and positive thyroid peroxidase antibody (TPOAb) patients: When a woman with hypothyroidism becomes pregnant, the dosage of L-thyroxine should be increased as soon as possible to ensure that serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) is < 2.5 mU/L and that serum total thyroxine (T4) is in the normal reference range for pregnancy; in TPOAb-positive pregnancies, serum TSH should be measured as soon as possible and if ≥ 2.5 mU/L, treatment should be initiated. Serum TSH and total T4 measurements should be monitored every 4 weeks during the first half of pregnancy and at least once between 26 and 32 weeks gestation. Total T4 increases predictably in pregnancy, with the reference range ~1.5 fold that of the nonpregnant range; the upper limit of normal for the first trimester is generally < 2.5 mIU/L with respective upper normal values for the second and third trimesters approximately 3.0 and 3.5 mIU/L. Serum TSH levels decline in the first trimester and rise after 10–12 weeks gestation.

Serum thyroglobulin is used as a marker for monitoring differentiated thyroid cancer. There are a number of analytical challenges: the need for stability of the assay over decades, differences in assay bias, and interference in immunoassays by endogenous thyroglobulin antibodies. Improved precision at low analyte concentrations is desirable. Approaches to identifying assay interference are discussed. No single approach is likely to be successful on all occasions. Decision limits should be assay-specific, and clinicians should be aware of the limitations of current immunoassays.

Results

Baseline characteristics and clinical parameters of participants

A total of 3197 euthyroid women who met all the eligibility were enrolled in the analysis. Among them, 965 were TAI patients and 2232 were healthy controls according to the thyroid autoantibody levels. A comparison of the baseline characteristics between the two groups was summarized in Table 1. There was no comparability between the two groups in terms of BMI, smoking status, history of ≥ 2 first-trimester miscarriages, infertility duration, infertility type, and infertility cause, except for age [33.55 (30.66, 36.67) vs. 34.26 (31.21, 37.89), p < 0.001]. For ovarian reserve, the TAI group had higher bFSH value [7.22 (6.02, 8.87) vs. 7.48 (6.07, 9.22), p = 0.029], lower AMH value [2.66 (1.21, 4.53) vs. 2.21 (0.88, 4.00), p < 0.001], and fewer AFC [10 (6, 15) vs. 9 (5, 14), p < 0.001]. For thyroid function, as expected, the TAI group had lower serum FT3 value [4.39 (4.06, 4.74) vs. 4.31 (3.99, 4.70), p = 0.001] and higher serum TSH value [1.78 (1.26, 2.32) vs. 1.87 (1.30, 2.54), p = 0.001], but no differences in FT4 levels.

### Effect of thyroglobulin autoantibodies on the metabolic clearance of serum thyroglobulin [^115K7xio]. Thyroid (2018). Low credibility.

Background

In order to establish whether thyroglobulin autoantibodies (TgAb) influence the metabolic clearance of thyroglobulin (Tg) in humans, serum Tg and TgAb were correlated shortly after radioiodine (131 I) treatment.

Methods

Samples were collected from 30 consecutive patients undergoing 131 I activity for Graves' hyperthyroidism at the time of treatment and every 15 days thereafter, up to 90 days. Tg and TgAb were measured by immunometric assays (functional sensitivities: 0.1ng/mL and 8 IU/mL).

Results

Tg was detectable in all patients at day 0. Tg concentrations rose from a mean of 33.2ng/mL [confidence interval (CI) 17.8–61.0ng/mL] at day 0 to a mean of 214.6ng/mL [CI 116.9–393.4ng/mL] at day 30 and then steadily decreased, reaching the lowest concentration at day 90 (M = 10.9ng/mL [CI 5.5–20.9ng/mL]). Compared to their levels at day 0 (M = 23.6 IU/mL [CI 10.5–52.9 IU/mL]), TgAb remained stable through day 15 and then gradually increased up to a mean of 116.6 IU/mL [CI 51.9–262.2 IU/mL] at day 90. Patients were then split into two groups according to their TgAb status at day 0: undetectable (< 8 IU/mL; 9 patients) or detectable (≥ 8 IU/mL; 21 patients) TgAb. Compared to the other cohort, patients with detectable TgAb showed significantly lower Tg concentrations at day 0 (M = 20.3ng/mL [CI 10.1–40.2ng/mL] vs. M = 101.8ng/mL [CI 36.6–279.8ng/mL]), similar at day 15, lower levels at day 30 (M = 146.5ng/mL [CI 74.3–287.8ng/mL] vs. M = 514.8ng/mL [CI 187.8–1407.9ng/mL]), at day 45 (M = 87.5ng/mL [CI 43.1–176.6ng/mL] vs. M = 337.9ng/mL [CI 120.1–947.0ng/mL]), at day 60 (M = 61.6ng/mL [CI 31.0–121.4ng/mL] vs. M = 255.8ng/mL [CI 79.0–823.8ng/mL]), and at day 75 (M = 24.5ng/mL [CI 11.9–49.2ng/mL] vs. M = 249.5ng/mL [CI 63.5–971.1ng/mL]), and similar levels at day 90. Patients with detectable TgAb showed a lower (M = 182.5ng/mL [CI 92.0–361.0ng/mL] vs. M = 514.8ng/mL [CI 187.8–1407.9ng/mL]) and an earlier (day 15 vs. day 30) peak of Tg. The mean Tg concentration was lower in patients with detectable TgAb than in those with undetectable TgAb (area under the curve: 17,340 ± 16,481ng/mL vs. 36,883 ± 44,625ng/mL; p = 0.02).

Conclusions

TgAb influence the changes in Tg concentrations observed immediately after 131 I treatment, inducing lower levels and an earlier peak of Tg. These observations indicate that TgAb significantly influence the metabolic clearance of Tg, supporting the concept that their interference in the measurement of Tg is mainly due to an in vivo effect.
