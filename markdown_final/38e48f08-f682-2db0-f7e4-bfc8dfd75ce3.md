## Question

labs to draw for feeling down

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which laboratory tests to order for a patient who is "feeling down", i.e., evaluating depressive symptoms. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the diagnostic foundation and whether depression is a clinical diagnosis. Then, I should verify which medical conditions commonly masquerade as depression and truly warrant labs. Next, I will stratify by risk and pretest probability to avoid overtesting. After that, I should outline a minimal, high-yield panel and explicitly state what not to order. Finally, I will integrate special populations and close with a concise, actionable recommendation anchored to guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic foundation: major depressive disorder is a clinical diagnosis based on DSM-5/ICD-10 criteria and a structured history and mental status examination; there is no laboratory test that confirms or excludes depression, so labs are used to identify medical contributors, not to diagnose depression itself [^111vLA7b] [^111VP2Lj].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about ordering a broad panel; I need to check which medical conditions most plausibly present with depressive symptoms and are actionable. The recurring, high-yield entities across guidelines and reviews include thyroid disease, anemia/B12 deficiency, diabetes/hyperglycemia, renal and hepatic dysfunction, and medication or substance effects, with endocrine disorders like hypothyroidism and Cushing's repeatedly emphasized as treatable mimics of depression [^111VP2Lj] [^114A8X26].

> Next, I should review how to stratify testing by pretest probability and risk, because routine screening in low-risk patients yields low-value results and can cause harm through false positives, cascades, and iatrogenic anemia; I need to ensure I align with the principle that tests should be ordered only when results are likely to change management [^115MX39W] [^111jajAr]. In older adults, those with new-onset or treatment-resistant depression, significant medical comorbidity, or atypical features, the threshold for testing should be lower given higher prevalence of organic contributors; conversely, in young, healthy patients with classic depression and no red flags, selective testing is reasonable [^111VP2Lj] [^114A8X26].

> I will now examine a minimal, high-yield panel for most patients with depressive symptoms. Let me think about the essentials: a CBC to screen for anemia; a basic metabolic panel to assess glucose, renal, and hepatic function; and TSH to screen for thyroid disease. These three tests address the most common and actionable medical contributors and are consistently recommended in initial evaluations of depression and in general medical screening contexts that overlap with depressive presentations [^111VP2Lj] [^113M3Src]. Wait, let me verify the thyroid point: multiple sources emphasize hypothyroidism as a frequent, reversible cause of depressive symptoms, reinforcing TSH as a core test when evaluating mood complaints [^114A8X26].

> But wait, what if the patient is older, has cognitive symptoms, or reports neuropathy? I should add vitamin B12 in those scenarios because deficiency is not rare and can mimic or worsen depression; this is standard in the evaluation of cognitive impairment and is reasonable to extend to older adults with mood symptoms or neuropathic complaints [^113M3Src]. I should double-check that I'm not overgeneralizing; yes, B12 is not universally indicated in all depressed patients, but in the right phenotype it is high yield and actionable [^113M3Src].

> Let me consider substance use and medications, because I need to ensure I'm not missing iatrogenic or toxic contributors. A urine toxicology screen is appropriate when there is suspected substance use, medication nonadherence, or when results will change acute management or disposition; in ED psychiatric contexts, routine toxicology rarely alters care, but targeted testing can be informative for safety and referral planning, so I should align ordering with history and risk [^113e7LPD] [^111YovYR]. Hold on, I should verify that I'm not implying routine screening for everyone; I am not — testing should be guided by suspicion or clinical need [^113e7LPD].

> I should confirm what not to order, to avoid low-yield testing and patient harm. Routine cortisol or Cushing's screening is not indicated without clinical features such as centripetal obesity, striae, hypertension, or glucose intolerance; extensive autoimmune panels, heavy metal screens, or specialized endocrine testing should be reserved for specific phenotypes or refractory cases after the basics are unrevealing [^114A8X26]. Let me reconsider whether any guideline supports broad panels; I do not see support for routine expanded testing in uncomplicated depression, reinforcing a selective approach [^111VP2Lj].

> Next, I should review special populations and contexts. In adolescents and young adults, I need to check for eating disorders and pregnancy where relevant, so a CBC, CMP, and pregnancy test are appropriate when indicated by history or exam; in older adults, I should maintain a lower threshold for B12, renal/hepatic assessment, and thyroid testing; in primary care, if the patient has already had recent CBC, BMP, and TSH, repeating them without new symptoms is low yield and should be avoided [^114saQB4] [^111VP2Lj]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought to include ferritin routinely, but I should correct that; ferritin is not part of a standard depression workup unless there is concern for iron deficiency or restless legs/sleep disturbance, in which case it is reasonable to add selectively [^116Eeu93].

> I will now synthesize a practical, risk-stratified approach. For low-risk patients with classic depressive symptoms and no red flags, order CBC, BMP, and TSH, and add B12 if age ≥ 65 or if there are cognitive or neuropathic symptoms; for high-risk patients (older adults, new-onset or treatment-resistant depression, atypical features, significant comorbidity), expand to include B12, consider HbA1c if diabetes risk, and add targeted tests based on history and exam; for suspected substance use or when results will change management, include urine toxicology; avoid routine cortisol, autoimmunity, or heavy metal testing unless clinically indicated [^111VP2Lj] [^114A8X26]. Hold on, I should verify that this aligns with the principle of pretest probability; yes, this approach matches the evidence that testing should be driven by likelihood of actionable findings rather than blanket screening [^115MX39W].

> Finally, I need to ensure the plan integrates non-laboratory essentials so we do not over-rely on tests. The diagnosis of depression remains clinical, supported by validated screens such as PHQ-9 for severity tracking, and the initial evaluation must include a careful history, review of medications and substances, mental status exam, and targeted physical exam; labs complement, not replace, this foundation, and shared decision-making about testing reduces unnecessary procedures and patient anxiety [^111vLA7b] [^111VP2Lj]. I should double-check that I've emphasized follow-up and re-evaluation if symptoms persist or evolve, because new findings can shift pretest probability and justify additional testing over time [^111VP2Lj].

For a patient presenting with "feeling down", order a **targeted lab panel** to identify reversible medical causes of depression: CBC, CMP, TSH, vitamin B12, and fasting glucose or HbA1c. Add **urine toxicology** if substance use is suspected, and consider testosterone in men with low mood or sexual symptoms. Routine labs are not required for all patients; use clinical judgment to avoid unnecessary testing [^111VP2Lj] [^115HfGZ2].

---

## Essential laboratory tests

### Basic screening panel

- **Complete blood count (CBC)**: Screens for anemia, infection, or hematologic disorders that can cause fatigue and mood changes [^113M3Src].

- **Comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP)**: Assesses renal, hepatic, and electrolyte status; abnormalities can contribute to mood symptoms [^111VP2Lj].

- **Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH)**: Hypo- or hyperthyroidism can mimic depression and are common, treatable causes of mood symptoms [^114A8X26].

- **Vitamin B12 and folate**: Deficiencies can cause neuropsychiatric symptoms, including depression and cognitive impairment [^113M3Src].

- **Fasting glucose or HbA1c**: Screens for diabetes or prediabetes, which can affect mood and energy [^notfound].

---

### Additional tests based on clinical suspicion

| **Clinical suspicion** | **Recommended tests** |
|-|-|
| Substance use | Urine toxicology screen [^113e7LPD] |
| Hypogonadism in men | Testosterone levels [^notfound] |
| Autoimmune disease | ANA, ESR, CRP [^notfound] |
| Chronic infection | HIV, hepatitis B/C, RPR [^117GqKcA] |
| Endocrine disorders | Cortisol, prolactin, ACTH [^notfound] |

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

- **APA guidelines**: Emphasize a thorough clinical evaluation and selective lab testing to rule out medical causes of depression [^111VP2Lj].

- **AAFP**: Recommends targeted testing based on history and exam, avoiding routine broad panels [^notfound].

- **ACEP**: Advises against routine labs in ED psychiatric patients unless clinically indicated [^112RUEdD].

---

## Clinical judgment and patient-specific factors

- **Age**: Older adults may need broader testing (e.g. B12, RPR, HIV) due to higher prevalence of medical comorbidities [^notfound].

- **Gender**: Consider pregnancy testing in women of reproductive age [^116nsVFW].

- **Medical history**: Tailor tests to existing conditions (e.g. diabetes, thyroid disease) [^111VP2Lj].

- **Medication use**: Review for drugs that can cause mood symptoms (e.g. corticosteroids, interferon) [^notfound].

---

## Potential harms of unnecessary testing

Unnecessary testing can cause **false positives** that lead to anxiety, further invasive tests, and overtreatment [^111jajAr]. It also increases costs and healthcare utilization without improving outcomes [^114TSfrm]. Repeated phlebotomy can contribute to iatrogenic anemia, particularly in vulnerable patients [^116vjNHY].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Routine screening**: CBC, CMP, TSH, vitamin B12, fasting glucose or HbA1c.

- **Additional tests**: Based on clinical suspicion (e.g. toxicology, testosterone, autoimmune, infectious) [^111VP2Lj].

- **Avoid**: Routine broad panels unless clinically indicated [^111VP2Lj].

- **Use clinical judgment**: Tailor testing to patient-specific factors and history [^111VP2Lj].

---

A **targeted lab approach** for "feeling down" should focus on identifying reversible medical causes of depression while avoiding unnecessary testing. Use clinical judgment to select tests based on history, exam, and patient-specific factors.

### Diagnosis: making the best use of medical data [^115MX39W]. American Family Physician (2009). Low credibility.

To take the best possible care of patients, physicians must understand the basic principles of diagnostic test interpretation. Pretest probability is an important factor in interpreting test results. Some tests are useful for ruling in disease when positive or ruling out disease when negative, but not necessarily both. Many tests are of little value for diagnosing disease, and tests should be ordered only when the results are likely to lead to improved patient-oriented outcomes.

Abdominal pain is one of the most common presenting complaints to the emergency department (ED). More often than not, some degree of laboratory testing is used to narrow the differential diagnosis based on the patient's history and examination. Ordering practices are often guided by evidence, habit, consulting services, and institutional/regional culture. This review highlights relevant laboratory studies that may be ordered in the ED, as well as commentary on indications and diagnostic value of these tests.

Emergency department adult psychiatric patients — routine laboratory testing should be minimized using clinical assessment. In the alert adult patient presenting to the emergency department (ED) with acute psychiatric symptoms, the Patient Management Recommendations state: Level A recommendations. None specified. Level B recommendations. None specified. Level C recommendations. Do not routinely order laboratory testing on patients with acute psychiatric symptoms. Use medical history, previous psychiatric diagnoses, and physician examination to guide testing. The potential benefits of implementing these recommendations are described as economic and affecting length of stay, with reduced testing likely to reduce the total cost and lengths of stay for mental health patients, while potential harms note that certain subsets of patients (eg, elderly, immunosuppressed, new-onset psychosis, substance use) may benefit from more testing and that reducing testing in these cohorts has the potential for missing diseases in this population.

### Dysuria: evaluation and differential diagnosis in adults [^111Gwqad]. American Family Physician (2025). Medium credibility.

Dysuria, a feeling of pain or discomfort during urination, is often caused by urinary tract infection but can also be due to sexually transmitted infection, bladder irritants, skin lesions, and some chronic pain conditions. History is most often useful for finding signs of sexually transmitted infection, complicated infections, lower urinary symptoms in males, and noninfectious causes. Most patients presenting with dysuria should have a urinalysis performed. Urine culture should be performed for infection to guide appropriate antibiotic use, especially for recurrent or suspected complicated urinary tract infection. Vaginal discharge decreases the likelihood of urinary tract infection, and other causes of dysuria, including cervicitis, should be investigated. If a patient has persistent urethritis or cervicitis with negative initial testing, Mycoplasma genitalium testing is recommended. Clinical decision rules may increase the accuracy of diagnosis with and without laboratory analysis. Evaluation and treatment of dysuria through a virtual encounter without laboratory testing may increase recurrent symptoms and antibiotic courses. Persistent symptoms after initial evaluation and treatment require further workup for infectious and noninfectious causes.

### Reassurance after diagnostic testing with a low pretest probability of serious disease: systematic review and meta-analysis [^114TSfrm]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2013). Medium credibility.

Importance

Diagnostic tests are often ordered by physicians in patients with a low pretest probability of disease to rule out conditions and reassure the patient.

Objective

To study the effect of diagnostic tests on worry about illness, anxiety, symptom persistence, and subsequent use of health care resources in patients with a low pretest probability of serious illness.

Evidence Acquisition

Systematic review and meta-analysis. We searched MEDLINE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, EMBASE, PsychINFO, CINAHL, and ProQuest Dissertations electronic databases through December 31, 2011, for eligible randomized controlled trials. We independently identified studies for inclusion and extracted the data. Disagreements were resolved by discussion. We performed meta-analysis if heterogeneity was low or moderate (I² < 50%).

Results

Fourteen randomized controlled trials that included 3828 patients met the inclusion criteria and were analyzed with outcomes categorized as short term (≤ 3 months) or long term (> 3 months). Three trials showed no overall effect of diagnostic tests on illness worry (odds ratio, 0.87 [95% CI, 0.55–1.39]), and 2 showed no effect on nonspecific anxiety (standardized mean difference, 0.06 [-0.16 to 0.28]). Ten trials showed no overall long-term effect on symptom persistence (odds ratio, 0.99 [95% CI, 0.85–1.15]). Eleven trials measured subsequent primary care visits. We observed a high level of heterogeneity among trials (I² = 80%). Meta-analysis after exclusion of outliers suggested a small reduction in visits after investigation (odds ratio, 0.77 [95% CI, 0.62–0.96]).

Conclusions and Relevance

Diagnostic tests for symptoms with a low risk of serious illness do little to reassure patients, decrease their anxiety, or resolve their symptoms, although the tests may reduce further primary care visits. Further research is needed to maximize reassurance from medically necessary tests and to develop safe strategies for managing patients without testing when an abnormal result is unlikely.

### Clinical and nonclinical predictors of test ordering in psychiatric emergency [^111CXmDT]. General Hospital Psychiatry (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

This naturalistic prospective study explored the predictors of laboratory test ordering in a psychiatric emergency department.

Methods

We used a standardized questionnaire to collect clinical and nonclinical features in 527 consecutive patients.

Results

Test ordering was independently predicted by age, spoken language, referral by relatives, eating disorders, and somatic complaints. Having been referred by a general practitioner predicted test ordering only in the absence of a clinical report. Alcohol- and substance-related symptoms predicted test ordering only in patients older than 35 years. Age did not predict test ordering in patients consulting for anxiety or suicidal ideation.

Conclusion

Clinicians should be aware of possible biases when assessing the need of laboratory tests in patients presenting with psychiatric complaints.

### Methodology for constructing guidance [^112sHi4d]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2005). Low credibility.

Although guidance exists for the use of many laboratory tests in a wide range of clinical situations, this guidance is spread among a range of literature sources, and is often directed at laboratory specialists rather than test users. Individual general practices display large variations in standardised test requesting, yet much of their testing activity involves a relatively small range of tests. This paper describes a methodological approach to review the available evidence and guidance and to extract relevant primary research work to examine a range of testing scenarios in general practice, with the aim of formulating guidance based on the best available evidence or consensus opinions.

### When diagnostic testing leads to harm: a new outcomes-based approach for laboratory medicine [^111x3Ww5]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2013). Medium credibility.

The role of laboratory testing in establishing diagnoses

Diagnoses typically result from the patient history and physical. However, diagnostic testing is often used to confirm initial impressions or rule out alternatives, and at least 10% of all diagnoses are not considered final until clinical laboratory testing is complete. This number most likely underestimates the actual impact of testing on diagnosis. In the emergency room, clinical laboratory testing is ordered in more than 41% of all visits. Family physicians order tests in 29% of all patient visits, and general internists, in 38% of visits. These percentages would be even higher if the calculations were based only on the 33.9% of primary care visits that involve a new complaint.

Advances in technology have also contributed to the increased importance of laboratory tests. In the past, laboratory tests were used to identify organ and system dysfunctions or diseases. While this is still true, testing nowadays is used to diagnose disease subtypes, as occurs when pathology reports of cancer are accompanied by tumour-specific and patient-specific molecular analyses, data which help physicians determine optimum therapies and a patient's likely response to treatment. Laboratory testing is also increasingly being used to diagnose treatment failures associated with newer measures of effective care, such as reduced hospital readmissions. The clinical laboratory's growing significance may also reflect physicians' increasing reliance on objective data from diagnostic testing to partially compensate for reduced history and physical examination skills.

### Urine tests for Down's syndrome screening [^116MWxPw]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Down's syndrome occurs when a person has three copies of chromosome 21, or the specific area of chromosome 21 implicated in causing Down's syndrome, rather than two. It is the commonest congenital cause of mental disability and also leads to numerous metabolic and structural problems. It can be life-threatening, or lead to considerable ill health, although some individuals have only mild problems and can lead relatively normal lives. Having a baby with Down's syndrome is likely to have a significant impact on family life. The risk of a Down's syndrome affected pregnancy increases with advancing maternal age. Noninvasive screening based on biochemical analysis of maternal serum or urine, or fetal ultrasound measurements, allows estimates of the risk of a pregnancy being affected and provides information to guide decisions about definitive testing. Before agreeing to screening tests, parents need to be fully informed about the risks, benefits and possible consequences of such a test. This includes subsequent choices for further tests they may face, and the implications of both false positive and false negative screening tests (i.e. invasive diagnostic testing, and the possibility that a miscarried fetus may be chromosomally normal). The decisions that may be faced by expectant parents inevitably engender a high level of anxiety at all stages of the screening process, and the outcomes of screening can be associated with considerable physical and psychological morbidity. No screening test can predict the severity of problems a person with Down's syndrome will have.

Objectives

To estimate and compare the accuracy of first and second trimester urine markers for the detection of Down's syndrome.

Search Methods

We carried out a sensitive and comprehensive literature search of MEDLINE (1980 to 25 August 2011), EMBASE (1980 to 25 August 2011), BIOSIS via EDINA (1985 to 25 August 2011), CINAHL via OVID (1982 to 25 August 2011), The Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effectiveness (The Cochrane Library 2011, Issue 7), MEDION (25 August 2011), The Database of Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses in Laboratory Medicine (25 August 2011), The National Research Register (archived 2007), Health Services Research Projects in Progress database (25 August 2011). We studied reference lists and published review articles.

Selection Criteria

Studies evaluating tests of maternal urine in women up to 24 weeks of gestation for Down's syndrome, compared with a reference standard, either chromosomal verification or macroscopic postnatal inspection.

Data Collection and Analysis

We extracted data as test positive or test negative results for Down's and non-Down's pregnancies allowing estimation of detection rates (sensitivity) and false positive rates (1-specificity). We performed quality assessment according to QUADAS (Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies) criteria. We used hierarchical summary ROC (receiver operating characteristic) meta-analytical methods to analyse test performance and compare test accuracy. We performed analysis of studies allowing direct comparison between tests. We investigated the impact of maternal age on test performance in subgroup analyses.

Main Results

We included 19 studies involving 18,013 pregnancies (including 527 with Down's syndrome). Studies were generally of high quality, although differential verification was common with invasive testing of only high-risk pregnancies. Twenty-four test combinations were evaluated formed from combinations of the following seven different markers with and without maternal age: AFP (alpha-fetoprotein), ITA (invasive trophoblast antigen), ß-core fragment, free ßhCG (beta human chorionic gonadotrophin), total hCG, oestriol, gonadotropin peptide and various marker ratios. The strategies evaluated included three double tests and seven single tests in combination with maternal age, and one triple test, two double tests and 11 single tests without maternal age. Twelve of the 19 studies only evaluated the performance of a single test strategy while the remaining seven evaluated at least two test strategies. Two marker combinations were evaluated in more than four studies; second trimester ß-core fragment (six studies), and second trimester ß-core fragment with maternal age (five studies). In direct test comparisons, for a 5% false positive rate (FPR), the diagnostic accuracy of the double marker second trimester ß-core fragment and oestriol with maternal age test combination was significantly better (ratio of diagnostic odds ratio (RDOR): 2.2 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.1 to 4.5), P = 0.02) (summary sensitivity of 73% (CI 57 to 85) at a cut-point of 5% FPR) than that of the single marker test strategy of second trimester ß-core fragment and maternal age (summary sensitivity of 56% (CI 45 to 66) at a cut-point of 5% FPR), but was not significantly better (RDOR: 1.5 (0.8 to 2.8), P = 0.21) than that of the second trimester ß-core fragment to oestriol ratio and maternal age test strategy (summary sensitivity of 71% (CI 51 to 86) at a cut-point of 5% FPR).

Authors' Conclusions

Tests involving second trimester ß-core fragment and oestriol with maternal age are significantly more sensitive than the single marker second trimester ß-core fragment and maternal age, however, there were few studies. There is a paucity of evidence available to support the use of urine testing for Down's syndrome screening in clinical practice where alternatives are available.

### Signs and symptoms to determine if a patient presenting in primary care or hospital outpatient settings has COVID-19 [^115Bu5Vn]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) virus and resulting COVID‐19 pandemic present important diagnostic evaluation challenges. These range from, on the one hand, understanding the value of signs and symptoms in predicting possible infection, assessing whether existing biochemical and imaging tests can identify infection and recognise patients needing critical care, and on the other hand, evaluating whether new diagnostic tests can allow accurate rapid and point‐of‐care testing. Also, the diagnostic aims are diverse, including identifying current infection, ruling out infection, identifying people in need of care escalation, or testing for past infection and immunity.

This review is the second update of a review summarising evidence of the diagnostic accuracy of presenting clinical signs and symptoms for COVID‐19. This review is part of a suite of reviews on the diagnosis of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection and COVID‐19 disease, exploring the accuracy of antibody tests (Deeks 2020a), routine laboratory testing (Stegeman 2020), rapid point‐of‐care tests (Dinnes 2021) and thoracic imaging tests (Islam 2021).

Target condition being diagnosed

The key target conditions for this suite of reviews are current SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, current COVID‐19, and past SARS‐CoV‐2 infection.

For current infection, the severity of the disease is of importance. SARS‐CoV‐2 infection can be asymptomatic (no symptoms); mild or moderate (symptoms such as fever, cough, loss of smell (anosmia) or taste (ageusia), aches, lethargy but without difficulty breathing at rest); severe (symptoms with breathlessness and increased respiratory rate indicative of pneumonia and oxygen need); or critical (requiring intensive support due to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), shock or other organ dysfunction (NIH 2021). People with COVID‐19 pneumonia (severe or critical disease) require different patient management, which makes it important to distinguish between them and mild or moderate disease.

Thus, there are three target conditions for current infection:

SARS‐CoV‐2 infection (asymptomatic or symptomatic of any severity);
mild or moderate COVID‐19 disease;
COVID‐19 pneumonia (severe or critical).

Here we summarise the evidence on signs and symptoms; as a result asymptomatic SARS‐CoV‐2 and past SARS‐CoV‐2 infection are out of scope for this review.

### Signs and symptoms to determine if a patient presenting in primary care or hospital outpatient settings has COVID-19 [^114JuqCX]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Rationale

It is essential to understand the accuracy of diagnostic tests including signs and symptoms to identify the best way they can be used in different settings to develop effective diagnostic and management pathways. We are producing a suite of Cochrane 'living systematic reviews', which will summarise evidence on the clinical accuracy of different tests and diagnostic features, grouped according to present research questions and settings, in the diagnosis of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection and COVID‐19 disease. Summary estimates of accuracy from these reviews will help inform diagnostic, screening, isolation, and patient management decisions.

New tests are being developed and evidence is emerging at an unprecedented rate during the COVID‐19 pandemic. We will aim to update these reviews as often as is feasible to ensure that they provide the most up‐to‐date evidence about test accuracy.

These reviews are being produced rapidly to assist in providing a central resource of evidence to assist in the COVID‐19 pandemic, summarising available evidence on the accuracy of the tests and presenting characteristics.

### Multidisciplinary collaborative guidance on the assessment and treatment of patients with long COVID: a compendium statement [^111XbHUT]. PM & R (2025). High credibility.

Long COVID — diagnosis and initial assessment emphasize that holistic assessment should include a traditional history, physical examination, and additional diagnostic testing, as indicated, and that a positive COVID-19 test during acute SARS-CoV-2 infection is not required to diagnose Long COVID because there is no single laboratory finding that is definitively diagnostic for confirming or ruling out the diagnosis. A basic laboratory assessment is recommended for all patients with possible Long COVID, with consideration for additional labs and diagnostic procedures guided by the patient's specific symptoms.

### Health supervision for children and adolescents with down syndrome [^117HyB4B]. Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

Down syndrome — hematology and iron guidance includes newborn and ongoing labs: "CBC with differential" is recommended "By day 3", and later "CBC with differential and either (1) a combination of ferritin and CRP, or (2) a combination of serum iron and Total Iron Binding Capacity" is obtained "Annually". If sleep problems are present with low ferritin, "If a child has sleep problems and a ferritin less than 50 mcg/L, the pediatrician may prescribe iron supplement".

### Guideline summary review: an evidence-based clinical guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of low back pain [^113L8FBe]. The Spine Journal (2020). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for low back pain, more specifically with respect to laboratory testing, NASS 2020 guidelines recommend to insufficient evidence to recommend for or against obtaining laboratory tests to assess for inflammatory disease in patients with sacroiliac joint pain.

### Inflammatory bowel disease patient perceptions of diagnostic and monitoring tests and procedures [^117TfHnX]. BMC Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

For its part, the stool test ranks among the least ordered test/procedure and few patients refuse this test. This is the test with which patients feel the most comfortable. As with the blood test, concern about the results was low and the results did not generate too many concerns about the illness. Various laboratory tests are used in screening patients with suspected IBD. These tests make it possible to identify IBD patients who are relapsing or at risk of relapse. In the past, laboratory markers were underestimated due to their low specificity. Given that endoscopic assessment is invasive and requires significant resources, identifying biomarkers of an illness' activity becomes an attractive alternative. Fecal biomarkers can serve as surrogate markers of gut inflammation. For example, fecal calprotectin has become a clinical standard to assess IBD activity, predict relapse and monitor response to treatment. A study conducted among adolescents has revealed that, on one hand, they tend not to report all of their symptoms and, on the other hand, they are not embarrassed by the idea of collecting their stool. Thus, the stool test is appropriate and well received by this patient group. Although the study presented here was conducted with an adult population, the findings are consistent with those of the study conducted with adolescents. It indeed appears that the stool test was the test with which patients were the most comfortable and, even though it is the least-often explained by physicians, patients had a very good understanding of the need to undergo this test.

### Signs and symptoms to determine if a patient presenting in primary care or hospital outpatient settings has COVID-19 disease [^115srJRm]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Index test(s)

Signs and symptoms

Signs and symptoms are used in the initial diagnosis of suspected COVID‐19 disease, and to identify people with COVID‐19 pneumonia. Symptoms are what is experienced by patients, for example cough or nausea. Signs are what can be evaluated by clinical assessment, for example lung auscultation findings, blood pressure or heart rate.

Key symptoms that have been associated with mild to moderate COVID‐19 disease include: troublesome dry cough (for example, coughing more than usual over a one‐hour period, or three or more coughing episodes in 24 hours), fever greater than 37.8 °C, diarrhoea, headache, breathlessness on light exertion, muscle pain, fatigue, and loss of sense of smell and taste. Red flags indicating possible pneumonia include breathlessness at rest, loss of appetite, confusion, pain or pressure in the chest, and temperature above 38 °C.

Clinical pathway

Important in the context of COVID‐19 is that the pathway is multifaceted because it is designed to care for the diseased individual and to protect the community from further spread. Decisions about patient and isolation pathways for COVID‐19 vary according to health services and settings, available resources, and stages of the epidemic. They will change over time, if and when effective treatments and vaccines are identified. The decision points between these pathways vary, but all include points at which knowledge of the accuracy of diagnostic information is needed to be able to inform rational decision making.

Prior test(s)

In this review on signs and symptoms, no prior tests are required because signs and symptoms are used in the initial diagnosis of suspected COVID‐19 disease. Patients can, however, self‐assess before presenting to healthcare services based on their symptoms. This is in contrast to contact tracing, in which patients or participants are tested based on a documented contact with a SARS‐CoV‐2‐positive person and may themselves be asymptomatic.

Role of index test(s)

Signs and symptoms are used as triage tests, that is, to rule out COVID‐19 disease, but also to identify patients with possible COVID‐19 who may require further testing, care escalation or isolation.

Alternative test(s)

Chest X‐ray, ultrasound, and computed tomography (CT) are widely used diagnostic imaging tests to diagnose COVID‐19 pneumonia. Availability and usage varies between settings. We address these radiological tests in a separate review.

### Signs and symptoms to determine if a patient presenting in primary care or hospital outpatient settings has COVID-19 [^115ZNgKu]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Assessment of reporting bias

We aimed to publish lists of studies that we know exist but for which we have not managed to locate reports, and request information to include in updates of these reviews. However, at the time of writing this version of the review, we are unaware of unpublished studies.

Summary of findings

We have listed our key findings in Table 1 to determine the strength of evidence for each test and findings, and to highlight important gaps in the evidence.

Updating

As we will explain in the discussion, this review will no longer be updated in its current form. Resources allowing, we will consider updating this review when sufficient studies of high methodological quality become available examining the combination of signs and symptoms with other, easy‐to‐obtain information such as demographics, point‐of‐care test results, prior exposure to an infected person, and recent case detection rate. Another important outcome would be to investigate whether tests exist that identify people requiring respiratory support (SARS or ARDS) or intensive care.

### ACOG committee opinion no. 740: gynecologic care for adolescents and young women with eating disorders [^117YTkXG]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Medium credibility.

ACOG Committee Opinion No. 740 — clinical presentation and screening in gynecologic settings emphasizes that adult and adolescent females with eating disorders may present with gynecologic concerns or symptoms, including irregular menses, amenorrhea, pelvic pain, atrophic vaginitis, and breast atrophy. Simply asking the patient how she feels about her weight, what she is eating, how much she is eating, and how much she is exercising can help identify at-risk patients. A physical examination and laboratory tests are valuable in the diagnosis of an eating disorder. Recognizing risk factors for eating disorders can help to identify patients who should be further evaluated.

### Should antidepressants be used for major depressive disorder? [^111vLA7b]. BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine (2020). High credibility.

How is major depressive disorder diagnosed?

The diagnosis of major depressive disorder in clinical practice is based on the presence of certain symptoms according to the diagnostic criteria outlined in either the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) or the International Classification of Diseases-10th Revision. These two sets of diagnostic criteria are largely comparable. The diagnosis of depression as it is defined by these diagnostic criteria does not build on any aetiological or pathophysiological framework. The assessment according to the diagnostic criteria might be supported by a structured interview, such as the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview or the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM. The conduct of these interviews may take 15–60 min. There are no objective tests and no laboratory test (eg, blood tests, MRI scans) for depression or for validating the diagnosis.

### What patient factors are associated with clinician likelihood to order a test in a setting of low pretest odds of important pathophysiology? [^115c4Mii]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

In clinical settings where the diagnostic yield is low-defined as situations where there is a low probability that a harmful or treatable condition is present-diagnostic tests have more potential for harm than for benefit because they can contribute to overdiagnosis and overtreatment. To limit the potential harm of diagnostic tests, it would be helpful to improve our understanding of the clinician and patient factors associated with an increased likelihood that a clinician would order a test in a low-yield diagnostic scenario, given that good evidence suggests that these tests are ordered frequently in the course of routine practice.

Questions/Purposes

In a survey-based experiment that presented musculoskeletal specialists with patient scenarios that comprised randomized elements and a low probability of detecting a specifically treatable pathophysiology, we asked: (1) What patient factors are associated with the likelihood to order a test? (2) What surgeon factors are associated with the likelihood to order a test?

Methods

Members of the Science of Variation Group (SOVG; an international collaborative effort of fully trained musculoskeletal surgeons that studies sources of variation) were invited to participate in an online, survey-based experiment with an initial email and two reminders in November and December 2024. Among the approximately 200 participants who participate at least once a year, 80% (159 of 200) participated in this experiment (84% [134 of 159] orthopaedic surgeons, 91% [145 of 159] men, 51% [81 of 159] practicing in United States, 82% [130 of 159] supervising trainees). Even though the SOVG consists mostly of American and European White men (not by design, but by participation), we believe it provides a sufficient sample to study variation in care as the associations are likely reproducible in any sample with sufficient differences in opinion (although the exact numbers may vary). Each participant reviewed five scenarios depicting a low-yield diagnostic scenario (nonspecific pain with radiographs showing no signs of pathophysiology) with randomized factors including age, gender, anatomical area of the symptoms, patient language intended to represent a potential source of pressure, symptom duration and intensity, and activity limitations due to pain. Participants then rated their likelihood to order additional testing based on each scenario on a scale from 0, would definitely not order a test, to 100, definitely would order a test. Participants also completed the Intolerance of Uncertainty scale, a validated measure of a person's thoughts, feelings, and behaviors in situations characterized by ambiguity, uncertainty, and lack of control. Multilevel mixed-effects regression analysis was used to identify variables independently associated with the likelihood to order additional testing.

Results

Greater specialist likelihood to order a low-yield diagnostic test (overall median [IQR] of 60 [slightly more likely than neutral] [20 to 82]) was moderately associated with symptom duration with regression coefficients (RC) ranging from 10 to 25 for durations of 2 months to 1 year relative to 2 weeks; slightly to moderately associated with all levels of concern relative to "Is easily reassured and monitor things over time" (RC ranging from 6.6 to 19); moderately associated with pain intensity (RC 3.9; considered moderate correlation size given the range of pain intensity is 1 to 9, meaning the maximum mean difference between low and high pain levels is 35); and slightly associated with all levels of incapability relative to "is able to do all activities" (RC ranging from 5.2 to 9.3). The likelihood to order additional testing was not associated with surgeon level of intolerance of uncertainty.

Conclusion

The findings suggest that specialists may be more likely to order low-yield diagnostic tests with greater potential for harm (such as overdiagnosis and overtreatment) than benefit in settings of greater symptom duration and intensity, when patients express more limitations caused by pain, and when specialists perceive greater potential pressure from patients.

Clinical Relevance

Greater awareness and tools such as debiasing checklists (which provide a step-by-step approach of evaluating medical decisions) may help clinicians to limit unhelpful test use. Future studies are needed to further evaluate factors influencing surgeons to order additional testing, particularly in in-person care settings.

### Clinical utility of blood tests in elite athletes with short term fatigue [^112eK6Di]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine, in a population of elite athletes at their initial presentation with tiredness or fatigue, whether a set of haematological and biochemical investigations enhances the diagnostic process over and above the information gained from clinical history and examination.

Methods

A sequential series of 50 elite athletes were studied at the initial consultation for a primary complaint of fatigue, tiredness, or a synonym thereof. A standardised clinical history, physical examination, and series of haematological and biochemical test were performed. The effects of the results of the blood tests on the diagnosis made after the clinical history and examination were examined.

Results

In only one case did the test results lead to an alteration in diagnosis. Physical examination did not provide any findings that would not have been suspected from the history, except for a number of incidental findings not relevant to the presenting symptom.

Discussion

In cases of short term fatigue in elite athletes, a thorough clinical history is mandatory. Physical examination is unlikely to reveal any findings not suspected from the history. Routine ordering of a panel of blood tests at the initial consultation should be discouraged. Unless specifically indicated by the history and examination, investigations are not required at the initial consultation.

BQ1-3. Which diagnostic methods are frequently employed in Western medicine to diagnose depression?

Statement

Structured interview tools for diagnosis (consensus recommendation)

The diagnosis of depression relies on a comprehensive evaluation encompassing medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests and mental state examination.
The diagnosis of depression was conclusively established based on the diagnostic criteria specified in ICD-10/ICD-11 and the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders.
Structured interviews, such as the Composite International Diagnostic Interview, are essential for clinicians in accurately diagnosing depression.

Scales for symptom severity (consensus recommendation)

Self-rating scales: for example, the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire, the Self-Rating Depression Scale, the Beck Depression Inventory, etc.
Physician-rating scales: for example, Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale, etc.

Laboratory test (consensus recommendation)

Routine laboratory screening: blood, urine and biochemical tests, thyroid hormone levels, electrocardiograms and urine toxicology screening. Further immunological tests should be performed as per clinical indications (eg, autoimmune antibodies, etc)(online supplemental etable S2).

Brain neuroimaging scans (eg, cerebral computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging scans, etc) and the electroencephalogram.
Additional laboratory investigations should be conducted while considering the presence of concomitant physical illnesses.

### Clinical policy: critical issues in the diagnosis and Management of the adult psychiatric patient in the emergency department [^113e7LPD]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Emergency department (ED) laboratory testing for psychiatric patients — existing literature indicates that "routine or ancillary laboratory testing for psychiatric patients has little or no use in the ED". It is also stated that "subsets of patients with higher rates of disease (eg, elderly, immunosuppressed, new-onset psychosis, substance abuse) may benefit from routine laboratory testing", and that "although urine toxicologic screening has no benefit for the management or disposition of the patient in the ED, it may be helpful to obtain an objective understanding of the patient's potential substance abuse on transfer to a psychiatric facility". When transfer delay is anticipated, "it may be helpful to obtain a urine toxicologic screen in the ED, when feasible", and "agreement between the ED and local psychiatric facilities regarding minimal laboratory testing for psychiatric clearance should be mutually determined". Future direction is specified: "Future research should evaluate the use of routine laboratory testing for patients with acute psychiatric symptoms by prospectively enrolling patients in the ED on presentation, prior to final diagnosis and disposition".

### Why is there variation in test ordering practices for patients presenting to the emergency department with undifferentiated chest pain? A qualitative study [^114gUxgx]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Diagnostic investigations involving laboratory tests aim to: increase certainty of the presence or absence of disease; support clinical management; and monitor a patient's trajectory (eg, during or after treatment). It is estimated that 60%–70% of medical decisions are based on laboratory test results. Evidence shows that some 84% of people admitted to a hospital can expect to have at least one pathology test during their stay, usually within 4 hours of their admission as an inpatient.

Zhi and colleagues estimated that 45% of laboratory testing in healthcare is underused and 21% overused. Major international initiatives, such as Choosing Wisely, are seeking to reduce the inappropriate use of tests, treatments and procedures as part of a collaborative effort involving health professionals, consumers and specialist colleges, and societies and associations. The Sensible Test Ordering Practice initiative was developed in Australia to promote consistent and rational diagnostic test ordering practices in acute care settings. It involves the use of traffic light systems (green, amber or red) to restrict the range of tests that can be ordered depending on the seniority of the clinician — 'green' tests may be ordered by junior doctors, while more complex and expensive tests in 'amber' or 'red' require senior medical staff sign-off. The Australasian College for Emergency Medicine (ACEM) and the Royal College of Pathologists of Australasia (RCPA) have also developed a set of laboratory testing recommendations for adult patients attending the ED across a range of common presentations.

A retrospective evaluation of variation in requesting potentially avoidable tests for adult patients presenting to six EDs with undifferentiated chest pain found that almost one-third of tests ordered in the ED for these patients were 'generally not indicated' (GNI) by the joint ACEM/RCPA guidelines. A summary of the ACEM/RCPA pathology requesting guidelines for undifferentiated chest pain is presented in table 1. In light of such findings, the current study set out to undertake a qualitative investigation to identify possible reasons for GNI tests.

### Signs and symptoms to determine if a patient presenting in primary care or hospital outpatient settings has COVID-19 [^1144MpiB]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Index test(s)

Signs and symptoms

Signs and symptoms are used in the initial diagnosis of suspected COVID‐19 disease, and to identify people with COVID‐19 pneumonia. Symptoms are what are experienced by patients, for example cough or nausea. Signs are obtained by clinical examination. Signs of COVID‐19 examined in this review include lung sounds, blood pressure, blood oxygen level and heart rate.

Key symptoms that have been associated with mild to moderate COVID‐19 disease include: troublesome dry cough (for example, coughing more than usual over a one‐hour period, or three or more coughing episodes in 24 hours), fever at examination greater than 37.8 °C, diarrhoea, headache, breathlessness on light exertion, muscle pain, fatigue, and loss of sense of smell and taste (Struyf 2021). Signs and symptoms indicating possible pneumonia (severe or critical disease) include breathlessness at rest, loss of appetite, confusion, pain or pressure in the chest, and temperature above 38 °C.

Clinical pathway

Important in the context of COVID‐19 is that the pathway is multifaceted because it is designed to care for the diseased individual and to protect the community from further spread. Decisions about patient and isolation pathways for COVID‐19 vary according to health services and settings, available resources, and stages of the epidemic. They will change over time if and when effective treatments are identified and populations are increasingly vaccinated. The decision points between these pathways vary, but all include points at which knowledge of the accuracy of diagnostic information is needed to inform rational decision making.

Prior test(s)

Prior testing will depend on whether people are being investigated for SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, mild COVID‐19 or COVID‐19 pneumonia. In this review on signs and symptoms, no prior tests are required because signs and symptoms are used in the initial diagnosis of suspected SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, and in identifying people with mild COVID‐19 or COVID‐19 pneumonia.

Role of index test(s)

Signs and symptoms are used as triage tests, that is, to rule out SARS‐CoV‐2 infection or COVID‐19 disease, but also to identify people with possible COVID‐19 who may require further testing, care escalation or isolation.

### The ASAM / AAAP clinical practice guideline on the management of stimulant use disorder [^1127PEXj]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2024). High credibility.

ASAM/AAAP stimulant intoxication and withdrawal — laboratory testing: Laboratory testing can detect some acute issues and complications, but no research was identified on ordering routine or as-needed testing in patients presenting with stimulant intoxication or withdrawal; the CGC agreed that some tests may be considered based on symptomatology and presence of risk factors, and clinicians should consider a CBC (complete blood count), a CMP (comprehensive metabolic panel); liver function tests (LFTs); and markers for muscle breakdown (creatine kinase [CK], lactate), cardiac injury (troponin), and renal injury (BCR, urine albumin). When ordering a CBC, clinicians should be alert to neutrophil levels in patients with cocaine intoxication or withdrawal. Levamisole is a common adulterant in the cocaine supply and can cause immunosuppression — in particular, neutropenia — and small vessel vasculitis, and the degree of clinical concern varies by region and over time. While there is no direct evidence regarding infectious disease screening as part of the comprehensive assessment, these tests help identify common comorbid conditions; the higher prevalence of HIV, hepatitis, and STIs in patients who use stimulants justifies testing, and clinicians should consider all sites of sexual exposure, which may include urogenital, pharyngeal, and/or rectal, when testing for chlamydia and gonorrhea. For some patients, the impact of routine laboratory testing could be substantial given the benefit of early detection and treatment for some conditions, whereas for some diagnoses the effect of early detection and treatment is less substantial.

### Multidisciplinary collaborative guidance on the assessment and treatment of patients with long COVID: a compendium statement [^1156v3af]. PM & R (2025). High credibility.

Holistic assessment and ICD-10 coding for Long COVID — Long COVID can present as a wide variety of symptoms, either in isolation or more often in clusters, and when one or more of these symptoms occur a holistic assessment should include a traditional history, physical examination, and additional diagnostic testing, as indicated; a basic laboratory assessment is recommended for all patients with possible Long COVID, with additional labs and diagnostic procedures guided by patients' specific symptoms. When a patient is assessed to likely be presenting with sequelae of Long COVID, the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) diagnosis code of "U09.9 Post COVID-19 Condition, unspecified" should be documented as a secondary code and the primary ICD-10 code(s) should reflect the patient's specific presenting symptom(s) and condition(s); systematic inclusion of the U09.9 code facilitates population-level monitoring of Long COVID sequelae, and the U09.9 diagnosis code is not appropriate to use in cases of acute COVID-19 infection.

### Interpreting COVID-19 test results in clinical settings: It depends! [^114zC79e]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Tests for Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are intended for a disparate and shifting range of purposes: (1) diagnosing patients who present with symptoms to inform individual treatment decisions; (2) organizational uses such as "cohorting" potentially infected patients and staff to protect others; and (3) contact tracing, surveillance, and other public health purposes. Often lost when testing is encouraged is that testing does not by itself confer health benefits. Rather, testing is useful to the extent it forms a critical link to subsequent medical or public health interventions. Such interventions might be individual level, like better diagnosis, treatment, isolation, or quarantine of contacts. They might aid surveillance to understand levels and trends of disease within a defined population that enables informed decisions to implement or relax social distancing measures. In this article, we describe the range of available COVID-19 tests; their accuracy and timing considerations; and the specific clinical, organizational, and public health considerations that warrant different testing strategies. Three representative clinical scenarios illustrate the importance of appropriate test use and interpretation. The reason a patient seeks testing is often a strong indicator of the pretest probability of infection, and thus how to interpret test results. In addition, the level of population spread of the virus and the timing of testing play critical roles in the positive or negative predictive value of the test. We conclude with practical recommendations regarding the need for testing in various contexts, appropriate tests and testing methods, and the interpretation of test results.

Diagnostic formulation in suspected Alzheimer's disease and related disorders — three-step approach and implementation guidance emphasize that the first step is to delineate the patient's cognitive functional status, the second step is to characterize the specific clinical profile of the patient's cognitive–behavioral syndrome, and the third step is to establish the most likely brain disease (or condition) causing the clinical syndrome; a structured and individualized approach detailed in Recommendations 4 to 9 should be used, and for a majority of individuals with a typical presentation of dementia due to AD a first tier of clinical assessments, laboratory tests, and neuroimaging should be sufficient, after which clinicians decide if data are sufficient to reference established clinical diagnostic criteria or if additional tests or referrals are needed, noting that molecular biomarker confirmation may be desired and that despite increasing age raising the likelihood of multiple processes, a specific primary etiologic diagnosis is most likely and should be established and communicated.

Testing indications and timing — Early diagnosis of symptomatic patients hastens appropriate antimicrobial therapy, which typically reduces the severity and duration of symptoms and helps prevent complications. A diagnosis of babesiosis should be considered for any patient who presents with typical symptoms (especially fever, fatigue, chills, sweats, headache, and anorexia), characteristic routine laboratory test abnormalities, and who lives in, or has traveled to a Babesia endemic region within the previous month or who has received a blood transfusion within the previous 6 months. Most patients who acquire babesiosis through blood transfusion develop symptoms after a 1 to 9 week incubation period but it can be as long as 6 months.

### Appropriate use of drug testing in clinical addiction medicine [^111YovYR]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

ASAM appropriate use of drug testing — presumptive and definitive tests — states that presumptive testing should be a routine part of initial and ongoing patient assessment and should be used when it is a priority to have more immediate (although less accurate) results. Providers should know the cutoff threshold concentrations their laboratory uses when interpreting a report of "no drug present", and federal cutoff threshold concentrations used for occupational testing are not appropriate for clinical use. Definitive testing techniques should be used whenever a provider wants to detect specific substances not identified by presumptive methods, quantify levels of the substance present, and refine the accuracy of the results, and definitive testing should be used when the results inform clinical decisions with major clinical or non-clinical implications for the patient. If a patient disputes presumptive findings, a definitive test should be done, and when ordering a definitive test, providers should advise the laboratory if specific substances are suspected. Because not all laboratories automatically perform "reflex" testing of positive presumptive results, providers should be aware that a specific order may be required for definitive testing.

### Signs and symptoms to determine if a patient presenting in primary care or hospital outpatient settings has COVID-19 disease [^116ycKh2]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) and resulting COVID‐19 pandemic present important diagnostic evaluation challenges. These range from, on the one hand, understanding the value of signs and symptoms in predicting possible infection, assessing whether existing biochemical and imaging tests can identify infection and recognise patients needing critical care, and on the other hand, evaluating whether new diagnostic tests can allow accurate rapid and point‐of‐care testing. Also, the diagnostic aims are diverse, including identifying current infection, ruling out infection, identifying people in need of care escalation, or testing for past infection.

This review is part of a cluster of reviews on the diagnosis of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection and COVID‐19 disease, and deals solely with the diagnostic accuracy of presenting clinical signs and symptoms for diagnosing COVID‐19 disease.

Target condition being diagnosed

COVID‐19 is the disease caused by infection with the SARS‐CoV‐2 virus. SARS‐CoV‐2 infection is diagnosed with reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT‐PCR), which is a test that detects the virus' genetic material, with imaging to identify lung abnormalities and with clinical signs and symptoms.

SARS‐CoV‐2 infection can be asymptomatic (no symptoms); mild or moderate; severe (causing breathlessness and increased respiratory rate indicative of pneumonia and oxygen need); or critical (requiring intensive support due to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), shock or other organ dysfunction). People with COVID‐19 pneumonia (severe or critical disease), require different patient management, which makes it important to distinguish between mild or moderate COVID‐19 disease and COVID‐19 pneumonia.

In this review, we will examine the diagnostic value of signs and symptoms for symptomatic SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, which includes mild or moderate COVID‐19 disease and COVID‐19 pneumonia.

In planning review updates, we will consider the potential addition of another grouping, which is a subset of the above:

whether tests exist that identify people requiring respiratory support (SARS or ARDS) or intensive care.

### Health supervision for children and adolescents with down syndrome [^116xota4]. Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

Health supervision from 12 to 21 years or older — adolescence to early adulthood — states to follow Bright Futures schedule or more frequently as indicated and to obtain a history and perform a physical examination. Monitor weight and follow BMI trends at each health care visit; review weight and height using Down-syndrome specific charts and use these in conjunction with the Centers for Disease Control BMI chart, and counsel regarding healthy diet and a structured exercise program. Review feeding, ask about changes in eating patterns or respiratory symptoms with feeding, and ensure adequate iron intake. Obtain a CBC with differential and either (1) a combination of ferritin and CRP, or (2) a combination of serum iron and TIBC, beginning at 1 year of age and annually thereafter. A physician may elect to prescribe iron supplementation for adolescents/early adults with restless sleep and a ferritin concentration < 50 μg/L for children or 75 for adults. Palpate testes at each health supervision visit. Measure TSH concentration annually and obtain TSH sooner if there are symptoms of thyroid dysfunction, and measure TSH every 6 months if antithyroid antibodies have been detected. Obtain annual ear-specific audiologic evaluation, and if middle ear disease occurs, obtain developmentally appropriate hearing evaluation after treatment.

### The ASAM / AAAP clinical practice guideline on the management of stimulant use disorder [^117GqKcA]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Appendix I — Baseline laboratory testing for substance use disorder (SUD) — It is important for clinicians to deliver the full standard of care, including routinely ordering baseline laboratory testing for patients with a newly diagnosed SUD or psychiatric disorder. In non-acute care settings, clinicians should order the following clinical tests for most patients: complete blood count (CBC); comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP; eg, renal panel, liver function tests [LFTs]); screening for infectious diseases in accordance with current guidance; HIV and HCV for all patients; HBV for patients at increased risk for infection; screening for sexually transmitted infections (STIs; eg, gonorrhea, chlamydia, syphilis); and pregnancy testing for all patients with childbearing potential. Clinicians can also consider ordering the following clinical tests: tuberculosis (TB) for patients at increased risk for infection; HAV for patients at increased risk for infection; and other clinical tests as necessary based on clinical assessment, such as creatine kinase (CK) if signs of rhabdomyolysis are present.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for alcohol withdrawal syndrome, more specifically with respect to screening for comorbidities, ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend to in settings with laboratory testing access, conduct or arrange for a comprehensive metabolic profile or basic metabolic profile, a hepatic panel, and a CBC with differential to evaluate the patient's electrolytes, liver function, renal function, and immune function. In settings with limited laboratory testing access, obtain results when feasible to assist with treatment planning decisions. Address any detected nutritional deficiencies. Initial screening may also include laboratory tests for hepatitis, HIV (with consent), and tuberculosis.

Rapid molecular diagnostic testing — benefits and harms include that, when ideally completed while the patient is physically present, it allows management decisions related to treatment and isolation to be made and enacted quickly, may reduce the period of patient anxiety while test results are pending, and decreases concerns about losing patients to follow-up while simplifying follow-up; however, despite very high specificities, potential harms of false positive results include unnecessary isolation, anxiety, delays in investigating the true cause of symptoms, unnecessary therapy for COVID-19, increased days away from work or school, and unnecessary contact tracing.

### Diagnosis of meniere's disease: routine and extended tests [^111QSRH3]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

Meniere's disease can compromise the quality of life of some patients in a manner so seriously that it can cause social segregation, even from family. Hearing loss, tinnitus, aural pressure, and disturbances in equilibrium added to an emotional instability frequently present in these patients may take them to a progressive state of solitude and depression, marking their lives by personal tragedy and making life a living hell. The clinical picture of Meniere's disease fluctuates, however. Individually, subsidiary examinations become impotent in diagnosing Meniere's disease. To be called Meniere's disease, the cause must be unknown; otherwise it would constitute Meniere's syndrome. Taking all of this into consideration, one would call this an unusual situation, or at least confusing. The lack of an etiologic diagnosis in medicine always creates anxiety for doctors and patients. What is considered to be either a routine or an extended test may change from service to service. The physician does not need to order all tests. What the physician needs is a protocol he or she trusts. Test results can vary, even depending on the moment when they are performed. More important than the number of tests ordered is the strategy by which the tests should be put together at that certain moment. The authors believe that one should have his or her own protocol for diagnosis, always beginning with a detailed history taking being guided by them most of the time. It is the authors' understanding that patients with Meniere's disease should be followed closely by their ear, nose, and throat doctor in episodes of vertigo or fluctuation of their hearing, tinnitus, or aural pressure. Should the patient be experiencing a stable period, a clinical visit along with an audiovestibular workup should be performed at least once a year. By monitoring the course of the disease, clinicians would be able to detect early changes in symptoms and/or test results, giving them the possibility to intervene clinically as early as possible in acute episodes of vestibulocochlear disorganization, protecting the inner ear, and minimizing sequelae from spells of hydrops. The authors believe that only the association of clinical sense and as many subsidiary tests as are useful will lead to a desirable level of certainty in the diagnosis of Meniere's disease, and will allow clinicians to presume bilateral involvement, monitor the development of the disease, intervene in its natural course, and idealize appropriate treatment.

### AGA clinical practice update on evaluation and management of belching, abdominal bloating, and distention: expert review [^111Nz5Uz]. Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Diagnostic testing and imaging for bloating and distention — testing is selective and guided by alarm features and examination. "Symptoms of bloating and distention do not routinely require laboratory testing or obtaining radiologic imaging or endoscopy unless the history discloses concerning symptoms, an abdominal physical examination, or alarm features". The authors "advise ordering tests with worsening dyspepsia or abdominal pain, particularly of recent onset; vomiting; GI bleeding; unintentional weight loss > 10% of body weight; chronic diarrhea; or a family history of GI malignancy, CD, or inflammatory bowel disease". If visible abdominal distension is present, "an abdominal examination will help to evaluate for an abdominal mass", and with abnormal findings, "Any abnormalities would lead to a computed tomography scan or ultrasound of the abdomen to evaluate for ascites or a mass or to identify increased bowel gas due to ileus, obstruction, or pseudo-obstruction". The text adds, "Bloating and abdominal fullness are often presenting symptoms in patients with ovarian cancer; the highest risk is in women 50 years or older".

### Executive summary: evaluation and management of children and adolescents with acute mental health or behavioral problems. part I: common clinical challenges of patients with mental health and / or behavioral emergencies [^111DkGEV]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

Pediatric psychiatric presentations — emergency department (ED) medical clearance is described as excluding potential medical conditions causing or exacerbating psychiatric symptoms and evaluating for diseases or injuries requiring acute ED interventions. Some favor the term "medically stable", emphasizing that the goal is to rule out acute medical conditions rather than exclude all possible etiologies. For patients with unexplained vital sign abnormalities, a concerning history or examination, or new/acute neurologic or psychiatric changes, careful evaluation for potential underlying medical conditions may be important. Regarding laboratory testing, literature casts doubt on the utility of routinely obtaining laboratory or radiologic tests and supports the American College of Emergency Physicians position for focused assessments and judicious testing. Mental health consultants often request pregnancy (females), toxicology, and sexually transmitted infection testing for adolescent patients, and whether to obtain these tests can usually be decided via direct conversation between ED and mental health clinicians.

### Rapid, point-of-care antigen and molecular-based tests for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection [^115zzvDp]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Prior test(s)

Signs and symptoms are used in the initial diagnosis of suspected COVID‐19 infection and to help identify those who require a test for RT‐PCR. A number of key symptoms have been associated with mild to moderate COVID‐19, including: troublesome dry cough (for example, coughing more than usual over a one‐hour period, or three or more coughing episodes in 24 hours), fever greater than 37.8 °C, diarrhoea, headache, breathlessness on light exertion, muscle pain, fatigue, and loss of sense of smell and taste. However, the recently published review of signs and symptoms found good evidence for the accuracy for these symptoms alone or in combination to be lacking (Struyf 2020).

Where people are asymptomatic but are being tested on the basis of epidemiological risk factors, such as exposure to someone with confirmed SARS‐CoV‐2, no prior tests will have been conducted.

Role of index test(s)

For most settings in which testing for acute SARS‐CoV‐2 infection takes place, results of laboratory‐based RT‐PCR tests are unlikely to be available within a single clinical encounter. Point‐of‐care tests potentially have a role either as a replacement for RT‐PCR (if sufficiently accurate), or as a means of triaging and rapid management (quarantine or treatment, or both), with confirmatory RT‐PCR testing for negative results. Obtaining quick results within a healthcare visit will allow more appropriate decisions about isolation and healthcare interventions. If accurate, tests may also be considered for screening at‐risk populations, for example in airport settings or in local outbreaks.

Alternative test(s)

This review is one of seven planned reviews that cover the range of tests and characteristics being considered in the management of COVID‐19 (Deeks 2020; McInnes 2020). Full details of the alternative tests and evidence of their accuracy will be summarised in these reviews. Tests that might be considered as alternatives to point‐of‐care tests are considered here.

### The diagnosis and management of acute and chronic urticaria: 2014 update [^1126vuui]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

Chronic urticaria (CU) — diagnostic testing and laboratory evaluation are guided by history and examination; for patients with CU who present with otherwise unremarkable history and physical examination findings, skin or in vitro testing for IgE to inhalants or foods and/or extensive laboratory testing are not recommended. Targeted laboratory testing based on history or physical examination findings is appropriate, and limited laboratory testing can be obtained, with limited laboratory testing including a CBC with differential, sedimentation rate, and/or C-reactive protein, liver enzyme, and thyroid-stimulating hormone measurement. After a thorough history and physical examination, no diagnostic testing might be necessary for some patients with CU; however, limited routine laboratory testing can be performed to exclude underlying causes, and extensive routine testing for exogenous and rare causes of CU or immediate hypersensitivity skin testing for inhalants or foods is not warranted. Routine laboratory testing in patients with CU whose history and physical examination lack atypical features rarely yields clinically significant findings, screening for thyroid disease is of low yield in patients without specific thyroid-related symptoms or a history of thyroid disease, and current evidence does not support routine performance of ASSTs or autologous plasma skin tests in patients with CU.

### What do tests do for doctors? A qualitative study of blood testing in UK primary care [^11374rfa]. Family Practice (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Rates of blood testing are rising with significant geographical variability. Most research into diagnostic testing focuses on the role of tests in diagnostic decision-making.

Objective

The aim of this study was to explore the non-medical motives for blood testing by considering what tests do for doctors, through qualitative interviews with general practitioners (GPs).

Methods

We undertook 23 in-depth semi-structured interviews with UK GPs. Reasons for performing recent inflammatory marker blood tests were explored by reviewing GPs pathology inboxes to ground discussions in real-life clinical practice. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and analysed using a grounded theory approach.

Results

Blood tests offer doctors a tool to manage uncertainty; within a context of increased litigation, risk aversion and reduced continuity of care. Tests can also be offered as a 'gift' for patients, a way to be seen to be 'doing something'; in the social context of time pressures and perceived patient pressures. There was a tension however. On the one hand, doctors talked about using tests for reassurance and as a 'gift' offering 'truth'. Yet paradoxically, they also discussed the challenges of uncertainty and anxiety from inconclusive test results.

Conclusion

Our study emphasises that defining 'unnecessary' blood testing may not be as simple as determining medical criteria for testing; psychosocial reasons may be equally valid and interlinked. Further research is needed to help GPs manage uncertainty within the context of a risk averse society, and to explore the congruence and dissonance between doctors' and patients' perceptions of testing.

### The Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines on the diagnosis of COVID-19: molecular diagnostic testing (December 2023) [^112mfMGv]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

IDSA COVID-19 molecular testing — Recommendation 5 states: The IDSA panel suggests performing a single NAAT and not repeating testing routinely in symptomatic or asymptomatic individuals suspected of having COVID-19 whose initial NAAT result is negative (conditional recommendation, very low certainty of evidence). The panel considered symptomatic patients to have at least one of the most common symptoms compatible with COVID-19 (Table 1). While the yield of repeat testing is low and therefore repeat testing is not suggested routinely, there may be situations where repeat testing might be considered, such as development of new or worsening symptoms in the absence of alternative explanations, timing of symptom onset that might drive a need for repeat testing, or a poorly collected specimen that could yield a falsely negative result. If performed, repeat testing should generally occur 24–48 hours after initial testing and once the initial NAAT result has returned as negative, and another specimen type, preferably a lower respiratory tract specimen if the patient has signs/symptoms of lower respiratory tract infection, should be considered for repeat testing.

Hypersensitivity Reactions

Advise patients to immediately contact their healthcare provider if they develop a rash. Instruct patients to immediately stop taking CABENUVA and seek medical attention if they develop a rash associated with any of the following symptoms, as it may be a sign of a more serious reaction such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS)/toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) or drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS): fever; generally ill feeling; extreme tiredness; muscle or joint aches; blisters; oral blisters or lesions; eye inflammation; facial swelling; swelling of the eyes, lips, tongue, or mouth; difficulty breathing; and/or signs and symptoms of liver problems (e.g., yellowing of the skin or whites of the eyes; dark or tea-colored urine; pale-colored stools or bowel movements; nausea; vomiting; loss of appetite; or pain, aching, or sensitivity on the right side below the ribs). Advise patients that if hypersensitivity occurs, they will be closely monitored, laboratory tests will be ordered, and appropriate therapy will be initiated [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

### Medically unexplained neurologic symptoms: a primer for physicians who make the initial encounter [^1174PGuV]. The American Journal of Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Medically unexplained symptoms are ubiquitous in clinical practice. Medical use costs of medically unexplained symptoms are projected at approximately $256 billion per year. When initially seen, these symptoms are often baffling, not only to the patients but also to the physicians who encounter them. Because of this, properly diagnosing them is seen generally as difficult at best, leading to massive overuse of unnecessary testing. Subsequently, their management can be cumbersome. All this burdens the patients with unnecessary costs, financially and emotionally. This primer discusses historical perspectives of these and the changing nomenclature, and outlines how to think about these complex symptoms and neurologic findings that will enable a positive diagnosis rather than a diagnosis of exclusion. We also offer useful heuristic principles of their management so that physician-patient relationships can be better maintained and the quality of life of these patients can be improved by way of some simple, economic approaches.

### Multidisciplinary collaborative guidance on the assessment and treatment of patients with long COVID: a compendium statement [^11164n3v]. PM & R (2025). High credibility.

Long COVID assessment — common labs and procedures (Table 3) uses symptom-guided testing with "consider" language. For holistic assessment to rule out other (potentially treatable) conditions, obtain CBC with diff, CMP, TSH, and also consider ESR, CRP, CK, vitamins D, B1, and B12. For physical fatigue, to identify treatable contributors, consider ferritin, iron profile, testosterone, and estradiol. For breathing and respiratory sequelae, if not already performed consider chest XR; if breathing discomfort not improving ≥ 8 weeks after acute COVID-19 infection, or if new/worsened later in the Long COVID course, consider PFTs (FEV1/FVC and DLCO), ECG, and echocardiogram; if pulmonary exam, chest XR, or PFT abnormalities, consider noncontrast chest CT. For cardiovascular complications, if chronic chest pain suggests myocarditis consider troponin (preferably high-sensitivity); for decompensated heart failure consider BNP (preferably NT-proBNP); for PE consider D-dimer; if not already done consider ECG, chest XR, cardiac MRI (for myocarditis, if chronic chest pain and positive troponin), echocardiogram (for heart failure/valve abnormalities), and CT PE protocol (for PE). If concern for arrhythmia, consider Holter monitor for symptoms nearly daily, 14-day monitor for symptoms every few days, implantable event monitor for infrequent symptoms, and if initial work-up is unrevealing and/or to guide activity plan, consider cardiology stress test. For autonomic dysfunction and possible cardiac symptoms, if concerned for PE consider D-dimer; to identify treatable contributors consider if relevant autoimmune testing (ANA, RF, Sjögren's syndrome panel, antiphospholipid antibodies); if recurrent palpitations, tachycardia, or syncope, consider basic cardiac work-up, and if negative 10-min stand test, consider tilt table test; note that a tilt table test is not required to diagnose or treat autonomic dysfunction and can cause symptom flare. For cognitive impairment, to rule out other conditions consider thiamine, folate, homocysteine, magnesium, RPR, HIV, and neuroimaging based on history, exam, and lab findings, and see Table 12 for mental health screening tools. For neurologic sequelae, to rule out other conditions consider HgBA1c, vitamin B6, magnesium, RPR, HIV, with consideration of neuroimaging and consultation with a neurologist for further testing.

### A practical and evidence-based approach to common symptoms: a narrative review [^113vGfCJ]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Physical symptoms account for more than half of all outpatient visits, yet the predominant disease-focused model of care is inadequate for many of these symptom-prompted encounters. Moreover, the amount of clinician training dedicated to understanding, evaluating, and managing common symptoms is disproportionally small relative to their prevalence, impairment, and health care costs. This narrative review regarding physical symptoms addresses 4 common epidemiologic questions: cause, diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy. Important findings include the following: First, at least one third of common symptoms do not have a clear-cut, disease-based explanation (5 studies in primary care, 1 in specialty clinics, and 2 in the general population). Second, the history and physical examination alone contribute 73% to 94% of the diagnostic information, with costly testing and procedures contributing much less (5 studies of multiple types of symptoms and 4 of specific symptoms). Third, physical and psychological symptoms commonly co-occur, making a dualistic approach impractical. Fourth, because most patients have multiple symptoms rather than a single symptom, focusing on 1 symptom and ignoring the others is unwise. Fifth, symptoms improve in weeks to several months in most patients but become chronic or recur in 20% to 25%. Sixth, serious causes that are not apparent after initial evaluation seldom emerge during long-term follow-up. Seventh, certain pharmacologic and behavioral treatments are effective across multiple types of symptoms. Eighth, measuring treatment response with valid scales can be helpful. Finally, communication has therapeutic value, including providing an explanation and probable prognosis without "normalizing" the symptom.

### Cabotegravir sodium (Vocabria) [^113yuzrG]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Hypersensitivity Reactions

Advise patients to immediately contact their healthcare provider if they develop a rash. Instruct patients to immediately stop taking VOCABRIA and seek medical attention if they develop a rash associated with any of the following symptoms as it may be a sign of a more serious reaction such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS)/toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN): fever; generally ill feeling; extreme tiredness; muscle or joint aches; blisters; oral blisters or lesions; eye inflammation; facial swelling; swelling of the eyes, lips, tongue, or mouth; difficulty breathing; and/or signs and symptoms of liver problems (e.g., yellowing of the skin or whites of the eyes; dark or tea-colored urine; pale-colored stools or bowel movements; nausea; vomiting; loss of appetite; or pain, aching, or sensitivity on the right side below the ribs). Advise patients that if hypersensitivity occurs, they will be closely monitored, laboratory tests will be ordered, and appropriate therapy will be initiated [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

Hepatotoxicity

Inform patients that hepatotoxicity has been reported with cabotegravir [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3), Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Inform patients that monitoring for liver transaminases is recommended when VOCABRIA is used for HIV-1 treatment. Inform individuals that clinical and laboratory monitoring should be considered and APRETUDE should be discontinued if hepatoxicity is confirmed when VOCABRIA is used for HIV-1 PrEP [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

### Alzheimer's association clinical practice guideline for the diagnostic evaluation, testing, counseling, and disclosure of suspected Alzheimer's disease and related disorders (DETeCD-ADRD): executive summary of recommendations for primary care [^114sNXnu]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). Medium credibility.

While multiple barriers to timely diagnosis and appropriate disclosure of AD/ADRD exist in primary care, individuals with typical AD dementia can and should be readily diagnosed with confidence in the primary care setting. By gaining proficiency with the testing and processes recommended in this guideline, most PCPs should find it relatively straightforward to suspect and then diagnose dementia likely due to AD in a patient with a typical presentation of gradually progressive memory loss and difficulty with judgment and problem solving, and often spatial and/or temporal orientation, which have impacted ADLs, and in whom cognitive lab panel and brain MRI are also supportive (i.e. unrevealing in the former and consistent with AD in the latter). However, some patients — especially those who are relatively young — may not only present with an unusual history of subtle, atypical, or rapidly progressive symptoms but may also exhibit unusual signs on office‐based examination. Delirium and rapidly progressive dementia (usually defined as developing subacutely within weeks or months) are considered urgent medical problems requiring rapid, and in some cases inpatient, evaluation and management.

Atypical features may include prominent focal cognitive abnormalities (e.g. aphasia, cortical visual dysfunction), sensorimotor impairment (e.g. visual field cut, limb apraxia or rigidity, myoclonus, eye movement abnormalities, incoordination, gait abnormalities), or profound mood and behavioral symptoms (e.g. disinhibition, manic‐like behavior, flat or indifferent affect, or severe depressive or anxious mood or psychotic thought content). Patients with such signs on examination require an approach with a broader differential diagnosis, which often warrants specialist examination and distinct testing and studies to arrive at a diagnosis and appropriate interdisciplinary care plan.

Other patients may have a history and examination that are incongruent: for example, a patient may not have a history suggestive of delirium but on examination may be highly inattentive or exhibit signs suggestive of a toxic‐metabolic encephalopathy or a related syndrome. Still other patients may present with a history of substantial cognitive–behavioral change in daily life yet have what appears to be a normal examination in an initial office encounter. In patients whose examination may be difficult to interpret in the primary care setting, it is critical to consider and facilitate referral to a specialist with expertise in dementia; and to strongly consider neuropsychological evaluation. Evaluation for suspected rare or rapidly progressive dementia is complex, includes a very broad differential diagnosis, and is best performed by a dementia subspecialist.

### The diagnosis of depression: current and emerging methods [^113razUQ]. Comprehensive Psychiatry (2013). Low credibility.

Depression is one of the leading causes of disability in adolescents and adults, particularly starting from age 15 years and older. Diagnosis of depression has traditionally been made based on clinical criteria, including patient current symptoms and history. This process is widely used but relies on subjective interpretation. To standardize both the data obtained and data interpretation, various interview-based instruments and noninterview methods exist for screening and testing for depression in various clinical settings. This article evaluates the technical basis for and clinical performance of these various instruments and methods to diagnosis depression in clinical settings. Traditional tools include physician-administered or patient self-administered interview tools that have reasonable clinical accuracy depending on the threshold score and may lead to a full diagnostic evaluation for high-risk patients. In addition, older laboratory methods such as the dexamethasone test have contributed to the diagnosis of depression over a long period. Newer diagnostic methods such as genomics, proteomics, and metabolomics are technically sophisticated and objective and are beginning to emerge in psychiatry. Although promising, further evaluation of these methods is needed to fully demonstrate their clinical value and accuracy.

### To expand the evidence base about harms from tests and treatments [^111jajAr]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Rigorous evidence about the broad range of harms that might be experienced by a patient in the course of testing and treatment is sparse. We aimed to generate recommendations for how researchers might more comprehensively evaluate potential harms of healthcare interventions, to allow clinicians and patients to better include this evidence in clinical decision-making. We propose seven domains of harms of tests and treatments that are relevant to patients: (1) physical impairment, (2) psychological distress, (3) social disruption, (4) disruption in connection to healthcare, (5) labeling, (6) financial impact, and (7) treatment burden. These domains will include a range of severity of harms and variation in timing after testing or treatment, attributable to the service itself or a resulting care cascade. Although some new measures may be needed, diverse data and tools are available to allow the assessment of harms comprehensively across these domains. We encourage researchers to evaluate harms in sub-populations, since the harms experienced may differ importantly by demographics, social determinants, presence of comorbid illness, psychological state, and other characteristics. Regulators, funders, and editors might require either assessment or reporting of harms in each domain or require justification for inclusion and exclusion of different domains.

### Primary care physicians' challenges in ordering clinical laboratory tests and interpreting results [^111QKPnd]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

The number and complexity of clinical laboratory tests is rapidly expanding, presenting primary care physicians with challenges in accurately, efficiently, and safely ordering and interpreting diagnostic tests. The objective of this study was to identify challenges primary care physicians face related to diagnostic laboratory testing and solutions they believe are helpful and available to them.

Methods

In this study, sponsored by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, a random sample of general internal medicine and family medicine physicians from the American Medical Association Masterfile were surveyed in 2011.

Results

1768 physicians (5.6%) responded to the survey. Physicians reported ordering diagnostic laboratory tests for an average of 31.4% of patient encounters per week. They reported uncertainty about ordering tests in 14.7% and uncertainty in interpreting results in 8.3% of these diagnostic encounters. The most common problematic challenges in ordering tests were related to the cost to patients and insurance coverage restrictions. Other challenges included different names for the same test, tests not available except as part of a test panel, and different tests included in panels with the same names. The most common problematic challenges in interpreting and using test results were not receiving the results and confusing report formats. Respondents endorsed a variety of information technology and decision support solutions to improve test selection and results interpretation, but these solutions were not widely available at the time of the survey. Physicians infrequently sought assistance or consultation from laboratory professionals but valued these consultations when they occurred.

Conclusions

Primary care physicians routinely experience uncertainty and challenges in ordering and interpreting diagnostic laboratory tests. With more than 500 million primary care patient visits per year, the level of uncertainty reported in this study potentially affects 23 million patients per year and raises significant concerns about the safe and efficient use of laboratory testing resources. Improvement in information technology and clinical decision support systems and quick access to laboratory consultations may reduce physicians' uncertainty and mitigate these challenges.

### The Alzheimer's association clinical practice guideline for the diagnostic evaluation, testing, counseling, and disclosure of suspected Alzheimer's disease and related disorders (DETeCD-ADRD): validated clinical assessment instruments [^1122qHsh]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). Medium credibility.

2 CONCLUSIONS

The cornerstone of the diagnostic assessment of a patient with symptoms concerning AD or ADRD is the history and examination. Although advances in molecular biomarkers of brain diseases leading to cognitive impairment will likely enable their detection in some patients at an asymptomatic stage, the ability of proficient clinicians to recognize and diagnose patients in the early symptomatic stages of these illnesses is critical to optimize early management and hopefully minimize the adverse impact of these diseases on daily function and safety. Although it is common for a history to be taken and an examination to be performed without the use of specific validated instruments, evidence indicates and the DETeCD‐ADRD workgroup strongly believes that the use of such instruments will lead to better outcomes. Instruments to assess symptoms in daily life and their impact on function can be given to patients and informants prior to an office visit and can serve as a mechanism for structuring the history and efficiently identifying areas for focused clinical interviewing while also providing a list of pertinent negatives. A brief neurologic exam tailored to the patient is also important, as is a mental status exam augmented with a validated cognitive assessment instrument. The score on the test should not be interpreted in isolation, but should be integrated with information from the HPI, the patient's demographic background and psychosocial history, family history and other information relevant to the risk profile, medical history, medications, and other relevant information. For proficient clinicians, the synthesis of this information should lead to a diagnostic formulation of the patient's cognitive functional status and cognitive‐behavioral syndrome. In some cases, neuropsychological assessment or additional consultation(s) may be required to develop or further refine these first two steps of the diagnostic formulation.

If a patient has MCI or dementia, an evaluation should be done to determine the likely etiology, if possible, as discussed extensively in the companion articles. These diagnostic elements set prior probabilities on the differential diagnosis of likely etiology (‐ies), which informs clinical decision making regarding Tier 1 to 4 tests and other assessments in the evaluation process. See the primary care companion article for discussion of structural neuroimaging and cognitive lab panel blood tests. In some cases, the steps in this process may be relatively straightforward, and in others they may be quite complex. See the specialty care companion article for discussion of specialized functional and molecular neuroimaging and for fluid molecular biomarkers. Ultimately, the evaluation process should lead to a diagnostic formulation that is communicated clearly and compassionately to the patient and care partner, along with a discussion of management and prognosis.

### Etravirine [^113qWtF6]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Severe Skin Reactions

Inform patients that severe and potentially life-threatening rash has been reported with etravirine. Rash has been reported most commonly in the first 6 weeks of therapy. Advise patients to immediately contact their healthcare provider if they develop rash. Instruct patients to immediately stop taking etravirine and seek medical attention if they develop a rash associated with any of the following symptoms as it may be a sign of a more serious reaction such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis or severe hypersensitivity: fever, generally ill feeling, extreme tiredness, muscle or joint aches, blisters, oral lesions, eye inflammation, facial swelling, swelling of the eyes, lips, mouth, breathing difficulty, and/or signs and symptoms of liver problems (e.g., yellowing of your skin or whites of your eyes, dark or tea colored urine, pale colored stools/bowel movements, nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, or pain, aching or sensitivity on your right side below your ribs). Patients should understand that if severe rash occurs, they will be closely monitored, laboratory tests will be ordered and appropriate therapy will be initiated [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Drug Interactions

Etravirine may interact with many drugs; therefore, advise patients to report to their healthcare provider the use of any other prescription or nonprescription medication or herbal products, including St. John's wort [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^114Rbqmx]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Alcohol withdrawal — evaluation for concurrent medical conditions: When assessing for concurrent medical conditions, screen patients for medical conditions that could affect the course of alcohol withdrawal or treatment of alcohol withdrawal, as well as common chronic conditions that are associated with alcohol use disorders. A pregnancy test should be obtained for women of childbearing potential. In settings with access to laboratory testing, clinicians should conduct and/or arrange for a comprehensive metabolic profile (CMP) or basic metabolic profile (BMP), a hepatic panel, and a complete blood count with differential to assess a patient's electrolytes, liver functioning, renal functioning, and immune functioning; initial screening may also include laboratory tests for hepatitis, Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) (with consent), and tuberculosis. Do not delay the initiation of treatment if alcohol withdrawal is suspected but laboratory test results are not available at the treatment setting or results are pending.

### The AUA / SUFU guideline on the diagnosis and treatment of idiopathic overactive bladder [^117B1n6h]. The Journal of Urology (2024). High credibility.

AUA/SUFU Guideline — initial evaluation and telemedicine for overactive bladder (OAB) emphasizes that in the initial office evaluation of patients presenting with symptoms suggestive of OAB, clinicians should obtain a medical history with comprehensive assessment of bladder symptoms, conduct a physical examination, and perform a urinalysis to exclude microhematuria and infection (Clinical Principle). Clinicians may offer telemedicine to initially evaluate patients with symptoms suggestive of OAB with the understanding that a physical exam will not be performed and urinalysis should be obtained at a local laboratory (or recent lab results reviewed, if available) (Expert Opinion).

### Clinical research challenges posed by difficult-to-treat depression [^114A8X26]. Psychological Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Challenges in identifying DTD patients for intervention trials

What are the preferred evaluations when DTD is suspected?

The consensus report recommended that a broad set of evaluations be considered when DTD is suspected (McAllister-Williams et al.) to identify overlooked modifiable causes of the depression. For example, depression may be a manifestation of undiagnosed endocrine disorders [e.g. hypothyroidism (Duntas & Maillis; Hage & Azar,) or Cushing's syndrome (Arnaldi et al; Pivonello et al; Sonino, Fava, Raffi, Boscaro, & Fallo,)]. However, beyond clinical consensus, there is little empirical guidance on the relative costs and yield of these potential diagnostic tests and procedures. Relevant issues include whether assessment algorithms are specified by symptomatic presentation, treatment history, or sociodemographic characteristics. Similarly, evidence is currently incomplete regarding the potential of pharmacogenetic/genomic testing to identify or subgroup DTD (Vittengl, Clark, Thase, & Jarrett; Zeier et al.). How these issues are resolved will impact the inclusion and exclusion criteria used by intervention researchers to define DTD.

### Iatrogenic anemia (can it be prevented?) [^116vjNHY]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2014). Low credibility.

'Iatrogenic anemia' is a condition of lowered hematocrit and hemoglobin count resulting from large or frequent removal of blood samples, usually for laboratory testing. It is frequently seen in patients who are already suffering from bone marrow depression, and thus may become a comorbidity. Because several different types of chemical agents may be required for test procedures, a large volume of blood could be removed for each set of testing, perhaps 50–60 mL. Often local and reference laboratories request larger samples than are really necessary to perform a given test and still have some left to perform any required repeat testing. My experience shows that a volume of about 3 mL of each type of sample should be sufficient for this purpose.

### Gentamicin sulfate (gentamicin sulfate in sodium chloride) [^113Jo159]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

Information for Patients

Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including Gentamicin Sulfate in 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When Gentamicin Sulfate in 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by Gentamicin Sulfate in 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection or other antibacterial drugs in the future.

Laboratory Tests

Laboratory abnormalities possibly related to gentamicin include: increased levels of serum transaminase (SGOT, SGPT), serum LDH and billirubin; decreased serum calcium, magnesium, sodium and potassium; anemia, leukopenia, granulocytopenia, transient agranulocytosis, eosinophilia, increased and decreased reticulocyte counts and thrombocytopenia. While clinical laboratory test abnormalities may be isolated findings, they may also be associated with clinically related signs and symptoms. For example, tetany and muscle weakness may be associated with hypomagnesemia, hypocalcemia, and hypokalemia.

### Heterogeneity in the evaluation of suspected MIS-C: a cross-sectional vignette-based survey [^113tgBUu]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) is an emerging complication of COVID-19 which lacks a definitive diagnostic test and evidence-based guidelines for workup. We sought to assess practitioners' preferences when initiating a workup for pediatric patients presenting with symptoms concerning for MIS-C.

Methods

In a cross-sectional vignette-based survey, providers were presented with clinical vignettes of a patient presenting with 24 h of fever from a community with high rates of COVID-19. Respondents were asked about their general practices in pursuing a workup for potential MIS-C including testing obtained, criteria for diagnosis, and timing to confirm or rule out the diagnosis.

Results

Most of the 174 respondents were physicians from the United States at academic medical centers. The majority of providers would not initiate MIS-C workup for fever and non-specific symptoms unless the fever lasted more than 72 h. Skin rash, abdominal pain, and shortness of breath were symptoms that raised greatest concern for MIS-C. Most providers would obtain COVID-19 PCR or antigen testing, plus blood work, in the initial workup. The list of laboratory studies providers would obtain is extensive. Providers primarily rely on cardiac involvement to confirm a MIS-C diagnosis, and establishing a diagnosis takes 24–48 h.

Conclusions

Significant heterogeneity exists amongst providers as to when to initiate the MIS-C workup, the order and content of the workup, and how to definitively diagnose MIS-C. A diagnostic test with high sensitivity and specificity for MIS-C and refined evidence-based guidelines are needed to expedite diagnosis and treatment.

### Dynamic testing in Cushing's syndrome [^114jJeVs]. Pituitary (2008). Low credibility.

Endogenous Cushing's syndrome (CS) results from chronic exposure to excess glucocorticoids. CS can be ACTH-dependent, caused by ACTH-secreting pituitary or ectopic tumours, or ACTH-independent, caused by cortisol-secreting adrenal tumours. CS can be an extremely difficult diagnosis to make, and assessment will include clinical, biochemical and radiological evaluation. Several screening tests are used for the confirmation of hyper-cortisolaemia and its differentiation from other, more frequent, clinical abnormalities, such as simple obesity, hypertension, depression etc. Other dynamic tests are useful for establishing the aetiology. We have reviewed the current literature on the diagnosis of CS, and based on these data and our own experience, suggest the most useful tests and diagnostic criteria to be used. We conclude that even though laboratory testing is a fundamental part of the investigation of patients with CS, the interpretation of the tests should always be performed with extreme care, as none of the tests has proven fully capable of distinguishing all cases of CS. The biochemical results should be interpreted jointly with the clinical aspects and the radiology findings in a probabilistic matrix, and not as part of a uniform algorithm.
