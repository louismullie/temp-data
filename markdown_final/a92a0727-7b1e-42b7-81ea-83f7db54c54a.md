## Question

PRES on MRI clinical significance

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the clinical significance of MRI findings in posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about MRI's role as the diagnostic cornerstone and how it distinguishes PRES from its mimics. Then, I should characterize the core MRI patterns and sequences that establish vasogenic edema and define atypical variants. Next, I will examine diffusion, susceptibility, and contrast-enhancement findings and what they mean prognostically. After that, I should correlate MRI phenotypes with etiologies and age groups. Then, I need to link imaging to management priorities and timing. Finally, I will integrate pathophysiology and synthesize a concise clinical takeaway that is both practical and risk-stratified, making sure I verify each step with appropriate citations as I go.

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic frame. PRES is a clinicoradiologic entity, so MRI is not optional; it is integral to diagnosis and to separating PRES from stroke, reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome (RCVS), progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, and demyelinating diseases, which can look similar clinically but differ on MRI pattern and ancillary sequences, especially DWI/ADC and vascular imaging; this is why early MRI in the right clinical context is emphasized in emergency and critical care settings to avoid misdiagnosis and delays in therapy [^111ExVPN] [^111rjzD9] [^116NHgW2] [^113PZ1kx].

> I will now examine the core imaging phenotype. Classically, MRI shows vasogenic edema as T2-FLAIR hyperintensity with relative DWI isointensity and elevated ADC, typically in parieto-occipital cortical–subcortical regions, yet I should not over-assume strict posterior confinement because frontal, temporal, cerebellar, deep white matter, basal ganglia, brainstem, and splenial involvement are well documented and support the recognized anatomical heterogeneity of PRES patterns, including dominant parieto-occipital, holohemispheric watershed, and superior frontal sulcal variants [^111ExVPN] [^117Eiyq3] [^1149dyFe].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about reversibility or posterior restriction. PRES is often posterior and reversible, but MRI repeatedly shows anterior and infratentorial disease and, in severe forms, irreversible injury can occur, so I should emphasize that distribution and outcome vary with burden of edema and complications, not just the label of the syndrome itself [^1149dyFe] [^114WAC5Z] [^111ExVPN].

> Next, I should review diffusion imaging carefully because it shifts prognosis. Typical vasogenic edema appears with increased ADC, but restricted diffusion indicating cytotoxic injury may coexist and portends worse outcomes; pediatric cohorts show higher rates of diffusion restriction than adults, and pseudonormalized DWI hyperintensity with normal ADC can herald infarction on follow-up, so I need to verify diffusion metrics across lesions rather than assume uniform vasogenic edema [^1172SVHP] [^113hhxso] [^113xMSMa] [^114WXLK7].

> Wait, I need to check the hemorrhage dimension because conventional sequences can underestimate it. Hemorrhage is reported in roughly 15–36% on routine imaging, but susceptibility-weighted imaging reveals microhemorrhages in the majority, with many persisting on follow-up; this changes both our detection sensitivity and our counseling about potential complications even when conventional sequences look "clean" [^1172SVHP] [^111qAb5Y] [^112JdsMK].

> Let me consider gadolinium enhancement and vascular–meningeal signals. Contrast enhancement occurs in a substantial subset, often leptomeningeal or cortical, without a clear independent prognostic association, and delayed CSF enhancement on FLAIR can appear in severe hypertensive presentations, which aligns with endothelial leak physiology; I should confirm enhancement patterns but avoid over-interpreting them prognostically in isolation [^1162i8fp] [^112bU3jr].

> Now, I should confirm which MRI features best stratify prognosis. Extensive vasogenic edema, diffusion restriction, and hemorrhage with mass effect independently associate with worse discharge outcomes; ADC reduction clusters with poor outcomes, and both hemorrhage and DWI restriction track strongly with brain sequelae, so documenting the extent of edema and any cytotoxic component on the first MRI meaningfully informs risk and disposition planning [^1172SVHP] [^111ExVPN] [^112Gprhc] [^113xMSMa].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought radiologic recovery was uniformly rapid; let me verify the timeline. Clinical recovery often precedes imaging, with symptoms improving in about a week, while MRI abnormalities typically resolve in 1–2 weeks but can take up to 4–6 weeks, and not all patients fully normalize, which underscores the need for follow-up imaging to detect evolving infarction or hemorrhage and to document resolution when management hinges on reversibility [^116QvyFH] [^116bUrCk] [^114WAC5Z].

> Next, I should review etiologic and age-related correlations that MRI can suggest. Severe hypertension correlates with deep brain involvement and higher odds of diffusion restriction, autoimmune disease increases risks of hemorrhage and diffusion restriction, preeclampsia–eclampsia tends to show more regions involved with possible basal ganglia predilection, pediatric PRES more often demonstrates temporal lobe involvement and diffusion restriction with less cerebellar disease, and oncology cohorts show frequent hemorrhage amplified by thrombocytopenia and worse outcomes with imaging delays, all of which can be inferred or supported by MRI patterns at the bedside [^112Gprhc] [^113LD1py] [^113hhxso] [^115ejpuY] [^112JdsMK].

> I need to ensure the management implications are explicit and time-sensitive. Early recognition and immediate MRI facilitate prompt blood pressure control, trigger withdrawal, and seizure management; delayed imaging correlates with worse outcomes, and BP reduction should be controlled and gradual to avoid hypoperfusion injury; additionally, some drugs carry explicit PRES risk warnings, making MRI confirmation and medication cessation decisive steps when compatible neurologic syndromes emerge [^113PZ1kx] [^112JdsMK] [^117Ku7Jr] [^114SAK1q].

> Let me verify the pathophysiologic links that MRI and angiography support. Competing mechanisms include autoregulatory failure with hyperperfusion and endothelial dysfunction with vasoconstriction and hypoperfusion; catheter angiography and MRA frequently show reversible vasculopathy, and innate immune activation with monocyte subset shifts correlates with disease severity, which coheres with an endothelial injury model underlying the MRI edema spectrum and its complications [^116NHgW2] [^114JLAmf] [^112gtH1G] [^1169DTw1].

> But wait, what if the clinician assumes PRES is benign because it is "reversible"; I should correct that framing. PRES and RCVS both carry significant risks of ischemic stroke and intracranial hemorrhage, with a substantial minority experiencing complicated courses, so MRI is not just confirmatory but a tool to anticipate who needs escalated monitoring, neurocritical care, and closer follow-up to mitigate permanent deficits [^116XS6bG] [^111rjzD9].

> Final synthesis: MRI is the diagnostic anchor in PRES, delineating vasogenic edema patterns, unmasking cytotoxic components, detecting overt and occult hemorrhage, and clarifying vascular dynamics; these features together stratify prognosis, suggest the precipitating mechanism, and direct urgent therapy, while follow-up MRI ensures evolution toward resolution rather than infarction or hemorrhage; critically, I need to remember that PRES is neither strictly posterior nor reliably reversible, and high-quality sequences obtained early, including DWI/ADC and SWI with consideration of contrast and vascular imaging, are central to optimizing outcomes and preventing misdiagnosis [^111ExVPN] [^117Eiyq3] [^111qAb5Y] [^114JLAmf] [^1149dyFe].

PRES on MRI is clinically significant because it enables **early, accurate diagnosis** [^111ExVPN] of a reversible syndrome, guiding prompt blood pressure control, seizure management [^113PZ1kx], and removal of triggers to prevent permanent injury [^111rjzD9]. MRI shows **vasogenic edema** [^114WAC5Z] (T2/FLAIR hyperintensity, high ADC [^113Tm2a3]) that typically resolves with treatment, but diffusion restriction [^1172SVHP] or hemorrhage indicate higher risk of infarction or lasting deficits [^113xMSMa]. Recognizing PRES on MRI helps distinguish it from stroke [^116NHgW2], demyelination, or infection, informs prognosis [^111ExVPN], and directs follow-up imaging to confirm resolution or detect complications [^113PZ1kx].

---

## MRI findings and clinical significance

MRI is the **gold standard** for diagnosing PRES and has characteristic findings with direct clinical implications:

- **Vasogenic edema**: T2/FLAIR hyperintensity in parieto-occipital regions [^111ExVPN]; often symmetric but can involve frontal, temporal, cerebellar, brainstem, basal ganglia, or deep white matter [^117Eiyq3].

- **Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI)**: Typically shows high ADC (vasogenic edema) [^113Tm2a3]; restricted diffusion indicates cytotoxic edema and higher risk of infarction and poor outcome [^1172SVHP].

- **Hemorrhage**: SWI detects microhemorrhages or larger bleeds [^111qAb5Y], indicating severe endothelial injury and higher risk of permanent deficits [^1172SVHP].

- **Contrast enhancement**: Leptomeningeal or cortical enhancement may occur [^1162i8fp] but does not independently predict outcome.

---

## Clinical implications of MRI findings

MRI findings in PRES **directly inform care** by enabling rapid diagnosis [^111ExVPN] and prompt blood pressure control, seizure management [^113PZ1kx], and removal of triggers, thereby reducing the risk of permanent injury [^1172eSPE]. They also provide **prognostic value**, as extensive edema, diffusion restriction, or hemorrhage [^116XS6bG] predict worse outcomes, including permanent deficits, epilepsy, or death [^1172SVHP] [^113Tm2a3]. Serial MRI is used to **monitor resolution or progression**, guiding ongoing management [^114WAC5Z] and detecting **complications** [^113PZ1kx] [^111ExVPN].

---

## Clinical outcomes and complications

PRES is **usually reversible** with timely treatment, but complications can occur:

- **Seizures and status epilepticus**: Common [^113PZ1kx] and may require prolonged anticonvulsant therapy [^112oh27A].

- **Intracranial hemorrhage**: Occurs in ~15–20% [^111qAb5Y] and can cause permanent deficits or death [^1172SVHP] [^116XS6bG].

- **Ischemic stroke**: Diffusion restriction indicates higher infarction risk and worse outcomes [^113Tm2a3] [^1172SVHP] [^116XS6bG].

- **Permanent neurological deficits**: Persistent deficits or epilepsy occur in ~28% of cases, especially with delayed diagnosis or severe imaging findings [^112JdsMK] [^1172SVHP].

---

## Clinical management strategies

MRI findings **guide management**:

- **Blood pressure control**: Gradual reduction of elevated blood pressure [^1172eSPE] is critical to prevent further endothelial injury and edema [^113PZ1kx].

- **Seizure management**: Anticonvulsants [^112oh27A] are used to control seizures and prevent status epilepticus [^113PZ1kx].

- **Removal of precipitating factors**: Discontinuation or adjustment of causative medications (e.g. immunosuppressants, chemotherapy) [^111ExVPN] is essential [^113PZ1kx].

- **Supportive care**: Intensive care monitoring and supportive measures are often required, especially in severe cases [^112oh27A] [^113PZ1kx].

---

## Prognosis and long-term outcomes

PRES generally has a **favorable prognosis** with timely intervention [^111ExVPN], and most patients have clinical and radiological resolution within days to weeks [^113PZ1kx]. Recurrence is **infrequent** but can occur, particularly if precipitating factors are not adequately managed [^116QvyFH]. A minority develop **persistent neurological deficits** or epilepsy, especially with severe imaging findings or delayed treatment [^112JdsMK] [^1172SVHP].

---

MRI is **central to PRES** because it enables **early diagnosis**, risk stratification, and monitoring that directly inform management and prognosis [^111ExVPN] [^111rjzD9]. Recognizing typical and atypical MRI patterns ensures timely intervention and reduces the risk of permanent neurological injury [^114WAC5Z].

### Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome: A review with emphasis on neuroimaging characteristics [^111ExVPN]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2019). Low credibility.

Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) is a clinical and radiological condition characterized by the acute onset of headache, confusion, optical impairments, and seizures, accompanied by vasogenic edema on brain imaging. PRES is a complex disorder with many causative factors, including underlying conditions such as hypertensive encephalopathy, eclampsia, collagen disease, and severe infection.

Although the exact pathophysiological mechanism is not completely understood and remains controversial, the predominant proposed mechanism is endothelial dysfunction, often preceded by hypertension, immunosuppressive agents, or cytotoxic medication. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) facilitates prompt diagnosis and treatment, leading to good outcomes.

- **Neuroimaging findings**: Hyperintensity on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images and apparent diffusion coefficient mapping, and isointensity on diffusion-weighted images involving the parieto-occipital or posterior frontal cortical-subcortical regions recognized in over 90% of patients.
- **Reversibility of neuroimaging abnormalities**: Reversibility is the most important characteristic.

As an algorithm to standardize the diagnosis of PRES has not yet been developed, this review presents a diagnostic algorithm based on the types of MRI findings. This algorithm may provide a better understanding of PRES characteristics and bring us one step closer to the standardization of PRES diagnosis, helping clinicians evaluate individual features while also considering competing differential diagnoses.

### Imaging characteristics associated with clinical outcomes in posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome [^1172SVHP]. Neuroradiology (2017). Low credibility.

Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) is a disorder of cerebrovascular autoregulation that can result in brain edema, hemorrhage, and infarction. This study sought to investigate whether certain imaging characteristics in PRES are associated with clinically significant patient outcomes.

Methods were employed by retrospectively reviewing all cases of PRES occurring between 2008 and 2014 at two major academic medical centers. Demographic, clinical, and radiographic data were collected and analyzed. Imaging studies were assessed for vasogenic edema, hemorrhage, and diffusion restriction. Univariate analysis and stepwise logistic regression were performed to assess the association between radiologic findings and clinical outcomes, as defined by hospital discharge disposition and the modified Rankin scale (mRS) at the time of discharge.

In the results, 99 cases of PRES in 96 patients were identified. The median age was 55 years (IQR 30–65), and 74% of the patients were women. Among these cases, 60% of patients had active cancer, 19% had a history of bone marrow or organ transplantation, 14% had autoimmune disease, and 8% were peripartum. Imaging at clinical presentation showed extensive vasogenic edema in 39%, hemorrhage in 36%, hemorrhage with mass effect in 7%, and restricted diffusion in 16%. The final logistic regression models revealed that the presence of extensive vasogenic edema, hemorrhage with mass effect, or diffusion restriction was associated with worse clinical outcomes as defined by both discharge disposition (OR = 4.3; 95% CI: 1.4–36.3; p = 0.047) and mRS (OR = 3.6; 95% CI: 1.2–10.7; p = 0.019).

### Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome in intensive care medicine [^113PZ1kx]. Intensive Care Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) is a well-recognized clinico-neuroradiological transient condition. Early recognition is of paramount importance for prompt control of blood pressure or removal of precipitating factors and treatment of epileptic seizures or status epilepticus. Delay in the diagnosis and treatment may, in fact, result in death or irreversible neurological sequelae.

- **Discussion**: PRES is characterized by headache, altered mental status, seizures, and visual disturbances and is associated with a number of different causes, most commonly acute hypertension, preeclampsia/eclampsia, and immunosuppressive agents. Clinical symptoms and neuroradiological findings are typically indistinguishable among the cases of PRES, regardless of the underlying cause. Magnetic resonance studies typically show edema involving the white matter of cerebral posterior regions, especially the parieto-occipital lobes, but frontal and temporal lobes, and other encephalic structures may be involved.

- **Conclusions**: Intensivists and other physicians involved in the evaluation of patients with presumed PRES must be aware of the clinical spectrum of the associated conditions, the diagnostic modalities, and the correct treatment.

### Apparent diffusion coefficient reduction might be a predictor of poor outcome in patients with posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome [^113Tm2a3]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2017). Low credibility.

Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) is thought to be both clinically and radiologically reversible. However, its reversible nature has been challenged based on reports of permanent neurological impairments. The factors that predict the development of irreversible neurological impairment remain unclear. In the present study, we investigated clinical manifestations, laboratory findings, and neuroradiological images to identify predictors of functional outcomes in PRES.

We examined 23 patients with PRES. Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) reduction was observed in 4 patients in the poor outcome group, whereas no patients in the favorable outcome group presented ADC reduction (p < 0.01). Further studies are warranted to evaluate the association between ADC reduction and functional outcomes after PRES.

### Unusual presentation of PRES in the postnatal period [^116cQNh3]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Low credibility.

Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) is a clinicoradiological entity associated with a vast array of medical conditions and a variety of presenting symptoms. A characteristic pattern of radiographic features, alongside suggestive clinical manifestations, leads to a diagnosis of PRES.

This report describes the case of a 39-year-old, previously normotensive woman who presented on day 7 postpartum with generalized tonic-clonic seizures, reduced consciousness, and a history of blurred vision and headache. She was treated immediately as eclamptic and transferred to the intensive care unit for stabilization. Following an inconclusive CT result, an MRI was performed 2 days after presentation, demonstrating white matter changes consistent with those found in PRES. She made a full recovery, and a repeat MRI scan 7 weeks later showed no progression of the lesions noted on the original scan.

### Severe pre-eclamptic women with headache: Is posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome an associated concurrent finding [^114qkMNH]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2020). Low credibility.

Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) is an increasingly recognized condition associated with eclampsia, observed through radiological findings. It includes convulsion and a combination of conscious and visual disturbance, leading to abnormal neuroimaging findings. PRES is also known as acute hypertensive encephalopathy or reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy. Acute hypertension plays a major role in the imaging presentation of cortical changes on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which is completely different from those observed in patients with chronic hypertensive encephalopathy. However, limited neuroimaging information regarding severe pre-eclampsia is available. Headache-associated severe pre-eclampsia is an obstetrical emergency. More information on preventing deterioration into eclampsia can reduce both maternal and fetal mortality. However, no consistent protocol on whether a patient must undergo neuroimaging is available, which introduces a selection bias regarding the patients who are neuroimaged. Currently, a conservative approach is frequently adopted for severe pre-eclampsia due to the fear of the adverse effects of treatment and etiological investigations on the mother and unborn fetus. The present study aimed to detect early CNS changes, by magnetic resonance imaging, in women with severe pre-eclampsia having headaches. An attempt shall be made to elaborate on the known pathophysiological aspects for considering the observed changes.

### The innate immune response characterizes posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome [^112gtH1G]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2021). Low credibility.

While posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) is often characterized by an inflammatory cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) profile, knowledge of immune cell patterns in PRES is lacking. Thus, we retrospectively characterized CSF and peripheral blood (PB) from 15 PRES patients, which we analyzed by multidimensional flow cytometry (FC). Results were compared to 72 controls, as well as to 9 patients with progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML, as a relevant differential diagnosis) and 15 multiple sclerosis (MS) patients, as a classical neuroinflammatory disorder, respectively.

Total protein levels in CSF from PRES patients were elevated compared to that in controls, but not to MS and PML patients. In-depth FC analysis revealed no differences for adaptive immune cells (B cells, plasma cells, CD4+, and CD8+ T cells) in PB or CSF of PRES compared to controls. In contrast, we observed alterations of the adaptive immune response in CSF of PML and MS compared to PRES, indicating that the adaptive immune response is not a driver of disease in PRES.

Indeed, PRES was characterized by an innate immune response with CD14++/CD16+ (intermediate) monocytes elevated in PB and CSF, while CD14++/CD16- (classical) monocytes were decreased in PB from PRES patients compared to controls. Levels of CD14++/CD16+ monocytes correlated with the duration of hospital stay, serving as a surrogate marker for disease severity in PRES patients. Our findings argue for a role of innate, rather than adaptive, immunity in the pathophysiology of PRES. The observed shift in monocyte subsets might provide valuable insights into the disease mechanism.

### Severe and isolated headache associated with hypertension as unique clinical presentation of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome [^11611Ktk]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome is a potentially reversible clinicoradiologic syndrome characterized by headache, mental confusion, visual disturbances, and seizures, associated with posterior cerebral lesions on radiological imaging. Prompt treatment of this condition is mandatory to avoid severe irreversible complications.

- **Case presentation**: We report a 9-year-old boy with arterial hypertension and headache as the unique clinical presentation of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome.

- **Conclusions**: Severe and isolated headache associated with arterial hypertension can be the unique clinical presentation of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome. This syndrome must be considered even in the absence of all typical symptoms to prevent the progression of a potentially life-threatening condition.

### MRI characteristics of brain edema in preeclampsia/eclampsia patients with posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome [^111xPkLa]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2021). Low credibility.

The study protocol was approved by the institutional review board, and written informed consent has been waived given the retrospective nature of the study. A total of 150 women diagnosed with preeclampsia-eclampsia and undergoing cranial MRI from September 2012 to March 2020 were enrolled; 24 of these were diagnosed as having eclampsia.

The inclusion criteria were as follows:

- **Diagnosis criteria**: Preeclampsia was diagnosed according to the diagnostic criteria established by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, and eclampsia was defined by new-onset seizures that could not be attributed to other causative conditions in these women.
- **MRI timing**: Women with preeclampsia underwent cranial MRI within 3 days before or after the onset of symptoms such as headache, vomiting, visual disturbance, mental status changes, and consciousness impairment, while those with eclampsia underwent cranial MRI within 3 days before or after the onset of seizures.
- **Exclusion of other conditions**: Patients without neurological diseases such as epilepsy, brain tumors, and congenital brain malformations, which were unrelated to preeclampsia-eclampsia.

The exclusion criteria included:

- **Lack of PRES findings**: Patients that lacked clinicoradiologic findings of PRES.
- **Unrelated neuroimaging features**: Patients with abnormal neuroimaging features unrelated to PRES.

Finally, women who met these criteria were classified as having eclampsia with PRES (group E-PRES) and preeclampsia with PRES (group P-PRES).

### Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome [^116bUrCk]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2010). Low credibility.

Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome is a recently described clinicoradiological entity. Neuroimaging is very demonstrative and can be the first clue to the diagnosis. Common causes include hypertensive encephalopathy, immunosuppressive treatment, renal failure, and eclampsia. Its pathogenesis remains poorly understood. Clinical findings are not sufficiently specific; however, neuroimaging is often characteristic.

### Clinico-radiological correlations in posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome: Toward a better understanding of its heterogeneous manifestations [^112Gprhc]. Neuroradiology (2025). Low credibility.

Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES) is characterized by vasogenic brain edema, often triggered by hypertension or other known risk factors. Typical imaging shows bilateral parieto-occipital involvement, though rare cases affect deep brain structures. It is known that despite its definition, PRES includes a broad spectrum of radiological pictures, even if parieto-occipital location remains the most common. This study explored possible clinical characteristics and risk factors correlating with different radiological phenotypes, hypothesizing a consequent different pathogenesis.

- **Methods**: A retrospective analysis of 50 PRES patients (2010–2023) assessed demographics, clinical features, comorbidities, imaging findings, and outcomes. MRI scans were evaluated for lesion location, symmetry, hemispheric or deep (atypical), and infratentorial distribution.

- **Results**: Severe hypertension correlated with deep brain involvement (26%) compared to typical supratentorial forms (0.5%, p = 0.0500). Surgical patients were less likely to have deep region involvement (0.6% vs. 60%, p < 0.0001). Seizures were more common in typical PRES (90%) versus deep variants (66%, p = 0.0500). Autoimmune diseases were associated with hemorrhage [OR 8.5, p = 0.0153] and DWI restriction [OR 8.05, p = 0.0149]. A significant link was also found between DWI restriction and severe arterial hypertension [OR 6.66 (CI 95% 1.37–32.29), p = 0.0184]. DWI restriction and hemorrhage were linked to brain sequelae [OR 21 and OR 20.55, respectively, p = 0.0013–0.0014].

### MRI characteristics of brain edema in preeclampsia/eclampsia patients with posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome [^111vHXWX]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2021). Low credibility.

Eclampsia represents the most severe stage of the preeclampsia–eclampsia spectrum, with an incidence ranging from approximately 3/1000 to 9/1000 in pregnant or recently delivered women. Despite advancements in medical care and the increased prevalence of prenatal diagnostics in recent years, the global incidence and mortality rates associated with eclampsia remain high, posing significant risks to maternal and fetal lives. Consequently, the early prediction of eclampsia continues to be one of the formidable challenges faced in obstetrics.

Neuroimaging manifestations of eclampsia and preeclampsia often overlap, primarily presenting as posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES). PRES is a distinctive clinicoradiologic syndrome characterized by headaches, visual disturbances, and seizures with predominantly parieto-occipital vasogenic edema, occasionally accompanied by cytotoxic edema. To date, the precise pathophysiological mechanism underlying preeclampsia-eclampsia with PRES remains unclear and is a subject of ongoing debate. Limited information is available regarding differences in the extent and nature of brain edema between eclampsia and preeclampsia patients with PRES; furthermore, a definitive "threshold" trigger for the onset of eclampsia has yet to be identified.

Cranial conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the preferred imaging modality for preeclampsia-eclampsia patients with PRES. Gao et al. utilized conventional MRI sequences to assess the extent of brain edema in PRES patients and discovered a significant correlation between the edema score and serum levels of lactate dehydrogenase. Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) is another commonly used technique in these evaluations.

### Generalised reversible encephalopathy syndrome: a variant of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) [^111hNH7i]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Low credibility.

Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) is a clinical-radiological syndrome characterized by headache, visual disturbance, seizures, and altered consciousness. Radiological findings show hyperintense T2 lesions on MRI, predominantly located in the subcortical white matter of the posterior occipital and parietal lobes. We report the case of a 74-year-old woman with adenocarcinoma of the gastric cardia who developed severe neurological signs and symptoms. MRI of the brain showed atypical generalized hyperintense lesions on T2 and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery sequences. Under symptomatic treatment, the radiological changes as well as neurological signs and symptoms improved. Several potential risk factors for PRES, such as hypertensive crisis, blood transfusions, infection, and cancer, were identified in our patient, whereby perhaps the coexistence of these risk factors led to the unusual radiological and clinical manifestation of a generalized PRES variant.

### Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome in an HIV-infected patient on antiretroviral treatment: What is the risk factor [^116GHHGe]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES), also known as reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome, is a spontaneously resolving syndrome characterized by the radiographic finding of bilateral subcortical vasogenic edema. The vasogenic edema of the brain — predominantly involving the posterior parietal and occipital lobes — is caused by an autoregulatory dysfunction of brain vessels. This leads to arteriolar dilatation and hyperperfusion, together with hydrostatic leakage and interstitial fluid accumulation in the cortex and subcortical white matter. Frank infarction with cytotoxic edema is rarely described.

However, primary endothelial dysfunction may also lead to the release of inflammatory mediators with the weakening of the brain vessels' tight junctions, followed by edema. Many patients with PRES do not show typical risk factors such as hypertension, eclampsia, immunosuppression, or an inflammatory state. We present the rare case of a female HIV-infected patient with a long history of antiretroviral treatment (ART), an undetectable HIV viral load, and a high CD4 cell count. No classical risk factors for PRES were present. In contrast to the cases of HIV-infected patients with PRES published so far, our patient suffered neither from advanced immunodeficiency nor from opportunistic infection. However, it is conceivable that the impaired cerebrovascular reactivity, which persists even in treated and virally suppressed HIV-infected individuals, and the persistent immune activation in these patients, may represent an undetected risk factor for the development of PRES.

### Distinct imaging patterns and lesion distribution in posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome [^117Eiyq3]. AJNR: American Journal of Neuroradiology (2007). Low credibility.

Although the term posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) was popularized because of the typical presence of vasogenic edema in the parietal and occipital lobes, other regions of the brain are also frequently affected. We evaluated lesion distribution using CT and MR imaging in a large cohort of patients who experienced PRES to comprehensively assess the imaging patterns identified.

- **Materials and methods**: The locations of the PRES lesion at toxicity were comprehensively identified and tabulated in 136 patients by CT (22 patients) and MR (114 patients) imaging, including the hemispheric, basal ganglial, and infratentorial locations. Clinical associations, along with presentation at toxicity including blood pressure, were assessed.

- **Results**: Vasogenic edema was consistently present in the parietal or occipital regions (98%), but other locations were common including the frontal lobes (68%), inferior temporal lobes (40%), and cerebellar hemispheres (30%). Involvement of the basal ganglia (14%), brain stem (13%), and deep white matter (18%) including the splenium (10%) was not rare. Three major patterns of PRES were noted: the holohemispheric watershed (23%), superior frontal sulcal (27%), and dominant parietal-occipital (22%), with additional common partial or asymmetric expression of these primary PRES patterns (28%).

- **Conclusion**: Involvement of the frontal lobe, temporal lobe, and cerebellar hemispheres is common in PRES, along with the occasional presence of lesions in the brain stem, basal ganglia, deep white matter, and splenium. Three primary PRES patterns were identified in this study.

### Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome in an HIV-infected patient on antiretroviral treatment: What is the risk factor [^111TiJ6v]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) is a rare but well-described syndrome associated with high morbidity and substantial mortality. We present an illustrative case of an HIV-infected but virologically suppressed patient who complained of visual impairment accompanied by severe headache and epileptic seizures. The cerebral CT scan and the follow-up cranial MRI confirmed the diagnosis of PRES. Unlike previously published cases of HIV-infected patients with PRES, our patient did not suffer from advanced immunodeficiency, opportunistic infection, or any other evident predisposing factor. This case highlights that the absence of classical risk factors does not exclude the diagnosis of PRES. We discuss the hypothesis that, in accordance with the new pathophysiological theory, persistent HIV-associated cerebrovascular reactivity combined with endothelial dysfunction may represent an undetected risk factor for the development of PRES in virologically and immunologically stable patients.

### Case report: Blood-transfusion induced posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome [^113wYWwn]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) is an increasingly recognized clinical entity associated with a variety of medical conditions. It is commonly considered in the presentation of uncontrolled, severe hypertension. However, more recently, it has been described in the setting of blood transfusion, particularly in those with chronic anemia, even in the absence of severe hypertension. We describe a patient who presented to the emergency department 12 days following a large blood transfusion for severe, chronic anemia with headache, vision loss, expressive aphasia, and a change in mental status, with only mild blood pressure elevation, who was ultimately diagnosed with PRES and refractory non-convulsive status epilepticus. Emergency physicians are often the first to initiate blood transfusion for those with low hemoglobin. Therefore, it is prudent to proceed with caution in transfusing those with chronic anemia. It is also important for the emergency physician to keep PRES on the differential for those presenting with a neurologic complaint after correction of their chronic anemia, even in the absence of severe hypertension.

### Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome: A comparative study of pediatric versus adult patients [^113hhxso]. Pediatric Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) is an acute neurotoxic syndrome that, although characteristically reversible, can result in long-term disability. Our aim was to identify the clinical and radiological factors that are unique to children with PRES compared with adults with the syndrome in a single center.

- **Methods**: We retrospectively reviewed the clinical and radiological records of all patients with PRES admitted at a tertiary care medical center from 2007 to 2014. Patients who met the clinical and radiological criteria for PRES were categorized into children (under 18 years) and adults (18 years or older), and a comparison of their baseline variables, clinical, laboratory, and imaging features was performed.

- **Results**: During this study period, 19 pediatric patients and 100 adult patients with PRES were identified. On univariate analysis, factors significantly associated with pediatric patients were multiorgan failure (84.2% vs. 50%, P = 0.006), temporal lobe involvement (63.3% vs. 39%, P = 0.04), restricted diffusion (42.1% vs. 18%, P = 0.02), and a lower likelihood of cerebellar involvement (21.1% vs. 57%, P = 0.004). On bivariate logistic regression analysis, all these factors remained significantly associated with pediatric PRES: multiorgan failure (odds ratio: 5.80, 95% confidence interval: 1.45 to 29.41, P = 0.03), temporal lobe involvement (odds ratio: 5.08, 95% confidence interval: 1.17 to 22.17, P = 0.03), and restricted diffusion (odds ratio: 2.48, 95% confidence interval: 1.61 to 10.10).

### Neurological presentations in sickle cell patients are not always stroke: A review of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome in sickle cell disease [^117RVyxa]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2016). Low credibility.

Acute neurological changes in sickle cell disease (SCD) patients often raise suspicion for stroke. Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) can mimic stroke in its clinical presentation. We aimed to review the PRES literature in SCD patients, including clinical presentation, risk factors, pathophysiology, and management, and to elucidate the distinction between PRES and stroke in SCD. The exact pathophysiology of PRES in SCD remains elusive but is likely multifactorial and related to sickling, ischemia, and chronic anemia predisposing to vasogenic edema. PRES and stroke in SCD are distinguishable conditions. Our review may help elucidate a clinical approach to this distinction.

### Misdiagnosis of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome and reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome in the emergency department [^111rjzD9]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). High credibility.

Patients presenting with symptoms of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) and reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome (RCVS) can often be misdiagnosed in the emergency department due to similarities in clinical presentation. Proper awareness and a high index of suspicion are crucial for correctly identifying these conditions to ensure appropriate treatment and management. Failure to accurately diagnose these syndromes can result in inadequate care and potential adverse outcomes for patients. The identification relies heavily on recognizing characteristic features on imaging studies in conjunction with clinical clues. Increasing awareness among clinicians regarding the presentation and progression of these conditions could significantly improve patient outcomes.

### Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome in end-stage kidney disease: not strictly posterior or reversible [^1149dyFe]. American Journal of Nephrology (2015). Low credibility.

Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) is an uncommon clinico-radiological condition that can result in severe brain injury. The pathogenesis of cerebral vasogenic edema, the hallmark of PRES, is not fully understood. Despite its name, there is substantial heterogeneity both in terms of imaging findings and outcomes. Relatively little is known about PRES in kidney disease despite the clustering of risk factors, including hypertension, autoimmune disease, and immunosuppression.

In a retrospective observational study of incident end-stage kidney disease patients in Southwest Ireland over a ten-year period, we discovered five cases of PRES, representing an incidence of 0.84% in this patient population. These five cases highlight the variability in clinical presentation and the potentially life-threatening nature of this condition. We provide an in-depth review of the existing literature regarding PRES in terms of its pathogenesis and heterogeneity, as well as the experience of PRES in end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) patients.

PRES appears to be rare in the ESKD population but could be under-recognized. Marked hypertension is a cardinal risk factor in this population, associated with extracellular fluid volume expansion. Neuroimaging findings can be diverse, involving both anterior and posterior circulation territories. Three of the five patients described had commenced haemodialysis within four weeks of their presentation. These patients may be particularly vulnerable to microvascular brain injury, which can be devastating. This emphasizes the need for clinicians to pay meticulous attention.

### Delayed CSF enhancement in posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome [^112bU3jr]. AJNR. American Journal of Neuroradiology (2008). Low credibility.

We present a case of increased fluid-attenuated inversion recovery signal intensity in the subarachnoid spaces on 6-hour delayed enhanced MR imaging in a patient with posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) in the setting of acute hypertensive encephalopathy. This hyperintensity was believed to be due to CSF gadolinium enhancement, a finding that would be anticipated in light of the suspected pathogenesis of increased microvascular permeability in PRES.

### Transient reduction in venous susceptibility during posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome [^116o8PQt]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2015). Low credibility.

We report a case of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) in which follow-up MRI demonstrated a transient reduction in venous signal on initial SWAN images. The progressive normalization of venous signal on D10 and D40 imaging paralleled the progressive decrease of hyperperfusion on CBF images. Decreased venous susceptibility has never been reported in PRES; it is most likely related to a transient BOLD effect induced by brain hyperperfusion.

### Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome: Incidence and associated factors in a pediatric critical care population [^116YsyHg]. Pediatric Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome may occur frequently and be underrecognized in children and young adults admitted to a pediatric critical care unit.

- **Methods**: Patients under 21 years of age diagnosed with posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome were reviewed in this retrospective cohort study conducted over a 30-month period.

- **Results**: There were 2,588 admissions to the pediatric critical care unit, 226 neurology service consultations, and 10 patients diagnosed with posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (incidence of 1 in 259 pediatric critical care unit admissions, 0.4%). The majority of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome patients (9 out of 10) presented with generalized tonic and/or clonic seizures. Apart from hypertension and cytotoxic medication use, anemia — a previously unreported risk factor — was found in all 10 patients (100%) with posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome. A one-year follow-up available for eight patients showed no residual neurological deficits attributable to posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome, with significant resolution of white matter signal abnormalities on neuroimaging.

- **Conclusion**: Our case cohort includes an estimation of the incidence of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome in children and young adults, with a 1-year follow-up and anemia as a potential previously unreported risk factor.

### Widening the spectrum of PRES: Series from a tertiary care center [^1111PsNb]. European Journal of Radiology (2007). Low credibility.

Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) is defined as a neurologic disorder characterized by distinct radiologic findings, typically showing lesions in the subcortical white matter at the posterior circulation territory. Several authors have suggested alternative descriptive terms for this syndrome as atypical radiologic features are being described more frequently. In this retrospective study, we aimed to determine the frequency and features of radiologic findings in the setting of a tertiary care center. Our observations indicated that some patients had simultaneous multiple conditions, previously shown to independently cause PRES in the literature. These probable predisposing factors were also revisited.

### Detecting the uncommon imaging manifestations of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) in adults: A comprehensive illustrated guide for the trainee radiologist [^113VQxK3]. Current Problems in Diagnostic Radiology (2020). Low credibility.

Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) has traditionally been described as a reversible leukoencephalopathy with a distinct pattern of posteriorly distributed vasogenic edema involving the subcortical regions of the parietal and occipital lobes. PRES commonly occurs in the setting of hypertensive emergencies, pre-eclampsia/eclampsia, impaired renal function, and immunosuppressive therapy. The various clinical presentations of PRES include encephalopathy, seizures, headache, and visual and focal neurological deficits. As knowledge of this entity grows, the range of clinical and radiological features is seen to be much broader than originally described. The brain edema may not always be posteriorly distributed, and the syndrome may not be uniformly reversible. Of special note are some uncommon imaging features such as unilateral cerebral involvement and isolated posterior fossa involvement, as well as uncommon complications like hemorrhage, cytotoxic edema, and vasoconstriction. These red herrings may lead to potential diagnostic challenges and pitfalls, especially for trainee radiologists, who often read these scans in an emergency setting. Early and accurate diagnosis is crucial for prompt and optimum management, thereby avoiding residual morbidity. This review article focuses on the atypical radiological features of PRES in adults, with extensive case-based imaging examples. A brief description of the pathophysiology, clinical, and classic radiological features of PRES has also been included. A tabulated summary of potential mimics with diagnostic pearls is provided to highlight the complexities of diagnosing this condition.

### Magnetic resonance imaging of arterial stroke mimics: A pictorial review [^116NHgW2]. Insights into Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) is a clinico-radiological syndrome characterized by a variable combination of impaired consciousness, seizure activity, headaches, visual abnormalities, nausea/vomiting, and focal neurological signs. Prompt diagnosis and the empirical modification of all identifiable risk factors are crucial determinants of patient outcomes. The causes are numerous, the most common being hypertension, eclampsia, and the use of immunosuppressants. The mechanism of PRES is not known. Two opposing hypotheses are commonly cited:

1. The older theory suggests that severe hypertension exceeds the limits of autoregulation, resulting in brain edema.
2. The more recent theory suggests that systemic toxicity leads to endothelial dysfunction with subsequent vasoconstriction or leukocyte trafficking, or both.

PRES lesions affect the cortex and subcortical white matter, are hyperintense on T2 and FLAIR, and have a predilection for posterior regions with a suggestive symmetric distribution (Fig. 7). Focal areas of vasogenic edema may also be seen in the brain stem, the basal ganglia, and deep white matter (external/internal capsule). However, focal areas of cytotoxic edema with restricted diffusion can be seen, and mixed patterns on DWI are not uncommon; cytotoxic edema may be associated with a poor outcome. T2-GRE or SWI can detect subarachnoid hemorrhaging at the convexity or intraparenchymal hematoma. Contrast-enhanced T1-WI can show enhancement of lesions, which is seen more commonly in children than in adults. TOF-MRA may show features that indicate further complications.

### Neuroimaging features in posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome: A pictorial review [^114WAC5Z]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2017). Low credibility.

Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) is a radioclinical entity associated with nonspecific neurological symptoms, such as headache, seizures, impairment of alertness, and visual disturbances, occurring in evocative clinical conditions, including hypertension, eclampsia, use of immunosuppressor agents, and systemic lupus erythematosus. In the acute stage, the typical imaging finding is vasogenic edema predominantly affecting the subcortical parietal-occipital white matter. This pictorial review aims to illustrate the various neuroimaging features of PRES and present key radiological elements crucial for diagnosis.

- **Distributions of vasogenic edema**: We examine the distribution of vasogenic edema and its relevance in diagnosis.
- **Hemorrhage**: The presence and impact of hemorrhage are analyzed.
- **Diffusion and perfusion patterns**: We explore the variations in diffusion and perfusion patterns observed in PRES cases.
- **Enhancement types encountered**: Different types of enhancement are discussed, along with their implications.
- **Vascular modifications demonstrated by angiography**: Angiographic evidence of vascular changes is presented to provide insight into PRES pathophysiology.

The cause of PRES remains unknown. However, catheter angiography, MR angiography, and MR perfusion features provide further understanding of its pathophysiology. Follow-up imaging typically shows radiologic improvement in the vast majority of cases within 1 to 2 weeks and sometimes up to 1 month. Recurrent PRES attacks are uncommon, and atypical imaging presentations should not exclude the diagnosis of PRES in a compatible clinical situation.

### Controversy of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome: What have we learnt in the last 20 years [^112W8VBh]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

Over the past two decades since posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) was first described in 1996, it has become increasingly recognized due to improved and more readily available imaging modalities. The exact pathophysiological mechanism of PRES is not completely understood and remains controversial. Precise diagnosis is essential to guide prompt and proper management. Our ability to differentiate it from other acute neurological disorders is likely to improve as we learn more about the spectrum of this entity over the last 20 years. Recognizing its diagnostic criteria and biomarkers is crucial for outcome evaluation and study design. PRES generally has a favorable prognosis, but neurological sequelae and fatalities can occur, especially in severe forms that might cause substantial morbidity and mortality, particularly when complicated by intracranial hemorrhage or brain infarction. This review describes the pathophysiology, diagnostic approaches, controversies regarding prognosis, and future research directions of PRES.

### Catheter angiography, MR angiography, and MR perfusion in posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome [^114JLAmf]. AJNR. American Journal of Neuroradiology (2008). Low credibility.

The cause of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) is unknown. Two primary hypotheses exist: 1) hypertension exceeding auto-regulatory limits leading to forced hyper-perfusion and 2) vasoconstriction and hypo-perfusion leading to ischemia with resultant edema. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the catheter angiography (CA), MR angiography (MRA), and MR perfusion (MRP) features in PRES in order to render further insight into its mechanism of origin.

- **Materials and methods**: In 47 patients with PRES, 9 CAs and 43 MRAs were evaluated for evidence of vasculopathy (vasoconstriction and vasodilation), and 15 MRP studies were evaluated for altered relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) in PRES lesions and regions. Visualization of vessels on MRA and toxicity blood pressures were compared with the extent of hemispheric vasogenic edema.

- **Results**: Vasculopathy was present in 8 of 9 patients on CA (direct correlation to MRA in 3/6 patients). At MRA, moderate to severe vessel irregularity consistent with vasoconstriction and vasodilation was present in 30 of 43 patients, and vessel pruning or irregularity in 7 patients, with follow-up MRA demonstrating reversal of vasoconstriction or vasodilation in 9 of 11 patients. Vasogenic edema was less in patients with hypertension compared with patients who were normotensive. Preserved normal length of the posterior cerebral artery (PCA) was commonly seen in patients with severe hypertension despite diffuse or focal vasoconstriction or vasodilation.

### Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome due to severe hypercalcemia [^1117QQnZ]. Journal of Neurology (2002). Low credibility.

Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) is a leukoencephalopathy characterized by headache, altered mental status, visual loss, and seizures. Neuroimaging demonstrates symmetrical posterior cortical and subcortical lesions. The exact pathophysiology is unknown, but there is a strong association with immunosuppressants and hypertension. We report two cases of PRES in normotensive patients with severe hypercalcemia as the only identifiable cause. Possible pathophysiological mechanisms are discussed.

### Imaging findings in neonatal and pediatric posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) differ from adults [^115ejpuY]. Pediatric Neurology (2022). Low credibility.

Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) is classically a reversible clinical radiographic syndrome associated with predominantly posterior leukoencephalopathy on neuroimaging. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in adults demonstrates almost universally reversible parietal-occipital disease. We aimed to demonstrate in a cohort of children that "atypical" distribution is expected, acutely and on follow-up.

- **Methods**: A retrospective review of children diagnosed with PRES from 2010 to 2018 at our children's hospital was performed. All had MRI at diagnosis, with over half having follow-up MRIs. Images were reviewed by a neuroradiology-trained pediatric radiologist for confirmation of findings consistent with PRES and identification of involved regions.

- **Results**: Nineteen patients (aged zero to 18 years, 53% female) were included. Notably, two were infants. Nearly all had seizures; all had altered mental status and hypertension. Fifteen (84%) had MRI described as "atypical". The distribution of MRI findings was anatomically widespread, including nine with frontal findings. Twelve (63%) had follow-up imaging, of which approximately half remained abnormal.

- **Conclusions**: Pediatric PRES MRI findings were more often atypical at the time of diagnosis. Vasogenic edema related to the acute phases of PRES typically resolved; however, follow-up imaging identified new volume loss in the areas affected. Two of our subjects were younger than 13 months, younger than typically described. Our series demonstrates that imaging distribution in children with PRES does not mirror the classic presentation observed in adults.

### Arterial blood pressure but not serum albumin concentration correlates with ADC ratio values in pediatric posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome [^115BC77g]. Neuroradiology (2015). Low credibility.

Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) is a clinical-radiological entity affecting both adults and children, characterized by neurotoxicity often occurring in the setting of hypertension coupled with distinct brain magnetic resonance imaging features. Decreased serum albumin level has been suggested to correlate with the presence of vasogenic brain edema in adult PRES. Serum albumin has thus been hypothesized to protect against neurotoxicity in PRES by reducing vasogenic brain edema through its role in maintaining plasma osmotic pressure and endothelial integrity. The purpose of our study was to investigate if such a correlation between decreased serum albumin level and PRES-related vasogenic edema could be found in children.

- **Methods**: We conducted a retrospective study of 25 pediatric patients diagnosed with PRES. Underlying clinical conditions, presenting symptoms, blood pressures, and serum albumin levels at the onset of symptoms were collected. Brain MR imaging studies were reviewed. We used a quantitative method to evaluate the degree of vasogenic edema by measuring apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values of the T2-FLAIR hyperintense brain lesions.

- **Results**: No significant correlation was found between serum albumin level and the degree of PRES-related vasogenic edema. A significant correlation was found between elevated blood pressure and the degree of vasogenic edema in the temporal lobes (p = 0.02 and 0.04, respectively) but not in the other cerebral lobes or cerebellum.

- **Conclusions**: Our initial results suggest blood pressure, not serum albumin level, as a main bio.

### MRI characteristics of brain edema in preeclampsia/eclampsia patients with posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome [^112kvkbW]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2021). Low credibility.

What triggers the occurrence of eclampsia in preeclampsia patients with PRES is still unknown. This retrospective study suggests that certain MRI characteristics reflecting the extent and nature of brain edema differ in eclampsia and preeclampsia patients with PRES. However, additional prospective studies are required to explore whether these MRI characteristics of brain edema may become potential predictors for eclamptic seizures in preeclampsia patients with PRES. Given the high mortality related to intracranial complications in eclampsia patients, early consideration of cranial MRI in the management of preeclampsia patients is recommended to evaluate the presence or absence of PRES, as well as the extent and nature of brain edema.

### Comparison of clinical manifestations, laboratory, neuroimaging findings, and outcomes in children with posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) in children with and without renal disease [^113xWyrh]. Pediatric Neurology (2022). Low credibility.

To demonstrate and compare the clinical manifestations, laboratory findings, and neuroimaging findings of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) in children with and without underlying renal disease, a study was conducted.

- **Methods**: The study included 23 children diagnosed with PRES from January 2009 to March 2019. All data, including clinical manifestations, laboratory findings, underlying medical illness, and neuroimaging results, were obtained.

- **Results**:
	- Sixteen had underlying renal disease. The median age of PRES onset was 10.3 years in children with renal disease and 9.8 years in children without renal disease.
	- Higher blood pressure at the baseline, on admission, and at the onset of PRES was found more in the renal disease group than in the nonrenal disease group (P < 0.05).
	- Seizures were likely seen in the renal disease group compared with the nonrenal disease group (P = 0.03). Generalized tonic-clonic seizures were the most common seizure type in both groups.
	- An initial CT scan revealed vasogenic edema in 75% of the renal group and 85.7% of the nonrenal group. During a long-term follow-up, all children recovered without significant neurological deficits or subsequent epilepsy.

- **Conclusions**: Hypertension and higher baseline blood pressure are more common in children with renal disease who develop PRES compared with nonrenal disease. Seizures are more common in the renal disease group. A computed tomographic (CT) scan can help with PRES diagnosis when magnetic resonance imaging is not available. All children with PRES recovered without significant neurological deficits.

### Severe and isolated headache associated with hypertension as unique clinical presentation of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome [^117Ku7Jr]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome has often been reported in pediatric cases associated with hypertension due to renal diseases or steroid treatment. Symptoms usually include seizures, mental status changes, visual alterations, headache, and vomiting.

The literature describes posterior regions of the brain being frequently involved, but concomitant anterior lesions are often detected. Brain stem, basal ganglia, deep white matter, or splenium of the corpus callosum lesions are also described in less than one third of the patients. The pathophysiology of this syndrome is not fully understood but appears to be multifactorial. The underlying mechanism could be a brain capillary leak syndrome following hypertension, fluid retention, or the cytotoxic effects of immunosuppressive agents on the vascular endothelium. A sudden rise in blood pressure is probably the most common cause, as it can induce disruption of cerebral vascular autoregulation, mostly in the posterior cerebral vasculature, causing leakage of fluid into the brain parenchyma. Indeed, a gradual blood pressure control is recommended to avoid cerebral hypoperfusion and increased morbidity.

Moreover, this syndrome can be irreversible or even fatal if appropriate treatment is not started promptly.

### Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome: Prognostic utility of quantitative diffusion-weighted MR images [^113xMSMa]. AJNR. American Journal of Neuroradiology (2002). Low credibility.

The recently described posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) classically consists of reversible vasogenic edema in the posterior circulation territories, although conversion to irreversible cytotoxic edema has been described. We hypothesized that the extent of edema has prognostic implications and that diffusion-weighted MR imaging (DWI) can help predict the progression to infarction.

- **Methods**: Twenty-two patients with PRES and 18 control subjects were examined with isotropic DWI. Nineteen regions of interest (ROIs) were systematically placed, and apparent diffusion coefficients (ADCs) were computed and correlated with T2 and DWI signal intensity in each ROI.

- **Results**: T2 signal abnormalities were always present in territories of the posterior circulation. Anterior circulation structures were involved in 91% of patients. ADC values in areas of abnormal T2 signal were high. More extensive T2 signal abnormalities were seen in patients with a poor outcome than in patients who recovered. In six patients (27%), areas of high DWI signal intensity were seen with ADC values that were paradoxically normal, which we called pseudonormalized. Abnormal T2 signal intensity and high ADC values surrounded these areas. Follow-up images in two patients showed progression to infarction in pseudonormalized regions.

- **Conclusion**: Vasogenic edema in PRES involves predominantly the posterior circulation territories, but anterior circulation structures are also frequently involved. The extent of combined T2 and DWI signal abnormalities correlates with patient outcomes.

### A pediatric case of reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome with similar radiographic findings to posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome [^1144XKVa]. Pediatric Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

Reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome occurs predominantly in middle-aged women. Only nine pediatric patients with this syndrome have been reported.

- **Patient description**: We present a ten-year-old boy with reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome with radiographic findings similar to those of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES). He presented with a thunderclap headache without a neurological deficit. Brain magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) revealed multifocal narrowing of the cerebral arteries, whereas magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with diffusion-weighted imaging and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery demonstrated hyperintense lesions in the occipital lobes and the left cerebellum. The patient's symptoms resolved spontaneously following a few hours with no recurrence. MRA on the second day showed a complete normalization of the affected arteries, and MRI after one month demonstrated improvement in the abnormal findings, leading to a diagnosis of RCVS with radiographic findings similar to those of PRES.

- **Conclusions**: This child's findings suggest that RCVS, with or without PRES, may occur in children who present with a thunderclap headache.

### Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome: Long-term follow-up [^116QvyFH]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2010). Low credibility.

Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) has been known for more than 10 years; however, the long-term prognosis of this condition remains unknown.

- **Patients and methods**: In 2006, the authors retrospectively screened the medical records of their department from 1993 to 2006 for PRES. They identified 13 patients. Since 2006, another 12 patients have been included prospectively. Follow-up has been conducted yearly for all patients, who were investigated in the outpatient clinic or, if they declined to attend, were interviewed by telephone.

- **Results**: The authors identified 25 patients with 27 episodes of PRES. Eighty-four percent of the patients had generalized seizures. Their mean blood pressure was 167/100 mm Hg. Follow-up was performed for all patients over a mean period of 2250 days (range 59–9396; median 1699). Symptoms resolved, on average, after 7.5 days. Restitution of imaging abnormalities was shown in 72% of cases. All others exhibited a clear improvement, but without complete restitution, following a mean duration of 41 days. Recurrence of PRES was observed in two patients (8%) three years after complete recovery from their first episode.

- **Conclusion**: These data show that PRES has a good short-term and long-term prognosis. Recurrence is infrequent, even though trigger factors for PRES were repeatedly experienced by the patients. Resolution of MRI lesions is slower than clinical recovery.

### PRES: Review of histological features [^1139JddG]. Journal of Neuropathology and Experimental Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome was described in 1996 as a clinical-neuroimaging entity characterized by parieto-occipital watershed-region edema without overt infarction. It has been linked to hypertension, eclampsia, immunosuppressive therapies, infections, and autoimmune disorders. The condition usually has an acute onset, presents with seizures, and ameliorates within days. There have been few neuropathological studies, but in some cases, tissue damage may be more permanent.

### Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome caused by hypertensive encephalopathy and acute uremia [^113JUCWc]. Neurocritical Care (2006). Low credibility.

The posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) is a recently proposed cliniconeuroradiological entity. The most common causes of PRES are hypertensive encephalopathy, eclampsia, cyclosporin A neurotoxicity, and uremic encephalopathy. On magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies, edema has been reported in a relatively symmetrical pattern, typically in the subcortical white matter and occasionally in the cortex of the posterior circulation area of the cerebrum.

- **Methods and results**: A 19-year-old woman undergoing chronic hemodialysis was admitted with encephalopathy. High signal intensity was seen bilaterally in the subcortical and deep white matter areas of the temporal, frontal, parietal, and occipital lobes on cranial MRI.

- **Conclusion**: Particular attention needs to be given to PRES because initiation of appropriate intervention can reverse the encephalopathic condition in most cases. Cerebral lesions may be more prominent in the anterior circulation area in some patients.

### Tumour-like presentation of atypical posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome with prominent brainstem involvement [^111EUVVY]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). Low credibility.

Typical posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) is a clinical-neuroradiological entity characterized by bilateral white matter edema, which is usually symmetrical and totally reversible in 2–3 weeks. A 46-year-old man presented with a persistent headache and visual blurring in the right eye. On admission, the clinical examination revealed minimal unsteadiness of gait and elevated blood pressure. A brain MRI showed a hyperintense signal on T2-weighted sequences in the whole brainstem, extending to the spinal cord (C2-C6), the left insula, and the right cerebellum. When his blood pressure was controlled, his symptoms gradually improved. A follow-up MRI scan at 3 weeks revealed a dramatic regression of the hyperintense lesions on T2-weighted sequences.

The differential diagnosis of PRES is very wide, especially in cases of conspicuous brainstem involvement. Treatable causes of white matter edema should always be kept in mind to avoid misdiagnosis and prevent complications, such as intracranial hemorrhage.

### Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome and reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome in patients with COVID-19 infection: Is there a link? A systematic review and case report analysis [^115yuo76]. Journal of Neurology (2023). Low credibility.

During the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, several cases of Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES) and Reversible Cerebral Vasoconstriction Syndrome (RCVS) in COVID-19 patients have been reported, but the link between these syndromes and COVID-19 is unclear. We performed a systematic review according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement to evaluate whether SARS-CoV-2 infection or the drugs used to treat it could be deemed potential risk factors for PRES or RCVS.

We conducted a literature search and found 70 articles (60 on PRES and 10 on RCVS) concerning 105 patients (85 with PRES and 20 with RCVS). We analyzed the clinical characteristics of the two populations separately and then performed an inferential analysis to search for other independent risk factors. We found fewer than usual PRES-related (43.9%) and RCVS-related (45%) risk factors in patients with COVID-19. Such a low incidence of risk factors for PRES and RCVS might suggest the involvement of COVID-19 as an additional risk factor for both diseases due to its capability to cause endothelial dysfunction. We discuss the putative mechanisms of endothelial damage by SARS-CoV-2 and antiviral drugs, which may underlie the development of PRES and RCVS.

Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) is a clinicoradiologic disorder characterized by seizures, headache, altered mental status, and visual disturbances, and is often associated with acute hypertension.

- **Objective**: This narrative review provides a focused description of the presentation, diagnostic evaluation, and management of PRES.

- **Discussion**: PRES is associated with a variety of factors, including acute rise in blood pressure, renal disease, preeclampsia/eclampsia, and immunosuppressive therapy. The pathophysiology is theorized to involve dysfunction of cerebral autoregulation leading to vascular leak or endothelial dysfunction resulting in vasogenic edema. In the emergency department (ED), clinical findings suggestive of PRES should prompt diagnostic testing focused on confirming the diagnosis and excluding other conditions that may present similarly. Laboratory studies are primarily useful for excluding alternative diagnoses. Computed tomography (CT), and, in particular, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), are the recommended neuroimaging modalities for diagnosis. CT and MRI may demonstrate cerebral vasogenic edema, most often in the distribution of the posterior circulation. Treatment involves management of seizures, control of blood pressure if elevated, and treatment of any underlying trigger.

- **Conclusion**: PRES is a neurological disorder that is typically reversible if recognized on presentation and promptly and appropriately managed. This narrative review characterizes this condition for emergency clinicians.

### Neuroimaging findings of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) following haematopoietic stem cell transplantation in paediatric recipients [^114WXLK7]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Low credibility.

Paediatric HSCT recipients presenting with CNS signs and symptoms should be evaluated by neuroimaging studies for timely diagnosis and early management. PRES is the most common CNS complication and usually presents with typical clinical and imaging findings. However, atypical MRI manifestations may appear, which should not dissuade a PRES diagnosis in appropriate clinical settings with exclusion of other possibilities. Diffusion restriction is an important imaging finding that can be associated with residual changes and should be assessed in all MRI studies for these patients.

- **Main points**:
	- Paediatric HSCT recipients presenting with CNS signs and symptoms should be evaluated by neuroimaging studies.
	- Variable neuroimaging presentations should not dissuade a PRES diagnosis in appropriate clinical settings following allogeneic HSCT in paediatric recipients.
	- In PRES, lower ADC values are associated with a poor prognosis, and normal ADC values in association with increased signal intensity on DWI should also be evaluated in terms of ADC pseudonormalization.

### Utility and significance of gadolinium-based contrast enhancement in posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome [^1162i8fp]. AJNR. American Journal of Neuroradiology (2016). Low credibility.

Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome is a clinicoradiologic syndrome. Literature regarding associated factors and the prognostic significance of contrast enhancement in posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome is sparse. This study set out to evaluate an association between the presence of enhancement in posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome and various clinical factors in a large series of patients with this syndrome.

- **Materials and methods**: From an MR imaging report search that yielded 176 patients with clinically confirmed posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome between 1997 and 2014, we identified 135 patients who had received gadolinium-based contrast. The presenting symptoms, etiology, clinical follow-up, and maximum systolic and diastolic blood pressures within 1 day of MR imaging were recorded. MRIs were reviewed for parenchymal hemorrhage, MR imaging severity, and the presence and pattern of contrast enhancement. Statistical analyses evaluated a correlation between any clinical features and the presence or pattern of enhancement.

- **Results**: Of 135 included patients (67.4% females; age range, 7–82 years), 59 (43.7%) had contrast enhancement on T1-weighted MR imaging, the most common pattern being leptomeningeal (n = 24, 17.8%) or leptomeningeal plus cortical (n = 21, 15.6%). Clinical outcomes were available in 96 patients. No significant association was found between the presence or pattern of enhancement and any of the variables, including sex, age, symptom, MR imaging severity, blood pressure, or outcome (all P > .05).

### Rare posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome in a patient with HIV [^116MGwna]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Low credibility.

Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) is an uncommon neurological disorder characterized by the rapid onset of neurological deficits and characteristic neuroimaging findings, such as cerebral edema with a typical preference for the posterior white matter. We report a case of a 59-year-old woman with untreated HIV infection and hypertension who received a PRES diagnosis, with rare involvement of the basal ganglia and brainstem, along with microhemorrhages. HIV infection, particularly if untreated, is associated with an inflammatory status and therefore endothelial damage and dysfunction, which might play an important role in predisposing individuals to acute hypertensive crises and PRES.

### Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome [^112oh27A]. Journal of Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) is a neurological disorder characterized by a range of neurological signs and symptoms and distinctive neuroimaging findings reflecting vasogenic edema. Both clinical and imaging characteristics are usually reversible. On average, about 40% of all patients diagnosed with PRES require intensive care monitoring and treatment due to severe complications such as status epilepticus, cerebral ischemia, intracerebral hemorrhage, or intracranial hypertension.

The syndrome was first described in 1996 by Hinchey and colleagues, who reported on a series of 15 patients with neurological signs and symptoms, including headache, seizures, visual disturbance, and other focal neurological deficits. Moreover, computed tomographic (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) alterations suggestive of cerebral edema were observed predominantly in the posterior regions. Since this first description of PRES, numerous case reports and case series, as well as retrospective observational studies describing the syndrome, have been published. Importantly, no randomized controlled studies have been performed, a fact that has to be taken into account when discussing epidemiological data, diagnostic criteria, and treatment recommendations.

Epidemiological data, in particular, should be interpreted with caution since the syndrome may still be significantly underdiagnosed, as the condition can be hard to confirm. PRES has been reported in almost all age groups, from children to older adults, but most frequently in young- or middle-aged adults.

### The innate immune response characterizes posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome [^1169DTw1]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2021). Low credibility.

The underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) remain insufficiently understood, and diagnostic certainty is limited by the heterogeneous presentation and dependence on coinciding clinico-radiological findings. Succinctly, our manuscript provides corroboration of previous studies reporting elevated protein levels in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of PRES patients and evidence for the association of PRES with the monocyte composition shifting towards the intermediate subset (CD14 ++/ CD16 +). Additionally, in-depth flow cytometry (FC) analysis reveals no changes to cells of the adaptive immune system, such as T cells, B cells, or plasma cells in PRES. Together, as the first in-depth immune cell pattern analysis of PRES, our data argues for a role of innate rather than adaptive immunity in the pathophysiology of PRES.

Reflecting previous reports, we observed female predominance and advanced age among PRES patients. Moreover, our cohort corroborates hypertension, infections, and immunosuppressant medication as common trigger factors. Indeed, hypertension was frequent, with 45% of patients displaying elevated systolic blood pressure, underlining the importance of this factor in the development of PRES. In contrast, seizures as a presenting symptom were previously reported to be as frequent as 60%, while we observed seizures in only 30% of PRES patients, pointing towards clinical differences between PRES cohorts. Besides clinical findings, we also observed increased total protein levels in the CSF of PRES patients. However, elevated protein levels in the CSF are not disease-specific but were observed in a number of cases.

### Isolated cerebellar involvement in posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome [^113KNXuJ]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2015). Low credibility.

Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) is a serious and increasingly recognized disorder in humans. However, isolated cerebellar involvement in PRES is extremely uncommon. In this study, we sought to investigate its clinical and radiological features by describing a cohort of cases with PRES and isolated cerebellar involvement.

- **Methods**: We report two patients with PRES with only cerebellar involvement and identified an additional nine cases using the PubMed database with the MeSH terms "posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome", "hypertensive encephalopathy", "hypertension", "cerebellum", "encephalopathy", and "magnetic resonance imaging". We then collectively analyzed the clinical and imaging characteristics of these 11 cases.

- **Results**: The average age was 28 years, with 8 male and 3 female patients. All cases had severe acute hypertension and T2 hyperintensity on MRI exclusively centered within the cerebellum. Of the 11 patients, 7 had hypertensive retinopathy, a favorable clinical course with only antihypertensive treatment, and resolution of the cerebellar lesions on follow-up imaging. A total of 5 of the 11 patients received external ventricular drainage due to obstructive hydrocephalus, and only 2 of the 11 had a seizure.

- **Conclusions**: Isolated cerebellar involvement in PRES may be a unique variant that affects younger, male cases with severe acute hypertension and hypertensive retinopathy but not necessarily seizure. Most patients have full recovery after fast control of blood pressure. Awareness of atypical neuroimaging features in PRES is critical.

### Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome: Do predisposing risk factors make a difference in MRI appearance [^113LD1py]. Neuroradiology (2009). Low credibility.

Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) is a clinico-neuroradiological entity, characterized by typical neurological deficits, distinctive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) features, and a usually benign clinical course. Although frequently seen in association with hypertensive conditions, many other predisposing factors, notably cytotoxic and immunosuppressant drugs, have been associated with PRES. The aim of this study was to determine differences in the MR appearance of PRES according to various risk factors.

- **Methods**: Thirty consecutive patients with clinical and MRI findings consistent with PRES were included. We identified 24 patients with hypertension-related conditions, including 14 patients with preeclampsia-eclampsia, and six patients without hypertension, in whom PRES was associated with exposure to neurotoxic substances. Lesion distribution, extent of disease, and number of affected brain regions were compared between patients with PRES with and without hypertension, and patients with PRES with and without preeclampsia-eclampsia, respectively.

- **Results**: No statistically significant differences in the distribution of lesions and the extent of disease were observed between patients with PRES with or without hypertension, and patients with or without preeclampsia-eclampsia, respectively. The number of affected brain regions was significantly higher in patients with preeclampsia-eclampsia (p = 0.046), and the basal ganglia region was more frequently involved in these patients (p = 0.066).

- **Conclusion**: Apart from a significantly higher number of involvements.

### Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome [^1177VCYQ]. Journal of Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

The posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) is a neurological disorder of (sub)acute onset characterized by varied neurological symptoms, which may include headache, impaired visual acuity or visual field deficits, disorders of consciousness, confusion, seizures, and focal neurological deficits. In the majority of patients, the clinical presentation includes elevated arterial blood pressure leading up to hypertensive emergencies. Neuroimaging, particularly magnetic resonance imaging, frequently shows a distinctive parieto-occipital pattern with a symmetric distribution of changes reflecting vasogenic edema. PRES frequently develops in the context of cytotoxic medication, (pre)eclampsia, sepsis, renal disease, or autoimmune disorders. The treatment is symptomatic and determined by the underlying condition. The overall prognosis is favorable, as both clinical symptoms and imaging lesions are reversible in most patients. However, neurological sequelae, including long-term epilepsy, may persist in individual cases.

### Severe and isolated headache associated with hypertension as unique clinical presentation of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome [^113hpW7m]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES), first described by Hinchey et al. in 1996, is a clinicoradiological condition presenting with headache, seizures, alterations of conscious level, and loss of vision, accompanied by characteristic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings. Both the neurological and radiological features are potentially reversible. Nevertheless, several complications, such as status epilepticus, intracranial hemorrhage, and massive ischemic infarction, have been reported in association with this syndrome. The removal of the underlying causes is essential to prevent long-term sequelae.

We report a child with PRES presenting as hypertension and severe headache, with rapid clinical and neuroimaging normalization after prompt treatment.

### The innate immune response characterizes posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome [^1155WKcE]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2021). Low credibility.

We included 44 patients with a mean follow-up of 16.3 months (SD ± 12.9). Diagnosis was established according to clinical and radiological findings as described in the "Methods" section (Fig. 2a shows a characteristic case). The median age at manifestation of PRES was 64 years (IQR 29.8), with most patients being female (n = 33, 75%) (Table 1). On average, patients required a median hospital stay of 10 days (IQR 8). No deaths were recorded.

Severe hypertension was the most common trigger for PRES in this study (n = 20, 45.4%), followed by renal or liver failure (n = 11, 25.0%). Three cases were attributed to immunosuppressant medication or chemotherapy (6.8%). The remaining cases were associated with severe infections (n = 11, 25%) or remained unknown (n = 10, 22.7%). Systolic blood pressure at admission was elevated, with 145 mmHg (IQR 40). Headache was the most frequent symptom on presentation (61.3% of cases), often with occipital accentuation, followed by visual disturbances. The presentation included both hemianopsia and total vision loss (56.8% of cases), paresis (36.3%), seizures (31.8% of cases), and altered consciousness (20.4% of cases). No in-hospital deaths were recorded. The median time between admission and sample collection was 1 day (IQR 0–2 days).

The median age of patients serving as control was 34.3 years (IQR 25.9). There was a female predominance, with 47 patients being women (65.2%).

### Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome: A unique presentation [^111siUGc]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

We present a case of a patient presenting with posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome to the emergency department. We discuss the various symptoms that lead to the identification of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome and the important clinical clues. Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome is a very uncommon diagnosis and clinical presentation that requires understanding of the condition and awareness in specific patient populations. Without this understanding, the diagnosis may be missed, and appropriate management delayed.

### Frequency of ischaemic stroke and intracranial haemorrhage in patients with reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome (RCVS) and posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) - A systematic review [^116XS6bG]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). High credibility.

The main findings of our systematic review and meta-analysis are as follows: A significant proportion of patients with RCVS and PRES suffer from ischaemic stroke and intracranial haemorrhage. In patients with RCVS, haemorrhage is more frequent than ischaemic stroke, and the majority of haemorrhages are subarachnoid haemorrhages (SAH). In patients with PRES, ischaemic stroke and intracranial haemorrhage seem equally frequent, and SAH and intraparenchymal haemorrhage (IPH) are equally common in patients with PRES.

Previous studies have shown that PRES and RCVS can occur simultaneously or as overlapping phenomena in some cases. Our findings advocate that both conditions — although per definition 'reversible' and thought to have a benign course — are not benign in a significant percentage of patients. They can indeed have a complicated course, leading to increased morbidity. Ischaemic stroke and intracranial haemorrhage are two well-known complications and the most common cause for an incomplete recovery. We found that across all studies, up to a quarter of the patients suffered an outcome, either ischaemic stroke, intracranial haemorrhage, or both.

PRES is a known complication (7%–38%) of RCVS. Shared pathophysiological mechanisms may explain the simultaneous occurrence of PRES and RCVS. Most of the haemorrhages occurred within the first week. PRES and subsequent ischemia increased steadily within 2–3 weeks. This time pattern can be explained by the underlying dysfunction in the control of cerebral arterial tone.

### Fruzaqla [^114SAK1q]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES)**: Fruzaqla can cause PRES, a syndrome of subcortical vasogenic edema diagnosed by characteristic findings on MRI. PRES occurred in one of 911 patients with mCRC treated with Fruzaqla. Evaluate patients presenting with seizures, headache, visual disturbances, confusion, or altered mental function for PRES. Discontinue Fruzaqla in patients who develop PRES.

- **Impaired wound healing**: Impaired wound healing can occur in patients receiving drugs that inhibit the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling pathway. Among 911 patients with mCRC treated with Fruzaqla, one patient experienced a Grade 2 event of wound dehiscence. Do not administer Fruzaqla for at least two weeks prior to major surgery. Do not administer Fruzaqla for at least two weeks after major surgery and until adequate wound healing has occurred. The safety of resuming Fruzaqla after resolution of wound healing complications has not been established.

- **Arterial thromboembolic events**: Fruzaqla may increase the risk of arterial thromboembolic events. In 911 patients with mCRC treated with Fruzaqla, seven patients (0.8%) experienced an arterial thromboembolic event. Fruzaqla studies excluded patients with clinically significant cardiovascular disease, uncontrolled hypertension, or with thromboembolic events within the prior six months. Careful consideration is necessary when initiating Fruzaqla in patients with a recent history of thromboembolic events. Discontinue Fruzaqla in patients who develop arterial thromboembolism.

### Detection of microhemorrhage in posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome using susceptibility-weighted imaging [^111qAb5Y]. AJNR American Journal of Neuroradiology (2012). Low credibility.

PRES-related vasogenic edema is potentially reversible, while hemorrhage occurs in only 15.2% to 17.3% of patients. However, the true incidence of hemorrhage could be higher when susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) is considered. Thus, we set out to determine the incidence of microhemorrhages (MH), subarachnoid hemorrhages (SAH), and intraparenchymal hemorrhages (IPH) in posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) by using SWI and particularly to evaluate whether such MHs are reversible.

- **Materials and methods**: Thirty-one patients with PRES and SWI were included in the study, with 17 having follow-up SWI. Two neuroradiologists reviewed SWI, fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR), diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), and contrast-enhanced T1-weighted imaging (CE-T1WI). The presence and number of MHs (≥ 5 mm) were recorded at presentation and follow-up. We evaluated associations between the presence of MH on SWI and DWI lesions, SAH, IPH, contrast enhancement, and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging severity.

- **Results**: Hemorrhage was present in 20 of 31 patients (64.5%), with MHs on SWI in 18 of 31 (58.1%) at presentation and in 11 of 17 (64.7%) at follow-up. SAH was present in 3 of 31 on SWI and 4 of 31 on FLAIR, while 2 of 31 had IPH. At follow-up, no patients had acquired new MHs; 2 of 5 MHs in one patient resolved. Four patients with available SWI before PRES developed MHs after PRES onset. No association was found between the presence of MHs on SWI and DWI, SAH, IPH, enhancement, and MR imaging severity (all P > .05).

- **Conclusions**: SWI showed a higher rate of MH than previously described, underscoring the potential of SWI in evaluating PRES. Such MHs typically persist and may develop after PRES onset. However, the clinical relevance of MHs in PRES is yet to be determined. We propose that MHs in PRES relate to endothelial cell dysfunction.

### Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome in cancer patients: a single institution retrospective study [^112JdsMK]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2016). Low credibility.

Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) is a clinico-radiologic entity. Its management and outcome in the oncology population is limited because it is still difficult to identify despite an increasingly recognized occurrence. This study is the largest retrospective examination of PRES in cancer patients reported from a single institution. We explore the clinical manifestations and radiologic features to comprehensively assess PRES in order to prevent permanent neurologic deficits and mortality. We retrospectively identified 69 patients with cancer who developed PRES at MDACC between January 2006 and June 2012. Clinical and radiographic data were abstracted from their records and reviewed for our analysis. The mean age at PRES onset was 52 ± 17.8 years. Fifty-two (75%; p < 0.001) patients were women. The most common diagnoses were leukemia (30%) and lymphoma (12%).

- **Treatment data**: Forty-eight (70%) patients were treated with chemotherapy, 21 (30%) underwent bone marrow transplantation, and 14 (20%) received tacrolimus.

- **Clinical presentation**: The most common clinical presentation was seizures (67%). PRES was associated with hypertension in 62 (90%) patients. On brain MRI, 33 (44%) patients had some evidence of hemorrhage, and 22 (73%) of these were thrombocytopenic. Thirty-five (51%) patients fully recovered, while 19 (28%) had permanent neurological deficits.

- **Morbidity and mortality factors**: Morbidity and mortality were associated with continuation of the offending agent, thrombocytopenia, variations in mean arterial pressure ≥ 20 mmHg, electrographic seizures at onset, atypical MRI patterns, and delay in diagnostic imaging (7.4 ± 4.8 days vs. 1.9 ± 1.8 days; p = 0.031).
