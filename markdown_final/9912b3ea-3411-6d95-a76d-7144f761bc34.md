## Question

What is large volume thoracocentesis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what large-volume thoracentesis is. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining the procedure and its typical volume thresholds. Then, I should verify the clinical indications and goals. Next, I will examine the pathophysiology that explains symptom relief. After that, I need to assess safety, complications, and risk modifiers. Finally, I should integrate guideline-based best practices and synthesize a concise, clinically useful definition with caveats and monitoring advice.

> Let me first confirm the definition and volume thresholds. Large-volume thoracentesis is a therapeutic pleural drainage procedure in which a substantial amount of pleural fluid is removed in a single session, typically on the order of 1,000 to 1,500 mL or more, with many studies and series using ≥ 1,500 mL as a working threshold for "large volume" and some cohorts including patients drained up to 2–3 L or more when clinically indicated and tolerated [^4fd3e488] [^7bc331fa] [^62133d17].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about indications without anchoring them to guidelines. I need to check the primary clinical goals: symptom relief of dyspnea, assessment of whether symptoms are effusion-related, and evaluation of lung expandability, particularly in malignant pleural effusion where expandability influences the choice between pleurodesis and an indwelling pleural catheter; guidelines also support therapeutic thoracentesis for symptomatic effusions of other etiologies, including hepatic hydrothorax, when dyspnea or hypoxemia are present [^04d7c90e] [^a84cd62f] [^e5255fe6] [^7b413133].

> Next, I should review the pathophysiology explaining symptom improvement. Wait, let me verify whether gas exchange changes drive relief; in fact, improvements in oxygenation are modest and inconsistent, whereas the dominant mechanism appears to be restoration of respiratory mechanics: reduction in pleural pressure, improved diaphragmatic excursion, and decreased work of breathing, with some studies showing hemodynamic benefits via improved preload and ventricular filling after large-volume drainage, though these effects vary by patient and effusion size [^a313ab7a] [^cfabe9a3] [^f099e6cf].

> I will now examine safety and complications, and I should double-check the risk of re-expansion pulmonary edema (RPE). Contemporary series suggest RPE is rare overall, around 0.5–1% clinically, with some large cohorts showing even lower rates, and risk does not appear to correlate strictly with the absolute volume removed; however, risk may rise with very large volumes, rapid drainage, or nonexpandable lung physiology, and rare case reports and series document RPE after large-volume taps, reinforcing the need for symptom-guided termination and caution with rapid evacuation [^7bc331fa] [^4fd3e488] [^62133d17] [^c20c993c].

> Let me consider other complications and modifiers. Pneumothorax risk is reduced with ultrasound guidance and operator experience, and bleeding is uncommon even in the presence of mild coagulopathy; importantly, a large 12-year experience found no association between bleeding and INR or platelet count, supporting a more permissive approach to coagulation parameters when clinically necessary, though individualized judgment remains essential [^e34e87bb] [^62133d17] [^cb673efe].

> But wait, what about pleural manometry — does it help prevent complications during large-volume thoracentesis? I should confirm the randomized data. The pivotal RCT showed that routine manometry did not reduce chest discomfort compared with symptom-guided stopping, although it did reduce asymptomatic pneumothorax ex vacuo; given this, manometry can be used selectively when nonexpandable lung is suspected or when pleural elastance would change management, but it is not mandated for all large-volume procedures [^df383e3e] [^6f29420d].

> Next, I should review best-practice technique to mitigate risks. Ultrasound guidance is strongly recommended to mark the site, assess effusion characteristics, and reduce pneumothorax; many guidelines advise against routine post-procedure chest radiography when ultrasound confirms lung sliding and the patient is asymptomatic; stopping criteria should prioritize patient-reported chest discomfort, intractable cough, or a pleural pressure drop to very negative values (often cited around −20 cm H₂O), with slower, controlled drainage favored over rapid vacuum-assisted removal when feasible [^23fa44e5] [^8ff3eef1] [^df383e3e] [^8bb47d2d].

> Let me synthesize a clinically useful definition, and I should ensure it aligns with evidence and guidelines. Large-volume thoracentesis is a therapeutic removal of pleural fluid, typically 1,500 mL or more in a single session, performed to relieve dyspnea, confirm that symptoms are effusion-related, and assess lung expandability; it is generally safe with low rates of serious complications when performed with ultrasound guidance and symptom-based stopping rules, though clinicians should remain vigilant for rare RPE and tailor the procedure to patient tolerance and lung mechanics [^4fd3e488] [^04d7c90e] [^e5255fe6].

---

Large-volume thoracentesis is the **therapeutic removal of ≥ 1,500 mL of pleural fluid** [^4fd3e488] in a single session to relieve dyspnea and assess lung expandability, especially in malignant pleural effusions [^04d7c90e]. It is generally safe when performed with ultrasound guidance [^23fa44e5] and symptom monitoring, with a **low risk of re-expansion pulmonary edema (RPE)** [^7bc331fa] and other complications [^62133d17]. Routine pleural manometry is not required [^df383e3e], but clinicians should stop if the patient develops chest discomfort, cough, or excessive negative pleural pressure [^6f29420d].

---

## Definition and clinical indications

Large-volume thoracentesis is defined as the **removal of ≥ 1,500 mL of pleural fluid** in a single procedure [^4fd3e488]. It is indicated for:

- **Symptom relief**: Rapid alleviation of dyspnea and respiratory distress caused by large pleural effusions [^e5255fe6].
- **Diagnostic assessment**: Evaluation of lung expandability, particularly in malignant pleural effusions, to guide subsequent management (e.g. pleurodesis or indwelling pleural catheter) [^04d7c90e] [^a84cd62f].
- **Therapeutic intervention**: Management of recurrent or refractory pleural effusions, including malignant pleural effusions and hepatic hydrothorax [^7b413133].

---

## Physiological effects

Large-volume thoracentesis produces **immediate physiological changes**, including:

- **Improved respiratory mechanics**: Reduction in pleural pressure, enhancement of lung volumes, and decreased work of breathing [^a313ab7a].
- **Hemodynamic effects**: Improved cardiac preload and ventricular function, particularly in patients with large effusions causing hemodynamic compromise [^f099e6cf].
- **Gas exchange**: Variable effects on oxygenation, with some studies showing minimal or no significant improvement in arterial oxygenation [^54d23148].

---

## Safety and complications

Large-volume thoracentesis is generally safe when performed with appropriate precautions; however, **potential complications** include:

- **Re-expansion pulmonary edema (RPE)**: Rare but serious, occurring in approximately 0.5–1% of cases [^7bc331fa] [^4fd3e488].
- **Pneumothorax**: Incidence reduced significantly with ultrasound guidance [^e34e87bb] [^702e8ecd].
- **Bleeding**: Rare, even in patients with mild coagulopathies [^cb673efe].
- **Chest discomfort**: Common but typically mild and self-limited [^5a228ded].

---

## Procedural considerations and best practices

To **minimize complications and maximize efficacy**, the following best practices are recommended:

- **Ultrasound guidance**: Essential for accurate localization, reducing pneumothorax risk, and improving success rates [^23fa44e5] [^702e8ecd].
- **Symptom monitoring**: Continuous assessment of chest discomfort, cough, and respiratory status during the procedure [^df383e3e].
- **Pleural manometry**: Optional; routine use is not supported by evidence, but may be considered in select cases to monitor pleural pressure and prevent excessive negative pressure [^df383e3e] [^6f29420d].
- **Stopping criteria**: Stop if the patient experiences significant chest discomfort, persistent cough, or if pleural pressure drops below −20 cm H₂O [^df383e3e].

---

## Clinical outcomes and patient satisfaction

Large-volume thoracentesis is associated with **high patient satisfaction** due to immediate symptom relief and improved quality of life. Long-term outcomes depend on the underlying etiology of the effusion and the need for repeat procedures or definitive interventions (e.g. pleurodesis or indwelling pleural catheter) [^1aecef60].

---

## Summary of evidence

| **Aspect** | **Evidence summary** |
|-|-|
| Definition | ≥ 1,500 mL in a single session [^4fd3e488] |
| Indications | Symptom relief, diagnostic assessment, therapeutic intervention [^e5255fe6] [^04d7c90e] |
| Complications | RPE (0.5–1%), pneumothorax, bleeding, chest discomfort [^7bc331fa] [^62133d17] |
| Best practices | Ultrasound guidance, symptom monitoring, selective pleural manometry [^23fa44e5] [^df383e3e] |
| Outcomes | High patient satisfaction, immediate symptom relief [^notfound] |

---

Large-volume thoracentesis is a **clinically valuable procedure** for managing large pleural effusions, providing immediate symptom relief and diagnostic information. When performed with ultrasound guidance and appropriate monitoring, it is safe and effective, with a low risk of serious complications.

### Re-expansion pulmonary edema (REPE) following thoracentesis: is large-volume thoracentesis associated with increased incidence of REPE? [^4fd3e488]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To determine the safety and efficacy associated with drainage volumes greater than 1,500 mL in a single, unilateral thoracentesis without pleural manometry measurements.

Materials and Methods

This retrospective, single-institution study included 872 patients (18 years and older) who underwent ultrasound-guided thoracentesis. Patient and procedures data were collected including demographics, number of and laterality of thoracenteses, volume and consistency of fluid removed, and whether clinical or radiologic evidence of re-expansion pulmonary edema (REPE) developed within 24 h of thoracentesis. Fisher's exact test was used to test the significance of the relationship between volume of fluid removed and evidence of REPE.

Results

A total of 1376 thoracenteses were performed among the patients included in the study. The mean volume of fluid removed among all procedures was 901.1 mL (SD = 641.7 mL), with 194 (14.1%) procedures involving the removal of ≥ 1,500 mL of fluid. In total, six (0.7%) patients developed signs of REPE following thoracentesis, five of which were a first-time thoracentesis. No statistically significant difference in incidence of REPE was observed between those with ≥ 1,500 mL of fluid removed compared to those with < 1,500 mL of fluid removed (p-value = 0.599).

Conclusions

Large-volume thoracentesis may safely improve patients' symptoms while preventing the need for repeat procedures.

### Improving the safety of thoracentesis [^e46874a2]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Thoracentesis is a common bedside procedure associated with iatrogenic complications including pneumothorax. Experienced clinicians using optimal procedural techniques within a supportive system can achieve improvements in safety. However, clinicians have been relatively slow to adopt these changes. This review examines the available literature regarding procedural safety of thoracentesis with emphasis on best practice models to reduce iatrogenic complications.

Recent Findings

Recent studies have identified procedure-specific variables that are independently associated with iatrogenic pneumothorax including inexperienced operators, lack of ultrasound imaging, and large-volume aspiration of fluid. Development of a best practice model including procedural training within a focused procedural group that utilizes ultrasound imaging further improves thoracentesis procedural safety.

Summary

Several procedural modifications have led to improvements in thoracentesis procedural safety in reducing iatrogenic complications. Herein, we review the known risks associated with thoracentesis and identify the modifiable and nonmodifiable risk factors. On the basis of recent studies, we make recommendations and encourage incorporation of 'best practice' techniques for thoracentesis procedures.

### Symptom relief after large-volume thoracentesis in the absence of lung perfusion [^11d6afc0]. Chest (2014). Low credibility.

The physiologic basis for relief from dyspnea after therapeutic thoracentesis remains poorly understood. Here, we describe the case of a 46-year-old man with large recurrent pleural effusion with absent perfusion to the affected lung who experienced dramatic dyspnea relief after large-volume thoracentesis. This patient's improvement in breathlessness cannot be attributed to improved gas exchange and suggests the primary physiologic basis for the relief in dyspnea is a change in respiratory system mechanics or work of breathing.

Regarding specific circumstances for pleural effusion, more specifically with respect to patients with malignant pleural effusion, thoracentesis, ATS/STR/STS 2018 guidelines recommend to consider performing large-volume thoracentesis in patients with symptomatic malignant pleural effusion if it is uncertain whether the patient's symptoms are related to the effusion and/or if the lung is expandable (the latter if pleurodesis is contemplated) to assess lung expansion.

### Gravity-vs Wall suction-driven large-volume thoracentesis: a randomized controlled study [^af0d3ce8]. Chest (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Prior studies have found no differences in procedural chest discomfort for patients undergoing manual syringe aspiration or drainage with gravity after thoracentesis. However, whether gravity drainage could protect against chest pain due to the larger negative-pressure gradient generated by wall suction has not been investigated.

Research Question

Does wall suction drainage result in more chest discomfort compared with gravity drainage in patients undergoing large-volume thoracentesis?

Study Design and Methods

In this multicenter, single-blinded, randomized controlled trial, patients with large free-flowing effusions of ≥ 500 mL were assigned at a 1:1 ratio to wall suction or gravity drainage. Wall suction was performed with a suction system attached to the suction tubing and with vacuum pressure adjusted to full vacuum. Gravity drainage was performed with a drainage bag placed 100 cm below the catheter insertion site and connected via straight tubing. Patients rated chest discomfort on a 100-mm visual analog scale before, during, and after drainage. The primary outcome was postprocedural chest discomfort at 5 minutes. Secondary outcomes included measures of postprocedure chest discomfort, breathlessness, procedure time, volume of fluid drained, and complication rates.

Results

Of the 228 patients initially randomized, 221 were included in the final analysis. The primary outcome of procedural chest discomfort did not differ significantly between the groups (P = 0.08), nor did the secondary outcomes of postprocedural discomfort and dyspnea. Similar volumes were drained in both groups, but the procedure duration was longer in the gravity arm by approximately 3 minutes. No differences in rate of pneumothorax or reexpansion pulmonary edema were noted between the two groups.

Interpretation

Thoracentesis via wall suction and gravity drainage results in similar levels of procedural discomfort and dyspnea improvement.

### Pleural effusion: diagnostic approach in adults [^e5255fe6]. American Family Physician (2023). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic procedures for pleural effusion, more specifically with respect to diagnostic thoracentesis, AAFP 2023 guidelines recommend to perform diagnostic thoracentesis for new-onset, unilateral, and larger than minimal pleural effusions in the absence of clinically evident HF, cirrhosis, or kidney failure appropriately responsive to therapy. Perform therapeutic thoracentesis to relieve symptoms.

### Routine monitoring with pleural manometry during therapeutic large-volume thoracentesis to prevent pleural-pressure-related complications: a multicentre, single-blind randomised controlled trial [^df383e3e]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Background

In patients with non-expandable lung, removal of pleural fluid can result in excessively negative pleural pressure, which is associated with chest discomfort, pneumothorax, and re-expansion pulmonary oedema. Pleural manometry is widely used to safeguard against pressure-related complications during thoracentesis despite little evidence to support the approach. We investigated whether monitoring of pleural pressure with manometry during thoracentesis could protect against complications compared with assessment of symptoms alone.

Methods

We did a prospective randomised single-blind trial involving patients with large pleural effusions at two academic medical centres in, Nashville, TN, and Baltimore, MD, USA. Eligible patients were adults with free-flowing effusions estimated to be at least 0·5 L who could remain seated throughout the procedure. Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive thoracentesis guided by symptoms only (control) or by symptoms plus manometry at timepoints based on volume drained. The randomisation schedule was computer generated, used permuted blocks of four and six, and was stratified by participating institution. Patients, who were masked to study-group assignment, were asked to rate chest discomfort on 100 mm visual analogue scales before, during, and after drainage. In both groups drainage was discontinued before complete evacuation of pleural fluid if patients developed persistent chest discomfort, intractable cough, or other complications. In the manometry group, an additional criterion for stopping was if end-expiratory pleural pressure was lower than −20 cm H₂O or declined by more than 10 cm H₂O between two measurements to a value less than or equal to −10 cm H₂O. The primary outcome was overall chest discomfort from before the start to after the procedure measured by patients 5 min after the end of drainage. Analysis was by modified intention to treat (ie, included all patients with any procedure or outcome data). This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02677883.

Findings

Between March 4, 2016, and Sept 8, 2017, 191 patients were screened, of whom 128 were randomly assigned treatment and 124 were included in the final analysis (62 in each group). Four patients were excluded because of manometer malfunction (n = 2), inability to access effusion due to pleural tumour burden (n = 1), and inability to remain seated (n = 1). Groups did not differ for the primary outcome (mean difference in chest discomfort score 2·4 mm, 95% CI -5·7 to 10·5, p = 0·56). Six (10%) of 62 patients in the control group had asymptomatic pneumothorax ex vacuo compared with none in the manometry group (p = 0·01). No serious complications occurred in either group.

Interpretation

Measurement of pleural pressure by manometry during large-volume thoracentesis does not alter procedure-related chest discomfort. Our findings do not support the routine use of this approach.

### Large-volume thoracentesis and the risk of reexpansion pulmonary edema [^7bc331fa]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Background

To avoid reexpansion pulmonary edema (RPE), thoracenteses are often limited to draining no more than 1 L. There are, however, significant clinical benefits to removing more than 1 L of fluid. The purpose of this study was to define the incidence of RPE among patients undergoing large-volume (≥ 1 L) thoracentesis.

Methods

One hundred eighty-five patients undergoing large-volume thoracentesis were included in this study. The volume of fluid removed, absolute pleural pressure, pleural elastance, and symptoms during thoracentesis were compared in patients who did and did not experience RPE.

Results

Of the 185 patients, 98 (53%) had between 1 L and 1.5 L withdrawn, 40 (22%) had between 1.5 L and 2 L withdrawn, 38 (20%) had between 2 L and 3 L withdrawn, and 9 (5%) had more than 3 L withdrawn. Only 1 patient (0.5%, 95% confidence interval: 0.01% to 3%) experienced clinical RPE. Four patients (2.2%, 95% confidence interval: 0.06% to 5.4%) had radiographic RPE (diagnosed only on postprocedure imaging without clinical symptoms). The incidence of RPE was not associated with the absolute change in pleural pressure, pleural elastance, or symptoms during thoracentesis.

Conclusions

Clinical and radiographic RPE after large-volume thoracentesis is rare and independent of the volume of fluid removed, pleural pressures, and pleural elastance. The recommendation to terminate thoracentesis after removing 1 L of fluid needs to be reconsidered: large effusions can, and should, be drained completely as long as chest discomfort or end-expiratory pleural pressure less than −20 cm H₂O does not develop.

### Minimal clinically important difference for chest discomfort in patients undergoing pleural interventions [^5a228ded]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Pleural effusion is a common diagnosis, making thoracentesis one of the most commonly performed medical procedures. Large-volume thoracentesis has been associated with several complications, including chest discomfort. Improvement in breathlessness is an important clinical goal for this procedure. Randomised controlled trials evaluating pleural fluid aspiration commonly use the visual analogue scale (VAS) to measure patient-centred outcomes such as dyspnoea and discomfort. A VAS for chest discomfort consists of a 100 mm long line with 'no discomfort at all' printed at one end and 'worst possible discomfort' at the other; patients are asked to make a mark through the line indicating where their current symptoms fall along that continuum, with the distance in millimetres along the line to the mark representing their numerical VAS score.

Importantly, interpretation of data derived from these scales requires a determination of the minimal clinically important difference (MCID), defined as the smallest change in VAS score perceived as clinically significant. This contrasts with the statistical significance, which may not be relevant to patient care. For example, the smallest possible between-group difference in VAS score of 1 mm could be statistically significant if a trial were very large. Knowledge of how much a score must change before a patient perceives the change as meaningful or worthwhile is necessary to interpret whether a reported difference is clinically significant. As a result, MCIDs are vital to power calculations in trials using patient-centred primary outcomes measured by VAS, as enrollment targets are selected to allow detection of a difference between study groups at the threshold of MCID.

Various methods for determining the MCID have been described. The most direct method involves anchoring a change in the tool being investigated to another scale that directly inquires as to whether a change of significance has occurred, such as a Likert scale.

A previously determined MCID for pain of 13 mm on 100 mm VAS derived from emergency department patients with trauma has been used for all recent studies using 100 mm VAS to measure chest discomfort related to pleural fluid aspiration. We hypothesised that acute traumatic pain may differ sufficiently from the chest discomfort associated with large-volume thoracentesis to result in a different MCID. The primary aim of this study was to determine the MCID for the VAS for chest discomfort in patients undergoing thoracentesis using a Likert scale anchor.

### Improved heart hemodynamics after draining large-volume pleural effusion: a prospective cohort study [^d4538a2d]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Large-volume pleural effusion (PE) is a common complication causing breathlessness, and patients often experience dramatic and immediate relief from dyspnea after therapeutic thoracentesis. Although it is a well-recognized phenomenon, the detailed mechanism underlying witnessed improvements following drainage remains poorly understood. The reasons for breathlessness caused by PE maybe multifactorial, but improvements in pulmonary mechanics do not explain the degree of relief following thoracentesis.

Previous studies have focused on the effects of PE on cardiovascular hemodynamics. Case reports have shown that PE can cause circulatory instability and hemodynamic compromise through a mechanism resembling cardiac tamponade. An early animal model study supported this phenomenon. Other investigators have proposed that drainage after pleurocentesis may contribute to cardiac preload improvement and hemodynamic optimization in large-volume PE patients. However, exactly when the hemodynamic change is most obvious remains unknown; therefore, evaluating the effect of drainage on the cardiovascular system at different points in time may be beneficial and may contribute to understanding the resulting dyspnea relief.

The aim of this prospective study was to assess the effects of drainage of large-volume PE and changes in cardiac function at different time points, then to compare the hemodynamic measurements between PE on different sides of the thorax.

### Management of malignant pleural effusions. An official ATS / STS / STR clinical practice guideline [^a84cd62f]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

American Thoracic Society — Symptomatic MPE evaluation with large-volume thoracentesis and pleural manometry — Nonexpandable lung occurs in at least 30% of patients with MPEs and may be a contraindication for pleurodesis; recent data also suggest that up to 60% of patients will require another procedure within 9 days after initial drainage. Only one study has examined the use of manometry in predicting "longer-term" outcomes: in 55 patients with MPE undergoing temporary pleurodesis, an elastance of less than 19 cm H2O measured after draining 500 mL predicted a 98% chance of success at 1 month, while all 11 patients with an elastance of 19 cm H2O or greater did not achieve pleurodesis. In patients with symptomatic MPE, we suggest large-volume thoracentesis if it is uncertain whether the patient's symptoms are related to the effusion and/or if the lung is expandable (the latter if pleurodesis is contemplated) to assess lung expansion (conditional recommendation, very low confidence in estimate of effects; Tables E4E and E5C). If the plan is to manage the MPE with an IPC, a large-volume thoracentesis to assess lung expansion, regardless of whether the lung expands and an additional procedure (therapeutic thoracentesis), may not be required.

### Management of malignant pleural effusions. An official ATS / STS / STR clinical practice guideline [^29d863ef]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

This Guideline, a collaborative effort from the American Thoracic Society, Society of Thoracic Surgeons, and Society of Thoracic Radiology, aims to provide evidence-based recommendations to guide contemporary management of patients with a malignant pleural effusion (MPE).

Methods

A multidisciplinary panel developed seven questions using the PICO (Population, Intervention, Comparator, and Outcomes) format. The GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach and the Evidence to Decision framework was applied to each question. Recommendations were formulated, discussed, and approved by the entire panel.

Results

The panel made weak recommendations in favor of: 1) using ultrasound to guide pleural interventions; 2) not performing pleural interventions in asymptomatic patients with MPE; 3) using either an indwelling pleural catheter (IPC) or chemical pleurodesis in symptomatic patients with MPE and suspected expandable lung; 4) performing large-volume thoracentesis to assess symptomatic response and lung expansion; 5) using either talc poudrage or talc slurry for chemical pleurodesis; 6) using IPC instead of chemical pleurodesis in patients with nonexpandable lung or failed pleurodesis; and 7) treating IPC-associated infections with antibiotics and not removing the catheter.

Conclusions

These recommendations, based on the best available evidence, can guide management of patients with MPE and improve patient outcomes.

### A prospective study of the volume of pleural fluid required for accurate diagnosis of malignant pleural effusion [^cda3bde0]. Chest (2009). Low credibility.

Background

This is a prospective study to define the volume of pleural fluid adequate for maximal yield of cytologic analysis of pleural fluid.

Methods

Patients undergoing diagnostic thoracentesis with malignancy in the differential diagnosis were enrolled in the study. The first 50 mL of pleural fluid were put in a specimen cup, and subsequent fluid was collected in a drainage bag. Both samples were sent for cytologic evaluation. The cytologist was blinded as to which specimen was being evaluated.

Results

Forty-four patients (21 men, 23 women; mean [± SD] age, 46 ± 11.1 years) were enrolled in the study. The average volume of the "large-volume" specimen was 890 ± 375 mL (range, 250 to 1,800). Although malignant pleural involvement had never been documented for any patients, 31 patients had received a diagnosis of malignancy prior to undergoing thoracentesis. Cytologic tests were positive for malignancy in 23 of the 44 patients (55%). In the group of patients with an established history of cancer, pleural fluid was positive for malignant cells in 19 of 33 samples (58%). In all 23 patients with malignant pleural effusion, both the 50-mL specimen and the large-volume specimen were cytologically identical. In all 21 patients with negative pleural cytology findings, there was again 100% concordance between the 50-mL samples and the larger samples. The minimum adequate pleural fluid volume for cytologic diagnosis has been a matter of debate. The strongest data to date came from a retrospective study in 2002.

Conclusions

Our prospective study now unequivocally supports the concept that the submission of > 50 mL of pleural fluid for cytologic analysis does not increase diagnostic yield.

Purpose

To study trends in volume and reimbursement for paracentesis and thoracentesis by physicians and advanced practice providers (APPs) after the introduction of discreet Current Procedural Terminology codes for image guidance.

Methods

Medicare claims for 2012 to 2018 (paracentesis) and 2013 to 2018 (thoracentesis) were extracted using Current Procedural Terminology codes for blind and image-guided paracentesis and thoracentesis. Total volumes were analyzed by provider specialty. Nonfacility reimbursement and relative value units were compared.

Results

For blind paracentesis, volume decreased from 17,393 to 12,226 procedures from 2012 to 2018. Conversely, volume of image-guided paracentesis increased from 171,631 to 253,834 procedures. Radiology performed the majority of image-guide paracentesis (83.9% in 2012 and 77.1% in 2018). Volume and relative share for APPs dramatically increased (from 10.2% to 15.8%). For blind thoracentesis, volume decreased from 26,716 to 15,075 procedures from 2013 to 2018. Conversely, volume of image-guided thoracentesis increased from 187,168 to 222,673 procedures. Radiology performed the majority of image-guided thoracentesis (73.6% in 2013 and 66.2% in 2018). Volume and relative share for APPs dramatically increased (from 7.7% to 12.9%). Although reimbursement for both image-guided paracentesis and thoracentesis decreased, their reimbursement remained higher than that of blind paracentesis and thoracentesis throughout the study period.

Conclusion

A higher percentage of these procedures are being performed using image guidance; radiologists performed a growing number but declining percentage of image-guided paracentesis and thoracentesis. APPs are playing an increasing role, particularly using image guidance. Given decreasing reimbursement for these procedures, APPs can provide a large cost advantage in procedural radiology practices.

### AGA clinical practice update on surgical risk assessment and perioperative management in cirrhosis: expert review [^82f90335]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2019). High credibility.

AGA Clinical Practice Update — perioperative management of ascites in cirrhosis — states that ascites should be managed aggressively before surgical procedures and that, in patients with symptomatic ascites, large-volume total abdominal paracentesis should be performed preoperatively with intravenous albumin in a dose of 6–8 g for each liter of ascites fluid removed; once oral medications are tolerated, daily antibiotic prophylaxis can be resumed in patients with a history of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis or low ascites total protein; although preoperative antibiotics are of uncertain efficacy, an antibiotic such as ceftriaxone can be administered prophylactically in a dose of 1 g of every 24 hours intravenously until oral intake is possible again; preoperative thoracentesis is only recommended for moderate to large pleural effusions that compromise respiratory function, and administration of intravenous fluid and blood products should be limited perioperatively to avoid increasing extracellular volume, ascites, and portal venous pressure.

### Physiology of breathlessness associated with pleural effusions [^a313ab7a]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Pleural effusions have a major impact on the cardiorespiratory system. This article reviews the pathophysiological effects of pleural effusions and pleural drainage, their relationship with breathlessness, and highlights key knowledge gaps.

Recent Findings

The basis for breathlessness in pleural effusions and relief following thoracentesis is not well understood. Many existing studies on the pathophysiology of breathlessness in pleural effusions are limited by small sample sizes, heterogeneous design and a lack of direct measurements of respiratory muscle function. Gas exchange worsens with pleural effusions and improves after thoracentesis. Improvements in ventilatory capacity and lung volumes following pleural drainage are small, and correlate poorly with the volume of fluid drained and the severity of breathlessness. Rather than lung compression, expansion of the chest wall, including displacement of the diaphragm, appears to be the principle mechanism by which the effusion is accommodated. Deflation of the thoracic cage and restoration of diaphragmatic function after thoracentesis may improve diaphragm effectiveness and efficiency, and this may be an important mechanism by which breathlessness improves. Effusions do not usually lead to major hemodynamic changes, but large effusions may cause cardiac tamponade and ventricular diastolic collapse. Patients with effusions can have impaired exercise capacity and poor sleep quality and efficiency.

Summary

Pleural effusions are associated with abnormalities in gas exchange, respiratory mechanics, respiratory muscle function and hemodynamics, but the association between these abnormalities and breathlessness remains unclear. Prospective studies should aim to identify the key mechanisms of effusion-related breathlessness and predictors of improvement following pleural drainage.

### CT volumetric analysis of pleural effusions: a comparison with thoracentesis volumes [^41046ffe]. Academic Radiology (2015). Low credibility.

Rationale and Objectives

The primary objective of this study was to compare computed tomography (CT) volumetric analysis of pleural effusions with thoracentesis volumes. The secondary objective of this study was to compare subjective grading of pleural effusion size with thoracentesis volumes.

Materials and Methods

This was a retrospective study of 67 patients with free-flowing pleural effusions who underwent therapeutic thoracentesis. CT volumetric analysis was performed on all patients; the CT volumes were compared with the thoracentesis volumes. In addition, the subjective grading of pleural effusion size was compared with the thoracentesis volumes.

Results

The average difference between CT volume and thoracentesis volume was 9.4 mL (1.3%) ± 290 mL (30%); these volumes were not statistically different (P = 0.79, paired two-tailed Student's t-test). The thoracentesis volume of a "small", "moderate", and "large" pleural effusion, as graded on chest CT, was found to be approximately 410 ± 260 cc, 770 ± 270 mL and 1370 ± 650 mL, respectively; the thoracentesis volume of a "small", "moderate", and "large" pleural effusion, as graded on chest radiograph, was found to be approximately 610 ± 320 mL, 1040 ± 460 mL, and 1530 ± 830 mL, respectively.

Conclusions

CT volumetric analysis is an accessible tool that can be used to accurately quantify the size of pleural effusions.

### Malignant pleural disease: a pragmatic guide to diagnosis [^138b6f63]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The diagnosis of malignant pleural disease is important in the care of patients with cancer. However, a one-size-fits-all approach to diagnosis may lead to delays in care as the sensitivity of each biopsy modality varies and can be dependent on the tumor type. We review current literature on pleural biopsy techniques and propose a diagnostic algorithm for suspected malignant pleural disease.

Recent Findings

Recent literature has shown that the sensitivity of pleural fluid cytology varies based on tumor type resulting in a limited value of repeated thoracenteses in many cases. Furthermore, the ability to test for molecular biomarkers on pleural fluid samples has contributed to the recommendations to send large volumes of pleural fluid for analysis. Studies have also supported the consideration of medical thoracoscopy earlier in the diagnostic work-up of malignant pleural disease.

Summary

The decision to repeat a diagnostic thoracentesis when suspecting malignant pleural effusions should take into account the primary tumor type. Open pleural biopsy with medical thoracoscopy has been shown to be a relatively safe diagnostic modality with high sensitivity and should be considered in patients with a nondiagnostic thoracentesis.

### Management of malignant pleural effusions. An official ATS / STS / STR clinical practice guideline [^53931da9]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Management of patients with known or suspected malignant pleural effusion (MPE) — the algorithm branches to "Asymptomatic", where "Pleural intervention not needed (unless for diagnostic purposes)", and to "Symptomatic", where "Ultrasound-guided therapeutic thoracentesis (i.e., large-volume tap*)" is performed "With goals of assessing lung expansion and relief of dyspnea" and "may not be necessary if the patient's dyspnea is known to be attributable to the MPE". Subsequent decision-making includes "Lung re-expansion"; if "Predicted very short survival", then "Palliate dyspnea with: repeat thoracentesis if needed, oxygen, morphine", whereas if not, "Consider placement of IPC (IPC should also be considered in patients with failed pleurodesis or symptomatic loculated effusion)". When lung re-expansion is achieved, proceed to "Discussion of relative risks / benefits of IPC vs. pleurodesis vs. combination approaches" and consider "Talc poudrage or talc slurry ± IPC". For "Evidence of IPC-related infection", the pathway directs "Initiation of oral antibiotics based on local sensitivities. Attempt to keep catheter in place"; the footnote notes "there is a low likelihood (2–4%) of indwelling pleural catheter (IPC)–related infection" and that escalation of care "should be made on a case-by-case basis and is recommended if there are any signs/symptoms of worsening infection". A prognostic caution states "Physicians are not great predictors of prognosis" and the "Predicted very short survival" recommendation "should be used as a rough guideline and individualized on a case-by-case basis".

### Therapeutic thoracentesis: the role of ultrasound and pleural manometry [^b3396e00]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Therapeutic thoracentesis is one of the most commonly performed medical procedures. The availability of handheld ultrasound machines has greatly enhanced the evaluation and management of patients with pleural effusions, with advantages including the absence of radiation, ease of use, portability and real-time/dynamic imaging. Pleural manometry refers to the measurement of pleural pressure during thoracentesis. Though described more than 122 years ago, most physicians do not measure pleural pressure, or even consider the role pleural pressures plays in the development of pleural effusions. This review summarizes the relevant data behind the use of ultrasound and manometry and explores their use during therapeutic thoracentesis

Recent Findings

The use of ultrasound has been associated with a higher sensitivity for identifying pleural effusions, avoiding 'near misses' and a lower pneumothorax rate for thoracentesis. Pleural manometry can be used to distinguish patients with lung entrapment from those with trapped lung. Manometry is also able to predict the ability to pleurodesis patients with malignant effusions, and possibly minimize the risk of reexpansion pulmonary edema when large volumes of pleural fluid are removed.

Summary

The use of ultrasound and pleural manometry enhances the understanding of pleural disease and is associated with clinical benefit that will lead to improved patient care.

### Management of malignant pleural effusions. An official ATS / STS / STR clinical practice guideline [^e49d4553]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Management of malignant pleural effusions — The panel made weak recommendations in favor of using ultrasound to guide pleural interventions, not performing pleural interventions in asymptomatic patients with malignant pleural effusion (MPE), using either an indwelling pleural catheter (IPC) or chemical pleurodesis in symptomatic patients with MPE and suspected expandable lung, performing large-volume thoracentesis to assess symptomatic response and lung expansion, using either talc poudrage or talc slurry for chemical pleurodesis, using IPC instead of chemical pleurodesis in patients with nonexpandable lung or failed pleurodesis, and treating IPC-associated infections with antibiotics and not removing the catheter; these recommendations, based on the best available evidence, can guide management of patients with MPE and improve patient outcomes.

### Prospective study to determine the volume of pleural fluid required to diagnose malignancy [^67f8acbb]. Chest (2010). Low credibility.

Background

The optimal volume of pleural fluid to diagnose a malignant effusion is unknown. Our study was designed to demonstrate if a minimum pleural fluid volume (10 mL) is equivalent to a large volume thoracentesis to make a cytopathologic diagnosis of malignancy.

Methods

A total of 121 thoracentesis samples were obtained from 102 patients with suspected or known malignant effusions. Pleural fluid was collected in three aliquots for cytologic examination (10 mL, 60 mL, ≥ 150 mL). The pathologist was blinded to patient identifiers and aliquot volume. Sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value (NPV), and positive predictive value (PPV) were calculated for each volume for the diagnosis of malignancy.

Results

Pleural malignancy was diagnosed in 90 patient encounters (74.4%). For direct smear/cytospin, there was increased sensitivity and NPV for 60 mL (P = 0.0058 and P = 0.045, respectively) and for ≥ 150 mL (P < .001 and P = 0.009, respectively) compared with 10 mL. For combined direct smear/cytospin and cell block preparations, statistical significance for sensitivity and NPV existed only between the 10 mL and ≥ 150 mL specimens (P = 0.0099 and P = 0.033, respectively). No statistical difference existed for specificity or PPV for any aliquot volume.

Conclusions

The sensitivity for diagnosis of pleural malignancy is dependent on the pleural fluid volume extracted during thoracentesis. Volumes of 10 mL do not perform as well as larger volumes. When both direct smear/cytospin and cell block preparations are used, we recommend ≥ 150 mL, whereas when only direct smear/cytospin is used, 60 mL is adequate for the diagnosis a malignant pleural effusion.

### Physiology of breathlessness associated with pleural effusions [^cfabe9a3]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Cardiovascular function

Small or moderate effusions, and their drainage, generally do not cause major hemodynamic changes. Even in mechanically ventilated patients fluid evacuation does not significantly alter blood pressure, cardiac output (CO) or catecholamine dose requirements. Detailed description of the effects of pleural effusion on cardiovascular function is beyond the scope of this article.

Large effusions do not usually reduce CO at rest but can limit its rise during exercise. When saline up to 40 ml/kg was infused into both hemithoraces of dogs, pulmonary artery occlusion pressure and central venous pressure increased in proportion to the pleural fluid added. The CO did not change until a larger volume (40–80 ml/kg) was instilled when the CO dropped significantly and caused death in many animals. The hemodynamic changes of large bilateral effusions in dogs mimic those of pericardial tamponade: elevated intrapericardial pressure, impaired cardiac filling and stroke volume and right ventricular diastolic collapse. Ventricular diastolic collapse can also be seen with large, unilateral effusions and resolves quickly postthoracentesis.

Exercise

Breathlessness in patients with pleural effusions is most prominent during exertion. Only two studies have examined the effect of pleural effusion and thoracentesis on exercise capacity. Both studies showed impairment of baseline exercise capacity in patients with effusions and benefits from thoracentesis.

One study (n = 25) employed the 6MWT and found an average baseline distance of 432 ± 78 m (73% predicted). The other (n = 15) used incremental cardiopulmonary exercise test which revealed a mean maximum oxygen consumption per minute (VO₂max) of only 37% of the predicted values.

The 6MWT distance improved by 15% (63 m) after thoracentesis (1.56 ± 0.70 l). This improvement correlated with increases in ventilatory capacity, but neither correlated with the volume of fluid removed. Breathlessness improved significantly at rest (Borg scores from 2.7 to 1.5) and after exercise (from 5.1 to 2.4), even though oxygenation did not improve.

In the study using cardiopulmonary exercise test, improvements in exercise tolerance, maximum workload and VO 2max following therapeutic thoracentesis (mean 1.6 l removed) were variable. Change in VO 2max postthoracentesis correlated with changes in FEV₁ (r = 0.58), forced vital capacity (r = 0.61) and maximum O₂ pulse (r = 0.78). Again, no correlation with the amount of fluid removed was found.

### Utility and safety of draining pleural effusions in mechanically ventilated patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^6cbe3a77]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Discussion

This systematic review demonstrates that pleural drainage in mechanically ventilated patients is associated with improved oxygenation and a reassuringly low risk of serious peri-procedural complications. There was some data to suggest that routine diagnostic thoracentesis may alter the diagnosis or management of this patient population. However, there were no data on the impact of pleural drainage on duration of mechanical ventilation, our primary outcome of interest. Furthermore, there were no controlled studies of thoracentesis for any clinical or physiological end-point. We conclude that there is no definite evidence to recommend for or against draining pleural effusions in mechanically ventilated patients to improve major clinical outcomes including mortality, duration of mechanical ventilation, or length of ICU or hospital stay.

Studies of the effect of effusion drainage on oxygenation report heterogeneous findings; these differences may be attributable to systematic variation in severity of pre-existing hypoxemia, lung and chest wall compliance, positive-end expiratory pressure settings, pleural effusion volume, and timing of observations. Studies of non-ventilated patients have documented relatively minor improvements in oxygenation after effusion drainage. Small or moderate-sized effusions do not ordinarily cause significant hypoxemia because most (75 to 80%) of the effusion volume is accommodated by the compliant chest wall and flattening of the diaphragm. When chest wall compliance is reduced or the pleural effusion is large, effusions cause hypoxemia by collapsing adjacent lung with resultant physiologic shunt. Drainage of pleural effusions may improve hypoxemia by allowing re-expansion of collapsed lung, which proceeds variably over the subsequent 24 hours and may continue for several weeks. In our review, one study found significant improvement in oxygenation with thoracentesis by pre-selecting patients for study whose hypoxemia was refractory to high positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP). This approach may have identified patients with reduced chest wall or abdominal compliance whose oxygenation would be predicted to improve after effusion drainage. In addition, the application of high PEEP may have promoted rapid recruitment of collapsed lung after effusion drainage.

### Patterns of pleural pressure amplitude and respiratory rate changes during therapeutic thoracentesis [^a4c80378]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Methods

Study design

This prospective, study was performed between January 2016 and August 2016. Consecutive patients with large volume pleural effusion referred to our department to perform therapeutic thoracentesis were enrolled. The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board (KB 105/2012) and registered at ClinicalTrial.gov (NCT02192138). As the study was a part of larger project, the patients signed an informed consent for pleural pressure monitoring during and after therapeutic thoracentesis, as well as for all additional monitoring procedures (e.g. lung function) included in the study protocol.

Patients

The specific inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) age between 18 and 85 years, (2) pleural effusion occupying at least one third of the ipsilateral hemithorax in posteroanterior chest radiograph (CXR), (3) no contraindications for therapeutic thoracentesis, (4) general health condition allowing prolonged procedure of therapeutic thoracentesis.

### A randomized controlled trial of thoracentesis in acute heart failure [^7c59971d]. Circulation (2025). Medium credibility.

There are several possible explanations for the neutral outcome of TAP-IT. The population was elderly, with substantial comorbidities and frailty, which may partly explain the lack of effect of thoracentesis on DAOH. In fact, the 90-day all-cause hospitalization rate was 41%, with heart failure–related hospitalizations accounting for only 14% of the total rehospitalizations. Other trials on decongestive strategies and treatment have shown an effect on short-term outcome measures, such as congestion scores and responses to diuretics, but no effect on rehospitalization, mortality, or length of hospital stay. The potential benefits of thoracentesis could have been reduced if the effusions were too small. Observational studies on the impact of thoracentesis by effusion size in patients with heart failure are small and have shown conflicting results. One study (n = 10) indicated that symptom relief was more common in patients with effusions > 1000 mL, whereas others have found symptom relief and improvement in oxygenation regardless of the volume drained. In TAP-IT, a pragmatic trial, the population reflects patients considered appropriate for thoracentesis on the basis of current clinical practice. The result of TAP-IT reveals that the current population considered for thoracentesis does not seem to benefit from routine referral to thoracentesis and that the efficacy of the procedure in pleural effusion related to heart failure warrants investigation in more selective populations, perhaps on the basis of persisting symptoms, larger effusion volumes, or low tolerance of diuretics or GDMT.

Pleural effusion related to heart failure is associated with increased filling pressures, with a dose–response relationship between increased pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and central venous pressure and the size of pleural effusion. Hence, reducing filling pressures should be the primary treatment target. A likely explanation for the lack of benefit from thoracentesis is that the intervention does not target the increased filling pressures responsible for the pleural effusion. Indeed, in TAP-IT, both groups received similar decongestive therapy and GDMT and demonstrated similar clinical outcomes. This underscores the importance of attention to goal-directed decongestion and fast implementation of GDMT to improve prognosis in patients hospitalized with heart failure.

What Others Are Saying

Several professional societies classify thoracentesis and paracentesis as low-risk procedures. Consequently, they do not recommend routine preprocedural transfusions for thrombocytopenia or coagulopathy.,

Research Priorities

High-quality data acquisition necessitates large-scale enrollment given the low frequency of complications.

Question 6: Should critically ill patients with increased risk of bleeding due to thrombocytopenia or coagulopathy undergoing a bedside lumbar puncture (LP) receive blood products to reverse thrombocytopenia or coagulopathy?

Recommendation 6A: In critically ill patients with increased risk of bleeding due to thrombocytopenia undergoing a bedside LP, we suggest platelet transfusion if platelets counts are 40–50 × 10⁹/L or lower (Conditional Recommendation, Very Low Certainty of Evidence)

Recommendation 6B: In critically ill patients with increased risk of bleeding due to coagulopathy undergoing a bedside lumbar puncture, we suggest FFP transfusion to target INR 1.5–2 before the procedure (Conditional recommendation, very low certainty of evidence)

### Patterns of pleural pressure amplitude and respiratory rate changes during therapeutic thoracentesis [^a6ed2e1d]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Large volume pleural effusion leads to an increase in pleural pressure, negatively affects lung volumes and induces clinical symptoms (e.g. dyspnea and cough). Conversely, therapeutic thoracentesis usually results in a decrease in pleural pressure and has beneficial effects on pulmonary function. Although the number of thoracenteses performed in the USA is reported between 127,000 and 173,000 procedures per year, some physiological aspects of pleural fluid removal have not been adequately studied. This is partly because there is no universal and commonly accepted animal model for studying pleural pathophysiology. The relationship between pleural fluid volume and pulmonary function has been evaluated in several human studies. These studies showed that the increase in forced expiratory volume at first second (FEV 1) and forced vital capacity (FVC) after therapeutic thoracentesis approximates 20–30% of the withdrawn pleural fluid volume. Changes in spirometric parameters in patients undergoing therapeutic thoracentesis were related to pleural pressure (Ppl). In a study by Light et al. higher post-thoracentesis Ppl and smaller Ppl decrease after pleural fluid removal were associated with a more significant improvement in FVC.

Some other studies focused on the effect of therapeutic thoracentesis on blood gases. A study by Brandstetter and Cohen showed that PaO 2 decreases significantly early after therapeutic thoracentesis and returns to pre-thoracentesis value after 24 h. Different results were reported in later studies. Perpina et al. found a significant increase in PaO 2 after pleural fluid removal reaching a maximum at 24 h, while Agusti et al. reported no significant effect of therapeutic thoracentesis on blood gases. Changes in blood gases after therapeutic thoracentesis were also studied in relation to pleural pressure and pleural elastance. Chen et al. reported a significantly larger increase in PaO 2 and PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio in patients with normal pleural elastance (PE < 14 cmH₂O/L) compared to patients with high (> 14 cmH₂O/L) pleural elastance.

### Chemical pleurodesis-a review of mechanisms involved in pleural space obliteration [^3137cc21]. Respiratory Research (2019). Medium credibility.

The two major clinical conditions that can be treated with chemical pleurodesis are recurrent pleural effusion and recurrent spontaneous pneumothorax. The concept of applying chemical pleurodesis in these two entities is slightly different. In patients with recurrent pleural effusion, pleurodesis is a symptomatic treatment that prevents dyspnea related to relatively rapid reaccumulation of pleural fluid after its earlier withdrawal. Thus, the beneficial effect of pleurodesis in patients with pleural effusion can be observed within weeks or months after the procedure. In recurrent spontaneous pneumothorax, pleurodesis has a more delayed effect (months, years), as it is not applied to treat the current pneumothorax episode, but it is aimed to prevent future pneumothorax recurrences.

Symptomatic treatment of recurrent pleural effusion is by far the most common indication for pleurodesis. Though it mainly refers to malignant pleural effusion (MPE), chemical pleurodesis can also be applied in patients with other underlying diseases. In developed countries, MPE is probably the third leading cause of pleural effusion, with approximately 200,000 new cases diagnosed each year in the United States. Almost 75% of all MPEs are associated with three common malignancies: lung cancer, breast cancer and lymphoma. According to literature data as many as 30% of lung cancer patients and 7–11% of breast cancer patients develop pleural effusion. Furthermore, it is estimated that malignant pleural effusion may occur in nearly 50% of all patients with metastatic cancers. Since MPE usually reflects advanced (metastatic) disease, curative treatment is only occasionally possible and effective. Thus, although chemical pleurodesis is a palliative treatment that should be applied only in patients who cannot be offered effective causative treatment, or in those in whom causal treatment was found to be ineffective, the number of patients who require symptomatic treatment due to dyspnea related to MPE is substantial. The number of pleurodeses performed in the United States approximates 100,000 per year. The treatment strategy in patients with symptomatic MPE is complex but pleural interventions play a pivotal role. The choice of therapeutic procedure should be based on several determinants, including life expectancy and patient preferences. In terms of prognosis in patients with MPE the first validated prognostic scores to predict survival in patients with MPE has been developed in recent years, and they seems to be very helpful in selecting patients who might benefit from pleurodesis. Large volume therapeutic thoracentesis may bring an immediate therapeutic effect but it does not prevent pleural fluid reaccumulation. Therefore, repeated therapeutic thoracenteses might be recommended only for patients with a slow rate of pleural fluid reaccumulation (> 1 month), patients with a short-expected survival time (< 3 months), and some patients who will undergo chemotherapy or targeted therapy which is expected to be effective against reaccumulation of pleural effusion, like in small cell lung cancer, lymphoma, or adenocarcinoma with EGFR mutation. In the remaining patients, procedures that reduce the future risk of pleural effusion recurrence should be considered, with chemical pleurodesis being the major therapeutic option. It must be emphasized, however, that not all patients with recurrent malignant pleural effusion are suitable candidates for chemical pleurodesis. The two major contraindications to the procedure are an unexpandable lung ("trapped lung") and inability to remove pleural fluid, e.g. due to multiple loculations. This is because the formation of effective pleural adhesions after administration of sclerosing agent requires a close and direct contact between the parietal and visceral pleura. Thus, an effective withdrawal of pleural effusion and the ability of the lung to reexpand are important prerequisites for efficient pleurodesis. The overall effectiveness of chemical pleurodesis in prevention of reaccumulation of MPE ranges between 41.3 and 100% and depends on different factors, including cancer type, extension of pleural involvement and the sclerosant used for pleurodesis. Another increasingly popular therapeutic option that might also be offered to patients with unexpandable lung is chest tube insertion to permanently drain the pleural fluid (indwelling or tunneled pleural catheter, IPC). Pleuro-peritoneal or pleuro-venal shunts are hardly ever used anymore, because of the invasive character of the procedure and the high complication rate. With IPC, symptomatic relief can be achieved in 70–94.2% patients with MPE. Moreover, it has been shown that drainage of the pleural cavity may lead to spontaneous pleurodesis.

### Thoracentesis outcomes: a 12-year experience [^62133d17]. Thorax (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Despite a lack of evidence in the literature, several assumptions exist about the safety of thoracentesis in clinical guidelines and practice patterns. We aimed to evaluate specific demographic and clinical factors that have been commonly associated with complications such as iatrogenic pneumothorax, re-expansion pulmonary oedema (REPE) and bleeding.

Methods

We performed a cohort study of inpatients who underwent thoracenteses at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center (CSMC) from August 2001 to October 2013. Data were collected prospectively including information on volume of fluid removed, procedure side, whether the patient was on positive pressure ventilation, number of needle passes and supine positioning. Iatrogenic pneumothorax, REPE and bleeding were tracked for 24h after the procedure or until a clinical question was reconciled. Demographic and clinical characteristics were obtained through query of electronic medical records.

Results

CSMC performed 9320 inpatient thoracenteses on 4618 patients during the study period. There were 57 (0.61%) iatrogenic pneumothoraces, 10 (0.01%) incidents of REPE and 17 (0.18%) bleeding episodes. Iatrogenic pneumothorax was significantly associated with removal of > 1500mL fluid (p < 0.0001), unilateral procedures (p = 0.001) and more than one needle pass through the skin (p = 0.001). For every 1mL of fluid removed there was a 0.18% increased risk of REPE (95% CI 0.09% to 0.26%). There were no significant associations between bleeding and demographic or clinical variables including International Normalised Ratio, partial thromboplastin time and platelet counts.

Conclusions

Our series of thoracenteses had a very low complication rate. Current clinical guidelines and practice patterns may not reflect evidence-based best practices.

### Safe and effective bedside thoracentesis: a review of the evidence for practicing clinicians [^15a6805d]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Physicians often care for patients with pleural effusion, a condition that requires thoracentesis for evaluation and treatment. We aim to identify the most recent advances related to safe and effective performance of thoracentesis.

Methods

We performed a narrative review with a systematic search of the literature. Two authors independently reviewed search results and selected studies based on relevance to thoracentesis; disagreements were resolved by consensus. Articles were categorized as those related to the pre-, intra- and postprocedural aspects of thoracentesis.

Results

Sixty relevant studies were identified and included. Pre-procedural topics included methods for physician training and maintenance of skills, such as simulation with direct observation. Additionally, pre-procedural topics included the finding that moderate coagulopathies (international normalized ratio less than 3 or a platelet count greater than 25,000/μL) and mechanical ventilation did not increase risk of postprocedural complications. Intraprocedurally, ultrasound use was associated with lower risk of pneumothorax, while pleural manometry can identify a nonexpanding lung and may help reduce risk of re-expansion pulmonary edema. Postprocedurally, studies indicate that routine chest X-ray is unwarranted, because bedside ultrasound can identify pneumothorax.

Conclusions

While the performance of thoracentesis is not without risk, clinicians can incorporate recent advances into practice to mitigate patient harm and improve effectiveness. Journal of Hospital Medicine 2017;12:266–276.

### Incidence and risk factors for re-expansion pulmonary oedema following medical thoracoscopy [^703a3bc8]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2025). High credibility.

These lead on to the finding that larger volume of pleural fluid removed during MT was a significant predictor of RPO in our study population, which mirrors the findings of RPO following thoracentesis or chest drainage. In patients undergoing chest drainage for tension pneumothorax, the incidence of RPO has been reported to be as high as 44.4% in one study. Although some evidence suggests that large volume pleural aspirations for pleural effusions can be performed safely with a low risk of RPO, this may not be directly applicable to MT, where pleural fluid drainage rates are typically more rapid and challenging to perform in a controlled manner, particularly with massive pleural effusions. Moreover, because pleural fluid is replaced by air during MT, a large bore chest drain is usually inserted to facilitate lung re-expansion; however, the subsequent rate of air drainage is difficult to predict or regulate and may further contribute to RPO risk. It is, therefore, plausible that the combination of rapid removal of a large volume or air or fluid — particularly in cases of sizeable pneumothoraces or pleural effusion treated with ME — would increase the risk of RPO.

### Complications of thoracentesis: incidence, risk factors, and strategies for prevention [^912e3cf0]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Although thoracentesis is generally considered safe, procedural complications are associated with increased morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs. In this article, we review the risk factors and prevention of the most common complications of thoracentesis including pneumothorax, bleeding (chest wall hematoma and hemothorax), and re-expansion pulmonary edema.

Recent Findings

Recent data support the importance of operator expertise and the use of ultrasound in reducing the risk of iatrogenic pneumothorax. Although coagulopathy or thrombocytopenia and the use of anticoagulant or antiplatelet medications have traditionally been viewed as contraindications to thoracentesis, new evidence suggests that patients may be able to safely undergo thoracentesis without treating their bleeding risk. Re-expansion pulmonary edema, a rare complication of thoracentesis, is felt to result in part from the generation of excessively negative pleural pressure. When and how to monitor changes in pleural pressure during thoracentesis remains a focus of ongoing study.

Summary

Major complications of thoracentesis are uncommon. Clinician awareness of risk factors for procedural complications and familiarity with strategies that improve outcomes are essential components for safely performing thoracentesis.

### Physiology of breathlessness associated with pleural effusions [^046a8b6e]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

FIGURE 1
Expiratory flow-volume loops before (red) and 4 h after (blue) thoracocentesis of 1.3 l in a 62-year-old man with large malignant right pleural effusion. Thoracocentesis resulted in increases in vital capacity, total lung capacity and peak expiratory flow, but they remain severely reduced due to underlying pulmonary and pleural disease. FVC, forced vital capacity.

A study of 129 acute respiratory distress syndrome patients found that small (median 287 ml) pleural effusions were associated with greater increases in thoracic cage volume than reduction in lung volume and had no significant effects on respiratory mechanics. Two studies of mechanically ventilated patients with acute respiratory failure showed that thoracentesis improved compliance and respiratory resistance within 24 h. However, the improvement in respiratory compliance, respiratory resistance, elastic lung recoil and intrinsic positive end-expiratory pressure may not be apparent within the initial 2 h after thoracentesis. Thoracentesis does not appear to significantly alter the diffusing capacity of lung for carbon monoxide specific airway conductance or the physiological dead space, tidal volume ratio.

Taken together these data suggest that symptomatic benefits of pleural drainage may result from deflation of the thoracic cage and associated improvements in inspiratory muscle function.

Pleural pressure

In health, Ppl at FRC is determined by the balance of elastic recoil pressures of the lung and chest wall, and is usually subatmospheric (−3 to −5 cmH₂O). In mechanically ventilated pigs with an artificially created pleural effusion, the Ppl progressively increases toward the most dependent part of the effusion. However, Ppl is highly variable in patients with pleural effusions and may be either increased or reduced. In a study of 52 patients with pleural effusions, Light et al. found that Ppl ranged from −21 to +8 cmH₂O. This difference may be explained by concurrent pulmonary pathologies in patients. Ppl can be reduced (< −5 cmH₂O) particularly in patients with a trapped lung.

### Incidence and risk factors for re-expansion pulmonary oedema following medical thoracoscopy [^872041b4]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2025). High credibility.

While RPO following drainage of pneumothorax or pleural effusions is well recognised, its occurrence after MT is rarely reported.RPO with MT has traditionally been considered uncommon, as air entrainment into the pleural space during fluid removal is thought to mitigate rapid lung re-expansion. Consequently, RPO is often not emphasised as a potential life-threatening complication of MT, even in international guidelines. Determining its true incidence is also challenging because RPO may present only radiologically without overt clinical manifestations.

In our cohort, more than half of the patients had large effusions (> 50% hemithorax), and up to 20% had at least 2 L of pleural fluid drained during MT — factors that may account for the higher observed incidence of RPO in our study. Comparable findings have been reported elsewhere: in a study involving 501 thoracoscopy and VATS procedures, RPO occurred in 11 (2.2%) patients, all of whom had large pleural fluid drainage volumes ranging from 3200 mL to 5000 mL. In contrast, studies of VATS performed primarily for diagnostic procedures where large effusions are far less common, report a much lower incidence of RPO. These contrasting patterns are also observed with pleural aspirations. Most studies of pleural fluid drainage describe RPO rates of less than 1%. The largest series involving over 9000 thoracenteses reported an RPO incidence of only 0.01% — however, only 8% of all procedures involved drainage volumes exceeding 1.5 L. Conversely, in a prospective study of 185 patients undergoing large volume thoracentesis, the risk was notably higher, with clinical and radiological RPO rates of 0.5% and 2.2%, respectively. Taken together, these data underscore how patient selection and clinical characteristics significantly influence the risk of RPO. Our findings suggest that RPO may not be as rare a complication of MT as previously assumed, particularly in patients with large symptomatic pleural effusions.

### Pleural manometry in patients with pleural diseases-the usefulness in clinical practice [^6f29420d]. Respiratory Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Although pleural manometry is a relatively simple medical procedure it is only occasionally used to follow pleural pressure (Ppl) changes during a therapeutic thoracentesis and pneumothorax drainage. As some studies showed that pleural pressure monitoring might be associated with significant advantages, pleural manometry has been increasingly evaluated in the last decade. The major clinical applications of pleural pressure measurements include: the prevention of complications associated with large volume thoracentesis, diagnosis and differentiation between various types of an unexpandable lung and a possible prediction of the efficacy of chest tube drainage in patients with spontaneous pneumothorax. It is well known that the therapeutic thoracentesis might be complicated by cough, chest discomfort, and rarely, by a life threatening condition called reexpansion pulmonary edema (RPE). The serious adverse events of thoracentesis are related to pleural pressure drop rather than to the volume of removed pleural effusion. The use of pleural manometry during pleural fluid withdrawal enables the evaluation of the relationship between withdrawn pleural fluid volume, pleural pressure changes and procedure related complications. Pleural pressure measurement is also an important tool to study the different mechanism of pneumothorax complicating the thoracentesis. Pleural manometry is critical for measurement of pleural elastance, diagnosis of an unexpandable lung and differentiation between trapped lung and lung entrapment. This usually has significant clinical implications in terms of further management of patients with pleural effusion. The paper is a comprehensive review presenting different aspects of pleural pressure measurement in clinical practice.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for ascites, more specifically with respect to therapeutic paracentesis, EASL 2018 guidelines recommend to perform large-volume paracentesis, removing ascites completely in a single session, as first-line therapy in patients with large ascites (grade 3 ascites), followed by plasma volume expansion to prevent post-paracentesis circulatory dysfunction.

### Impact of pleural manometry on the development of chest discomfort during thoracentesis: a symptom-based study [^53934193]. Journal of Bronchology & Interventional Pulmonology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Routine manometry is recommended to prevent complications during therapeutic thoracentesis, but has not definitively been shown to prevent pneumothorax or reexpansion pulmonary edema. As chest discomfort correlates with negative pleural pressures, we aimed to determine whether the use of manometry could anticipate the development of chest discomfort during therapeutic thoracentesis.

Methods

A retrospective chart review of 214 consecutive adults who underwent outpatient therapeutic thoracentesis at our institution between January 1, 2011 and June 30, 2013 was performed. We compared preprocedural to postprocedural discomfort (using a linear analog scale from 0 to 10) in patients undergoing thoracentesis with or without manometry. We used a multivariate model to adjust for possible confounders. Changes of dyspnea scores were also analyzed.

Results

Manometry was performed in 82/214 patients (38%). On univariate and multivariate analyses, neither the change in chest discomfort nor dyspnea scores was significantly different in the manometry versus the control group (P = 0.12 and 0.24, respectively). Similar results were also found in the subgroup of large-volume thoracentesis (P = 0.32 for discomfort, P = 1.0 for dyspnea).

Conclusions

In our retrospective study, the use of manometry did not appear to anticipate the development of chest discomfort during therapeutic thoracentesis. Prospective studies are needed to confirm these findings.

### Collection and handling of thoracic small biopsy and cytology specimens for ancillary studies: guideline from the college of American pathologists in collaboration with the American College of Chest Physicians, Association for Molecular Pathology, American society of cytopathology, American Thoracic Society, pulmonary pathology society, Papanicolaou society of cytopathology, Society of Interventional Radiology, and Society of Thoracic Radiology [^af14a1a9]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Pleural effusion cytology — submitted volume evidence and practice feedback are as follows: No standardized volume requirements exist for cytologic evaluation of effusions, and study findings are mixed across volumes. In one prospective series of 50 patients comparing 10 mL with 50 mL, carcinoma was identified in 7 patients with 100% agreement and the authors determined that 10 mL is a sufficient volume. Another prospective review using 10 mL, 60 mL, and greater than or equal to 150 mL from 121 thoracenteses (90 malignancies) noted volume-dependent sensitivity; when only smears were evaluated, 60 mL was adequate and the authors recommended a minimum of 50 to 60 mL. A large analysis of 2155 pleural effusions concluded that sensitivity did not improve above 50 mL and that the minimum required volume was between 25 and 50 mL of fluid. A study of 74 samples divided into 25 mL, 50 mL, and 150 mL noted an increase in sensitivity with increasing volume, but the difference was not statistically significant. In 2540 effusion specimens (malignant fraction 20.1%) ranging from 5 mL to greater than 900 mL, the malignant fraction improved with increasing volume but was independent once it exceeded 75 mL. The guideline notes that although a volume as low as 10 mL of a truly cellular sample can be adequate for morphologic evaluation, it could potentially be insufficient for further testing. During open comment, 74.88% (n = 161) agreed, 15.35% (n = 33) disagreed, and 9.77% (n = 21) indicated the statement did not pertain to their area; many suggested a minimum volume of 50–100 mL, while the majority commented that the volume submitted should be adequate to allow proper diagnosis and additional ancillary testing including IHC and molecular profiling.

### Physiology of breathlessness associated with pleural effusions [^bb732be4]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

KNOWLEDGE GAP AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS

Pleural effusion is common and therapeutic drainages are performed worldwide everyday despite there being limited understanding of the mechanism of breathlessness and no accurate predictors to guide patient selection.

Definitive studies to examine the cause of breathlessness in pleural effusion are challenging to perform. Prior attempts have been limited by small and markedly heterogeneous patient cohorts that include a wide range of pleural effusions of different causes, size and the acuity of accumulation in patients of varying severity of breathlessness/hypoxemia and concurrent cardiorespiratory diseases. Variations in study protocols and endpoints also make comparisons difficult. For example, different assessment times after drainage (ranging from immediately to 48 h postdrainage) complicate result interpretation. Differences in fluid volume removed further confound the results.

Defining the optimal tool to assess breathlessness in pleural effusion must be a priority. Prospective studies to identify key factors governing breathlessness with pleural effusions and to develop predictors of improvement following pleural drainage are needed. Ideally a comprehensive approach incorporating clinical, physiological and radiological parameters in a large unbiased patient population should be employed.

The ability to select and limit pleural interventions to patients who are likely to have symptomatic benefits from fluid drainage would represent a major advance in pleural medicine.

### Pre-EDIT: protocol for a randomised feasibility trial of elastance-directed intrapleural catheter or talc pleurodesis (EDIT) in malignant pleural effusion [^31bd6f77]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2018). Medium credibility.

Therefore, in the current pre-EDIT trial, we will use a novel definition of NEL, based on a rolling average of P EL recording over the preceding 250 mL fluid removed (P EL250), during a large volume pleural aspiration. The aspiration volume will only be limited by symptoms, a drop in IPP below previously reported safety thresholds or a target pleural effusion depth, based on repeated sonographic measurements (see Methods and analysis section for further detail). IPP pressures used to derive P EL will be consistently measured at end-expiration. NEL will be defined by a maximum P EL250 ≥ 14.5 cm H₂O/L (the previously reported upper limit of the normal range for P EL)occurring at any point during large volume aspiration. This definition aims to detect NEL at the earliest possible opportunity, including in patients with biphasic NEL, while preserving specificity.

Delivery of elastance-directed management and safety considerations

By definition, the EDIT pathway requires an additional large volume thoracentesis prior to allocation to TP or IPC. If the allocated procedure cannot be delivered promptly, ideally on the same day, this offsets any pathway efficiency gained through detection of NEL. However, placement of any form of Seldinger drain may be technically challenging after removal of the majority of the effusion during P EL assessment. Therefore, within the EDIT protocol, thoracic ultrasound (TUS) images will be acquired regularly during aspiration, and the procedure terminated once a minimum safe depth of effusion has been reached (see Methods and analysis section for further details). The protocol also allows that, if required, a 'Boutin-type' needle can employed for pneumothorax induction to ensure safe placement of P EL -allocated IPC or TP. This is regularly practised at level II thoracoscopy centres, including our own, when no, or minimal, pleural fluid is present at local anaesthetic thoracoscopy. However, if the current study finds that this is frequently required to deliver EDIT management, this may impact on the feasibility of subsequent multicentre phase III trial and any subsequent clinical deployment.

### Thoracentesis and the risks for bleeding: a new era [^cb673efe]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Thoracentesis is a commonly performed procedure throughout the world. Convention dictates that patients should have laboratory values such as international normalized ratio (INR) and platelets corrected or medications that affect bleeding withheld prior to performing this procedure. By transfusing blood products or withholding medications, patients are exposed to risks that are different than but equally if not more significant than the risk of hemothorax from thoracentesis. This review highlights recent studies that suggest the parameters of performing thoracentesis should be less stringent than traditionally thought.

Recent Findings

Although the safety of thoracentesis has improved with the use of ultrasound and other advancements, the number of patients on new medications that exert an influence on bleeding and those who have physiologic coagulation abnormalities continues to grow. Despite a 1991 study demonstrating the safety of thoracentesis in patients with an abnormal INR or low platelet count, transfusion of blood products to normalize laboratory values is commonplace. A number of studies within the past year address the safety of thoracentesis amidst INR and platelet abnormalities and in patients taking antiplatelet or other medications that affect a patient's bleeding potential.

Summary

Although large randomized studies do not exist, recent literature suggests that it is time to reevaluate the need to correct INR and platelet counts or to transfuse blood products or withhold medications prior to thoracentesis in patients felt to have a risk of possible bleeding.

### Re-expansion pulmonary oedema: a novel emergency therapeutic option [^4a18a6ca]. BMJ Case Reports (2016). Medium credibility.

Re-expansion pulmonary oedema (REPO) is a rare complication of pleural fluid thoracocentesis and has been associated with a high mortality rate. There is limited evidence to inform on its most effective management. We present two cases of large volume thoracocentesis resulting in acute respiratory decompensation that was treated by reintroducing the drained pleural fluid back into the pleural cavity. We also present a review of the literature specifically assessing the reported incidence rate of REPO after pleural fluid drainage. In both of our cases, symptoms and signs of respiratory instability were promptly reversed on reintroduction of the drained pleural fluid into the patient's pleural space-a therapy we have termed 'rapid pleural space re-expansion'. This was not associated with any short-term adverse outcomes. The occurrence of REPO is a rare event with most cohort studies reporting an incidence of between 0% and 1%.

### Improved heart hemodynamics after draining large-volume pleural effusion: a prospective cohort study [^f38aa0ee]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Methods

This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Beijing Chaoyang Hospital and conducted in agreement with the Helsinki II declaration. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants. Approval was obtained from the Beijing Chao-Yang Hospital Institutional Review Board (approval number: 2016–2–19–9), and the clinical trial number is NCT02548221.

Subjects

We assessed the eligibility of all PE patients who visit the department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine in Beijing Chaoyang Hospital and required pleural drainage for the treatment of breathlessness.

Inclusion criteria: 1. Subjects with symptomatic PE secondary to non-cardiac etiology who required pleural drainage as part of standard clinical management of the effusion. 2. No drainage was performed within 1 month before admission. 3. Written informed consent was obtained.

Exclusion criteria: 1) Subjects with physical weakness making drainage difficult to endure; 2) Subjects who had undergone drainage within 1 month before admission; 3) We excluded subjectswith pericardial effusion because the pericardial effusion may have confounded our results.

Drainage procedure

All drainage procedures were performed by the same trained pulmonologist using standard protocol. Thoracentesis, indwelling pleural catheters, or medical thoracoscopy was chosen for pleural opening to perform large-volume drainage. Thoracentesis was performed with echocardiographic evaluation immediately after drainage, and a second echocardiographic examination was performed 24 h later. The medical thoracoscopy procedure and equipment have been described previously. Pleural biopsies were collected for diagnostic confirmation of the cause of the PE, and we recorded the PE characteristics, including the volume and appearance, etiology and details of any prior pleural procedures.

### Management of malignant pleural effusions. An official ATS / STS / STR clinical practice guideline [^e34e87bb]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Ultrasound guidance for pleural interventions in malignant pleural effusion (MPE) is conditionally supported; in patients with known or suspected MPE, we suggest that ultrasound imaging be used to guide pleural interventions (conditional recommendation, very low confidence in estimate of effects). Supporting data include a large retrospective cohort that reviewed 62,261 thoracenteses reporting an overall pneumothorax risk of 2.7% and a 19% reduction with ultrasound (odds ratio = 0.81, 95% CI = 0.74–0.90), and that 3.4% of pneumothoraces required chest tube placement. In malignant effusions specifically, ultrasound guidance reduced pneumothorax after thoracentesis (1.0% vs. 8.9%, relative risk [RR] = 0.10, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.03–0.37), with no chest tubes in the ultrasound group compared with three (2.2%) without image guidance (95% CI not estimable). The panel agrees that ultrasound guidance, which has no significant harms associated with its usage, has an important benefit of reducing pneumothorax rates, and pneumothorax was associated with a significantly longer length of hospital stay and total patient hospitalization cost.

### Ultrasound in the diagnosis and management of pleural effusions [^85ec60dc]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

We review the literature on the use of point-of-care ultrasound to evaluate and manage pleural effusions. Point-of-care ultrasound is more sensitive than physical exam and chest radiography to detect pleural effusions, and avoids many negative aspects of computerized tomography. Additionally, point-of-care ultrasound can assess pleural fluid volume and character, revealing possible underlying pathologies and guiding management. Thoracentesis performed with ultrasound guidance has lower risk of pneumothorax and bleeding complications. Future research should focus on the clinical effectiveness of point-of-care ultrasound in the routine management of pleural effusions and how new technologies may expand its clinical utility.

Pleural effusion cytology — specimen volume considerations — Prospective and retrospective studies report variable volume needs: in one series "Carcinoma was identified in 7 patients with 100% agreement between the 2 volumes and the authors determined that 10 mL is a sufficient volume", whereas another study noted volume dependence and "recommended a minimum of 50 to 60 mL", and a large cohort "concluded that the sensitivity did not improve with volumes above 50 mL and that the minimum required volume was between 25 and 50 mL of fluid", while another analysis found malignant fraction became volume-independent "once it exceeded 75 mL". The guideline emphasizes "there is no minimum volume in which malignant cells could not be detected" but low volumes "carries a risk of producing nondiagnostic, atypical or falsely benign diagnosis", and that "although a volume as low as 10 mL of a truly cellular sample can be adequate for morphologic evaluation, it could potentially be insufficient for further testing". Overall, "it is not possible to recommend a minimum or maximum volume", although "the larger the volume submitted to the laboratory the more adequate the specimen would be", and triage should be coordinated with the laboratory. During the open comment period "there were 215 respondents, of whom 74.88% (n = 161) agreed, 15.35% (n = 33) respondents disagreed, and 9.77% (n = 21) indicated the statement did not pertain to their area of expertise or practice", and "Many suggested a minimum volume of 50–100 mL".

### Safety and tolerability of vacuum versus manual drainage during thoracentesis: a randomized trial [^8bb47d2d]. Journal of Bronchology & Interventional Pulmonology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Pleural effusions may be aspirated manually or via vacuum during thoracentesis. This study compares the safety, pain level, and time involved in these techniques.

Methods

We randomized 100 patients receiving ultrasound-guided unilateral thoracentesis in an academic medical center from December 2015 through September 2017 to either vacuum or manual drainage. Without using pleural manometry, the effusion was drained completely or until the development of refractory symptoms. Measurements included self-reported pain before and during the procedure (from 0 to 10), time for completion of drainage, and volume removed. Primary outcomes were rates of all-cause complications and of early termination of the procedure with secondary outcomes of change in pain score, drainage time, volume removed, and inverse rate of removal.

Results

Patient characteristics in the manual (n = 49) and vacuum (n = 51) groups were similar. Rate of all-cause complications was higher in the vacuum group (5 vs. 0; P = 0.03): pneumothorax (n = 3), surgically treated hemothorax with subsequent death (n = 1) and reexpansion pulmonary edema causing respiratory failure (n = 1), as was rate of early termination (8 vs. 1; P = 0.018). The vacuum group exhibited greater pain during drainage (P < 0.05), shorter drainage time (P < 0.01), no association with volume removed (P > 0.05), and lower inverse rate of removal (P ≤ 0.01).

Conclusion

Despite requiring less time, vacuum aspiration during thoracentesis was associated with higher rates of complication and of early termination of the procedure and greater pain. Although larger studies are needed, this pilot study suggests that manual aspiration provides greater safety and patient comfort.

Statistical analysis

Comparisons were performed using Wilcoxon's test according to the distribution of the data. We used Pearson's χ 2 test to test for differences in distribution of categorical variables between groups with PE on different sides of the thorax. Differences in parameters when comparing data immediately after thoracentesis or 24 h after thoracentesis with baseline were assessed using Wilcoxon's test. To explore whether the parameter was maintained, enhanced, or lost 24 h after drainage, we compared data from immediately after drainage with the 24-h data using Wilcoxon's test (paired difference test). To test for correlations among variables, we used Spearman's correlation test, and we created a scatter plot to demonstrate the significant correlations. All P -values were two-sided, and P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. All statistical analyses were performed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS 13.0, Chicago, IL).

### EASL clinical practice guidelines for the management of patients with decompensated cirrhosis [^0619503e]. Journal of Hepatology (2018). Medium credibility.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for ascites, more specifically with respect to therapeutic paracentesis, EASL 2018 guidelines recommend to administer albumin for plasma volume expansion in patients undergoing large-volume paracentesis of < 5 L of ascites, although the risk of developing post-paracentesis circulatory dysfunction is low.

### The rate of pleural fluid drainage as a criterion for the timing of chest tube removal: theoretical and practical considerations [^564d16ab]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Clinicians place chest tubes approximately 1 million times each year in the United States, but little information is available to guide their management. Specifically, use of the rate of pleural fluid drainage as a criterion for tube removal is not standardized. Absent such tubes, pleural fluid drains primarily through parietal pleural lymphatics at rates approaching 500 mL of fluid per day or more for each hemithorax. Early removal of tubes does not appear to be harmful. A noninferiority randomized trial currently in progress comparing removal without considering the drainage rate to a conservative threshold (2 mL/kg body weight in 24 hours) may better inform tube management.

### Recommendations on the use of ultrasound guidance for adult thoracentesis: a position statement of the Society of Hospital Medicine [^8ff3eef1]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Executive Summary: 1) We recommend that ultrasound should be used to guide thoracentesis to reduce the risk of complications, the most common being pneumothorax. 2) We recommend that ultrasound guidance should be used to increase the success rate of thoracentesis. 3) We recommend that ultrasound-guided thoracentesis should be performed or closely supervised by experienced operators. 4) We suggest that ultrasound guidance be used to reduce the risk of complications from thoracentesis in mechanically ventilated patients. 5) We recommend that ultrasound should be used to identify the chest wall, pleura, diaphragm, lung, and subdiaphragmatic organs throughout the respiratory cycle before selecting a needle insertion site. 6) We recommend that ultrasound should be used to detect the presence or absence of an effusion and approximate the volume of pleural fluid to guide clinical decision-making. 7) We recommend that ultrasound should be used to detect complex sonographic features, such as septations, to guide clinical decision-making regarding the timing and method of pleural drainage. 8) We suggest that ultrasound be used to measure the depth from the skin surface to the parietal pleura to help select an appropriate length needle and determine the maximum needle insertion depth. 9) We suggest that ultrasound be used to evaluate normal lung sliding pre- and postprocedure to rule out pneumothorax. 10) We suggest avoiding delay or interval change in patient position from the time of marking the needle insertion site to performing the thoracentesis. 11) We recommend against performing routine postprocedure chest radiographs in patients who have undergone thoracentesis successfully with ultrasound guidance and are asymptomatic with normal lung sliding postprocedure. 12) We recommend that novices who use ultrasound guidance for thoracentesis should receive focused training in lung and pleural ultrasonography and hands-on practice in procedural technique. 13) We suggest that novices undergo simulation-based training prior to performing ultrasound-guided thoracentesis on patients. 14) Learning curves for novices to become competent in lung ultrasound and ultrasound-guided thoracentesis are not completely understood, and we recommend that training should be tailored to the skill acquisition of the learner and the resources of the institution.

### Thoracic ultrasound for pleural effusion in the intensive care unit: a narrative review from diagnosis to treatment [^971f4519]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

Pleural effusion (PLEFF), mostly caused by volume overload, congestive heart failure, and pleuropulmonary infection, is a common condition in critical care patients. Thoracic ultrasound (TUS) helps clinicians not only to visualize pleural effusion, but also to distinguish between the different types. Furthermore, TUS is essential during thoracentesis and chest tube drainage as it increases safety and decreases life-threatening complications. It is crucial not only during needle or tube drainage insertion, but also to monitor the volume of the drained PLEFF. Moreover, TUS can help diagnose co-existing lung diseases, often with a higher specificity and sensitivity than chest radiography and without the need for X-ray exposure. We review data regarding the diagnosis and management of pleural effusion, paying particular attention to the impact of ultrasound. Technical data concerning thoracentesis and chest tube drainage are also provided.

### Normal volume and cellular contents of pleural fluid [^0e7aab90]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

The pleural space in healthy humans was thought to contain a few milliliters of fluid, based on extrapolation from animal studies. However, because of the obvious technical difficulties in atraumatically retrieving such a small volume of fluid, the exact volume and cellular content of human pleural fluid has not been known. Development of a minimally invasive pleural lavage technique has allowed, for the first time, the measurement of volume and cellular content of the pleural fluid in healthy humans.

### Treatment of pleural mesothelioma: ASCO guideline update [^5e6ce145]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2025). High credibility.

Table 2 — diagnosis: Clinicians should perform an initial thoracentesis when patients present with symptomatic pleural effusions and send pleural fluid for cytologic examination for initial assessment for possible mesothelioma. In patients for whom antineoplastic treatment is planned, it is strongly recommended that a thoracoscopic biopsy should be performed. When performing a thoracoscopic biopsy, the minimal number of incisions (two or fewer) is recommended and should ideally be placed in areas that would be used for subsequent definitive resection in order to avoid tumor implantation into the chest wall. In patients with suspected mesothelioma in whom treatment is planned, an open pleural biopsy should be performed if the extent of tumor prevents a thoracoscopic approach; the smallest incision possible is encouraged (generally 6 cm or less is recommended). In patients who are not candidates for thoracoscopic biopsy or open pleural biopsy, who also have a nondiagnostic thoracentesis or do not have a pleural effusion, clinicians should perform a core needle biopsy of accessible lesion.

### Incidence and risk factors for re-expansion pulmonary oedema following medical thoracoscopy [^8b1f371f]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2025). High credibility.

There are limitations to our study. First, it was conducted at a single centre, with patient characteristics (eg, higher proportion of TB pleuritis) that may not be representative of other populations. Second, therapeutic pleural aspirations was also performed in 46 patients within 1–3 days prior to thoracoscopy for large symptomatic pleural effusions. Although the proportion of such patients was higher among those who developed radiological RPO — making it unlikely to alter our conclusions — we evaluated pleural fluid volume based only on that drained during MT, excluding volumes removed from prior therapeutic pleural aspirations. Whether preceding therapeutic aspirations may have contributed to an underestimation of RPO incidence in our cohort, however, remains uncertain. Finally, the interpretation of the multivariable analyses for radiological RPO is limited by the small number of events. Consequently, these results should be regarded as exploratory and hypothesis-generating rather than definitive. Although larger, prospective studies are needed to confirm these associations, the consistent links between younger age, larger pleural fluid volumes and clinical RPO highlight the importance of maintaining vigilance for RPO in these patients.

### A prospective randomized single-blind control study of volume threshold for chest tube removal following lobectomy [^09a52f25]. World Journal of Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Background

The aim of the current study was to assess the feasibility and safety of a new volume threshold for chest tube removal following lobectomy.

Methods

The prospective randomized single-blind control study included 90 consecutive patients who underwent lobectomy or bilobectomy for pathological conditions between March 2012 and September 2012. Eligible patients were randomized into two groups: early removal group (chest tube removal at the drainage volume of 300 ml/24 h or less) and traditional management group (chest tube removal when the drainage volume is less than 100 ml/24 h). Criteria for the early removal group were established and met prior to chest tube removal. The volume and characteristics of drainage, time of drainage tube extraction, and postoperative hospital stay were recorded. All patients received standard care while in the hospital and a follow-up visit was performed 7 days after discharge from hospital.

Results

In accordance with the exit criteria, 20 patients were excluded from the study. The remaining 70 patients included in the final analysis were divided into two groups: early removal group (n = 41) and traditional management group (n = 29). There was no difference between the two groups in terms of age, sex, comorbidities, and pathological evaluation of resection specimens. In eligible patients (n = 70), the mean volume of drainage 24 h after surgery was 300 ml, while the mean volume of drainage 48 h after surgery was 250 ml. The average daily drainage 48 h after surgery was significantly different than the average daily drainage 24 h after surgery (Z = -2.059, P = 0.039). The mean duration of chest tube placement was 44 h in the early removal group and 67 h in the traditional management group (P = 0.004). Patients who underwent early removal management had a shorter postoperative hospital stay compared to the traditional management group (5 vs. 6 days, P < 0.01). No statistically significant differences were observed between the rates of pleural effusion development, thoracentesis, and postoperative complications 1 week after hospital discharge.

Conclusion

Early removal of the chest tube after lobectomy is feasible and safe and may shorten patient hospital stay and reduce morbidity without the added risk of postoperative complications.

### Thoracic ultrasound for pleural effusion in the intensive care unit: a narrative review from diagnosis to treatment [^b6e3f1f2]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Several medical conditions are responsible for pleural effusion (PLEFF), with volume overload, congestive heart failure, and pleuropulmonary infection representing the most common causes in the intensive care unit (ICU). Fluid accumulation can take place due to an imbalance of hydrostatic and oncotic pressure across the lung capillaries, increased pleural membrane capillary permeability, and lymphatic obstruction. Furthermore, the factors known to promote lung edema formation in the clinical setting (fluid loading, myocardial depression, hypoalbuminemia) usually coexist, and may exceed the normally high absorptive capacity of the lungs and parietal pleural lymphatics, resulting in exacerbation of PLEFF.

PLEFF occurs frequently in ICU patients with an incidence that varies according to the diagnostic technique used (from 8% following physical examination to more than 60% after routine imaging). It is also associated with a high crude mortality rate. Indeed, PLEFF can worsen gas exchange, hemodynamic stability, and respiratory dynamics. Drainage can improve oxygenation, respiratory mechanics, and compliance by enhancing the ventilation:perfusion ratio and by re-expanding areas of collapsed parenchymal lung. Although percutaneous pleural drain insertion is frequently carried out in the ICU, inaccurate insertion of the tube can have tragic consequences. Complications with the insertion of chest drains have been reported in up to 20–30% of cases; some of these complications can be potentially fatal (i.e. perforation of the lung, heart, liver, esophagus, spleen, and inferior vena cava).

Prompt diagnosis of the presence and nature of PLEFF is vital in order to evaluate the best therapeutic choice (diuretics, invasive procedures). The use of thoracic ultrasound (TUS), a safe and non-invasive bedside procedure with good accuracy, can help clinicians to visualize the effusion and also to distinguish between different types (exudative, transudative empyema, hemothorax). Moreover, TUS is important during thoracentesis and the insertion of chest drains as it helps increase safety and decrease life-threatening complications (e.g. organ laceration and infection). It is fundamental not only during needle or drainage insertion, but also when monitoring the volume of PLEFF drained, and deciding when to remove the drainage tube. Furthermore, TUS can help diagnose co-existing lung diseases, often with higher specificity and sensitivity than chest radiography and without X-ray exposure. Consequently, TUS has become an essential skill for many specialists, especially intensivists.

### Early chest tube removal regardless of drainage volume after anatomic pulmonary resection: a multicenter, randomized, controlled trial [^bd358533]. The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Objectives

This study aimed to evaluate the safety and feasibility of early chest tube removal after anatomic pulmonary resection, regardless of the drainage volume.

Methods

We conducted a multicenter, randomized, controlled, noninferiority trial. Patients with greater than 300 mL drainage volume during postoperative day 1 were randomly assigned to group A (tube removed on postoperative day 2) and group B (tube retained until drainage volume ≤ 300 mL/24 hours). The primary end point was the frequency of respiratory-related adverse events (grade 2 or higher based on the Clavien-Dindo classification) within 30 days postoperatively.

Results

Between April 2019 and October 2021, 175 patients were assigned to group A (N = 88) or group B (N = 87). One patient in group B who experienced chylothorax was excluded from the study. Respiratory-related adverse events were observed in 10 patients (11.4%) in group A and 12 patients (14.0%) in group B (P = 0.008). The frequencies of thoracentesis or chest tube reinsertion were not significantly different (8.0% and 9.3% in groups A and B, respectively, P = 0.752). Additionally, the duration of chest tube placement was significantly shorter in group A than in group B (median, 2 vs 3 days; P < .001). No significant difference between groups A and B was found in postoperative hospital stay (median, 6 vs 7 days, P = 0.231).

Conclusions

Early chest tube removal, regardless of drainage volume, was safe and feasible in patients who underwent anatomic pulmonary resection.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in HIV — blood cultures and pleural effusion procedures: Blood cultures are more likely to be positive in individuals with HIV than in those without HIV, and given concerns for drug-resistant S. pneumoniae as well as S. aureus and/or other drug-resistant pathogens, blood cultures are recommended for patients with HIV who meet the criteria as noted above, and are optional for those who do not meet the criteria listed. Diagnostic thoracentesis should be performed in all patients with pleural effusion if concern exists for accompanying empyema, and pleural fluid should be sent for microbiologic studies. Therapeutic thoracentesis should be performed to relieve respiratory distress secondary to a moderate-to-large-sized pleural effusion, and clinicians should be vigilant for evidence of extra-pulmonary complications of infection.

### Improved heart hemodynamics after draining large-volume pleural effusion: a prospective cohort study [^f099e6cf]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Pleural effusion (PE) drainage can relieve the symptoms of dyspnea; however, details of the resulting hemodynamic changes remain undefined.

Methods

Subjects older than 12 years with massive PE requiring pleural drainage were included in this study. Hemodynamic parameters were collected using transthoracic echocardiography at pre-drainage, immediately post-drainage, and 24 h after drainage.

Results

We enrolled 47subjects in this prospective study from June 9, 2015 to September 18, 2016 in Beijing Chaoyang Hospital and 28 subjects were analyzed finally. Draining large-volume PE led to a progressive increase in left ventricular end-diastolic volume index, left atrial volume index, right ventricular area, right atrial area, left ventricular ejection fraction, stroke volume, and tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion, both immediately (P < 0.05) and 24 h after drainage (P < 0.05). The cardiac diastolic measurement ratios of early-transmitral flow velocity to diastolic mitral annular velocity and myocardial performance index decreased significantly following drainage (P < 0.05). More parameters were influenced by left-sided PE drainage. The correlation between effusion volume and changes in echocardiographic measurements was not statistically significant.

Conclusions

Improved preload, and systolic and diastolic function is pivotal for hemodynamic change after draining large PE volumes. Subjects experienced improved cardiac hemodynamics following PE drainage, underlining the beneficial therapeutic and subjective effects.

### Pneumothorax after reexpansion pulmonary edema: experience with 2 patients [^4564d794]. Journal of Bronchology & Interventional Pulmonology (2011). Low credibility.

Thoracentesis is one of the most commonly performed medical procedures with an excellent safety profile. We describe 2 patients, both of whom developed 2 very rare complications after image-guided thoracentesis. Both patients developed clinically relevant reexpansion pulmonary edema (RPE). Within 2 weeks of their first thoracentesis, both patients underwent a second thoracentesis, which was complicated by a large pneumothorax requiring drainage by tube thoracostomy. Pneumothorax and RPE are independent rare complications (< 1%) that occur after thoracentesis. The development of these unusual complications in the same sequence in these 2 patients suggests that there may be a causal relationship between pneumothorax and RPE after sequential thoracenteses. Further investigations are necessary to better describe the underlying pathophysiology and mechanism that may explain this association.

### The impact of thoracentesis on postprocedure pulse oximetry [^54d23148]. Journal of Bronchology & Interventional Pulmonology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Although thoracentesis can offer considerable symptomatic relief to the patient, its physiologic impact on oxygen saturation has not been well established in the literature. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of thoracentesis on postprocedure pulse oximetry (SpO2) in an inpatient population.

Methods

A retrospective study of patients undergoing thoracentesis from January 2012 to November 2017 was performed. Inclusion criteria were age above 18 and thoracentesis performed in an inpatient setting. Records were reviewed for patient demographics, procedure reports, and laboratory values. SpO2 and FiO2 values were collected before and 6 and 24 hours postprocedure. Multivariable linear regression models were used to evaluate for changes in SpO2 and SpO2/FiO2. Analyses were adjusted for age, sex, serum hemoglobin, effusion etiology, volume removed, nonexpandable lung physiology and procedural complications and FiO2.

Results

A total of 502 patients were included. The mean (SD) age was 60 (14) years, and 53.4% of the patients were male. The most common cause of pleural effusion was malignant effusion (37%). The median (interquartile range) volume of fluid removed was 1400 (1000 to 2000)mL and nonexpandable lung physiology was noted in 35%. There was no significant within-subject difference in 24 hours postprocedure SpO2 compared with preprocedure SpO2. In multivariable analysis, there was a small increase in 24-hour postprocedure SpO2 [β = 0.31, 95% confidence interval (0.22, 0.41), P < 0.01] and a similar small increase in 24-hour postprocedure SpO2/FiO2 [β = 0.84, 95% confidence interval: (0.68, 1.01), P < 0.01).

Conclusion

Among inpatients undergoing thoracentesis, there is no clinically significant change in SpO2 or SpO2/FiO2 at 24-hours post-procedure compared to pre-procedural SpO2 or SpO2/FiO2.

### Ultrasound guidance compared to anatomic landmark approach for thoracentesis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^702e8ecd]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Although thoracentesis has traditionally been performed with anatomic landmarking, ultrasound guidance is increasingly used. The primary objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to determine the difference in success rates between ultrasound guidance versus anatomic landmark technique. Secondary outcomes include assessing the effects of ultrasound guidance on complication rates.

Methods

MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, Scopus, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, LILACS, Web of Science Core Collection, Google Scholar, and the grey literature were searched for prospective randomized trials or cluster randomized trials comparing the success rate of ultrasound-guided to anatomic landmark thoracentesis in patients of all ages from inception to February 2024. Two investigators independently completed study screening, data extraction, and quality evaluations using the Cochrane Risk of Bias and GRADE tools. Outcomes were analyzed using random effects meta-analysis using generalized linear mixed effects models and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Results

Three papers met inclusion criteria (n = 417 patients). Overall, ultrasound-guided thoracentesis was successful in 195 of 202 patients (96.5%), and anatomic landmark thoracentesis was successful in 189 of 215 patients (87.9%). Ultrasound-guidance trended towards higher success rates (OR 3.99, 95% CI 0.60–26.50) and lower complication rates (OR 0.18, 95% CI 0.01–3.07). Only two of the three studies evaluated post-procedure pneumothorax: in sum, 1/99 of the ultrasound group versus 20/113 in the anatomic landmark group were complicated by pneumothorax.

Conclusions

This systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized trials found that ultrasound guidance for thoracentesis trended towards increased success and lower complication rates compared to anatomic landmark technique.

### AGA clinical practice update on the management of ascites, volume overload, and hyponatremia in cirrhosis: expert review [^001c8295]. Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Description

The purpose of this American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) Institute Clinical Practice Update (CPU) is to summarize the available evidence and offer expert Best Practice Advice (BPA) on the management of ascites, hepatic hydrothorax, volume overload, and hyponatremia in patients with cirrhosis.

Methods

This expert review was commissioned and approved by the AGA Institute Governing Board and Clinical Practice Updates Committee (CPUC) to provide timely guidance on a topic of high clinical importance to the AGA membership. This CPU expert review underwent internal peer review by the CPUC and external peer review through the standard procedures of Gastroenterology. These BPA statements were developed based on review of the published literature and expert opinion and approved by the AGA Institute Governing Board. Because formal systematic reviews were not performed, these BPA statements do not carry formal ratings of the quality of evidence or strength of the presented considerations. Best Practice Advice Statements BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 1: Patients with cirrhosis with ascites, hepatic hydrothorax, or volume overload should be managed with dietary sodium restriction and diuretics at the lowest effective dose, with dose escalation guided by symptoms, weight, urine output, and electrolyte/renal monitoring. Education and referral to a dietitian should be provided for dietary management. Triggers of liver decompensation should be identified and addressed. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 2: Patients with cirrhosis with new-onset ascites, or those admitted to the hospital for symptoms related to ascites or encephalopathy should receive diagnostic paracentesis as soon as possible. Testing should include serum ascites albumin gradient and cell count, Gram stain, and culture. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 3: Patients with hepatic hydrothorax with dyspnea and/or hypoxemia should undergo a therapeutic thoracentesis for both symptom relief and expansion of the underlying lung. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 4: All patients with refractory ascites and/or hepatic hydrothorax should be considered for liver transplantation evaluation, regardless of their Model for End-Stage Liver Disease score. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 5: Refractory ascites and/or hydrothorax should be managed with therapeutic paracentesis and/or thoracentesis, respectively, with the frequency guided by recurrence. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 6: When the volume of ascites removed is > 5 L, 20%-25% intravenous albumin 6–8 g per every total liter removed should be administered. For patients with hypotension, renal insufficiency, or electrolyte abnormalities, albumin should also be considered for removal of smaller volumes. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 7: Well-selected patients with refractory ascites, hepatic hydrothorax, volume overload, or hyponatremia should be referred for to transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 8: Diagnostic workup for the etiology of hyponatremia in cirrhosis should include dietary and medication history (diuretics, bowel regimen); review of electrolyte and kidney function; gastrointestinal bleeding assessment; infectious workup, including diagnostic paracentesis, and evaluation of secondary causes (thyroid or adrenal dysfunction). BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 9: Outpatient management of asymptomatic hypervolemic hyponatremia in liver cirrhosis entails both sodium and water restriction (aiming for 1–1.5 L of daily fluid intake), modification of diuretics and laxatives, and monitoring of electrolytes. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 10: Inpatient management of severe or symptomatic hypervolemic hyponatremia in liver cirrhosis includes both sodium and water restriction; modification or discontinuation of diuretics and laxatives; and additional measures, such as intravenous albumin based on volume assessment or oral vasoconstriction therapy. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 11: Recurrent or refractory hyponatremia management should involve a multidisciplinary approach (including the liver transplantation team when appropriate) and can consider several therapeutic options, including intravenous vasoconstrictor therapy, infusion of hypertonic saline, use of vasopressin receptor antagonist (vaptans), or use of renal replacement therapy. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 12: Inpatient management of volume overload includes escalation or trial of intravenous loop diuretics (furosemide or bumetanide) in bolus (2–3 times per day) or continuous fashion. Cautious escalation can be done every 2–3 days with monitoring of volume status, kidney function, daily weights, and symptoms. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 13: Advanced strategies in refractory anasarca should be coordinated with nephrology for consideration of diuretics in the setting of contraction alkalosis (eg, addition of acetazolamide), second agent with alternate mechanism of actions (eg, thiazide diuretics, such as metolazone), or need for ultrafiltration.

### Non-traumatic thoracic emergencies: imaging and treatment of thoracic fluid collections (including pneumothorax) [^7e79d5ea]. European Radiology (2002). Low credibility.

Cross-sectional imaging has revolutionised the radiological diagnosis of pleural collections. Not only can the precise location and volume of a pleural effusion be established, but also features specific for the aetiology of the effusion can be demonstrated. Increasingly, radiologists are called upon to perform image-guided biopsies, aspirations and small bore chest drain placement, all of which have been shown to be safe and efficacious. Pneumothoraces occurring due to acute trauma and in an intensive care setting can also benefit from radiological input, both in terms of diagnosis and image-guided treatment.

### Centers for disease control and prevention expert panel meetings on prevention and treatment of anthrax in adults [2014] [^91490002]. CDC (2014). Medium credibility.

Anthrax in adults — procedures and surgical interventions: Pleural fluid drainage has been positively associated with survival, and these data support the need for early and aggressive drainage of any clinically or radiographically apparent pleural effusions; chest tube drainage is recommended over thoracentesis because many effusions will require prolonged drainage. Thoracotomy or video-assisted thoracic surgery might be required to remove gelatinous or loculated collections, and ascites should also be drained and monitored for reaccumulation; continuous drainage might be required. Surgery might be contraindicated or indicated, depending on the type of anthrax; for cutaneous disease, surgery is contraindicated for acute disease, with the exception of tracheotomy for airway obstruction and surgical intervention for large or circumferential extremity lesions causing compartment syndrome. Surgery may be indicated for gastrointestinal anthrax to identify and address potentially fatal complications, such as bowel ischemia, necrosis, and perforation, and for injection anthrax, surgery is used to obtain diagnostic specimens and to remove the necrotic nidus of infection; surgery for injection anthrax should be more limited than that for necrotizing fasciitis, and resection should be performed only to healthy tissue. Compression of soft tissues can be released by incision, excision, or fasciotomy and might be required for treatment of compartment syndrome, and diathermy dissection is advised to optimize hemostasis.

### A simple chest drain gone wrong: a near miss! [^6cd69ca3]. BMJ Case Reports (2011). Medium credibility.

This is a case of a 45-year-old woman, with known alcoholic liver disease who presented with a large right-sided pleural effusion. A pleural tap was performed followed by insertion of an intercostal drain. 7 litres were drained over 4 h and only 300 mL of 20% albumin were administered with the patient becoming acutely short of breath and requiring admission to the intensive treatment unit due to the development of the known and recognised complication of re-expansion pulmonary oedema. The patient required continuous positive airway pressure in an intensive care setting but made a good recovery. It is important to consider re-expansion pulmonary oedema in patients who become acutely short of breath during drainage of pleural fluid or air. Steps should be made to ensure that drainage of large volumes of fluid are performed in a controlled manner to avoid this preventable complication.

What Does Optimal Communication Look Like?

Optimal communication involves a clear, written referral from the oncology team to the pleural services/pulmonology team. Referral should encourage two-way communication by including an invitation to contact the referrer if the receiving department has any queries. Proactive collaboration and communication between referring and recipient services is crucial for ensuring that guidelines are followed, and any deviations from the guidelines are appropriate. Subsequent interactions can be via phone, e-mail, or in-person and should focus on addressing treatment issues. The referring clinician must also ensure that the recipient team is adequately trained. Identification of knowledge gaps should prompt clinicians to organize training initiatives that should be led by health care professionals experienced in the treatment of MPE.

The pulmonologist placing the IPC should report the details of the procedure, including the amount of fluid drained, followed by specific recommendations on drainage frequency and volume at home.

Unanswered Questions

Treatments for MPE have seen little evolution for decades. Talc pleurodesis was first described in 1935 and IPCs were released onto the market in 1997. In the coming decade, we hope for progress on several key unanswered research questions, which could be transformative for the management of MPE and patient outcomes.

Unanswered questions:

1. Are there biomarkers that may help predict which treatment a patient will benefit the most from?
2. Are there drugs that may suppress pleural fluid production, thus avoiding interventions on the pleural space?
3. Are there any novel oncologic treatments that might be effective for managing MPE?
4. What are patients' and carers' key priorities concerning future MPE management?

In conclusion, the benefits and drawbacks of various treatment options may result in certain patients deriving greater advantages from one particular treatment than from another. It is possible that some patients are not offered optimal treatment, at times due to a reliance on specific local procedures, personal preferences of clinicians, lack of awareness, or misconceptions about specific treatment options. One size does not fit all; treatment choice needs to be made on the basis of the suitability, benefits, and risk profile for each particular patient. A detailed consideration of the patient's clinical characteristics at each step of the treatment pathway will help clinicians and patients to identify the optimal treatment. This can be supported by providing patients with balanced information regarding the benefits and risks of all treatment options. Following treatment choice, effective coordination of care between different teams will help maximize the benefits that each person can obtain from their chosen intervention.

### Re-expansion pulmonary oedema: two case reports and review of the current literature [^c20c993c]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

Re-expansion pulmonary oedema (RPE) is an uncommon complication that occurs when a collapsed lung suddenly re-expands, resulting in an osmotic shift of fluid from the blood vessels into the air spaces within the lungs. This condition can develop following thoracocentesis or intercostal chest drainage. We report two cases of RPE that developed after varying volumes of pleural drainage and at different times. Both patients responded well to non-invasive ventilation and hydrocortisone, making a full recovery. Early detection is crucial as RPE is associated with higher mortality rates, but a positive prognosis is attainable with prompt identification and intervention.

### Patterns of pleural pressure amplitude and respiratory rate changes during therapeutic thoracentesis [^52a41c29]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

We are aware about some limitations of our study. First, the investigated group was relatively small. The limited number of patients does not allow a full assessment of Ppl ampl and RR characteristics in subgroups presenting different patterns of changes. Very small groups of patients with inconsecutive increase in Ppl ampl (only 3 patients) and Ppl ampl decrease in the last phase of the procedure (5 patients) do not allow a reliable comparative analysis between of different variables in those groups. Second, as the vast majority of our patients had malignant pleural effusion we cannot be sure that the characteristics of Ppl ampl and RR changes would be similar in patients with non-malignant pleural effusion. Third, the analysis of Ppl ampl and RR changes in relation to the relative volume of withdrawn pleural effusion (% of the total volume removed in individual patients) may be questioned. However, this method of analysis was applied to make our results relatively independent of the absolute volume of removed pleural fluid. This approach was based on the assumption that in all patients therapeutic thoracentesis is a complete procedure independently of the volume of the withdrawn pleural fluid and justified the comparison of the procedures of removal of different volumes of pleural fluid. In our opinion, the analysis of Ppl ampl and RR as the function of absolute volume of removed pleural fluid in patients with removed pleural fluid volume ranging from 500 to 4250 mL would be even more controversial.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: non-small cell lung cancer, version 7.2025 [^dfae281d]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer pleural effusion and metastatic disease confirmation — Patients with lung cancer with an associated pleural effusion should undergo thoracentesis and cytology. A negative pleural cytology result does not exclude pleural involvement. Thoracoscopic evaluation of the pleura should be considered before starting curative intent therapy if pleural fluid is a lymphocytic exudate with negative pleural fluid cytology. Patients suspected of having a solitary site of metastatic disease should have tissue confirmation of that site if feasible. Patients suspected of having metastatic disease should have confirmation from one of the metastatic sites if feasible. Patients who may have multiple sites of metastatic disease — based on a strong clinical suspicion — should have biopsy of the primary lung lesion or mediastinal lymph nodes if it is technically difficult or very risky to biopsy a metastatic site. All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated.

Item 2. Pleural effusion (ESM 3, Video S5, S8–S10)

We recommend that the evaluation of the presence of an anechoic region above the diaphragm as primary sonographic finding of pleural effusion should be considered as basic skill (strong recommendation).
We recommend that the use of lung US to estimate the volume of pleural effusion should be considered as basic skill (strong recommendation).
We recommend that the presence of additional internal echoes within the effusion to suggest the presence of complicated effusions (e.g. exudates, empyema, hemorrhage) should be considered as basic skill (strong recommendation).
We recommend that the use of lung US to determine the indication and position for drainage of a pleural effusion should be considered as basic skill (strong recommendation).
We recommend that the use of lung US to monitor the effectiveness and complications of the drainage and procedure should be considered as basic skill (strong recommendation).

Background

The use of US for the assessment of pleural effusions, visualized as an anechoic space between the pleurae, has been acknowledged for many years. Lung US is more sensitive than CXR in identifying small pleural effusions and more specific in distinguishing pleural effusion from consolidations/collapse; it also allows a reliable quantification of the effusion volume when compared to the actual volume of fluid collected with thoracentesis, with accuracy comparable to CT. The panel was strongly in favor of the use of ultrasound to identify pleural effusion, to guide pleural drainage and monitor effectiveness/complications of the procedure.
