## Question

Staphylococcus food poison symptoms

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the symptoms of Staphylococcus aureus food poisoning. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiology because symptoms are toxin-driven rather than infection-driven. Then, I should verify the classic incubation period and why it is so short. Next, I will enumerate the cardinal symptoms and their relative frequencies. After that, I need to check for atypical features and how often fever occurs. Then, I will review the typical duration and severity, including who might need hospitalization. Finally, I will consider how to distinguish this from look-alike causes and summarize the key differentiators that anchor bedside diagnosis.

> Let me first confirm the mechanism, because that dictates the symptom profile. Staphylococcus aureus food poisoning is an intoxication from preformed enterotoxins, most commonly enterotoxin A, that are heat-stable and not destroyed by cooking; illness results from ingesting the toxin rather than bacterial invasion, which explains the rapid onset and prominent vomiting, so I need to keep that front and center as I interpret symptoms [^8e160828] [^6816f4c5] [^8badd17a].

> I should confirm the incubation period next. The onset is typically 30 minutes to 8 hours after exposure, with a mean around 2–4 hours, which is much faster than infection-based foodborne illnesses; this short window is a hallmark that helps distinguish toxin-mediated disease from invasive pathogens, so I need to ask about timing relative to the suspect meal very carefully [^a1a657fd] [^8badd17a].

> Now, let me enumerate the cardinal symptoms and verify their frequencies. The predominant features are abrupt, sometimes violent nausea and vomiting, abdominal cramping, and diarrhea that may be watery; prostration and weakness are common, and headache can occur, while fever is usually absent or low-grade, which is a key discriminator from many infectious etiologies [^a1a657fd] [^f8e164b5] [^51ac21a8].

> Wait, let me verify the fever point because it is easy to overcall. In outbreak series, most patients do not have significant fever, and when chills are reported, they are often without documented pyrexia; this pattern supports the toxin mechanism rather than a systemic infection, so I should be cautious about attributing high fever to staphylococcal food poisoning unless another process is present [^f8e164b5] [^51ac21a8].

> I will now examine duration and severity. Illness is typically self-limited and resolves within 24–48 hours, but symptoms can be intense enough to cause dehydration and require supportive care or hospitalization, particularly in vulnerable hosts such as the very young, older adults, or immunocompromised individuals; this is consistent with public health guidance and outbreak descriptions [^a1a657fd] [^8badd17a] [^51ac21a8].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about mimics. I need to ensure I differentiate this from other short-incubation emetic syndromes, especially Bacillus cereus emetic syndrome, which also presents within 1–6 hours with vomiting and can include diarrhea; Clostridium perfringens tends to have a longer incubation and less prominent vomiting, and norovirus often has a longer incubation with more prominent vomiting across a broader window, so anchoring on the 30-minute to 8-hour onset with vomiting predominance and minimal fever strengthens the diagnosis of staphylococcal intoxication [^3c005856] [^8c521c48] [^425a80e2].

> Let me reconsider any atypical features I might be missing. Although fever is uncommon, low-grade fever or mild hypothermia can occur, and some patients report chills without documented temperature elevation; these variations do not negate the diagnosis if the core pattern of rapid-onset vomiting with abdominal cramps and short duration is present, so I should integrate the whole clinical picture rather than a single atypical sign [^f8e164b5] [^51ac21a8].

> To synthesize, I should double-check that the classic triad is present: rapid onset within 30 minutes to 8 hours, prominent nausea and vomiting with abdominal cramping, and minimal or absent fever, with resolution in 24–48 hours; when this pattern is accompanied by a history of foods handled without subsequent cooking or held in the temperature danger zone, the pretest probability for staphylococcal food poisoning is high, and supportive care remains the cornerstone while antibiotics are not indicated for the intoxication itself [^a1a657fd] [^8badd17a] [^677070fa].

---

Staphylococcus food poisoning presents with **rapid-onset nausea, vomiting, and abdominal cramps** [^8badd17a], typically within 30 minutes to 8 hours after eating contaminated food [^a1a657fd]. Diarrhea may occur but is less prominent, and fever is usually absent or low-grade [^51ac21a8]. Symptoms are intense but **self-limited**, resolving within 24–48 hours [^a1a657fd]; supportive care with hydration is the mainstay, and antibiotics are not indicated [^677070fa].

---

## Incubation period

The incubation period is **30 minutes to 8 hours** [^8badd17a], with a mean of 2–4 hours [^3c005856]. This short interval reflects ingestion of preformed enterotoxins rather than bacterial growth in the gut [^6816f4c5].

---

## Common symptoms

- **Nausea and vomiting**: Predominant features; vomiting is often profuse and projectile [^a1a657fd].
- **Abdominal cramps**: Severe, cramping pain is typical [^a1a657fd].
- **Diarrhea**: May occur but is usually milder and less frequent than vomiting [^a1a657fd].
- **Prostration and weakness**: Patients often feel exhausted and debilitated [^51ac21a8].
- **Headache**: Commonly reported [^f8e164b5].
- **Low-grade fever or mild hypothermia**: May occur but is uncommon [^f8e164b5].

---

## Less common symptoms

- **Chills without fever**: Occasionally reported [^f8e164b5].
- **Dizziness or lightheadedness**: Due to dehydration from vomiting [^notfound].
- **Muscle aches**: Rarely reported [^notfound].

---

## Duration and severity

Illness is typically **self-limited**, resolving within 24–48 hours [^a1a657fd]. Severity varies with toxin dose and individual susceptibility; symptoms are often intense but rarely life-threatening in healthy individuals [^51ac21a8]. Hospitalization is uncommon and usually reserved for severe dehydration or high-risk patients (elderly, immunocompromised, very young) [^8badd17a].

---

## Differential diagnosis

- **Bacillus cereus emetic syndrome**: Similar rapid-onset vomiting but often linked to rice dishes [^3c005856].
- **Norovirus**: Longer incubation (12–48 hours), more prominent diarrhea, and fever are less common [^425a80e2].
- **Clostridium perfringens**: Longer incubation (6–24 hours), prominent abdominal cramps and diarrhea, minimal vomiting [^8c521c48].
- **Chemical food poisoning**: Even shorter onset (< 1 hour) with distinct features (e.g. metallic taste, cyanosis) [^3c005856].

---

## Management

- **Supportive care**: Rehydration (oral or IV) is the cornerstone; antiemetics may be used for severe vomiting [^422b42ed].
- **Antibiotics**: Not indicated, as illness is toxin-mediated and not bacterial [^677070fa].
- **Monitoring**: Watch for dehydration and complications in high-risk patients [^8badd17a].

---

Staphylococcus food poisoning is characterized by **rapid-onset vomiting and cramps** with minimal fever and a short, self-limited course; supportive care suffices and antibiotics are not needed [^8badd17a].

What are the implications for public health practice?

This report highlights the importance of immediate public health outbreak response, adds to the understanding of food poisoning caused by S. aureus, and confirms the need to communicate better food safety practices to both food workers and the general public. Laboratory use of toxin detection kits can provide rapid identification of staphylococcal enterotoxins directly from food and help guide the response of public health authorities.

S. aureus produces numerous serologically distinct enterotoxins, (A through V, excluding F). Staphylococcal enterotoxin A is considered the main cause of staphylococcal food poisoning. Illness can be caused by ingestion of as little as 20 ng of enterotoxin. Although staphylococci commonly are found on environmental surfaces and in various food products, food handlers carrying enterotoxin-producing S. aureus in their noses or on their hands are regarded as the main source of contamination.

Temperature limits for S. aureus replication and enterotoxin production are 43°F–118°F (6°C–48°C) and 50°F–115°F (10°C–46°C), respectively. Optimal growth temperatures for S. aureus replication and enterotoxin production are 95°F–106°F (35°C–41°C) and 93°F–104°F (34°C–40°C), respectively. Staphylococcal enterotoxins are resistant to heat treatment, low pH, and proteolytic enzymes (all of which easily destroy S. aureus). Once toxins are produced, they are retained through subsequent food preparation and storage processes and digestive tract ingestion. Measures to prevent the proliferation of the S. aureus organism therefore are critical.

In this outbreak, the initial source of contamination of the perlo is unknown but might have occurred while the preparer was handling the chicken after it was initially cooked. The overnight storage of the precooked perlo in an unrefrigerated environment was the probable cause of organism proliferation and enterotoxin production. Subsequent rewarming of the perlo for approximately 1 hour the following day did not destroy the heat-stable toxin and might have further increased toxin load.

### An outbreak of community-acquired foodborne illness caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus [^677070fa]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Despite its ubiquity as a health-care-acquired pathogen and increasing reports of community-acquired infections, MRSA has not previously been reported as a cause of outbreaks of gastroenteritis. Staphylococcal food poisoning is estimated to account for 185,000 foodborne illnesses per year in the United States; most of these go unreported. Because staphylococcal food poisoning is toxin mediated and generally self-limited, antibiotics are not used for therapy. Also, many S. aureus isolates obtained as part of outbreak investigations may not be tested for antibiotic susceptibility, and therefore methicillin-resistant strains may go unrecognized as the cause of foodborne outbreaks of acute gastroenteritis. Methicillin-resistant strains of S. aureus are as likely to produce enterotoxins as are methicillin-sensitive strains. Therefore, outbreaks of acute gastroenteritis due to MRSA are not unexpected.

Until recently, MRSA has been considered primarily a health- care-associated pathogen, causing invasive disease in which multidrug resistance poses a substantial challenge to successful treatment. Food has been implicated as a source of spread in one outbreak of blood and wound infections in hospitalized immunocompromised patients. There has been some debate about the appropriateness of the term "community-acquired" to describe many S. aureus infections in which distant hospital exposures cannot be excluded with certainty and colonization can persist for years. In this outbreak, it appears that MRSA-contaminated food was the vehicle in a cluster of illnesses affecting low-risk persons within the community and that this food was likely contaminated by an asymptomatic carrier whose only apparent exposures were intermittent visits to a nursing home. This outbreak could be an example of second-generation spread of a health-care-associated pathogen into the community. The outbreak strain of MRSA, however, was resistant only to penicillin and oxacillin and was sensitive to all other antibiotics tested. A strain originating in a health-care facility would have an increased likelihood of being multidrug resistant.

Green beans with potatoes

On the morning of July 30, the green bean and potato dish was prepared by combining canned green beans and chopped potatoes in a slow cooker on a high setting.

All precooked food was maintained in slow cookers for transport on July 30 and reheated at the venue in separate slow cookers with the exception of the chicken wings, which were placed in a foil container after preparation and never reheated. The food was served buffet style at approximately 11:00 a.m. using utensils owned by the preparer. Throughout the food preparation and food service process, food preparers did not wear gloves. The preparers did not have any open wounds on their hands, and their hands were not tested for any organisms.

Editorial Note

Staphylococcal food poisoning, one of the most common foodborne illnesses in the United States, is caused by ingestion of one or more preformed staphylococcal enterotoxins. S. aureus is able to grow and express enterotoxins in a wide variety of foods (e.g. milk, meat, and egg products; mixed foods; cakes; and ice cream). Intoxication is characterized by rapid onset of nausea, violent and copious vomiting, and abdominal cramping (with or without diarrhea). Fever usually is absent. The incubation period ranges from 30 minutes to 8 hours (3 hours on average), depending on individual susceptibility and the amount of toxin ingested. Illness usually is self-limited, resolving in 24–48 hours, and rarely is severe enough to warrant hospitalization.

What is already known on this topic?

Staphylococcus aureus intoxication is a common foodborne illness that usually is not detected or reported because outbreaks are sudden and short-lived, have a low mortality rate, and laboratory confirmation is not obtained. Staphylococcal enterotoxin A is the most common cause of staphylococcal food poisoning.

What is added by this report?

This report describes 22 cases of staphylococcal intoxication associated with a lunch party at a military base. Epidemiologic analysis suggested a preformed enterotoxin in a chicken, sausage, and rice dish. Isolation of S. aureus along with identification of staphylococcal enterotoxin A in food confirmed the cause of illness. Rapid detection methods, which are widely available commercially, were used to detect the enterotoxin in food samples, establishing the likely cause of the outbreak before culture results were available.

### Guidelines for foodborne disease outbreak response. 2nd ed [^6816f4c5]. CDC (2014). Medium credibility.

Etiologic agents associated with foodborne diseases — preformed toxins versus infections explains that preformed toxins most often result from bacteria, such as Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, and Clostridium botulinum, that release toxins into food during growth in the food; the preformed toxin is ingested and live bacteria do not need to be consumed, illness manifests more rapidly, and the incubation period is often minutes or hours, with signs and symptoms that commonly include vomiting and other symptoms ranging from nausea and diarrhea to interference with sensory and motor functions (e.g., double vision, weakness, respiratory failure, numbness, tingling of the face, disorientation), and fever is rarely present. In contrast, infections result from growth of a microorganism in the body via two mechanisms — organisms invade tissues and directly damage them, or organisms invade and multiply and then release toxins (enterotoxins) — so the incubation periods for infections are relatively long, often days, compared with minutes or hours as with preformed toxins; symptoms of infection usually include diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal cramps, fever and an elevated white blood cell count can also occur, and if spread to the bloodstream occurs, organs such as the liver, spleen, gallbladder, bones, and meninges can be affected with longer duration and increased severity.

### Laboratory exposures to staphylococcal enterotoxin B [^b1438d37]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Staphylococcal enterotoxins are 23- to 29-kDa polypeptides in the bacterial superantigen protein family that act by cross-linking HLA-DR or DQ molecules and T-cell receptors. This cross-linking results in potentially pathologic levels of proinflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor α, interleukin 2, and interferon-γ. Therefore, symptoms of mild exposure are anticipated to resemble T-cell–mediated recall responses, similar to a Mantoux skin test.

Staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB) is one of at least 15 antigenically distinct enterotoxin proteins. Clinical symptoms depend on the route of exposure. After inhalation of SEB, clinical features include fever, respiratory complaints (cough, dyspnea, and retrosternal discomfort or chest pain), and gastrointestinal symptoms; severe intoxication results in pulmonary edema, adult respiratory distress syndrome, shock, and death. Ingesting SEB may cause food poisoning within 1 to 6 hours of exposure, manifested as acute salivation, nausea, and vomiting, followed by abdominal cramps and diarrhea. As ingesting SEB does not typically result in pulmonary symptoms, gastrointestinal symptoms observed from inhalational intoxication are postulated to result from secondary oral ingestion of SEB concomitant with the inhalational exposure.

One laboratory incident that resulted in nine cases of inhalational intoxication to SEB and several other outbreaks of food poisoning from ingesting staphylococcal enterotoxins have been reported in the literature. Symptoms occurring after ocular exposure and localized cutaneous swelling or conjunctivitis from staphylococcal enterotoxins have not been reported. We report three cases of purulent conjunctivitis with localized facial swelling that occurred after ocular exposure to SEB in the laboratory. Two of the three patients also complained of gastrointestinal symptoms. The symptoms in these three mucocutaneous-acquired cases, and summary of symptoms from 16 laboratory-acquired inhalational intoxications with SEB, may help define the clinical spectrum that might be expected after SEB exposures. The full spectrum of clinical signs and symptoms of intoxication with SEB is important to healthcare workers evaluating persons with potential exposures to these agents, including in the context of bioterrorism. This discussion is also relevant to military practitioners, since SEB has been previously developed as an incapacitating biowarfare agent.

### Outbreak of staphylococcal food poisoning from a military unit lunch party-United States, July 2012 [^0c23d9c0]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2013). Low credibility.

Toxin detection kits are commercially available and can detect staphylococcal enterotoxins A through E directly from food. The commercial testing platforms usually are passive agglutination or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. The B. cereus and S. aureus enterotoxin tests used in this outbreak are only approved for food samples; the test for the C. perfringens enterotoxin is approved only for stool specimens. The commercial kits were helpful in the identification of S. aureus toxin as the cause of this outbreak and might be useful for state and local public health agencies.

In this outbreak, as in many others, poor food handling practices and inadequate refrigeration of foods were identified as the main contributing factors. Staphylococcal contamination and subsequent intoxication can be prevented by ensuring clean food preparation, storage, and equipment surfaces, and by immediately cooling and storing prepared "potentially hazardous" foods at temperatures below 41°F (5°C). To permit rapid cooling after preparation, food should be stored in small portions in containers that are shallow and loosely covered to facilitate adequate air flow and rapid transfer of heat from the food to the container. Consuming food immediately after preparation or removal from refrigeration also is advisable. Finally, handwashing for 20 seconds using soap and water before handling food and food preparation and storage materials is a simple but effective preventive measure to avoid staphylococcal contamination.

### Fast, simultaneous, and sensitive detection of staphylococci [^568e4ae5]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2003). Low credibility.

Aims

Bacterial infections are common and are involved in many forms of disease, ranging from arthritis to food poisoning. Of much concern are nosocomial infections, especially the increasing resistance of bacteria to methicillin. A prerequisite for the successful treatment of bacterial infections is a specific and sensitive method of detecting microorganisms.

Methods

Some methods to detect bacteria are time consuming, whereas others are faster but lack specificity and/or sensitivity. This article describes an optimised polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method that enables the simultaneous detection of different bacteria. A prerequisite for sensitive PCR is a method to isolate and recover extremely small amounts of bacterial DNA. This study used a new method to isolate DNA and compared the results to an established method.

Results

The method could detect fewer than 10 Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin resistant S aureus, Staphylococcus epidermitis, and other bacteria and it took less than two hours to perform.

Conclusion

The rapid DNA isolation method used in conjunction with the optimised PCR makes it possible to confirm the presence or absence of extremely small numbers of bacteria. Using real time PCR would shorten the procedure even further. This method might therefore contribute to more timely and specific interventions.

### Food poisoning symptoms | Food safety… [^98e70266]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Symptoms of food poisoning depend on the type of germ you swallowed.
- The most common symptoms include diarrhea, stomach pain or cramps, nausea, vomiting, and fever.
- Severe food poisoning can cause bloody diarrhea, diarrhea that lasts more than 3 days, fever over 102°F, frequent vomiting, and dehydration. The most common symptoms of food poisoning are:

- Diarrhea
- Stomach pain or cramps
- Nausea
- Vomiting
- Fever If you have diarrhea or vomiting, be sure to drink plenty of fluids to prevent dehydration. Germ Symptoms and when they start Common sources Staphylococcus aureus Nausea, vomiting, stomach cramps, diarrhea 30 minutes to 8 hours Foods that are not cooked after handling, such as sliced meats, puddings, pastries, and sandwiches.

Watery diarrhea, nausea, stomach cramps, vomiting, fever, chills Within 24 hours Raw or undercooked shellfish, particularly oysters Diarrhea, stomach cramps that last for less than 24 hours Vomiting and fever are not common 6 to 24 hours Meat, poultry, gravies, and other foods cooked in large batches and held at an unsafe temperature.

### Laboratory exposures to staphylococcal enterotoxin B [^a120733b]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

High levels of cytokines alone may cause symptoms similar to SEB intoxication. Cancer patients, given high doses intravenously of the cytokine interleukin-2, have symptoms of fever, malaise, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, similar to SE food poisoning. Also, intravenous OKT3, a monoclonal antibody used as an immunosuppressant in transplant patients (it binds to T lymphocytes, resulting in early activation of T cells, cytokine release, and subsequent blocking of T-cell functions), has a side effect profile similar to that of SEB — high fever, gastrointestinal symptoms, arthralgias, and pulmonary symptoms.

The mechanism of emesis also has been postulated to be related to the stimulation of mast cells and the subsequent release of cysteinyl leukotrienes and histamine. L4 171883, a selective inhibitor of LTD4/LTEF receptors, completely eliminated the emetic response and immediate type skin reactions (skin reactions associated with degranulation of cutaneous mast cells) to SEB. Inhibition of prostaglandins by indomethicin or pretreatment with a dual lipoxygenase and cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor (BW 755C) did not prevent emesis or immediate type skin reactions. After degranulation of mast cells, impulses are sent through the vagus and sympathetic nerves to the medullary center, which results in emesis. Severing of the vagus and sympathetic nerves inhibits the emesis response.

The mechanism of diarrhea is even less well understood, although it is not by means of activation of adenylate cyclase. Histopathologic findings with staphylococcal food poisoning are minimal; they mainly show polymorphonuclear cell infiltrates in the epithelium and lamina propria of the stomach and proximal small intestine.

SEB intoxication is diagnosed by clinical symptoms and a history of potential exposure to SEB. Definitive diagnosis of inhalational exposure can be made by nasal swabs and induced respiratory secretions for toxin assays, blood and urine for immunoassay, and acute- and convalescent-phase serum, but these tests are not readily available and not reliable for low-dose exposures. While inhalational intoxication with SEB is generally associated with leukocytosis and a mildly elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, these findings are nonspecific. Chest x-ray findings of increased interstitial markings, atelectesis, overt pulmonary edema, or acute respiratory distress syndrome are also nonspecific and only present in inhalational intoxications of SEB. Potential changes in serum antibody titers, although relevant, have not been examined.

### Emetic potentials of newly identified staphylococcal enterotoxin-like toxins [^32abc31d]. Infection and Immunity (2013). Low credibility.

Staphylococcal enterotoxins (SEs) are a common causative agent of food poisoning. Recently, many new SE-like (SEl) toxins have been reported, although the role of SEls in food poisoning remains unclear. In this study, the emetic potentials of SElK, SElL, SElM, SElN, SElO, SElP, and SElQ were assessed using a monkey-feeding assay. All the SEls that were tested induced emetic reactions in monkeys at a dose of 100 μg/kg, although the numbers of affected monkeys were significantly smaller than the numbers that were affected after consuming SEA or SEB. This result suggests that these new SEs may play some role in staphylococcal food poisoning.

### Thecomplex: implications for the clinical microbiology laboratory [^937c229d]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2025). Medium credibility.

MEMBERS OF THE S. AUREUS COMPLEX

S. aureus sensu stricto

S. aureus is a bacterial pathogen responsible for over 1 million deaths annually and is the leading cause of fatal bloodstream infections and skin and soft tissue infections worldwide. S. aureus also causes osteomyelitis, endocarditis, pneumonia, toxic shock syndrome, and food poisoning and produces a wide variety of virulence factors and toxins that contribute to its high human mortality and morbidity. Methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), which confers resistance to commonly used beta-lactam antibiotics, is also among the world's deadliest drug-resistant pathogens and continues to be a WHO high-priority bacterial pathogen as of 2024.

S. aureus sensu stricto includes two accepted subspecies: S. aureus subsp. aureus and S. aureus subsp. anaerobius. Nearly all human S. aureus infections are attributed to S. aureus subsp. aureus, which is also associated with colonization and disease in a wide range of animal hosts including companion animals, ruminants, poultry, and aquatic mammals. In contrast, S. aureus subsp. anaerobius is a zoonotic pathogen of goats and sheep and is rarely isolated in human specimens.

### Outbreak of staphylococcal food poisoning from a military unit lunch party-United States, July 2012 [^82d5d848]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2013). Low credibility.

On July 30, 2012, the emergency department at a military hospital was visited by 13 persons seeking care for gastrointestinal illness with onset 2–3 hours after a work lunch party. The hospital responded by opening up temporary evaluation and treatment capacity in primary-care clinics and a progressive-care unit and by diverting one patient to a local civilian hospital. An immediate outbreak investigation was conducted by local military public health personnel with assistance from CDC. Initial epidemiologic analysis implicated "perlo" (a chicken, sausage, and rice dish) and bacterial intoxication as the outbreak mechanism. This enabled public health personnel to 1) recommend no further consumption of perlo and 2) reassure appropriate authorities that no additional ill persons likely would be seeking care and advise that nothing more than supportive care of ill persons likely would be required. After interviewing party attendees, investigators found nine additional persons who met their case definition. Subsequent CDC laboratory analysis of a sample of perlo detected staphylococcal enterotoxin A, supporting the epidemiologic findings. Improper food handling and preparation measures were identified and addressed by the appropriate authorities, who provided additional detailed education on food preparation safety for the persons who prepared the meal.

### Pseudomembranous colitis secondary to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) [^80ce4aed]. BMJ Case Reports (2016). Medium credibility.

A 37-year-old woman with a history of type II diabetes and Crohn's disease, status postcholecystectomy, presented with a > 2-week history of cramping abdominal pain, nausea, non-bloody/non-bilious emesis and, later, diarrhoea. A flexible sigmoidoscopy was performed, revealing that 'a segmental pseudomembrane was found from rectum to sigmoid colon'. Clostridium difficile PCR on the stool was repeated twice and resulted negative both times. A food history prior to onset of symptoms was consistent with Staphylococcal food poisoning and a stool culture was positive for heavy growth of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and the absence of enteric flora. The patient was successfully treated with oral vancomycin.

### Guidelines for foodborne disease outbreak response. 2nd ed [^70a48ceb]. CDC (2014). Medium credibility.

Etiologic agents associated with foodborne diseases — distribution and detection patterns are summarized: During 2009–2010, parasites accounted for < 1% of outbreaks with identified etiologies, marine algae and fish toxins, mushroom toxins, and chemicals accounted for 4% of outbreaks with an identified cause, and the most commonly reported chemical/toxin causes were scombrotoxin (42%) and ciguatoxin (35%). For a large proportion (31%) of outbreaks reported during 2009–2010, no etiologic agent was identified, with reasons including inadequate collection of stool specimens, delay in outbreak detection and specimen collection, and inappropriate testing of specimens, and many outbreaks of foodborne illness from viruses probably fall into the "unknown etiologic agent" category because laboratory methods for confirming viral diseases are less available than tests for bacterial diseases. The text also notes that not all outbreaks are detected, investigated, and reported to CDC, that outbreaks most likely to reach public health authorities are those that can cause serious illness, hospitalization, or death, and that diseases with short incubation periods (such as those caused by chemical agents or staphylococcal enterotoxin) might be more readily recognized than those with longer incubation periods (such as hepatitis A).

Epidemiologic and Environmental Investigation

Immediate steps were taken to interview the 12 patients who received care at the military hospital (one of the 13 who sought care at the emergency department was diverted to a local civilian hospital) using a questionnaire to define the problem, make public health and clinical recommendations as necessary, and assess future patient, hospital, and military installation impact. A case initially was defined as gastrointestinal illness (i.e. nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, or diarrhea) in a person who had attended the lunch party. Stool specimens were obtained from three persons who met this case definition, and leftover food was collected from all prepared dishes and sent to CDC for analysis. A party attendee list was obtained, and 35 (88%) of 40 attendees were interviewed with the same questionnaire; the other five attendees were not available for interview. The case definition was later modified to include any of the 35 attendees who experienced gastrointestinal illness within 24 hours of the party.

Of the 35 persons interviewed, 22 (62%) met the modified case definition. Among the 22 patients, 19 (86%) had nausea, 15 (69%) vomiting, 17 (77%) diarrhea, 17 (77%) abdominal pain, and 13 (59%) headache. Thirteen (59%) reported feeling chills without fever, four (18%) reported fever with chills. None of the 12 persons who received care at the military hospital had a documented temperature > 100.5°F (> 38.1°C). Other than the 13 persons who sought care at the military hospital (one was diverted to a civilian hospital), no other person who was interviewed and met the case definition sought medical care. Mean self-reported period to illness onset was 2.1 hours from the time of consumption (Figure), and mean duration of illness was 10.7 hours (range: 1–32 hours).

### Food poisoning [^fad5396a]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2007). Low credibility.

Food poisoning is encountered throughout the world. Many of the toxins responsible for specific food poisoning syndromes are no longer limited to isolated geographic locations. With increased travel and the ease of transporting food products, it is likely that a patient may present to any emergency department with the clinical effects of food poisoning. Recognizing specific food poisoning syndromes allows emergency health care providers not only to initiate appropriate treatment rapidly but also to notify health departments early and thereby prevent further poisoning cases. This article reviews several potential food-borne poisons and describes each agent's mechanism of toxicity, expected clinical presentation, and currently accepted treatment.

### An outbreak of community-acquired foodborne illness caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus [^b557f927]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

Infection with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) has been reported in the United States for over 30 years. Initially, MRSA infections were primarily a problem of hospitals and nursing homes; by 1997, 50% of health-care-acquired S. aureus isolates in the United States were methicillin resistant. Beginning in the early 1980s, cases of community-acquired MRSA were reported, primarily in persons with a history of injection drug use and other high-risk patients. More recently, community-acquired MRSA has been described in both adults and children who did not have extensive exposure to hospitals or other apparent risk factors. We describe the first report of a community-acquired outbreak of acute gastroenteritis caused by MRSA.

### The complete genome sequence of theBacteriophage metroid [^76cf0a46]. G3 (2020). Medium credibility.

Pathogens of the genus Staphylococcus, known for their ability to evade the human immune system, are an important public health concern causing a multitude of community-acquired infections ranging from food poisoning to skin lesions and life-threatening sepsis. As Staphylococcus largely reproduces clonally, much of the genetic diversity among strains stems from horizontal gene transfer through bacteriophages. Thereby, the acquisition of novel genes may not only aid adaptation of a bacterial strain to novel environments, but it can also increase pathogenicity. Bacteriophages play an important role in bacterial pathogenesis as they encode for many known staphylococcal virulence factors (see review by). Moreover, bacteriophages can mediate the mobilization and transfer of genomic pathogenicity islands. On the other hand, virulent bacteriophages, which lyse their host cell after successful reproduction, also represent promising new avenues for the treatment of antibiotic-resistant Staphylococcus infections through phage therapy.

Food testing limitations and interpretation — Note: Food testing has inherent limitations because most testing is agent-specific, and demonstration of an agent in food, especially viruses, is not always possible or necessary before implementation of public health action. Detection of microbes or toxins in food is most important for outbreaks involving preformed toxins such as enterotoxins of Staphylococcus aureus or Bacillus cereus, where detection of toxin or toxin-producing organisms in human specimens frequently is problematic. In addition, organisms such as S. aureus and Clostridium perfringens, which are commonly found in the human intestinal tract, can confound interpretation of culture results. Furthermore, results of testing are often difficult to interpret. Because contaminants in food change with time, samples collected during an investigation might not represent food ingested when the outbreak occurred. Subsequent handling or processing of food might result in the death of microorganisms, multiplication of microorganisms originally present in low levels, or introduction of new contaminants.

### Multi-target mode of action of silver against Staphylococcus aureus endows it with capability to combat antibiotic resistance [^a3e84318]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Both hospital-acquired and community-acquired staphylococcal infections are increasing steadily with Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) being one of the five most common causes of hospital-acquired infections. S. aureus is the causative agent of a variety of diseases, such as skin infection, food poisoning, bone/joint infection, and bacteremia, ranging from sub-acute superficial skin infection to life-threatening septicemia. The rise in incidence has been accompanied by an increase in antibiotic-resistant strains, notably methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), and vancomycin-resistant strains. Moreover, the outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic may further increase antimicrobial resistance due to the heavy use of antibiotics to treat patients infected with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2). Given the rapid emergence of drug-resistant S. aureus but a lack of antibiotic-development pipeline, alternative strategies are urgently needed to combat antibiotic-resistant S. aureus.

### Outbreak of staphylococcal food poisoning from a military unit lunch party-United States, July 2012 [^170a924e]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2013). Low credibility.

Illness was associated with eating perlo (risk ratio = 5.7); however, the association did not reach statistical significance (95% confidence interval = 0.9–35.0) (Table). The stool specimens from three patients and samples from the four main dishes (i.e. perlo, chicken wings, pulled pork, and green beans with potatoes) were sent to CDC for laboratory testing for the most likely bacterial organisms based on the epidemiologic investigation (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, and Clostridium perfringens). Using commercially available rapid detection test kits, laboratory workers tested all of the four main dishes for the presence of staphylococcal enterotoxins (A through E) and B. cereus diarrheal toxins (HBL and NHE). The three stool specimens were tested for C. perfringens enterotoxin (CPE).

Laboratory testing detected staphylococcal enterotoxin A in the perlo dish, confirming that this outbreak resulted from a staphylococcal intoxication. Evidence of enterotoxin was not found in the other foods. Perlo was cultured for S. aureus, and 7.2 × 10⁶ colony forming units/g were isolated. Nucleic acid amplification testing of coagulase-positive isolates detected the enterotoxin gene sea, but not seb, sec, sed, see, or seh. Testing for B. cereus and C. perfringens was negative.

Signs, symptoms, incubation period, and duration of illness — categorization of suspected foodborne illness can aid agent identification. In identifying the likely etiologic agent on the basis of signs, symptoms, incubation period, and duration of illness, it is often helpful to first categorize a suspected foodborne illness as resulting from a preformed toxin, enterotoxin, or infection, and illnesses from preformed toxins are caused by ingestion of food already contaminated by toxins.

### Increasing hospitalizations and general practice prescriptions for community-onset staphylococcal disease, england [^85fd8549]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

Harmless colonization of the nasal membranes and skin with Staphylococcus aureus is common in the community, but the organism can also cause a variety of infections. S. aureus is the most common cause of skin and soft tissue infections, including wound infections, abscesses, furuncles, carbuncles, and impetigo and is a major cause of cellulitis. It can also cause deep-seated infections such as osteomyelitis, endocarditis, pneumonia, and septicemia. Toxigenic strains can cause toxic shock, staphylococcal scalded-skin syndrome (SSSS), and staphylococcal food poisoning.

More than 70 different potential virulence factors have been identified in S. aureus, including adhesins, exoenzymes, and exotoxins. Exfoliative toxins are associated with impetigo and SSSS, and production of Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) toxin has been associated with invasive strains that cause abscesses, bone and joint infection, and pneumonia. In the 1950s, PVL production was associated with particularly invasive infections caused by the penicillin-resistant phage-type 80/81 strain. More recently, in 2006, a review of data on isolates referred to the Health Protection Agency's Staphylococcal Reference Unit identified 27 deaths in 27 months from infections with invasive PVL-positive S. aureus. These deaths were in previously healthy people with community-onset pneumonia, bacteremia, or severe skin and soft tissue infection. Most were caused by methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA) strains. In view of these data and the wider concern about emerging community-onset methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), we sought to determine whether there had been a generalized increase in 1) community-onset staphylococcal disease severe enough to merit hospitalization and 2) general practice (GP) antimicrobial drug prescribing for skin and soft tissue infections putatively caused by staphylococci.

### Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in food products: cause for concern or case for complacency? [^5d32e201]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2010). Low credibility.

The widespread use of antimicrobial agents, in combination with insufficient infection control measures, is the main driver of the current pandemic of antimicrobial resistance in human pathogens. The use of antimicrobials in food animal production also contributes, because resistant organisms and resistance genes can spread from animals to humans by direct contact or through the food chain. An important, traditionally human, pathogen, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), is currently endemic in many hospitals around the world and has also emerged in the community. Recently, a new reservoir of MRSA has been identified in food production animals and people in contact with these animals. This involves a specific clone, multilocus sequence type 398 (ST398), which has spread extensively among animals. ST398 has also been found in up to 11.9% of retail meat samples in several surveys from different parts of the world, posing a potential threat to human health.

### Characterization of Staphylococcus aureus enterotoxin L [^e52f446e]. Infection and Immunity (2003). Low credibility.

Staphylococcus aureus causes a wide variety of diseases. Major virulence factors of this organism include enterotoxins (SEs) that cause both food poisoning and toxic shock syndrome. Recently, a novel SE, tentatively designated SEL, was identified in a pathogenicity island from a bovine mastitis isolate. The toxin had a molecular weight of 26,000 and an isoelectric point of 8.5. Recombinant SEL shared many biological activities with SEs, including superantigenicity, pyrogenicity, enhancement of endotoxin shock, and lethality in rabbits when administered in subcutaneous miniosmotic pumps, but the protein lacked emetic activity. T cells bearing the T-cell receptor beta chain variable regions 5.1, 5.2, 6.7, 16, and 22 were significantly stimulated by recombinant SEL.

### Preventing staphylococcal (staph) food poisoning… [^2aec0598]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points
- You can take steps to prevent Staph food poisoning.
- Always wash your hands before preparing or serving food.
- Keep food out of the "danger zone" between 40°F and 140°F.
- Refrigerate perishable food after 2 hours. What increases your risk Eating foods held at unsafe temperatures can increase the risk of Staph food poisoning. Foods that are not cooked after handling, such as sliced meats, puddings, pastries, and sandwiches, are especially risky if contaminated with Staph. Prevention tips Information for everyone Reminder Staph and other germs can multiply rapidly in food left at room temperature – or in the "danger zone" between 40°F and 140°F. After food is cooked, do not keep it at room temperature if it will not be served and eaten soon. Instead, keep it heated to 140°F or hotter or refrigerate it at 40°F or colder.

Perishable food that has been in the "danger zone" should be refrigerated within 2 hours. Get more tips for preventing food poisoning at home.

### Innate defences against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection [^b643c1f3]. The Journal of Pathology (2006). Low credibility.

The innate immune system is the primary defence against bacterial infection. Among the factors involved in innate defence, anti-microbial peptides produced by humans have recently attracted attention due to their relevance to some diseases and also to the development of new chemotherapeutic agents. Staphylococcus aureus is one of the major human pathogens, causing a variety of infections from suppurative disease to food poisoning. Methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) is a clinical problem and with the recent emergence of a vancomycin-resistant strain, this will pose serious problems in the near future. In investigating the molecular biology of S. aureus infections to develop new chemotherapeutic agents against MRSA infections, knowledge of the interaction of innate anti-microbial peptides with S. aureus is important. In vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrate that exposure of S. aureus to host cells can induce the anti-microbial peptides beta-defensin-2 (hBD2), hBD3, and LL37/CAP18. The induction level of these peptides differs among strains, as does the susceptibility of the strains, with MRSA strains exhibiting lower susceptibility. In summary, the susceptibility of S. aureus strains, including MRSA strains, to components of the innate immune system varies, with the MRSA strains showing more resistance to both innate immune factors and chemotherapeutic agents.

### Human health risks associated with antimicrobial-resistant enterococci and Staphylococcus aureus on poultry meat [^46b844c3]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2016). Low credibility.

Enterococci and staphylococci are frequent contaminants on poultry meat. Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium and Staphylococcus aureus are also well-known aetiological agents of a wide variety of infections resulting in major healthcare costs. This review provides an overview of the human health risks associated with the occurrence of these opportunistic human pathogens on poultry meat with particular focus on the risk of food-borne transmission of antimicrobial resistance. In the absence of conclusive evidence of transmission, this risk was inferred using data from scientific articles and national reports on prevalence, bacterial load, antimicrobial resistance and clonal distribution of these three species on poultry meat. The risks associated with ingestion of antimicrobial-resistant enterococci of poultry origin comprise horizontal transfer of resistance genes and transmission of multidrug-resistant E. faecalis lineages such as sequence type ST16. Enterococcus faecium lineages occurring in poultry meat products are distantly related to those causing hospital-acquired infections but may act as donors of quinupristin/dalfopristin resistance and other resistance determinants of clinical interest to the human gut microbiota. Ingestion of poultry meat contaminated with S. aureus may lead to food poisoning. However, antimicrobial resistance in the toxin-producing strains does not have clinical implications because food poisoning is not managed by antimicrobial therapy. Recently methicillin-resistant S. aureus of livestock origin has been reported on poultry meat. In theory handling or ingestion of contaminated meat is a potential risk factor for colonization by methicillin-resistant S. aureus. However, this risk is presently regarded as negligible by public health authorities.

### Severe MRSA enterocolitis caused by a strain harboring enterotoxins D, G, and I [^710aa51b]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

In previous reported cases of MRSA enterocolitis, few authors reported the presence of Staphylococcus toxins, mainly enterotoxin A. Although enterotoxin A is the most common toxin in Staphylococcus -related food poisoning, the enterotoxin D we found is reported to be the second most common, supporting its role in this patient's enterocolitis. Enterotoxins G and I are not as well-studied but were associated with a food poisoning outbreak in Taiwan. Staphylococcal enterotoxins G and I induce enterocolitis by a combination of direct enterocyte cytopathy mediated by epidermal cell differentiation inhibitor toxins (disrupting the epithelial barrier) and enterotoxin superantigen-induced mucosal T-cell activation.

The risk factors for S. aureus enterocolitis include age, hospitalization, abdominal surgery, immunosuppression, gastric acid suppression, MRSA colonization, and previous antibiotic therapy. Fluoroquinolone use seems to be particularly associated with this complication. MRSA enterocolitis might be an underrecognized cause of AAC because stool culture in patients hospitalized for > 72 hours has been discouraged. MRSA enterocolitis should be considered once C. difficile colitis and Klebsiella oxytoca colitis have been ruled out. Physicians should consider stool cultures for severe or prolonged AAC, and microbiology laboratories should report S. aureus overgrowth in stool. Oral vancomycin was effective in this case and seems to be the consensus choice for therapy based on previous reports.

### Staphylococcal enterotoxins G and I, a cause of severe but reversible neonatal enteropathy [^d17c09cf]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2008). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

Staphylococcus aureus is recognized to produce toxins A-E and toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 associated with food poisoning and toxic shock syndrome. Enterotoxins G and I co-exist in the same S aureus strains (staphylococcal enterotoxin G and staphylococcal enterotoxin I) and are implicated in scarlet fever and toxic shock. We report these enterotoxins as causative agents of 2 cases of neonatal intractable diarrhea with enteropathy.

Methods

We used a note review for this study. Stool culture, multiplex polymerase chain reaction for enterotoxin, duodenal biopsy specimens for H&E, periodic acid-Schiff staining, and electron microscopy were used.

Results

Infant 1 had diarrhea from age 2 weeks and was referred at age 5 weeks with weight less than the 0.4th percentile. Infant 2 was referred at age 7 weeks with 4 weeks' of diarrhea, weight less than the 0.4th percentile. Both infants were severely malnourished. Elemental feeds were not tolerated and total parenteral nutrition was required. S aureus producing staphylococcal enterotoxin G and staphylococcal enterotoxin I was isolated in stools from both infants. Clinical improvement occurred after intravenous flucloxacillin and parenteral nutrition. Histology showed subtotal villous atrophy (H&E) with abnormal brush border (periodic acid-Schiff). Electron microscopy showed severe microvilli destruction, dilated mitochondria, and lysosomes containing cellular debris. Repeat histology was normal in infant 2, age 3 months, off parenteral nutrition, showed return to normal. Currently, both infants are 2 years of age and are thriving on a normal diet.

Conclusions

Staphylococcal enterotoxin G- and I-induced enteropathy is a life-threatening condition, causing reversible disruption of enterocyte ultrastructure that responds well to supportive treatment with flucloxacillin and parenteral nutrition This condition should be a differential diagnosis of neonatal early onset diarrhea.

From 1998 to 2008, 1229 foodborne outbreaks caused by Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens, and Staphylococcus aureus were reported in the United States; 39% were reported with a confirmed etiology. Vomiting was commonly reported in B. cereus (median, 75% of cases) and S. aureus outbreaks (median, 87%), but rarely in C. perfringens outbreaks (median, 9%). Meat or poultry dishes were commonly implicated in C. perfringens (63%) and S. aureus (55%) outbreaks, and rice dishes were commonly implicated in B. cereus outbreaks (50%). Errors in food processing and preparation were commonly reported (93%), regardless of etiology; contamination by a food worker was only common in S. aureus outbreaks (55%). Public health interventions should focus on these commonly reported errors to reduce the occurrence of outbreaks caused by B. cereus, C. perfringens, and S. aureus in the United States.

Introduction

Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is one of the greatest threats to human health, necessitating effective surveillance. Staphylococcus aureus is an important antimicrobial-resistant bacterium. It's spread in healthcare and community settings, and in the livestock industry, is a global challenge because S. aureus causes diverse pathologies, from skin and soft tissue infections to systemic invasive diseases, such as pneumonia, septicemia, infective endocarditis, osteomyelitis, toxic shock syndrome, and food poisoning through its enterotoxin. Bloodstream infection (BSI) caused by S. aureus is a severe condition with an increased mortality risk. An estimated 119,247 S. aureus BSIs with 19,832 associated deaths occurred in the United Statesin 2017. The number of BSI deaths attributed to S. aureus in Japan was 17,412 in 2011 and 17,157 in 2017, wherein 5924 (34%) deaths were attributed to methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) in 2011, which significantly decreased to 4224 (24.6%) in 2017.

### An outbreak of community-acquired foodborne illness caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus [^5f27dfe4]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

MRSA was isolated from a food handler involved in this outbreak, and an MSSA strain with an identical PFGE pattern was subsequently isolated. The strain obtained on follow-up retained the mec-A gene and probably represents a genetic mutation in a regulatory region. Shortly after the outbreak, another food handler was carrying two strains of MSSA with a PFGE pattern very similar to the outbreak strain of MRSA. These strains appear to be related to the outbreak strain but with loss of the mec-A determinant. The existence of multiple strains of S. aureus in persons involved in this outbreak is not surprising, as 20% to 40% of adults are estimated to be colonized at any time, and multiple strains may be present in the same person. Colonization with MRSA carries a greater risk for infection than does colonization with MSSA.

This outbreak suggests that as MRSA becomes increasingly common in the community, it will be implicated in expressions of all the clinical manifestations of staphylococcal infection. While antibiotic-resistant strains are not expected to be clinically more virulent or challenging in the setting of acute outbreaks of gastroenteritis, MRSA may cause soft-tissue and other infections in the community that are difficult to treat. This episode demonstrates the spread of MRSA into the community and is a harbinger of the increasing impact of health-care-associated organisms in settings and among populations previously considered to be unthreatened by this emerging antimicrobial-resistant pathogen.

### Biochemical and biological properties of staphylococcal enterotoxin K [^2b0baf2e]. Infection and Immunity (2001). Low credibility.

Staphylococcus aureus is an important human pathogen which is implicated in a wide variety of diseases. Major determinants of the virulence of this organism include extracellular virulence factors. Staphylococcal enterotoxins (SEs) are important causative agents in staphylococcal toxic shock syndrome and food poisoning. Our study identified a novel enterotoxin, SEK, and examined its biochemical and biological properties. SEK had a molecular weight of 26,000 and an experimentally determined pI of between 7.0 and 7.5. SEK was secreted by clinical isolates of S. aureus. We demonstrated that SEK had many of the biological activities associated with the SEs, including superantigenicity, pyrogenicity, the ability to enhance the lethal effect of endotoxin, and lethality in a rabbit model when administered by subcutaneous miniosmotic pump. Recombinant SEK was shown to stimulate human CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells in a Vbeta-specific manner; T-cells bearing Vbeta 5.1, 5.2, and 6.7 were significantly stimulated to proliferate.

### Detection of seg, seh, and sei genes in Staphylococcus aureus isolates and determination of the enterotoxin productivities of S. aureus isolates harboring seg, seh, or sei genes [^e98c33c5]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2002). Low credibility.

To investigate the distribution of staphylococcal enterotoxin (SE) A to I (SEA to SEI) genes (sea to sei) in Staphylococcus aureus, 146 isolates obtained in Japan from humans involved in and samples from food poisoning outbreaks, healthy humans, cows with mastitis, and bovine raw milk were analyzed by multiplex PCR. One hundred thirteen (77.4%) S. aureus isolates were found to be positive for one or more se genes. The se genotype was classified into 14 genotypes. seg and sei coexisted in the same S. aureus strain. The newly developed sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay showed that most seh-harboring S. aureus isolates were able to produce a significant amount of SEH. However, most of the S. aureus isolates harboring seg and about 60% of the isolates harboring sei did not produce a detectable level of SEG or SEI, while reverse transcription-PCR analysis proved that the mRNAs of SEG and SEI were transcribed in S. aureus strains harboring seg and sei genes. These results suggest the importance of quantitative assessment of SEG and SEI production in foods in order to clarify the relationship between these new SEs and food poisoning.

IDSA infectious diarrhea — clinical presentations and likely etiologies are listed as follows: Persistent or chronic diarrhea has likely pathogens including Cryptosporidium spp. Giardia lamblia, Cyclospora cayetanensis, Cystoisospora belli, and Entamoeba histolytica. Visible blood in stool lists STEC (Shiga toxin–producing Escherichia coli), Shigella, Salmonella, Campylobacter, Entamoeba histolytica, noncholera Vibrio species, Yersinia, Balantidium coli, and Plesiomonas as likely pathogens. Fever is not highly discriminatory — viral, bacterial, and parasitic infections can cause fever; in general, higher temperatures are suggestive of bacterial or E. histolytica, and patients infected with STEC usually are not febrile at time of presentation. Severe abdominal pain, often with grossly bloody stools (occasionally nonbloody) and minimal or no fever, lists STEC, Salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter, and Yersinia enterocolitica as likely pathogens. Persistent abdominal pain and fever lists Y. enterocolitica and Y. pseudotuberculosis and may mimic appendicitis. Nausea and vomiting within ≤ 24 hours suggests ingestion of Staphylococcus aureus enterotoxin or Bacillus cereus (short-incubation emetic syndrome). Diarrhea and abdominal cramping lasting 1–2 days suggests ingestion of Clostridium perfringens or B. cereus (long-incubation diarrheal syndrome). Vomiting and nonbloody diarrhea lasting 2–3 days lists norovirus as the likely pathogen.

The products were distributed locally, nationally, or internationally and were sold not only by national chain retail stores and food services but also at farm stands and small health food stores carrying organic and "natural" products. Most of these recalls followed identification of bacterial contamination of a food or beverage, but in some instances, the contamination was associated with reported human illnesses. The contaminating pathogens most commonly identified in food recalls were Listeria monocytogenes, STEC, and Salmonella; the latter two were associated most frequently with recalls resulting from the investigation of human illness, and additional products were recalled because of contamination (or potential contamination) with Cronobacter sakazakii and bacterial toxins (e.g. Clostridium botulinum neurotoxin, Staphylococcus aureus enterotoxin, and Bacillus cereus toxin).

Food Preparation Findings

Food for the July 30 lunch party was purchased during July 27–28, with the exception of the pork, which was purchased approximately 1 week earlier. All perishable products (chicken thighs, chicken wings, breakfast sausage, and pork) were stored in a freezer.

Perlo

On July 29, the raw chicken thighs and sausage were defrosted in the microwave. The defrosted chicken thighs were cooked in a stock pot of boiling water. After cooling, the chicken was removed from the thigh bones by hand and placed back into the stock pot. Sausage was cooked in a skillet and added to the pot. Onions and other seasonings were sautéed in the sausage oil and added to the pot. To complete the perlo, rice was added to the stock pot and cooked until all remaining water was absorbed. The pot of cooked perlo then was placed in an unheated oven for approximately 8 hours overnight. On the morning of July 30, the perlo was found to be warm. It was transferred to a slow cooker for reheating for approximately 1 hour on a high setting before transport and consumption.

Chicken wings

On July 28, the raw chicken wings were defrosted in the refrigerator overnight. On July 29, they were seasoned and placed back in the refrigerator. On the morning of July 30, they were fried and placed in a foil-covered pan for transport and consumption on July 30.

Pulled pork

The raw pork was defrosted in the microwave on July 29 and cooked overnight in a slow cooker for approximately 8 hours on a low setting before transport and consumption on July 30.

### An allergist's approach to food poisoning [^6adf52e1]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2023). Medium credibility.

Foodborne illnesses represent a significant global health concern. These preventable diseases lead to substantial mortality and morbidity worldwide. Substantial overlap with food allergy exists with similar clinical presentations and symptom onset. Knowledge of the typically implicated microorganisms and toxins can help properly identify these diseases. A thorough history is essential to differentiate between these 2 disorders. The types of food implicated may be similar including milk, egg, fish, and shellfish. The timing of symptom onset may overlap and lead to misdiagnosis of disorders such as food protein-induced enterocolitis syndrome. Classically, histamine-related food poisoning is also typically confused with true food allergy and may be seen as related to fish and cheese. Knowledge of epidemiology, patterns, and etiology of allergic conditions and foodborne illness may help the allergist differentiate among these common diseases.

### A murine model of ulcerative colitis: induced with sinusitis-derived superantigen and food allergen [^35f895c0]. BMC Gastroenterology (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a disease characterized by inflammation and ulcers in the mucosa of the large intestine with unknown etiology. The inflammation usually occurs in the rectum and lower part of the colon, but it may affect the entire colon. The inflammation speeds up colonic motility and causes diarrhea. Ulcers form in places where the inflammation has killed the cells lining the colon; the ulcers bleed and produce pus. Theories about what causes ulcerative colitis abound, but none have been proven. The most popular theory is that the body's immune system reacts to a virus or a bacterium causing ongoing inflammation in the intestinal mucosa; others include genetic predisposition, autoimmune disorders and impaired immune regulation.

over the past 15 years, more than 2000 patients with chronic sinusitis (CS) including some patients with both CS and UC visited our clinic and were treated with different remedies, including medical treatment and functional sinus endoscopic surgery (FESS). Apart from improvement of chronic sinusitis, those patients with both CS and UC showed great improvement of UC as well (data not shown) that couldn't be explained with the specific treatment alone. Therefore, we postulated that there might be an association between CS and UC in these patients. Microbial infection is the most common cause of CS. The microbial products, such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS), staphylococcus aureus enterotoxin B (SEB) can be discharged into the nasal cavity through the natural ostia going backward to the pharynx, and then be swallowed, entering the gastrointestinal tract to affect mucosal physiological functions.

Staphylococcus enterotoxin B is an extracellular toxin produced by certain strains of Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus). Many cases of food poisoning worldwide involve S. aureus enterotoxins. In addition, enterotoxins can be found in cases of toxic shock syndrome and have been implicated in the autoimmune disease rheumatoid arthritis. SEB is synthesized as a precursor protein of 266 amino acids. This precursor is then activated during excretion by cleavage of the N-terminal portion of the molecule. The active enterotoxin B is a single 239 amino acid chain of molecular weight 28,000 daltons and isoelectric point of 8.6. SEB is a superantigen and possesses powerful immune regulatory capability that results in increased T cell activation and proliferation. SEB-treated Balb/c mice display a dose-dependent colonic inflammation. SEB can also induce colonic epithelial barrier dysfunction that may promote uptake of exogenous antigens, microbial products and other noxious substances into the intestinal tissue to contact immune cells and initiate inappropriate immune reactions.

### Identification and characterization of two novel staphylococcal enterotoxins, types S and T [^bd9c401b]. Infection and Immunity (2008). Low credibility.

In addition to two known staphylococcal enterotoxin-like genes (selj and selr), two novel genes coding for two superantigens, staphylococcal enterotoxins S and T (SES and SET), were identified in plasmid pF5, which is harbored by food poisoning-related Staphylococcus aureus strain Fukuoka 5. This strain was implicated in a food poisoning incident in Fukuoka City, Japan, in 1997. Recombinant SES (rSES) specifically stimulated human T cells in a T-cell receptor Vbeta9- and Vbeta16-specific manner in the presence of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II(+) antigen-presenting cells (APC). rSET also stimulated T cells in the presence of MHC class II(+) APC, although its Vbeta skewing was not found in reactive T cells. Subsequently, we examined the emetic activity of SES and SET. We also studied SElR to determine emetic activity in primates. This toxin was identified in previous studies but was not examined in terms of possession of emetic activity for primates. rSES induced emetic reactions in two of four monkeys at a dose of 100 microg/kg within 5 h of intragastric administration. In one monkey, rSET induced a delayed reaction (24 h postadministration) at a dose of 100 microg/kg, and in the other one, the reaction occurred 5 days postadministration. rSElR induced a reaction in two of six animals within 5 h at 100 microg/kg. On this basis, we speculate that the causative toxins of vomiting in the Fukuoka case are SES and SER. Additionally, SES, SER, and SET also induced emesis in house musk shrews as in the monkeys.

### A one-year study of foodborne illnesses in the municipality of uppsala, Sweden [^13d20504]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

Surveillance was enhanced and a retrospective interview study performed in 1998–99 to determine incidence, causes, and costs of foodborne illnesses in Uppsala, Sweden. Sixty-eight percent of the detected foodborne illness incidents were single cases, and 32% were outbreaks. Most (85%) of the incidents came to the attention of the municipal authorities through telephone calls from affected persons. Calicivirus, Campylobacter spp., and Staphyloccocus aureus were the most common etiological agents; meat, meat products, and mixed dishes were the most implicated food categories. The incidence of foodborne illness was estimated to be 38 cases per 1,000 inhabitants per year. The estimated average costs per illness were 2,164 Swedish Krona (SEK) ($246) to society and 500 SEK ($57) to the patient. The annual cost of foodborne illnesses in Sweden was estimated to be 1,082 million SEK ($123 million).

### Guidelines for foodborne disease outbreak response. 2nd ed [^4c805c90]. CDC (2014). Medium credibility.

Overview of Chapter 2. Fundamental concepts of public health surveillance and foodborne disease — clinical presentation and incubation are described: illnesses from preformed toxins manifest rapidly, often in a matter of minutes or hours, and the most common symptom is vomiting; illnesses caused by infections take longer, ranging from hours to days or weeks; symptoms usually include diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal cramps; fever and an elevated white blood cell count also can occur. Because certain pathogens are commonly associated with certain foods, the suspected food in an outbreak can occasionally suggest a particular disease agent, but most foods can be associated with a variety of pathogens and new vehicles emerge each year, so care must be taken in inferring an etiologic agent on the basis of a suspected food.

In healthy adults and children in developed countries, most foodborne and water-borne infections are short-lived and resolve without specific treatment. In developing areas, these infections may produce acute mortality and chronic morbidity caused by developmental impairment. Immune-compromised hosts are at increased risk of life-threatening complications. This article reviews recommendations for the treatment of the most common and important foodborne illnesses, focusing on those caused by infections or toxins of microbial origin. The cornerstone of life-saving treatment remains oral rehydration therapy, although the use of other supportive measures as well as antibiotics for certain infections is also recommended.

### Staphylococcus aureus enterotoxins induce IL-8 secretion by human nasal epithelial cells [^d81410c5]. Respiratory Research (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) is a common human pathogen associated with various local and systemic infections, characterized by inflammation dominated by polymorphonuclear leukocytes. It produces a set of toxins including staphylococcal enterotoxins and toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 which cause food poisoning and toxic shock syndrome respectively in humans and other species. These toxins are intermediate molecular weight proteins (22–20 kD) that also act as superantigens (SAgs) due to their ability to bind to MHC class II molecules on antigen presenting cells and stimulate all T cells bearing particular V βs on their T cell receptors.

The epithelium acts as a physiological barrier to diffusion and after physical or chemical damage has occurred, inhaled allergens, irritants and agonists can have detrimental effects on the underlying smooth muscle. Traditionally, the epithelium was considered to be an inert barrier dividing the external environment and the inner tissue of the lung. However, it is now accepted that it constitutes the interface between the internal milieu and the external environment and plays a pivotal role in controlling many airway functions including barrier and secretory functions. Airway hyper-responsiveness and epithelial cell damage are associated commonly with asthma.

In view of the ever increasing evidence for the effects of staphylococcal superantigens on immuno-modulatory and pro-inflammatory cells, it is likely that there is an association between staphylococcal infection and the pathogenesis of atopic diseases such as dermatitis, rhinitis and asthma. Enterotoxins produced by S. aureus and their specific IgE antibodies are thought to be important in worsening atopic dermatitis.

Studies have shown greater S. aureus colonisation in the skin of patients with atopic eczema/dermatitis syndrome (AEDS) (80–100%) than in the skin of normal healthy subjects (5–30%). Indeed S. aureus constitutes up to 80% of the normal flora in atopic individuals and S. aureus isolated from the skin of at least 65% of AEDS patients secretes the Sags, S. aureus enterotoxin A (SEA), S. aureus enterotoxin B (SEB), S. aureus enterotoxin C (SEC), S. aureus enterotoxin D (SED) and Toxic Shock Syndrome Toxin-1 (TSST-1).

Food safety

Food poisoning

Some foods more commonly cause food poisoning than others, including raw or undercooked meat and poultry, raw seafood, raw or undercooked eggs, raw (unpasteurized) milk and soft cheeses made from raw milk, raw flour, and uncooked or unwashed fruits and vegetables. A variety of germs can contaminate these foods and cause illness, such as norovirus and bacteria such as E. coli and Salmonella. CDC estimates that 48 million people in the US become ill due to foodborne infections every year. These infections can spread directly from person-to-person and through contaminated foods.

Depending on the germ causing the illness, symptoms may appear within 30 minutes to up to 7 days after ingestion. Typical symptoms of food poisoning include nausea, vomiting, cramps or abdominal pain, diarrhea, and may also include fever. In mild cases, symptoms last for 24–72 hours. In more severe cases, vomiting and diarrhea may be prolonged, people may become dehydrated due to a lack of adequate fluid intake, diarrhea may be bloody, and fever may be higher than 39 degrees Celsius (102 degrees Fahrenheit).

Anyone can get food poisoning. Most people who do have mild cases. However, some people are at higher risk of more severe disease. These higher risk individuals are those whose immune systems are not functioning normally. Individuals in this category include children under 5 years old, individuals who are pregnant, adults aged 65 years or older, anyone who may be receiving immunosuppressive treatments, such as cancer or transplant patients, and patients with HIV/AIDS, diabetes, or liver or kidney disease.

"Are multiple cases being attributed to the same exposure?" "Are all of the illnesses similar (suggesting that all are the same disease)?" "Could these illnesses be reasonably explained by other common exposures?" If multiple complaints share the same incubation period and consistent symptoms, "the complaints might represent an outbreak and need to be investigated".

### Probable enterotoxin-associated toxic shock syndrome caused by Staphylococcus epidermidis [^91c80f18]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

We describe a case of a toxic shock-like syndrome in a child, which was associated with Staphylococcus epidermidis instead of Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes, the usual causes of toxic shock syndrome.

Case Presentation

The patient was an 8-year-old boy who developed a toxic shock syndrome-like illness, including fever, hypotension, and rash. The Staphylococcus epidermidis isolate was cultured from urine, but this organism was unavailable for toxin testing. Multiple blood cultures were negative. Instead, a highly novel assay was used on acute plasma from the patient which demonstrated the presence of the genes for superantigens, staphylococcal enterotoxins A, C, D, and E. Superantigens are the known causes of toxic shock syndrome.

Conclusions

Our study suggests strongly that Staphylococcus epidermidis was causing the TSS symptoms through the known Staphylococcus aureus superantigens. It is unknown how many other such patients exist; this should be explored. Of great importance is that PCR performed directly on blood plasma in the absence of microbial isolation could be used to demonstrate superantigen genes.

Comparison of Bacterial and NoV Outbreaks

We compared selected epidemiologic and clinical features of NoV outbreaks (n = 136), bacterial outbreaks (n = 173), and outbreaks of unknown etiology (n = 907), when information was complete. Of the 173 bacterial outbreaks, 79 (46%) were attributed to Salmonella spp. 27 (16%) to Clostridium spp. 20 (12%) to Staphylococcus aureus, 19 (11%) to Shigella spp. 13 (8%) to Escherichia coli, 7 (4%) to Bacillus cereus, 6 (3%) to Campylobacter spp. and 2 (1%) to other bacterial pathogens.

NoV outbreaks were significantly larger than outbreaks of bacterial or unknown etiology (median number of cases per outbreak = 25 versus 15 and 7, respectively. Wilcoxon rank sum test: p < 0.001) (Table). Viral outbreaks had a shorter duration of illness compared to bacterial outbreaks but one similar to that of outbreaks of unknown etiology (median duration < 48 hours = 82%, 40%, and 85%, respectively). Vomiting was more often a predominant symptom (reported by > 50% of ill persons) in NoV outbreaks than in outbreaks of bacterial or unknown etiology (p = 0.001) and was reported in all 136 NoV outbreaks. Fever, however, was less often reported in outbreaks of NoV disease.

The median incubation period was significantly longer in outbreaks of NoV gastroenteritis: 85% of these outbreaks featured a median incubation period > 24 hours compared with 39% in outbreaks of bacterial cause and 43% in outbreaks of unknown etiology. This finding is largely explained by outbreaks caused by preformed toxins from certain bacteria (S. aureus, Clostridium perfringens, B. cereus), which tend to have shorter incubation periods.

### An outbreak of community-acquired foodborne illness caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus [^f1d62971]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

Methods

Ill family members were interviewed by the local health department, and an environmental inspection was performed at the market where the food was purchased. Market employees were interviewed, and stool cultures were obtained from the three ill persons. Specimens of barbequed pork and coleslaw were collected from the market, and nasopharyngeal swabs were collected for culture from three food preparers. Follow-up nasopharyngeal cultures were obtained from one ill family member 8 months after her acute illness to assess persistent carriage.

Twelve cultures of S. aureus recovered from stool samples of the ill family members, food specimens, and nasal swabs of the food preparers were sent to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for further testing. The identification of all S. aureus isolates was confirmed by conventional biochemical tests, and all isolates were screened for methicillin resistance by using a 1-µg oxacillin disk. Five of the 12 isolates appeared to be methicillin resistant by disk diffusion. Oxacillin susceptibility of the isolates was confirmed by broth microdilutionwith plates read manually. All isolates were tested for staphylococcal enterotoxins by the use of a reversed passive latex agglutination test (Oxoid Ltd. Hampshire, UK). Molecular typing of all isolates was performed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) with Sma I-digested chromosomal DNA. Gels were interpreted by standard criteria.

### -induced liver abscess with severe haemolysis [^ed9dffd0]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

Clostridium perfringens is notorious for causing skin and soft tissue infections and food poisoning. Rarely, C. perfringens infections are associated with severe haemolysis, with a mortality rate of > 80%. A previously healthy man in his 70s who presented with fever as his chief symptom was promptly admitted to a regional core hospital. Over the next 3hours, shock and multiple organ failure ensued, leading to referral to our hospital for intensive care. We suspected a liver abscess caused by C. perfringens infection with haemolysis, findings of severe haemolysis and a liver mass with gas production that appeared within a few hours. Though surgical drainage was contemplated, low blood pressure resulted in death within 3hours of arrival at our hospital. The next day, a blood culture confirmed C. perfringens, proving the diagnosis. Improving patient outcomes requires increased awareness of the disease and early detection.

### An outbreak of community-acquired foodborne illness caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus [^8d94973b]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

Food handler C, who was carrying the outbreak strain of MRSA, performed various tasks at the store, including preparing foods and handling barbecued pork and coleslaw. She reported no recent gastrointestinal illness nor chronic health problems, history of admission to a hospital, or use of antibiotics in the previous 6 months. She also denied close contact with persons who lived or worked in health-care facilities or other group settings. She did, however, visit an elderly relative, who resided in a nursing home, approximately 2 to 3 times each month before the outbreak. She reported that this person had a staphylococcal infection and had subsequently died. The employee refused to identify her relative, and further medical information or isolates from that person were not available.

A follow-up nasopharyngeal culture was collected from family member C approximately 8 months after her acute illness. This culture was positive for two different strains of MSSA, but not MRSA. One isolate was indistinguishable by PFGE from that of the MRSA strain isolated from the same patient during the outbreak. This isolate produced enterotoxin C, as did the strain of MRSA she was previously carrying. Polymerase chain reaction testing of this isolate confirmed that it carried the mecA gene, suggesting that the original MRSA strain had reverted to MSSA by loss of a regulatory region. The other isolate, which produced enterotoxin D, was determined by PFGE to be unrelated to any of the other strains previously seen in this investigation.

### Laboratory exposures to staphylococcal enterotoxin B [^8c1a6bad]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

During the offensive biologic warfare program, a contractor report addressing the efficacy of biosafety cabinets noted toxic reactions in persons performing SEB purification studies on open laboratory benches. The following symptoms were noted in six persons: conjunctivitis, nondescript chemical irritation of one eye, general skin reaction, severe facial skin reaction, dermatitis, and cold symptoms. Additionally, symptoms mainly of conjunctivitis and acute pharyngitis, but also including vomiting and diarrhea in two cases, were observed in 23 persons wearing surgical masks or face shields while working with SEB. Persons working with SEB within a biosafety cabinet had no symptoms.

As exposure to low dosages of SEB can produce symptoms, these recently reported symptoms have importance both to safety officers and healthcare workers evaluating laboratory workers at risk with potential exposures to staphylococcal enterotoxins. SEB intoxication can mimic an infectious process. The initial diagnosis of the first person who sought medical evaluation in the June 1963 incident was pneumococcal pneumonia; symptoms included acute onset of fever, chills, productive cough, chest pain, and dyspnea. The patient was started on penicillin, which was discontinued after his co-workers exhibited similar symptoms, a finding that supported the diagnosis of SEB intoxication. Even though medical providers had knowledge of SEB exposure in a subsequently hospitalized patient involved in the June 1963 incident, the initial symptoms of this patient still raised concern about a possible infectious cause. That patient was noted to have a flushed face, mild hyperemia of the pharynx, a prominent postnasal drip, a purulent-appearing otitis media and externa without symptoms of ear pain, pulmonary symptoms (productive cough and chest discomfort), and a leukocytosis of 19,500 cells/mm³. Their differential diagnosis included otitis externa and media, pneumonia, or SEB intoxication. Otic examination was within normal limits 24 hours later, which suggested SEB as the possible cause of the localized swelling. An infectious cause was also considered as the initial primary diagnosis in the initial two patients with conjunctivitis in this series as the cause of the conjunctivitis, gastrointestinal symptoms, or both, with both persons receiving topical ophthalmic antimicrobial agents for conjunctivitis. Healthcare workers evaluating persons who work with SEB need to be aware of the full spectrum of toxicity symptoms associated with SEB to avoid misdiagnosis resulting in unnecessary treatment, to identify breaches in laboratory technique, and to educate persons at risk of the importance of personal protective measures in preventing SEB exposure and intoxication. These cases emphasize that personal protective measures such as biosafety cabinets, gloves, and eye protection are paramount when working with SEB.

### Signs and symptoms of food allergy and food-induced anaphylaxis [^1031e5e1]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Food allergies are increasing in prevalence. In order for pediatric clinicians to appropriately diagnose and manage food allergies, the characteristic signs and symptoms of these potentially severe reactions must be recognized. Unlike nonimmunologic adverse food reactions (such as lactose intolerance and food poisoning), food allergies by definition are immune-mediated responses that occur reproducibly on food ingestion. The varying clinical presentations of food allergy include IgE-mediated disorders, mixed IgE- and cell-mediated disorders, and cell-mediated food allergies. This review describes the clinical manifestations of each of these categories of food allergy, with special emphasis on recognition of food-induced anaphylaxis.

### Estimated annual numbers of foodborne pathogen-associated illnesses, hospitalizations, and deaths, France, 2008–2013 [^7a845a80]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

We estimated the number of most pathogen-specific illnesses by using laboratory-based surveillance data corrected for underreporting and underdiagnosis, and we used well-documented estimates for Campylobacter spp. and Salmonella spp. We assumed that the parameters regarding healthcare-seeking behavior and laboratory practice for Yersinia spp. and Shigella spp. were similar to those for Campylobacter spp. and Salmonella spp. respectively. The validity of these assumptions is difficult to explore; further studies would be needed to produce more robust estimates of the true level of underdiagnosis for these 2 pathogens in France.

For B. cereus, C. perfringens, and S. aureus, we assumed that the multiplier between the number of outbreak cases and the number of foodborne illnesses would be similar to that for Salmonella spp. An alternative approach for C. perfringens would have been to apply a proportion of acute gastroenteritis cases by this pathogen estimated in the United Kingdom (0.3–1.7%) to the annual number of acute gastroenteritis illnesses in France. This approach would result in an estimate (CrI 90% 84,450–278,964) within the range of the estimate in our study. The estimates for B. cereus, C. perfringens, and S. aureus indicate that the effect of these pathogens in terms of foodborne illnesses appears to be high in France. However, only foodborne illness outbreak data were available to estimate the number of illnesses for these pathogens, and more data are needed to confirm our estimates.

### Survey of genes encoding staphylococcal enterotoxins, toxic shock syndrome toxin 1, and exfoliative toxins in members of the Staphylococcus sciuri group [^4d30044c]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2005). Low credibility.

Genes encoding staphylococcal enterotoxins (sea to see, seg, and seh), toxic shock syndrome toxin 1 (tst), and exfoliative toxins (eta and etb) were not detected in a large panel of 48 Staphylococcus sciuri group isolates tested. This strongly suggests that production of the staphylococcal exotoxins by these bacteria is highly unlikely.

### Probable enterotoxin-associated toxic shock syndrome caused by Staphylococcus epidermidis [^5dbe6326]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Coagulase-negative staphylococci may be under-appreciated as a cause of toxic shock syndrome. It has been shown many times that such coagulase-negative staphylococci do not produce TSST-1. However, coagulase-negative staphylococci are capable of secreting a number of staphylococcal enterotoxins and cytotoxins, normally produced by S. aureus.

The isolation of staphylococcal toxins from infant urine samples has been postulated as a possible marker of transient bacteremia; toxin genes have been detected by multiplex PCR in S. aureus, both methicillin-sensitive and methicillin-resistant, causing urinary tract infections on a urology ward. In our patient, the detection in plasma of staphylococcal superantigen genes in the presence of a urinary tract coagulase-negative staphylococcus, with potential for producing such toxins, may point to a similar process. It is important that the genes for staphylococcal enterotoxins A, C, D, and E were detected in the plasma of the patient. Staphylococcal enterotoxins A, D, and E are highly related to each other, and the results possibly reflect cross-reactivity. These three superantigens are typically produced in low concentrations, usually in the nanogram to picogram per milliliter range. As little at 0.1 μg of staphylococcal superantigens can cause TSS symptoms.

We report a case of bacteremic nonmenstrual staphylococcal toxic shock syndrome (STSS) producing staphylococcal enterotoxins A and C. The bloodstream isolation of Staphylococcus aureus, as well as the production of enterotoxins A and C, are unusual as separate entities, and distinctly uncommon when found together.

### Food-borne botulism: still actual topic [^8befe626]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

Even though since the mid-1990s the number of food-borne botulism cases has systematically decreased and it now occurs in Poland relatively rarely, it is still a real epidemiological problem. There are about 30 cases of botulism in Poland a year, which ranks Poland the first among the European Union. In most cases the symptomatology of botulism is typical, however it does not always fully coincide with the one described in medical manuals which emphasise the dramatic clinical course of botulism with its frequent fatal consequences. Diagnosis of botulism may be difficult because of its rare prevalence and a variable clinical course, especially in old patients. Authors of this paper describe two cases of botulism and diagnostic problems associated with it.

### Eye-opening approach to norovirus surveillance [^d1c171fa]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

We found 3 striking insights. First, the onset of vomiting in the community precedes the onset of confirmed norovirus infections in healthcare settings. In 3 of the 4 full seasons investigated, this precedence was 1–4 weeks. Second, the curve for the Web queries shows much sharper increases and decreases than does the curve on the number of reported norovirus findings. Third, neither search behavior nor reporting of positive tests is driven by media for the winter vomiting disease (confirmed by a linear regression).

In the 2005–06 season, the laboratory reporting raised above the defined prediction interval in week 13, much later than the Web queries. This season had no new variants of norovirus genotype GII.4. This season still showed community infections, even though few reports came from institutions. For the current season (2009–10), the interval between onset of Web queries and onset of norovirus infections in hospitals (week 46 and week 1, respectively) was 8 weeks. In comparison with previous seasons, this delay could mean a low total number of reported cases. However, in late December, a new variant of GII.4 affected healthcare settings in southern Sweden with increasing norovirus infections, while the rest of the country still showed relatively low virus activity.

Other pathogens such as rotavirus, Salmonella spp. Staphylococcus aureus, and Bacillus cereus can cause vomiting. Usually in Sweden, rotavirus infections peak in late winter, and bacterial diseases have a minor incidence compared with norovirus. In our opinion, these other pathogens would not interfere with the interpretation of the results.

In our routine surveillance of Web queries, we also include other query terms, such as diarrhea and stomach flu. However, searches for vomiting show the most distinct pattern, and vomiting is the most pronounced symptom of a norovirus infection.

The use of harmonic functions for describing baseline Web searches and laboratory reporting is a simple model, especially because the parameters are estimated by using the half-year with the least activity. Nonetheless, it is a direct approach, and we believe that the method still captures the time of onsets well.

### Rhinosinusitis derived staphylococcal enterotoxin B plays a possible role in pathogenesis of food allergy [^1ca6f9e8]. BMC Gastroenterology (2006). Low credibility.

Staphylococcus aureus-derived enterotoxin B (SEB) is one of the superantigens that possess potent stimulatory activity on T lymphocytes. Antigen-independent, polyclonal T cell activation by SEB can worsen inflammatory condition in both Th1 mediated and Th2 mediated diseases including chronic rhinosinusitis. Thus controlling staphylococcal colonization or infection may have therapeutic implications in these conditions. It is reported that prophylactic antibiosis for S. aureus revealed protective effects in atopic dermatitis. However, a role of superantigens in FA is not well understood.

In clinical practice, we have noticed that some patients with both chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) and FA demonstrate significantly amelioration of FA after treatment of CRS that can not be explained with the primary treatment. Our previous studies in rodents revealed that concurrent oral administration of SEB and food antigens (by gavage feeding) induces IgE-mediated reactivity to food antigens in intestinal mucosa. We hypothesized that CRS-derived microbial products (such as SEB) in nasal discharges could be swallowed down the gastrointestinal tract to disturb the immune homeostasis in the local tissue. If our hypothesis is correct, attenuation of FA symptoms is likely to be observed in CRS-FA patients following sinus surgery secondary to reduction of SEB swallowed to the GI tract. We thus examined changes in food allergen reactivity to PST/oral challenge along with other parameters of FA (serum cytokine levels, serum allergen specific IgE, and allergen specific Th2 cells) following sinus surgery in CRS-FA patients in comparison with SEB concentration in the sinus and stool and SEB reactivity.

### An outbreak of community-acquired foodborne illness caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus [^9e5e89b9]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

Results

S. aureus was recovered from the stool cultures of the three ill persons, three samples taken from the barbequed pork, one sample from the coleslaw, and five nasal swabs from three food handlers at the convenience market. Comparison of all the isolates by PFGE showed that five isolates were indistinguishable (Figure). These isolates were those from the stool cultures of three family members (A, B, and C); the coleslaw; and from the nasal swab of food preparer C. This strain produced staphylococcal enterotoxin C and was identified as being MRSA. These isolates were resistant to penicillin and oxacillin but sensitive to all other antibiotics tested. Two different strains of S. aureus recovered from the nasal swab of food preparer B also produced staphylococcal enterotoxin C and differed only slightly from the MRSA strain by PFGE. However, both isolates were methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA). These two isolates were categorized as closely related subtypes of the outbreak strain. The S. aureus isolate recovered from the third food preparer (A) was MSSA, produced staphylococcal enterotoxin A, and was determined by PFGE to be unrelated to the outbreak strain. Although the S. aureus isolates from the samples of pork barbeque each produced staphylococcal enterotoxin C, they were MSSA and unrelated to the outbreak strain by PFGE.

The barbequed pork and coleslaw were prepared at the store where they were purchased. An environmental inspection of the facility performed after the outbreak revealed no apparent lapses in technique or procedure that would have contributed to the outbreak. No additional cases of illness related to this outbreak were reported to the local health department.

### Guidelines for foodborne disease outbreak response. 2nd ed [^4ce626dc]. CDC (2014). Medium credibility.

Determining the etiologic agent in an outbreak — clinical specimens and food testing: Laboratory testing of clinical specimens from patients is critical in determining the etiology of a foodborne disease outbreak; for most foodborne diseases, stool is the specimen of choice, and in an outbreak specimens are collected as soon as possible after onset of symptoms; ideally, specimens from 5–10 persons are collected and tested. Isolation of the etiologic agent from food is challenging, food samples collected during the investigation might not reflect foods eaten at the time of the outbreak, and food testing results should be interpreted with caution. Predominant signs and symptoms and the average incubation period can provide insights into the etiologic agent before laboratory test results are available.

### Probable enterotoxin-associated toxic shock syndrome caused by Staphylococcus epidermidis [^71ea06cf]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion and conclusions

Staphylococcus epidermidis and other coagulase-negative staphylococcal species are most often recognized as pathogens, either in prematurely born infants or in settings of indwelling medical devices, including central lines or bladder catheters. In the absence of such risk factors, certain coagulase-negative staphylococci such as S. saprophyticus are well recognized to cause urinary tract infections in young women. S. epidermidis urinary tract infections in older adults, by contrast, are related to bladder catheterization and can be complicated by bacteremia. Pediatric case reports suggest that S. epidermidis can cause pyelonephritis in children with no predisposing risk factors, and caution is warranted that this organism not be uniformly dismissed as a skin contaminant.

In our patient, with negative blood cultures, the question remains as to the significance of the pure urine culture of S. epidermidis. Even if discounted as a cause of bacteriuria, its presence as a skin colonizer may hold clinical significance in this child, whose clinical presentation including persistent hallucinations is consistent with a toxigenic illness (toxic shock syndrome-like), in whom no other convincing pathogen could be determined, and whose timing of clinical recovery was consistent with an expected response to antibiotics. Neurologic abnormalities are common in cases of TSS. It is formally possible, but highly unlikely, that there was some obscure locus of S. aureus infection which was not observed.

### Foodborne illness outbreaks reported to national surveillance, United States, 2009–2018 [^62b9e48c]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Results

During 2009–2018, a total of 8,131 single-state outbreaks involving 131,525 outbreak-associated illnesses were reported. Of these, 5,986 (74%) had a confirmed or suspected etiology. Causes of the outbreaks included norovirus (2,798; 47%), Salmonella (1,191; 20%), bacterial toxins (617; 10%), and STEC O157 (150; 3%) (Table 1). The etiology was confirmed for 49% of the outbreaks (range across states 21%–84%). The percentage of outbreaks with a confirmed etiology was higher for Salmonella (92%) and STEC (93%) outbreaks than for norovirus (55%) and bacterial toxin (42%) outbreaks. A confirmed or suspected food vehicle was identified for 36% of the total outbreaks (range by state 11%–77%) (Table 1).

Table 1
Single-state foodborne outbreaks reported by US states and Washington, DC, to the Foodborne Disease Outbreak Surveillance System, 2009–2018*

*All etiologies includes reported outbreaks with multiple etiologies. Bacterial toxins include Clostridium perfringens, Bacillus cereus, and Staphylococcus aureus. STEC, Shiga toxin–producing Escherichia coli.

Overall, states reported a mean of 29 outbreaks per 10 million population per year (range by state: 5–86 outbreaks) and a mean of 9 (range 0.5–52) norovirus outbreaks, 5 Salmonella (range 1–11) outbreaks, 3 (range 0.1–8) bacterial toxin outbreaks, and 0.9 (range 0.1–3) STEC O157 outbreaks per 10 million population per year (Table 1; Figure 1). The 10 states with the highest number of reported outbreaks (high reporters) averaged 62 outbreaks per 10 million population per year, whereas the 10 states with the fewest number of reported outbreaks (low reporters) averaged 9 and the remaining 30 states (middle reporters) 24 outbreaks per 10 million population per year (Figure 2). Outbreak reporting quintiles were mostly consistent across pathogens, with the exception of STEC O157 (Figure 2). Among outbreaks with a known etiology other than norovirus, Salmonella, bacterial toxins, and STEC O157, the most common etiologies were fish toxins (433 outbreaks, 33%) and Campylobacter (294 outbreaks, 22%).

Foodborne illness prevention

Food preparation

To reduce the chance of people getting food poisoning, the US CDC and Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommend 4 simple rules: clean, separate, cook, and chill (see Supplementary Material, Figure).

Clean

Rinse fresh fruits and vegetables under running water. Wash your hands before, during, and after meal preparation, especially when handling uncooked meat, poultry, seafood, eggs or flour. After the meal is prepared, wash all used utensils and cutting boards with hot, soapy water either by hand or in a dishwasher. Clean with disinfectant all countertops and other soiled surfaces. Choose a disinfectant marketed for use on kitchen or bathroom surfaces per the disinfectant brand's instructions. Wash your hands before eating.

Separate

Keep uncooked meat, poultry, seafood, and eggs contained apart from ready-to-eat foods when stored in the refrigerator and while being handled during meal preparation on cutting boards, plates, etc. Use appropriate containers to keep juices from raw foods from contacting ready-to-eat foods.

Cook

Cook foods to specific internal temperatures to kill any contaminating germs (see Supplementary Material, Table). Cook microwaved food to an internal temperature of 74°C/165°F. Use food thermometers inserted midway into the food to ensure food has reached appropriate internal temperatures.

Chill

Most bacteria multiply more rapidly at room temperature. To help prevent foodborne illness, refrigerate uncooked perishable food like meat, poultry, seafood, eggs, dairy, fruit, and vegetables, as well as cooked leftovers within 2 hours of being at room temperature. Keep refrigerators at 4°C/40°F or below. Keep freezers –18°C/0°F or below. Discard all foods before they are likely to spoil (see Supplementary Material, Table).

Of note, in this section, our primary focus is on preventing foodborne illnesses from contaminated food products. However, we also emphasize the importance of preventing the transmission of other infectious diseases while handling food for others. Individuals exhibiting respiratory symptoms such as coughing or sneezing, as well as gastrointestinal symptoms like vomiting or diarrhea, may inadvertently contaminate food during preparation and potentially pass on infectious illnesses to others. Therefore, it is strongly recommended that individuals involved in food preparation do not have symptoms of illness, as outlined in Appendicesand.

### Staphylococcal enterotoxins detection methods… [^8badd17a]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

- **June 2017**: New Chapter 13B was added to the Bacteriological Analytical Manual Introduction Staphylococcal food poisoning is an intoxication resulting from consumption of food contaminated with adequate levels of pre-formed enterotoxins. Symptoms of SFP are. manifested within 2–8 hours of ingestion and include nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramping with or without diarrhea that typically resolve within 24–48 hours. The number of people affected by SFP is only an estimate due to misdiagnosis and minor outbreaks that are. not reported. Hospitalization is rare but has been noted in people that are immunocompromised particularly the elderly and very young. Staphylococci are normally present on human skin and mucous membranes with approximately 20–30% for persistent and 60% for intermittent colonization. Food. food products serving as a potential source of contamination.

Foods commonly linked to SFP include processed foods, meat, poultry, dairy, and bakery products. Once the food is contaminated, staphylococci growth and enterotoxin production can occur, especially if good manufacturing conditions are not followed that prevent growth such as. 2007). Staphylococcus aureus is most commonly linked to staphylococcal food poisoning outbreaks, but other enterotoxigenic coagulase positive staphylococci such as S. hyicus and S. intermedius have also been implicated in outbreaks.

### Evidence for human adaptation and foodborne transmission of livestock-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus [^982e6bed]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Isolates from the epidemiologically linked urban cases were nearly identical to each other, suggesting either transmission between these persons or acquisition from a common source, for example, a contaminated food product. No attempts were made to identify possible food sources for the urban cases at the time of diagnosis, as S. aureus is not considered to cause foodborne disease, except from enterotoxin-produced gastroenteritis. Such investigations would also be difficult to perform under any circumstance because of the indefinite colonization period between exposure and disease.

The ΦSa3 phage encoding SCIN, CHIPS, and SAK was present in all 10 urban isolates and in several CC9/CC398 isolates from animals and food products. The phylogenetic distribution of the ΦSa3 phage suggests that it was reintroduced into CC9/CC398 in a single horizontal gene transfer event, after which it has been stably maintained as a prophage. SCIN, CHIPS, and SAK are antihost defense proteins that enable S. aureus to evade the human innate immune response and thus may contribute to colonization and virulence. This raises the possibility that ΦSa3-positive CC9/CC398 isolates are more likely to be disseminated both by the foodborne route and via human-to-human transmission chains than their ΦSa3-negative CC9/CC398 and CC398 relatives.

Taken together, these findings suggest that a subpopulation of CC9/CC398 has become adapted to humans and that poultry meat may serve as a vehicle for the transmission of such isolates. However, the cases described here are not sufficient to change the generally accepted view that foodborne transmission plays only a minor role in the epidemiology of LA-MRSA in humans. Nonetheless, we and others have shown that LA-MRSA strains are versatile organisms that have proven readily adaptable to a wide range of animal species, including humans, which clearly demonstrates that the future of S. aureus in livestock is unpredictable. Thus, from a public health perspective, it is essential to continue S. aureus surveillance at the human-animal interface to quickly detect evolutionary and epidemiologic changes and intervene to protect human health.

### How to diagnose a foodborne illness [^86b67f17]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Timely diagnosis of foodborne infection can be critical not only for the patient, but also for the larger community because of the potential to interrupt further spread. This article presents the diagnostic approach to patients with foodborne illness, discussing epidemiologic clues of various foodborne pathogens and their distinguishing clinical features of diagnostic importance. Also discussed are situations whereby stool cultures should be ordered; other helpful stool tests; nonculture methods of identifying organisms and their applicability in clinical settings; the role of pulsed-field gel electrophoresis in typing organisms; and large-scale sharing of data to aid in identification of large outbreaks.
