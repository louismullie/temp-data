## Question

What is the recommended dosage for: Treatment of vulvovaginal candidiasis in adults (female)?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the recommended dosage for treating vulvovaginal candidiasis in adult females. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about classifying disease as uncomplicated versus complicated. Then, I should verify first-line options and dosing for uncomplicated disease. Next, I will examine dosing for severe or recurrent disease, including induction and maintenance strategies. After that, I need to consider special populations such as pregnancy, HIV, and diabetes. Finally, I should review alternatives for azole-refractory or non-albicans cases and confirm safety, drug interactions, and follow-up recommendations.

> Let me first confirm the classification framework because treatment hinges on it. Uncomplicated VVC is typical disease in immunocompetent, nonpregnant women with mild to moderate symptoms, whereas complicated VVC includes severe inflammation, recurrent episodes, non-albicans species, or host factors like immunosuppression or poorly controlled diabetes, and this distinction drives both dose and duration of therapy [^de3787a0] [^e26e20c0].

> For uncomplicated VVC, I should confirm the first-line options and their equivalence. Both topical azoles and oral fluconazole are recommended, with no agent clearly superior, so patient preference and contraindications should guide choice. Oral fluconazole 150 mg as a single dose is a standard regimen with high response rates, and topical options include clotrimazole, miconazole, terconazole, butoconazole, and tioconazole in various single-dose or short-course regimens, all achieving roughly 80–90% symptom relief and mycologic cure when used correctly [^a1096638] [^8e825886] [^44f51a11] [^bc759a33].

> Wait, let me verify the comparative effectiveness of oral versus topical therapy. A Cochrane review suggests oral therapy probably improves short- and long-term mycologic cure versus intravaginal therapy, though clinical cure rates are similar, and patient preference often favors oral therapy for convenience. This supports offering fluconazole 150 mg orally once as a reasonable first choice when appropriate [^de625426].

> For severe VVC, I need to ensure I get the dosing right. Initially, I thought a single 150 mg fluconazole dose might suffice, but hold on, that underestimates severity. Guidelines recommend either 7–14 days of a topical azole or fluconazole 150 mg orally every 72 hours for a total of 2–3 doses, because severe inflammation reduces response to short-course therapy and sequential dosing improves clinical and mycologic outcomes [^a1096638] [^ef0ecdd2] [^40fed10e].

> For recurrent VVC, I should confirm the two-phase approach. Induction therapy of 10–14 days with a topical azole or oral fluconazole is followed by maintenance fluconazole 150 mg weekly for 6 months, which reduces recurrences substantially during treatment but often rebounds after cessation. This strategy is supported by randomized data and multiple guidelines, and I should counsel on the need for adherence and the likelihood of recurrence after stopping [^372ed96e] [^fcd6ddf6] [^4e4056ec].

> Let me consider special populations, starting with pregnancy. I should double-check the first-trimester risk signal. Oral fluconazole is not recommended in the first trimester due to associations with spontaneous abortion and possible congenital anomalies; topical azoles for 7 days are preferred throughout pregnancy, and if oral therapy is considered later, it should be used cautiously with shared decision-making given conflicting data and the absence of a clear safe window [^1ceac9e1] [^45ebb949] [^a95220fb].

> For women with HIV, I need to ensure treatment aligns with immunologic context. Uncomplicated VVC is treated the same as in women without HIV, but severe or recurrent disease warrants longer therapy, typically fluconazole 100–200 mg daily for at least 7 days or extended topical therapy. Suppressive therapy can be considered for frequent or severe recurrences, balancing benefits against the risk of azole resistance, and CD4-guided discontinuation may be reasonable once immune reconstitution occurs on ART [^e26e20c0] [^6c330ac4] [^ed3b1006].

> For diabetes and other immunocompromised states, I should confirm that shorter courses are less reliable. More prolonged therapy, often 7–14 days, is advised to overcome impaired host defenses, and optimizing glycemic control or correcting modifiable factors improves response and reduces recurrence risk [^e26e20c0].

> Now, non-albicans VVC deserves careful thought. I should verify that fluconazole may be ineffective for C. glabrata and some other species. In azole-refractory or non-albicans cases, options include topical boric acid 600 mg daily for 14 days, nystatin suppositories 100,000 units daily for 14 days, or topical flucytosine with or without amphotericin B for 14 days, with boric acid achieving about 70% clinical and mycologic cure in refractory C. glabrata disease [^84d6f45d] [^b4d96fe9] [^833a252d].

> Next, I should review newer agents and their roles. Ibrexafungerp 300 mg orally twice in one day is FDA-approved for acute VVC and offers a non-azole option with comparable efficacy to fluconazole in trials. For recurrent VVC, monthly ibrexafungerp after fluconazole induction reduced recurrences versus placebo in a phase 3 study, though contraception is required due to teratogenic risk. Oteseconazole is FDA-approved for recurrent VVC with regimens that include induction and weekly maintenance, but it is contraindicated in females of reproductive potential, so I need to ensure contraception and reproductive status are addressed before prescribing [^d93ab1b3] [^7d48bf9c] [^13e2787f] [^6c330ac4].

> I should confirm safety, interactions, and monitoring. Fluconazole is generally well tolerated but can cause GI upset, headache, and rare hepatotoxicity; a single 150 mg dose can meaningfully increase INR in patients on warfarin, so I need to check INR closely if coadministered. Ibrexafungerp commonly causes mild GI effects and requires effective contraception during treatment and for 4 days after the last dose. Routine labs are not required for single-dose fluconazole in healthy patients, but I should obtain liver function tests if symptoms persist or if using repeated dosing or interacting medications [^e1163ef1] [^d93ab1b3] [^13574ba2].

> Finally, I need to ensure follow-up and counseling are explicit. No routine follow-up is needed for uncomplicated VVC if symptoms resolve, but patients should return if symptoms persist beyond a few days, recur within 2 months, or worsen, prompting evaluation for alternative diagnoses, non-albicans species, or resistant organisms. I should also remind patients that topical agents are oil-based and may weaken latex condoms and diaphragms, and I should discourage empiric retreatment without confirmation of diagnosis when symptoms recur [^44f51a11] [^393573a9].

The recommended treatment for vulvovaginal candidiasis in adult females is **fluconazole 150 mg orally as a single dose** [^a1096638] for uncomplicated cases, with **topical azoles (clotrimazole, miconazole, terconazole, butoconazole, or tioconazole)** as equally effective alternatives [^de625426] [^8e825886]. For severe or recurrent disease, use **fluconazole 150 mg every 72 hours for 2–3 doses** [^a1096638] [^ef0ecdd2], followed by fluconazole 150 mg weekly for 6 months [^372ed96e] [^fcd6ddf6]. In pregnancy, use only topical azoles for 7 days [^1ceac9e1]; avoid oral fluconazole in the first trimester [^a95220fb] [^45ebb949]. For non-albicans or azole-resistant cases, consider boric acid 600 mg intravaginally for 14 days [^84d6f45d] [^833a252d] or ibrexafungerp 300 mg orally twice in one day [^d93ab1b3] [^186a0398].

## Uncomplicated vulvovaginal candidiasis

Uncomplicated VVC is defined as sporadic, infrequent episodes in immunocompetent women with mild to moderate symptoms and no risk factors for complications [^de3787a0]. First-line therapy is **fluconazole 150 mg orally as a single dose** [^a1096638] [^f48b43e3], which achieves clinical cure in > 90% of cases [^ef1658ff]. Alternatively, topical azoles are equally effective [^de625426] and may be preferred in patients who cannot take oral therapy or who prefer local treatment [^8e825886]:

- **Clotrimazole**: 1% cream 5 g intravaginally daily for 7–14 days, or 2% cream 5 g intravaginally daily for 3 days, or 500 mg suppository once [^44f51a11] [^bc759a33].
- **Miconazole**: 2% cream 5 g intravaginally daily for 7 days, or 4% cream 5 g intravaginally daily for 3 days, or 100 mg suppository daily for 7 days, or 200 mg suppository daily for 3 days, or 1,200 mg suppository once [^44f51a11] [^bc759a33].
- **Terconazole**: 0.4% cream 5 g intravaginally daily for 7 days, or 0.8% cream 5 g intravaginally daily for 3 days, or 80 mg suppository daily for 3 days [^44f51a11] [^f151b882].
- **Butoconazole**: 2% cream 5 g intravaginally once [^44f51a11] [^f151b882].
- **Tioconazole**: 6.5% ointment 5 g intravaginally once [^44f51a11] [^f151b882].

---

## Complicated vulvovaginal candidiasis

Complicated VVC includes severe disease, recurrent episodes (≥ 4 per year), non-albicans species, or immunocompromised hosts [^de3787a0]. Management requires **longer treatment duration** and, in recurrent cases, a maintenance regimen [^372ed96e].

---

### Severe vulvovaginal candidiasis

For severe VVC, characterized by extensive erythema, edema, excoriation, and fissures, **fluconazole 150 mg orally every 72 hours for 2–3 doses** is recommended [^a1096638] [^ef0ecdd2]. Alternatively, topical azoles can be used for 7–14 days [^ef0ecdd2] [^706540ec].

---

### Recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis

Recurrent VVC is defined as four or more symptomatic episodes within 12 months [^372ed96e]. Treatment consists of **two phases**:

- **Induction therapy**: Fluconazole 150 mg orally every 72 hours for 3 doses (days 1, 4, and 7) [^4e4056ec] or topical azoles for 10–14 days [^372ed96e].
- **Maintenance therapy**: Fluconazole 150 mg orally once weekly for 6 months [^372ed96e] [^fcd6ddf6].

---

## Special considerations

### Pregnancy

During pregnancy, **topical azoles are preferred** because oral fluconazole is associated with spontaneous abortion and congenital anomalies, especially in the first trimester [^1ceac9e1] [^45ebb949]. Recommended regimens include clotrimazole 1% cream 5 g intravaginally daily for 7 days or miconazole 2% cream 5 g intravaginally daily for 7 days [^1ceac9e1].

---

### Immunocompromised patients

In immunocompromised patients, including those with HIV infection, **longer treatment duration** (7–14 days) with topical or oral antifungals is recommended [^e26e20c0] [^6c330ac4]. Suppressive therapy with fluconazole 150 mg weekly may be considered for recurrent episodes [^c7587e9c].

---

### Non-albicans candidiasis

Non-albicans Candida species, particularly C. glabrata, may be less responsive to fluconazole. Alternative therapies include **boric acid 600 mg intravaginally daily for 14 days** [^84d6f45d] [^b4d96fe9] or ibrexafungerp 300 mg orally twice in one day [^d93ab1b3] [^186a0398].

## Summary of recommended regimens

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended regimen** |
|-|-|
| Uncomplicated VVC | Fluconazole 150 mg orally once or topical azoles for 1–14 days |
| Severe VVC | Fluconazole 150 mg orally every 72 hours for 2–3 doses or topical azoles for 7–14 days |
| Recurrent VVC | Induction: fluconazole 150 mg orally every 72 hours for 3 doses or topical azoles for 10–14 days; Maintenance: fluconazole 150 mg orally once weekly for 6 months |
| Pregnancy | Topical azoles for 7 days; avoid oral fluconazole in the first trimester |
| Non-albicans VVC | Boric acid 600 mg intravaginally daily for 14 days or ibrexafungerp 300 mg orally twice in one day |

---

The recommended treatment for vulvovaginal candidiasis in adult females is **fluconazole 150 mg orally as a single dose** for uncomplicated cases, with topical azoles as alternatives. For severe or recurrent disease, use fluconazole 150 mg every 72 hours for 2–3 doses, followed by weekly fluconazole for 6 months. In pregnancy, use topical azoles only and avoid oral fluconazole in the first trimester.

Recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis — definition and suppressive therapy: Recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis, defined as ≥ 4 episodes of symptomatic infection within one year, should begin with induction therapy with a topical agent or oral fluconazole for 10–14 days, followed by maintenance azole; for recurring vulvovaginal candidiasis, 10–14 days of induction therapy with a topical agent or oral fluconazole, followed by fluconazole, 150 mg weekly for 6 months, is recommended (strong recommendation; high-quality evidence). The most convenient and well-tolerated regimen is 150 mg fluconazole weekly, achieving control of symptoms in > 90% of patients, but after cessation a 40%–50% recurrence rate can be anticipated; if fluconazole therapy is not feasible, topical clotrimazole cream, 200 mg twice weekly, clotrimazole vaginal suppository 500 mg once weekly, or other intermittent oral or topical antifungal treatment is recommended.

### A randomized phase 2 study of VT-1161 for the treatment of acute vulvovaginal candidiasis [^df161ef6]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) is common among women, but current azole antifungal treatments are often associated with safety and resistance issues. VT-1161 (oteseconazole) is an oral agent with increased selectivity for fungal CYP51. In this phase 2 clinical study, we evaluated the efficacy and safety of VT-1161 vs fluconazole in participants with moderate to severe acute VVC.

Methods

Participants presenting with an acute episode of VVC (n = 55) were randomized to receive VT-1161 300 mg once daily (q.d.) for 3 days, 600 mg q.d. for 3 days, or 600 mg twice daily (b.i.d.) for 3 days or to receive a single dose of fluconazole 150 mg (FDA-approved dose to treat acute VVC). Participants were followed for 6 months. The primary outcome was the proportion of participants with therapeutic (clinical and mycological) cure at day 28.

Results

A larger proportion of participants in the per-protocol population experienced therapeutic cure in the VT-1161 300 mg q.d. (75.0%), VT-1161 600 mg q.d. (85.7%), and VT-1161 600 mg b.i.d. (78.6%) groups vs the fluconazole group (62.5%); differences were not statistically significant. At 3 and 6 months, no participants in the VT-1161 groups vs 28.5% and 46.1% in the fluconazole group, respectively, had evidence of mycological recurrence. No serious adverse events or treatment-emergent adverse events leading to discontinuation were reported.

Conclusions

The majority of participants across all treatment groups achieved therapeutic cure at day 28. VT-1161 was well tolerated at all dose levels through 6 months of follow-up.

### Treatment of uncomplicated vulvovaginal candidiasis: topical or oral drugs? Single-day or multiple-day therapy? A network meta-analysis of randomized trials [^615ad432]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

To assess early (7–10 days) and late (24–35 days) clinical and mycological cure rates associated with single or multiple-day topical or oral treatment of uncomplicated vulvovaginal candidiasis.

Data Sources

Cochrane Central Register of Studies Online (inception to 31 March 2024), MEDLINE, Ovid platform (1946–31 March 2024), Embase, (inception to 31 March 2024), Google Scholar (inception to 31 March 2024), US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register ClinicalTrials.gov, World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and European Clinical Trials Register.

Study Eligibility Criteria

Fifty (N = 7208 subjects) randomized studies comparing different topical or oral drugs with or without placebo were included in the analysis. Confidence in the results of network meta-analysis was evaluated by using an online tool that combines confidence assessments arising from direct comparisons with network meta-analysis estimates. The risk of bias of individual studies was assessed using the Revised Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomized trials.

Study Appraisal and Synthesis Methods

Bayesian network meta-analysis was performed using an interactive web-based tool with the R packages gemct and BUGSNET. Ranking success probabilities were computed on the basis of the surface under the cumulative ranking curve.

Results

Compared with placebo, all the treatments studied were highly efficacious (> 75%) for the clinical and mycological cure of vulvovaginal candidiasis. Single-day use of 150 mg of fluconazole was slightly more effective than multiple-day topical therapy in early clinical cure both in pairwise (pooled odds ratio = 1.9, 95% confidence interval = 1.31–2.74, I2 = 0%) and network meta-analysis (odds ratio = 1.52, 95% confidence interval = 1.13–2.07) analyses. In the evaluation of late clinical cure, there were no significant differences in the odds ratios of success between oral and topical treatment, either as single or multiple-day therapy (3983 subjects in the network). Single dose fluconazole was marginally superior to multiple-day topical treatment in late mycological cure (odds ratio = 1.42, 95% confidence interval = 1–1.99). In the ranking analysis, single-day oral fluconazole treatment had the best chance of achieving early (surface under the cumulative ranking curve = 74.1%) and late (surface under the cumulative ranking curve = 84.2%) mycological cure. Multiple-day treatment with itraconazole scored best in early (surface under the cumulative ranking curve = 99%) and late (surface under the cumulative ranking curve = 75.7%) relief of symptoms.

Conclusion

Given the high efficacy of both oral and topical drugs, a strict hierarchy of competing treatments for uncomplicated vulvovaginal candidiasis is probably inappropriate; however, current guidelines should acknowledge that oral azoles have a higher chance of clinical success and microbiological eradication of Candida than topical drugs.

### Maintenance fluconazole therapy for recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis [^fcd6ddf6]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2004). Excellent credibility.

Background

No safe and convenient regimen has proved to be effective for the management of recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis.

Methods

After inducing clinical remission with open-label fluconazole given in three 150-mg doses at 72-hour intervals, we randomly assigned 387 women with recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis to receive treatment with fluconazole (150 mg) or placebo weekly for six months, followed by six months of observation without therapy. The primary outcome measure was the proportion of women in clinical remission at the end of the first six-month period. Secondary efficacy measures were the clinical outcome at 12 months, vaginal mycologic status, and time to recurrence on the basis of Kaplan-Meier analysis.

Results

Weekly treatment with fluconazole was effective in preventing symptomatic vulvovaginal candidiasis. The proportions of women who remained disease-free at 6, 9, and 12 months in the fluconazole group were 90.8 percent, 73.2 percent, and 42.9 percent, as compared with 35.9 percent, 27.8 percent, and 21.9 percent, respectively, in the placebo group (P < 0.001). The median time to clinical recurrence in the fluconazole group was 10.2 months, as compared with 4.0 months in the placebo group (P < 0.001). There was no evidence of fluconazole resistance in isolates of Candida albicans or of superinfection with C. glabrata. Fluconazole was discontinued in one patient because of headache.

Conclusions

Long-term weekly treatment with fluconazole can reduce the rate of recurrence of symptomatic vulvovaginal candidiasis. However, a long-term cure remains difficult to achieve.

### Phase 2 randomized study of oral ibrexafungerp versus fluconazole in vulvovaginal candidiasis [^f5908ef0]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

This dose-finding study is limited as no formal sample size calculation was performed and therefore, the study was not statistically powered. All analyses were descriptive in nature only. Also, sample sizes for the treatment groups were small. One strength of the study was use of an active comparator to ibrexafungerp, fluconazole, instead of a placebo. Although patients in this study received only 1 dose, we recognize that current practice guidelines recommend patients receive 2–3 doses of fluconazole for patients with severe Candida vulvovaginitis, which would have most likely affected the outcomes of the fluconazole arm in our study. Single dose fluconazole was used to provide an active FDA-approved comparator to ibrexafungerp.

In conclusion, ibrexafungerp provides a safe, new, and novel treatment for moderate-to-severe acute VVC. Establishing the clinical role for single day ibrexafungerp treatment in women with acute VVC will be forthcoming following analysis of the 2 large phase 3 studies, VANISH-303 (NCT03734991) and VANISH-306 (NCT03987620), in which the potential advantages of ibrexafungerp against azole resistant isolates and different Candida species can be evaluated.

RESULTS

Participant Demographics and Disposition

Between October 2013 and September 2014, 55 female participants were randomized into the study (Figure 1). Participants were followed for approximately 6 months including up to 3 days for screening, 3 days for study drug administration, and a final follow-up visit 6 months after starting treatment.

The study had a high rate of completion across all groups: VT-1161 300 mg q.d. 12/14, 85.7%; VT-1161 600 mg q.d. 10/12, 83.3%; VT-1161 600 mg b.i.d. 13/14, 92.9%; and fluconazole 150 mg single dose, 13/15, 86.7%. No participant withdrew from the study due to an AE. All protocol deviations were considered to be minor and did not affect study outcomes.

Baseline participant demographics are summarized in Table 1. Overall, the average age of participants was 32.7 years. Baseline characteristics were similar across the groups.

Efficacy

The primary efficacy outcome was the proportion of participants with therapeutic cure at the day 28 TOC visit. These data are summarized for all populations (PP, mITT, and ITT) in Table 2. A larger proportion of participants in the PP population experienced therapeutic cure in the VT-1161 300 mg q.d. (6/8, 75.0%), VT-1161 600 mg q.d. (6/7, 85.7%), and VT-1161 600 mg b.i.d. (11/14, 78.6%) treatment groups vs the fluconazole 150 mg group (5/8, 62.5%). No statistically significant difference was observed for any of the VT-1161 treatment groups vs the fluconazole group. The secondary efficacy outcome measures included the proportion of participants with clinical cure, mycological cure, clinical improvement, clinical relapse, and mycological relapse. These data are summarized for the PP population in Table 3.

Abstract

Background

Acute vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) is common among women, but current azole antifungal treatments are often associated with safety and resistance issues. VT-1161 (oteseconazole) is an oral agent with increased selectivity for fungal CYP51. In this phase 2 clinical study, we evaluated the efficacy and safety of VT-1161 vs fluconazole in participants with moderate to severe acute VVC.

Methods

Participants presenting with an acute episode of VVC (n = 55) were randomized to receive VT-1161 300 mg once daily (q.d.) for 3 days, 600 mg q.d. for 3 days, or 600 mg twice daily (b.i.d.) for 3 days or to receive a single dose of fluconazole 150 mg (FDA-approved dose to treat acute VVC). Participants were followed for 6 months. The primary outcome was the proportion of participants with therapeutic (clinical and mycological) cure at day 28.

Results

A larger proportion of participants in the per-protocol population experienced therapeutic cure in the VT-1161 300 mg q.d. (75.0%), VT-1161 600 mg q.d. (85.7%), and VT-1161 600 mg b.i.d. (78.6%) groups vs the fluconazole group (62.5%); differences were not statistically significant. At 3 and 6 months, no participants in the VT-1161 groups vs 28.5% and 46.1% in the fluconazole group, respectively, had evidence of mycological recurrence. No serious adverse events or treatment-emergent adverse events leading to discontinuation were reported.

Conclusions

The majority of participants across all treatment groups achieved therapeutic cure at day 28. VT-1161 was well tolerated at all dose levels through 6 months of follow-up.

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of candidiasis: 2016 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^de3787a0]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

Vulvovaginal candidiasis — uncomplicated vs complicated management: Vulvovaginal candidiasis can be classified as uncomplicated, which is present in about 90% of cases, or complicated, about 10% of cases. Uncomplicated infection can be effectively treated with either single-dose fluconazole or short-course fluconazole for 3 days, both of which achieve > 90% response. Complicated vulvovaginal candidiasis requires therapy administered intravaginally with topical agents for 5–7 days or orally with fluconazole 150 mg every 72 hours for 3 doses. Most Candida species, with the exception of C. krusei and C. glabrata, respond to oral fluconazole, and Candida krusei responds to all topical antifungal agents; treatment of C. glabrata vulvovaginal candidiasis is problematic and azole therapy, including voriconazole, is frequently unsuccessful.

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^4e4056ec]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). High credibility.

Recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) treatment — most episodes caused by C. albicans respond to short-duration azoles, but to maintain control a longer initial course is recommended: 7–14 days of topical therapy or a 100-mg, 150-mg, or 200-mg oral dose of fluconazole every third day for a total of 3 doses (days 1, 4, and 7); the indicated maintenance regimen is oral fluconazole (a 100-mg, 150-mg, or 200-mg dose) weekly for 6 months, with intermittent topical treatments considered if not feasible; suppressive maintenance therapies are effective at controlling recurrent VVC but are rarely curative long-term, and susceptibility tests should be obtained for symptomatic patients who remain culture positive despite maintenance therapy with management in consultation with a specialist.

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of candidiasis: 2016 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^84d6f45d]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

IDSA 2016 candidiasis guideline — vulvovaginal candidiasis management details dosing and alternatives for uncomplicated, severe, Candida glabrata, and recurrent disease. For uncomplicated Candida vulvovaginitis, a single 150-mg oral dose of fluconazole is recommended (strong recommendation; high-quality evidence). For severe acute Candida vulvovaginitis, fluconazole, 150 mg, given every 72 hours for a total of 2 or 3 doses, is recommended (strong recommendation; high-quality evidence). For C. glabrata vulvovaginitis unresponsive to oral azoles, topical intravaginal boric acid, 600 mg daily, for 14 days is an alternative (strong recommendation; low-quality evidence), nystatin intravaginal suppositories, 100 000 units daily for 14 days (strong recommendation; low-quality evidence), or topical 17% flucytosine cream alone or with 3% AmB cream administered daily for 14 days (weak recommendation; low-quality evidence). For recurring vulvovaginal candidiasis, 10–14 days of induction therapy with a topical agent or oral fluconazole, followed by fluconazole, 150 mg weekly for 6 months, is recommended (strong recommendation; high-quality evidence).

### Phase 2 randomized study of oral ibrexafungerp versus fluconazole in vulvovaginal candidiasis [^fa0e1061]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Vulvovaginal candidiasis affects approximately 75% of women in their lifetime. Approved treatment options are limited to oral or topical azoles. Ibrexafungerp, a novel, first-in-class oral triterpenoid glucan synthase inhibitor, has demonstrated broad fungicidal Candida activity and a favorable tolerability profile. The primary objective of this dose-finding study was to identify the optimal dose of oral ibrexafungerp in patients with acute vulvovaginal candidiasis.

Methods

Patients with vulvovaginal signs and symptoms score ≥ 7 were randomized equally to 6 treatments groups: 5 treatment doses of oral ibrexafungerp or oral fluconazole 150 mg. The primary endpoint was the percentage of patients with a clinical cure (complete resolution of vulvovaginal signs and symptoms) at the test-of-cure visit (day 10).

Results

Overall, 186 patients were randomized into the 6 treatment groups. Results, using the modified intent-to-treat population (baseline positive culture), are reported for ibrexafungerp 300 mg twice daily (BID) for 1 day (n = 27), which was the dose selected for phase 3 studies, and fluconazole 150 mg for 1 day (n = 24). At day 10, the clinical cure rates for ibrexafungerp and fluconazole were 51.9% and 58.3%, respectively; at day 25, patients with no signs or symptoms were 70.4% and 50.0%, respectively. During the study ibrexafungerp patients required less antifungal rescue medications compared with fluconazole (3.7% vs 29.2%, respectively). Ibrexafungerp was well tolerated, with the most common treatment-related adverse events being mild gastrointestinal events.

Conclusions

Ibrexafungerp is a well-tolerated novel antifungal with comparable efficacy to fluconazole in the treatment of acute vulvovaginal candidiasis.

### A phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of orally administered VT-1161 in the treatment of recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis [^91112af4]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Lanosterol demethylase is an enzyme that is essential for fungal growth and catalyzes an early step in the biosynthetic pathway of ergosterol, which is a sterol that is required for fungal cell membrane formation and integrity. Lanosterol demethylase is the molecular target of the class of drugs referred to as "azole antifungals". VT-1161 is a novel, oral, selective inhibitor of fungal lanosterol demethylase and is being developed for the treatment of recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis.

Objective

We evaluated the efficacy and safety of 4 dosing regimens of oral VT-1161 compared with placebo in women with recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis, which was defined as at least 3 symptomatic episodes of acute vulvovaginal candidiasis within a 12-month period.

Study Design

Two hundred fifteen women with a documented history of recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis and who, at screening, were experiencing an episode of acute vulvovaginal candidiasis (acute vulvovaginal candidiasis; composite vulvovaginal signs and symptoms score of ≥ 3 and a positive potassium hydroxide test for yeast) were enrolled. After treatment of the acute infection with fluconazole, subjects were assigned randomly to 1 of 5 treatment regimens: (1) VT-1161 150 mg once daily for 7 days, then 150 mg once weekly for 11 weeks, followed by a once-weekly dose of placebo for 12 weeks; (2) VT-1161 300 mg once daily for 7 days, then 300 mg once weekly for 11 weeks, followed by a once-weekly dose of placebo for 12 weeks; (3) VT-1161 150 mg once daily for 7 days, then 150 mg once weekly for 23 weeks; (4) VT-1161 300 mg once daily for 7 days, then 300 mg once weekly for 23 weeks; or (5) a matching placebo regimen for 24 weeks. The primary efficacy outcome was the proportion of subjects with ≥ 1 culture-verified acute vulvovaginal candidiasis episodes through week 48.

Results

In the intent-to-treat population, the proportion of subjects with ≥ 1 acute vulvovaginal candidiasis episodes ranged from 0–7% across the 4 VT-1161 arms vs 52% in the placebo arm, with all arms achieving statistical significance vs placebo. VT-1161 was well-tolerated with a favorable safety profile, and the incidence of adverse events was lower in all VT-1161 arms compared with placebo. In addition, no patient in any VT-1161 arm discontinued the study early because of an adverse event or laboratory abnormality. There was also no evidence of an adverse effect of VT-1161 on liver function or electrocardiogram recordings.

Conclusion

In this study, VT-1161 was shown to be efficacious and safe in the treatment of patients with recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis. These data strongly support further clinical investigation of VT-1161 for the treatment of recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis.

### Phase 2 randomized study of oral ibrexafungerp versus fluconazole in vulvovaginal candidiasis [^4d2c8e76]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

Based on patient convenience and efficacy and safety data in this study, ibrexafungerp 300 mg BID for 1 day was the dosage selected for further evaluation in phase 3 studies. Our study suggested comparable clinical cure rates between ibrexafungerp 300 mg BID for 1 day and fluconazole at TOC. In this phase 2 study, we found it encouraging that certain parameters, such as improved and sustained VSS scores, mycological eradication at day 25, and the need for rescue medication appeared to be improved with ibrexafungerp compared with fluconazole. Because our study was not statistically powered, these initial findings will need further study to see if the observed differences are meaningful.

In 2019, the FDA provided pharmaceutical industry guidance for drug development in the treatment of VVC and recommended clinical cure, defined as the complete absence of all VSS, as the primary efficacy endpoint. In our study, a clinical cure was defined as the complete resolution of VSS (VSS score = 0) by the TOC visit without the need for further antifungal treatment. Mycological eradication was not a primary endpoint, as Candida is normally found in the vagina. Given variations in efficacy outcome definitions in previous studies of VVC, historical comparisons are difficult. However, some previous studies have reported a decreased sustained response with azole treatment from day 14 to day 35. In comparison, the percentage of patients receiving ibrexafungerp with no VSS increased from 51.9% at TOC to 70.4% at day 25 in our study suggesting continued improvement and sustained efficacy.

### Phase 2 randomized study of oral ibrexafungerp versus fluconazole in vulvovaginal candidiasis [^b5b8df13]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Outcomes

The primary objective was to identify an optimal dose of oral ibrexafungerp in patients with moderate-to-severe acute VVC. The primary efficacy endpoint was the percentage of patients with a clinical cure (complete resolution of signs and symptoms; VSS = 0) at TOC; clinical failure was defined as no response to therapy or incomplete resolution of VSS or need for additional vulvovaginal or systemic antifungal therapy before the TOC visit. Secondary objectives were to evaluate the efficacy of oral ibrexafungerp in patients with VVC based on mycological and clinical outcomes and to evaluate the safety and tolerability of ibrexafungerp. Secondary efficacy endpoints were the percentage of patients with mycological eradication (negative fungal culture) at TOC and day 25, percentage of patients with both clinical cure and mycological eradication at TOC, percentage of patients with both absence of VSS and mycological eradication at day 25, and percentage of patients with continued clinical response (ongoing absence of symptoms in patients achieving clinical cure at TOC) at day 25. Exploratory endpoints included percentage of patients at day 25 who were symptom-free (absence of symptoms regardless of clinical outcome at TOC; patients that received additional antifungal therapy were considered not being free of VSS at day 25). Post hoc analyses included VSS score ≤ 1 (clinical improvement) at TOC and day 25 and the use of antifungal rescue medications.

Statistical Analysis

As a dose-finding study with no formal sample size calculation performed, this study was not statistically powered. All analyses are descriptive in nature. Approximately 180 patients were planned to be enrolled and equally randomized to the 6 study treatment groups. Thirty patients per group was estimated to be adequate for an initial assessment of safety and potential efficacy. The intent-to-treat (ITT) population included all randomized patients. The modified ITT (mITT) population included all randomized patients who had a positive KOH test and a confirmed positive mycological culture for yeast at baseline; all efficacy results will be reported using the mITT population. The safety population included all randomized patients who received ≥ 1 dose of study drug and had ≥ 1 postbaseline evaluation.

Vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) — sex partner management and special populations: For complicated VVC, no recommendation can be made for treating sex partners because no data exist to support this practice. In compromised hosts, efforts to correct modifiable conditions should be made and more prolonged (i.e., 7–14 days) conventional treatment is necessary. During pregnancy, only topical azole therapies, applied for 7 days, are recommended for use among pregnant women, and a single 150-mg dose of fluconazole might be associated with spontaneous abortion and congenital anomalies; therefore, it should not be used. In HIV infection, treatment for uncomplicated and complicated VVC among women with HIV infection should not differ from that for women who do not have HIV; although long-term prophylactic therapy with fluconazole 200 mg weekly has been effective in reducing C. albicans colonization and symptomatic VVC, this regimen is not recommended for women with HIV infection in the absence of complicated VVC, and the effect of treatment for VVC on HIV acquisition and transmission remains unknown.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Dosage and Administration in Adults:

Single Dose

Vaginal candidiasis: The recommended dosage of fluconazole for vaginal candidiasis is 150 mg as a single oral dose.

Multiple Dose

SINCE ORAL ABSORPTION IS RAPID AND ALMOST COMPLETE, THE DAILY DOSE OF FLUCONAZOLE IS THE SAME FOR ORAL AND INTRAVENOUS ADMINISTRATION. In general, a loading dose of twice the daily dose is recommended on the first day of therapy to result in plasma concentrations close to steady-state by the second day of therapy.

The daily dose of fluconazole for the treatment of infections other than vaginal candidiasis should be based on the infecting organism and the patient's response to therapy. Treatment should be continued until clinical parameters or laboratory tests indicate that active fungal infection has subsided. An inadequate period of treatment may lead to recurrence of active infection. Patients with AIDS and cryptococcal meningitis or recurrent oropharyngeal candidiasis usually require maintenance therapy to prevent relapse.

Oropharyngeal candidiasis: The recommended dosage of fluconazole for oropharyngeal candidiasis is 200 mg on the first day, followed by 100 mg once daily. Clinical evidence of oropharyngeal candidiasis generally resolves within several days, but treatment should be continued for at least 2 weeks to decrease the likelihood of relapse.

Esophageal candidiasis: The recommended dosage of fluconazole for esophageal candidiasis is 200 mg on the first day, followed by 100 mg once daily. Doses up to 400 mg/day may be used, based on medical judgment of the patient's response to therapy. Patients with esophageal candidiasis should be treated for a minimum of three weeks and for at least two weeks following resolution of symptoms.

### A phase 3, multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of monthly oral ibrexafungerp to reduce the incidence of recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis [^7d48bf9c]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis develops in 5–9% of people assigned female at birth and has a serious impact on quality of life. Oral ibrexafungerp is a first-in-class, non-azole, triterpenoid antifungal approved in the United States for the treatment of postmenarchal females with acute vulvovaginal candidiasis and for the reduction in the incidence of recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis.

Objective

(S): This Phase 3 study (CANDLE) describes the efficacy and safety of monthly oral ibrexafungerp vs placebo for reducing the incidence of recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis.

Study Design

Participants with a history of recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis experiencing an acute infection episode (confirmed by positive potassium hydroxide test) received 3 doses of oral fluconazole (150 mg once-daily every 3 days). Those who had a culture-confirmed vulvovaginal candidiasis from the screening sample, achieved significant resolution of signs and symptoms (composite Vulvovaginal Signs and Symptoms score ≤ 2) following fluconazole treatment, and continued to meet all study eligibility criteria entered a maintenance phase. In the maintenance phase, eligible participants were randomized (1:1) to oral ibrexafungerp (300 mg twice-daily for one day) or placebo, which was repeated once every 4 weeks for a total of 6 treatments (until Week 20). Efficacy was assessed by the percentage of participants with no mycologically-proven recurrence and the percentage of participants with clinical success (a participant with a Test-of-Cure [Week 24] evaluation and no recurrence; mycologically-proven, presumed, or suspected) by Test-of-Cure (4 weeks after last study drug dose). Safety and tolerability assessments included incidence of adverse events and treatment discontinuations. Participants were further assessed for recurrence during a 12-week follow-up phase.

Results

In the intent-to-treat population, 70.8% (n = 92/130) of participants who received ibrexafungerp and 58.5% (n = 76/130) who received placebo had no mycologically-proven recurrence by Test-of-Cure (relative risk: 1.22; 95% confidence interval: 1.032, 1.430; P = 0.019). The proportion of participants who achieved clinical success by Test-of-Cure was 65.4% (n = 85/130) with ibrexafungerp and 53.1% (n = 69/130) with placebo (relative risk: 1.24; 95% confidence interval: 1.034, 1.486; P = 0.020). The benefit of ibrexafungerp over placebo was sustained over the 4 months following last study drug dose for both the no mycologically-proven recurrence (65.4% [n = 85/130] vs 53.8% [n = 70/130]; relative risk: 1.22; 95% confidence interval: 1.021, 1.456; P = 0.029) and clinical success (57.7% [n = 75/130] vs 46.2% [n = 60/130]; relative risk: 1.26; 95% confidence interval: 1.017, 1.555; P = 0.034) endpoints. Overall, 64.6% (n = 84/130) of participants who received ibrexafungerp and 58.5% (n = 76/130) of participants who received placebo experienced ≥ 1 treatment-emergent adverse event. Treatment-related adverse events occurred in 14.6% (n = 19/130) of participants in the ibrexafungerp group and 6.9% (n = 9/130) of participants in the placebo group. No adverse events in the ibrexafungerp group led to treatment or study discontinuation. The most common adverse events reported in both the ibrexafungerp and placebo groups were headache, bacterial vaginosis, and diarrhea; these events were mostly mild in severity.

Conclusion

Once-monthly oral ibrexafungerp was effective and well-tolerated in participants with recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis.

### Interventions for prevention and treatment of vulvovaginal candidiasis in women with HIV infection [^e9af6bd9]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) is one of the most common fungal infections that recur frequently in HIV infected women. Symptoms of VVC are pruritis, discomfort, dyspareunia, and dysuria. Vulval infection presents as a morbiliform rash that may extend to the thighs. Vaginal infection is associated with white discharge, and plaques are seen on erythematous vaginal walls. Even though rarely or never resulting in systemic fungal infection or mortality, left untreated these lesions contribute considerably to the morbidity associated with HIV infection. Prevention and treatment of this condition is an essential part of maintaining the quality of life for these individuals.

Objectives

-To compare the efficacy of various antifungals given vaginally or orally for the treatment and prophylaxis of VVC in HIV-infected women and to evaluate the risks of the same.

Search Strategy

The search strategy was comprehensive, iterative and based on that of the HIV/AIDS Cochrane Review Group. The aim was to locate all relevant trials, irrespective of publication status or language. Electronic databases :CENTRAL, Medline, EMBASE, LILACS and CINAHL were searched for randomised controlled trials for the years 1980 to 1st October 2010. WHO ICTRP site and other relevant web sites were also searched for conference abstracts.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of palliative, preventative or curative therapy were considered. Participants were HIV positive women receiving one or more of the following:treatment / prophylaxis for VVC or HAART(Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy).

Data Collection and Analysis

Three authors independently assessed the methodological quality of the trials and extracted data. The quality of the evidence generated was graded using the GRADE PRO approach.

Main Results

Our search did not yield any trial investigating treatment of VVC in HIV positive women. Two trials dealing with prophylaxis were eligible for inclusion. One trial (n = 323) favoured the use of weekly Fluconazole as compared to placebo (RR 0.68; 95% CI 0.47 to 0.97). The second trial with three arms of comparison; Clotrimazole, Lactobacillus and Placebo gave no definitive results in preventing an episode of VVC. Clotrimazole against placebo (RR 0.49; 95% CI 0.22 to 1.09), Clotrimazole against lactobacillus (RR 1.11; 95% CI 0.45 to 2.76) and lactobacillus against placebo (RR 0.54 ;95% CI 0.26 to 1.13).

Authors' Conclusions

Implications for practiceNo trials were found addressing treatment of VVC in HIV positive women. In comparison to placebo, Fluconazole was found to be an effective preventative intervention. However, the potential for resistant Candida organisms to develop might impact the feasibility of implementation. Direction of findings suggests that Clotrimazole and Lactobacillus improved the prophylactic outcomes when compared to placebo. Implications for research There is a need to evaluate drugs and drug regimens for VVC treatment and prophylaxis in HIV positive women through randomised clinical trials. Development of resistance to azoles remains under-studied and more work must be done in this area, so as to determine whether routine prophylaxis for VVC is at all needed or whether adequate ART would be sufficient to prevent recurrent VVC. The viral load in vaginal secretions with or without treatment or prophylaxis has not been studied, this is very relevant to the spread of HIV.

### A randomized phase 2 study of VT-1161 for the treatment of acute vulvovaginal candidiasis [^4f90927e]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

An interactive web response system was used to initially randomize participants in a 3:3:2 ratio to 300 mg q.d. or 600 mg q.d. VT-1161 or fluconazole. Participants were stratified by composite vulvovaginal signs and symptoms severity score (6–8 and ≥ 9) at screening and monitored to ensure that ≥ 50% of the participants had a VVC severity score of ≥ 9.

An interim safety analysis was performed after all participants randomized to receive VT-1161 300 mg q.d. and 600 mg q.d. (first randomization) had completed their test-of-cure (TOC) visit on day 28. Demographics and baseline characteristics, adverse events (AEs), laboratory assessments, electrocardiograms (ECGs), and efficacy. PK data were summarized and reviewed by the independent medical monitor. Based on this analysis, the VT-1161 600 mg b.i.d. group was added. After the interim analysis, participants were randomized in a 3:1 ratio to 600 mg b.i.d. VT-1161 or fluconazole. A second interim analysis was performed to review safety, efficacy, and PK when the last participant of the VT-1161 600 mg b.i.d. group completed their TOC visit. The duration of individual participant participation was approximately 6 months.

Participants returned to the clinic on days 7, 14, 28, 84 (3 months), and 168 (6 months) for efficacy, safety, laboratory, and PK assessments. TOC was assessed on day 28.

The trial was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and the Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice. The study protocol was reviewed and approved by the appropriate institutional review board. All participants gave written informed consent before participating in the study.

### A clinician's guide to the diagnosis and treatment of candidiasis in patients with psoriasis [^1020ad7a]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Vulvovaginal Candidiasis

It is estimated that 75% of all women experience at least one VVC infection during their childbearing years. Symptoms of VVC can include vulvar pruritus and burning, and soreness and irritation can lead to dyspareunia and dysuria. Concurrent fungal infections can worsen psoriasis; therefore, it is important for VVC to be identified and treated quickly in this population.

VVC is often diagnosed based on clinical history and physical examination showing signs of vulvar and vaginal erythema, edema, excoriation, fissures, and/or thick, curd-like vaginal discharge (Fig. 1 c). IDSA guidelines recommend confirming diagnosis with a wet-mount preparation in saline and 10% KOH, and a check of vaginal pH, which should be normal (< 4.5), before beginning antifungal treatment. Cultures should be obtained for patients with negative wet-mount findings.

Most (approximately 90%) cases of VVC are uncomplicated, and IDSA guidelines recommend treatment with topical antifungal agents (Table 2) or a single 150 mg dose of oral fluconazole (strength of recommendation: A). A number of topical antifungal agents are effective treatments for uncomplicated VVC, with no agent showing clear superiority. Response rates are generally high (> 90%) and comparable with topical versus oral therapies, whether given as a short course or as single-dose therapy. Because there are many available therapies that are safe and effective for uncomplicated VVC, patient preference (e.g. for oral vs. topical therapy) should be considered when making treatment decisions.

Table 2
Intravaginal treatments for vulvovaginal candidiasis

a Available with and without miconazole 2% external cream for use twice daily for 7 days

Complicated VVC is defined as severe or recurrent disease, infection due to a Candida species other than C. albicans, and/or VVC in an abnormal host. Such infections require treatment with topical therapy administered intravaginally daily for approximately 7 days, or multiple oral doses of fluconazole (150 mg every 72 h for three doses). For recurrent VVC, defined as four or more symptomatic episodes within a 1-year period, IDSA guidelines recommend 10–14 days of induction therapy with a topical or oral triazole, followed by fluconazole 150 mg once weekly for 6 months (strength of recommendation: A).

### Treatment of candidiasis… [^a0d44dd0]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Candidiasis is treated with antifungal medication.
- **Antifungal medications come in different forms**: creams, oral gels, pills, or intravenous.
- The type of antifungal, dose, and length of treatment depend on the type and severity of infection and the patient's overall health.
- Take antifungal medications as instructed for as long as directed. Treatment Vaginal candidiasis Treatment is usually an antifungal cream applied inside the vagina or a single dose of fluconazole taken by mouth. Creams can be sold over the counter, but testing is recommended before starting a treatment. If symptoms return, don't improve, or get worse after starting treatment, healthcare providers may adjust the treatment by prescribing:

- More doses of fluconazole taken by mouth.
- Other medicines applied inside the vagina, such as boric acid, nystatin, or flucytosine.

Candidiasis of the mouth and throat Mild to moderate infections: Treatment for most infections include an antifungal oral gel applied inside the mouth for 7–14 days. Types of antifungals used include clotrimazole, miconazole, or nystatin. Severe infections: Antifungal medication in pill form or through an IV. The most common type of antifungal used is fluconazole. Candidiasis of the esophagus The antifungal medication fluconazole is almost always used to treat candidiasis of the esophagus. It can be taken as a pill or, for severe infections, through an IV. Other antifungal medications may be used if fluconazole is not working. The initial recommended antifungal treatment for most adults is an echinocandin given through the vein. Fluconazole, amphotericin B, and other antifungal medications may also be appropriate in certain situations.

For Health Care ProvidersClinical Overview of Invasive Candidiasis. Length of treatment For bloodstream Candida infections, treatment should continue for 2 weeks after signs and symptoms have resolved and Candida yeasts are no longer in the bloodstream. Other forms of invasive candidiasis, such as infections in the bones, joints, heart, or central nervous system, usually need to be treated for a longer period of time.

### Phase 2 randomized study of oral ibrexafungerp versus fluconazole in vulvovaginal candidiasis [^62c25c25]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC), more commonly known as vaginal yeast infections, is one of the most common causes of vaginitis. In 80%–95% of women, VVC is caused by Candida albicans with fewer remaining infections caused by non- albicans Candida species including Candida glabrata, Candida parapsilosis, Candida tropicalis, Candida krusei, or other fungi. Approximately 75% of women will have ≥ 1 episode of VVC in their lifetime, and 40%–45% of women will experience ≥ 2 episodes. By the age of 25 years, an estimated 50% of all women will have experienced ≥ 1 episode of VVC after the onset of sexual activity. Current treatment options for VVC are predominantly limited to the azole class of fungistatic agents and include short courses of topical formulations of various agents or oral fluconazole given as a 150-mg single or multiple dose regimen. Limitations of available treatments include concerns of intolerance, adverse events (AEs), and with fluconazole, a potential risk of miscarriage and fetal harm. More recent VVC treatment limitations include an increasing prevalence of fluconazole resistance and intrinsic resistance or low susceptibility of non- albicans Candida species to azole antifungals.

Treatment

Most episodes of recurrent VVC caused by C. albicans respond well to short-duration oral or topical azole therapy. However, to maintain clinical and mycologic control, a longer duration of initial therapy (e.g. 7–14 days of topical therapy or a 100-mg, 150-mg, or 200-mg oral dose of fluconazole every third day for a total of 3 doses [days 1, 4, and 7]) is recommended, to attempt mycologic remission, before initiating a maintenance antifungal regimen.

Oral fluconazole (i.e. a 100-mg, 150-mg, or 200-mg dose) weekly for 6 months is the indicated maintenance regimen. If this regimen is not feasible, topical treatments used intermittently can also be considered. Suppressive maintenance therapies are effective at controlling recurrent VVC but are rarely curative long-term. Because C. albicans azole resistance is becoming more common, susceptibility tests, if available, should be obtained among symptomatic patients who remain culture positive despite maintenance therapy. These women should be managed in consultation with a specialist.

Severe Vulvovaginal Candidiasis

Severe VVC (i.e. extensive vulvar erythema, edema, excoriation, and fissure formation) is associated with lower clinical response rates among patients treated with short courses of topical or oral therapy. Either 7–14 days of topical azole or 150 mg of fluconazole in two sequential oral doses (second dose 72 hours after initial dose) is recommended.

Non– albicans Vulvovaginal Candidiasis

Because approximately 50% of women with a positive culture for non– albicans Candida might be minimally symptomatic or have no symptoms, and because successful treatment is often difficult, clinicians should make every effort to exclude other causes of vaginal symptoms for women with non– albicans yeast. The optimal treatment of non– albicans VVC remains unknown; however, a longer duration of therapy (7–14 days) with a nonfluconazole azole regimen (oral or topical) is recommended. If recurrence occurs, 600 mg of boric acid in a gelatin capsule administered vaginally once daily for 3 weeks is indicated. This regimen has clinical and mycologic eradication rates of approximately 70%. If symptoms recur, referral to a specialist is advised.

Management of Sex Partners

No data exist to support treating sex partners of patients with complicated VVC. Therefore, no recommendation can be made.

### A randomized phase 2 study of VT-1161 for the treatment of acute vulvovaginal candidiasis [^fc137212]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

METHODS

Study Design

This was a phase 2, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled, parallel-group, dose-ranging trial designed to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of 3 dose levels of oral VT-1161 compared with a single dose of fluconazole, the current US Food and Drug Administration–approved regimen. The study was conducted at 8 sites in the United States between October 2013 and September 2014.

The available data suggested that VT-1161 plasma exposures of 1–1.5 µg/mL should be clinically effective. This exposure target was therefore chosen to guide the selection of the low-dose arm. Given the safety profile of VT-1161, the mid-dose arm regimen would provide higher exposures (approximately 2-fold greater than the low-dose arm) and would afford the assessment of PK/pharmacodynamic relationships. The study design also afforded the opportunity to escalate to a higher-dose arm.

Participants were randomly assigned to receive 1 of the following dose regimens (Figure 1): VT-1161 300 mg once daily (q.d.) for 3 days (low dose), VT-1161 600 mg q.d. for 3 days (mid dose), or VT-1161 600 mg twice daily (b.i.d.) for 3 days (high dose) or fluconazole 150 mg administered orally in a single dose (administered blinded to match the VT-1161 dose regimens).

### Recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis [^09c889bf]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2016). Low credibility.

Recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis (RVVC) is a common cause of significant morbidity in women in all strata of society affecting millions of women worldwide. Previously, RVVC occurrence was limited by onset of menopause but the widespread use of hormone replacement therapy has extended the at-risk period. Candida albicans remains the dominant species responsible for RVVC, however optimal management of RVVC requires species determination and effective treatment measures are best if species-specific. Considerable progress has been made in understanding risk factors that determine susceptibility to RVVC, particularly genetic factors, as well as new insights into normal vaginal defense immune mechanisms and their aberrations in RVVC. While effective control of RVVC is achievable with the use of fluconazole maintenance suppressive therapy, cure of RVVC remains elusive especially in this era of fluconazole drug resistance. Vaccine development remains a critical challenge and need.

### Phase 2 randomized study of oral ibrexafungerp versus fluconazole in vulvovaginal candidiasis [^cc19ea9d]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

RESULTS

Between August 2017 and May 2018, 293 patients were screened for eligibility, and 186 were enrolled and randomized into 1 of 6 treatment groups (Figure 1, Supplementary Table 1); 153 patients had a confirmed culture for yeast at baseline and were included in the mITT population. All patients included in the mITT population had moderate to severe VVC with VSS scores ranging from 7.0 to 16.0. Based on patient convenience with 1 day dosing and our results demonstrating an increase in gastrointestinal treatment-related treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) with larger doses without a corresponding increase in efficacy, ibrexafungerp 300 mg BID for 1 day was selected as the dose in phase 3 studies (Supplementary Tables 2 and 4). Therefore, results reported here will be limited to ibrexafungerp 300 mg BID for 1 day and fluconazole. A total of 62 patients were enrolled in these 2 treatment groups (ibrexafungerp 300 mg BID for 1 day, n = 30; fluconazole, n = 32); 51 patients were included in the mITT population (ibrexafungerp 300 mg BID for 1 day, n = 27; fluconazole, n = 24). Results for the other treatment groups are provided in the supplement (Supplementary Tables 1, 2, and 4).

### Vulvovaginal candidiasis: a review of the evidence for the 2021 centers for disease control and prevention of sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines [^7d4864e8]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) is a common cause of vulvovaginal itching and discharge. This article discusses the latest CDC STI Treatment Guidelines for VVC.

Methods

A literature search of relevant topics was performed, and a team of experts was convened to discuss (1) diagnosis/testing modalities; treatment of (2) uncomplicated VVC, (3) complicated VVC, and (4) VVC caused by non-albicans yeast; (5) alternative treatment regimens; (6) susceptibility testing of yeast; Special Populations: (7) pregnancy and (8) HIV and VVC.

Results

Yeast culture remains the gold standard for diagnoses. Newer molecular assays have been developed for the diagnosis of VVC and perform well. Azole antifungals remain the treatment of choice for uncomplicated VVC. Two new drugs, TOL-463 and recently FDA-approved ibrexafungerp, appeared promising in clinical trials. For recurrent VVC, oteseconazole, not yet commercially available, may represent a new option. For non-albicans yeast infections in symptomatic patients, boric acid appears useful. No evidence supports the use of alternative treatments, including probiotics. Fluconazole during pregnancy may be associated with spontaneous abortion and craniofacial and heart defects. In women with HIV infection, lower CD4+ T-cell counts are associated with increased rates of VVC, and VVC is associated with increased viral shedding. Treatment measures in women with HIV infection are identical to those women without HIV infection.

Conclusions

There has been significant new knowledge generated about VVC since the 2015 CDC Guidelines which have led to changing recommendations.

### Individualized decreasing-dose maintenance fluconazole regimen for recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis (ReCiDiF trial) [^f1277133]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

Although many women with recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis initially benefit from prophylactic intermittent treatment with antimycotics, most of them experience relapse after cessation of therapy, and often they return to the pretreatment recurrence rate. The purpose of this study was to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of an individualized, degressive, prophylactic regimen in 136 women with recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis.

Study Design

After an induction dose of 600 mg fluconazole during the first week, 117 women started maintenance therapy: 200 mg fluconazole weekly for 2 months, followed by 200 mg biweekly for 4 months, and 200 mg monthly for 6 months, according to their individual response to therapy. All women were tested for recurrences monthly with wet mount microscopy and vaginal culture during the first 6 months and bimonthly during the next 6 months. Patients were allowed to move on to the next level of maintenance therapy only if they were symptom free and microscopy and culture negative.

Results

Of the women who were cured successfully after the induction phase, 101 women (90%) were disease-free after 6 months of maintenance therapy with this degressive regimen, and 80 women (77%) were disease-free after 1 year. The weekly incidence of the first clinical relapse was 0.5% during any period of the maintenance phase, and the rate of all new relapses, which included evidence of mycologic or microscopic colonization, was 1% per week. Women who experienced several relapses (poor responders) had experienced more relapses before entering the study compared with the optimal responders (odds ratio, 4.9; 95% CI,1.8–13.7; P = 0.002), experienced the disease for a longer period of time (6.5 vs 3.7 years; P = 0.06), and harbored significantly more Candida non-albicans during maintenance therapy (P = 0.001). No serious side-effects were noted.

Conclusion

Individualized, degressive, prophylactic maintenance therapy with oral fluconazole is an efficient treatment regimen to prevent clinical relapses in women with recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis.

### A randomized phase 2 study of VT-1161 for the treatment of acute vulvovaginal candidiasis [^3d747e45]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Currently, women with uncomplicated acute VVC are treated with single-dose or short-course treatments; those with complicated, resistant, or recurring VVC (up to 20% of women) require therapy for ≥ 5–7 days and possibly maintenance therapy. Topical agents are limited by local side effects, especially burning, and are messy to apply; therefore, most women prefer oral regimens. Systemically administered available azoles, such as fluconazole, can exhibit toxicity and DDI issues and come with reproductive warnings. Furthermore, resistance surveillance studies have found that current azole therapies can have poor activity against C. glabrata, and cross-resistance among current azole antifungal agents has been observed.

In a previous study that compared a 6-month weekly maintenance fluconazole regimen to placebo in patients with recurrent VVC, the percentage of fluconazole-treated patients who had a recurrence (defined as a clinical severity score of ≥ 3 and vaginal culture positive for yeast) at the 6-month end of maintenance phase visit was 9%. At the 9-month and 12-month observation phase visits, this percentage increased to 27% and 57%, respectively. This trend of increasing recurrence rates in the 6 months following fluconazole treatment is similar to the mycological recurrence rates observed in fluconazole-treated participants in this trial and highlights the unmet medical need for these patients. We have previously reported the potential clinical utility of VT-1161 in women with recurrent VVC. Overall, recurrence rates of culture-proven VVC were only 4% in the 169 VT-1161–treated participants at 9 months after ending the study drug compared with 52% in the 46 women who received placebo. Our current study shows that VT-1161 may also be an effective treatment for acute VVC.

During this trial, VT-1161 was safe and well tolerated at all dose levels through 6 months of follow-up. As an initial phase 2 study with a small number of participants, its main limitation was that it was not powered to permit meaningful comparisons between different treatment groups. Nevertheless, our findings suggest that VT-1161 is worthy of further investigation for both acute and recurrent VVC.

### Phase 2 randomized study of oral ibrexafungerp versus fluconazole in vulvovaginal candidiasis [^b62c353e]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Although more patients receiving ibrexafungerp reported a treatment-related TEAE (46.7% [14/30 patients]) compared with fluconazole (25.0% [8/32 patients]), ibrexafungerp was generally well tolerated, with self-limited (generally 1-day duration), mild to moderate gastrointestinal TEAEs. The incidence and nature of treatment-related TEAEs for fluconazole were similar to those reported for single-dose use in VVC.

The results of our study have clinical implications. Since the approval of fluconazole for the treatment of VVC, no other medications have been approved for this indication. This exploratory phase 2 study, which included a single-dose fluconazole treatment group, suggests that ibrexafungerp may have a potential role in managing a very common infection. With its novel fungicidal mechanism of action and ongoing in vitro activity at lower vaginal pH values where fluconazole activity is decreased, ibrexafungerp has theoretical advantages over existing azole therapies. Furthermore, because preclinical penetration of ibrexafungerp into vaginal tissue is 2- to 9-fold higher than plasma levels, as opposed to ratios of 0.4–0.7 reported clinically with fluconazole, the drug seems to be delivered very effectively to the area that requires treatment. However, it is uncertain how the benefit of these preclinical characteristics of ibrexafungerp will translate in clinical use.

Regarding specific circumstances for vulvovaginal candidiasis, more specifically with respect to patients with HIV (antifungal therapy, uncomplicated disease), HIV.gov 2025 guidelines recommend to administer the following options for the management of uncomplicated VVC:

- fluconazole 150 mg PO for one dose

- topical azoles, such as clotrimazole, butoconazole, miconazole, tioconazole, or terconazole, for 3–7 days

- ibrexafungerp 300 mg PO BID for 1 day

- boric acid 600 mg vaginal suppository once daily for 14 days for azole-refractory C. glabrata vaginitis.

### Phase 2 randomized study of oral ibrexafungerp versus fluconazole in vulvovaginal candidiasis [^b28fd351]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Randomization and Masking

Patients were randomized in equal allocations (at a 1:1:1:1:1:1 ratio) to 1 of 6 treatment groups: oral ibrexafungerp at doses of 750 mg day 1; 300 mg BID for 1 day; 450 mg BID for 1 day; 150 mg BID days 1–3; 300 mg BID days 1–3; or fluconazole 150 mg day 1. Randomization was completed electronically through an interactive web response system. Fluconazole capsules were encapsulated to maintain treatment blinding. All randomized patients received matching ibrexafungerp placebo tablets and/or matching fluconazole placebo capsules based on treatment assignment, in a double-blind, double-dummy fashion. Both active and placebo ibrexafungerp tablets were manufactured by Corealis Pharma; fluconazole active tablets were manufactured by Teva Pharmaceuticals and encapsulated by Corealis Pharma for blinding purposes. All site and sponsor personnel were blinded to treatment assignment except for a sponsor representative who was involved in safety assessments.

Study Assessments

Vulvovaginal samples for 10% KOH microscopic assessment (assessed locally) and fungal culture (assessed by a central laboratory) were collected at baseline, test-of-cure (TOC, day 10), and follow-up (day 25) visits. Susceptibility testing was performed per Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute M27-A3 guidelines for all cultures positive for Candida species. A vulvovaginal sample was also assessed at baseline for pH and other pathogens (eg, bacterial vaginosis, trichomoniasis, N. gonorrheae, C. trachomatis). VSS were assessed using a standardized, predefined scale for which each sign and symptom was given a numerical rating based on severity (absent = 0, mild = 1, moderate = 2, and severe = 3) to calculate a total composite score (range, 0–18). Vulvovaginal signs (edema, erythema, excoriation, or fissures) were rated by the investigator (scale of 0–3; maximum score of 9) and vulvovaginal symptoms (itching, burning, irritation) were rated by the patient (scale of 0–3; maximum score of 9) at baseline, days 1–10 (TOC), and day 25. Safety was assessed by physical exams, hematology and blood chemistry laboratory tests, and vitals at baseline and day 10, and continuous AE monitoring throughout the study.

Discussion

The primary efficacy outcome, therapeutic cure at day 28, was observed in the majority of participants across all treatment groups. Secondary outcome analyses showed similar results as the primary efficacy outcome. Generally, there was no statistical difference between VT-1161 and fluconazole treatment groups; however, the study was not prospectively powered for the primary end point, and sample sizes were small. While the current preliminary study did not differentiate between acute or recurrent VVC participants, requiring only an acute episode at presentation, analyses at the 3-month and 6-month follow-up visits found no indication of mycological recurrence in the VT-1161 groups, while 29% and 46% of participants in the fluconazole group had mycological recurrence at 3 and 6 months, respectively. During the 6-month trial, a higher percentage of fluconazole-treated participants reported TEAEs than VT-1161–treated participants.

### Ibrexafungerp versus placebo for vulvovaginal candidiasis treatment: a phase 3, randomized, controlled superiority trial (VANISH 303) [^186a0398]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

This is the second clinical study to evaluate the efficacy of ibrexafungerp in acute VVC. Our clinical cure rate was similar to that reported with ibrexafungerp 300 mg BID for 1 day (51.9% [14/27 patients]) in the phase 2 DOVE study. Historical comparisons with current therapies for VVC are difficult because of differences in study methodology and dosing regimens. Before the new FDA guidance, study endpoints, including definition of clinical cure, varied widely. Clinical cure was defined as VSS = 0 in our study using the new FDA guidance versus VSS ≤ 2 in many previous azole studies. Clinical cure rates (VSS = 0) of 47.4% to 57.9% on days 7 and 14 have been reported in patients receiving single-dose fluconazole versus 50.5% with single-day ibrexafungerp in our study; clinical cure rate (VSS ≤ 2) of 80.9% on day 14 was reported with single-dose fluconazole versus 70% with ibrexafungerp in our study. However, in our study, an improved and sustained response was observed at the FU visit, whereas some previous studies evaluating various regimens of fluconazole reported an 11%–20% decrease in sustained response from days 7–14 to days 28–35.

Percentage of Participants With Therapeutic Cure at Test-of-Cure Visit Day 28

Table 3.
Secondary Outcome Results for Per-Protocol Population

At day 28, a larger proportion of participants in the PP population experienced clinical cure, mycological cure, clinical improvement, and no clinical or mycological relapse in the 3 VT-1161 treatment groups vs the fluconazole group. At day 28, a larger proportion of participants in the PP population experienced modified therapeutic cure in the 3 VT-1161 treatment groups vs the fluconazole group (Figure 2).

Figure 2.
Modified therapeutic cure of VT-1161 dose regimens vs fluconazole for acute vulvovaginal candidiasis (day 28) in the per-protocol population. Note: Modified therapeutic cure = total VVC signs and symptoms severity score of ≤ 1 and mycological cure at day 28. Abbreviations: b.i.d. twice daily; q.d. once daily; VT-1161, oteseconazole.

All participants treated with VT-1161 demonstrated mycological cure at both the day 84 (3-month) and day 168 (6-month) follow-up visits, while almost half of the participants treated with fluconazole showed a mycological recurrence at the 6-month visit. The percentage of participants in the fluconazole-treated group who experienced mycological recurrence increased with time since treatment.

Additional efficacy analyses included the number of participants with a positive culture for Candida species and KOH test evaluated at days 28, 84, and 168 (Table 4). All participants treated with VT-1161 demonstrated mycological cure at both the day 84 (3-month) and day 168 (6-month) follow-up visits, while almost half of the participants treated with fluconazole showed a mycological recurrence at the 6-month visit.

Special considerations during pregnancy — fluconazole risks and first‑trimester management include the following: Topical therapy is preferable for treatment of oral candidiasis in pregnancy, but is essential for vulvovaginal candidiasis, especially during the first trimester. Fluconazole should not be used at any dose (including a single 150-mg dose) in the first trimester due to the risk of spontaneous abortion, and higher exposures (> 150 mg dosing) in the first trimester are associated with cardiac septal closure defects; five cases of fluconazole embryopathy have been reported with chronic dosing at 400 mg daily or higher in pregnancy. A report from a national cohort register in Denmark found an increased hazard ratio (HR) of 1.48 (95% CI, 1.23–1.77) for spontaneous pregnancy loss with any exposure to oral fluconazole from 7 to 22 weeks of pregnancy, and an increased HR of 1.47 (95% CI, 1.22–1.77) with low-dose (150–300 mg cumulative dose) exposure; no increase in stillbirth was seen broadly, but increased risk of stillbirth (HR, 4.10; CI 95%, 1.89–8.90) occurred with doses > 300 mg. Based on these data, substitution of amphotericin B for fluconazole in the first trimester is recommended for invasive or refractory esophageal candidal infections (AIII), and neonates born to women receiving chronic amphotericin B at delivery should be evaluated for renal dysfunction and hypokalemia.

### Candidiasis (vulvovaginal) [^7f0f7066]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2007). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Vulvovaginal candidiasis is estimated to be the second most common cause of vaginitis after bacterial vaginosis. Candida albicans accounts for 85–90% of cases.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of drug treatments, alternative or complementary treatments for acute vulvovaginal candidiasis in non-pregnant symptomatic women? What are the effects of treating a male sexual partner to resolve symptoms and prevent recurrence in non-pregnant women with symptomatic acute vulvovaginal candidiasis? What are the effects of drug treatments, alternative or complementary treatments for recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis in non-pregnant symptomatic women? What are the effects of treating a male sexual partner in non-pregnant women with symptomatic recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis? What are the effects of treating asymptomatic non-pregnant women with a positive swab for candidiasis? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library and other important databases up to October 2006 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 58 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: alternative or complementary treatments, douching, drug treatments, garlic, intravaginal preparations (boric acid, nystatin, imidazoles, tea tree oil), oral fluconazole, oral itraconazole, treating a male sexual partner, and yoghurt containing Lactobacillus acidophilus (oral or vaginal).

Overview of the Clinical Studies

A total of 656 adults and post-menarchal pediatric females with RVVC (defined as ≥ 3 episodes of vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) in a 12-month period) were randomized in two multicenter, multinational, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials: Trial 1 (NCT#03562156) and Trial 2 (NCT#03561701). A total of 219 adults and post-menarchal pediatric females with RVVC were randomized in a multicenter, double-blind trial [Trial 3 (NCT#03840616)]. Although females of reproductive potential were included in the clinical efficacy data, VIVJOA is contraindicated in females of reproductive potential due to the risk of embryo-fetal toxicity [see Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3, 8.4)].

Trial 1 and Trial 2

Trial 1 and Trial 2 were both randomized, placebo-controlled trials evaluating the efficacy and safety of VIVJOA in the reduction of RVVC. Both trials consisted of two phases: an open-label induction phase and an 11-week maintenance phase. Patients received three sequential doses of 150 mg of fluconazole (every 72 hours) on Days, 1, 4 and 7 during the induction phase. Patients returned 14 days after the first dose of fluconazole and if the acute VVC episode was resolved (vulvovaginal signs and symptoms score < 3) they were randomized (2:1) to receive either 150 mg of VIVJOA or placebo for 7 days followed by 11 weekly doses in the maintenance phase.

In Trial 1, a total of 483 patients were enrolled in the induction phase with 326 patients entering the maintenance phase with 217 patients randomized to VIVJOA and 109 patients randomized to placebo. A total of 182 patients (84%) in the VIVJOA group and 91 patients (83%) in the placebo group completed the trial. The mean age of patients was 34 years old (range 17–78 years old) with 85% of patients aged 18–44 years and 15% of patients aged 45 years and older. Patients were 72% White, 13% Black or African American, 14% Asian, and 8% were of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity.

### Vaginitis in nonpregnant patients: ACOG practice bulletin, number 215 [^ef1658ff]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). High credibility.

Uncomplicated vulvovaginal candidiasis — intravaginal azole therapy or oral fluconazole is recommended for the treatment of uncomplicated vulvovaginal candidiasis, with symptomatic relief and mycologic cure greater than 90%. Imidazole creams and suppositories are available over-the-counter and are easy for most patients to acquire even though most patients prefer a single oral tablet of fluconazole; topical treatments may cause local adverse effects such as burning and irritation. Oral fluconazole is well tolerated and affordable and is equally effective in treating vulvovaginal candidiasis as an intravaginal product, although oral therapy may occasionally cause systemic adverse effects such as gastrointestinal intolerance, headache, and liver function test elevations; however, these effects usually are mild and self-limited, and allergic reactions to oral therapy are rare.

Treatment

Short-course topical formulations (i.e. single dose and regimens of 1–3 days) effectively treat uncomplicated VVC. Treatment with azoles results in relief of symptoms and negative cultures in 80%–90% of patients who complete therapy.

or
Terconazole 80 mg vaginal suppository one suppository daily for 3 days
Oral Agent

The creams and suppositories in these regimens are oil based and might weaken latex condoms and diaphragms. Patients should refer to condom product labeling for further information. Even women who have previously received a diagnosis of VVC by a clinician are not necessarily more likely to be able to diagnose themselves; therefore, any woman whose symptoms persist after using an over-the-counter preparation or who has a recurrence of symptoms < 2 months after treatment for VVC should be evaluated clinically and tested. Unnecessary or unapproved use of over-the-counter preparations is common and can lead to a delay in treatment of other vulvovaginitis etiologies, which can result in adverse outcomes. No substantial evidence exists to support using probiotics or homeopathic medications for treating VVC.

Follow-Up

Follow-up typically is not required. However, women with persistent or recurrent symptoms after treatment should be instructed to return for follow-up visits.

### Oral ibrexafungerp for vulvovaginal candidiasis treatment: an analysis of VANISH 303 and VANISH 306 [^12bd324c]. Journal of Women's Health (2023). Medium credibility.

In addition, historical comparisons of ibrexafungerp and fluconazole are difficult because of varying study methodologies. Several pivotal studies evaluating fluconazole in VVC reported 52%–65% of patients with severe VVC. In a previous study of fluconazole, baseline VSS scores ≥ 7 were associated with reduced response rates with single-dose fluconazole when treating severe VVC compared with mild disease (VSS score < 7). In our pooled analysis, most patients receiving ibrexafungerp had baseline VSS scores ≥ 7 (n = 354) compared with < 7 (n = 22), with the majority of patients receiving ibrexafungerp reporting a baseline VSS score between 8 and 12 (n = 253). Results from this pooled analysis demonstrate that patients with acute VVC, regardless of baseline severity score, can be treated effectively with the convenience of a 1-day dose of ibrexafungerp. In comparison, cases of severe VVC may respond with multiple-day dosing of fluconazole. For severe VVC, current guidelines recommend oral fluconazole every 3 days for a total of two to three doses.

In a prior post hoc analysis, the efficacy of ibrexafungerp was not affected by Black race or BMI > 35. In this pooled analysis, we confirm that race (White and Black) did not affect efficacy outcomes with ibrexafungerp. Analysis of ibrexafungerp in other races is warranted. In addition, BMI did not appear to be a predictor of response with ibrexafungerp based on the fluctuations in relative risk between the various BMI categories.

In the pooled analysis, patients with baseline infections of non- albicans Candida species had lower clinical cure rates than did patients with C albicans infections. Of the non- albicans Candida species, C glabrata was the most common species. Patients with C glabrata infections also had lower clinical cure rates compared with patients with C albicans infections. Despite pooling patient data from the two VANISH studies, the sample size for patients with non- albicans Candida infections remained small, although proportional to epidemiologically reported rates, thereby limiting the interpretation of these results. Nevertheless, continuing evaluation of ibrexafungerp in patients with non- albicans Candida species is warranted. Lower efficacy rates have been previously reported in women treated with fluconazole for non- albicans Candida infections compared with C albicans infection.

Special Considerations

Compromised Host

Women with underlying immunodeficiency, those with poorly controlled diabetes or other immunocompromising conditions (e.g. HIV), and those receiving immunosuppression therapy (e.g. corticosteroid treatment) might not respond as well to short-term therapies. Efforts to correct modifiable conditions should be made, and more prolonged (i.e. 7–14 days) conventional treatment is necessary.

Pregnancy

VVC occurs frequently during pregnancy. Only topical azole therapies, applied for 7 days, are recommended for use among pregnant women. Epidemiologic studies indicate a single 150-mg dose of fluconazole might be associated with spontaneous abortion and congenital anomalies; therefore, it should not be used.

HIV Infection

Vaginal Candida colonization rates among women with HIV infection are higher than among women without HIV with similar demographic and risk behavior characteristics, and the colonization rates correlate with increasing severity of immunosuppression. Symptomatic VVC is also more frequent among women with HIV infection and similarly correlates with severity of immunodeficiency. In addition, among women with HIV, systemic azole exposure is associated with isolation of non– albicans Candida species from the vagina.

Treatment for uncomplicated and complicated VVC among women with HIV infection should not differ from that for women who do not have HIV. Although long-term prophylactic therapy with fluconazole 200 mg weekly has been effective in reducing C. albicans colonization and symptomatic VVC, this regimen is not recommended for women with HIV infection in the absence of complicated VVC. Although VVC is associated with increased HIV seroconversion among HIV-negative women and increased HIV cervicovaginal levels among women with HIV infection, the effect of treatment for VVC on HIV acquisition and transmission remains unknown.

### Itraconazole vs fluconazole for the treatment of uncomplicated acute vaginal and vulvovaginal candidiasis in nonpregnant women: a metaanalysis of randomized controlled trials [^319e80ba]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2008). Low credibility.

In this metaanalysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) we aimed to compare the in vivo and in vitro activity and the safety of per os itraconazole and fluconazole treatment of uncomplicated acute vaginal/vulvovaginal candidiasis in nonpregnant women. We used PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library to identify the studies that were relevant to our metaanalysis RCTs. Six RCTs were included in this study that comprised 1092 enrolled patients with signs and symptoms of vaginal/vulvovaginal candidiasis that was confirmed by microscopy and/or microbiologic cultures that were obtained from the ectocervix and/or vaginal fundus. Overall, there was no difference between itraconazole and fluconazole regarding clinical cure and improvement at the first and second scheduled visit assessments (pooled odds ratio [OR], 0.94 [95% CI, 0.6–1.48] and 1.09 [95% CI, 0.68–1.75], respectively), mycologic cure at the first and second scheduled visit assessments (OR, 0.73 [95% CI, 0.31–1.7] and 0.71 [95% CI, 0.49–1.03], respectively), withdrawal of patients because of severe adverse events (OR, 0.72 [95% CI, 0.16–3.32]), and adverse events noted from the nervous and digestive systems (OR, 1.07 [95% CI, 0.42–2.73] and 1.84 [95% CI, 0.3–11.27], respectively). In conclusion, effectiveness and safety of oral itraconazole and fluconazole in the treatment of acute uncomplicated vaginal/vulvovaginal candidiasis are similar.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^a95220fb]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Pregnancy management of oral and vulvovaginal candidiasis in people with HIV — topical therapy is preferable for treatment of oral candidiasis and vulvovaginal candidiasis in pregnancy, and oral fluconazole should be avoided when treating vulvovaginal candidiasis in the first trimester (AIII). Data derived from women with vulvovaginal candidiasis suggest that fluconazole should not be used at any dose (including a single 150-mg dose) in the first trimester due to the risk of spontaneous abortion, while higher exposures (> 150 mg dosing) during the first trimester are associated with cardiac septal closure defects; however, a recent analysis of registry data from Sweden and Denmark did not find any increase in stillbirth or neonatal death associated with exposure to fluconazole at any dose during pregnancy. Five cases of a syndrome consisting of craniosynostosis, characteristic facies, digital synostosis, and limb contractures (fluconazole embryopathy) have been reported in women chronically prescribed fluconazole at doses of 400 mg daily or higher in pregnancy. A national cohort register in Denmark found an increased hazard ratio (HR) of 1.48 for spontaneous pregnancy loss with any exposure to oral fluconazole from 7 to 22 weeks of pregnancy, and an increased HR of 1.47 was noted with low-dose (150–300 mg cumulative dose) exposure; no increase in stillbirth was seen with fluconazole exposure broadly, but an increase in risk of stillbirth (HR, 4.10) was noted with doses > 300 mg.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^9e530485]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

When to start suppressive therapy — among people with HIV who had CD4 counts < 150 cells/mm3, a randomized clinical trial documented significantly fewer episodes of oropharyngeal candidiasis and other invasive fungal infections with continuous fluconazole therapy (three times a week) than with episodic treatment; this trial also demonstrated no difference in the risk of clinically significant fluconazole resistance between the two fluconazole-treated groups among patients who were receiving ART. However, secondary prophylaxis for recurrent oropharyngeal or vulvovaginal candidiasis is not recommended by most HIV specialists unless people have frequent or severe recurrences (CIII). If recurrences are frequent or severe, oral fluconazole can be used as suppressive therapy for oropharyngeal (BI), esophageal (BI), or vulvovaginal (AII) candidiasis. Oral posaconazole twice daily is also effective for esophageal candidiasis (BII). The potential for development of secondary azole resistance should be considered when contemplating chronic maintenance therapy using azoles in people with HIV who are severely immunocompromised, and several important factors should be considered, including the effect of recurrences on well-being and quality of life, the need for prophylaxis against other fungal infections, cost, adverse events, and drug–drug interactions.

### A randomized phase 2 study of VT-1161 for the treatment of acute vulvovaginal candidiasis [^474fd623]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Determination of Minimum Inhibitory Concentration

The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of VT-1161 and fluconazole against each clinical isolate was determined according to Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute M27-A3. Briefly, 1640 Roswell Park Memorial Institute medium was inoculated and incubated at 35ºC for 24 hours. The MIC end points were recorded at 50% inhibition as compared to the growth control.

Statistical Analyses

A sample size of 12 participants per treatment group was based on clinical judgment; no formal power calculations were performed. Treatment differences were compared using the Cochran–Mantel–Haenszel test. All tests were 2-sided, and inferential analyses used an alpha level of 0.05. All statistical analyses were conducted using SAS version 9.2.

AEs were coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA), version 16.0. The number and percentage of participants who had treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs) were tabulated by system organ class and MedDRA preferred term with a breakdown by treatment group. Mean changes from pretreatment in vital signs, ECGs, and clinical laboratory variables were summarized by treatment group.

The following PK parameters were derived from the plasma concentration vs time data from participants who underwent serial PK sampling after dosing on day 1: maximum measured plasma concentration (C max), area under the plasma concentration vs time curve (AUC), and time to C max (t max).

Three analysis populations were defined as follows: the per-protocol (PP) population included all randomized participants who met all inclusion/exclusion criteria, had a positive baseline vaginal fungal culture Candida species, received all doses of study drug, were compliant with the assigned study treatment, completed the TOC visit within an acceptable time window, had no major protocol violations, and had not received another systemic antifungal drug that has documented activity against the causative organism while on study before the TOC assessment, unless the participant had a therapeutic response of failure. The intent-to-treat (ITT)/safety population included all randomized participants who received ≥ 1 dose of study drug. The modified ITT (mITT) population included all randomized participants who met the inclusion/exclusion criteria, had a positive baseline vaginal fungal culture for Candida species, received ≥ 1 dose of study drug, and returned for ≥ 1 postbaseline visit.

### A randomized phase 2 study of VT-1161 for the treatment of acute vulvovaginal candidiasis [^98f871e0]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Acute vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) is typically treated with a single dose or short treatments of either topical or oral azole antifungals, while recurrent VVC requires treatments that can last ≥ 6 months. Fluconazole remains the current standard of care; however, drug resistance and safety liabilities, including hepatic toxicity, drug–drug interactions (DDIs), pregnancy warnings, and miscarriage concerns, are associated with its use.

VT-1161 (oteseconazole) was designed to be highly selective for fungal CYP51, thus avoiding off-target toxicities, including pregnancy and miscarriage concerns often associated with the azole drug class. Moreover, VT-1161 has demonstrated greater potency against Candida species, including azole-resistant species, than fluconazole. Our goal in this phase 2a study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of VT-1161 vs fluconazole in the treatment of patients with moderate to severe acute VVC.

### Treatment of complicated Candida vaginitis: comparison of single and sequential doses of fluconazole [^40fed10e]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

An attempt was made to validate recent recommendations that women with complicated Candida vaginitis (severe or recurrent, non-albicans Candida spp or abnormal host) require longer-duration antifungal therapy to achieve clinical cure and mycologic eradication.

Study Design

A prospective, multicenter, randomized, double-blind study was performed comparing a single dose of 150 mg of fluconazole with 2 sequential 150-mg doses of fluconazole given 3 days apart.

Results

Five hundred fifty-six women with severe or recurrent Candida vaginitis were enrolled, and 398 had at least one postbaseline evaluation (intent to treat) and of these 309 were fully evaluable (efficacy-valid). At baseline, 92% of vaginal isolates were Candida albicans. The 2-dose fluconazole regimen achieved significantly higher clinical cure rates in women with severe vaginitis when evaluated on day 14 (P = 0.015) and higher clinical and mycologic responses persisted at day 35. Women with recurrent but not severe vaginitis did not benefit clinically short term by the additional fluconazole dose. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that being infected with non-albicans Candida predicted significantly reduced clinical and mycologic response regardless of duration of therapy. Fluconazole therapy was well tolerated and free of serious adverse effects.

Conclusion

Treatment of Candida vaginitis requires individualization, and women with severe Candida vaginitis achieve superior clinical and mycologic eradication with a 2-dose fluconazole regimen.

### Oral ibrexafungerp for vulvovaginal candidiasis treatment: an analysis of VANISH 303 and VANISH 306 [^9275d428]. Journal of Women's Health (2023). Medium credibility.

Safety and tolerability results in this pooled analysis were similar to those reported in the VANISH 303 and VANISH 306 studies, with mild-to-moderate gastrointestinal-related TEAEs being the most commonly reported.

Our study limitations included a very limited enrollment of patients < 18 or ≥ 65 years of age. Although our inclusion criteria permitted females ≥ 12 years of age, no one < 18 years of age received ibrexafungerp. Furthermore, only five patients ≥ 65 years of age, combined from both VANISH studies, were included in the mITT population. Future studies should continue to maintain eligibility criteria for patients ≥ 12 years of age to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ibrexafungerp for VVC in the younger and older patient populations.

Our results are also limited by the exclusion of patients with uncontrolled diabetes mellitus (hemoglobin A1c ≥ 7), which resulted in ∼7% of patients with diabetes mellitus enrolled in the ibrexafungerp and placebo groups. In comparison, historical fluconazole studies have either excluded patients with diabetes mellitusor have treated only a small proportion of patients (4.5% [14 of 309]) with single-dose or two sequential doses of fluconazole. Because diabetes mellitus has been associated with VVC infection, future studies should evaluate the effectiveness of ibrexafungerp in patients with diabetes mellitus, regardless of how well their disease is controlled. A final limitation of our study was the lack of an active comparator. However, FDA industry guidance for the development of drugs for the treatment of VVC advised for the appropriate use of placebo-controlled studies in acute VVC. Future comparative studies are being considered.

### Oral versus intra-vaginal imidazole and triazole anti-fungal treatment of uncomplicated vulvovaginal candidiasis (thrush) [^de625426]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Anti-fungals are available for oral and intra-vaginal treatment of uncomplicated vulvovaginal candidiasis.

Objectives

The primary objective of this review is to assess the relative effectiveness (clinical cure) of oral versus intra-vaginal anti-fungals for the treatment of uncomplicated vulvovaginal candidiasis. Secondary objectives include the assessment of the relative effectiveness in terms of mycological cure, in addition to safety, side effects, treatment preference, time to first relief of symptoms, and costs.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and two trials registers on 29 August 2019 together with reference checking and citation searching.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials published in any language comparing at least one oral anti-fungal with one intra-vaginal anti-fungal in women (aged 16 years or over) with a mycological diagnosis (positive culture, microscopy for yeast, or both) of uncomplicated vulvovaginal candidiasis. We excluded trials if they solely involved participants who were HIV positive, immunocompromised, pregnant, breast feeding or diabetic.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures as recommended by Cochrane.

Main Results

This review includes 26 trials (5007 participants). Eight anti-fungals are represented. All but three trials included participants with acute vulvovaginal candidiasis. Trials were conducted in Europe: UK (3), Croatia (2). Finland (2), the Netherlands (2), Germany (1), Italy (1), Sweden (1) and one trial across multiple European countries, USA (7) Thailand (2), Iran (2), Japan (1) and Africa (Nigeria) (1). The duration of follow-up varied between trials. The overall risk of bias of the included trials was high. There was probably little or no difference shown between oral and intra-vaginal anti-fungal treatment for clinical cure at short-term follow-up (OR 1.14, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.43; 13 trials; 1859 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) and long-term follow-up (OR 1.07, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.50; 9 trials; 1042 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). The evidence suggests that if the rate of clinical cure at short-term follow-up with intra-vaginal treatment is 77%, the rate with oral treatment would be between 75% and 83%; if the rate of clinical cure at long term follow-up with intra-vaginal treatment is 84%, the rate with oral treatment would be between 80% and 89%. Oral treatment probably improves mycological cure over intra-vaginal treatment at short term (OR 1.24, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.50: 19 trials; 3057 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) and long-term follow-up (OR 1.29, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.60; 13 trials; 1661 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). The evidence suggests that if the rate of mycological cure at short-term follow-up with intra-vaginal treatment is 80%, the rate with oral treatment would be between 80% and 85%; if the rate of mycological cure at long-term follow-up with intra-vaginal treatment is 66%, the rate with oral treatment would be between 67% and 76%. In terms of patient safety, there is a low risk of participants withdrawing from the studies due to adverse drug effects for either treatment (23 trials; 4637 participants; high-certainty evidence). Due to the low certainty of evidence, it is undetermined whether oral treatments reduced the number of side effects compared with intra-vaginal treatments (OR 1.04, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.29; 16 trials; 3155 participants; low-certainty evidence). The evidence suggests that if the rate of side effects with intra-vaginal treatment is 12%, the rate with oral treatment would be between 10% and 15%. We noted that the type of side effects differed, with intra-vaginal treatments being more often associated with local reactions, and oral treatments being more often associated with systemic effects including gastro-intestinal symptoms and headaches. Oral treatment appeared to be the favoured treatment preference over intra-vaginal treatment or no preference (12 trials; 2206 participants), however the data were poorly reported and the certainty of the evidence was low. There was little or no difference in time to first relief of symptoms between oral and intra-vaginal treatments: four trials favoured the oral treatment, four favoured intra-vaginal, one study reported no difference and one was unclear. The measurements varied between the 10 trials (1910 participants) and the certainty of the evidence was low. Costs were not reported in any of the trials.

Authors' Conclusions

Oral anti-fungal treatment probably improves short- and long-term mycological cure over intra-vaginal treatment for uncomplicated vaginal candidiasis. Oral treatment was the favoured treatment preference by participants, though the certainty of this evidence is low. The decision to prescribe or recommend an anti-fungal for oral or intra-vaginal administration should take into consideration safety in terms of withdrawals and side effects, as well as cost and treatment preference. Unless there is a previous history of adverse reaction to one route of administration or contraindications, women who are purchasing their own treatment should be given full information about the characteristics and costs of treatment to make their own decision. If health services are paying the treatment cost, decision-makers should consider whether the higher cost of some oral anti-fungals is worth the gain in convenience, if this is the patient's preference.

### Phase 3 study evaluating the safety and efficacy of oteseconazole in the treatment of recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis and acute vulvovaginal candidiasis infections [^a25deb70]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis affects nearly 138 million women globally each year. In the United States, fluconazole is considered the standard of care for acute vulvovaginal candidiasis, but until recently there was no US Food and Drug Administration-approved drug for the treatment of recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis. Oteseconazole is a novel oral selective inhibitor of fungal lanosterol demethylase (sterol 14α-demethylase cytochrome P450, an enzyme required for fungal growth) approved for the treatment of recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis.

Objective

This study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of oral oteseconazole (VT-1161) in the prevention of recurrent culture-verified acute vulvovaginal candidiasis episodes through 50 weeks in participants with recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis and to compare the efficacy of oteseconazole and fluconazole in the treatment of the presenting acute vulvovaginal candidiasis episode.

Study Design

Women and postmenarcheal girls aged ≥ 12 years with a history of recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis (N = 219) were enrolled at 38 US sites. Eligible participants presenting with an active vulvovaginal candidiasis infection entered an induction phase in which they were randomly assigned 2:1 to receive 600 mg oral oteseconazole on day 1 and 450 mg on day 2, with matching placebo capsules, or to 3 sequential 150-mg oral doses (once every 72 hours) of fluconazole, with matching placebo capsules. Following the 2-week induction phase, the 185 participants with resolved acute vulvovaginal candidiasis infection (a clinical signs and symptoms score of < 3) entered the maintenance phase and received 150 mg of oteseconazole or placebo weekly for 11 weeks. Participants were observed for an additional 37 weeks.

Results

In the induction phase, oteseconazole was noninferior to fluconazole in the proportion of participants in the intent-to-treat population with resolved acute vulvovaginal candidiasis infection at the week 2 (day 14) test-of-cure visit, with 93.2% of participants on oteseconazole vs 95.8% on fluconazole achieving resolution. In the maintenance phase, oteseconazole was superior to placebo in the proportion of participants in the intent-to-treat population with ≥ 1 culture-verified acute vulvovaginal candidiasis episode through 50 weeks, 5.1% compared with 42.2%, respectively (P < .001). Overall, treatment-emergent adverse event rates were similar in both groups: 54% for participants who received oteseconazole in the induction and maintenance phases vs 64% for participants who received fluconazole in the induction phase and placebo in the maintenance phase. Most treatment-emergent adverse events in each group were mild or moderate, with 3.4% of treatment-emergent adverse events graded as severe or higher in the OTESECONAZOLE/oteseconazole group vs 4.2% in FLUCONAZOLE/placebo group.

Conclusion

In participants with recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis, oteseconazole was safe and efficacious in the treatment and prevention of recurrent acute vulvovaginal candidiasis episodes and was noninferior to vulvovaginal candidiasis standard-of-care fluconazole in the treatment of the presenting acute vulvovaginal candidiasis infection.

### Oral fluconazole use in the first trimester and risk of congenital malformations: population based cohort study [^45ebb949]. BMJ (2020). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Vulvovaginal candidiasis is common in pregnant women. For women with uncomplicated vulvovaginal candidiasis, the recommended treatment is a short course of topical antifungal agents or one 150 mg dose of oral fluconazole. Although topical antifungal treatment is available over the counter in many countries, oral fluconazole is often preferred by patients because of the convenience of taking one oral dose.

Oral fluconazole given in the first trimester of pregnancy has steadily increased over time, from 1.1% in 2000 to 2.6% in 2014 in the United States (eFigure 1). In vitro and in vivo studies in rodents suggest that high doses of fluconazole can be embryotoxic and teratogenic, causing cleft palate and skeletal abnormalities. Case reports also suggest a potential teratogenic effect in humans associated with long term use of high dose (≥ 400 mg/day) fluconazole during pregnancy. The malformations have a distinct phenotype, including femoral bowing, thin ribs, cleft palate, and abnormal craniofacial ossification. Several controlled studies have examined the risk of congenital malformations associated with the use of fluconazole for the treatment of vulvovaginal candidiasis during the first trimester but findings are inconsistent. Although early studies reported no increased risks of congenital malformations overall, more recent studies reported increased risks for specific malformations based on small numbers of women exposed to fluconazole, including a threefold increased risk of tetralogy of Fallot (seven affected infants in the exposed group), a sevenfold increased risk of d-transposition of the great arteries (three affected infants in the exposed group), and a fivefold increased risk of cleft lip with cleft palate (six affected infants in the exposed group). These increased risks for specific malformations have not been replicated across studies, possibly because of random variability, given the small sample size and multiple testing, residual confounding, or recall biasin previous studies. The risk of musculoskeletal malformations could not be estimated or was inconclusive given the wide confidence intervals in the existing literature owing to limited power. The safety of fluconazole at commonly used doses for the treatment of vulvovaginal candidiasis is thus largely undefined (eTable 1).

### A randomized phase 2 study of VT-1161 for the treatment of acute vulvovaginal candidiasis [^2a826a3c]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Table 4.
Number of Participants With Positive Culture and Potassium Hydroxide Test During Follow-up for Intent-to-Treat Population (Mycological Recurrence)

At screening, 41 isolated cultures (89%) were Candida albicans, 9 isolated cultures (7%) were Candida parapsilosis, 1 culture (2%) was Candida tropicalis, and 1 culture (2%) was Candida lusitanea. Candida glabrata was isolated from a single participant while on-study. Based on the MIC susceptibility results, VT-1161 was shown to have potent activity against the Candida strains obtained in the study. When all 60 Candida spp. isolates collected throughout the study were considered, the MIC ranges for VT-1161 and fluconazole were < 0.001–1.0 and < 0.125–64 µg/mL, respectively. The MIC 50 (defined as the minimum concentration to inhibit 50% of the strains tested) was 0.002 µg/mL for VT-1161 and 0.25 µg/mL for fluconazole, whereas the MIC 90 (defined as the minimum concentration to inhibit 90% of the strains tested) was 0.004 µg/mL for VT-1161 and 1.0 µg/mL for fluconazole. Overall, the VT-1161 MIC values were approximately 100-fold lower than those of fluconazole. Importantly, the MIC of VT-1161 against the fluconazole-resistant C. glabrata was 64-fold lower than the fluconazole MIC.

Pharmacokinetics

The median t max of VT-1161 was 4.0 hours (range, 3.1–5.0) and 5.5 hours (range, 4.0–8.0) for the 300- and 600-mg doses, respectively. On day 1, C max was 407 ng/mL for the 300-mg dose and 968 ng/mL for the 600-mg dose. The AUC (0–8) values on day 1 averaged 1870 and 4230 hours × ng/mL for the 300- and 600-mg doses, respectively.

VT-1161 concentrations on day 168 remained measurable (127, 409, and 1300 ng/mL for the 300 mg q.d. 600 mg q.d. and 600 mg b.i.d. treatment groups, respectively). Median half-lives for the current study were calculated as 76 days for the low dose to 160 days for the high dose cohort.

### Ibrexafungerp in the treatment of vulvovaginal candidiasis [^d93ab1b3]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

To review the pharmacology, efficacy, and safety of ibrexafungerp in the management of vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC).

Data Sources

Literature was sought using PubMed (1966-February 2022) and EMBASE (1973-February 2022), and clinicaltrials.gov. Search terms included ibrexafungerp, SCY-078, and VVC.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

All studies including humans and published in English with data assessing the efficacy and safety of ibrexafungerp for the treatment of VVC were evaluated.

Data Synthesis

A phase 2 dose-finding study found ibrexafungerp had similar efficacy to fluconazole in the clinical cure of VVC (51.9% vs 58.3%, respectively). Two phase 3 clinical trials demonstrated ibrexafungerp had statistical superiority over placebo for clinical cure in moderate to severe VVC (P < 0.001 and P = 0.023, respectively). The most frequently reported adverse reactions in the clinical trials were gastrointestinal-related symptoms. To date, data comparing efficacy of ibrexafungerp and topical imidazoles in the treatment of VVC are nonexistent.

Relevance To Patient Care and Clinical Practice

Topical imidazoles and oral fluconazole are effective for the treatment of uncomplicated VVC. Due to increased resistance, limited fluconazole coverage for non- Candida albicans species, and potential for significant drug interactions associated with fluconazole use, alternative treatments for VVC are needed. Ibrexafungerp is a new oral triterpenoid antifungal agent indicated for the treatment of VVC. Additional clinical trials are needed to evaluate long-term safety data as well as efficacy and safety in specialty populations.

Conclusion

Ibrexafungerp, a recently approved triterpenoid antifungal agent, is an effective and well-tolerated option for the treatment of VVC.

### Treatment for recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis (thrush) [^9284aba4]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis (RVVC) affects up to 5% of women. No comprehensive systematic review of treatments for RVVC has been published.

Objectives

The primary objective was to assess the effectiveness and safety of pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments for RVVC. The secondary objective was to assess patient preference of treatment options.

Search Methods

We conducted electronic searches of bibliographic databases, including CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and CINAHL (search date 6 October 2021). We also handsearched reference lists of identified trials and contacted authors of identified trials, experts in RVVC, and manufacturers of products for vulvovaginal candidiasis.

Selection Criteria

We considered all published and unpublished randomised controlled trials evaluating RVVC treatments for at least six months, in women with four or more symptomatic episodes of vulvovaginal candidiasis in the past year. We excluded women with immunosuppressive disorders or taking immunosuppressant medication. We included women with diabetes mellitus and pregnant women. Diagnosis of RVVC must have been confirmed by presence of symptoms and a positive culture and/or microscopy. We included all drug and non-drug therapies and partner treatment, assessing the following primary outcomes:

- number of clinical recurrences per participant per year (recurrence defined as clinical signs and positive culture/microscopy);
- proportion of participants with at least one clinical recurrence during the treatment and follow-up period; and
- adverse events.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently reviewed titles and abstracts to identify eligible trials. Duplicate data extraction was completed independently by two authors. We assessed risk of bias as described in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. We used the fixed-effects model for pooling and expressed the results as risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Where important statistical heterogeneity was present we either did not pool data (I 2 > 70%) or used a random-effects model (I 2 40–70%). We used the GRADE tool to assess overall certainty of the evidence for the pooled primary outcomes.

Main Results

Studies: Twenty-three studies involving 2212 women aged 17 to 67 years met the inclusion criteria. Most studies excluded pregnant women and women with diabetes or immunosuppression. The predominant species found on culture at study entry was Candida albicans. Overall, the included studies were small (< 100 participants). Six studies compared antifungal treatment with placebo (607 participants); four studies compared oral versus topical antifungals (543 participants); one study compared different oral antifungals (45 participants); two studies compared different dosing regimens for antifungals (100 participants); one study compared two different dosing regimens of the same topical agent (23 participants); one study compared short versus longer treatment duration (26 participants); two studies assessed the effect of partner treatment (98 participants); one study compared a complementary treatment (Lactobacillus vaginal tablets and probiotic oral tablets) with placebo (34 participants); three studies compared complementary medicine with antifungals (354 participants); two studies compared 'dermasilk' briefs with cotton briefs (130 participants); one study examined Lactobacillus vaccination versus heliotherapy versus ciclopyroxolamine (90 participants); one study compared CAM treatments to an antifungal treatment combined with CAM treatments (68 participants). We did not find any studies comparing different topical antifungals. Nine studies reported industry funding, three were funded by an independent source and eleven did not report their funding source. Risk of bias: Overall, the risk of bias was high or unclear due to insufficient blinding of allocation and participants and poor reporting. Primary outcomes: Meta-analyses comparing drug treatments (oral and topical) with placebo or no treatment showed there may be a clinically relevant reduction in clinical recurrence at 6 months (RR 0.36, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.63; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) = 2; participants = 607; studies = 6; I² = 82%; low-certainty evidence) and 12 months (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.89; NNTB = 6; participants = 585; studies = 6; I² = 21%; low-certainty evidence). No study reported on the number of clinical recurrences per participant per year. We are very uncertain whether oral drug treatment compared to topical treatment increases the risk of clinical recurrence at 6 months (RR 1.66, 95% CI 0.83 to 3.31; participants = 206; studies = 3; I² = 0%; very low-certainty evidence) and reduces the risk of clinical recurrence at 12 months (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.27; participants = 206; studies = 3; I² = 10%; very low-certainty evidence). No study reported on the number of clinical recurrences per participant per year. Adverse events were scarce across both treatment and control groups in both comparisons. The reporting of adverse events varied amongst studies, was generally of very low quality and could not be pooled. Overall the adverse event rate was low for both placebo and treatment arms and ranged from less than 5% to no side effects or complications.

Authors' Conclusions

In women with RVVC, treatment with oral or topical antifungals may reduce symptomatic clinical recurrences when compared to placebo or no treatment. We were unable to find clear differences between different treatment options (e.g. oral versus topical treatment, different doses and durations). These findings are not applicable to pregnant or immunocompromised women and women with diabetes as the studies did not include or report on them. More research is needed to determine the optimal medication, dose and frequency.

### Single-dose fluconazole for vulvovaginal candidiasis: impact on prothrombin time in women taking warfarin [^e1163ef1]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To estimate the effect of a single oral 150-mg dose of fluconazole on the prothrombin time of women on long-term warfarin therapy.

Methods

Women on warfarin therapy for 6 months or more with no change in dose within 4 weeks of the study, and a prothrombin time (PT) with an International Normalized Ratio (INR) between 2 and 3 were invited to participate. Two consecutive baseline PTs were obtained (days -1 and 0), and women were given 150 mg of fluconazole. Prothrombin times were measured on days 2, 5, and 8 of the study. The change in PT was calculated from the difference between the baseline PT on day 0 and the PT during the study period. To detect a 10% difference in a PT (approximately 2.1 seconds) of a patient with an INR of 2.0, at P < .05 and a power of 90%, 5 subjects are required.

Results

Six women participated. The mean (± standard deviation) PT for day 0 was 27.7 ± 4.1 seconds or INR 2.6 ± 0.4. The PT increased 11% at day 2, 34% at day 5, and 2% at day 8; these differences were not statistically significant. However, one half of the women had either a clinically relevant increase of the INR greater than 4, or bleeding that required their dosage of warfarin to be decreased.

Conclusion

A single 150-mg oral dose of fluconazole may increase the PT to a clinically relevant level in a woman on chronic warfarin therapy. Clinicians should monitor the PT carefully after a single dose of fluconazole.
