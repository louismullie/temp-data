## Question

What causes cherry-red spot on the retina in an infant

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the causes of a cherry-red spot on the retina in an infant. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiology of the cherry-red spot and whether it reflects ischemia versus storage. Then, I should categorize infantile etiologies into vascular occlusive causes versus lysosomal storage diseases. Next, I will prioritize the most likely storage diseases in infants and outline the vascular mimics that can occur in children. After that, I need to consider why the spot may be absent despite disease and how to confirm the diagnosis. Finally, I will synthesize a practical differential and immediate next steps for evaluation and referral, making sure I verify each claim against the literature as I go.

> Let me first confirm the pathophysiologic basis of the cherry-red spot. The classic appearance arises from two distinct mechanisms: ischemic inner retinal whitening that spares the foveola, creating a red fovea against a pale background, or metabolic accumulation of storage material in retinal ganglion cells that opacifies the perifovea while the fovea remains relatively clear, again producing a red spot at the macula. I should double-check that both mechanisms are well documented, and yes, CRAO literature supports the ischemic mechanism while lysosomal storage disease literature supports the storage mechanism, including OCT evidence of increased inner retinal reflectivity in both contexts [^114Pcng7] [^115tWxSa] [^115SGerW].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about vascular causes in infants. CRAO is classically an adult vascular emergency, but it can occur in children, including reports in sickle cell disease and other pediatric contexts; the mechanism is the same — inner retinal ischemia with foveal sparing — so I should keep pediatric CRAO on the list, especially with acute presentation or systemic risk factors, while remembering that the incidence of visible cherry-red spots in CRAO is variable and may be absent in a substantial fraction of cases, which complicates bedside diagnosis [^117QB5DZ] [^113GM7gn] [^1147yLpH].

> Next, I should review lysosomal storage diseases, which are the leading cause of cherry-red spots in infants. GM2 gangliosidoses, including Tay-Sachs and Sandhoff disease, typically present in early infancy with neurodevelopmental regression, seizures, hyperacusis, and a macular cherry-red spot; I need to ensure I anchor this to enzyme-deficiency biology and typical timelines, and the literature confirms infantile onset with HEXA or HEXB mutations and the macular sign by several months of age [^111atpKL] [^116HmCmj] [^114ovtwg].

> Wait, let me verify the other major infantile storage entities. Niemann-Pick disease type A is classically associated with cherry-red spots by about 12 months in essentially all patients, alongside hepatosplenomegaly and a rapidly progressive neurodegenerative course; I should confirm that this is consistent across cohorts, and yes, longitudinal series document universal macular involvement by one year with early mortality, reinforcing its importance in the infant differential [^111Eks48].

> I will now examine GM1 gangliosidosis. The severe infantile type I form often features a cherry-red spot with coarse facies, skeletal dysplasia, and hepatosplenomegaly, whereas the later-onset type II form typically lacks the macular sign. I should double-check that distinction, and the clinical literature supports the presence of cherry-red spots in type I and their absence in type II, which helps with age-stratified reasoning in infants versus older children [^111atpKL] [^115tFMRZ].

> But wait, what about sialidosis in infants. Initially, I thought sialidosis type I is uniformly late-onset and therefore not relevant to infants; hold on, I should verify the phenotypes. Sialidosis type II includes early infantile forms that can present in infancy, and although the macular cherry-red spot is a hallmark of type I, it may be absent or subtle early in disease, so I must not exclude sialidosis solely because the spot is not obvious on exam; OCT hyperreflectivity and genetic testing can unmask the diagnosis in such cases [^1141nyCg] [^113AG8Zj] [^113uRQeH].

> Let me consider additional storage disorders that can rarely present with a cherry-red spot in infancy. Farber disease due to acid ceramidase deficiency has been associated with a grayish retina and cherry-red spot in animal models and case descriptions, and although human infant data are limited, it remains a plausible but uncommon cause; I should acknowledge this as a rare consideration after more common entities are excluded [^112zNXxa].

> Next, I should review why the cherry-red spot may be absent despite disease. Factors include early presentation before clear macular changes, milder or atypical genotypes, and skin tone or fundus pigmentation that reduces contrast. Importantly, OCT can reveal increased inner retinal reflectivity even when the fundus sign is equivocal, and some cohorts show a notable proportion of genetically confirmed sialidosis without visible spots, so I need to ensure I do not over-rely on the red reflex alone [^1172cND6] [^113AG8Zj] [^116YXJb2] [^1163pGtD].

> I need to ensure the diagnostic approach is systematic. In any infant with a cherry-red spot or unexplained vision loss, I should obtain urgent ophthalmology referral, targeted metabolic and genetic testing for GM2 gangliosidoses, GM1 gangliosidosis, Niemann-Pick disease, and sialidosis, and consider enzyme assays and urine oligosaccharide analysis. OCT and fundus autofluorescence can support storage disease when the spot is subtle, and newborn screening pathways and pediatric red reflex protocols reinforce early detection and referral, which I should verify against current guidance [^116TzDVv] [^111R7LnV] [^115r6mDu] [^114ur1WJ].

> Let me synthesize the differential succinctly. In infants, the most likely causes of a macular cherry-red spot are lysosomal storage diseases, particularly GM2 gangliosidoses such as Tay-Sachs and Sandhoff disease, Niemann-Pick disease type A, and GM1 gangliosidosis type I, with sialidosis type II as an additional consideration. Vascular causes like CRAO are less common but possible, especially in the setting of sickle cell disease or other pediatric vasculopathies, and the absence of a visible spot does not exclude storage disease, so ancillary imaging and genetics are essential [^111L4YRM] [^111Eks48] [^111atpKL] [^117QB5DZ] [^1172cND6].

> Finally, I should confirm immediate next steps. If a cherry-red spot is suspected or documented, arrange urgent pediatric ophthalmology and metabolic genetics evaluation, obtain OCT and consider FAF to characterize inner retinal changes, and initiate targeted enzyme testing and molecular panels for GM2, GM1, Niemann-Pick, and NEU1/CTSA genes. Early recognition informs counseling, supportive care, and eligibility for emerging therapies and clinical trials, and it prevents delays from over-reliance on the classic fundus sign alone [^111R7LnV] [^116TzDVv] [^111L4YRM] [^1141nyCg] [^114ur1WJ].

---

A cherry-red spot in an infant's retina is most often due to **lysosomal storage disorders** such as Tay-Sachs, Sandhoff, GM1 gangliosidosis, Niemann-Pick type A, or sialidosis, caused by inherited enzyme deficiencies that lead to ganglion cell storage and macular sparing [^111L4YRM] [^1141nyCg]. Less commonly, it results from **retinal ischemia** due to central retinal artery occlusion or ophthalmic artery occlusion, where inner retinal whitening accentuates the fovea's normal red hue [^114Pcng7]. Prompt recognition and **urgent ophthalmology referral** are essential to distinguish storage disease from vascular causes and guide genetic testing, enzyme assays, and imaging [^114d5PFE] [^114ur1WJ] [^116TzDVv].

---

## Pathophysiology of cherry-red spot

The cherry-red spot reflects two main mechanisms: **lysosomal storage disorders**, in which ganglion cell storage opacifies the perifovea while the foveola (lacking ganglion cells) remains clear, creating contrast [^114ur1WJ]; and **retinal ischemia**, in which inner retinal whitening from ischemia makes the fovea appear relatively red due to its choroidal supply [^114d5PFE].

---

## Lysosomal storage disorders

Lysosomal storage disorders are the **most common cause** of cherry-red spots in infants, resulting from inherited enzyme deficiencies that cause substrate accumulation in retinal ganglion cells [^115SGerW].

| **Disorder** | **Enzyme deficiency** | **Clinical features** | **Cherry-red spot frequency** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Tay-Sachs disease | Hexosaminidase A (HEXA) | - Neurodegeneration <br/> - Seizures <br/> - Developmental regression <br/> - Death by ~3–5 years [^111L4YRM] | Very common |
| Sandhoff disease | Hexosaminidase A and B (HEXA, HEXB) | - Similar to Tay-Sachs <br/> - Hepatosplenomegaly [^111L4YRM] | Very common |
| GM1 gangliosidosis | β-galactosidase (GLB1) | - Neurodegeneration <br/> - Hepatosplenomegaly <br/> - Skeletal dysplasia [^111atpKL] | Common |
| Niemann-Pick disease type A | Acid sphingomyelinase (SMPD1) | - Hepatosplenomegaly <br/> - Neurodegeneration <br/> - Death by ~2–3 years [^111Eks48] | Common |
| Sialidosis (mucolipidosis I) | Neuraminidase 1 (NEU1) | - Myoclonus <br/> - Ataxia <br/> - Progressive vision loss [^1141nyCg] | Common |

## Retinal ischemia

Retinal ischemia from vascular occlusion is a **less common but critical** cause of a cherry-red spot in infants, requiring emergent evaluation [^114Pcng7].

- **Central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO)**: Sudden, painless vision loss with retinal whitening and a cherry-red spot; rare in infants but reported with embolic or thrombotic events [^114Pcng7] [^111tfJ1m].
- **Ophthalmic artery occlusion**: More extensive ischemia involving both retinal and choroidal circulations; the cherry-red spot may be absent or less distinct due to choroidal nonperfusion [^112Sbni5].

---

## Diagnostic approach

A structured approach is essential to distinguish storage disease from ischemia and guide management:

- **Clinical history**: Family history, ethnicity, age of onset, systemic symptoms (hepatosplenomegaly, neurodevelopmental regression) [^111R7LnV].
- **Ophthalmic examination**: Funduscopy, OCT (inner retinal hyperreflectivity), fluorescein angiography (delayed filling) [^114Pcng7].
- **Genetic testing**: Targeted panels or whole-exome sequencing for lysosomal storage disorders [^113oK5A6].
- **Enzyme assays**: Leukocyte or fibroblast enzyme activity for specific deficiencies (e.g. HEXA, HEXB, GLB1, SMPD1, NEU1) [^116TzDVv].
- **Imaging**: MRI for neurodegeneration, echocardiography for embolic sources if ischemia is suspected [^113XJ5xm].

---

## Clinical implications and management

The presence of a cherry-red spot in an infant is a **red flag** for serious systemic disease. Lysosomal storage disorders require **genetic counseling**, supportive care, and consideration of experimental therapies (e.g. enzyme replacement, gene therapy) [^111L4YRM]. Retinal ischemia demands **urgent stroke-protocol management**, including hyperbaric oxygen, intra-arterial thrombolysis, or anticoagulation, though outcomes are often poor if delayed [^114ivcca] [^111tfJ1m].

---

A cherry-red spot in an infant most often reflects a **lysosomal storage disorder** due to ganglion cell storage, but retinal ischemia from vascular occlusion must be excluded. Rapid **diagnosis and referral** are critical to guide genetic testing, enzyme assays, and imaging, and to inform counseling and management.

### Pediatric liver diseases and ocular changes: what hepatologists and ophthalmologists should know and share with each other [^115JKn33]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2020). Medium credibility.

Several rare pediatric liver disorders are accompanied by ophthalmic signs whose awareness and early identification may be of value in confirming/accelerating their diagnosis. Many of these signs are asymptomatic and can only be detected with an ophthalmological examination. Corneal signs are described in patients with Wilson's disease, Alagille's syndrome and some liver storage diseases. Cataract plays an important role to diagnose galactosemia. Retinal involvement is seen in some peroxisomal disorders (e.g. Zellweger's syndrome), in mucopolysaccharidoses (pigmentary retinopathy), and in Niemann-Pick disease (macular cherry red spot). In mucopolysaccharidoses optic nerve can be involved as optic atrophy secondary to pigmentary retinopathy or to chronic papilledema. Children with neonatal cholestasis due to hypopituitarism may present septo-optic dysplasia. Several infectious agents have an ophthalmological/hepatic involvement in the fetal life and/or thereafter. Some mitochondrial liver diseases, such as Pearson's syndrome, present pigmentary retinopathy and a chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia. Finally, some drugs while protecting the liver may damage the ocular system as seen with long-term glucocorticoids and Nitisinone administration. This review provides a synopsis of those conditions that hepatologists and ophthalmologists should share among themselves to better take care of patients. Synoptic tables are presented to facilitate the mutual understanding of the issues.

### Juvenile-onset G (M2)-gangliosidosis in an African-American child with nystagmus [^1148FoTr]. Pediatric Neurology (2008). Low credibility.

G(M2)-gangliosidosis is a neurodegenerative lysosomal disease with several clinical variants. We describe a 2-year-old black child with juvenile-onset disease, who presented with abnormal eye movements and cherry-red spots of the maculae. Mutation analysis of the HEXA gene revealed the patient to be a compound heterozygote (M1V/Y37N). The M1V mutation was previously described in an African-American child with acute infantile G(M2)-gangliosidosis. The Y37N mutation is novel. This combination of mutations is consistent with juvenile-onset disease, and provides further evidence for the association of the M1V mutation with individuals of black ancestry. The presence of oculomotor abnormalities is an unusual finding in this form of G(M2)-gangliosidosis, and adds to the phenotypic spectrum.

### Sialidosis type 1 without cherry-red spots: a case report and literature review [^1179P2iw]. BMJ Neurology Open (2024). High credibility.

In 2009, 17 confirmed cases of type I sialidosis were reported in Taiwan, with a significantly lower incidence of cherry-red spots than other regions. Only three cases were detected with cherry-red spots after over 10 years of follow-up. In patients diagnosed in Taiwan and mainland China, the most common types of mutations arec.544A > G. In contrast, the chance of cherry-red spots appearing in type I sialidosis reported in mainland China is notably higher than in Taiwan. In this report, our first patient from the Hainan Free Trade Port caused by a mutation in this gene c.544A > G, and the patient did not show cherry-red spots in the fundus. Given the geographical proximity to Taiwan, we hypothesise that the presence of cherry-red spots may be related to the environment. Additionally, besides macular cherry-red spots, some reports have noted that punctate cataracts and corneal clouding are characteristic ophthalmic signs of sialidosis.

### Intra-arterial thrombolysis for central retinal artery occlusion [^111tfJ1m]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

CRAO presents as acute, painless visual loss typically in patients above the age of 50. Visual loss is rarely complete blindness with up to 75% of patients having a visual acuity (VA) of counting fingers (CF). The typical acute fundus findings are retinal opacification, a cherry-red spot, sludging of red blood cells, venous attenuation, and optic disc pallor (Figure 1). Late changes include retinal pigment epithelial changes, sheathed arteries, attenuated veins, optic disc atrophy and cilioretinal collaterals.

Figure 1
Widefield imaging showing classical features of CRAO: pale retina with a cherry-red spot in the right eye.

Embolism is the most common cause of central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO) and two-thirds of cases are caused by emboli secondary to atherosclerosis of the internal carotid artery (ICA). Plaque in the ICA is the most common source of microemboli. The three commonest types of visible emboli are cholesterol, platelet-fibrin and calcific emboli. Embolus composition is important with respect to thrombolytic therapy as only platelet-fibrin emboli would be susceptible to it. Historically, cholesterol emboli were shown to be the most common type in a study by Arruga et alof 70 patients with retinal embolism which showed that 57% were cholesterol, 11% platelet-fibrin and approximately 9% calcific. However, the commonest location of occlusion is at the narrowest part of the CRA lumen where it enters the dural sheath of the optic nerveand thus this may not be representative of retrobulbar emboli.

### Central retinal artery occlusion without cherry-red spots [^114d5PFE]. BMC Ophthalmology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO) is an ophthalmic emergency that results in a poor visual outcome. A literature review showed that the window of treatment for total CRAO is 90–240 min. Therefore, accurate diagnosis and timely management of CRAO are very important for improving patient prognosis.

Currently, fluorescein angiography (FA) remains the gold standard for diagnosing CRAO. However, FA is an invasive and time-consuming examination that takes at least 20 min. Twenty minutes might be just a moment for normal human beings, but it is a long time for someone who is experiencing retinal infarction. In addition, patients with a history of severe allergies, asthma and renal dysfunction cannot undergo FA. A recent study of CRAO by Abdellah MM showed a delayed arteriovenous transit time > 23 s in 53.33% of cases and normal FA results in 26.67% of cases, thus providing a challenge to its role in diagnosing CRAO.

The clinical diagnosis of CRAO depends on history and funduscopic examination. However, CRAO associated with normal-appearing retinal vessels and observable emboli is not rare. Among the funduscopic findings of CRAO, cherry-red spots are the most recognizable and typical sign. In CRAO, the reddish color of the vascular choroid and pigment epithelium is still seen through the foveola, which is surrounded by an area of the white/opacified retina; this gives rise to the typical cherry-red spot. Cherry-red spots usually become evident after several hours of ischaemia and usually persist for several days after CRAO. In most cases, the diagnosis of CRAO can be made by assessing patient history and obtaining fundoscopic findings of cherry red spots. The critical time from onset of artery occlusion to inner retinal infarction represents a window for emergency treatment to prevent catastrophic visual loss. Rapid clinical diagnosis of CRAO helps to quickly implement therapeutic interventions within the window and maximize the recovery of patients' visual function. The absence of cherry-red spots is a challenge for the diagnosis of CRAO at the first visit and might delay various treatments.

### GM1 gangliosidosis type II: results of a 10-year prospective study [^115tFMRZ]. Genetics in Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose

GM1 gangliosidosis (GM1) a lysosomal disorder caused by pathogenic variants in GLB1, is characterized by relentless neurodegeneration. There are no approved treatments.

Methods

Forty-one individuals with type II (late-infantile and juvenile) GM1 participated in a single-site prospective observational study.

Results

Classification of 37 distinct variants using American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics criteria resulted in the upgrade of 6 and the submission of 4 new variants. In contrast to type I infantile disease, children with type II had normal or near normal hearing and did not have cherry-red maculae or hepatosplenomegaly. Some older children with juvenile onset disease developed thickened aortic and/or mitral valves. Serial magnetic resonance images demonstrated progressive brain atrophy, more pronounced in late infantile patients. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy showed worsening elevation of myo-inositol and deficit of N-acetyl aspartate that were strongly correlated with scores on the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale, progressing more rapidly in late infantile compared with juvenile onset disease.

Conclusion

Serial phenotyping of type II GM1 patients expands the understanding of disease progression and clarifies common misconceptions about type II patients; these are pivotal steps toward more timely diagnosis and better supportive care. The data amassed through this 10-year effort will serve as a robust comparator for ongoing and future therapeutic trials.

### Central retinal artery occlusion without cherry-red spots [^1142v3GK]. BMC Ophthalmology (2023). Medium credibility.

Comparison of CRAO with or without cherry red spots

In patients with CRAO, intracellular oedema occurs in inner retinal cells due to ischaemia and hypoxia, which manifests as increased hyperreflectivity of the inner retina on OCT. Retinal cells are nerve cells that have high metabolism and high oxygen consumption. In the present study, 90.33% of CRAO patients without cherry red spots had high reflection of the inner retina, while all patients with cherry red spots had high inner retina reflection. The difference between these two groups was significant (Table 3, p = 0.047). With the progression of ischaemia, extracellular oedema develops in the posterior retina, including the macula, manifesting as typical posterior retinal opacity. The median central macular thickness in CRAO patients with and without cherry red spots was 180 μm and 166 μm, respectively. The difference between these two groups was not significant (Table 3, p = 0.467).

Table 3
Comparison of OCT characteristics between CRAO without cherry red spots and CRAO with cherry red spots

Delayed arteriovenous transit time could be seen in most CRAO patients. The CRAO without cherry-red spots group had a higher proportion of patients with a normal arteriovenous transit time of ≤ 15 s (48.39% vs. 30.77%); however, due to the limited number of cases, this difference was not significant (p = 0.133). The proportion of patients with a prolonged arteriovenous transit time (i.e. > 23 s) was lower in the CRAO without cherry-red spots group (25.81% vs. 30.77%), but the difference was not statistically significant (Table 4, p = 0.648). The median arteriovenous transit times in CRAO patients with and without cherry red spots were 18 and 19 s, respectively; this difference was not significant (Table 4, p = 0.727).

### Reversibility of retinal ischemia due to central retinal artery occlusion by hyperbaric oxygen [^114ivcca]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose

Ischemic retinal damage can be reversed by hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) as long as irreversible infarction damage has not developed. However, the time window till irreversible damage develops is still unknown. The study aim was to evaluate the effect of HBOT and determine possible markers for irreversible retinal damage.

Materials and Methods

Retrospective analysis of 225 patients treated with HBOT for central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO) in 1999–2015. One hundred and twenty-eight patients fulfilled inclusion/exclusion criteria: age > 18 years, symptoms < 20 hours, and best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) < 0.5 logMAR.

Results

Time delay from symptoms to treatment was 7.8 ± 3.8 hours. The BCVA was significantly improved after HBOT, from 2.14 ± 0.50 to 1.61 ± 0.78 (P < 0.0001). The proportion of patients with clinically meaningful visual improvement was significantly higher in patients without cherry-red spot (CRS) compared to patients with CRS at presentation (86.0% vs 57.6%, P < 0.0001). The percentage of patients with final BCVA better than 1.0 was also significantly higher in patients without CRS vs patients with CRS at presentation (61.0% vs 7.1%, P < 0.0001). There was no correlation between CRS and the time from symptoms. HBOT was found to be safe, and only 5.5% of patients had minor, reversible, adverse events.

Conclusion

HBOT is an effective treatment for non-arteritic CRAO as long as CRS has not formed. The fundus findings, rather than the time delay, should be used as a marker for irreversible damage.

### Acid ceramidase deficiency in mice leads to severe ocular pathology and visual impairment [^112zNXxa]. The American Journal of Pathology (2019). Medium credibility.

Farber disease (FD) is a debilitating lysosomal storage disorder characterized by severe inflammation and neurodegeneration. FD is caused by mutations in the ASAH1 gene, resulting in deficient acid ceramidase (ACDase) activity. Patients with ACDase deficiency exhibit a broad clinical spectrum. In classic cases, patients develop hepatosplenomegaly, nervous system involvement, and childhood mortality. Ocular manifestations include decreased vision, a grayish appearance to the retina with a cherry red spot, and nystagmus. That said, the full effect of ACDase deficiency on the visual system has not been studied in detail. We previously developed a mouse model that is orthologous for a known patient mutation in Asah1 that recapitulates human FD. Herein, we report evidence of a severe ocular pathology in Asah1 P361R/P361R mice. Asah1 P361R/P361R mice exhibit progressive retinal and optic nerve pathology. Through noninvasive ocular imaging and histopathological analyses of these Asah1 P361R/P361R animals, we revealed progressive inflammation, the presence of retinal dysplasia, and significant storage pathology in various cell types in both the retina and optic nerves. Lipidomic analyses of retinal tissues revealed an abnormal accumulation of ceramides and other sphingolipids. Electroretinograms and behavioral tests showed decreased retinal and visual responses. Taken together, these data suggest that ACDase deficiency leads to sphingolipid imbalance, inflammation, dysmorphic retinal and optic nerve pathology, and severe visual impairment.

### Central retinal artery occlusion without cherry-red spots [^113ZdNUg]. BMC Ophthalmology (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

CRAO without cherry-red spots is not rare. Patients with sudden vision loss but without cherry-red spots should be taken seriously at the first outpatient visit. Increased hyperreflectivity of the inner retina by OCT is a fast and noninvasive diagnostic examination with high specificity for CRAO. The increasing application of OCTA might be useful for the early diagnosis of CRAO without cherry-red spots.

### Tay-Sachs disease: a novel mutation from India [^1153qqcr]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

Lysosomal storage disorders or lipidoses are a wide spectrum of inherited diseases caused by deficiency of a specific lysosomal hydrolase. About 134 mutations have been described so far and this number is gradually increasing with newer mutations being reported. We report a 28-month-old child who presented to us with neurodevelopment regression, seizures and cherry red spot in both eyes. His hexosaminidase A enzyme activity was reduced and genetic testing revealed a homozygous novel variation in HEXA (hexosaminidase A) gene in the DNA sample of the patient.

### Central retinal artery occlusion in a patient with ANCA-negative Churg-Strauss syndrome [^112jDn8w]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2012). Low credibility.

Ocular involvement in Churg-Strauss syndrome is infrequent. We describe the case of a 54-year-old woman with eosinophilia and involvement of the respiratory tract, skin, and peripheral nervous system, fulfilling the American College of Rheumatology criteria for Churg-Strauss syndrome. The patient presented with acute, painless vision loss in her right eye. Central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO) without accompanying retinal vasculitis was diagnosed by angiographic findings and funduscopic findings of retinal whitening with a cherry-red spot. Although her antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) status was negative, CRAO was thought to be an ocular manifestation of Churg-Strauss syndrome, and appropriate treatment was planned. She was treated with high-dose corticosteroids and anticoagulant therapy. Her macular edema improved, but visual recovery was poor. Specific therapy to alter inflammation, blood coagulation, and rheology reportedly plays an important role in ANCA-positive patients with Churg-Strauss syndrome who develop CRAO. Regardless of ANCA status, high-dose corticosteroids should be considered for CRAO in patients with Churg-Strauss syndrome, as discussed in this case.

### A sialidosis type I cohort and a quantitative approach to multimodal ophthalmic imaging of the macular cherry-red spot [^112eJXY5]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2021). Medium credibility.

RESULTS

A summary of the ocular findings in our cohort is described in table 1.

Table 1
Summary of ocular findings among our cohort

The mean age of our cohort at their first visit was 27.5 ± 9.8 years, with a median of 29.5 years. Patients I and II were in the pediatric age group, aged 12 and 14 years old at their first visit, respectively. Four of our patients were female and four were male. Two of these eight patients were siblings (Patients III and VII) and the rest of the cohort did not have a family history of sialidosis, galactosialidosis or other lysosomal storage disease. Three patients were African American (II, V and VI) and the remaining five were Caucasian.

The mean visual acuity of our cohort was LogMar 0.4 (20/50) ± 0.4 (20/20 to 20/125) in the right (OD) and left (OS) eyes, with a median of 20/40 OD and 20/32 OS. Six patients (75%) had good visual function (20/60 or better OD and OS), Patient VIII was visually impaired (20/100 OD and OS) and Patient IV was legally blind (20/250 OD and OS). There was no significant association between age and visual acuity (linear regression, p = 0.37). Patients II, VI and VIII (37.5%) were moderate and high myopes, with spherical equivalents of −5.50 D, −6.50 D and −11.00 D, respectively. The remaining five had minor to no refractive error. Colour vision was tested in five of the eight patients and the result was normal in all of them.

### A co-occurrence of familial isolated cherry red spot and multiple lens opacities [^113eDzrb]. Eye (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose

To present a co-occurrence of familial isolated cherry red spot (CRS) and multiple lens opacities in all siblings from the same family without any other systemic or ocular diseases.

Methods

Four siblings from the same family had bilateral punctate lens opacities and bilateral CRS at the macula.

Results

The oldest one had left eye exotropia and amblyopia, otherwise the other siblings had no additional ocular findings. Systemic investigation, physical examination, and laboratory tests were within normal limits.

Conclusion

Bilateral isolated CRS along with punctate lens opacities were seen in all siblings from the same family without any systemic and ocular diseases.

### A sialidosis type I cohort and a quantitative approach to multimodal ophthalmic imaging of the macular cherry-red spot [^115tWxSa]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2021). Medium credibility.

Unlike other causes of sporadic macular cherry-red spot (such as central retinal artery occlusion) where the thickening of the macula is often present, we found patients with macular thickness values above and below the expected range and, as a group, there was no statistically significant difference between our patients and the healthy volunteers. The only significant difference between our patients and volunteers' macular OCTs was the calculated greyscale, an indicator of abnormal reflectivity of the retinal inner layers. In our patients, these values were significantly associated with RNFL thickness only. Hence, analysing the macular greyscale could be a useful tool in cases where quantitative measurements of the RNFL are not reliable or to complement them as part of the patient's evaluation, possibly detecting subtle changes.

High reflectivity was also noticed in patients with macular cherry-red spot secondary to central retinal artery occlusion. Although the pathophysiology is different, in both cases, the abnormal reflectivity may result from intracellular accumulation of liquid (oedema) or lipids within the retinal GCL. This becomes more noticeable in the perifovea due to the higher density of these cells in that area when compared to the rest of the retina and contrasts with the lack of inner retinal layers in the fovea, creating the cherry-red spot effect. By OCT, this intracellular accumulation results in higher reflectivity. The histopathological basis for these findings in sialidosis and galactosialidosis is unknown, but if they indeed relate to undigested lysosomal substrate accumulation, inner retinal reflectivity could be a sensitive and useful tool to monitor substrate burden within the retina, possibly detecting changes earlier than other structural parameters.

### Natural history of type A Niemann-Pick disease: possible endpoints for therapeutic trials [^111Eks48]. Neurology (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe the disease course and natural history of Type A Niemann-Pick disease (NPD).

Methods

Ten patients with NPD-A (six male, four female; age range at entry: 3 to 6 months) were serially evaluated including clinical neurologic, ophthalmologic, and physical examinations, and assessment of development. Laboratory analyses, abdominal and brain ultrasounds, and chest radiographs also were obtained and information on intercurrent illnesses and cause of mortality was collected.

Results

All affected infants had a normal neonatal course and early development. The first symptom detected in all patients was hepatosplenomegaly. Developmental age did not progress beyond 10 months for adaptive behavior, 12 months for expressive language, 9 months for gross motor skills, and 10 months for fine motor skills. Non-neurologic symptoms included frequent vomiting, failure to thrive, respiratory infections, irritability, and sleep disturbance. Neurologic examination at the time of presentation was normal in most patients. Later neurologic examinations revealed progressive hypotonia with loss of the deep tendon reflexes. All patients had cherry red spots by 12 months. The median time from diagnosis to death was 21 months. The cause of death was respiratory failure in nine patients and complications from bleeding in the tenth.

Conclusions

The clinical course in Type A Niemann-Pick disease is similar among affected patients and is characterized by a relentless neurodegenerative course that leads to death, usually within 3 years.

### Retinoblastoma treatment (PDQ ®)-NCI-national cancer institute… [^111cXQVa]. NCI (2025). Medium credibility.

Incidence Retinoblastoma is a relatively uncommon tumor of childhood that arises in the retina. It accounts for about 3% of the cancers occurring in children younger than 15 years. Retinoblastoma is a cancer of the very young child. Two-thirds of all cases of retinoblastoma are diagnosed before age 2 years. Thus, while the estimated annual incidence in the United States is approximately 3 cases per 1 million children younger than 20 years, the age-adjusted annual incidence in children aged 0 to 4 years is 18. 4 cases per 1 million. Anatomy Retinoblastoma arises in the retina, and it may grow under the retina and/or toward the vitreous cavity. Involvement of the ocular coats and optic nerve occurs as a sequence of events as the tumor progresses. A cystic pineal gland, which is commonly detected by surveillance MRI, needs to be distinguished from a cystic variant of pineoblastoma.

In children without retinoblastoma, the incidence of pineal cysts has been reported to be 55. 8%. In a case-control study that included 77 children with retinoblastoma and 77 controls, the incidence of pineal cysts was similar, and the size and volume of the pineal gland was not significantly different between the groups.

### Co-existence of phenylketonuria either with maple syrup urine disease or sandhoff disease in two patients from iran: emphasizing the role of consanguinity [^114vu58V]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2016). Low credibility.

Most inborn errors of metabolism (IEMs) are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. IEMs are one of the major concerns in Iran due to its extensive consanguineous marriages. Herein, we report two patients with two co-existent IEMs: a girl affected by classic phenylketonuria (PKU) and maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) and a male patient affected with Sandhoff disease and PKU, where Sandhoff disease was suspected due to the presence of a cherry-red spot in the eyes at 6 months which is unrelated to PKU. Sequencing of candidate genes in the first patient revealed one novel and three recurrent compound heterozygous mutations of p. Ser231Pro and p. Ala300Ser in the PAH gene and p. Glu330Lys and p. Arg170Cys mutations in the BCKDHB gene. Genetic testing results in the second patient showed previously reported homozygous mutations of p. Arg261Gln in the PAH and p. Arg533Cys mutation in the HEXB gene. Genetic testing confirmed the clinical diagnosis of both diseases in both patients. To the best of our knowledge; this is the first report of the co-existence of two distinct genetic disorders in two individuals from Iran. Co-existent different IEMs in patients complicated the clinical diagnosis and management of the diseases.

Follow-up

Four patients were evaluated over a mean follow-up time of 1.5 ± 0.5 years. All of them showed stable visual acuity and fundus evaluation. OCT structural parameters and reflectivity were also unchanged or with mild, non-significant variability.

Genetics, Biochemical and Systemic data

All patients had comprehensive clinical, molecular and biochemical investigations. Some of the molecular and biochemical information is described as part of a larger cohort study by Mosca et al and is the subject of an additional sialidosis type I natural history study underway (Tifft and Toro in preparation).

A detailed summary of the ophthalmological characteristics of our cohort is described in table 3.

### Central retinal artery occlusion: a stroke of the eye [^115P2tT4]. Eye (2024). Medium credibility.

Risk factors for RAOs are similar to ischaemic cerebral stroke and myocardial infarctions, and include: advanced age (over 60), male gender, cardiovascular disease and smoking. A significant proportion of CRAO patients have undiagnosed cardiovascular disease risk factors at time of presentation. Callizo et al. found 78% of CRAO patients had at least one newly identified risk factor after diagnosis. Furthermore, CRAO maybe a precursor for stroke, with 13% of patients included in this study having a subsequent stroke; with just under half experiencing this within 4 weeks of CRAO onset.

In the setting of an acute event, the following findings are most commonly seen on fundus examination: a cherry-red spot (90%), retinal opacity in the posterior pole (58%), disc pallor (39%), retinal artery attenuation (32%), disc oedema (22%) and box-carring (19%) (Fig. 1B, C). At the advanced stage of disease, optic atrophy, retinal artery attenuation and cilioretinal collaterals were the three most frequently noted fundus findings. Intra-arterial emboli are seen in around 20% of fundi examinations; the three most frequent emboli are cholesterol, calcium and platelet-fibrin. Visual field defects in patients suffering a CRAO usually result in a central/centrocaecal scotomas (19%) and temporal island (59%) defects. Those with a cilioretinal sparing CRAO may have preserved central area but peripheral visual field loss. Positive prognostic indicators of visual field improvement are mild CRAO stages, a good baseline visual acuity, mild retinal changes and less severe visual field defects at time of presentation.

Paracentral acute middle maculopathy (PAMM) has been defined with the presence of a hyperreflective parafoveal band at the level of the inner nuclear layer (INL) on spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) (Fig. 3). PAMM is commonly associated with CRAO. This clinical entity has been shown to be associated with several retinal vascular diseases is postulated to be due to localised ischaemia of the intermediate plexus secondary to an underlying ischaemic insult such as CRAO.

### Neuroprotection for nonarteritic central retinal artery occlusion: lessons from acute ischemic stroke [^117DBz4z]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2023). Medium credibility.

Multiple researchers have shown that lowering the retina's temperature to between 4–8 degrees by cooling the infusion fluid during vitrectomy increases retinal resistance and decreases retinal damage. However, research has yet to conclude how much lowering is safe for the retina. One study suggests that moderate hypothermia to 22 degrees was safe in rabbit eyes. Furthermore, induced localized retinal hypothermia has increased retinal survival time to 12 hours at 21 degrees and up to 50 hours at 4 degrees. The mechanism for hypothermic neuroprotection may be related to decreased energy requirements.
2. **Hyperbaric Oxygen (HBO)**: Clinical trials on Hyperbaric oxygen HBO for CRAO have shown mixed results, but there are several reports of success with functional improvement if HBO is administered within the specified time frame. Likely, HBO is also affected by the same multifactorial determinants in CRAO that affect the treatment outcome on a case-by-case basis. HBO maintains retinal oxygenation during CRAO by allowing oxygen to diffuse through choroidal capillaries exposed to elevated partial pressures of oxygen, thereby reversing the effects of ischemia. Sunny et al recently reporting on sixty patients treated with HBO after CRAO; 65% had an improved vision with a mean of 8.6 ± 3.2 treatment sessions. Barotrauma was a significant complication of this treatment in 20% of patients. Hadanny et al reported similar improvements in vision in one hundred and twenty-eight CRAO patients. They observed that the proportion of patients with clinically meaningful improvement in vision was higher in patients without cherry-red spot compared to patients with cherry red spot. They found no correlation between cherry-red spot and time to symptom and only 5.5% of patients experience minor adverse events. In another study, patients who had HBO as part of treatment for NACRAO were compared with patients who had no HBO. The HBO group had significant improvements in vision while the no HBO group had no improvements in vision.

### Central retinal artery occlusion-rethinking retinal survival time [^117SBDsa]. BMC Ophthalmology (2018). Low credibility.

Methods

Medline was systematically searched using the terms "retinal stroke", "central retinal artery occlusion", "retinal infarction", "retinal ischemia", and "cherry red spot" from 1970 to the present including articles in English, French, and German literature. These terms were connected with "or". An Internet search using these search terms was also performed to look for additional references with no year restriction. All retrieved references as well as their reference lists were screened for evidence relevant to determination of the time to infarction of complete CRAO as well as articles relevant to the physiology of retinal stroke.

Eligible criteria

All publications obtained from Internet-based searches were screened by the above predefined selection criteria. Eligible studies were all studies reporting on the time to retinal infarction from complete CRAO as well as articles relevant to the physiology of retinal stroke. Two reviewers (S.T. and S.J) completed the assessment of search results to identify included studies.

### Retinal and ophthalmic artery occlusions preferred practice pattern ® [^114Pcng7]. Ophthalmology (2025). High credibility.

Central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO) — typical clinical presentation — features a "sudden, painless decrease in the visual acuity and field of vision in one eye that occurs over a period of seconds", with bilateral occurrence "in 1% to 2% of cases", which "should raise the suspicion of a vasculitic process, such as GCA". Early findings can include "a deep retinal whitening… with an inner nuclear layer of hyper-reflectivity on optical coherence tomography (OCT)" and the classic cherry red spot, which "typically presents within several hours of onset", reflecting retinal whitening from "opacification of the swollen, ischemic parafoveal nerve fiber layers".

### Sialidosis type 1 without cherry-red spots: a case report and literature review [^114e6RYs]. BMJ Neurology Open (2024). High credibility.

Discussion

Since the first report of sialidosis by Guazzi et al in 1968, it has been identified as a specific neurological disorder. It was later confirmed that this group of autosomal recessive genetic diseases is caused by mutations in the NEU1 gene. This mutation leads to a deficiency in neuraminidase, an enzyme that plays a critical role in removing terminal sialic acid molecules from oligosaccharides and glycoproteins. This deficiency results in the storage of large molecules rich in sialic acid and excretion of sialic oligosaccharides in urine, leading to a buildup of sialic acid and a series of clinical symptoms. According to these symptoms, sialidosis can be classified into types I and II. Type I is characterised by late-onset (10–20 years old) progressive visual impairment, cherry-red spots in the fundus, myoclonic epilepsy and cerebellar ataxia. On the other hand, type II features morphological traits such as facial coarseness, short trunk, barrel-shaped chest, spinal deformities and skeletal dysplasia, and may sometimes be accompanied by corneal clouding, hepatomegaly and inner ear hearing loss. The onset of type II is earlier, with early death. This metabolic disorder exhibits characteristic manifestations in the macula, such as the appearance of 'cherry-red spots', which could potentially lead to ganglion degeneration and significant late-stage visual impairment. However, these cherry-red spots may not be detected in clinical examinations for many years and may disappear in the late stages of the disease. Studies by Kivlin et al suggest that these spots may appear early and disappear later, while Qun Wang et al summarise that these spots could disappear as the disease progresses or appear 20 years after onset. Given the presence of cherry-red spots in the fundus, type I sialidosis is also known as cherry-red spot myoclonus syndrome. However, Bou Ghannam AS et al reported a case where no cherry-red spots were observed in the fundus. Likewise, Coppola et al observed patients for as long as 30 years and found no cherry-red spots in the fundus. Therefore, while cherry-red spots may appear in type I sialidosis, using it to name the disease is imprecise and may mislead clinicians in making early diagnoses.

### Extended phenotypic spectrum of benign yellow dot maculopathy [^111ivJEZ]. Eye (2025). Medium credibility.

Summary

What was known before

Benign yellow dot maculopathy has recently been recognized as a specific entity.
Patients are usually asymptomatic and retinal function is usually normal.
Vertical transmission has been observed in families of some patients.

What this study adds

The prevalence of benign yellow dot maculopathy is possibly higher than previously assumed.
The extend of retinal involvement is very variable, resulting in a wide spectrum of phenotypic presentation.
The yellow dots appear dark on near-infrared autofluorescence imaging, possibly indicating a developmental focal lack of melanin in retinal pigment epithelial cells.

### Vision screening for infants and children-2022 [^112qpVCF]. AAO (2022). High credibility.

Vision screening for infants and children — many serious ocular conditions are treatable if identified through screening during the preschool and early school-aged years, and many of these conditions are associated with a positive family history. Therefore, additional emphasis should be directed to screening high-risk infants and children, and, when necessary, screeners should readily refer such children to an ophthalmologist for a comprehensive eye evaluation.

### Retinal and ophthalmic artery occlusions preferred practice pattern ® [^112Sbni5]. Ophthalmology (2025). High credibility.

Ophthalmic artery occlusion (OAO) — anatomic location, clinical signs, and angiographic findings: Ophthalmic artery occlusions are usually located proximal to both the branch point of the general posterior ciliary arteries (choroidal supply) and central retinal artery (retinal supply), and in a patient with an OAO, the central retinal artery and ciliary arteries that supply blood flow to the choroid are obstructed, and vision is profoundly reduced. On funduscopic examination, a cherry red spot may not be detected because both the choroid and the retinal circulations are ischemic, with little vascular flow to the entire retina, including the foveal region; when the circulation of the optic disc is involved, there may be optic disc edema. A fluorescein angiogram will help demonstrate both retinal vascular occlusion as well as broad areas of choroidal nonperfusion, and a dark ring of both choroidal and retinal nonperfusion may be seen surrounding the optic nerve in OAO with lobular or triangular areas of patchy choroidal nonperfusion; the posterior pole or peripheral areas of triangular ischemia, also referred to as Amalric's triangle, is a reflection of the choroidal vascular flow distribution.

A screening eye examination is an essential part of the newborn assessment. The detection of many ocular disorders in newborn infants can be achieved through careful observation of the infant's visual behaviour and the use of a direct ophthalmoscope to assess the ocular structures and check the red reflex. Early diagnosis and subspecialty referral can have a critical impact on the prognosis for many ocular conditions, including potentially blinding but treatable conditions such as congenital cataracts, life-threatening malignancies such as retinoblastoma and harbingers of disease elsewhere such as sporadic aniridia and its association with the development of Wilms tumour.

### A sialidosis type I cohort and a quantitative approach to multimodal ophthalmic imaging of the macular cherry-red spot [^1139pNWr]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2021). Medium credibility.

Regarding structural parameters, the mean macular volume of our cohort (9.95 ± 1.02 mm 3) was mildly below what was reported on a healthy population (10.01 ± 0.02 mm 3). The mean central foveal thickness (263.5 ± 22 μm), however, was moderately above the normal limits (255.4 ± 0.9 μm). Five patients were above this limit on both eyes and the remaining three (Patients IV, VI and VIII) were below on at least one eye. Similarly, the mean thickness of the midperipheral ring area (325 ± 33 μm) was moderately greater than the one described in the normal population (316.5 ± 0.6 μm), Patients IV, VI and VIII had values below the normal limit on at least one eye and the remaining five had appropriate thickness. Patients IV and VIII were also the only ones presenting with decreased RNFL thickness, below the normally reported among adults (99.4 ± 9.7 μm). Interestingly, the two children (Patients I and II) had a mean RNFL (93 μm) that corresponds to the 5th percentile of their age group (normal RNFL thickness in children: 109 ± 15.5 μm). We did not find an association between age and any parameter on our patients' evaluation (visual acuity, RNFL thickness, macular volume, macular thickness, reflectivity of the inner retinal layers). Likewise, all patients presented with clear corneas and non-visually significant changes in the lens, even at an older age. Therefore, we do not find that age itself is responsible for their acuity loss.

### Central retinal artery occlusion without cherry-red spots [^116af72b]. BMC Ophthalmology (2023). Medium credibility.

How to quickly and accurately diagnose patients with sudden vision loss who present without cherry-red spots at the first visit has become an urgent problem. Although FA is currently still the gold standard for diagnosing CRAO, the invasive and time-consuming nature of FA often delays the treatment of CRAO. In this study, we found that patients without cherry-red spots had a higher number of cases with normal arteriovenous transit time (< 15 s) and a lower number of cases with delayed arteriovenous transit time (> 23 s). However, due to the limited number of cases, there was no statistically significant difference compared to the patients with cherry-red spots. The proportion of delayed arteriovenous transit time in patients without cherry-red spots was 25.81%. Therefore, FA cannot be the preferred examination for diagnosing CRAO in patients without cherry-red spots.

In the present study, only 3 of the CRAO patients did not show increased hyperreflectivity of the inner retina on OCT, and they presented without cherry-red spots at the first visit. The incidence of increased hyperreflectivity of the inner retina in patients without cherry-red spots was 90.33%. Therefore, OCT is recommended as the preferred examination for diagnosing CRAO in patients without cherry-red spots. The reasons why these CRAO patients presented without increased hyperreflectivity of the inner retina and cherry-red spot might be obvious in the very early stage after retinal infarction, incomplete occlusion, presence of ciliary retinal blood supply, or recanalization after occlusion. We should be particularly cautious about these patients, and ocular coherence tomography angiography (OCTA), FA, or electrophysiological examinations should be performed to comprehensively evaluate the condition. OCTA is a noninvasive examination that can display the blood flow of the retina. Clear OCTA images were obtained in a few CRAO patients due to difficult fixation and long acquisition time. It was found that OCTA displayed disruption of the superficial and deep retinal capillary plexus in the early stage of CRAO. Retinal capillary plexus changes on OCTA appear earlier than increased hyperreflectivity of the inner retina on OCT. However, most patients with CRAO have poor vision and have difficulty in fixation, which can affect the image quality of OCTA.

### A sialidosis type I cohort and a quantitative approach to multimodal ophthalmic imaging of the macular cherry-red spot [^1172cND6]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2021). Medium credibility.

There are several cases of sialidosis type I in the literature where the cherry-red spot was not clear resulting in a delayed diagnosis. Bou Ghannam et al reported a patient without macular cherry-red spot but with thickened OCT and hyperautofluorescence perifoveally. Analysing only macular thickness can lead us to false negatives due to this parameter being altered by the patients' refraction. Evaluating the greyscale of the macular OCT can be particularly useful when the prototypical sign is not clinically evident.

Since our observations include only cross-sectional data, short follow-up interval and patients with a heterogeneous combination of pathogenic alleles on a diverse genetic background, we cannot rule out the possibility that longitudinal natural history of the retinal thickness could follow a 'biphasic' pattern with thickening and increased reflectivity early in the disease followed, over time, by progressive retinal GCL degeneration with reduced greyscale values, eventual retinal thinning, optic atrophy and decreased visual acuity as found in our most visually affected cases. This line of inquiry can be formally explored on existing animal models of sialidosis such as the one described by d'Azzo et al and Bonten et al.

When considering ophthalmological findings in sialidosis as possible outcome measures for future disease-modifying interventional clinical trials, we believe monitoring structural OCT findings as well as macular greyscale parameters to be valuable. Most of our patients presented with good visual acuity, and age was not associated with decreased vision. Quantifying macular OCTs' reflectivity can be particularly useful in patients with lysosomal storage disorders, especially in cases where the cherry-red spot is not clear.

### Sialidosis type 1 without cherry-red spots: a case report and literature review [^113AG8Zj]. BMJ Neurology Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Sialidosis is a group of rare autosomal recessive genetic disorders caused by mutations in the NEU1 gene located on chromosome 6p21.31. This disease is categorised into types I and II, with type I characterised mainly by late-onset (10–20 years) progressive visual impairment, cherry-red spot in the retina, myoclonic epilepsy and cerebellar ataxia. However, the rarity and diversity of this disease pose challenges in understanding and identifying it.

Diagnosing sialidosis typically requires enzyme activity analysis, electron microscopy examination and genetic testing, which may not be readily accessible, especially in resource-limited settings. Additionally, the symptoms of this disease can resemble those of more common conditions, potentially leading to misdiagnosis as other diseases, such as psychiatric disorders, and consequently delayed diagnosis. The cherry-red spot in the retina is a hallmark of sialidosis type I and was once referred to as the cherry-red spot myoclonus syndrome. However, previous case reports suggest that not all patients with sialidosis type I present with a cherry-red spot. This observation may carry significant clinical implications for the diagnosis and understanding of the disease, as overemphasis on the cherry-red spot could mislead clinicians and delay diagnosis.

### Central retinal artery occlusion without cherry-red spots [^112VmEPg]. BMC Ophthalmology (2023). Medium credibility.

This study analysed possible reasons for the absence of cherry-red spots in CRAO and explored recommended examinations when CRAO is suspected without cherry-red spots. The limitation of this study is that it includes all types of CRAO, and different subtypes of CRAO might have different manifestations. Second, this study only obtained clear OCTA images in a minority of CRAO patients. OCTA can be used to detect early signs of retinal ischaemia, and the combination of OCT and OCTA is worth further research in the early diagnosis of CRAO without cherry red dots.

### Central retinal artery occlusion resembling purtscher-like retinopathy [^115cy4xv]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2011). Low credibility.

This paper reports three cases of central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO) with Purtscher-like retinopathy and good recovery of visual function. The three cases of CRAO had similar fundus changes, ie, cotton wool patches surrounding the optic disc and whitening of the retina surrounding the fovea with a cherry red spot. Fluorescein angiography showed a delay of arm-to-retina circulation time and a partial defect of choroid circulation. Although the three cases were treated by different regimens of steroid pulse therapy and antiplatelet therapy, visual function recovered well and all disturbances of the retinal and choroid circulations resolved. Although eyes with a CRAO normally have a poor visual prognosis, our three cases responded well to the treatments and recovered good visual function. Thus, cases showing fundus changes similar to our three cases may have a pathogenesis different from that of a complete CRAO.

### A sialidosis type I cohort and a quantitative approach to multimodal ophthalmic imaging of the macular cherry-red spot [^1141nyCg]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2021). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Sialidosis or mucolipidosis I (OMIM# 256550) and galactosialidosis (GS, OMIM # 256540) are two related disorders belonging to the glycoproteinosis subgroup of over 70 other lysosomal storage diseases. Sialidosis is a recessive disease resulting from mutations in the NEU1 gene, which encodes neuraminidase 1 (NEU1). This enzyme hydrolyses the sialic acid residue of glycoproteins and glycolipids, as part of the lysosomal role of degradation of complex macromolecules. There are two defined clinical phenotypes. Sialidosis type I, often referred to as 'myoclonus-cherry-red spot syndrome', is a less severe disorder, usually presenting in the second decade of life with myoclonus, seizures, ataxia and visual decline. Sialidosis type II, a more severe, early-onset form of the disease (congenital or infantile) runs a more acute and often fulminant course.

Galactosialidosis is a related recessive disorder caused by mutations in CTSA gene, which encodes the protective protein cathepsin A (PPCA).PPCA forms a stable tri-protein complex with NEU1 and beta-galactosidase (β-GAL). Primary PPCA deficiency leads to a secondary, combined deficiency of NEU1 and β-GAL. Galactosialidosis has three clinical phenotypes: early infantile, late infantile and juvenile/adult. The latter is the most common and may include coarse facies, skeletal anomalies, myoclonus, cherry-red macula and seizures.

A macular cherry-red spot is a well-known feature of sialidosis, galactosialidosis and other lysosomal storage disorders such as infantile Tay-Sachs, Nieman-Pick and Sandhoff diseases. However, its relevance to patients' visual acuity and its association with age, disease duration and prognosis for future visual function are uncertain. The purpose of this study is to provide a detailed description of the ophthalmologic findings in the largest cohort of patients with sialidosis type I to date. In addition, we report on one patient who initially presented as 'myoclonus-cherry-red spot syndrome' who was subsequently molecularly diagnosed with galactosialidosis. We expand on the characterisation of the prototypical features of the 'cherry-red spot macula' by providing comprehensive quantitative and multimodal imaging analyses.

### A sialidosis type I cohort and a quantitative approach to multimodal ophthalmic imaging of the macular cherry-red spot [^1133SuRL]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2021). Medium credibility.

Aim

To describe the ophthalmologic findings on the largest cohort of patients with sialidosis type I due to deficiency of the lysosomal sialidase, neuraminidase 1 (NEU1) and to introduce a quantitative neuroretinal image analysis approach to the associated 'macular cherry-red spot'.

Methods

Seven patients with sialidosis type I (mutations in NEU1) and one with galactosialidosis (mutations in CTSA) were included. All patients underwent detailed ophthalmological examinations. The reflectivity of macular optical coherence tomography (OCT) was measured using greyscale analysis (Fiji) and compared with age-matched healthy volunteers. Four patients were evaluated over a time of 1.5+0.5 years.

Results

The mean age of the patients at their first visit was 27.5+9.8 years. All patients had a macular cherry-red spot, clear corneas and visually non-significant lenticular opacities. The mean visual acuity was LogMar 0.4 (20/50)+0.4 (20/20 to 20/125). Six patients had good visual function. Optic atrophy was present in two individuals with reduced acuity. A significant increase in macular reflectivity was present in all patients compared to age-matched controls (p < 0.0001).

Conclusion

Most of our patients (75%) have preserved visual acuity, even in adulthood. The presence of optic atrophy is associated with poor visual acuity. Increased macular reflectivity by OCT greyscale measurements is noted in all patients, although the underlying biological basis is unknown. These findings complement the current methods for examining and monitoring disease progression, especially in patients for whom visualisation of the cherry-red spot is not entirely clear.

Results

Demographics

Seventy patients (seventy eyes) were included in the present study. The median age was 61 years old, ranging from 19 to 83. The study included 48 males (68.6%) and 22 females (31.4%). All CRAO patients had visual acuity lower than 20/200, 11 patients (15.71%) had visual acuity between 20/2000 and 20/200, 59 patients (84.29%) had visual acuity lower than 20/2000, and 5 patients (7.14%) had no light perception. The time from initiation of symptoms to the first outpatient visit ranged from 1 h to 7 days with a medium time of 3 days, of which 6 patients (8.57%) had outpatient visits that were shorter than 4 h. Most CRAO patients had systemic diseases, with 41 cases (58.57%) of hypertension, 11 cases (15.71%) of diabetes, 4 cases (5.71%) of cerebral infarction, and 3 cases (4.29%) of coronary heart disease.

Fundus characteristics of CRAO

In the present study, fundus changes in CRAO were located in the posterior retina, with a comparatively normal peripheral retina. Fundus characteristics, including posterior retinal whitening, cherry-red spots, optic disc oedema, haemorrhage, leopard-shaped fundus, cotton-wool spots and ciliary retinal artery perfusion, were recorded and analysed. The fundus characteristics of patients with CRAO are shown in Table 1. The three most common fundus characteristics were posterior retinal whitening (81.43%), cherry-red spots (55.71%), and optic disc oedema (37.14%). Seven patients (10%) had ciliary retinal artery perfusion.

### Sickle cell disease presenting with extensive peri-macular arteriolar occlusions in a nine-year-old boy [^117QB5DZ]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2001). Low credibility.

Purpose

To report a dramatic occlusive event of the macula surrounding the foveal avascular zone, causing severe and permanent loss of vision in a child with sickle cell disease.

Methods

Case report. A nine-year-old boy with SS hemoglobinopathy and oculocutaneous albinism developed acute unilateral loss of vision.

Results

Ophthalmoscopy revealed a pale, milky white, thickened retinal lesion centered on the fovea in the right eye as well as foveal hypoplasia in the left eye. The presence of macular malformation associated with oculocutaneous albinism precluded formation of a cherry-red spot. Fluorescein angiography of the right eye demonstrated extensive occlusions of the arterioles surrounding the foveal avascular zone. The presence of occlusions surrounding the fovea from multiple directions suggested the possibility of central retinal artery occlusion with migration of microemboli downstream.

Conclusion

The patient, the youngest case reported, developed an irreversible macular infarction that was not improved by an exchange erythrocyte transfusion. He was placed on a long-term monthly transfusion protocol to protect his unaffected eye.

Visual stroke syndromes

The physician can use knowledge of these anatomical landmarks and their corresponding blood supply to clinically localise a stroke involving vision by recognising effects of their dysfunction on the clinical examination.

Monocular visual loss due to prechiasmal ischaemia

Prechiasmal vision loss can be caused by retinal ischaemia secondary to occlusion within the ophthalmic artery vascular supply. Preceding symptoms of non-visual strokes often include TMVL. Over 75% of these patients experience associated decreased visual acuity. Lavallée et al conducted a prospective cohort study and concluded that ischaemia was the causative factor in 93.3% of transient ischaemic attack (TIA) clinic patients presenting with TMVL.

Retinal ischaemia can occur either transiently as amaurosis fugax (AF) or permanently due to branch retinal artery occlusion (BRAO), central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO), or rarely ophthalmic artery occlusion. Any of these can result in permanent vision loss with decreased visual acuity or visual field deficits.CRAO can be recognised by visualisation of the pathognomonic 'cherry red spot' in the macula (figure 2).

Figure 2
Fundus photo of central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO). CRAO results in generalised retinal oedema, sparing the optic nerve, which is supported by a separate blood supply. Examination shows a 'cherry red spot' (arrow). The cherry red spot is an optical illusion. The macula is not more red; the oedema of the nerve fibres surrounding it colours it pallid, causing the macula, which has relatively less nerve fibres and therefore less tissue to swell, to appear relatively red.

Retinal ischaemia is included in the definition of TIA, according to The American Heart Association/American Stroke Association guidelines. The 5-year incidence of retinal emboli is 0.9% and the prevalence is 1.3%, according to the Beaver Dam Eye Study (BDES), a large population cohort study of 4926 patients. The BDES found that asymptomatic patients with retinal emboli experienced an increased risk of stroke-related death (Hazard Ratio (HR) = 2.61, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 1.12 to 6.08) compared with those without retinal emboli. Lauda et al performed a retrospective study and concluded that acute brain infarction occurred in 23% of 213 patients with CRAO or BRAO, a significant finding given that vision loss was the only presenting symptom in 90% of these patients.

### Central retinal artery occlusion without cherry-red spots [^1128q5Tp]. BMC Ophthalmology (2023). Medium credibility.

The present study showed that the most common cause of CRAO without cherry-red spots is a leopard-shaped fundus (32.26%). In addition, venous obstruction, the lack of obvious inner retinal coagulative necrosis, ciliary retinal artery sparing, high macular oedema, and cherry-red spot enlargement could also lead to the absence of cherry-red spots. Due to the limited number of CRAO patients, it was not possible to identify all the potential reasons for the absence of cherry-red spots. Based on the mechanism of cherry-red spots, we inferred that the following circumstances that affect the contrast between the macula and posterior retina could cause the absence of cherry-red spots in CRAO patients: ① abnormalities in choroidal blood vessels include leopard-like fundus due to choroidal atrophy in high myopia patients (Fig. 1 A) and elderly patients and choroidal ischaemia caused by occlusion of the ophthalmic artery or ciliary retinal artery; ② abnormalities in the pigment epithelium of the macula, such as pathological myopia, age-related macular degeneration, and Stargardt's disease; ③ the thickness of the retina becomes thinner, which can be seen in patients with retinitis pigmentosa, advanced age, and late-stage glaucoma; ④ insufficient oedema or opacity of the inner retina (when patients came to the clinic shortly after retinal infarction or the central retinal artery was partially blocked, the inner retina had less obvious oedema, as seen in Fig. 1 B); ⑤ various macular changes, such as macular haemorrhage, exudation, and oedema, can obscure the colour of the choroid (Fig. 1 C, E, F); and ⑥ the macula is supplied by the ciliary retinal artery when the central retina is infarcted (Fig. 1 D).

### Bilateral sequential ocular vascular occlusions with subsequent unilateral acute retinal necrosis in a patient with HIV infection [^1147J79b]. Journal of Vitreoretinal Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose: To report a case of bilateral ocular vascular occlusion with subsequent development of unilateral acute retinal necrosis in a patient with HIV infection. Methods: A single case was evaluated. Results: A 40-year-old woman presented with a sudden decrease in vision in the right eye for a 1-month duration. Disc pallor, arteriolar attenuation, and blot hemorrhages were seen in the midperiphery of the fundus of the right eye. On follow-up, the patient presented with reduced vision in the left eye for a 10-day duration. A fundus examination of the right eye showed extensive retinitis patches, and a cherry-red spot, boxcarring, and multiple sclerosed arterioles were seen in the left eye. The patient was later found to be positive for HIV infection but had never started therapy. Conclusions: A sequential progression from the occlusive event to retinitis should be kept in mind to customize follow-up for patients with HIV infection.

### Central retinal artery occlusion following severe blow-out fracture in young adult [^114tVRAG]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2009). Low credibility.

A 20-year-old woman was involved in a traffic accident while riding a motorcycle. The vision in her right eye was severely reduced. At the first examination, the eyelids of her right eye were severely swollen, and the eye could barely be seen. The fundus was not visible. She had no light perception in her vision. Computed tomography revealed a severe blow-out fracture in her right eye. Surgery was immediately performed to correct the fracture and the eye globe was replaced in the orbit. On the fourth postoperative day, the right fundus was visible and a cherry-red spot and milky-white edema were seen. Fluorescein angiography showed an arterial filling defect. Four months later, her visual acuity was light perception. Our case shows that a central retinal artery occlusion can be a complication of a blow-out fracture of the lower orbital wall and can lead to severe visual loss even with early surgical repair.

### Central retinal artery occlusion fromendocarditis [^116Rc7U5]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

Central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO) is a rare but blinding disorder. We present a case of a 81-year-old woman with multiple cardiovascular comorbidities admitted to the emergency department due to sudden, painless vision loss on left eye (oculus sinister (OS)) on awakening. The patient also reported long standing fatigue associated with effort that started 4months before admission. She presented best corrected visual acuity of counting fingers OS. Funduscopy OS revealed macular oedema with cherry red spot pattern. Blood cultures came positive for Streptococcus gallolyticus in the context of a bacteremia and native mitral valve vegetation identified on transoesophageal echocardiography. CRAO of embolic origin was admitted in the context of an infective endocarditis. CRAO can be the first manifestation of a potentially fatal systemic condition and thus multidisciplinary approach is warranted with close collaboration between ophthalmologists and internists in order to provide proper management and the best possible treatment.

### Central retinal artery occlusion without cherry-red spots [^111Mrs1c]. BMC Ophthalmology (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

CRAO is usually diagnosed based on the patient's history and based on clinical findings of typical cherry-red spots. However, cherry-red spots are not a unique manifestation of CRAO. Various diseases that cause retinal opacity could also have cherry-red spots. In addition, some cases of CRAO may present without cherry-red spots, which makes the diagnosis challenging. The critical time from onset of artery occlusion to functionally significant inner retinal infarction represents a window for treatment and therapeutic interventions. The retina of monkeys can tolerate ischaemia for approximately 100 min without significant histological changes. Irreversible retinal damage occurs 240 min after infarction. Currently, the optimal treatment time window for CRAO is widely believed to be 240 min. This study aimed to improve the diagnostic rate of CRAO at the first visit and gain valuable time for subsequent intervention.

A previous study by Hayreh et al. revealed that cherry-red spots were present in 90% of patients with permanent CRAO, while posterior retina opacity accounted for 58%, and optic disc oedema accounted for 22%. Marwa et al. reported that cherry-red spots were present in 66.7% of CRAO patients. The present study showed that posterior retina opacity was the most common ocular finding (81.43%), while cherry-red spots were present in 55.71% of CRAO patients. The reasons for the inconsistent incidence of cherry-red spots in CRAO patients were as follows: (1) The present study included CRAO with cilioretinal artery sparing. This subtype of CRAO was associated with a lower incidence of macular abnormalities. (2) In this study, the incidence of patients who presented with cherry-red spots at the first outpatient visit was calculated, while the incidence of cherry-red spots was obtained in the first week of presentation in Hayreh's study.

### Severe visual loss caused by ocular perforation during chalazion removal [^112Zj2fU]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose

To report two cases of ocular perforation during chalazion removal procedures leading to severe vision loss.

Design

Observational case series.

Methods

Two patients presented with unilateral decreased vision after chalazion removal procedures. Complete ophthalmologic examinations were performed.

Results

Examination revealed a cherry red spot and perforation site in the first patient. In the second patient, there was an intraocular gas bubble and ischemic retina.

Conclusions

Local anesthetic injections for procedures such as chalazia removal can result in ocular perforation. We postulate that the intraocular injections led to extremely high pressures, compromising the blood supply to the retina and optic nerve. Anesthetic injections for all procedures, even chalazia removal, should be done with great caution. It is imperative to avoid injection if ocular perforation is suspected, as the high pressure may cause the majority of the visual morbidity.

### Fundus autofluorescence and optical coherence tomography of a macular cherry-red spot in a case report of sialidosis [^1176MQww]. BMC Ophthalmology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Sialidosis is a rare lysosomal storage disorder characterized by deficiency of alpha-N-acetyl neuraminidase. The macular cherry-red spot, which could be important for diagnosis, is a distinctive feature of its ocular manifestation. We evaluated the fundus autofluorescence (FAF) and optical coherence tomography (OCT) images of a juvenile patient who presented with vision decrease and was later confirmed with genetic sialidosis.

Case Presentation

A 13-year-old Chinese male presented with bilateral decreased vision over the past 2 years before his initial visit. Funduscopic examination revealed a macular cherry-red bilateral spot. FAF showed hyperreflective areas surrounding a central hyporeflective fovea in both eyes. OCT revealed increased reflectivity in the ganglion cell layer in both maculae without a definite boundary between the hyperreflective and normal areas. These findings suggested that lipofuscin had accumulated in the retinal ganglion cells, which is a distinctive ocular feature in metabolic central nervous system (CNS) disorders. He was later confirmed with genetic sialidosis.

Conclusions

FAF and OCT images are very sensitive and useful techniques for diagnosing lysosomal storage disease of the CNS, and are helpful in evaluating the extent of damage in retinal ganglion cells.

### Sudden unilateral visual loss after autologous fat injection into the nasolabial fold [^11745vhx]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2008). Low credibility.

A 27-year-old female presented with sudden visual loss of her right eye after receiving an autologous fat injection into the right nasolabial fold. Fundus examination of the right eye showed multiple whitish patchy lesions with macular edema. Fluorescein angiogram showed deterioration of choroidal circulation with patchy choroidal filling and arm-to-retina circulation time and retinal arteriovenous passage time were delayed to 30 seconds and 20 seconds, respectively. There was no response in flash visual evoked potential (VEP). High dose steroid therapy (methylprednisolone 1 g/day/i.v.) was done and about 2 weeks later, the disc edema subsided and retinal arteriovenous passage time of fluorescein angiogram was normalized but there was no improvement in visual acuity. Absence of a cherry red spot, deterioration of choroidal circulation with patchy choroidal fillings seen in fluorescein angiogram, and no response in flash VEP suggests multiple choroidal infarction due to perfusion defect of the short posterior ciliary artery. The autologous fat injected is thought to have entered the dorsal nasal artery and the retrograde migration of the emboli to the ophthalmic artery might have caused the multiple occlusions of the short posterior ciliary artery.

Fig. 4
Variants identified in this study and main diagnosed diseases.

A Unique P/LP variants identified in this study (loss of function (LoF), copy number variants (CNVs)). B Most frequent diseases diagnosed in this cohort.

In some cases, the genetic diagnosis was based on the detection of a SNV and a CNV affecting the same gene. For example, in a 3-month-old male index with seizures, body odor, hyperisoleucinemia, hyperleucinemia, and hypervalinemia, we identified a heterozygous likely pathogenic frameshift variant and a heterozygous likely pathogenic deletion of exons 2–3 of the DBT gene. This, together with the specific clinical presentation strongly suggests the diagnosis of autosomal recessive maple syrup urine disease type II. Indeed, further carrier testing in the parents confirmed the trans phase of the alleles. In addition, a 2-year-old male index presenting with abdominal distention and splenomegaly had a heterozygous pathogenic missense variant and a heterozygous pathogenic deletion of exons 8–10 of the GBA gene. The activity of beta-glucocerebrosidase was extremely low, and the biomarker lyso-Gb1 was pathologically increased — establishing the diagnosis of Gaucher disease. The last patient of this group was a 1-year-old male that presented with global developmental delay, hepatosplenomegaly, cherry red spot of the macula, and hyperammonemia. We identified a pathogenic heterozygous deletion encompassing exons 1 to 17, and a pathogenic hemizygous frameshift variant, both affecting the GLB1 gene. In addition, the activity of beta-galactosidase was pathologically reduced, confirming the genetic diagnosis of GM1-gangliosidosis type I.

### Correction-spontaneous central retinal artery occlusion in hemoglobin SC disease (1) [^113Pzy23]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2000). Low credibility.

PURPOSE: To describe a case of spontaneous central retinal artery occlusion in a young man with hemoglobin sickle cell disease.METHOD: Case report.RESULTS: A 31-year-old African-American man with a history of hemoglobin SC (sickle C) disease developed sudden painless loss of vision in the right eye. Medical history was remarkable for the recent history of a mild sickle crisis, but no other systemic illness or contributing factors. Central retinal artery occlusion was diagnosed with retinal whitening, cherry red spot, and delayed arteriovenous transit on fluorescein angiography. Over the ensuing week, the patient had visual recovery to 20/60 in the absence of therapeutic intervention.CONCLUSION: Central retinal artery occlusion has been reported in sickle cell hemoglobinopathies (ie, SS, S-thal, sickle trait, and SC), but the association with double heterozygous SC disease is rare. Most reports have described additional contributing factors, such as trauma or concomitant systemic illness, to help account for the central retinal artery occlusion. The present case suggests that SC disease alone is sufficient for the development of central retinal artery occlusion.

Reasons for CRAO without cherry-red spots

Cherry-red spots were present in 39 eyes (55.71%). The reasons for CRAO without typical cherry-red spots are shown in Table 2. Various diseases that have leopard print fundus are the primary reason for CRAO without cherry red spots, which accounts for 32.26% of the reasons. In Fig. 1 A, one CRAO patient with leopard print fundus due to high myopia did not show typical cherry red spots. In this case, the choroid was significantly thinner than normal (indicated by the yellow arrow) due to atrophy of the small vessel layer. The inner retina showed high reflection and obvious oedema. Eight cases (25.81%) of CRAO combined with retinal vein occlusion (RVO) did not show typical cherry-red spots. In Fig. 1 C, although the inner retinal thickening and high reflection are obvious, the CRAO patient did not show cherry-red spots in the fundus. Extensive flaming retinal haemorrhage due to RVO covered the fovea. In addition, various reasons that lessen the chance of manifesting inner retinal coagulative necrosis and high reflection (6 cases, 19.35%) could cause the absence of cherry red spots in CRAO. In Fig. 1 B, one patient presented 1 h after the onset of CRAO with yellow and white arterial emboli (indicated by yellow arrows) at the posterior retina; the patient did not show typical signs of cherry-red spots. The reason is that the inner retinal coagulative necrosis and increased hyperreflective is not obvious, which could be confirmed by OCT, because the infarction time is too short. In the present study, 4 cases (12.90%) of CRAO with ciliary retinal artery sparing also led to the absence of cherry-red spots. In Fig. 1 D, one CRAO patient with ciliary retinal artery sparing showed a clear dividing line between the ciliary retinal artery perfusion area and infraction area. OCT showed obvious inner retinal thickening and increased hyperreflective in the infarction area. In addition, 3 cases (9.68%) of CRAO with macular oedema and 1 case (3.23%) of CRAO with cherry-red spot enlargement did not show typical cherry-red spots. In Fig. 1 D, one patient with CRAO did not show cherry-red spots due to high macular oedema, as shown by OCT. In Fig. 1 E, a CRAO patient combined with unknown severe macular oedema showed no obvious cherry-red spots. In Fig. 1 F, a CRAO patient combined with diabetes retinopathy, the cherry-red spot was actually enlarged after macular cystoid oedema due to diabetes retinopathy. It was mistaken for macular haemorrhage.

### Bergmeister's papilla in a young patient with type 1 sialidosis: case report [^111r1w7P]. BMC Ophthalmology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Sialidosis is a rare genetic lysosomal storage disorder caused by a deficit of neuraminidase enzyme activity. Patients with sialidosis present various neurological disorders such as: myoclonic epilepsy and hypotonia, often associated with visual impairment. A typical aspect of sialidosis is the finding of a macular cherry-red spot on ocular fundus examination. In this paper we describe a unilateral case of Bergmeister's papilla (BP) in a young female patient suffering from type 1 sialidosis.

Case presentation

A 28-year-old young woman suffering from type 1 sialidosis, confirmed by previously described compound heterozigosity Leu91Arg and Gly328Ser on N-acetyl-alpha-neuraminidase − 1 (NEU1) gene, underwent an opthalmological examination at the Eye Clinic of the University of Campania L. Vanvitelli, for bilateral visual deterioration. The patient was suffering from myoclonic epilepsy with hypotonia and severe motor disability. Fundoscopic examination showed a typical macular cherry-red spot with retinal pigment epithelium dystrophy in the middle periphery, in both eyes. Furthermore, in the left eye (OS), a vitreous thickening was observed in the nasal sector of the optic disc, remnant of fetal vasculature on the optic disc (Bergmeister's papilla). Optical coherence tomography (OCT) showed, in both eyes, a thickening of the ganglion cell layer (GCL) with a hyperreflective opacity as a cap on the left optic disc.

Conclusions

In our paper we have described, for the first time in literature, a case of BP in a patient with type 1 sialidosis. The detection of BP with thickening of the peripapillary vitreous by SD-OCT is useful in monitoring any vitreo-retinal change that could cause future visual deterioration.

### Central retinal artery occlusion with cilioretinal sparing in a patient with eisenmenger syndrome [^1121i4RK]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). High credibility.

A young boy in his 20s presented with sudden diminution of vision in right eye 2 days ago. Best-corrected visual acuity was hand movement in right eye and 20/20 in left eye. Funduscopy demonstrated diffuse retinal opacification and swelling at the posterior pole with a cherry red spot at the macula. There was sparing of the superonasal macula with a patent cilioretinal artery. OCT showed diffuse inner retinal thickening of the temporal macula. He was diagnosed as central retinal artery occlusion with cilioretinal sparing in right eye. He was a known case of Eisenmenger syndrome secondary to a large congenital ventricular septal defect. Medical history was notable for prominent pulmonary hypertension and shortness of breath on exertion. Physical examination revealed a harsh systolic murmur. Extremities showed digital erythema and severe clubbing. Chest X-ray demonstrated cardiomegaly. Laboratory examination revealed haemoglobin-220 g/L, haematocrit-60%, serum iron-20 µg/dL.

Leuko-axonopathies in the context of early-onset neuronal degeneration: GM1 gangliosidosis

GM1 gangliosidosis is an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder characterized by variable degrees of neurodegeneration and visceral and skeletal abnormalities. It is due to mutations in the GLB1 gene resulting in decreased activity of the lysosomal enzyme acid β-galactosidase. This leads to accumulation of GM1 ganglioside substrates in lysosomes in the CNS, bones and visceral organs. Clinically, GM1 gangliosidosis shows a continuum of clinical presentations from a severe infantile form to a milder, chronic adult form, with an inverse correlation between disease severity and residual enzymatic activity.

The type I, infantile form of GM1 gangliosidosis has onset in the first six months of life. It is characterized by rapid psychomotor deterioration and severe CNS involvement with spasticity, deafness, blindness, and decerebrate rigidity. Hepatosplenomegaly, coarse facial features, macular cherry-red spots, and skeletal dysplasia are also present, and death supervenes within ages one and three years. MRI shows diffuse white matter signal changes that are too marked to be only ascribed to delayed myelination (Fig. 6 a). The cerebellar white matter is also involved, whereas the brainstem and corpus callosum appear better myelinated. Subtle signal changes are also visible in the thalamus and basal nuclei. Type II GM1 gangliosidosis, or late-infantile/juvenile form, has onset between six months and two years. It presents with psychomotor deterioration, progressive dementia, spasticity and cerebellar ataxia, extrapyramidal signs and epilepsy. Skeletal dysplasia may be associated, but hepatosplenomegaly and cherry-red spots are usually absent. MRI shows progressive global atrophy accompanied by subtle white matter signal abnormalities. Patients may survive into childhood. Type III GM1 gangliosidosis, the adult/chronic form begins in the second to third decade of life and is characterized by localized skeletal involvement and cardiomyopathy. CNS involvement is focal, usually presenting as dystonia or gait or speech disturbance. Epilepsy may occur, and cognition is impaired. MRI reveals signal changes and atrophy of the caudate nucleus and putamen, mild diffuse cerebral atrophy and subtle signal changes in the white matter.

### A sialidosis type I cohort and a quantitative approach to multimodal ophthalmic imaging of the macular cherry-red spot [^115xFz4K]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2021). Medium credibility.

On motility exam, five patients had normal ductions, pursuits and saccades. Among the remaining three, Patient V showed slow horizontal saccades, Patient VIII had saccadic pursuit and Patient IV presented with slow horizontal saccades and saccadic pursuit, as well as occasional slow-amplitude and large-amplitude vertical pendular nystagmus.

The corneas of our patients were clear. All of them (100%) presented visually non-significant changes on their lenses (figure 1A), such as scattered white speckles and punctate opacities affecting the cortex or the nucleus.

Figure 1
Ophthalmological features of patients with sialidosis type I. (A) Cortical and nuclear dot-like lens opacities (Patient VI). (B) Colour retinography showing a classic macular cherry-red spot (Patient VII). (C) Colour retinography showing a faded macular cherry-red spot in Patients IV (left) and VIII (right). (D) Multimodal imaging showing an infrared retinography on the left and autofluorescence imaging on the right (both from Patient I).

The two patients who had decreased visual acuity had pale optic discs and the thinnest RNFL of the cohort: 68 μm in Patient IV and 72 μm in Patient VIII. The other six patients had normal optic disc colour and cupping. The remaining four adults had a mean RNFL thickness of 121.2 ± 10 μm, whereas the two children (Patients I and II) had a mean RNFL of 93 μm. There was a statistically significant correlation between RNFL thickness OD and OS (Spearman correlation, p < 0.001, R = 0.93) and no significant differences with the group of healthy volunteers (unpaired t-test, p = 0.97). RNFL thickness was not associated with patients' age (linear regression, p = 0.81), but it showed a statistically significant association with visual acuity (linear regression, p = 0.001).

### A sialidosis type I cohort and a quantitative approach to multimodal ophthalmic imaging of the macular cherry-red spot [^1163pGtD]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2021). Medium credibility.

All patients presented with a macular cherry-red spot (figure 1B). African American patients presented with a darker 'cherry-brown' spot due to the increased pigment density in their RPE. Qualitatively, the patient with the least clear macular cherry-red spot by colour fundus imaging was Patient IV, followed by Patient VIII (figure 1C). This difficulty was due to a faded pale ring surrounding the obscured fovea, causing a less striking contrast between the foveal spot and the retina. The remaining six patients had a prototypical, obvious macular cherry-red spot. Both in red-free and in autofluorescence imaging, the pale ring surrounding the obscured fovea is enhanced, making it easier to discern the presence of the macular cherry-red spot (figure 1D).

While analysing the macular OCT studies, we took into consideration structural parameters and reflectivity. The mean macular volume of our cohort was 9.95 ± 1.02 mm 3, the mean central foveal thickness (1 mm around the fixation point) was 263.5 ± 22 μm and the mean thickness of the midperipheral ring area (3 mm area around the fixation point) was 325 ± 33 μm, averaging the superior, inferior, nasal and temporal subfields. There was a significant correlation of these three macular parameters between OD and OS (Spearman correlation, p = 0.0004, R = 0.89, p = 0.005, R = 0.76, p < 0.0001, R = 0.95, respectively) and no significant differences between these values and those of healthy volunteers. There were no significant associations between these structural values and age (linear regression, p = 0.3, p = 0.13 and p = 0.91, respectively) or visual acuity. As mentioned by Yamazaki et al, due to the increased reflectivity of the ganglion cell layer (GCL) in sialidosis patients, the limit between this and the RNFL is difficult to determine and therefore quantifying the thickness of GCL becomes unreliable. In our case, both automatic and manual measurements were attempted and disregarded due to high variability and poor correlation with the other structural parameters.

### Hyperbaric oxygen therapy for central retinal artery occlusion: patient selection and perspectives [^112G7s57]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2021). Medium credibility.

Acute pan-retinal hypoperfusion results in ischemia in the inner retinal layers (ganglion cell layer and inner nuclear layer) within minutes after the onset of the condition, which expresses itself as diffuse inner retinal whitening. Over the next few hours, the severity of the ischemia will worsen even further. Ischemia most commonly occurs in the macular region; therefore, opacification is usually limited to the posterior pole; however, in more peripheral areas, the non-perfused inner retina retains its transparency due to the lack of blood supply to the area. The foveola, in contrast to the macula, which contains only the photoreceptor layer that is supplied by choroidal circulation, does not show any indications of opacification or haziness. The traditional "Cherry Red Spot" discovery is created by a contrast between the peri-foveolar whitening caused by infarction and the retinal pigment epithelium under the foveola, which is visible under the microscope. Remember that the cilioretinal artery, which is a branch of the choroidal arterial supply, is present in 15% to 30% of the general population. A portion of the retina surrounding the macula, which is the portion of the retina responsible for central vision, is supplied by this blood vessel. It is possible for patients who have a cilioretinal artery to retain some degree of central vision after having surgery to repair it since this area of the retina is still being perfused at the time of surgery to repair it. When a cilioretinal artery becomes clogged, the visual prognosis is dictated by how much of the macular blood supply is dependent on this vessel, regardless of the reason.

Where in the body the blockage of CRA takes place is not known at this point. When it comes to embolic occlusive illness, the narrowest section of the central retinal artery, which is positioned at the point where it pierces the dural sheath of the optic nerve, is a region that is commonly implicated.

### A sialidosis type I cohort and a quantitative approach to multimodal ophthalmic imaging of the macular cherry-red spot [^111h8AB1]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2021). Medium credibility.

Reflectivity of the OCTs was measured using greyscale analysis (Fiji/ImageJ2). We first selected the OCT cut that crossed through the foveola, from both the right and left eyes of each individual. Second, we drew a line in the middle of the foveola to divide the macular OCT into temporal and nasal subfields. Two line selections were then placed 700 μm nasal and temporal from the middle line and analysed using the Plot Profile tool. These lines started in the vitreous cavity and cross perpendicular to the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) until reaching the choroid. We quantified the first peak value, which occurred when the line crossed from the vitreous cavity to the inner retina. To avoid false readings due to artefacts interfering with the overall OCT reflectivity, we normalised the data taking as the individual's baseline the reflectivity of the entire region from the posterior border of the RNFL down to the posterior border of the RPE (standardisation used by Gardiner et al). Macular OCTs from 16 healthy volunteers were analysed for comparison. The normal subjects' ages were ± 5 years of one of the patients, they had mild to no refractive error and their exams were done dilated. We analysed both the macular structural parameters and the reflectivity of the inner layers of each of their eyes.

Statistical analysis of different variables was performed using GraphPad Prism 8.2.0, and the threshold to determine significance was p < 0.05. One limitation of our statistical analyses, however, was the relatively small cohort. Therefore, we took into account all 16 eyes from affected individuals and 32 from healthy controls when performing the calculations.

A follow-up evaluation was obtained in four patients (50%). Genetic, biochemical and systemic information of these patients was provided by the primary team and these results were tabulated.

### Sialidosis type I: ophthalmological findings [^116eyP5M]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

Sialidosis is a lysosomal storage disease caused by deficit of neuraminidase. It is an autosomal recessive disease, heterogeneous in its onset, presentation and prognosis. We report a case of a male patient with molecular and enzymatic confirmation of the diagnosis. Symptoms began at age 26 with reduced visual acuity, bilateral cherry-red spots and later myoclonus. A brother, now deceased, had the same confirmed disease. We describe the symptoms and clinical findings of the patient, as well review the current knowledge on the topic. With this report, we highlight the importance of a clinical history integrating all the patient's symptoms in order to achieve the diagnosis. In the presence of a cherry-red spot, a comprehensive study is mandatory. Despite being a rare disease, sialidosis carries a significant burden for its patients and its diagnosis should always be considered in the appropriate setting.

### A sialidosis type I cohort and a quantitative approach to multimodal ophthalmic imaging of the macular cherry-red spot [^115SGerW]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2021). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

The ophthalmological spectrum of sialidosis type I is characterised by a progressive decline in visual acuity, macular cherry-red spot and diffuse mild lens opacities. The basis for the progressive vision loss has not been clearly established, but it has been speculated that it is driven by progressive optic atrophy, yet, review of the literature offers a somewhat conflicting account. As lysosomal storage disorders, both sialidosis and galactosialidosis are associated with progressive lysosomal accumulation of undigested sialylated substrates, especially in neural tissue. This process drives neuronal cell death and neurodegenerative symptoms progression. A macular cherry-red spot in other lysosomal storage diseases, including sialidosis and galactosialidosis, is caused by substrate accumulation within the retinal GCL. Although histopathology studies have not been reported for sialidosis and galactosialidosis, this was clearly described for Tay-Sachs disease.

On our literature review of 17 reported sialidosis cases including ophthalmological data, a macular cherry-red spot was often a key finding prompting further metabolic and molecular investigations which ultimately lead to an accurate molecular diagnosis. As to other ophthalmological features, the data is conflicting. Decreased visual acuity was present in five cases (29%), none of which were reported to have optic atrophy. Three patients (18%) were found to have optic atrophy, all with good visual function (ages 14, 15 and 21). Lowden and O'Brien reviewed the cases of sialidosis published before 1979 and found decreased visual acuity in all cases (n = 10). Caciotti et al described a cohort of five patients, only two of which had decreased visual acuity (ages 13 and 19), but none had reported optic atrophy. In aggregate, these studies would suggest that the presence of a cherry-red spot offers relatively little additional information on rate of disease progression or long-term visual function. These ambiguities and inconsistencies reinforce the need for longitudinal observational studies such as ours. Our cohort is the largest to date with comprehensive multimodal ophthalmic investigation in patients with sialidosis type I, covering a wide age range (from 12 to 41 years old). Unlike the scattered case reports in the literature, having evaluated these patients at the same centre, with the same instruments and by the same team, makes these data suitable to be analysed as a group and provides a solid starting point for longitudinal exploration of visual function in this disease.

### First report of two Taiwanese siblings with sialidosis type I: a 10-year follow-up study [^113XJ5xm]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2006). Low credibility.

We report the clinical features, electrophysiological findings and genetic characteristics of the first two Taiwanese siblings ever reported with sialidosis type I. We also provide a 10-year follow-up result. Enzymological analysis revealed a primary sialidase deficit. The back-averaged electroencephalography demonstrated myoclonic jerk-related cortical activities and the somatosensory evoked potential studies revealed giant cortical components. During the 10-year follow-up, the brain magnetic resonance images of the younger brother remained normal, whereas they showed mild cerebellar atrophy in the older sister. Macular cherry red spots were absent in both siblings. However, visual evoked potential revealed progressively prolonged latencies of P100 bilaterally, which was consistent with progressive deterioration of the siblings' visions. DNA analysis showed that the siblings had a homozygous missense point mutation c.544A→G (Ser182Gly) in the exon 3 of the alpha-N-acetyl-neuraminidase (NEU1) gene. The mutation is predicted to cause a decreased sialidase activity but the mutant sialidase can still be targeted to the lysosomes, which may correlate with the mild clinical phenotypes and absent cherry red spots in the siblings.

### Bilateral ophthalmic artery occlusion in a patient with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and central nervous system lymphoma [^1144bt9k]. Ophthalmology (2002). Low credibility.

Purpose

Clinical course and autopsy findings in a patient with human immunodeficiency virus-1 immunodeficiency, central nervous system lymphoma, and bilateral, simultaneous ophthalmic artery occlusions.

Design

Observational case report.

Methods

Clinical examination, fundus photography, gross and microscopic pathologic study.

Results

Fundus photographs disclosed stasis in retinal arterioles, the absence of a cherry-red spot; internal carotid arteriography disclosed bilateral ophthalmic artery occlusions; postmortem histopathologic examination disclosed bilateral ophthalmic artery atherosclerosis, retinal ischemic necrosis, ischemic optic neuropathy, diffuse large-cell lymphoma of multiple areas of the central nervous system, cytomegalovirus encephalitis, atherosclerosis, and bronchopneumonia.

Conclusions

A 47-year-old male with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, profound immunodeficiency, systemic hypertension, and central nervous system lymphoma, developed deep vein thrombosis, bilateral ophthalmic artery occlusions, and died of pneumonia 7 weeks after the onset of blindness. Postmortem study revealed bilateral ophthalmic artery hemorrhagic atherosclerosis, ischemic optic neuropathy, ischemic retinal necrosis, diffuse large-cell central nervous system lymphoma, cytomegalovirus encephalitis, pneumonitis, and systemic atherosclerosis.

### Bilateral central retinal artery occlusion in infective endocarditis [^116aQQCX]. Journal of Vitreoretinal Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

This report describes a patient with bilateral, sequential central retinal artery occlusions (CRAOs) due to infective endocarditis (IE).

Methods

A case report is presented.

Results

A 35-year-old man with IE who recently completed a course of intravenous antibiotic therapy presented with sudden right-eye vision loss. Examination revealed hand motion vision, a cherry-red spot in the macula in the right eye, and an embolus in the inferotemporal arcade of the left eye. The diagnosis of right-eye CRAO secondary to IE was made, with the presumed source being his dental caries. The patient was admitted with plans for aortic valve replacement and dental extraction. During his hospitalization, the patient suffered from a CRAO in his left eye, resulting in bilateral loss of vision.

Conclusions

IE can have severe embolic complications; prompt diagnosis and treatment medically and surgically are necessary to reduce further morbidity and mortality.

### Neuroprotection for nonarteritic central retinal artery occlusion: lessons from acute ischemic stroke [^115jrk7C]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2023). Medium credibility.

In a clinical context, retinal survival and, by extension, treatment outcome of CRAO could also depend on the degree of occlusion. Retinal survival depends on if the retinal artery occlusion is complete (retinal infarction could occur in as short a time as within 15mins) or partial (would have a more prolonged retinal survival because of residual perfusion and effect of collateral circulation). Because of uncertainty regarding the completeness and duration of the retinal artery occlusion, CRAO patients are usually offered treatment even if the timing from the onset of occlusion to presentation is deemed to be several hours. Patients with incomplete occlusion are more likely to have a favorable outcome than eyes with complete occlusion. The clinical dilemma regarding the uncertainty of the completeness of occlusion may explain the unpredictability of response to the treatment of CRAO. Figure 1 presents a probably less severe and incomplete CRAO with seemingly less macular infarction; Figure 2 shows a more severely infarcted retina with significant macular edema and pallor, suggesting a subtotal CRAO. Figure 3 is the fluorescein angiography of Figure 2. Paradoxically visual treatment outcome was better in the patient represented by Figure 2 with a more infarcted retina, supporting a multifactorial effect on treatment outcome.

Figure 1
Right eye fundus photography taken at presentation of a forty-year-old male who gave a six-day history of sudden loss of vision in the eye. Prior to his presentation, CRAO had been diagnosed and ocular digital massage was performed without an improved vision. He had a visual acuity of counting fingers and features of central retinal artery occlusion with mild retinal edema and faint cherry-red spot. These findings are suggestive of incomplete CRAO. Surgical intervention on day 9 after symptom onset consisting of combination vitrectomy with manipulation of intraocular pressure resulted in a Snellen visual acuity of 6/60 which was maintained after 6 months of follow-up.

Figure 2
Left eye fundus photography taken at presentation of a twenty-nine-year-old male who presented with sudden painless loss of vision of less than ten hours prior to presentation. The visual acuity was counting fingers, showing a more severe central arterial occlusion with a more prominent cherry-red spot, significant macular edema, and pallor. Findings are suggestive of a subtotal CRAO. He had surgical intervention approximately fifteen hours after symptom onset. At two months post-surgery Snellen visual acuity in the left eye was 6/36.

### Fundus autofluorescence and optical coherence tomography of a macular cherry-red spot in a case report of sialidosis [^114ur1WJ]. BMC Ophthalmology (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Sialidosis is a rare autosomal recessive disorder resulting from a deficiency of alpha-N-acetyl neuraminidase caused by a mutation in the NEU gene located on 6p21.33. This results in abnormal intracellular accumulation of sialyloligosaccharides, especially in brain neurons and in ganglion cells of the retina. A definitive diagnosis involves confirmation of a NEU gene mutation or a deficiency of neuraminidase activity in leukocytes and cultured fibroblasts using skin biopsies.

Sialidosis is clinically classified as two major phenotypes: type I, a cherry-red spot myoclonus syndrome without dysmorphism, and type II, a more severe infantile form with dysmorphism. Our case presented with bilateral cherry-red spots and myoclonus without mental deterioration and dysmorphism, which was consistent with type I.

The retinal ganglion cells are part of the CNS neurons. Retinal ganglion cell microstructure can be observed using an ophthalmoscope or by OCT. In the OCT images of the patient, abnormal hyperreflective areas were detected in the ganglion cell layer; however, the boundaries between the hyperreflective areas and the normal retinas were not clear. FAF imaging of the patient revealed bilateral hyperautofluorescent lesions surrounding a small hyporeflective center, the fovea. Because lipofuscin, which can be detected by excitation at 488 nm, is the primary source of retinal autofluorescence, the hyperreflective areas in retinal lesions indicate intracytoplasmic accumulation of lipofuscin-like granules from a metabolic disease such as sialidosis. There are two interpretations for the retinal cherry-red spots in sialidosis. One is the deposition of lipofuscin granules in the ganglion cell layer in the perifoveal areas that result in a white patch around the fovea. Alternatively, the foveal pit lacks ganglion cells, and thus continues to maintain its reddish appearance.

In conclusion, when evaluating a patient with a cherry-red spot in the macula, which is not due to arterial occlusion or trauma, the diagnosis should consider various forms of lysosomal storage diseases. It is important to note that ophthalmic images using FAF and OCT are very sensitive and useful methods for detecting neurological metabolic disorders presenting with a cherry-red spot in the macula.

### Newborn skin: part I. common rashes… [^114LvLL3]. AAFP (2008). Low credibility.

HARLEQUIN COLOR CHANGE Harlequin color change occurs when the newborn lies on his or her side. It consists of erythema of the dependent side of the body with simultaneous blanching of the contralateral side. The color change develops suddenly and persists for 30 seconds to 20 minutes. It resolves with increased muscle activity or crying. This phenomenon affects up to 10 percent of full-term infants, but it often goes unnoticed because the infant is bundled. Each pustule is surrounded by a blotchy area of erythema, leading to what is classically described as a "flea-bitten" appearance. Lesions usually occur on the face, trunk, and proximal extremities. Palms and soles are not involved. Several infections.

Each vesicle evolves, with rupture followed by desquamation, and may persist for hours to days. Miliaria rubra, also known as heat rash, is caused by a deeper level of sweat gland obstruction. Its lesions are small erythematous papules and vesicles, usually occurring on covered portions of the skin. Miliaria crystallina and miliaria rubra are benign. Avoidance of overheating, removal of excess clothing, cooling baths, and air conditioning are recommended for management and prevention of these disorders. 6.

### Sialidosis type 1 without cherry-red spots: a case report and literature review [^112njPVb]. BMJ Neurology Open (2024). High credibility.

Background

Sialidosis is a rare disorder caused by mutations in the NEU1 gene located on chromosome 6p21.3, constituting a group of autosomal recessive diseases. Enzyme activity analysis, electron microscopy examination and genetic testing are reliable methods for diagnosis. Despite previous reports on the disease, its rarity means that its clinical manifestations and prognosis still warrant attention due to the limited amount of information available.

Methods

We report a case of a 40-year-old woman who was admitted to our hospital for worsening dysarthria of 16 years duration and facial and limb twitching that had been present for 2 years. Genetic testing was undertaken.

Results

Genetic testing confirmed type I sialidosis, the first reported instance of this disease in the Hainan Free Trade Port in China. The patient did not have the typical cherry-red spot in the fundus. Despite aggressive treatment, she died of status epilepticus 2 months later. This result indicates that the disease has a poor prognosis.

Discussion

Cherry-red spots in the fundus are characteristic features of type I sialidosis and it has been referred to as the cherry-red spot myoclonus syndrome. We hypothesise that environmental factors may also play a significant role. Overemphasis on the presence of cherry-red spots may mislead clinicians and delay diagnosis. Furthermore, patients presenting with isolated myoclonus should undergo visual evoked potential and somatosensory evoked potential tests, as well as genetic testing to confirm or rule out sialidosis.

### Bergmeister's papilla in a young patient with type 1 sialidosis: case report [^116ZoVjF]. BMC Ophthalmology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Sialidosis is a rare genetic lysosomal storage disease caused by mutations in the N-acetyl-alpha-neuraminidase − 1 (NEU1) gene (chromosome 6p21), encoding the lysosomal enzyme neuraminidase, which triggers the degradation of sialyloligosaccharides in lysosomes. The mutations cause a decrease in enzymatic activity and, consequently, an accumulation of sialyloligosaccharides in the tissues. Two forms of the disease have been identified: type 1 sialidosis (ST-1) with later onset and better prognosis, and type 2 sialidosis (ST-2), a more severe early-onset condition. The main characteristics of type 1 sialidosis are: myoclonic epilepsy, cerebellar ataxia, hypotonia and progressive visual decline. Instead, ST-2 is characterized by early onset, sometimes it can be congenital, and causes facial dysmorphism, bone dysplasia or psychomotor retardation. Almost all patients with sialidosis have a cherry-red spot in the macular region, which is therefore an important distinctive element in the differential diagnosis with other neurological metabolic disorders. Other possible ocular features, prevalent in ST-1, are: nystagmus, night blindness and in some cases the presence of corneal opacities. In this paper we describe, for the first time, a case of ST-1 with the typical macular cherry-red spot, associated with a residue of hyaloid artery on the left optic disc (Bergmeister's papilla).

### Central retinal artery occlusion without cherry-red spots [^113GM7gn]. BMC Ophthalmology (2023). Medium credibility.

However, cherry-red spots are not unique to CRAO. Diseases that lead to retinal ischaemia and infarction and as well as diseases that lead to the accumulation of different substances in retinal ganglion cells might also present with cherry-red spots. In addition, cherry-red spots do not occur in all CRAO patients, especially in the chronic stage and during reperfusion of the retinal vessels, when the fundus colour returned to normal. The incidence of cherry-red spots in CRAO is inconsistent. A recent study reported that cherry-red spots were present in 66.7% of CRAO patients. In the present study, we retrospectively collected the clinical manifestations of 70 cases of CRAO and analysed the causes and imaging features of CRAO without cherry-red spots.

### A longitudinal study of Taiwanese sialidosis type 1: an insight into the concept of cherry-red spot myoclonus syndrome [^116YXJb2]. European Journal of Neurology (2009). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Sialidosis type 1 (ST-1) is a neurodegenerative disorder with limited long-term follow-up report. This study is to document the chronological profile of ST-1.

Methods

We perform serial analysis of 17 Taiwanese patients with ST-1 focusing on evolution of clinical features, electrophysiological findings, genetic studies, and neuroimage examinations.

Results

All patients had a mutation at 554A→G in exon 3 of the NEU1 gene causing Ser182Gly substitution. Fifteen patients were homozygous. Two patients were heterozygous with novel mutations, 956C→T causing Ala319Val in one and 163C→T causing Gln55stop codon in the other. The neuraminidase activity was markedly decreased in all 11 available patients. Only three patients (17.6%) manifested the macular cherry-red spot. The majority of patients (82.3%) developed full-blown manifestation of myoclonus, ataxia, and seizures within 5 years. Abnormal somatosensory evoked potentials with giant cortical waves were found in all patients. Prolonged P100 peak latency of the visual evoked potentials (VEPs) were found in 16 patients (94.1%) in the early stage even without visual symptoms.

Conclusion

ST-1 in Taiwanese population illustrates distinct characteristics of phenotype with infrequent cherry-red spot. We suggest to screen the NEU1 mutations in patients presenting action myoclonus with abnormal VEPs, even without macular cherry-red spots.

### A sialidosis type I cohort and a quantitative approach to multimodal ophthalmic imaging of the macular cherry-red spot [^112ZFa7K]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2021). Medium credibility.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Eight patients enrolled in an institutional review board-approved protocol; 'Nervous System Degeneration in Glycosphingolipid Storage Disorders' (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00029965) at the National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA. At the time of enrollment, all eight were known to have elevated urinary sialyloligosaccharides, clinical evidence of a 'cherry-red' spot on fundus examination and neurological dysfunction including myoclonus, seizures and ataxia. Seven patients had biallelic mutations in the gene NEU1. The eighth, who was NEU1 mutation-negative, was subsequently found to have biallelic mutations in CTSA confirming a diagnosis of galactosialidosis. Since the cell biological, biochemical and ophthalmological features of sialidosis and galactosialidosis overlap at many levels, we will refer to our cohort as a whole. Thus, 8 patients and 16 eyes were included in this study.

As part of a comprehensive natural history study, all patients underwent detailed evaluation by an ophthalmologist, who tailored the testing to the patients' ability to participate in the exam. The exam included medical history, visual acuity measurement using ETDRS, Ishihara plates colour vision test, ocular motility and a slit lamp and fundus evaluation. Colour and red-free fundus photographs were acquired in the eight patients (Topcon Medical Systems, Oakland, New Jersey, USA). Four patients had fundus autofluorescence imaging (Topcon) and two had ultrawide-field imaging (Optos, Dunfermline, Scotland).

Optical coherence tomography (OCT) was obtained dilated, using Cirrus HD-OCT (Carl Zeiss Meditec, Dublin, California, USA). The scanning included retinal nerve fibre layer (RNFL) thickness and the macular cube protocol. The latter consists of the analysis of a 6 mm 2 area of the macula by 128 horizontal lines, each consisting of 512 A-scans per line. Macular thickness was then calculated as a total and in nine different sections, according to the Age-Related Eye Disease Study subfields. The central subfield corresponds to a circular area of 1 mm diameter, centered around the fixation point and the inner subfields are limited to a concentrically larger ring measuring 3 mm in diameter, excluding the central subfield previously described.

### Central retinal artery occlusion-rethinking retinal survival time [^1153ZT96]. BMC Ophthalmology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The critical time from onset of complete occlusion of the central retinal artery (CRA) to functionally significant inner retinal infarction represents a window of opportunity for treatment and also has medical-legal implications, particularly when central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO) complicates therapeutic interventions. Here, we review the evidence for time to infarction from complete CRAO and discuss the implications of our findings.

Methods

A Medline search was performed using each of the terms "central retinal artery occlusion", "retinal infarction", "retinal ischemia", and "cherry red spot" from 1970 to the present including articles in French and German. All retrieved references as well as their reference lists were screened for relevance. An Internet search using these terms was also performed to look for additional references.

Results

We find that the experimental evidence showing that inner retinal infarction occurs after 90–240 min of total CRAO, which is the interval generally accepted in the medical literature and practice guidelines, is flawed in important ways. Moreover, the retinal ganglion cells, supplied by the CRA, are part of the central nervous system which undergoes infarction after non-perfusion of 12–15 min or less.

Conclusions

Retinal infarction is most likely to occur after only 12–15 min of complete CRAO. This helps to explain why therapeutic maneuvers for CRAO are often ineffective. Nevertheless, many CRAOs are incomplete and may benefit from therapy after longer intervals. To try to avoid retinal infarcton from inadvertent ocular compression by a headrest during prone anesthesia, the eyes should be checked at intervals of less than 15'.

GM2 gangliosidoses

Pathophysiology and clinical presentation

GM2 gangliosidoses are a group of leuko-axonopathies characterized by deficient degradation of GM2 gangliosides. Affected patients have mutations in the subunits of N-acetyl-β-hexosaminidase (Hex) isoenzymes or in their cofactor, GM2 activator protein. We focus on isoenzyme deficiencies in this review, as they are the targets for current gene therapy approaches. Biallelic mutations in HEXA, which encodes the α subunit, cause Tay-Sachs disease (TSD); biallelic mutations in HEXB, which encodes the β subunit, cause Sandhoff disease (SD). Toxic accumulation of GM2 gangliosides primarily occurs in neurons and triggers neuronal apoptosis through calcium dyshomeostasis in the endoplasmic reticulum. The mechanisms by which neuronal cell death drive myelin deficiency and hypomyelination remain unknown but are likely related to non-cell autonomous effects of the oligodendrocyte-axon unit.

Clinically, GM2 gangliosidoses are classified based on age of onset. Patients with the acute infantile variant have the most severe clinical course, presenting at three to six months of age with acute neurologic deterioration characterized by weakness, hypotonia, hyperreflexia, developmental regression, vision impairment, exaggerated startle response, seizures, and death before five years of age. Most patients have a cherry red macula on fundoscopic exam. The subacute juvenile variant presents with developmental regression at two to five years old, followed by spasticity, loss of ambulation, loss of speech, seizures, and progressive brain atrophy, resulting in death by mid-adolescence. Patients with the late-onset variant present in their teenage years or young adulthood. In addition to gait dysfunction and dysarthria, these patients develop neuropsychiatric manifestations and peripheral neuropathy. Patients with SD but not TSD also have systemic disease manifestations, including hepatosplenomegaly, cardiomegaly, macroglossia, and skeletal abnormalities.

### Central retinal artery occlusion without cherry-red spots [^1147yLpH]. BMC Ophthalmology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Cherry-red spots are a very important sign for the clinical diagnosis of central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO). We retrospectively summarized the clinical manifestations of CRAO and analysed the causes and characteristics of CRAO without cherry-red spots. In this study, we explored a diagnostic method for CRAO without cherry red spots.

Methods

Seventy patients (70 eyes) with CRAO were examined retrospectively. Corrected distance visual acuity, fundus photos, FA and OCT images were collected at the first outpatient visit. The causes of CRAO without cherry-red spots were analysed through fundus photos. The incidence of increased hyperreflectivity of the inner retina, central macular thickness (CMT) and arteriovenous transit time in patients with and without cherry-red spots were compared.

Results

Fundus examination showed posterior retinal whitening in 57 cases (81.43%) and cherry-red spots in 39 cases (55.71%). Thirty-one patients presented at the first outpatient visit without cherry-red spots. The reasons for the absence of cherry-red spots included leopard fundus (32.26%), retinal vein occlusion (25.81%), no obvious inner retinal coagulative necrosis (19.35%), ciliary retinal artery sparing (12.90%), high macular oedema (9.68%) and cherry-red spot enlargement (3.23%). OCT revealed increased hyperreflectivity of the inner retina in 67 CRAO patients (95.71%). All 3 patients without increased hyperreflectivity of the inner retina did not present with cherry-red spots at the first visit. The median CMT in patients without cherry-red spots was 166.00 μm, while the median MCT in patients with cherry-red spots was 180.00 μm; there was no significant difference between these two groups (P = 0.467). FA showed delayed arteriovenous transit time > 23 s in 20 patients (28.57%), > 15 s in 43 patients (61.43%) and no delay in 27 patients (30.77%). The median arteriovenous transit time in patients without cherry-red spots was 19.00 s, while it was 18.00 s in patients with cherry-red spots; there was no significant difference between these two groups (P = 0.727).

Conclusions

There are multiple factors that could cause the absence of cherry-red spots in CRAO. The use of OCT to observe increased hyperreflectivity of the inner retina is the most effective imaging method for the early diagnosis of CRAO without cherry-red spots.

### Infantile onset sandhoff disease: clinical manifestation and a novel common mutation in Thai patients [^114ovtwg]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

GM2 gangliosidoses including Tay-Sachs disease (TSD, MIM 272800), Sandhoff disease (SD, MIM 268800), and GM2 activator protein deficiency (GM2AP or AB variant, MIM 272750) are a group of lysosomal storage disorders of which the breakdown of glycosphingolipids, GM2 gangliosides, is impaired, leading to an accumulation of the substrates in various internal organs, particular in neuronal cells. These disorders are resulted from deficiency of β-hexosaminidase enzyme (HEX), or rarely, defect of activator protein. Two isoforms of HEX includes β-hexosaminidase A (HEX-A) consisting of a heterodimer between α- and β-subunit (αβ), and β-hexosaminidase B (HEX-B) consisting of a homodimer of β-subunit (ββ). TSD, SD, and GM2AP deficiency are caused by biallelic pathogenic variants of human HEXA, HEXB, GM2AP gene in respective order. HEXB is located on 5q13, containing 14 coding exons and spanning mRNA of 2 kb, and encoding 556 amino acids.

There are three clinical subtypes in TSD and SD including infantile, juvenile, and adult subtypes. Infantile manifestations of TSD, SD, and GM2AP are clinically indistinguishable. The infantile disease is characterized by development of axial hypotonia, startle response with hyperacusis, developmental regression starting at the age of 3–6 months, followed by progressive loss of motor skill, neurologic signs of upper and lower motor neurons, macrocephaly, seizures, macular cherry-red spots, and eventually death before 3–5 years of age.

Patients with juvenile and adult forms present in early-late childhood or adulthood with slow progression of neurological symptoms such as developmental delay, abnormal gait, ataxia, spinocerebellar and motor neuron dysfunction, increased myotatic reflexes which sometimes are misdiagnosed with late-onset spinal muscular atrophy, and Friedreich ataxia.

Tay-Sachs disease (TSD) is a type 1 gangliosidosis (GM2) and caused by hexosaminidase A deficiency resulting in abnormal sphingolipid metabolism and deposition of precursors in different organs. It is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder transmitted in an autosomal-recessive manner. There is an accumulation of GM2 in neurocytes and retinal ganglions which result in progressive loss of neurological function and formation of the cherry-red spot which is the hallmark of TSD. We report the first case of juvenile TSD from Pakistan in a child with death of an older sibling without the diagnosis.

### Fundus autofluorescence and optical coherence tomography of a macular cherry-red spot in a case report of sialidosis [^113wsx4t]. BMC Ophthalmology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The macular cherry-red spot was first named by Bernard Sachs. It is a very distinctive ocular manifestation of central retinal artery occlusion, traumatic retinal edema, and many neurological metabolic disorders such as Sandhoff disease, galactosialidosis, GM1 and GM2 gangliosidosis, and sialidosis types I and II. Sialidosis is a rare lysosomal storage disorder characterized by deficiency of alpha-N-acetyl neuraminidase. It is transmitted as an autosomal recessive trait and is caused by a mutation in the neuraminidase (NEU) gene. There is a wide clinical spectrum ranging from nearly asymptomatic to severe presentations. The clinical features of sialidosis type I include late-onset, cerebellar ataxia, myoclonic epilepsy, nystagmus, as well as progressive visual loss. The macular cherry-red spot is a very distinctive ocular feature for differential diagnosis of various CNS storage diseases. We evaluated the fundus autofluorescence (FAF) and the optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging in a juvenile patient presenting with a vision decrease, who was later confirmed with genetic sialidosis.

### Ischaemia-reperfusion injury in central retinal artery occlusion [^112aydDs]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

A 53-year-old man presented with sudden painless diminution of vision in his right eye for 3 days. His fundus examination showed diffuse whitening of the retina with a cherry red spot at the fovea with cilioretinal artery sparing. On fluorescein angiography delayed arteriovenous transit was observed. Three-dimensional spectral domain optical coherence tomography was used to assess retinal nerve fibre layer thickness and average macular central subfield thickness on days 3, 7, 30 and 90. Marked retinal oedema due to ischaemia was observed on day 3 of occurrence of central retinal artery occlusion. On day 7, significant decrease in retinal nerve fibre thickness and macular thickness was noted suggestive of acute reperfusion injury. Retinal nerve fibre layer thickness and macular thickness returned to near normal on day 30 due to restoration of blood supply with wash out of stress mediators. Retinal atrophy was observed on day 90.

Overall, the primary care physician can diagnose most cases of red eyes in children, if specific attention is paid to which ocular structures are involved. Accurate diagnosis allows appropriate primary care treatment for most disorders and can aid in determining which cases need referral.

### Sialidosis type 1 without cherry-red spots: a case report and literature review [^1124x331]. BMJ Neurology Open (2024). High credibility.

At present, the treatment for this disease is mainly symptomatic, targeting epileptic seizures and myoclonus. Patients are given levetiracetam, sodiumvalproate, phenobarbital, zonisamide, topiramate and piracetam, and benzodiazepines are beneficial in improving epilepsy and myoclonus symptoms. However, it is necessary to avoid drugs such as carbamazepine, phenytoin, gabapentin and vigabatrin, which can exacerbate myoclonus. Lamotrigine can be used cautiously because it can worsen myoclonus in some patients. Some studies have shown that dietary supplementation with betaine, a natural amino acid derivative, may benefit the treatment of type I sialic acid poisoning by serving as a histone deacetylase inhibitor, inducing a sustained increase in the residual activity of mutated NEU1 in patient primary fibroblasts.

In summary, the manifestation of cherry-red spots in the fundus in type 1 sialidosis might be environment related. Moreover, for patients with clinical myoclonus, especially those with giant cortical waves in somatosensory evoked potentials and prolonged latency of P100 peaks in visual evoked potentials, they should actively improve genetic testing to ascertain if they have sialidosis.

### Bilateral macular halo and full-thickness macular hole repair in Niemann-Pick disease type B [^116aQKU4]. Journal of Vitreoretinal Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

The diagnosis of Niemann-Pick disease type B is often delayed, and individuals usually survive until adulthood. Systemic involvement includes splenomegaly, dyslipidemia, and pulmonary infiltrates, all features our patient exhibited. The CNS is usually spared; however, the retina's involvement as an embryologic extension of the CNS shows this is not entirely true. Variability in the presence of retinal stigmata is understood to be secondary to differences in the ASM mutation in the SMPD1 gene.

In a review of 45 patients with Niemann-Pick disease type B, 12 patients (26.67%) had the perception of a cherry-red spot and 3 patients (6.67%) had bilateral symmetric macular halos. Epigenetics may also play a role because siblings with the same mutation might not all develop retinal stigmata. The cherry-red spots are likely a pseudoappearance and are different from those seen in central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO). In CRAO, cherry-red spots can occur because the associated retinal ischemia causes opacification of the vascularized inner retina but not of the foveal avascular zone (FAZ), which has a choroidal blood supply.

Macular halos are typically asymptomatic. Multimodal imaging of macular halos in Niemann-Pick disease has enabled better characterization of the disease. The clinical examination or color fundus photography shows a white, crystalloid ring up to 3.0 mm in diameter encircling the unaffected fovea. – Lipid deposition is hypothesized to occur in retinal ganglion cells, which are not present in the fovea, thus giving rise to a fovea-sparing red spot. Macular halos have previously been reported to be hypoautofluorescent. This differs from the halos in our case, in which the autofluorescence was unaffected in the area of the halo but a small foveal hyperautofluorescent dot was seen in the right fovea. Red-free photography shows annular hyperreflectivity, as seen in our case.

### Ocular manifestations of Niemann-Pick disease type B [^113pxvFG]. Ophthalmology (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose

To investigate the ocular manifestations in Niemann-Pick disease type B (NPD-B).

Design

Observational case series.

Participants

Forty-five patients (23 male and 22 female) with NPD-B from 37 unrelated families.

Methods

Serial clinical evaluations were carried out over a 2- to 14-year period, including a complete physical examination, neurologic assessment, and ophthalmologic examination. Genotyping of the specific mutations in the acid sphingomyelinase (ASM) gene was performed when possible for genotype-phenotype correlations.

Main Outcome Measures

Fundus photographs to evaluate the retina, ASM genotype, and neurologic examination findings.

Results

Ophthalmoscopic examination revealed retinal stigmata in 15 of 45 patients, 3 with macular halos and 12 with cherry red maculae. Neurologic examinations did not reveal any evidence of neurodegeneration, and there was no consistent relationship between retinal findings and genotype.

Conclusions

The presence of macular halos and/or cherry red maculae is not an absolute predictor of neurodegeneration, but should prompt a thorough evaluation to determine the underlying etiology and the precise diagnosis.

### GM2 gangliosidosis AB variant: novel mutation from India-a case report with a review [^111Z4kxm]. BMC Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

On clinical examination, there was no organomegaly. Significant hyperacusis was noted even to the most trivial sounds. Fundus examination showed bilateral cherry red spot in macula and horizontal nystagmus. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scan of brain revealed putaminal hyperintensity and thalamic hypointensity with some unmyelinated white matter in T2/T1 weighted images (Fig 1 (a)-(b)), which is commonly detected in cases with GM2 gangliosidosis.

(a)-(b): Initial T2 weighted MRI pictures of brain revealed (a) putaminal hyperintensity and (b) thalamic hypointensity with some unmyelinated white matter in T2/T1 weighted images

After obtaining institutional ethics committee approval and informed written consent, further study was carried out. The blood samples of the proband and their parents were taken for the study. Clinical presentation was pointing towards GM2 gangliosidosis. Enzyme activity was determined by fluorimetric method using specific synthetic substrate. Hex-A was assayed with a sulphated substrate 4-methylumbelliferyl-N-acetyl-β-D-glucosamine-6-sulphate (MUGS) whereas total hexosaminidase (total-Hex) was measured from the hydrolysis of the synthetic substrate 4-methylumbelliferyl-Nacetyl-β-D-glucosamine (MUG) that releases fluorescent 4-methylumbelliferone when acted upon by β-hexosaminidase. Enzyme activities for Hex-A [102 nmol/hr/mg protein; NR: 69.0–659.0 nmol/hr/mg protein] and total-Hex [414.9 nmol/hr/mg protein; NR: 288.4–1758.0 nmol/hr/mg protein] were found to be normal. This makes it highly unlikely for Tay-Sachs or B variant and Sandhoff disease or O variant. In presence of strong clinical presentation and normal lysosomal enzyme activity; GM2 gangliosidosis activator deficiency leading to AB variant was carried out by mutation analysis encompassing GM2 activator (GM2A) gene.

Reasons for CRAO without cherry-red spots

Fig. 1
A. One CRAO patient with leopard print fundus showed no typical cherry-red spots. OCT indicated that the choroid was significantly thinner (yellow arrowheads). B. One patient presented 1 h after the onset of CRAO without cherry-red spots. Yellow‒white arterial emboli (the yellow arrowhead) could be seen in the superior temporal branch artery. OCT indicated that there was no obvious inner hyperreflexia. C. One CRAO patient combined with RVO showed no cherry red spots. Massive retinal haemorrhage could be seen in the fundus. OCT showed obvious inner retinal thickening and segmental increased reflection in the inner and outer reticular layers of the macular area (the red arrowheads) that manifested as acute para central middle maculopathy lesions. D. One CRAO patient with ciliary retinal artery perfusion showed no cherry red spots. OCT indicated a dividing line between the ciliary retinal artery perfusion area and infraction area. E. One CRAO patient with unknown macular oedema showed no cherry red spots. F. One CRAO patient with diabetes retinopathy showed no cherry red spots (the OCT scanning area was the centre of the macula). It was mistaken for macular haemorrhage. OCT showed cystoid macular oedema and obvious inner retinal thickening and high reflection
