## Question

Oral antibiotics for liver abscess

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether oral antibiotics are appropriate for liver abscess and, if so, when and how to use them safely and effectively. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and the main types of liver abscess. Then, I should verify the highest-quality evidence comparing oral versus intravenous therapy. Next, I will review pharmacologic considerations like abscess penetration and bioavailability. After that, I need to check guideline positions and stewardship principles. Finally, I will synthesize practical recommendations by scenario, including duration, monitoring, and special populations, and I will double-check for any caveats that could change practice.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and taxonomy, because treatment hinges on etiology and source control. Pyogenic liver abscess is most often due to Gram-negative enteric organisms, with hypervirulent Klebsiella pneumoniae prominent in East Asia and increasingly recognized globally, while amebic liver abscess is caused by Entamoeba histolytica and has different management principles, and fungal or polymicrobial abscesses occur in selected hosts, so I need to ensure I anchor recommendations to these categories and the need for drainage when indicated [^e4fa988b] [^79a399a5] [^c031eff1].

> Now, I should verify the highest-quality evidence on oral versus IV therapy. The pivotal randomized, controlled noninferiority trial in Singapore enrolled adults with Klebsiella pneumoniae liver abscess who had received up to 7 days of effective IV therapy and then compared oral ciprofloxacin for 28 days versus continued IV ceftriaxone for 28 days; clinical cure at 12 weeks was 95.9% with oral therapy versus 92.3% with IV therapy, meeting a 12% noninferiority margin, and serious adverse events were similar, which supports a strategy of early switch to oral therapy after initial IV stabilization in this specific population [^3a8fa402].

> Wait, let me verify the pharmacologic rationale before I overgeneralize. Abscess penetration is limited by fibrous capsules and protein binding; lipophilic agents like fluoroquinolones penetrate abscess walls more effectively than hydrophilic beta-lactams, and ciprofloxacin has been associated with shorter hospital stays and less IV therapy in observational KLA cohorts, though rising fluoroquinolone resistance is a concern and must temper enthusiasm, so I should confirm susceptibility before switching to a fluoroquinolone [^551e6bfe] [^70755508] [^551e6bfe].

> Next, I should review guideline positions to ensure alignment. The Surgical Infection Society recommends substituting selected oral agents with good bioavailability to complete a short course after adequate source control and return of GI function, explicitly endorsing ciprofloxacin plus metronidazole or moxifloxacin as acceptable oral regimens for intra-abdominal infection, which is analogous to pyogenic liver abscess management once the patient is clinically improving and source control is achieved [^93c283bb] [^de3f8c28] [^1c8b7136].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I need to check special scenarios. For amebic liver abscess, metronidazole or tinidazole are first-line and typically given orally, with drainage reserved for select indications such as impending rupture or failure of medical therapy, so oral therapy is standard here rather than an IV-to-PO switch strategy [^79a399a5] [^c188bbf8] [^fd2598e7]. For hepatic cyst infection in ADPKD, guidelines endorse IV third-generation cephalosporins with or without a fluoroquinolone, then step down to an oral fluoroquinolone after stabilization, with prolonged total therapy of at least 4 weeks, reflecting the unique cyst pharmacokinetics and risk of recurrence [^8881c0aa] [^fdbaa7d4] [^795fcd7a].

> I should confirm duration and stewardship principles. Observational emulation suggests that total antibiotic durations of 30 days or fewer are noninferior to longer courses for relapse-free survival, with the signal stronger in drained patients, reinforcing that prolonged IV therapy is not routinely necessary when source control and clinical response are achieved, and that oral completion is acceptable when criteria are met [^4d55418c]. But wait, what if the abscess is undrained or the patient is unstable? In that case, I need to ensure continued IV therapy until source control and clinical stability are achieved before any oral transition [^e4fa988b].

> Let me consider practical oral regimens and caveats. After initial IV stabilization and when susceptibilities allow, ciprofloxacin 750 mg orally twice daily for a total of about 4 weeks, often with metronidazole 500 mg orally three times daily if anaerobic coverage is needed, is reasonable; amoxicillin–clavulanate or moxifloxacin are alternatives per intra-abdominal guidance, but I should double-check local resistance and prior antibiotic exposures before choosing a fluoroquinolone, and I must avoid extending therapy beyond about 4–6 weeks unless there is a compelling indication [^93c283bb] [^de3f8c28] [^4d55418c].

> I need to ensure I address special populations and monitoring. In cirrhosis, dose adjustments and nephrotoxicity risks matter; metronidazole should be dose-reduced in significant hepatic impairment, and vancomycin or aminoglycosides should be used cautiously with level monitoring when absolutely necessary, so I should verify organ function and drug–drug interactions before finalizing an oral regimen [^fb9a21df] [^5da04f02]. In children, evidence is extrapolated; oral step-down is reasonable once clinically improved and GI function is adequate, but I should confirm weight-based dosing and local pediatric protocols before switching [^notfound].

> Next, I should review what would change my mind. If there is ongoing bacteremia, hemodynamic instability, malabsorption, or concern for inadequate source control, I should not switch to oral therapy prematurely; conversely, if cultures show resistance to oral options or the patient cannot adhere, I should maintain IV therapy or choose an alternative oral agent with proven activity and penetration, keeping total duration as short as clinically safe [^0b65ff30] [^e4fa988b].

> Putting this together, I should confirm that oral antibiotics are appropriate for liver abscess when the patient is clinically stable, source control has been addressed, GI function is intact, and susceptibilities support an oral agent with adequate abscess penetration; in KLA, randomized data show oral ciprofloxacin is noninferior to continued IV ceftriaxone after brief initial IV therapy, and broader intra-abdominal guidance supports oral step-down to complete a total of about 4–6 weeks, with shorter validated courses in selected contexts, while amebic abscess is treated primarily with oral metronidazole or tinidazole and ADPKD cyst infection requires prolonged therapy with fluoroquinolone step-down after stabilization [^3a8fa402] [^93c283bb] [^4d55418c] [^79a399a5] [^8881c0aa].

---

Oral antibiotics are appropriate for liver abscess when the patient is **clinically stable**, has **adequate GI function**, and the abscess is **≤ 3 cm or has been drained**. Oral therapy is **noninferior to IV** in Klebsiella pneumoniae liver abscess [^3a8fa402] and is supported by guidelines for step-down after initial IV stabilization [^93c283bb]. Use agents with good bioavailability and abscess penetration (e.g. fluoroquinolones, metronidazole, amoxicillin-clavulanate) [^551e6bfe] for 2–6 weeks, tailored to clinical response and source control [^e4fa988b]. Avoid oral therapy in severe sepsis, large/multiloculated abscesses, or when absorption is uncertain.

---

## Indications for oral antibiotic therapy

Oral antibiotics are appropriate in the following scenarios:

- **Small abscesses**: Single, small (≤ 3 cm) abscesses without sepsis or multiloculation [^e376a1c4].
- **Post-drainage**: After successful percutaneous drainage or aspiration with clinical improvement [^e4fa988b].
- **Stable patients**: Clinically stable patients with adequate GI function and no severe comorbidities [^93c283bb].
- **Step-down therapy**: Transition from IV therapy after initial stabilization and clinical improvement [^d9a375b8].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting oral antibiotic therapy

Recent evidence supports oral therapy in selected liver abscess cases:

- **RCT evidence**: Oral ciprofloxacin was noninferior to IV ceftriaxone in Klebsiella pneumoniae liver abscess, with 95.9% vs 92.3% cure at 12 weeks [^3a8fa402].
- **Guideline support**: SIS recommends oral agents with good bioavailability to complete a short course after source control and clinical improvement [^93c283bb].
- **Real-world data**: Oral step-down is effective in pyogenic liver abscess, including resource-limited settings [^5a7ad181].

---

## Recommended oral antibiotic regimens

| **Antibiotic** | **Indication** | **Dosage** | **Duration** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Ciprofloxacin | Gram-negative coverage, including Klebsiella | 500–750 mg PO BID | 2–6 weeks |
| Metronidazole | Anaerobic coverage, amebic abscess | 500 mg PO TID | 7–10 days (amebic: 10–14 days) |
| Amoxicillin-clavulanate | Broad-spectrum, including Gram-positive and anaerobes | 875/125 mg PO BID | 2–6 weeks |
| Moxifloxacin | Monotherapy for selected cases | 400 mg PO daily | 2–6 weeks |

---

Duration is **individualized** based on clinical response, abscess size, and source control [^e4fa988b].

---

## Factors influencing the choice of oral antibiotics

- **Microbiology**: Tailor to culture results and local resistance patterns [^f6c93906].
- **Patient factors**: Renal/hepatic function, allergies, comorbidities [^fb9a21df].
- **Abscess characteristics**: Size, location, and presence of drainage [^e376a1c4].
- **Penetration**: Prefer agents with good abscess penetration (e.g. fluoroquinolones) [^551e6bfe].

---

## Limitations and contraindications

Oral therapy is **not appropriate** in the following scenarios:

- **Severe sepsis**: Hemodynamic instability or septic shock [^notfound].
- **Large/multiloculated abscesses**: Complex abscesses requiring prolonged IV therapy or surgical intervention [^e376a1c4].
- **Impaired absorption**: Uncertain GI function or malabsorption [^0b65ff30].
- **Resistant organisms**: Infections with organisms not covered by oral agents [^0b65ff30].

---

## Clinical outcomes and recurrence rates

Oral therapy achieves outcomes comparable to IV therapy in appropriately selected patients, with **low recurrence** when source control and adherence are optimized [^3a8fa402] [^4d55418c]. Recurrence is more often linked to inadequate drainage, resistant organisms, or incomplete therapy than to the oral route itself [^fae3f563].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Regular clinical, laboratory, and imaging follow-up is essential to ensure **response and detect complications**. Adjust therapy based on clinical trajectory, CRP trends, and imaging resolution [^e4fa988b].

---

Oral antibiotics are effective for liver abscess in stable patients with small or drained abscesses, offering a safe, convenient, and cost-saving alternative to prolonged IV therapy. Careful patient selection, appropriate agents, and close follow-up are essential to success [^3a8fa402] [^93c283bb].

### Oral vs intravenous antibiotics for patients with Klebsiella pneumoniae liver abscess: a randomized, controlled noninferiority study [^3a8fa402]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Klebsiella pneumoniae liver abscess (KLA) is emerging worldwide due to hypermucoviscous strains with a propensity for metastatic infection. Treatment includes drainage and prolonged intravenous antibiotics. We aimed to determine whether oral antibiotics were noninferior to continued intravenous antibiotics for KLA.

Methods

This noninferiority, parallel group, randomized, clinical trial recruited hospitalized adults with liver abscess and K. pneumoniae isolated from blood or abscess fluid who had received ≤ 7 days of effective antibiotics at 3 sites in Singapore. Patients were randomized 1:1 to oral (ciprofloxacin) or intravenous (ceftriaxone) antibiotics for 28 days. If day 28 clinical response criteria were not met, further oral antibiotics were prescribed until clinical response was met. The primary endpoint was clinical cure assessed at week 12 and included a composite of absence of fever in the preceding week, C-reactive protein < 20 mg/L, and reduction in abscess size. A noninferiority margin of 12% was used.

Results

Between November 2013 and October 2017, 152 patients (mean age, 58.7 years; 25.7% women) were recruited, following a median 5 days of effective intravenous antibiotics. A total of 106 (69.7%) underwent abscess drainage; 71/74 (95.9%) randomized to oral antibiotics met the primary endpoint compared with 72/78 (92.3%) randomized to intravenous antibiotics (risk difference, 3.6%; 2-sided 95% confidence interval, -4.9% to 12.8%). Effects were consistent in the per-protocol population. Nonfatal serious adverse events occurred in 12/72 (16.7%) in the oral group and 13/77 (16.9%) in the intravenous group.

Conclusions

Oral antibiotics were noninferior to intravenous antibiotics for the early treatment of KLA.

Parenteral (non-oral) antibiotic therapy is generally preferred over oral administration to deliver the medication directly into the bloodstream. At present, no randomized clinical trials have specifically assessed the efficacy of various antibiotic regimens for treating KLAs. Consequently, the optimal antibiotic treatment for these infections remains a topic of ongoing debate. Historically, first-generation cephalosporins, with or without aminoglycoside therapy, were commonly selected due to their affordability, effectiveness, and the sensitivity of most hvKp strains that cause KLAs. Cephalosporins combined with aminoglycosides offer synergistic bactericidal activity against certain Gram-negative infections; however, studies have not demonstrated improved clinical outcomes compared to cephalosporins monotherapy, for the treatment of KLAs. Additionally, the use of aminoglycosides carries a risk of nephrotoxicity, which may outweigh any theoretical benefit, particularly in critically ill patients. More recently, thirdgeneration cephalosporins such as ceftriaxone are used to treat KLAs due to their increased stability to β-lactamases and extended half-life for once daily dosing. Additionally, ceftriaxone has a dual mechanism of elimination (through both the liver and kidney), which allows for treatment of patients with hepatic or renal dysfunction. However, even when KLAs are treated with antibiotics deemed appropriate based on in vitro susceptibility testing, outcomes are inconsistent. In some cases, antibiotic therapy combined with drainage effectively resolved the KLA. In other cases, antibiotic therapy with drainage failed to resolve the abscess or fever, necessitating surgical removal of the infected liver tissue even in otherwise healthy individuals. The reasons for these contrasting outcomes are not well understood but could depend on a variety of factors including penetration of the drugs to the site of infection, antagonism of antibiotics by factors encountered at the infection site, or the metabolic state of the bacteria within the abscess (Fig. 1), described in more detail below.

INTRODUCTION

Klebsiella pneumoniae is a Gram-negative, non-motile encapsulated bacteria, and strains are separated into two pathotypes: classical K. pneumoniae (cKp) and hypervirulent K. pneumoniae (hvKp). CKp strains are frequently multidrug resistant and are a major cause of hospital-acquired infections, such as pneumonia, bacteremia, and urinary tract infections (UTIs), particularly in immunocompromised individuals. HvKp can also cause these types of infections but are distinct in their ability to cause severe community-acquired tissue-invasive infections in immunocompetent individuals. While hvKp infections are most prevalent in populations in Asian countries, their incidence is rising globally, and hvKp is now recognized as a significant cause of pyogenic (pus-filled) liver abscesses in the United States and Europe.

K. pneumoniae is a common colonizer of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, detected in 4%–35% of stool samples in Western countries and in 18%–88% of individuals in endemic regions. In Asian populations, approximately 10% of individuals colonized with K. pneumoniae harbor strains that are likely hvKp. However, the prevalence of hvKp GI carriage in Western countries remains poorly defined, as most studies do not distinguish between cKp and hvKp strains.

KLAs can occur when hvKp migrates from the gut to the liver via the portal vein, typically following bowel leakage. However, KLAs can also arise from other primary sites, such as lung or wound infections. Gut colonization by hvKp is also thought to facilitate community transmission through the fecal-oral route.

Once established, hvKp liver abscesses are difficult to treat with antibiotics and are prone to metastatic spread, leading to conditions such as endophthalmitis or meningitis that can result in vision loss or death, respectively. Reported mortality rates for KLAs range from 5% to 40%. Despite the significant clinical impact of KLAs, the mechanisms underlying the poor outcomes are not well understood. In this review, we explore the pathogenesis of KLAs, and the challenges associated with management and treatment of these infections.

### Pyogenic and amebic infections of the liver [^79a399a5]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2020). Medium credibility.

Pyogenic liver abscesses are classified by the bacteria that have caused the abscess because this guides treatment and can point to the underlying cause. The most common cause is biliary disease. The diagnosis is made by imaging. Treatment is a combination of antibiotics and percutaneous drainage. Amebic liver abscess is caused by extraintestinal spread of Entamoeba histolytica. E histolytica is spread by fecal-oral transmission and typically colonizes the gastrointestinal tract. It is diagnosed based on imaging and the mainstay of treatment is metronidazole. Only about 15% of cases require percutaneous drainage. The prognosis is good, with almost universal recovery.

### Clinical and epidemiological characteristics of pyogenic liver abscess in people 65 years or older versus people under 65: a retrospective study [^4fbed319]. BMC Geriatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Today, surgical treatment of PLA has been relegated in favour of the current frontline treatments of antibiotics and aspiration/drainage of the PLA. Moreover, laparoscopic drainage of PLA has also recently been developed as an option for surgical drainage of liver abscess. Our series also reflected this situation; the first treatment was antibiotics and percutaneous aspiration/drainage of PLA, followed by antibiotic alone. Few patients received antibiotics plus surgical treatment, and only one underwent laparoscopic drainage. There were no differences in treatment of PLA between age groups, nor was type of treatment associated with mortality. This observation points to both the appropriateness of the treatment and to the fact that therapeutic efforts are not rationed in older patients.

The use of antibiotics was variable in our study, as in this clinical practice, each attending physician decided the treatment, its duration and the time for switching from intravenous to oral administration. This is a limitation of all retrospective studies, including ours. In intra-abdominal infections, it is important remember to appropriately prescribe antibiotics – and to limit the length of treatment – in order to avert antibiotic resistance. Moreover in our study, the beginning of the antibiotic treatment was not recorded; however, when PLA (or other intra-abdominal infections) is suspected, quickly starting a course of antibiotics reduces mortality.

The appearance of complications, especially septic shock, was more common in patients aged ≥ 65 years. This finding can be explained by the elevated comorbidity in older patients (neoplasm, diabetes mellitus, etc.). In our study the mortality was 8.2% overall, although all deaths occurred in patients aged ≥ 65 years (about 14% of cases in this age group). The mortality in these cases was not really due to age, but rather comorbidities and PLA complications in patients with comorbidities; these factors were more important than age alone. Recently, Martínez-Cecilia et al. reported that octogenarians have comparable outcomes to younger people in colorectal liver metastases when treated with laparoscopic liver resection. Thus, comorbidity and complications are more important prognostic factors than age.

Our study has the inherent limitations of all retrospective studies, particularly the risk of information bias, as it was not always possible to extract all necessary information about the cases.

Conclusions

Despite extensive research in the field of antibiotic regimens in cirrhotic patients there are many unanswered questions, especially with regard to treatment duration. A policy of careful restriction of prophylactic antibiotics to the high-risk populations could reduce the spread of multidrug resistant bacteria.

Abscess penetration

Although there have been limited studies on drug penetration into KLA abscesses, in vivo studies with bacterial abscesses at various anatomical locations have shown that antibiotic penetration into an encapsulated purulent abscess is restricted and largely influenced by the antibiotic class and the level of abscess maturation. The ability of a drug to penetrate the abscess wall depends on the lipophilicity (lipid solubility) of the antibiotic (Fig. 1). Fluoroquinolones and macrolides have high lipophilicity and readily cross membranes, including abscess walls, more effectively than the hydrophilic β-lactams or aminoglycosides. Human and animal pharmacokinetic data indicate that fluoroquinolones, effectively penetrate abscesses. Interestingly, a recent study reported patients suffering with KLAs had shorter hospital stays and required less intravenous antibiotic therapy when treated with fluoroquinolones compared to those treated with β-lactams. The reasons for this are not known but could be at least partially attributed to the hydrophilic nature of β-lactams, which could limit their accumulation inside abscesses compared to lipophilic fluoroquinolones. While fluoroquinolones could be an effective treatment option for KLA infections, their effectiveness is increasingly compromised by rising rates of resistance, particularly in convergent strains.

Fig 1
Barriers to effective antibiotic treatment of liver abscesses caused by hypervirulent K. pneumoniae (hvKp). 1. Limited tissue penetration: For the treatment of KLAs, parenteral antibiotics are typically prescribed for rapid delivery to the bloodstream. However, there is limited blood supply to the abscesses, and so the antibiotic must travel from the bloodstream through the liver tissue and into the abscess. While antibiotics are in the bloodstream, they bind to plasma proteins. Different classes of antibiotic bind plasma protein to varying degrees, and only the unbound fractions can effectively penetrate tissue. Highly protein-bound antibiotics (such as third generation cephalosporins) penetrate tissues at a much slower rate than antibiotics with lower protein binding (such as fluoroquinolones and some carbapenems). 2. Abscess penetration: Abscess maturity and antibiotic lipophilicity determine the extent of antibiotic penetration through the abscess wall. Lipophilic (lipid soluble) antibiotics such as fluoroquinolones and macrolides are more effective at crossing the fibrous abscess wall than hydrophilic drugs like cephalosporins and aminoglycosides. 3. Abscess environment: Stresses encountered in the abscess environment, such as nutrient and oxygen deprivation, reactive oxygen or nitrogen species (ROS/RNS), and low pH are known to coerce bacteria into a low metabolic state, which increases tolerance to antibiotics. The extent to which these stresses contribute to treatment failure of KLAs has not been experimentally determined. 4. Antimicrobial resistance (AMR): The acquisition of genes or genetic mutations which confer resistance by hvKp reduces the repertoire of available antibiotics, limiting treatment options and increasing the risk of severe, recalcitrant infections.

### Periodontal disease and cirrhosis: current concepts and future prospects [^0e478249]. Egastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Standard nonsurgical treatments for periodontal disease include scaling to remove tartar and bacteria from tooth surfaces and the gum line, root planing to smooth root surfaces to prevent further buildup, and intermittent usage of adjunctive oral antibiotics to help control infection. In a randomised controlled trial, dental scaling and root planing were studied in patients with MASLD. Reductions in liver enzyme levels and P. gingivalis antibody titers were observed to correlate with treatment, suggesting a potentially beneficial response.

There are various surgical treatments for advanced periodontitis with associated infectious complications, including dental extraction, abscess drainage, soft tissue grafts, bone surgery/gingivectomy or rarely the need for surgical flaps. These procedures have been infrequently studied in patients with liver disease, and the outcomes and benefits of the underlying liver disease remain uncertain. Most of the dental surgery literature on patients with cirrhosis emphasises the risk of bleeding during surgery. A recent systematic review suggests that patients with cirrhosis, despite having decreased platelets and an increased international normalised ratio (INR), have a relatively lower bleeding risk, emphasising the safety of surgical intervention for periodontal disease in patients with cirrhosis. A statement by the American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons suggests that a platelet count of 40 000 cells/mm³ and an INR of 2.5 or lower are considered safe thresholds for tooth extractions in patients with cirrhosis. At these thresholds, if bleeding complications arise, they can typically be managed with local compression. In patients with severe liver disease awaiting LT, the focus of treatment should be on controlling infections and completing necessary extractions. More invasive procedures, unless they pose an immediate infectious risk, may be deferred until after transplantation. Prophylactic antibiotics are generally not required for patients with cirrhosis undergoing dental work.

Finally, the absence of mandated oral health screening in current American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) transplantation guidelines represents a critical gap in liver transplant care, emphasising the urgent need for research to establish comprehensive dental evaluation protocols to improve patient outcomes and mitigate complications.

### Complex cystic liver lesions: classification, diagnosis, and management [^e376a1c4]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Liver abscess

Pyogenic liver abscesses develop secondary to ascending cholangitis, hematogenous dissemination, or pylephlebitis following intra-abdominal infections such as acute appendicitis or diverticulitis. The incidence is higher in middle-aged or elderly patients who present with low-grade evening fever, right upper quadrant pain, fatigue, tender hepatomegaly, and elevated white blood cell count.

Infectious abscesses on contrast-enhanced CT demonstrate a peripherally enhancing rim surrounding a central low attenuation area, and then an outer low attenuation zone secondary to perilesional parenchymal edema, producing the characteristic "double target" sign. The presence of gas within an abscess is a strong indication of gas-producing species. Treatment options for pyogenic liver abscesses include antibiotic therapy and percutaneous or open drainage. Long-term antibiotic therapy alone (> 3 weeks) can be applied in patients with single small (< 3 cm) liver abscesses. Percutaneous catheter drainage combined with antibiotics has been associated with success rates exceeding 97% and more rapid clinical improvement. Ahmed et al studied 40 patients with pyogenic liver abscesses measuring > 10 cm in diameter. Percutaneous drainage was successful in 98% of patients, with 1 patient requiring subsequent open drainage and 3 patients undergoing secondary percutaneous drainage procedures. Complications (mostly minor) were observed in 25% of patients and there was 1 death. Open surgical drainage comes into play for patients who fail to respond to the above treatment, as well as in patients with peritonitis or complex, septated, and multiloculated abscesses.

Amoebic abscess is the most common extracolonic manifestation of amebiasis. Patients present with hepatomegaly, right upper quadrant pain, diarrhea, history of travel to an endemic area and positive serology. Unlike pyogenic abscesses, amoebic abscesses rarely need therapeutic drainage and are quite effectively managed with oral metronidazole administered for 7–10 days. Percutaneous or surgical drainage may be necessary in up to 15% of cases, to manage enlarging superficial abscesses (with high risk of rupture), bacterial superinfections, or when metronidazole treatment fails.

Candida abscesses are usually encountered in immune-compromised patients. CT scans show multiple low-attenuation lesions, with a typical enhancing rim and frequent involvement of the spleen. In patients who fail to improve after drainage and broad-spectrum antibiotics, antimycotic therapy should be considered early, before the onset of fungemia.

### Liver abscess and bacteremia caused by lactobacillus: role of probiotics? Case report and review of the literature [^b3a76d80]. BMC Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Lactobacilli are facultative anaerobic, non-spore forming, lactic acid producing, and Gram positive bacilli. They are found in the normal microbiota of the oral cavity, gastrointestinal tract, and female genitourinary tract. Although lactobacilli are generally considered non-pathogenic microbes and some of their strains are utilized as probiotics to prevent and treat some infections, they have been implicated in some serious clinical infections including bacteremia, infective endocarditis, intra-abdominal abscess including liver abscess, pancreatic necrosis infection, pulmonary infections, pyelonephritis, meningitis, postpartum endometritis, and chorioamnionitis.

The most common risk factors for lactobacilli infections that have been reported in the literature are diabetes mellitus, pre-existing structural heart disease (in infective endocarditis cases), cancer (especially leukemia), total parenteral nutrition use, broad spectrum antibiotic use, chronic kidney disease, inflammatory bowel disease, pancreatitis, chemotherapy, neutropenia, organ transplantation (especially liver transplantation), HIV infection and steroids use. The most common predisposing events are dental manipulation, poor dental hygiene, intravenous drug abuse, abdominal surgery, colonoscopy, probiotics use, and heavy dairy product consumption.

The antibiotic susceptibility of lactobacilli is variable. The most common regimens that have been used to treat lactobacilli are high dose penicillin and ampicillin with or without aminoglycosides. In a retrospective study of 45 cases of lactobacilli bacteremia, the bacteria were susceptible to ampicillin (100%), penicillin (96%), clindamycin (100%), erythromycin (100%), and gentamycin (67%), with high resistance rate to vancomycin (73% were resistant). Due to rarity of the infections with this microbe, clinical experience and studies are lacking regarding the best antibiotic regimens.

The incidence of serious infections caused by lactobacilli is generally uncommon and rare with liver abscess with only 7 reported cases in the literature. A previous case of liver abscess caused by a lactobacillus strain (indistinguishable from the strain used in food preparation) has been reported. In that case, there was a four month history of excessive dairy products consumption before the development of liver abscess with no use of probiotics. The association between liver abscess and use of probiotics containing lactobacilli has not been reported previously.

In this paper, we describe a case of liver abscess due to lactobacillus strain in an elderly diabetic woman with end stage renal disease after using probiotics containing lactobacilli in a course of treatment of Clostridium difficile colitis and review the literature. We followed CARE reporting guidelines in publishing our case report.

### Guidelines for complicated urinary tract infections in children: a review by the European society for pediatric infectious diseases [^22ac25a0]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

For children with multiple recurrent UTI, starting with IV antibiotics is not obligatory. Each episode should be managed according to presentation. This group is at risk of infection with antibiotic-resistant bacteria through increased antibiotic exposure. If a child has previously had a UTI with bacteria resistant to all oral options, initial antibiotics can be IV until culture results are available. Intravesical antibiotics, via the urethra or Mitrofanoff, are occasionally used to treat intractable recurrent UTI, with small studies showing successful outcomes with 7 days of treatment. Local irrigation may limit systemic antibiotic side effects and keep children out of hospital.

UTI with fever alone can be effectively treated with oral antibiotics. Severe clinical presentations of UTI requiring initial IV include sepsis (features include hypotension and tachycardia when afebrile) and extensive parenchymal involvement. Vomiting can be a sign of sepsis, but on its own is rarely a reason to start IV: in an observational study, over 60% of children with vomiting were successfully treated with oral antibiotics. For extensive renal parenchymal involvement (nephronia/abscess), IV antibiotics ensure maximum concentration at the site.

Nonurologic underlying conditions are renal and nonrenal. A review of UTI postrenal transplant recommended initial IV antibiotics for pyelonephritis to achieve rapid tissue saturation. Although there is a lack of studies of UTI management with other renal impairment, in the absence of severe VUR, oral antibiotics can usually be used. For immunocompromised children, treatment should be via febrile neutropenia pathways if relevant. Otherwise, unless presenting severely unwell, oral antibiotics may be appropriate in immunosuppression or other states of chronic disease (eg, diabetes and liver disease).

For neonates and infants < 2 months, there are no RCTs and little comparative evidence to definitively guide the route of antibiotics for UTI. Major guidelines recommend IV antibiotics due to suboptimal enteral absorption, immune immaturity and high risk of bacteremia. The only study of oral antibiotics in infants that included this age group had too few < 2 months to make strong recommendations supporting this. Most retrospective studies of UTI in neonatesand infants < 2 months – used initial IV antibiotics, and until there is any evidence to the contrary, this continues to be the recommendation, at least as the initial route.

### Short versus long-course antibiotic therapy for pyogenic liver abscess: an emulated target trial [^4d55418c]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives

The optimal treatment duration for pyogenic liver abscess (PLA) is still a matter of debate, with no comparative study to date. The present study aimed to compare short and long treatment duration in hospitalized adult patients with PLA.

Methods

We retrospectively included patients with PLA between 2010 and 2022. Exposure was defined as short (≤ 30 days) or long (> 30 days) antibiotic regimen. We applied the target trial framework with cloning, censoring and weighting. Primary outcome was difference in relapse-free survival 90 days after antibiotic initiation. We defined a non-inferiority margin of 10%.

Results

Of 429 patients with PLA, 259 had a short and 170 a long observed treatment duration. A total of 118 events were observed. The weighted risk difference (RD) in relapse-free survival between long and short treatment arm was -0.4% (95% CI: -5.9 to 4.9%), meeting the non-inferiority margin. In undrained patients, the RD was -5.0% (95% CI: -15 to 5.7%), while among drained patients, the RD was 4.6% (95% CI: -4.4 to 13.5%) in favor of short duration, achieving statistical significance for non-inferiority for drained patients only. For overall survival, the weighted RD was -1.1% (95% CI: -5.9 to 3.4%), and for relapse, -0.2% (95% CI: -7.0 to 6.3%).

Conclusion

In our study, an antibiotic course of ≤ 30 days did meet the non-inferiority threshold of 10% at 90 days compared to longer durations for relapse-free survival. Non-inferiority was also met in the subgroup of drained patients but not in undrained patients.

### Liver abscesses: pathogenesis, treatment, and ongoing challenges [^d154a692]. Infection and Immunity (2025). Medium credibility.

RISK FACTORS

While KLAs frequently occur in immunocompetent individuals, certain host factors increase the risk of developing these infections. Diabetes mellitus is a primary risk factor for KLA, but not for liver abscesses caused by other organisms. The link between diabetes and KLA is unclear, but neutrophils from patients with poor glycemic control show reduced phagocytosis of K. pneumoniae strains with K1 and K2 capsule types compared to non-diabetic patients, which could potentially aid initial infection. Fatty liver disease has also been more strongly associated with KLA compared to liver abscesses caused by other pathogens. Further studies are needed to clarify how these co-morbidities affect hvKp pathogenesis.

The higher prevalence of cases among individuals of Asian descent in endemic regions is generally attributed to colonization patterns rather than specific genetic predispositions to KLA. Reports from Western countries often associate KLA cases in individuals of Asian descent with prior travel or immigration from endemic areas, supporting the idea that regional hvKp exposure, rather than genetic ancestry, is the primary factor.

Antibiotic use may elevate the risk of developing KLA, as suggested by both clinical and experimental evidence. A retrospective study in Taiwan found that recent ampicillin or amoxicillin therapy (within the past 30 days) significantly increased the likelihood of KLA. Complementary animal studies demonstrated that administering ampicillin to hvKp-colonized mice heightened their susceptibility to liver abscess formation. Another complementary animal study demonstrated that antibiotic treatment altered the host microbiota and resulted in a temporary increase in hvKp shedding in the feces. This study suggests that antibiotic treatment could increase host-to-host transmission of hvKp through the fecal-oral route. However, stool colonization does not always correspond to the strains found in liver abscesses. For example, a Korean study revealed that only 27% of K1 and K2 KLA cases had matching strains in stool and abscess samples, suggesting that KLAs may also originate from sources other than the gut. In contrast, studies suggest that gastrointestinal carriage of cKp is a major risk factor for subsequent infection, where up to 45%–80% of infecting strains are typically found in the gut. The Korean study was limited by its sample size (37 patients) and focus on a specific geographic population, but it nonetheless highlights the possibility of extraintestinal sources. Supporting this, emerging evidence indicates that environmental reservoirs, such as contaminated water, soil, sewage, and food, could also serve as a source of exposure.

### Metronidazole oral (Likmez) [^6068c585]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

1.3 Anaerobic Bacterial Infections

LIKMEZ is indicated in the treatment of the following serious infections caused by susceptible anaerobic bacteria in adults:

Intra-abdominal infections, including peritonitis, intra-abdominal abscess, and liver abscess, caused by Bacteroides species including the B. fragilis group (B. fragilis, B. ovatus, B. thetaiotaomicron, B. vulgatus), Parabacteroides distasonis, Clostridium species, Eubacterium species, Peptococcus species, and Peptostreptococcus species.
Skin and skin structure infections caused by Bacteroides species including the B. fragilis group, Clostridium species, Peptococcus species, Peptostreptococcus species, and Fusobacterium species.
Gynecologic infections, including endometritis, endomyometritis, tubo-ovarian abscess, and postsurgical vaginal cuff infection, caused by Bacteroides species including the B. fragilis group, Clostridium species, Peptococcus species, Peptostreptococcus species, and Fusobacterium species.
Bacterial septicemia caused by Bacteroides species including the B. fragilis group and Clostridium s pecies.
Bone and joint infections, (as adjunctive therapy), caused by Bacteroides species including the B. fragilis group.
Central nervous system (CNS) infections, including meningitis and brain abscess, caused by Bacteroides species including the B. fragilis group.
Lower respiratory tract infections, including pneumonia, empyema, and lung abscess, caused by Bacteroides species including the B. fragilis group.
Endocarditis caused by Bacteroides species including the B. fragilis group.

Indicated surgical procedures should be performed in conjunction with LIKMEZ therapy. In a mixed aerobic and anaerobic infection, antimicrobials appropriate for the treatment of aerobic infection should be used in addition to LIKMEZ.

1.4 Usage

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of LIKMEZ and other antibacterial drugs, LIKMEZ should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.

### Tracking the foreign body, a rare cause of hepatic abscess [^44455cb5]. BMC Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Despite the sensitivity of CT, pre-operative diagnosis remains poor in recent reviews, averaging 25%. When a liver abscess is diagnosed, the presence of a foreign object as the source of the infection should be suspected if, in the previous 3 months, the patient has complained of epigastralgias of unknown origin or has had hematemesis, or if the patient shows more than one of the following characteristics: left lobe liver abscess, single location, no comorbidities, failure of antibiotic-based treatment, indirect signs of foreign object perforation on CT (thickened gastrointestinal walls, fistulous tract), or adherences between the liver and the gastrointestinal tract during surgery.

Treatment consists of culture-guided antibiotherapy, drainage, abcess and laparotomy for fishbone removal followed if necessary by the perforation site repair. Germs responsible for abscess formation are typically found in the normal flora of the human oral cavity, or alternatively those of the lower gut flora. Wide-spectrum antibiotics should be initiated on presentation; then guided by culture of aspirates. A conservative approach consisting of radiological-guided percutaneous aspiration and drainage of the abscess can be considered, but if the fishbone is not extracted, it must be regarded as an ongoing risk for organ injury and microbial colonisation.

The mortality in a recent review of 17 cases of liver abscesses secondary to fishbone perforation was 17,6%. This high mortality rate underscores the difficulty of diagnosis and the need for awareness of this rare occurrence.

### Ampicillin and amoxicillin use and the risk of Klebsiella pneumoniae liver abscess in Taiwan [^ae755abf]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Klebsiella pneumoniae liver abscess (KPLA) is prevalent in East Asia. Use of amoxicillin/ampicillin may lead to overgrowth of K. pneumoniae in the intestine and predispose to KPLA. We used an animal study and nationwide population-based database to investigate the association between ampicillin/amoxicillin use and KPLA in Taiwan.

Methods

In an animal study, ampicillin or sterile water was administered orogastrically in serotype K1 K. pneumoniae-colonized mice and the outcome was compared. We identified 855 cases with liver abscess and selected 3420 age- and sex-matched control subjects from the National Health Insurance Research Database. Conditional logistic regression was used to estimate the adjusted odds ratios (ORs) for the association between recent use of ampicillin/amoxicillin and KPLA.

Results

Ampicillin administration predisposed K. pneumoniae-colonized mice to increased bacterial burden, liver abscess and necrosis, and lethality. The population-based study showed that the adjusted OR associating the use of ampicillin/amoxicillin within the past 30 days with KPLA was 3.5 (95% confidence interval, 2.5–5.1). No association was found with use in the past 31–90 days.

Conclusions

Ampicillin/amoxicillin therapy started within the past 30 days was associated with increased risk for KPLA. We should avoid the overuse of these antibiotics to prevent undesired disease in the endemic area.

### Cryptogenic pyogenic liver abscess caused byin an immunocompetent patient [^7244b53f]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). High credibility.

Pyogenic liver abscesses are potentially fatal conditions that require prompt treatment with drainage and appropriate antimicrobial therapy. Fusobacterium necrophorum is a gram-negative rod that is found in the oral cavity, gastrointestinal tract and female genital tract. It is an extremely rare cause of liver abscess, particularly in the absence of risk factors or exposures. We describe an unusual case of a cryptogenic F. necrophorum hepatic abscess without a clear source despite extensive investigation in a young, immunocompetent patient without known risk factors or exposures for such an infection.

### Liver abscesses: pathogenesis, treatment, and ongoing challenges [^c031eff1]. Infection and Immunity (2025). Medium credibility.

ABSTRACT

Over the past 30 years, a distinct pathotype of hypervirulent Klebsiella pneumoniae (hvKp) has emerged, characterized by its ability to cause severe tissue-invasive infections, including liver abscesses in otherwise healthy individuals. Klebsiella liver abscesses (KLA) are most prevalent in East and Southeast Asia; however, their global incidence is rising, with hvKp now recognized as an important pathogen in Europe and the United States. While K. pneumoniae often colonizes the gut asymptomatically, KLAs develop when hvKp disseminates from the gut to the liver via the portal vein. Strains expressing K1 and K2 capsule types demonstrate the highest resistance to clearance by Kupffer cells, the liver resident macrophages, and are responsible for most KLA cases. KLAs present as fibrously encapsulated lesions composed of bacteria, pus, and immune cells. Treatment typically involves a combination of abscess drainage and antibiotic therapy; however, clinical outcomes are often poor, even in the absence of antibiotic resistance. This is due, in part, to significant barriers to achieving effective antibiotic efficacy within abscesses that can result in devastating complications such as metastatic infection, liver resection, or death. The emergence of KLA caused by multidrug-resistant hvKp strains, although still rare, represents an additional and alarming therapeutic challenge. This review explores the pathogenesis of KLA and highlights critical obstacles to effective management and therapy.

### Pyogenic liver abscess: is drainage always possible? [^4e4a249f]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2006). Low credibility.

The treatment of pyogenic liver abscess generally involves antibiotic therapy and radiological percutaneous drainage or aspiration. Surgical drainage is rarely advisable. We report a case of multiloculated liver abscess that was not suitable for either percutaneous drainage or open surgical drainage. The only successful approach was a left hepatectomy.

### Liver abscesses: pathogenesis, treatment, and ongoing challenges [^026cff49]. Infection and Immunity (2025). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION

Underreporting of hvKp infections remains a significant concern, in part due to the absence of standardized, accessible diagnostic tools to differentiate hvKp from classical strains in Western healthcare settings. Currently, clinical management of K. pneumoniae bacteremia appropriately prioritizes identifying an anatomic source through imaging, such as CT or ultrasound, particularly in patients with persistent fever. Despite this, emerging evidence suggests that hvKp strains are disproportionately associated with deep-seated infections, such as liver abscesses, which may otherwise go unrecognized. While no inexpensive, rapid, and reliable test for hvKp is currently available, increased clinical awareness and targeted testing where feasible, especially in patients with no clear source of bacteremia, could facilitate earlier prognosis, help prevent the development of intractable liver abscesses, and ultimately improve patient outcomes.

Although still relatively rare, the emergence of convergent hvKp strains that combine hypervirulence with antibiotic resistance pose a serious public health threat, necessitating ongoing surveillance and rapid response strategies. Preventive efforts, including risk factor management, such as controlling diabetes and fatty liver disease, as well as potential decolonization strategies, may help reduce the incidence of KLA.

Despite major advances in the basic biology of hvKp pathogenesis, critical gaps remain in our understanding of hvKp abscess development, metastatic spread, and treatment failure. The complex interplay between bacterial virulence, host immune responses, and antibiotic penetration within abscesses is not yet fully understood, highlighting the need for continued research. Addressing these challenges will be key to improving both diagnostic capabilities and therapeutic approaches, ultimately enhancing patient outcomes.

### Summary of clinical features of 1800 cases of pyogenic liver abscess [^3b1fadf3]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2025). Medium credibility.

In summary, when diagnosing and treating PLA, clinicians should continuously deepen their understanding of liver diseases. Alongside familiarizing themselves with traditional pathogens, they should remain vigilant for rare or emerging strains. It is also important to closely monitor global and regional resistance patterns and use antimicrobial agents according to guidelines to ensure effective patient treatment and prognosis. However, this study has certain limitations: the small number of liver abscess cases included may restrict the generalizability of the findings and the reliability of the statistical analysis. Due to the limited sample size, caution should be exercised when applying these findings to other populations or regions. Future research should focus on more comprehensive and detailed sample selection and study design to enhance the generalizability and applicability of the results. Additionally, although this study explored the diversity of pathogens causing PLA, it did not delve into the characteristics of different strains and their impact on treatment. Future studies should further analyze the resistance patterns and treatment outcomes of different strains.

### Management of pyogenic liver abscesses: contemporary strategies and challenges [^e4fa988b]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Pyogenic liver abscesses (PLAs) are a suppurative infection of the hepatic parenchyma responsible for significant morbidity and mortality. PLAs are categorized into a variety of mechanisms: (1) via the portal vein, (2) through the biliary tract, (3) via the hepatic artery, (4) from trauma, (5) contiguously via direct extension, and (6) cryptogenically. The pathogenesis of PLA, which informs treatment, can often be discerned based on host factors, clinical presentation, and causative microorganisms. The Streptococcus anginosus group, hypervirulent Klebsiella pneumoniae, and multidrug-resistant gram-negative pathogens have emerged as microbiologically challenging organisms to treat. The identification of hypervirulent K. pneumoniae should prompt for assessment for metastatic spread and consideration of prolonged antimicrobial treatment. Abdominal imaging is indispensable in characterizing PLAs and facilitating source control interventions. Source control remains the most critical aspect of PLA management, followed by antimicrobial therapy. Empiric antibiotics for PLAs are informed by the suspected etiology of PLA formation. Duration of antimicrobial therapy is individualized and dependent on multiple components, including the success of achieving source control, host factors, mechanism of PLA development, and the illness course of the individual-factoring in clinical, biochemical, and radiographic parameters.

### Prolonged antibiotic prophylaxis in patients with bilioenteric anastomosis undergoing percutaneous radiofrequency ablation [^44a0215d]. Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose

To reduce risk of development of a hepatic abscess in patients with preexisting bilioenteric anastomosis (BEA) undergoing radiofrequency (RF) ablation of hepatic tumors by use of prolonged antibiotic prophylaxis over at least 10 days.

Materials and Methods

Between April 2003 and June 2011, 184 patients underwent 206 percutaneous RF ablation procedures for hepatic malignancies. Eight patients presented with BEA and were treated in 10 sessions at 14 tumor locations. These 8 patients were male and ranged in age from 55–73 years. Median follow-up was 34 months. Antibiotic prophylaxis was given before the intervention (n = 9, piperacillin/tazobactam; n = 1, ciprofloxacin). Oral antibiotic prophylaxis after the intervention was continued with ciprofloxacin for at least 10 days. In four cases, prophylaxis after the intervention was extended with additional antibiotics.

Results

A liver abscess occurred 22 days after 1 of 10 RF ablation sessions in patients with preexisting BEA. The patient who developed an abscess presented with a large hepatocellular carcinoma (59 mm × 54 mm) and underwent transarterial chemoembolization 8 days before RF ablation. No hepatic abscess occurred after 196 RF ablation sessions in 176 patients without BEA.

Conclusions

Preexisting BEA is a risk factor for formation of hepatic abscesses after RF ablation. An antibiotic prophylaxis regimen before the intervention and for a prolonged period after the intervention that covers anaerobic bacteria for at least 10 days is presented. Combined therapy of transarterial chemoembolization and RF ablation increases the risk for complications in patients with known BEA.

14.3 Intestinal Amebiasis

Tinidazole use in intestinal amebiasis has been documented in 26 published reports from the world literature involving over 1,400 patients. Most reports utilized tinidazole 2 g/day × 3 days. In four published, randomized, controlled studies (1 investigator single-blind, 3 open-label) of the 2 g/day × 3 days oral dose of tinidazole, reported cure rates after 3 days of therapy among a total of 220 subjects ranged from 86% (25/29) to 93% (25/27).

14.4 Amebic Liver Abscess

Tinidazole use in amebic liver abscess has been documented in 18 published reports from the world literature involving over 470 patients. Most reports utilized tinidazole 2 g/day × 2–5 days. In seven published, randomized, controlled studies (1 double-blind, 1 single-blind, 5 open-label) of the 2 g/day × 2–5 days oral dose of tinidazole accompanied by aspiration of the liver abscess when clinically necessary, reported cure rates among 133 subjects ranged from 81% (17/21) to 100% (16/16). Four of these studies utilized at least 3 days of tinidazole.

### KDIGO 2025 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation, management, and treatment of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) [^fdbaa7d4]. Kidney International (2025). High credibility.

Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) — management of infected liver cysts: Empirical antibiotic treatment of liver cyst infections should target gram-negative bacteria in the Enterobacteriaceae family and should be initiated with a third-generation intravenous (i.v.) cephalosporin with or without a fluoroquinolone; after clinical stabilization, i.v. therapy can be switched to an oral fluoroquinolone, with adjustment according to culture results when available. Duration of antibiotic therapy should be ≥ 4 weeks for liver cyst infection. Percutaneous drainage of infected liver cysts < 48 hours after initiation of antibiotics may be reasonable when there is isolation of pathogens that are unresponsive to antibiotic therapy from a cyst aspirate, immunocompromise in the patient, large infected hepatic cysts (> 8 cm), or hemodynamic instability and/or signs of sepsis. Infected liver cysts that do not respond to 48–72 hours of antibiotic treatment should be evaluated further, placement of a percutaneous drain should be considered for failure to improve, worsening symptoms, or presence of the risk factors listed, the drain should be kept in place until drainage stops, and in the case of deep cysts for which percutaneous drainage is not feasible, surgical drainage may be necessary.

Antibiotic treatment leads to the development of thesupershedder phenotype.

Given that the fecal-oral route of transmission in a hospital setting is considered a significant cause of nosocomial infections, it was surprising that the MKP103 isolate failed to colonize the GI tract in mice (Fig. 2A). However, as many of the patients that acquired MKP103 in the GI tract were on antibiotics, we considered whether the use of antibiotics would affect the ability of this isolate to colonize the GI tract. Moreover, high use of antibiotics in a health care setting correlates withinfections. Therefore, mice were treated with neomycin by gavage to reduce the colonization resistance by the host GI microbiota and then infected with MKP103 to determine whether antibiotic treatment positively affected its ability to colonize. As shown in Fig. 2B, antibiotic pretreatment of mice allowed MKP103 to colonize and persist within the infected host GI tract up to 15 days postinfection.

### Image-guided percutaneous procedure plus metronidazole versus metronidazole alone for uncomplicated amoebic liver abscess [^26d0da6f]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Metronidazole is the standard of care for uncomplicated amoebic liver abscesses (considering that complicated liver abscesses are those localized in left lobe, multiple, and/or pyogenic abscesses). However, a subset of patients with amoebic liver abscesses remain symptomatic, with a significant risk of rupture of the abscess into the peritoneum. The role of image-guided percutaneous therapeutic aspiration in these patients remains controversial.

Objectives

To assess the beneficial and harmful effects of image-guided percutaneous procedure plus metronidazole versus metronidazole alone in patients with uncomplicated amoebic liver abscess.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials in The Cochrane Library (Issue 2, 2007), MEDLINE (1966 to November 2007), EMBASE (1988 to September 2007), and Science Citation Index Expanded (1945 to September 2007).

Selection Criteria

Randomised or quasi-randomised trials comparing an image-guided percutaneous procedure plus metronidazole versus metronidazole alone in patients with uncomplicated amoebic liver abscess.

Data Collection and Analysis

Inclusion criteria, trial quality assessment, and data extraction were done in duplicate. We calculated relative risks (RR) and mean differences, and checked for heterogeneity by visual inspection of forest plots and chi-squared and I(2) tests.

Main Results

Seven low quality randomised trials were included. All studies included a total of 310 patients, but due to selective outcome reporting bias, less patients could be included in our analyses. Pooled analysis of three homogenous trials showed that needle aspiration did not significantly increase the proportion of patients with fever resolution (RR 0.60, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.22 to 1.61). Sensitivity analysis according to trial quality preserved these findings. Trials that evaluated resolution of abdominal pain, days to resolution of fever, pain, resolution of abscess cavities, reduction in liver size, and duration of hospitalisation were heterogeneous. The benefits in the number of days to resolution of pain (MD -1.59, 95%CI -2.73 to -0.42), number of days to resolution of abdominal tenderness (MD -1.70, 95%CI -2.86 to -0.54), and duration of hospitalisation (MD -1.31, 95%CI -2.05 to -0.57) were observed in the needle aspiration group only.

Authors' Conclusions

Therapeutic aspiration in addition to metronidazole to hasten clinical or radiologic resolution of uncomplicated amoebic liver abscesses cannot be supported or refuted by the present evidence. The trials lack methodological rigour and adequate sample size to conclude on the presence of effectiveness of adjunctive image-guided aspiration plus metronidazole versus metronidazole alone. Further randomised trials are necessary.

### Is It safe to remove teeth in liver transplant patients without antibiotics? A retrospective study of 346 patients [^0867306f]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Eradication of oral infectious foci is essential for liver transplant candidates. The main issue is whether antibiotic prophylaxis is necessary for all dental extractions despite the possible fostering of resistant bacteria. To overcome the scarcity of evidence-based data, our study analyzed the background and outcomes of a large number of routine extractions performed in our institution without antibiotic prophylaxis in patients with different liver pathologies.

Materials and Methods

In this retrospective cohort study, the outcome of interest was the occurrence of local infections and minor complications during the 7-day follow-up period after extraction; the predictors were the demographic and clinical variables of the patients (age, gender, liver pathology, Model for End-Stage Liver Disease score, international normalized ratio) and the extraction variables (single vs multiple extractions, isolated vs contiguous teeth, single-rooted vs multirooted teeth). The statistical analysis used univariate nonparametric tests and binary multivariate logistic regressions.

Results

The 346 liver transplant candidates (mean age, 53 ± 8 years; 24% women) underwent 662 routine extraction sessions involving 1,329 teeth. The 7-day dental follow-up detected no signs of postoperative wound infection (rate = 0% [95% confidence interval (CI), 0 to 0.9%]). Accordingly, the 2-week post-extraction clinical monitoring excluded symptoms of systemic infection attributable to the dental procedure. Minor complications (mild bleeding, slow healing, inflamed socket) occurred in 50 patients (rate = 14% [95% CI, 11 to 18%]) in the 3 days after extraction. Significant risk factors for minor complications were refractory ascites (P < .0001; OR = 8 [95% CI, 3 to 20]), extraction of multirooted contiguous teeth (P < 0.0001; OR = 5 [95% CI, 2.5 to 9]), and a Model for End-Stage Liver Disease score greater than 18 (P = 0.01; OR = 2.4 [95% CI, 1.2 to 5]).

Conclusions

Our study showed that routine extractions without antibiotic prophylaxis can be performed safely in liver transplant candidates, even in the presence of 1 or more non-controllable risk factors. Using atraumatic techniques, we achieved satisfactory healing of the gingiva and socket in all patients in a week, without any signs of local infection. The few minor complications were readily managed and resolved within 3 days after extraction.

### Clinical characteristics and management of liver abscess in the Gambia, a resource-limited country [^7914e3aa]. BMC Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

This retrospective cohort study conducted in the Gambia, a low-resource country, found that liver abscess predominantly affects mostly males with clinical, laboratory, and radiological features consistent with late presentation. In spite of this and the lack of diagnostic and material resources, morbidity and mortality rates in this cohort were low. This suggests that the current strategy of antibiotic therapy combined with percutaneous abscess drainage is a reasonable treatment strategy for the management of liver abscess in resource-poor settings.

We suggest use of oral amoxicillin–clavulanic acid as an acceptable regimen for adults and children older than one month (Grade 2-B). We suggest use of oral moxifloxacin as an acceptable regimen for adults (Grade 2-B), and we do not recommend the use of oral moxifloxacin for the treatment of IAI in children, unless no other option is available (Grade 1-B). We recommend use of oral ciprofloxacin plus metronidazole as an acceptable regimen for adults (Grade 1-B), and we suggest that oral ciprofloxacin plus metronidazole may be used in children older than one month, if other options are not suitable (Grade 2-B). We suggest that oral levofloxacin plus metronidazole, an oral first-, second-, or third-generation cephalosporin plus metronidazole, or oral trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole plus metronidazole are potential regimens that could be used selectively to complete a short course of antibiotic therapy in adults and children older than one month, if other oral agents are not suitable (Grade 2-C).

Oral antimicrobial agents in intra-abdominal infection — switching from intravenous therapy: An accepted principle of antimicrobial stewardship is the conversion from IV to oral anti-infective agents when the patient's condition permits, and although oral agents are often not feasible immediately after source control because of gastrointestinal intolerance, it is often possible to switch later once gastrointestinal function returns. A number of randomized controlled trials have permitted use of oral antibiotics as a substitute for IV antibiotics, though only a few directly tested equivalence; in one older randomized study, oral ciprofloxacin plus metronidazole was permitted as continuation therapy and outcomes were similar to exclusive IV therapy.

### Treatment of liver abscess: prospective randomized comparison of catheter drainage and needle aspiration [^c57f4a4b]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

A liver abscess is a suppurative cavity in the liver resulting from the invasion and multiplication of microorganisms, entering directly from an injury through the blood vessels or by the way of the biliary ductal system. Liver abscesses are most commonly due to pyogenic, amebic or mixed infections. Less commonly these may be fungal in origin.

Liver abscess has been recognized since Hippocrates (circa 400 B.C.) who speculated that the prognoses of the patients were related to the type of fluid within the abscess cavity. Although amebic liver abscess occurs more commonly on a worldwide basis, the pyogenic liver abscess predominates in the United States.

Liver abscess is found more commonly in men between 20 and 40 years of age, but can occur at any age. Approximately 60% are solitary and mainly located in the right lobe of the liver, as a result of the streaming of portal blood flow secondary to the fact that the right lobe is predominantly supplied by the superior mesenteric vein, and because most of the hepatic volume is in the right lobe. When multiple abscesses are present, pyogenic or mixed is the most probable type. Patients usually present with a constant dull pain in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen which may be referred to the scapular region or the right shoulder. These patients usually have fever of between 38 o C and 40 o C.

Liver abscesses, both amebic and pyogenic, continue to be an important cause of morbidity and mortality in tropical countries. However, recent advances in interventional radiology, intensive care, progress in antibiotic therapy, and liberal use of sonography and computerized tomography scanning of the abdomen have led to early diagnosis and treatment of patients with liver abscess, thus improving the patient outcome. Percutaneous drainage of liver abscess has been an important advancement in the treatment of pyogenic liver abscesses.

The primary mode of treatment of amebic liver abscess is medical; however as many as 15% of amebic abscesses may be refractory to medical therapy. Also, secondary bacterial infection may complicate 20% of amebic liver abscesses. In such patients and in patients with pyogenic liver abscesses, surgical drainage has been the traditional mode of treatment. However, operative drainage is associated with significant (10–47%) morbidity and mortality.

### Oral antibiotic prophylaxis reduces spontaneous bacterial peritonitis occurrence and improves short-term survival in cirrhosis: a meta-analysis [^fbfcdf28]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2009). Low credibility.

Objectives

Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) is a serious complication of advanced liver disease resulting in high mortality rates. Although studies that assessed the use of oral antibiotics in advanced liver disease demonstrated a clear benefit in reducing the risk of recurrent peritonitis, it is unclear whether mortality rates are similarly affected by this practice. The goal of this study was to determine whether oral antibiotic therapy provides a survival benefit for patients with advanced cirrhosis and ascites. Through subgroup analysis, we also evaluated the effect of prophylactic oral antibiotic therapy on the prevention of SBP and the incidence of all infections (including SBP) when compared with non-treated or placebo controls.

Methods

We conducted a comprehensive search of the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, MEDLINE (1966 to May 2008), bibliographies of retrieved trials, and reports presented at major scientific meetings. Eligible studies included prospective, randomized controlled trials comparing high-risk cirrhotic patients receiving oral antibiotic prophylaxis for SBP with groups receiving placebo or no intervention. Dichotomous outcomes were reported as relative risk (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).

Results

Eight studies with a total of 647 patients were identified and included in this analysis. The combined analysis showed an overall mortality benefit (RR = 0.65; 95% CI, 0.48–0.88) for treatment groups. The overall mortality rate was 16% (52/324) for treated patients and 25% (81/323) for the control group. Groups treated with prophylactic antibiotics also demonstrated a lower incidence of all infections (including SBP) of 6.2% as compared with the control groups with a rate of 22.2% (RR = 0.32; P < 0.00001; 95% CI, 0.20–0.51). Subgroup analysis showed a survival benefit at 3 months (RR = 0.28; P = 0.005; 95% CI, 0.12–0.68).

Conclusions

Antibiotic prophylaxis improved short-term survival in treated patients when compared with untreated control groups and reduced the overall risk of infections, including SBP, during follow-up. In summary, antibiotic prophylaxis should be considered for high-risk cirrhotic patients with ascites.

### Clinical characteristics and management of liver abscess in the Gambia, a resource-limited country [^5a7ad181]. BMC Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

d) Treatment

Antibiotic therapy contributes a crucial role in the management of liver abscess. In this study, only 16.7% of patients (5/30) were exclusively treated with antibiotics (ciprofloxacillin or ceftriaxone and/or metronidazole). The majority of the patients had both ultrasound-assisted percutaneous needle aspiration and antibiotics (25 patients, 83.3%). This is different from developed countries where pigtail catheters are readily available and are used. None of the patients had complications related to percutaneous needle aspiration. Percutaneous needle aspiration combined with antibiotics appears to be a safe, effective, and promising treatment for pyogenic liver abscess of 3–6 cm in size. Other studies have also found percutaneous catheter drainage to be more effective than percutaneous needle aspiration. None of the patients underwent surgical operations. Outcome of open surgical drainage is found to be worse when compared with percutaneous drainage.

e) Patients outcomes

The total mortality in this study was 3.3% (1 patient). The rest of the patients recovered fully. The patient who died had multiple, bilobular, pyogenic liver abscesses due to Staphylococcus aureus infection. Studies have reported a mortality rate of 2.8% in Thailand and 12.3% in UK. Deaths within 2 years of follow-up for ALA was found to be 3.33% in Bangladesh and in hospital mortality for PLA was 2.2% in South Korea. In another study, there were no mortalities for ALA but the 30-day mortality for pyogenic liver abscess was 5.3%.

The presence of weight loss, a longer median duration of symptoms, hypoalbuminaemia and giant liver abscess (abscess size ≥ 10 cm) in the majority of patients at presentation suggest that most of the patients with liver abscess present late. The reasons for this could be related to 1) delay in the community as most patients visit herbalist as first point of contact before visiting health facilities 2) The lack of specialist services (e.g. trained personnel, imaging services) in the primary and secondary health facilities which can result in miss diagnosis of patients liver abscess and 3) delay in health facilities before referring to tertiary facility due to inadequate referral protocol and guideline. The findings in this study further suggest that in resource-limited countries where advanced imaging techniques and modern treatment modalities for liver abscess are limited or unavailable, ultrasound-assisted percutaneous needle aspiration combined with antibiotic treatment still remains effective and safe in the treatment of liver abscess.

### Effectiveness of an aggressive antibiotic regimen for chemoembolization in patients with previous biliary intervention [^7d1f51b6]. Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose

Liver abscess occurs in most patients with biliary stents or bypass undergoing chemoembolization despite the use of standard prophylactic antibiotics. The present study was conducted to investigate the efficacy of an aggressive prophylactic regimen to prevent abscess in such patients.

Materials and Methods

Between November 2002 and July 2005, 16 chemoembolization procedures were performed in seven patients who had undergone biliary intervention. Prophylaxis was initiated with levofloxacin 500 mg daily and metronidazole 500 mg twice daily 2 days before chemoembolization and continued for 2 weeks after discharge. A bowel preparation regimen was given with neomycin 1 g plus erythromycin base 1 g orally at 1 p.m., 2 p.m., and 11 p. m. the day before chemoembolization. With the Fisher exact test, the incidence of infectious complications was compared with previously reported data for patients with and without earlier biliary intervention who had received standard prophylaxis.

Results

Liver abscess occurred in two of seven patients after two of 16 procedures. Previously reported incidences were six of seven patients (P = 0.103) and six of 14 procedures (P = 0.101) among patients with previous biliary intervention receiving standard prophylaxis and one of 150 patients (P = 0.005) and one of 383 procedures (P = 0.004) among patients with no previous biliary intervention.

Conclusions

There was a trend toward a lower rate of abscess formation among patients at high risk who received more aggressive antibiotic prophylaxis, but the difference did not reach statistical significance. The rate of infection remained significantly higher than among patients without previous biliary intervention.

### Risk factors for liver abscess formation after hepatic chemoembolization [^72d73b54]. Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2001). Low credibility.

Purpose

To assess the frequency and risk factors for liver abscess after hepatic chemoembolization.

Materials and Methods

The authors performed retrospective analysis of 397 chemoembolization procedures in 157 patients. All patients received prophylactic intravenous antibiotics before the procedure and 5 days of oral antibiotics after the procedure. The association between abscess formation and risk factors was determined with use of chi(2) analysis and the Fisher exact test and expressed as an odds ratio.

Results

Liver abscess occurred in seven of 157 patients (4.5%) after eight of 397 procedures (2.0%) at a mean of 19 d ± 7 after chemoembolization. No patients had neutropenia. Organisms isolated reflected intestinal flora. Six patients required percutaneous drainage for 35 d ± 29. The seventh patient required drainage for the remainder of life as a result of a nonhealing biliary fistula. Three of 24 patients with neuroendocrine tumors had abscesses (12.5%; odds ratio, 4.6; 95% CI, 0.96–22.1; P = 0.07), as did three of 14 patients with gastrointestinal sarcomas (21%; odds ratio, 9.5; 95% CI, 1.9–47.8; P = 0.016), and one of two with pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Six of the seven patients with abscesses underwent a Whipple procedure before chemoembolization. Only one patient with a history of a Whipple procedure did not develop an hepatic abscess. In the absence of a bilioenteric anastomosis, abscess occurred in only one of 150 patients (0.7%), or one of 383 procedures (0.3%). The odds ratio for liver abscess among patients with a bilioenteric anastomosis was 894 (95% CI, 50–16,000; P < .0001).

Conclusion

Earlier bilioenteric anastomosis is the major determinant of liver abscess formation after hepatic chemoembolization. The prophylaxis regimen used failed to prevent abscess formation in patients with earlier bilioenteric anastomosis.

### Liver abscesses: pathogenesis, treatment, and ongoing challenges [^bc14c361]. Infection and Immunity (2025). Medium credibility.

EPIDEMIOLOGY

Until the 1980s, Escherichia coli was the leading cause of pyogenic liver abscesses (PLAs) worldwide. In 1986 in Taiwan, hvKp was first identified as the cause of several cases of liver abscesses and septic endophthalmitis. Since then, the prevalence of KLAs has increased and now accounts for up to 80% of PLAs in East and Southeast Asia. In North America and Europe, hvKp is estimated to cause ~10%–20% of PLAs, but incidence is also rising in these regions.

Surveillance

K. pneumoniae strains are classified into sequence types (ST) based on variations in housekeeping gene sequences. These STs are used to track their lineage as well as virulence and resistance traits. CKp strains increasingly display multi-drug resistant (MDR) phenotypes, such as the production of extended-spectrum beta β-lactamases (ESBLs) or carbapenemases. High-risk MDR clones, such as those from ST258 and ST307, are frequent causes of nosocomial infections and hospital outbreaks. Although these strains exhibit low virulence in animal models, their multidrug resistance poses a significant threat to immunocompromised patients, with mortality rates in patients reaching as high as 50%.

The dominant lineage of hvKp is ST23, which is responsible for approximately 80% of KLA cases. HvKp strains are traditionally susceptible to almost all classes of antibiotics, except ampicillin due to chromosome encoding narrow-spectrum β-lactamase SHV gene. Despite the drug susceptibility displayed by these strains in vitro, treatment failure of KLAs is common, and this will be discussed in detail in a later section.

### Is antibiotic prophylaxis for percutaneous radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of primary liver tumors necessary? Results from a single-center experience [^e7c7e413]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose

The purpose of this study was to evaluate need for antibiotic prophylaxis for radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of liver tumors in patients with no significant co-existing risk factors for infection.

Materials and Methods

From January 2004 to September 2013, 83 patients underwent 123 percutaneous RFA procedures for total of 152 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) lesions. None of the patients had pre-existing biliary enteric anastomosis (BEA) or any biliary tract abnormality predisposing to ascending biliary infection or uncontrolled diabetes mellitus. No pre- or post-procedure antibiotic prophylaxis was provided for 121 procedures. Data for potential risk factors were reviewed retrospectively and analyzed for the frequency of infectious complications, including abscess formation.

Results

One patient (1/121 (0.8%) RFA sessions) developed a large segment 5 liver abscess/infected biloma communicating with the gallbladder 7 weeks after the procedure, successfully treated over 10 weeks with IV and PO antibiotic therapy and percutaneous catheter drainage. This patient did not receive any antibiotics prior to RFA. During the procedure, there was inadvertent placement of RFA probe tines into the gallbladder. No other infectious complications were documented.

Conclusion

These data suggest that the routine use of prophylactic antibiotics for liver RFA is not necessary in majority of the patients undergoing liver ablation for HCC and could be limited to patients with high-risk factors such as the presence of BEA or other biliary abnormalities, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, and large centrally located tumors in close proximity to central bile ducts. Larger randomized studies are needed to confirm this hypothesis.

### Intravenous versus intravenous / oral antibiotics for perforated appendicitis in pediatric patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^b123d9ef]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Postoperative abscess is a main complication of perforated appendicitis and developed in approximately 12% of the patients with perforated appendicitis. Postoperative antibiotic therapy can decrease the risk of abscess, and the optimal administration route is usually thought to be IV. In this meta-analysis, the result indicates that the IV/PO route is as effective as the IV route in terms of preventing an abscess. Moreover, it has been reported that PO antibiotics treating already-formed abscesses achieved equivalent outcomes as IV antibiotics. Thus, conversion to PO may be initiated when the patient tolerates an oral diet.

Wound infection is also a common complication of perforated appendicitis, with a prevalence of approximately 17%. Previously, some investigators suggested that wounds should be left open in the presence of perforated appendicitis to avoid an increased likelihood of wound infection and longer hospital stay and cost. A growing number of studies indicated that primary wound closure after appendectomy would be safe even in cases of perforated or gangrenous appendicitis. In addition, wound infections may also be reduced by using antibiotic therapy. Our study shows that the use of IV/PO antibiotics is noninferior to IV antibiotics with regard to wound infection. In the past, intravenous injection of antibiotics was widely used to treat infectious disease due to a lack of appropriate oral antibiotics. With the development of medical therapy, more broad-spectrum oral antibiotics have been created. Thus, more studies should be conducted to investigate whether PO antibiotics could be used to treat reflux cholangitis or other severe infectious diseases that require long courses of antibiotics.

### Liver abscesses: pathogenesis, treatment, and ongoing challenges [^fae3f563]. Infection and Immunity (2025). Medium credibility.

INTERVENTION

Standard of care

KLAs are commonly identified using a CT scan or ultrasound imaging combined with K. pneumoniae culture from abscess aspirate or blood. Treatment involves systemic antibiotic therapy, which is customized based on the results of in vitro antibiotic susceptibility testing. In addition to antibiotics, drainage of the liver abscess is often recommended although the location of the abscess can significantly impact the patient's risk. For instance, a study examining six case reports of patients with KLAs found that five of the patients successfully underwent percutaneous drainage. In some cases, abscesses located beneath the diaphragm may be difficult or impossible to drain safely, as attempts could pose a significant risk of complications such as pneumothorax. Additionally, KLAs often present as large, multiloculated abscesses with hypermucoviscous consistency that poses challenges for effective drainage using standard needle aspiration techniques. Incomplete drainage can lead to persistent infections, an increased likelihood of complications such as the formation of new abscesses, bacteremia, metastatic infection, or even death.

### Novel presentation and approach to management of hepatopulmonary syndrome with use of antimicrobial agents [^8ebfff17]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

A 44-year-old man with hepatitis C-associated liver cirrhosis, cyanosis, digital clubbing, and platypnea presented with left-side hemiplegia found to be due to a brain abscess. Hepatopulmonary syndrome was diagnosed after demonstration of the presence of a massive intrapulmonary shunt. Although the anomalous vascular channel never was defined anatomically, follow-up studies confirmed the presence of a functional shunt. Culture of a sample from the abscess yielded Streptococcus intermedius. It was hypothesized that the patient's pulmonary vascular pathology was due, in large part, to chronic elevated levels of nitric oxide (a potent vasodilator thought to be generated by endotoxin absorbed from the gut). Treatment with oral norfloxacin was initiated on the basis of data that this antibiotic reduces endotoxemia and concomitant nitric oxide production in patients with cirrhosis. Four months after initiation of treatment, the patient's hypoxia had resolved.

### Association between prophylactic antibiotic use for transarterial chemoembolization and occurrence of liver abscess: a retrospective cohort study [^0899fd56]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Clinical evidence on prophylactic antibiotics for transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) to prevent liver abscess is limited because liver abscess is a rare event. This study aimed to analyse the association between prophylactic antibiotic use for TACE and the occurrence of liver abscess after TACE.

Methods

Using the nationwide Diagnosis Procedure Combination database in Japan, we retrospectively identified patients who underwent TACE for hepatic cancer between July 2010 and March 2017. The primary outcome was liver abscess requiring procedural intervention within 30 days of TACE. Secondary outcomes included 30-day in-hospital mortality and length of stay. Propensity score matching was performed to adjust for potential confounding factors and compare outcomes between patients with and without prophylactic antibiotics.

Results

Among 167 544 eligible patients, 134 712 received antibiotics and 32 832 did not. In the matched cohort of 29 211 pairs, the proportion of patients with liver abscess requiring procedural intervention was significantly lower in the antibiotics group than in the no-antibiotics group (0.08% vs. 0.22%, p 0.001; relative risk (95% confidence interval), 0.35 (0.22–0.57); absolute risk reduction, 0.0014 (0.0008–0.0021); and number needed to treat, 696 (476–1223)). There was no significant difference in 30-day in-hospital mortality between the groups. The length of stay was longer in the antibiotics group than in the no-antibiotics group (median, 10 vs. 9 days, p < 0.001).

Conclusions

Prophylactic antibiotic use in patients undergoing TACE was associated with a reduced occurrence of liver abscess requiring procedural intervention.

ADPKD liver cyst infection — antibiotic penetration, selection, and resistance: The success of antibiotic treatment in liver cyst infections is influenced by antibiotic penetrance into the cyst; carbapenems and cefazolin penetrate poorly into liver cysts, data from kidney cysts indicate higher intracytic drug levels may be achieved with TMP-SMX, and in clinical practice the highest level of treatment efficacy is obtained with third-generation cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin); monotherapy is not always successful and combining antibiotics may lead to superior outcomes, resistance patterns vary geographically and must be considered, and only systemic administration (i.v. or oral) has been studied with no investigated alternative administration methods, so physicians should be mindful of side effects including increased risk of resistance.

Amebiasis. FLAGYL 375 capsules are indicated in the treatment of acute intestinal amebiasis (amebic dysentery) and amebic liver abscess.

In amebic liver abscess, FLAGYL 375 capsules therapy does not obviate the need for aspiration or drainage of pus.

Anaerobic Bacterial Infections. FLAGYL 375 capsules are indicated in the treatment of serious infections caused by susceptible anaerobic bacteria. Indicated surgical procedures should be performed in conjunction with FLAGYL therapy. In a mixed aerobic and anaerobic infection, antimicrobials appropriate for the treatment of the aerobic infection should be used in addition to FLAGYL 375 capsules.

### Bacteraemia and multiple liver abscesses due toin a patient with oropharyngeal malignancy [^12fd7cbf]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

Fusobacterium infections can have a wide clinical spectrum, ranging from mild infections to severe sepsis and abscess formation. This range depends partly on the patient's underlying conditions, such as immunosuppression or malignancy. Fusobacteria are commensal rods in the oropharyngeal cavity and digestive tract, but should mucosal barrier disruption occur, in the presence of the above-mentioned predisposing conditions, fusobacteria can spread and cause infections in the soft tissues, liver and so on. An elderly woman was admitted with an altered level of consciousness (lethargy). The ensuing workup revealed a posterior oral cavity tumour (squamous cell carcinoma), Fusobacterium nucleatum bacteraemia and liver abscesses. Due to the severe sepsis, the patient was referred to our intensive care unit, but she passed away despite antibiotic treatment.

### Multifocal hepatic abscess post-ERCP [^4e592447]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). High credibility.

A woman in her 40s presented to hospital with cholangitis. A magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography showed a moderately dilated common bile duct and mild intrahepatic duct dilatation with sludge. She underwent a successful endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) and sphincteroplasty. She subsequently developed recurrence of fevers and abdominal pain with rising inflammatory markers. Initial investigations and imaging were unremarkable. A positron emission tomography scan demonstrated multiple fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-avid hepatic lesions, and subsequent imaging confirmed multifocal liver abscesses without a drainable collection. The patient was managed with intravenous co-amoxiclav initially before switching to oral antibiotics, however, represented 1week later with similar symptoms. Her antibiotic coverage was broadened to intravenous pipercillin-tazobactam, and she was discharged on this with follow-up in clinic. This case report highlights the rare complication of hepatic abscesses following ERCP and the importance of considering this as a differential in patients who present with sepsis following the procedure.

### Antibiotics after incision and drainage for uncomplicated skin abscesses: a clinical practice guideline [^7c69d1d9]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

The evidence

To inform the recommendations, the guideline panel requested a systematic review of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) on the effects of adjuvant antibiotic therapy compared with no antibiotic therapy in addition to incision and drainage in patients with uncomplicated skin abscesses.

A large RCT published in March 2016 suggested that TMP-SMX treatment resulted in a higher cure rate than placebo among patients with a drained cutaneous abscess. Another RCT published in June 2017 found that, compared with incision and drainage alone, clindamycin or TMP-SMX in addition to incision and drainage improved short term outcomes in patients who had an uncomplicated skin abscess. The Rapid Recommendations team believed these two trials, in addition to the existing body of evidence, might change practice.

Figure 1 gives an overview of the characteristics of patients and trials included in the systematic review of the effects of antibiotics on uncomplicated skin abscesses. There were 14 RCTs: eight included a comparison of antibiotics versus no antibiotics, and seven included a comparison of two different antibiotics. Explicit descriptions of abscess definitions, for each trial, were summarised in the accompanying systematic review (table C of appendix 2). The largest trial specifically focused on small abscesses (all < 5 cm diameter and about half ≤ 2 cm) in patients who had no signs of systemic infection. The RCTs included participants with skin abscesses anywhere on the body.

Eleven trials reported study setting, of which nine were conducted in emergency departments, one in outpatient dermatology clinics, and one in an Integrated Soft Tissue Infection Services (ISIS) clinic involving patients with high rates of comorbidity, such as infection with hepatitis C, hepatitis B, or HIV. The RCTs included children and adults. Almost all patients underwent incision and drainage for their skin abscess. The most common pathogen was MRSA (49–88%) followed by methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA, 9–18%).

### Pyogenic abscess of the liver… [^f5c4a1c3]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Abscess of the liver, of pyogenic origin, is associated with a high mortality rate. Multiple abscesses have been fatal, in most instances. With the advent of chemotherapeutic agents and antibiotic drugs, there has been improvement in the mortality rate. Reports of recovery in patients having multiple abscesses have appeared in recent years. Pyogenic abscess of the liver is the result of spread of septic thrombi or bacteria through the tributaries of the portal vein. Appendicitis, with thrombophlebitis of the ileocecal veins, has been considered a major source of liver abscess. 1–3 Pyogenic abscess of the liver may, however, follow trauma to the liver, cholangitis of the bile radicles, lymphatic spread from neighboring infections, and hematogenous spread from distant foci of infection, such as furuncles, osteomyelitis, and bronchiectasis.

### Initial presentations and final outcomes of primary pyogenic liver abscess: a cross-sectional study [^d77adaa4]. BMC Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

With the development of appropriate antimicrobial treatments and drainage methods for liver abscesses, PPLA survival rates have increased during this century. In our study population, the crude mortality rate was 4.5% (6/134). Overall, the crude PPLA mortality rate has varied in the recent decade, with the average value being around 5%. The mortality rates varied according to the differences in the geographic origins, study designs, study arms, and patient populations. A literature review indicated that malignancy on presentation is an important risk factor for PPLA mortality, similar to our results. In our study, the risk factors associated with PPLA mortality included gender, jaundice, rupture of liver abscess, and multiple organ failure. Some of these factors have been described previously, including jaundice, rupture of liver abscess, and endophthalmitis. Although the differences between genders could be related to testosterone levels, further experiments will be need to verify this. Multiple organ failure, initial low blood pressure, and initial respiratory distress are poor prognostic factors that result from higher disease severity, contributing to the higher mortality rates in the corresponding groups. In agreement with the results of Lin et al. our study revealed an association between the prolonged delay of effective antibiotics and aspiration/drainage therapies and the risk of mortality. Although in the present study the time intervals between the presentation and initiation of effective antibiotics therapy varied within a wide range because of the non-specific and highly variable nature of PPLA presentations, we strongly recommend that an early, empirical, short-course, broad-spectrum antibiotics therapy is considered when persistent fever or unstable hemodynamics occur during the initial stages of the empirical therapy. The Lin's report identified 6 independent risk factors predicting severe complications of K. pneumonia -related liver abscess: thrombocytopenia (< 100,000/mm3), alkaline phosphatase > 300 U/L, gas formation in the abscess, APACHE III score > 40, use of cefazolin (instead of extended-spectrum cephalosporin), and delayed drainage.

### Pyogenic liver abscess: uncommon presentation [^670ad639]. BMJ Case Reports (2016). Medium credibility.

Pyogenic liver abscess is a rare entity, but it is fatal when untreated. With a peak incidence in the fifth decade of life, its early recognition and intervention are key to successful treatment and better prognosis of patients. In recent years, its approach has been enhanced by the use of percutaneous drainage, improved imaging techniques and a better microbiological characterisation, allowing for a more appropriate use of antibiotics. Clinical manifestations are variable and depend on the size of the abscess, the condition of the patient, associated diseases and possible complications. Among the most common symptoms that stand out are the pain in the upper quadrants of the abdomen, high fever, nausea and vomiting. The authors present the case of a patient who developed an atrial flutter as the initial presentation of a hepatic abscess that imagiologically mimicked a hepatic tumour.

### Oral Campylobacter species involved in extraoral abscess: a report of three cases [^dbc0783a]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2005). Low credibility.

Oral Campylobacter species are rarely reported to cause extraoral infections. Here we present three cases of extraoral abscess caused by an oral Campylobacter sp. and a Streptococcus sp. The Campylobacter species were all isolated anaerobically and identified by sequencing analysis of the 16S rRNA gene. The cases included a breast abscess caused by Campylobacter rectus and a non-group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus in a patient with lymphoma, a liver abscess caused by Campylobacter curvus and an alpha-hemolytic streptococcus in a patient with complicated ovarian cancer, and a postobstructive bronchial abscess caused by C. curvus and group C beta-hemolytic Streptococcus constellatus in a patient with lung cancer. The abscesses were drained or resected, and the patients were treated with antibiotics with full resolution of the lesions. The C. curvus cases are likely the first reported infections by this organism, and the C. rectus case represents the second such reported extraoral infection.

### Cervical conization complicated by sepsis with lung and liver abscesses [^75819bfe]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Extrapelvic infections complicating cervical conization are exceedingly rare.

Case

Seven days after conization, a 44-year-old patient presented with fever and right upper quadrant pain. Pleural effusion and pulmonary and hepatic abscesses were detected. The pathology report of the conization showed microabscesses. Blood cultures grew Fusobacterium necrophorum. Intravenous antibiotics were administered. The pulmonary findings improved but did not completely resolve after drainage of pleural effusions. The patient refused further procedures and was discharged in good clinical condition and with oral antibiotics after 37 days.

Conclusions

Extrapelvic abscesses are rare complications of cervical conization. This is the first report in identifying F. necrophorum as a cause of this complication. Appropriate cultures, drainage of abscesses, and antibiotics are the mainstay of diagnosis and treatment.

Duration of therapy and oral step-down — guidance principles: Recommendations on durations of therapy are not provided, and durations may vary if initially inactive therapy was given; uncomplicated cystitis is typically mild and, if clinical improvement occurs despite empiric inactive therapy, it is generally not necessary to repeat urine culture, change the regimen, or extend the planned course, whereas for other infections if AST later indicates inactive empiric therapy, a change to an active regimen for a full treatment course (dated from the start of active therapy) is suggested; host factors and source control should inform duration decisions, and transitioning to oral therapy should be considered when susceptibility to an appropriate oral agent is demonstrated, the patient is hemodynamically stable, source control measures have occurred, and there are no concerns about insufficient intestinal absorption.

### Pyogenic liver abscesses in patients with malignant disease… [^5db903ee]. JAMA Network (1998). Excellent credibility.

Interventions Parenteral antibiotics, percutaneous drainage, surgical drainage, or hepatectomy, in combinations, were employed. Main Outcome Measures Patient characteristics, symptoms, laboratory data, abscess characteristics, microbiological study, management, and outcome of the 2 groups were analyzed. Results. Thirteen patients in group 1 and 16 patients in group 2 had undergone prior anticancer treatment. Jaundice was encountered more often in group 1 than in group 2, whereas nausea and vomiting were more frequently seen in group 2 than in group 1. By 1960, Sherman and Robbins2 had noted that biliary tract disease and malignant disease supplanted portal vein seeding as the most common mode of bacterial entry into the liver.

Thirteen of the 32 patients in group 1 and 16 of the 20 patients in group 2 had undergone anticancer treatment. Clinical manifestations of both groups are listed in Table 3. Group 1 had more cases of jaundice compared with group 2, while nausea and vomiting were more frequently seen in group 2 than in group

1. The pathogeneses of liver abscesses in group 1 patients were mainly malignant biliary obstruction and spontaneous or iatrogenic necrosis of primary hepatic neoplasms with superimposed bacterial infection. In contrast, the pathogeneses of the abscesses in group 2 patients included portal venous suppuration secondary to colorectal cancer, postgastrectomy for gastric cancer, and hepatic artery seeding with uncertain infectious nidi following systemic anticancer treatment.

In this series, the only 3 cases treated by hepatectomy had survived for only 3, 3, and 8 months after the operation. Our data indicated that hepatectomy was not justified in these cases and should not be encouraged in other such cases. The optimal management of concurrent liver abscess and cancer is to resolve life-threatening infection as simply as possible. Percutaneous drainage of the abscess, in addition to percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage if necessary, works well in most circumstances.

5 Treatment and Prognosis of RNOC

All patients received intravenous antibiotics for the initial episodes of RNOC, whenever possible after blood cultures. A beta‐lactamine was given in 20 (74%) patients (amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, piperacillin/tazobactam, or cefepim combined with metronidazole) for 7 (IQR: 5–8) days. For well‐tolerated episodes of RNOC, oral antibiotics were prescribed. Duration of antibiotics was reduced to 5 days and then 3 days after 2018 according to recent guidelines. In patients with more than 3 episodes, the most recent ones were treated by empirical oral antibiotics without new blood cultures. Antibiotics effectively treated the symptoms in all patients except 3 (11.1%), whose antibiotics were modified after several episodes due to germ resistance. No patients died from RNOC but 3 (11.1%) developed complications including hepatic abscesses in 3 and hemodynamic failure in one (3.7%). Overall, the most severe episode was graded 1, 2, and 3 in 17, 9, and one patients, respectively.

Sixteen patients received a prolonged treatment by ursodesoxycholic acid, but only 2 (13%) described a mild decrease in the frequency of cholangitis episodes. PPI discontinuation or anti‐inflammatory drugs were not tested. Four patients received periodic courses of antibiotics, resulting in a decreased frequency of episodes in 2 (50%). Jejunal loop dysfunction was suspected in 2 patients after assessment with CT, MRI, upper GI contrast (Figure 2), and HIDA scan, who were reoperated to build a specific 70 cm Roux‐en‐Y jejunal loop anastomosed to the CBD. No anomaly was noted intraoperatively and surgery failed with persisting RNOC in both patients. Finally, one improved with somatostatin analogs and the other one was diagnosed with liver hamartomatosis.
