## Question

Shotty mesenteric adenopathy

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about "shotty mesenteric adenopathy", including what it means, how to interpret it, and how to manage it. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the terminology and whether "shotty" is clinically meaningful or imprecise. Then, I should verify the normal size and distribution of mesenteric nodes on modern imaging. Next, I will categorize the differential diagnosis by etiology and highlight red flags. After that, I need to outline a practical diagnostic algorithm, including when to use PET/CT and when to biopsy. Finally, I will consider special populations and synthesize a concise, actionable conclusion with caveats and follow-up recommendations.

> Let me first confirm the terminology, because "shotty" is notoriously imprecise and can mislead management. Historically, "shotty" nodes are palpable, firm, and small like pellets, but the size range of shotgun pellets spans roughly 1.25 mm to over 9 mm, so a 1 cm node could still be called "shotty" yet be pathologic, which is why modern practice favors exact short-axis measurements and descriptors of consistency and mobility rather than "shotty" alone [^7ff25527].

> Wait, let me verify the baseline prevalence and size of mesenteric nodes on contemporary CT. Incidental mesenteric nodes are common on multidetector CT, and in otherwise healthy populations, nodes larger than 3 mm are seen in about 39% of patients, with most nodes measuring less than 5 mm and clustered near the mesenteric root; this supports the notion that nodes under about 5–6 mm are often within normal limits, though context matters [^7ff25527].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about any node under 10 mm being "benign". I should confirm disease-specific thresholds. In pediatric IBD, mesenteric nodes larger than 10 mm are considered abnormal and correlate with active Crohn's disease, whereas in adults, nodes under 10 mm are usually not concerning unless there are red flags; in sclerosing mesenteritis, nodes under 10 mm are expected, but nodes 10 mm or larger warrant closer scrutiny and possible PET/CT or biopsy if features are worrisome [^40195842] [^dd059719].

> I will now examine the etiologic categories, because the differential is broad and context-dependent. The main buckets are infectious, inflammatory/autoimmune, neoplastic, and idiopathic/reactive; within these, common culprits include viral or bacterial gastroenteritis, tuberculosis, Yersinia, HIV-associated lymphadenopathy, Crohn's disease, systemic lupus, lymphoma, and metastatic disease, with sclerosing mesenteritis/mesenteric panniculitis as a notable idiopathic entity that can mimic or accompany malignancy [^cf624677] [^d32fda5f] [^f3edd657] [^c44b865a] [^a050b108].

> Let me consider pediatric nuances carefully. In children, mesenteric adenitis is a frequent cause of right lower quadrant pain and is often self-limited, but I should double-check for mimics like appendicitis, intussusception, and, in the right epidemiologic context, tuberculosis. Point-of-care ultrasound can identify mesenteric nodes and guide disposition when surgical causes are excluded, though interobserver variability and limited data on size thresholds exist in pediatrics [^9990b233] [^67402c85] [^40195842].

> Next, I should review red flags that push me toward malignancy or biopsy. Nodes 10 mm or larger, progressive enlargement, necrosis or calcification outside granulomatous disease, necrotic or ring-enhancing patterns, FDG avidity with SUVmax 3.0 or higher, extramesenteric disease, B symptoms, or a history of malignancy should prompt PET/CT and tissue diagnosis rather than observation; conversely, small, stable, non-FDG-avid nodes in a young patient with a viral illness are typically reactive and safe to follow [^55e3d491] [^cb49380a] [^74fc6223].

> I need to ensure the diagnostic algorithm is practical. Start with clinical context and labs, then choose modality based on age and suspicion: ultrasound for children and young adults to avoid radiation, contrast-enhanced CT for acute pain or suspected obstruction, and MR enterography for IBD mapping. If nodes are 10 mm or larger or features are concerning, obtain FDG-PET/CT to assess metabolic activity and guide biopsy to the most accessible, highest-yield site, ideally with core needle tissue for lymphoma subtyping or granulomatous disease workup [^db220f0d] [^55e3d491] [^74fc6223].

> But wait, what if the imaging shows sclerosing mesenteritis rather than isolated nodes. I should confirm the CT criteria: a hazy mesenteric fat mass, hyperattenuating fat, soft-tissue nodules, a fat halo sign, and a pseudocapsule; if three or more are present and there are no alarm features, a presumptive diagnosis without biopsy is reasonable, but nodes 10 mm or larger or atypical features should trigger PET/CT and consideration of biopsy to exclude lymphoma or IgG4-related disease [^877f9f48] [^dd059719].

> Let me reconsider the role of PET/CT, because false positives occur. In lymphoma, interim and end-of-treatment PET/CT is standard, but positive findings should be interpreted cautiously and, when results would change management, rebiopsy is recommended to confirm residual disease versus transformation; similarly, in misty mesentery or unexplained mesenteric nodes, combining size greater than 10 mm with SUVmax 3.0 or higher yields high specificity for viable malignancy, though clinical correlation remains essential [^74fc6223] [^cb49380a].

> I should double-check special scenarios. In Crohn's disease, mesenteric nodes can be the only clue to proximal small bowel disease when bowel wall looks normal on MRE, so their presence can justify capsule endoscopy or deeper evaluation. In colorectal cancer, paradoxically, benign mesenteric node enlargement has been associated with better recurrence-free and overall survival, so I must avoid overcalling these as metastatic without histology. And in refractory celiac disease, mesenteric nodes raise concern for enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma and warrant dedicated small bowel imaging and close follow-up [^4041ddc1] [^f1f1b09b] [^908598bd].

> Next, I should review follow-up for truly low-risk incidental nodes. If nodes are under 10 mm, stable, non-FDG-avid, and the patient is asymptomatic, observation with clinical correlation is appropriate; in sclerosing mesenteritis without concerning features, some experts recommend annual CT for 2 years to ensure stability, though evidence is limited and individualized decisions are reasonable [^0c5674f8].

> In summary, I need to ensure my documentation replaces "shotty" with precise short-axis measurements and descriptors. Nodes under about 5–6 mm are often normal, 6–10 mm may be reactive depending on context, and 10 mm or larger, especially with concerning features or systemic symptoms, should prompt PET/CT and tissue diagnosis. Anchoring the workup to clinical context, using modality-appropriate imaging, and applying red flags avoids both overdiagnosis and missed malignancy or infection [^7ff25527] [^575539b7] [^55e3d491].

---

Shotty mesenteric adenopathy refers to **multiple small, non-tender mesenteric lymph nodes** (typically 3–5 mm) that are round and firm like pellets, often found incidentally on imaging [^575539b7]. It is usually a **benign, reactive response** to minor infections or inflammation, especially in children and young adults, and rarely indicates serious disease [^9990b233]. Management is **observation and reassurance** unless there are red flags (nodes > 10 mm, systemic symptoms, or known malignancy), in which case further workup is warranted [^dd059719].

---

## Clinical significance

Shotty mesenteric adenopathy is **typically benign and self-limited**, reflecting a reactive response to minor infections or inflammation. It is especially common in children and young adults, often following viral or bacterial gastroenteritis [^07e5f631]. In most cases, the nodes resolve spontaneously without intervention [^cb37cfa7].

---

## Common causes

| **Category** | **Examples** |
|-|-|
| Infectious | - Viral gastroenteritis <br/> - Bacterial enteritis (e.g. Yersinia) <br/> - Tuberculosis <br/> - HIV [^f3edd657] |
| Inflammatory | - Crohn's disease <br/> - Systemic lupus erythematosus <br/> - Sarcoidosis [^4dc130b2] [^5a30b9f2] |
| Idiopathic | - Reactive lymphadenopathy <br/> - Mesenteric adenitis [^07e5f631] |

---

## Imaging characteristics

On CT or MRI, shotty mesenteric nodes are **small (3–5 mm), round, and well-circumscribed**, with homogeneous enhancement and no necrosis or calcification. They are typically distributed along the mesenteric vessels and may cluster in the right lower quadrant [^575539b7].

---

## Clinical evaluation

When evaluating shotty mesenteric adenopathy, consider:

- **Size**: Nodes < 10 mm are usually benign; > 10 mm warrant further evaluation [^dd059719].
- **Symptoms**: Fever, weight loss, night sweats, or persistent pain raise concern.
- **History**: Recent infections, travel, or immunocompromise guide the differential [^d32fda5f].
- **Laboratory tests**: CBC, ESR, CRP, and targeted serologies (e.g. HIV, TB) as indicated [^notfound].

---

## Indications for further investigation

Further workup is indicated when any of the following are present:

- Nodes ≥ 10 mm or rapidly enlarging [^dd059719].
- Systemic symptoms (fever, weight loss, night sweats).
- Known malignancy or immunocompromise.
- Persistent or unexplained symptoms.

---

## Diagnostic approach

If red flags are present, use **contrast-enhanced CT or MRI** to characterize nodes and assess for complications [^d0daa093]. PET/CT helps distinguish benign from malignant disease when lymphoma or metastasis is suspected [^cb49380a]. Image-guided biopsy is reserved for nodes > 10 mm with concerning features or when malignancy is suspected [^55e3d491].

---

## Management strategies

- **Observation**: For asymptomatic patients with nodes < 10 mm and no red flags, reassure and follow clinically [^dd059719].
- **Treat underlying cause**: Manage identified infections or inflammatory conditions.
- **Biopsy**: For nodes ≥ 10 mm or with concerning features, obtain tissue diagnosis [^55e3d491].
- **Follow-up imaging**: Consider repeat imaging if symptoms persist or nodes enlarge.

---

## Prognosis

The prognosis is **excellent**; most cases resolve spontaneously. Persistent nodes may reflect chronic inflammation but rarely indicate malignancy if < 10 mm and stable [^575539b7].

---

Shotty mesenteric adenopathy is a **benign, reactive nodal pattern** that typically requires no treatment beyond observation and reassurance. Reserve further workup for nodes ≥ 10 mm, systemic symptoms, or known malignancy.

### Mesenteric lymph nodes seen at imaging: causes and significance [^cf624677]. Radiographics (2005). Low credibility.

With the advent of multidetector computed tomography, routine evaluation of mesenteric lymph nodes is now possible. For the first time, normal mesenteric nodes may be reliably identified noninvasively. Because of the increasing volume of cross-sectional imaging examinations being performed, lymph nodes in the mesentery are being detected with increasing frequency. This is often an unsuspected finding. Although the detected lymph nodes may be normal, there is a large number of disease processes that may lead to mesenteric lymphadenopathy. The most common causes of mesenteric lymphadenopathy are neoplastic, inflammatory, and infectious processes. Many of these causes may also result in lymphadenopathy elsewhere in the body. It is important to recognize mesenteric lymphadenopathy in patients with a history of a primary carcinoma because the lymphadenopathy affects the staging of the disease, which in turn will affect further management. In addition, mesenteric lymphadenopathy may be the only indicator of an underlying inflammatory or infectious process causing abdominal pain. The distribution of the lymph nodes may indicate the exact nature of the underlying disease process, and the correct treatment may then be instituted. Besides neoplastic, inflammatory, and infectious processes, many other disease processes may occasionally result in mesenteric lymphadenopathy.

### Mesenteric adenopathy in patients with prostate cancer: frequency and etiology [^da57c656]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

This study was undertaken to determine the frequency and etiology of mesenteric adenopathy revealed at initial-staging CT in patients with prostate cancer.

Conclusion

Mesenteric adenopathy is a rare finding at initial-staging CT in patients with prostate cancer and is more often due to coexistent lymphoma than to metastatic disease, particularly in the absence of associated pelvic adenopathy and a markedly elevated serum prostate-specific antigen level. Appropriate radiologic interpretation of the finding prevents overstaging of prostate cancer.

### Mesenteric adenitis: CT diagnosis of primary versus secondary causes, incidence, and clinical significance in pediatric and adult patients [^07e5f631]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

Our objective was to determine the clinical significance of mesenteric adentitis when detected on CT.

Materials and Methods

Mesenteric adenitis was considered present if a cluster of three or more lymph nodes measuring 5 mm or greater each was present in the right lower quadrant mesentery. If no other abnormality was detected on CT, then mesenteric adenitis was considered primary. If a specific inflammatory process was detected in addition to the lymphadenopathy, then mesenteric adenitis was considered secondary. Patients with a known neoplasm or HIV infection were excluded. Three separate groups of patients were examined for the presence and cause of mesenteric adenitis. Group 1 consisted of 60 consecutive patients prospectively identified with mesenteric adenitis on CT examinations. Group 2 consisted of 60 consecutive patients undergoing abdominal and pelvic CT for evaluation of blunt or penetrating abdominal trauma. Group 3 consisted of 60 consecutive patients undergoing abdominal and pelvic CT with acute abdominal symptoms. In all patients, the indication for imaging was documented, and the size of the largest lymph node, when present, was measured. In patients with mesenteric adenitis, the CT findings, clinical history, and clinical or surgical follow-up were subsequently evaluated to determine the cause of mesenteric adenitis.

Results

In the 60 patients prospectively identified with CT findings of mesenteric adenitis (group 1), 18 (30%) of 60 had primary mesenteric adenitis. The remaining 42 patients (70%) had an associated inflammatory condition that was established on CT as the likely cause of mesenteric adenitis. Mesenteric adenitis was present in none (0%) of the 60 patients in group 2 and in five (8.3%) of 60 patients in group 3.

Conclusion

The incidence of mesenteric adenitis in patients with and those without abdominal pain is low. When evidence of mesenteric adenitis is present on CT examinations, usually a specific diagnosis can be established as its cause.

### Severe COVID-19 initially presenting as mesenteric adenopathy [^7ece6218]. Pediatric Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) can present with abdominal pain in children and adults. Most imaging findings have been limited to characteristic lung findings, as well as one report of bowel-ischemia-related findings in adults. We report a case of COVID-19 in a healthy teenager who initially presented with isolated mesenteric adenopathy, typically a self-limited illness, which progressed to severe illness requiring intensive care before complete recovery. The boy tested negative for COVID-19 twice by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from upper respiratory swabs before sputum PCR resulted positive. A high index of suspicion should be maintained for COVID-19 given the continued emergence of new manifestations of the disease.

### Mesenteric lymph nodes: detection and significance on MDCT [^575539b7]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

Unsuspected mesenteric lymph nodes are frequently found on abdominal CT scans in everyday clinical practice. What to do with these findings has not been well established. The purpose of this study is to document the incidence of mesenteric lymph nodes in a previously healthy population and to provide guidelines for further management.

Materials and Methods

We examined the CT scans of 132 consecutive patients (84 men and 36 women; age range, 12–90 years; mean age, 43 years) who presented to the emergency department after experiencing blunt abdominal trauma. Twelve patients were excluded because they had disease processes known to be associated with lymphadenopathy. All imaging was performed using 3.2-mm collimation on MDCT scanners with IV contrast material. Two radiologists evaluated the images by consensus and recorded the presence of mesenteric lymph nodes greater than 3 mm in the short axis. Lymph node size, number, and location (central, peripheral, or right lower quadrant) were documented. All studies were reviewed on a PACS workstation.

Results

Of the 120 patients with otherwise normal CT scans, 47 had mesenteric lymph nodes greater than 3 mm. Of these 47 patients, 22 (47%) had five or more lymph nodes detected. Twenty-five (53%) of the 47 patients had four or fewer nodes. The mean size of the largest nodes was 4.8 mm (range, 3–9 mm), and the mean size of the nodes found per patient was 3.6 mm (range, 3–6 mm). These nodes were identified only at the mesenteric root in 32 patients (68%), only in the mesenteric periphery in eight patients (17%), and only in the right lower quadrant in five patients (11%). Nodes were identified in more than one location in two patients (4%).

Conclusion

Incidental finding of mesenteric lymph nodes is common, reflecting more widespread use of thin-collimation MDCT and PACS workstations. In general, these nodes are small, measuring less than 5 mm. Such nodes when found in an otherwise healthy population are clinically insignificant and require no further imaging.

### Update on the mesentery: structure, function, and role in disease [^12f8cde4]. The Lancet: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2022). High credibility.

Over the past 5 years, systematic investigation of the mesenteric organ has expanded and shown that the mesentery is the organ in and on which all abdominal digestive organs develop and remain connected to. In turn, this observation has clarified the anatomical foundation of the abdomen and the fundamental order at that level. Findings related to the shape and development of the mesentery have illuminated its function, advancing our understanding of the pathobiology, diagnosis, and treatment of several abdominal and systemic diseases. Inclusion of the mesentery in surgical resections alters the course of benign and malignant diseases. Mesenteric-based scoring systems can enhance the radiological interpretation of abdominal disease. Emerging findings reconcile observations across scientific and clinical fields and have been assimilated into reference curricula and practice guidelines. This Review summarises the developmental, anatomical, and clinical advances made since the mesentery was redesignated as an organ in 2016.

### Diagnostic significance of mesenteric lymph node involvement in proximal small bowel Crohn's disease [^6890823e]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

To conclude, regional mesenteric lymph node assessment at MRE can be valuable to suggest the possibility of proximal bowel disease in patients with CD, even when the proximal bowel looks normal at imaging. Thus, the presence of inflamed-appearing proximal mesenteric lymph nodes at MRE in patients with CD possibly warrants further investigation of the proximal small bowel by endoscopic measures.

A 5-year-old male with Gaucher's disease type 3 developed progressive mesenteric and mediastinal lymphadenopathy over 12 months, despite enzyme replacement therapy, contributing to the development of a protein-losing enteropathy. These complications are unique, indicating poorly accessible, differentially responsive compartments in patients with Gaucher's disease who are receiving enzyme therapy.

Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2023). Medium credibility.

MESENTERIC FEATURES

Mesenteric features of importance in pediatric IBD assessment include hyperemia (as assessed with color Doppler blood flow to the bowel wall), lymphadenopathy, and inflammatory fat.

Mesenteric Inflammatory Fat

Mesenteric inflammatory fat, or "creeping" fat is a well-recognized feature of inflammation associated with CD. Increased inflammatory fat can be visualized as hyperechoic areas extending from the serosa into the mesentery, essentially wrapping the outer bowel wall (Fig. 3 B). Significant thickening of the mesenteric fat can have a mass-effect, displacing adjacent bowel loops. There is no standardized measure to quantify mesenteric inflammatory fat visualized on ultrasound and thus, many sonographers will comment on the presence or absence of inflammatory fat.

Lymphadenopathy

Lymphadenopathy, and more specifically, enlargement of mesenteric lymph nodes > 10 mm in short axis, has been associated with active CD inflammation, although are nonspecific. The interpretation of enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes is challenging in the pediatric population as children commonly have mesenteric adenitis related to intercurrent infection or other etiologies. There is limited data on interpretation and reporting lymphadenopathy in children and more research is needed before standardized reporting can be recommended.

### Mesenteric panniculitis: systematic review of cross-sectional imaging findings and risk of subsequent malignancy [^b1f0363c]. European Radiology (2016). Low credibility.

A research study to answer this question should recruit consecutive, unselected patients prospectively, to reduce inclusion bias. Patients should be representative of those undergoing abdominopelvic CT for all indications since CT is the modality usually precipitating the problem. Observers should be radiologists familiar with and able to diagnose MP, and precise CT definitions for the diagnosis should be stipulated (which was largely lacking from the papers we identified). Patients would need to be characterised in detail, to identify and exclude those with existing or undiagnosed malignancy at the time of imaging, and to clarify symptoms and their natural history. Follow-up should be sufficient to establish clinical outcome with precision, and should extend several years to determine any link with subsequent malignancy, likely via cancer registries so as to maximize data capture and to allow comparison with age- and sex-matched controls. A multicentre setting would be necessary both to achieve sufficient power and to enhance generalisability of results. Imaging findings should be correlated with clinical outcome. For example, we attempted to extract eight individual CT features of MP but could not do this completely for any individual article. Indeed, several studies failed to report the imaging features of MP or characterise lymphadenopathy. Description of the CT features of MP is therefore generally poor, which hinders any critical discussion of the precise imaging features necessary for diagnosis.

In summary, we performed a systematic review to determine any association between imaging findings of idiopathic MP and development of subsequent malignancy. Overall, studies were heterogeneous and used varying methodologies to identify patients, resulting in biased accrual. Frequently, patients and their clinical follow-up were characterised insufficiently to answer our research question. We could not perform meta-analysis. Any association between imaging features of idiopathic MP and development of subsequent malignancy remains unknown presently. The available literature currently lacks studies that are methodologically sound enough to answer this important question with precision.

### AGA clinical practice update on sclerosing mesenteritis: commentary [^dd059719]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2025). High credibility.

Sclerosing mesenteritis evaluation — CT scan with "misty mesentery" is followed by "Review CT with radiologist and history with patient", then branching to "Evidence of secondary cause" versus "No evidence of secondary cause". With secondary causes, management is "Further work-up or treatment guided by suspected etiology", including "Consider PET-CT" and "Biopsy any suspicious lesions". Without a secondary cause, diagnosis requires "Meets at least 3 of 5 criteria" (mesenteric mass encasing or displacing adjacent structures but not infiltrating; hyper‑attenuating fat; soft‑tissue nodules [lymph nodes]; "Fat halo" sign; pseudocapsule); if it "Does not meet criteria", then "Asymptomatic: observe" or "Symptomatic: consider other diagnoses". After confirmation, node size guides next steps: "Lymph node(s) < 10 mm" leads to "Asymptomatic (or mild symptoms): Observation" and "Consider CT/MRI yearly x 2 years", whereas "Lymph node(s) ≥ 10 mm" leads to "Symptomatic: Treatment".

### Diagnostic significance of mesenteric lymph node involvement in proximal small bowel Crohn's disease [^b0a435d6]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Radmard et al. were the first to suggest that lymph node features at MRE can be predictive of disease activity. In their study, however, only five patients had jejunal disease. One possible reason to explain the association between regional lymph nodes and CD is the paradigm that the primary pathology in CD involves altered intestinal permeability, bacterial translocation, and inflammation in draining lymph nodes. The impaired regulation of the lymphatic system on inflammation and the immune response contribute to the pathogenesis of CD. – It is therefore possible that regional lymph node imaging features could be more sensitive for disease detection, although less specific, compared to bowel imaging features.

The lack of a significant association between regional lymph nodes at MRE and CD activity according to VCE scores concurs with previous results obtained when using intestinal US. Cohort studies and prospective longitudinal studies have shown that the presence of mesenteric regional lymph nodes does not correlate with clinical and biochemical disease activity in CD. Lymph nodes may persist in CD patients who went into clinical remission after therapy, even after the normalization or improvement of bowel wall thickening. The presence of regional lymph nodes may therefore be more of an indicator for disease than a reliable parameter of its activity. This feature could be useful to hint on disease localization. It is important to note that mesenteric lymph nodes are non-specific for CD. Other common inflammatory and infectious diseases, such as celiac disease and bacterial enteritides may have enlarged mesenteric regional lymph nodes. On the other hand, MRE in those cases can be the first modality to suggest proximal small bowel disease and justify further investigation of the proximal small bowel by endoscopic measures. Furthermore, it may be valuable to suggest proximal involvement in cases resistant to medical treatment, for follow-up on the evolution of disease in this location, and although non-specific, to suggest the possibility of new IBD diagnosis.

This study has several limitations. First, it is based on a retrospective analysis and results should be interpreted accordingly. Second, we did not evaluate distal bowel disease or compared between proximal and distal disease MRE parameters, as this was not the focus of the current study. Third, difference between imaging techniques and devices exists between the two institutions as described. There were also differences in medical therapies between the institutions as detailed. Fourth, an interval of up to 12 months between the MRE and VCE studies was allowed. Finally, we defined Lewis scores at VCE as our standard reference for presence of disease as well as disease activity. Although considered to have high sensitivity and specificity, proximal disease can be missed or misdiagnosed by VCE.

### The role of EUS for evaluation of mediastinal adenopathy [^2b9b8ada]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2003). Low credibility.

This is one of a series of statements discussing the utilization of GI endoscopy in common clinical situations. The Standards of Practice Committee of the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy prepared this text. In preparing this guideline, a MEDLINE literature search was performed, and additional references were obtained from the bibliographies of the identified articles and from recommendations of expert consultants. When little or no data exist from well-designed prospective trials, emphasis is given to results from large series and reports from recognized experts. Guidelines for appropriate utilization of endoscopy are based on a critical review of the available data and expert consensus. Further controlled clinical studies are needed to clarify aspects of this statement, and revision may be necessary as new data appear. Clinical consideration may justify a course of action at variance to these recommendations.

### Mesenteric panniculitis: systematic review of cross-sectional imaging findings and risk of subsequent malignancy [^11fad64d]. European Radiology (2016). Low credibility.

Severe manifestations of MP do appear to exist, but the overall proportion of patients with proven histology was very small, suggesting the large majority do not come to surgery for MP alone. Stipulating histological proof of MP would create substantial spectrum bias towards severe disease, unrepresentative of most patients with MP. While, strictly speaking, the true prevalence of idiopathic MP can only be ascertained by examining asymptomatic patients as well, the clinical problem turns on imaged patients who then present a clinical dilemma. Accordingly, the majority of studies used CT scanning as the reference standard for diagnosis. Although this suggests incorporation bias, we do not believe this is a major issue because the clinical issue revolves around these very same patients. CT scans on which MP is diagnosed are usually performed to investigate abdominopelvic symptoms, so we would expect symptom prevalence to appear high: Overall, 79% had symptoms. However, it is unclear what proportion of idiopathic MP is symptomatic. For example, many patients had underlying malignancy and/or symptoms that may be unrelated to MP. Our anecdotal experience in patients without malignancy suggests that symptoms precipitating the initial scan often subside but features of MP persist across subsequent imaging. Unfortunately, individual studies reported insufficient detail for us to resolve these issues. Ultimately, we concluded that the incidence of idiopathic MP is unknown with precision currently.

Our primary research question asked what proportion of patients with idiopathic MP then develop subsequent malignancy? However, many studies did not report a follow-up period, or this was relatively short. Unfortunately, we concluded that just four studies allowed the reader to determine the proportion of an unselected consecutive group of MP patients who developed malignancy subsequently. Ultimately, because three of these were potentially subject to accrual bias and the fourth had excluded patients with lymphadenopathy in excess of 1 cm, we concluded that no study in the existing literature could answer our research question using sound methodology. Our intention to perform meta-analysis was frustrated. Furthermore, we found no prior systematic reviews. Ultimately, we do not know whether patients with apparently idiopathic MP are at greater risk of subsequent malignancy than the age- and sex-matched general population, a conclusion also reached by a recent commentary.

### Mesenteric panniculitis: systematic review of cross-sectional imaging findings and risk of subsequent malignancy [^c1870547]. European Radiology (2016). Low credibility.

Data extraction

The following data were extracted from full articles meeting inclusion criteria by the two radiologists performing the search (working independently), into a database (Excel for Mac 2011, Microsoft, Redmond WA): We noted sample size, gender and age distribution of participants, whether the study was single or multicentre, and whether accrual was prospective or retrospective. We noted the proportion of patients with malignancy and/or a history of abdominopelvic surgery at accrual, the proportion who were symptomatic, the length of follow-up and the proportion developing new malignancy during follow-up, and its nature. We assessed whether patient selection was subject to spectrum bias (e.g. by using a retrospective keyword search) and whether the study design allowed estimation of the proportion of patients without malignancy who then developed malignancy subsequent to their diagnosis of MP. We noted the imaging test used for diagnosis of MP and whether an independent reference test was adopted.

Regarding CT features of MP, we noted the following eight features: Proportion of patients exhibiting increased mesenteric density; whether a mesenteric 'mass' was present; linear dimensions of any mass; whether a 'capsule' was present; the proportion of patients with lymphadenopathy; the largest nodal diameter; diameter range; proportion of patients with a nodal 'halo'.

Analysis

Tabulated data were described by median and range (or mean where this was presented in the primary article). We wished to perform a meta-analysis to obtain a point-estimate describing the proportion of patients with MP who developed subsequent malignancy. Ultimately, meta-analysis was prevented by the small number of studies retrieved that presented adequate data, combined with excessive methodological heterogeneity, meaning that any point estimate would lack precision. We wrote our report noting PRISMA guidelines for transparent reporting of systematic reviews.

### Diagnostic significance of mesenteric lymph node involvement in proximal small bowel Crohn's disease [^31e88415]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Results

A total of 64 patients (53 from one institution, and 11 from the other) were included in the final analysis. Mean age was 33.9 years [standard deviation (SD): 13.5, range: 13–75, median: 31.0]. There were 35 (54.7%) male patients and 29 female patients (45.3%). Mean disease duration was 5.16 years (SD: 5.10, range: 0–23, median: 4.0). Patient demographic and clinical characteristics are detailed in Table 1. The different medical therapies in the two institutions are detailed in.

Table 1.
Demographic characteristics of patients.

According to the VCE results, 24/64 (37.5%) of patients had jejunal disease, with a mean regional Lewis score of 691.5 (SD: 935.2, range: 135–3756, median: 450.0). When evaluating the bowel at MRE, proximal bowel disease was detected in only one patient, while distal bowel disease was detected in 42 patients. Mesenteric lymph nodes in LUQ were present in 20/64 (31.2%) patients. Their mean SAD was 0.80 cm ± 0.23, and the mean number of lymph nodes in LUQ was 1.47 ± 2.84. In contrast, mesenteric lymph nodes were present in the right lower quadrant in 41 patients, mean SAD 0.77 cm ± 0.27, and mean number of lymph nodes 2.98 ± 3.63.

### Intestinal lymphangiectasia mimicking primary peritoneal carcinoma [^2e51815d]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2010). Low credibility.

Intestinal lymphangiectasia is an obstruction of the lymphatic system. We report on a patient with mesenteric adenopathy and an elevated CA125 level, which were suspicious for peritoneal carcinoma. Further evaluation and bowel resection identified intestinal lymphangiectasia. This disease should be considered in patients with mesenteric adenopathy and a small bowel mass.

### Mesenteric panniculitis: systematic review of cross-sectional imaging findings and risk of subsequent malignancy [^bc8e230b]. European Radiology (2016). Low credibility.

Discussion

Mesenteric panniculitis presents a clinical problem when discovered incidentally in patients not known to have an underlying cause, in which case it can be termed 'idiopathic'. Because an association with subsequent malignancy has been described, patients are frequently referred for follow-up imaging on multiple occasions over a prolonged period. The precise extent to which this happens is unknown currently, but anecdotal evidence suggests it is substantial, not least because features of MP often persist. We were prompted to perform our systematic review because this set of circumstances had arisen on multiple occasions during our hospital multidisciplinary meetings. In particular, we were interested in assessing primary research evidence linking apparently idiopathic MP with subsequent malignancy.

We found that 38% of reported patients had known underlying malignancy at the time MP was diagnosed. In such cases MP assumes a minor role, since attention will focus on known malignancy. Studies that include patients with known malignancy will confound any attempt to determine the clinical course of patients with incidental MP. The true incidence of MP is difficult to determine since this requires assessment of a consecutive, unselected group of patients by radiologists aware of and able to diagnose the condition. Most studies applied a search term to a radiology information system retrospectively, potentially missing patients whose report did not contain the term. One study used a retrospective cohort design to interrogate consecutive scans, which eliminates inclusion bias, but then excluded patients with lymphadenopathy, which will likely eliminate some patients with idiopathic MP. A minority did report consecutive, prospective cases but were often personal series hampered by small size and single-centre accrual. We found the prevalence of MP was just 0.2% for studies using a retrospective keyword search versus 1.7% for studies interpreting a consecutive series. These data suggest that keyword searches miss most patents with MP.

### Clinical characteristics, outcomes, and interobserver agreement of point-of-care ultrasound detected mesenteric adenitis in nonsurgical pediatric abdominal pain: a retrospective cohort study [^9990b233]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2024). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

In the absence of readily available imaging data, mesenteric adenitis was customarily taught as a diagnosis of exclusion. With the growing availability of POCUS and the ability to visualize the presence or absence of mesenteric adenitis and integrate the location of abdominal pain while evaluating for surgical diagnoses, it is now feasible to make the diagnosis of mesenteric adenitis with surgical diagnoses excluded in the ED. Little information is available regarding the clinical characteristics of pediatric ED patients with nonsurgical abdominal pain from mesenteric adenitis visualized on POCUS; however, it must be stressed that surgical causes of abdominal pain must be excluded before the diagnosis of mesenteric adenitis can be considered. – Furthermore, research by Gross et alsuggests that lymph node size does not appear to differentiate mesenteric adenitis associated with appendicitis compared with mesenteric adenitis from nonsurgical causes. In our limited retrospective series, we demonstrate that POCUS diagnosis of mesenteric adenitis can be made without any significant missed surgical diagnoses.

Our ED catchment area includes recent arrivals of children or adolescents from high-prevalence areas for tuberculosis, for which 2 patients in our retrospective cohort were diagnosed with tuberculous mesenteric adenitis, which has important implications from a global health perspective. A POCUS protocol for detecting extrapulmonary tuberculosis designed for high-prevalence areas with HIV and tuberculosis, named FASH (focused assessment for HIV-associated tuberculosis) examination, includes detecting pericardial effusion, pleural effusion, retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymphadenopathy, splenic microabscesses, and ascites. Mesenteric adenitis is a key and only finding in the FASH examination in our 2 patients who were both HIV negative; a 21-year-old male patient with multiple lower abdominal mesenteric lymph nodes and bowel wall thickening and positive interferon gamma release assay who subsequently developed bowel obstruction and a 10-year-old with a mass of right-lower-quadrant mesenteric lymph nodes that was biopsied to rule out malignancy that showed necrotizing granulomas consistent with tuberculous mesenteric adenitis. Mesenteric adenitis from tuberculosis in children identified by POCUS has been sporadically reported in the medical literature.

### Diagnostic significance of mesenteric lymph node involvement in proximal small bowel Crohn's disease [^c5bf4cf3]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Crohn's disease (CD) is an inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) that may affect any segment of the gastrointestinal tract. The involvement of the proximal bowel is less common, accounting for up to 30% of cases. Proximal bowel disease, however, has a generally less favourable outcome compared with other locations. In particular, it is associated with higher risk for strictures and penetrating complications, surgery, and postoperative recurrence.

According to the European Crohn's and Colitis Organisation and the European Society of Gastrointestinal and Abdominal Radiology guidelines, diagnostic assessment methods for proximal bowel involvement may include video capsule endoscopy (VCE), double balloon enteroscopy, magnetic resonance enterography (MRE), and intestinal ultrasound (US). Endoscopic methods are used more frequently compared to MRE and US for diagnosis. That is because endoscopic techniques are more sensitive for lesion detection in the proximal small bowel (20–40% higher sensitivity compared to imaging), MRE and US, although less sensitive for proximal lesions detection, have other advantages. These imaging modalities can detect trans-mural involvement as well as disease complications (e.g. strictures, fistulas, and abscesses).

The inflammatory process in CD is usually associated with peri-intestinal inflammatory reactions. It has been suggested that the presence and features of mesenteric lymph nodes may correlate with early disease onset and disease activity. Thus, it is likely that proximal bowel disease detectable at VCE may be associated with regional mesenteric lymph node involvement, potentially detectable with imaging methods.

The significance of proximal mesenteric lymph nodes at imaging and association with disease activity has not been adequately investigated so far. We therefore aim to assess whether inflamed-appearing mesenteric lymph nodes adjacent to the jejunum at MRE are associated with proximal small bowel disease as detected by VCE.

### Mesenteric panniculitis: systematic review of cross-sectional imaging findings and risk of subsequent malignancy [^78ad03e8]. European Radiology (2016). Low credibility.

Imaging features of mesenteric panniculitis

We investigated eight CT features of MP but we were unable to extract all of these from any individual article, indicating that description of CT features was generally poor. Of the nine studies that described whether patients had increased mesenteric density on CT scanning, 556 (90%) of 617 patients displayed this feature. Indeed, eight studies stipulated this feature as an inclusion criterion. A discrete 'mass' was described in 473 (93%) of the 509 patients in whom this was evaluated. Again, several studies stipulated this feature as an inclusion criterion. Only four (27%) studies documented the dimension of any mass, reporting means of 40 mm (range 20–74), 50 mm (27–108 mm), 95 mm (range 71–152 mm) and 95 mm (standard deviation 19 mm), respectively. Six studies stated whether a hyperattenuating rim appeared to encapsulate the region of mesenteric panniculitis, this feature being present in 239 (57%) of the 417 patients evaluated. The individual proportion ranged between 35% and 59%.

Given that lymph nodes are a prominent feature of mesenteric panniculitis, the description of nodal imaging characteristics was surprisingly sparse overall. Some studies described 'bulky lymphadenopathy' but did not define the nodal diameter or other characteristics necessary to satisfy this definition. Others defined lymphadenopathy as a diameter greater than 1 cm and noted the proportion of patients exceeding this threshold, but gave no other details; for example the mean diameter and range of nodal size for these patients or for patients overall. Conversely, one study excluded patients with nodes measuring 1 cm or greater, believing this to exclude the diagnosis of mesenteric panniculitis. The largest nodal diameter could be determined in only four (27%) studies, being 13 mm, 19 mm, 35 mm and 41 mm, respectively. Ultimately, only two studies described mean nodal diameter and the range across all patients, this being 6.4 mm (range 3.1–13 mm) and 8.7 mm (range 3–35 mm), respectively. Seven studies stated whether lymph nodes were surrounded by a hypoattenuating 'halo' within the region of mesenteric panniculitis, a feature present in 284 (64%) of the 446 patients in whom this was assessed. The individual proportion ranged widely between 7% and 94%.

### Significance of mesenteric lymphadenopathy after pancreaticoduodenectomy for periampullary carcinomas: evaluation with serial MDCT studies [^cae1c3c7]. European Journal of Radiology (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the significance of mesenteric lymphadenopathy arising after pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) for periampullary carcinomas.

Materials and Methods

Serial multidetector CT (MDCT) studies in 44 patients after PD for periampullary carcinomas (Group A) were retrospectively reviewed, the incidence and interval changes of mesenteric lymphadenopathy were evaluated, and comparisons were made with 21 patients who underwent PD for benign diseases (Group B).

Results

In Group A, mesenteric lymphadenopathy was seen in 31 of 44 (70.5%) patients. The short axis diameter of the largest lymph node ranged from 6.2 to 11.5mm (mean ± S.D.: 8.6 ± 1.4mm), and the short-axis-to-long-axis (S/L) ratio ranged from 0.46 to 0.99 (mean ± S.D.: 0.69 ± 0.12). Six of the 31 (19.4%) mesenteric lymphadenopathy cases showed interval increases in size on follow-up studies, and three cases showed new development of mesenteric lymphadenopathy: all of these nine cases had concurrent recurrence in the mesenteric root. In Group B, 11 (52.4%) had mesenteric lymphadenopathy. The short axis diameter of the largest lymph node ranged from 5.6 to 10.9mm (mean ± S.D.: 8.0 ± 1.9mm) and the S/L ratio ranged from 0.48 to 0.93 (mean ± S.D.: 0.67 ± 0.12). Differences in the incidence, short axis diameter and S/L ratio were not significant between Groups A and B (p = 0.154, 0.271 and 0.654, respectively).

Conclusion

Mesenetric lymphadenopathy after PD less likely reflects recurrence. Lymph node metastasis may be suggested only when coexisting recurrent mass is found in the proximal mesenteric root.

### Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children: a systematic review [^761825e6]. EClinicalMedicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Another population that requires further investigation are children who are overweight or obese. In this review, children who were overweight or obese accounted for 50.8% (n = 136 of 268) of children with co-morbidities. Proposed mechanisms explaining why obesity may be a risk factor for COVID-19/MIS-C include: an accumulation of inflammatory cells in adipose tissue, fat tissue-associated cytokines are proinflammatory, impaired respiratory function, and adipose cells have more SARS-CoV-2 binding receptors.

While children with COVID-19 present with upper respiratory symptoms, MIS-C is distinguishable by fever (100%), vomiting (68.2%), and abdominal pain/diarrhea (73.8%)The abdominal pain in MIS-C can be so severe that in several cases patients were presumed to have appendicitis. For instance, patients in studies by Belhadjer et al. and Dasgupta received urgent abdominal surgery, but ultimately found the patients had mesenteric lymphadenitis. In this review, further imaging of the abdomen (ultrasound, computed tomography, or magnetic resonance imaging) was performed in 14 of the 39 studies. Only one of those studies had a normal abdominal evaluation. More common findings included ascites (n = 27 individuals), intestinal/colonic inflammation (n = 16 individuals), and mesenteric adenopathy (n = 15 individuals). On one occasion, an 11-year old was diagnosed with pancreatitis secondary to SARS-CoV-2. This highlights the vast spectrum of gastrointestinal pathology in MIS-C.

### Appendiceal involvement in pediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome temporally associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2): a diagnostic challenge in the coronavirus disease (COVID) era [^3cb16ae0]. Pediatric Radiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Comparison of our findings with outcome of the review analysis of pooled data (Table 2) from similar studies shows that the abdominal inflammatory changes were much more common in our study (free fluid, 78% compared to 49%; mesenteric lymphadenopathy, 52% compared to 24%; mesenteric inflammation, 52% compared to 10%; ileal thickening, 35% compared to 18%; and cecum/ascending colon thickening, 35% compared to 8%). An important factor for this difference could be that most of our cases presented during the second wave in the UK when some of the imaging features were already established, compared to many of the studies from the review analysis, which were published from the period of the first wave.

Another important observation in our study is evidence of appendiceal involvement in 7/23 (30%) cases, which is contrary to the current literature on PIMS-TS (Figs. 1, 2, 3 and 4). In a routine clinical setting, acute appendicitis (enlarged appendix ≥ 6 mm) is commonly associated with peri-appendiceal fat-stranding, focal cecal apical thickening (arrowhead sign), adenopathy, fluid in right paracolic gutter or appendicolith. In our study, all cases with appendiceal thickening also had distal ileum (not limited to ileo-cecal junction) and cecum (circumferential wall thickening extending to involve the ascending colon in some cases) involvement, in addition to mesenteric inflammation, lymphadenopathy, and free fluid (Fig. 4).

### Mesenteric panniculitis: systematic review of cross-sectional imaging findings and risk of subsequent malignancy [^ad7c32e7]. European Radiology (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Mesenteric panniculitis (MP) describes inflammation of mesenteric fat and is manifest on CT scanning as a circumscribed region of increased mesenteric density, often exhibiting a mass-like effect, containing several lymph nodes, and engulfing mesenteric vessels. MP is known by a variety of alternative terms including 'mesenteric lipodystrophy', 'liposclerotic mesenteritis' and 'misty mesentery'. The latter term includes entities such as 'sclerosing mesenteritis' and 'retractile mesenteritis'. Such varied terminology reflects confusion regarding the precise definition of MP.

An association between MP and development of subsequent malignancy has been raised, suggesting MP is an important finding. Alternatively, others state there is no association between MP and malignancy. Lack of consensus regarding the clinical significance of MP thus presents radiologists with a diagnostic dilemma because MP is encountered frequently as an apparently incidental finding on cross-sectional imaging, usually abdominopelvic CT. Furthermore, referring clinicians will usually be unfamiliar with MP and will therefore look to the reporting radiologist for management guidance. To attempt to clarify the significance of MP in the face of apparently contradictory evidence we performed a systematic review of available medical literature, focusing on the cross-sectional imaging findings of MP and any association with development of subsequent malignancy.

### Multimodality imaging of indolent B cell lymphoma from diagnosis to transformation: what every radiologist should know [^f588ee06]. Insights Into Imaging (2019). Medium credibility.

Follicular lymphoma

Follicular lymphoma is the most common type of indolent B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), originating from centroblasts and centrocytes of germinal centers of the lymph nodes, the spleen, or the bone marrow and is characterized by several genetic mutations including the BCL2 translocation. Follicular lymphoma is graded according to the number of centroblasts present at high-power field (HPF) histologic examination, from grade 1, with 0–5 centroblasts per HPF, to grade 3, with more than 15 centroblasts per HPF. More than 90% of the diagnosed FL are grade 1 and 2.

On cross-sectional imaging, FL presents with multiple, deep, non-contiguous enlarged lymph nodes, homogeneously enhancing on CT or MR (Fig. 1). Intra-abdominal adenopathy in general does not cause gastrointestinal or genitourinary symptoms. The "sandwich sign", has been described in patients with mesenteric large confluent adenopathy on both sides of mesenteric vessels, with the nodal masses representing the buns and the vessels resembling the sandwich filling, giving the appearance of a hamburger. An increased number of lymph nodes should raise suspicion for early stage of FL. FL can present also with extranodal involvement presenting with organomegaly or focal lesions. The most common extranodal sites involved are the bone marrow, liver, lungs, and central nervous system, whereas involvement of the thyroid, parotid gland, breast, testis, orbits, skin, and subcutaneous tissues is unusual. Splenic involvement can be in the form of splenomegaly and FDG-avid lesions on PET/CT, T2-hyperintense homogeneously enhancing lesions on MR or hypodense focal lesions on CT.

### Prognostic characteristics of patients with colorectal cancer who have benign mesenteric lymph node enlargement: a multi-institutional cohort study [^f1f1b09b]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

The characteristics of patients with colorectal cancer who have benign mesenteric lymph node enlargement are not well documented.

Objective

The aim of this study is to assess the clinical and prognostic significance of benign mesenteric lymph node enlargement in patients with colorectal cancer.

Design

This is a prospective cohort study.

Setting

This study was conducted at multitertiary institutions.

Patients

We included 601 patients with stage 0, I, and II colorectal cancer in Tianjin, Shandong, and Zhejiang from January 2010 to April 2014. Patients underwent curative surgery and were separated into 2 groups by the presence of benign mesenteric lymph node enlargement: the enlargement group (n = 275) and the control group (n = 326).

Main Outcome Measures

Univariate log rank and multivariate Cox regression analyses were constructed to identify risk factors for recurrence and mortality.

Results

The risk of recurrence in the enlargement group after curative resection was significantly lower than in the control group, with the 1-, 3-, and 5-year disease-free survival rates being 97.1%, 91.6%, and 86.9% in the enlargement group and 95.7%, 86.2%, and 78.2% in the control group (p = 0.004). The postoperative 1-, 3-, and 5-year overall survival rates were 99.6%, 94.9%, and 90.5% in the enlargement group and 99.4%, 91.4%, and 82.1% in the control group (p = 0.001). Patients in the enlargement group had a higher percentage of patients at a younger age, family tumor history, right-sided tumors, and larger tumor size compared with the control group. For patients in the enlargement group, no significant correlation was observed between the number of enlarged lymph nodes and disease-free survival or overall survival (p = 0.113 and 0.386). Adjusted Cox regression model showed that benign mesenteric lymph node enlargement was an independent prognostic risk factor for both disease-free survival (HR, 0.587; 95% CI, 0.399–0.861; p = 0.007) and overall survival (HR, 0.506; 95% CI, 0.328–0.779; p = 0.002).

Limitations

No immunological results could be compared with clinicopathological findings.

Conclusions

The study indicates that benign mesenteric lymph node enlargement can be a useful positive factor in predicting recurrence and long-term survival concerning patients with colorectal cancer. See Video Abstract at http://links.lww.com/DCR/B785.

Caractersticas Pronsticas De Los Pacientes Portadores De Cncer Colorrectal Con Agrandamiento Benigno De Los Ganglios Linfticos Mesentricos Un Estudio De Cohorte Multiinstitucional

### Mesenteric lymphadenopathy as a cause of abdominal pain in children with lobar or segmental pneumonia [^cb37cfa7]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2003). Low credibility.

We investigated whether mesenteric lymphadenopathy could be a cause of abdominal pain in children with lobar or segmental pneumonia. The study population consisted of 1)119 consecutive children with lobar pneumonia, older than 4 years of age, and 2) 31 healthy controls. Demographic, clinical, inflammatory, and radiographic data were recorded in all patients. All study subjects underwent abdominal ultrasound, focusing on the identification of mesenteric lymphadenopathy. One month later, a follow-up ultrasound was performed in patients with enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes at the initial examination. Forty patients complaining of abdominal pain were included in group 1, while the remaining 79 were in group 2. The two groups of patients did not significantly differ regarding their demographic, clinical (other than abdominal pain), and radiographic indices. In contrast, enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes with a sagittal diameter of at least 10 mm were identified significantly more commonly in the children of group 1 (P = 0.001). The association of enlarged lymph nodes with the presence of abdominal pain remained significant when the data were analyzed through multiple regression analysis (odds raio, 1.47; 95% confidence interval, 3–44). Enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes were found in a significantly lower ratio of healthy controls (3/31) compared to that observed in group 1 (P = 0.003). In all patients who were followed up, mesenteric lymph nodes had either decreased or were not detectable. Our findings indicate that mesenteric lymphadenopathy might be considered as a mechanism responsible for the development of abdominal pain in a relatively high percentage of children with pneumonia.

### The mesentery in Crohn's disease: friend or foe? [^1d10e0ff]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This article assesses the role of the mesentery in Crohn's disease.

Recent Findings

The mesentery is centrally positioned both anatomically and physiologically. Overlapping mesenteric and submucosal mesenchymal contributions are important in the pathobiology of Crohn's disease. Mesenteric contributions explain the topographic distribution of Crohn's disease in general and mucosal disease in particular. Operative strategies that are mesenteric based (i.e. mesocolic excision) may reduce rates of postoperative recurrence.

Summary

The net effect of mesenteric events in Crohn's disease is pathologic. This can be targeted by operative means.

### FDG-PET / CT assessment of misty mesentery: feasibility for distinguishing viable mesenteric malignancy from stable conditions [^cb49380a]. European Journal of Radiology (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose

"Misty mesentery" is a CT appearance of mesenteric fat changes with increased attenuation often existing with swelled mesenteric lymph nodes. We evaluated diagnostic performance of FDG-PET/CT in distinguishing viable malignant disorders from benign conditions in misty mesentery.

Materials and Methods

4236 FDG-PET/CT images were reviewed to identify patients with appearances of misty mesentery. Only the initial examinations were evaluated. Patients undergoing chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy within 3 months, patients with bulky mesenteric mass, and patients without follow-up examinations were excluded. Maximum short-axis diameter of mesenteric nodules (Diam-max) and maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) for mesenteric abnormalities were measured, and the diagnostic performance to differentiate between viable malignancy and stable lesions was assessed by receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, based on final diagnoses obtained by histology or follow-up examinations. Their significance was assessed by multivariate logistic regression.

Results

71 studies met the inclusion criteria with confirmed diagnoses (13 viable malignancies; 58 stable lesions). Of the 13 malignant cases, 12 were lymphoma. ROC curves indicated an optimal Diam-max cut-off value of > 10mm and SUVmax cut-off of ≥ 3.0, with area under the curve of 0.961 and 0.926, respectively. Using the optimal Diam-max cut-off, sensitivity and specificity were 69% and 98%, respectively. Using the optimal SUVmax cut-off, they were 85% and 98%, respectively. The combination of either Diam-max > 10mm or SUVmax ≥ 3.0 had a sensitivity of 92%. Both Diam-max and SUVmax were significant independent factors for predicting malignancy.

Conclusions

FDG-PET/CT is feasible for identifying viable malignancy in misty mesentery.

Stage II with extensive mesenteric disease or stage III–IV — Interim staging (after 2–4 cycles) is recommended; if interim restaging demonstrates a CR or PR, continuation of first-line therapy to a total of 6 cycles followed by EOT restaging is recommended, whereas no response or progressive disease (after 2–4 cycles of first-line therapy) should be managed as described below for relapsed or refractory disease. PET/CT at interim restaging can lead to increased false positives and should be carefully considered; if PET/CT is performed and positive, rebiopsy is recommended before changing course of treatment. After EOT restaging, observation is preferred for patients with CR, ISRT to initially bulky disease or isolated skeletal sites can be considered, and patients with PR after completion of initial therapy or with progressive disease are treated as described below for relapsed or refractory disease; HDT/ASCR is therefore not recommended as first-line consolidation.

Mesenteric lymphadenopathy has been rarely reported in pediatric patients with Gaucher disease, developing despite the enzyme replacement therapy. The clinical implication of this condition is undetermined, with no consensus on treatment strategies. However, this condition can reflect the progression of Gaucher disease. Moreover, it can be accompanied by the serious complication, protein-losing enteropathy. Our experience underlines the importance of careful monitoring and early intervention for mesenteric lymphadenopathy, especially in pediatric patients with neuronopathic Gaucher disease.

### Diagnostic significance of mesenteric lymph node involvement in proximal small bowel Crohn's disease [^4041ddc1]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background:

The diagnosis of proximal small bowel involvement in Crohn's disease (CD) can be challenging at magnetic resonance enterography (MRE). The inflammatory process in CD can be associated with peri-intestinal inflammatory reactions, including the presence of inflamed mesenteric lymph nodes.

Objectives:

To evaluate the significance of inflamed mesenteric lymph nodes adjacent to the jejunum at MRE in CD and the association with proximal bowel disease as detected by video capsule endoscopy (VCE).

Design:

This retrospective study was performed in two tertiary medical centres, and included 64 patients with CD who underwent MRE as well as VCE within 1 year.

Methods:

Data were collected for examinations performed between August 2013 and February 2021. MRE images were independently reviewed by radiologists who were blinded to the clinical data. Association between the presence of mesenteric lymph nodes adjacent to jejunum at MRE and disease activity according to VCE Lewis scores of proximal small bowel was examined.

Results:

VCE detected proximal disease in 24/64 patients (37.5%). Presence of regional lymph nodes in the jejunal mesentery was significantly associated with jejunal disease as seen on VCE (p < 0.001). Of the 20 patients who had proximal mesenteric lymph nodes at MRE, 15 (75%) had jejunal disease at VCE (sensitivity, 62.5%; specificity, 87.5%; and negative and positive predictive values, 79.5 and 75%, respectively). The number of regional lymph nodes was positively correlated with jejunal disease (mean: 2.63 ± 2.90 versus 0.78 ± 2.60, p = 0.01). Other MRE features of lymph nodes were not significantly predictive of jejunal CD.

Conclusion:

In patients with CD, inflamed regional lymph nodes in the jejunal mesentery at MRE can be valuable to suggest proximal small bowel disease, even when bowel wall features at imaging do not suggest disease involvement.

Plain language summary

The diagnosis of proximal small bowel involvement in Crohn's disease (CD) can be challenging at magnetic resonance enterography (MRE). We analysed MRE examinations in patients with CD for the presence of lymph nodes adjacent to the proximal small bowel. We included 64 patients with CD who had MRE examinations and video capsule endoscopy (VCE) examinations within 1 year. Of 64 patients, 24 had proximal small bowel disease according to VCE. We found that of 20 patients who had regional mesenteric lymph nodes in the jejunal mesentery at MRE, 15 had proximal bowel disease involvement. We also found that patients with jejunal disease had a larger number of regional lymph nodes compared to patients without jejunal disease. All but one patient had normal appearing bowel at MRE. But, using regional mesenteric lymphadenopathy at MRE as an indicator for disease, 15/24 (62.5%) patients with proximal small bowel disease were detected. We therefore conclude that regional mesenteric lymph nodes assessment at MRE can aid diagnose proximal bowel disease, even when the proximal bowel looks normal at imaging. Presence of proximal mesenteric lymph nodes at MRE in patients with CD possibly warrant further investigation of the proximal small bowel by endoscopic measures.

### Kikuchi-fujimoto's disease involving mesenteric nodes: a report and review of literature [^2fd30222]. BMJ Case Reports (2011). Medium credibility.

An adolescent boy underwent laparoscopic evaluation with persisting fever associated with colicky abdominal pain of about 3 weeks duration after a CT study of his abdomen revealed mesenteric adenopathy. Histopathological evaluation of the excised mesenteric nodes showed features of histiocytic necrotising lymphadenopathy suggestive of Kikuchi-Fujimoto lymphadenopathy which was confirmed on immunehistochemistry staining. Kikuchi-Fujimoto's disease involving the mesenteric nodes is extremely unusual and can be confounding with a mistaken diagnosis of and prolonged treatment for tuberculosis. The authors present a case of Kikuchi-Fujimoto's disease involving the mesenteric lymph nodes and discuss the various aspects of diagnosis and management of the case along with a review of published literature.

### Diagnostic significance of mesenteric lymph node involvement in proximal small bowel Crohn's disease [^94ae581e]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this study, we evaluated the relationship between regional lymph nodes MRE features and their possible predictive value of jejunal CD. There are several important findings: (1) Presence of inflamed regional lymph nodes in patients with CD was significantly associated with jejunal involvement at VCE. (2) Without assessing lymph node involvement, MRE had low sensitivity to detect proximal bowel involvement. (3) There was no significant association between regional lymph nodes and disease activity according to Lewis scores at VCE.

One of the challenges in MRE when evaluating CD is proximal small bowel disease detection. This is usually due to the suboptimal distention of jejunal loops. It specifically applies to early disease characterized by mucosal changes only. Improving the ability of non-endoscopic methods for proximal disease detection is an unmet need in IBD diagnostics. Here, using lymph nodes MRE features, additional 14 cases of proximal disease were accurately detected, increasing the detection rate of proximal bowel disease at MRE from 4% to 62%.

### Evaluation of imaging findings in gastrointestinal anisakiasis in emergency CT and ultrasound [^c505d962]. Insights Into Imaging (2023). Medium credibility.

In our opinion, this variation could be associated with differences in the patient selection methods: the previous series are usually small-sized and specifically oriented to cases of intestinal anisakiasis demonstrated by ultrasound. If we only consider the cases of our sample with wall thickening, results for ascites and wall stratification get closer to other studies (up to 72% and 50%, respectively). The inclusion in our series of patients with ultrasound without findings but pathology visible in CT makes the comparison difficult, but it could offer more extrapolative data. In addition, as far as we know, the presence of adenopathies or the oedema of mesenteric fat has not been assessed previously.

It is noteworthy that the wall thickening due to the Kerckring valves (first hypoechogenic layer from the lumen, corresponding to the muscularis mucosae) with preservation of the stratification in layers seems to be a relatively characteristic finding (Fig. 6). However, it is not specific, since it can be observed in other entities such as mesenteric venous thrombosis, congestive heart failure, angioedema, enteral lupus or radical enteritis.

### IKK2 controls the inflammatory potential of tissue-resident regulatory T cells in a murine gain of function model [^929139f2]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Next we examined mice for evidence of generalised immune dysregulation. Foxp3 deficiency and Treg functional defects are associated with early onset and marked generalised lymphadenopathy –. This phenotype is not conferred by the Ikbkb mut mutation, as mesenteric lymph nodes were similar in size in both mutants and Ikbkb +/+ mice (Fig. S 5a, b). Mesenteric lymph nodes drain the colon and small intestine where we found no evidence of spontaneous inflammation (Fig. S 5c). In humans, lymphadenopathy is observed in rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis, where it occurs in lymph nodes draining inflamed joints. Interestingly, we observed inguinal, brachial, and cervical lymphadenopathy in mutant mice, more marked in Ikbkb mut/mut than Ikbkb mut/+ mice (Fig. S 5d–f). Thus, lymphadenopathy appears to be located at sites draining tissue-specific inflammation, and thus reactive rather than a consequence of generalised lymphoproliferation. Absence of inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract represents further evidence against Treg deficiency as the cause of pathology.

### Mesenteric panniculitis [^ed34566f]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

Background

Mesenteric panniculitis is a rare and benign acute and chronic inflammatory and fibrotic process that affects predominantly the small and less frequently (20%) the large intestine mesenteric fat. It may more rarely involve retroperitoneal, pelvic and peripancreatic fat. It is more common in men, with a male-to-female ratio of 2–3:1, and it is more common in Caucasian men. As of 2016, less than 300 cases have been reported around the world and none from South Africa. It may be associated with a variety of conditions such as prior abdominal surgery, malignancy, autoimmune disease, infections, gall stones among others.

Presenting symptoms are non-specific and include abdominal pain, bloating, weight loss and intestinal obstruction. CT scan may reveal soft tissue masses, prominent lymph nodes, inflammation and/or fibrosis of the mesentery. Greasy ring signal and pseudocapsule findings are considered more specific CT findings, but biopsy is still required to confirm the diagnosis. The aim of this case report is to raise awareness among clinicians of this rare condition.

### The gauge of nodes: tiny to buckshotty… [^7ff25527]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

To the Editor. — Palpable but clinically unimportant lymph nodes are commonly described as "shotty, " a word defined1 as "hard and round like a pellet of shot. " However, American shot ranges in diameter from 1. 25 mm for No. 12 to 9. 14 mm for 000 buck-shot. 2 A hard node almost 1 cm in diameter is clearly abnormal and usually requires a biopsy, while one 1. 25 mm in size would be impalpable. It would be preferable to describe nodes using their diameters in centimeters, in addition to their consistency, mobility, and adherence to other nodes. If a node is too small to measure accurately and is considered clinically unimportant, it should be described as "tiny" rather than "shotty, " a term so imprecise as to be meaningless. Stolinsky DC.

### AGA clinical practice update on sclerosing mesenteritis: commentary [^877f9f48]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2025). High credibility.

Sclerosing mesenteritis (SM) CT imaging criteria and biopsy considerations — CT diagnostic criteria consist of: (1) a hazy mesenteric fat mass displacing intestine; (2) higher attenuation in the mesenteric fat mass than adjacent mesentery, but no enhancement with intravenous contrast; (3) the presence of lymph nodes < 1 cm; (4) a hypattenuated halo sign around central vessels; and (5) a thin surrounding fibrotic pseudocapsule; the presence of 3 or more of these features is suggestive of SM, while a hazy mesentery without nodes, halo sign, or pseudocapsule is not diagnostic and typically does not require follow-up; although definitive diagnosis requires biopsy, in patients with characteristic imaging and no alarm features (fever, night sweats, unintentional weight loss) a presumptive diagnosis can be made without a biopsy in most cases, whereas calcifications and retraction of the surrounding bowel typically warrants biopsy unless an association with IgG4 disease can be established.

### Evaluation of imaging findings in gastrointestinal anisakiasis in emergency CT and ultrasound [^8a189785]. Insights Into Imaging (2023). Medium credibility.

Images acquisition

All the radiological studies were made in a single centre using the same equipment. The abdominopelvic ultrasounds (Epiq 5, Philips) were done by the on-call radiologist with a convex 5 MHz probe for general assessment and linear 12 MHz probe for the intestinal assessment in case of observing pathological segments. For the CTs, equipment with 128 detectors (Somatom Definition AS, Siemens) was used; in all cases, the same protocol was applied, with the acquisition of the study 70 s after the administering 70 mL of intravenous iodine-based contrast (Iomeprol 400 mg/ml) at 2 ml/s through the antecubital vein (axial reconstruction with a slide thickness of 3 mm; 1 mm thickness available for coronal or sagittal reconstruction on demand); in some cases, depending on the initial clinical suspicion, additional phases were acquired.

Interpretation of images

Two radiologists with prior experience in abdominal radiology (10 and 6 years) independently reviewed the images of each study (conventional radiology, ultrasound and CT) according to previously established criteria. Since all the patients had a confirmed diagnosis of anisakiasis as an inclusion criterion, the reviewers were not blind to this information. In the conventional radiology, the presence of focal or generalised dilation of the stomach and/or the bowel loops was assessed. In both CT and abdominopelvic ultrasound, the presence of signs that have been related to anisakiasis in the literature in the affected gastrointestinal segments was assessed: wall thickening or of folds/valves; presence of wall hyperdensity (CT) or stratification (CT or ultrasound); ascitic fluid (local or generalised); perienteric fat stranding (CT) or hyperechogenicity of mesenteric fat (ultrasound); engorgement of the adjacent mesenteric vessels (CT); and regional adenopathies. Bowel dilation and its degree (calibre in mm), intraluminal fluid and associated complication signs (obstruction, pneumoperitoneum, etc.) were also assessed. In case of doubt, a conclusion was reached through consensus.

### Mesenteric panniculitis: systematic review of cross-sectional imaging findings and risk of subsequent malignancy [^91193a2e]. European Radiology (2016). Low credibility.

Objectives

Systematic review to determine any association between imaging features of idiopathic mesenteric panniculitis (MP) and subsequent malignancy.

Methods

Two researchers searched primary literature independently for imaging studies of MP. They extracted data focusing on methodology for unbiased patient accrual and capability to determine a link between MP and subsequent malignancy. They noted imaging features of MP. Data were accrued and meta-analysis intended.

Results

Fourteen of 675 articles were eligible; 1,226 patients. Only three (21%) accrued patients prospectively. Twelve (86%) studies described CT features. Follow-up varied widely; 1 month to 8 years. Prevalence of MP was influenced by accrual: 0.2% for keyword search versus 1.7% for consecutive series. Accrual bias affected nine (64%) studies. 458 (38%) of 1,209 patients had malignancy at accrual but varied widely (8–89%), preventing meta-analysis. Sixty (6.4%) of 933 patients developed new malignancy subsequently, also varying widely (0–11%). Of just four studies that determined the proportion of unselected, consecutive patients with MP developing subsequent malignancy, three were retrospective and the fourth excluded patients with lymphadenopathy, likely excluding patients with MP.

Conclusion

Studies were heterogeneous, with biased accrual. No available study can determine an association between MP and subsequent malignancy with certainty.

Key Points

- Our systematic review of mesenteric panniculitis found that imaging studies were biased.

- Spectrum and recruitment bias was largely due to retrospective study designs.

- No study could confirm a certain link between mesenteric panniculitis and subsequent malignancy.

- Excessive methodological heterogeneity precluded meaningful meta-analysis.

- High-quality research linking mesenteric panniculitis imaging features and subsequent malignancy is needed.

### Diagnostic significance of mesenteric lymph node involvement in proximal small bowel Crohn's disease [^f38214dc]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

The diagnosis of proximal small bowel involvement in Crohn's disease (CD) can be challenging at magnetic resonance enterography (MRE). The inflammatory process in CD can be associated with peri-intestinal inflammatory reactions, including the presence of inflamed mesenteric lymph nodes.

Objectives

To evaluate the significance of inflamed mesenteric lymph nodes adjacent to the jejunum at MRE in CD and the association with proximal bowel disease as detected by video capsule endoscopy (VCE).

Design

This retrospective study was performed in two tertiary medical centres, and included 64 patients with CD who underwent MRE as well as VCE within 1year.

Methods

Data were collected for examinations performed between August 2013 and February 2021. MRE images were independently reviewed by radiologists who were blinded to the clinical data. Association between the presence of mesenteric lymph nodes adjacent to jejunum at MRE and disease activity according to VCE Lewis scores of proximal small bowel was examined.

Results

VCE detected proximal disease in 24/64 patients (37.5%). Presence of regional lymph nodes in the jejunal mesentery was significantly associated with jejunal disease as seen on VCE (p < 0.001). Of the 20 patients who had proximal mesenteric lymph nodes at MRE, 15 (75%) had jejunal disease at VCE (sensitivity, 62.5%; specificity, 87.5%; and negative and positive predictive values, 79.5 and 75%, respectively). The number of regional lymph nodes was positively correlated with jejunal disease (mean: 2.63 ± 2.90 versus 0.78 ± 2.60, p = 0.01). Other MRE features of lymph nodes were not significantly predictive of jejunal CD.

Conclusion

In patients with CD, inflamed regional lymph nodes in the jejunal mesentery at MRE can be valuable to suggest proximal small bowel disease, even when bowel wall features at imaging do not suggest disease involvement.

### 68Ga-DOTATATE PET / CT distinguishes neuroendocrine tumor mesenteric lymph node metastasis from an extensive IgG4-positive fibrosis surrounding It [^6196665d]. Clinical Nuclear Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Abstract

A 56-year-old woman presented with right iliac fossa pain. Abdominal CT showed a mesenteric mass in the right iliac fossa, adjacent to the vena cava inferior and right ureter. Biopsy of the mass revealed a well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumor. 68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT showed strong somatostatin receptor expression only within in a small, central area of this mesenteric mass, with faint 68Ga-DOTATATE uptake in the majority of this mesenteric mass. Pathology revealed an IgG4-positive storiform fibrosis surrounding a mesenteric adenopathy. 68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT discriminates between neuroendocrine tumor lymph node metastases and fibrosis, hereby avoiding potential sampling error of tumor biopsies and guiding surgical approach.

### MR enterography correlates highly with colonoscopy and histology for both distal ileal and colonic Crohn's disease in 310 patients [^61f53983]. European Journal of Radiology (2012). Low credibility.

Background and Aims

To evaluate the efficacy of MR enterography (MRE) in patients with known or suspected Crohn's disease without the use of anti-peristaltic pharmacologic agents compared to colonoscopy and histology.

Methods

A retrospective review of 850 consecutive patients who underwent routine MRE to evaluate known or suspected Crohn's disease was performed. Of these, 310 patients also underwent colonoscopy with biopsy(s) within 90 days. The results of the MRE were compared to the colonoscopy and pathology reports to determine the presence or absence of disease in evaluable bowel segments. Individual imaging parameters (including wall thickening, enhancement, T2 signal, mesenteric vascular prominence and adenopathy) were also separately analyzed to determine their independent predictive value.

Results

In 310 patients, the overall sensitivity and specificity of MRE (using endoscopy as a gold standard) were 85% and 80% respectively (kappa = 0.65). The sensitivity of MRE for detection of pathologically severe disease was 87% in the terminal ileum (TI) and 88% in the colon. In the subset of 162 patients who underwent colonoscopy within 30 days of MRE, the overall sensitivity remained 85% but the specificity increased to 85% (kappa = 0.69). Wall thickening and abnormal enhancement were sensitive indicators of Crohn's disease (75% and 78%), while abnormal T2 signal, mesenteric vascular prominence and adenopathy were specific (86%, 91% and 93%).

Conclusion

MRE compares favorably to colonoscopy for evaluation of known or suspected Crohn's disease noninvasively and without the exposure to ionizing radiation associated with CT enterography (CTE).

### Celiac axis and superior mesenteric artery: danger zone for left nephrectomy [^3620de0f]. Journal of Endourology (2008). Low credibility.

We report two cases of iatrogenic occlusion of the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) and celiac axis (CA) during left nephrectomy. A patient with a urothelial carcinoma (open surgery) and one with coralliform calculi (laparoscopy) experienced injury to both the SMA and/or CA due to bulky perihilar adenopathy and kidney adherence to surrounding tissue. The cancer patient survived after fast repair. Repair was delayed in the second patient who subsequently died. It is essential to identify each arterial branch carefully on the preoperative CT-scan to identify any duplicate renal arteries and avoid mistaking the SMA and/or CA for the renal artery.

Stage I or Stage II disease (contiguous) — initial therapy and follow-up: ISRT (24–30 Gy) is the preferred treatment option, with ISRT in combination with CD20-directed monoclonal antibody (mAb) with or without chemotherapy included as an alternate option; CD20-directed mAb with or without chemotherapy can be considered in selected patients with bulky intra-abdominal or mesenteric stage I disease, and active surveillance may be appropriate when potential toxicity of ISRT or systemic therapy outweighs potential clinical benefit. No further treatment is necessary for patients achieving CR or partial response (PR) to initial therapy, and clinical follow-up with a complete history and physical exam and laboratory assessment is recommended every 3 to 6 months for the first 5 years, and then annually (or as clinically indicated) thereafter; surveillance imaging with CT scans can be performed no more than every 6 months up to the first 2 years following completion of treatment, and then no more than annually thereafter. For disease not responding to initial ISRT, treatment should follow stage III or IV guidance; for disease not responding to initial CD20-directed mAb with or without chemotherapy, second-line or subsequent therapy should be used, and rebiopsy to rule out histologic transformation is recommended prior to the initiation of second-line or subsequent therapy.

When symptomatic, the abdominal pain on examination should correspond to the SM lesion on imaging and is treated with anti-inflammatory medications tailored to disease severity and clinical response. Biopsy is not required if the SM meets 3 of the 5 CT criteria reported by Coulier (discussed previously) and lacks features of more aggressive disease or malignancy.

Radiological Findings

All but one child underwent abdominal ultrasonography (52 [80.0%]) or tomography (12 [18.5%]) evaluation. One child presented with acute abdomen and underwent urgent surgery without imaging. The majority of patients showed a radiological feature characterized by diffuse peritoneal effusion, mesenteric fat inflammation, multiple mesenteric lymphadenopathies, or intestinal wall thickening (Table 2). In children receiving a clinical diagnosis of appendicitis, imaging generally confirmed the presence of peritoneal effusion and appendicular thickening, although the median appendicular diameter (when available) was 5 mm.

Twenty-one patients (32.3%) showed single or multiple uneven fluid collection frequently localized in the lower right quadrant or subhepatic and retrovesical area, and was usually referred to as abdominal abscesses (Figure 3 A). Figure 3 B depicts the frequency and localization of most reported radiological findings.

### Primary and secondary tumors of the peritoneum: key imaging features and differential diagnosis with surgical and pathological correlation [^c44b865a]. Insights Into Imaging (2023). Medium credibility.

Lymphoma

Peritoneal spread of lymphomas is rare and is known as peritoneal lymphomatosis. The most frequent origin is a preexisting non-Hodgkin B-cell Lymphoma. Primary lymphoma of the peritoneum without visceral involvement is known as primary effusion lymphoma, and it is a rare entity found in immunocompromised patients, almost exclusively in patients with human immunodeficiency virus.

Imaging features on CT and MRI mimic peritoneal carcinomatosis, with a diffuse thickening of peritoneal folds, multiple omental and mesenteric nodules and masses, infiltration of small bowel mesentery and ascites. But there are some additional findings that, when present, help to reach an accurate diagnosis: mesenteric and retroperitoneal lymphadenopathies that encase mesenteric vessels, presence of mildly enhancing homogeneous bulky masses, wall thickening of long segments of small bowel loops, hepatosplenomegaly and homogeneous hepatic or splenic nodules (Figs. 25, 26).

This gap in available data highlights the need for evidence‐based treatment approaches since (cumulative) digestive damage might be underestimated by established scores such as the CD activity index 20. Thus, due to the variance in disease course, objective histological hallmarks for grading disease severity would be favourable for decision‐making 8. A recent study conducted by Randolph et al. 13 has revived interest in the alteration of lymphatic vessels in CD and shown that B‐cell‐rich aggregates resembling tertiary lymphoid organs impinge on lymphatic collecting vessels adjacent to mesenteric lymph nodes. These alterations might be causative or a result of secondary changes due to chronic inflammation. With respect to this, more extensive resection of the mesentery has been suggested to decrease rates of surgical recurrence after ileocolic resection, although a prospective evaluation of these results is lacking to date 14. Taken together, granulomas in the mesentery might be caused by excessive inflammation and their presence or absence could allow 'grading' of disease severity. In contrast, granulomas in the bowel wall seem to be less specific for a complicated disease course/disease duration. This is in line with a meta‐analysis that found higher reoperation rates and faster recurrence in granulomatous CD 12. Using a more differentiated approach, Li et al. 11 recently showed that mesenteric granulomas had a prognostic impact on endoscopic and surgical recurrence after index ileocaecal resection while intestinal granulomas did not. However, the postoperative utilization of immunosuppression was relatively low in their study and the impact on recurrence rate is not stated. In our study we have independently validated the findings of Li et al. in a larger and more generalized cohort of CD patients. However, the higher utilization rate of anti‐TNF therapy in did not reduce the risk of recurrence in our retrospective cohort. These findings are in line with a nationwide cohort study from Denmark that evaluated a total of 48 967 individuals and did not find a 'convincing surgery‐sparing effect' of higher rates of use of immunosuppression 21. In contrast, several prospective studies in small cohorts of patients undergoing index ileocaecal resection have shown benefits for early initiation of anti‐TNF therapy with regard to endoscopic and surgical recurrence rates 5, 6, 7, 22. These discrepant findings in the published literature can probably be attributed to the different inclusion criteria, and collectively indicate that future studies should focus on improving reoperation rates in high‐risk patients. In addition, these discrepancies between 'real‐world' studies and controlled trials emphasize the need for studies in patients suffering from more complicated diseases (e.g. a second or third surgical intervention).

### Idiopathic sclerosing mesenteritis in paediatrics: report of a successfully treated case and a review of literature [^e0d74953]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2010). Low credibility.

Most cases are diagnosed on surgical intervention, but advances in imaging techniques have helped identify features that may suggest a diagnosis of ISM. The various imaging patterns reported in children has been summarised in Table 2. Such imaging may provide valuable clues to diagnosis, clinical response and progression. Plain roentgenograms are usually non specific. However small-bowel series often show separation of loops with kinking and angulation of the small bowel, suggesting a serosal process. Folds may be thickened because of either extension of the mesenteric process into the submucosa or edema from lymphatic obstruction. The colon may occasionally be involved, with narrowing and rigidity; thumb printing also has been reported. Ultrasonography may help delineate normal from inflammatory mesenteric fat, the latter demonstrating a homogenous echogenicity. It has been reported in only 3 of the pediatric cases revealing a homogeneous low echoic mass in the involved areas. The CT appearance of sclerosing mesenteritis may vary from subtle increased attenuation in the mesentery to a solid soft-tissue mass. There may be preservation of fat around the mesenteric vessels, a phenomenon that is referred to as the "fat ring sign", a finding that may help distinguish sclerosing mesenteritis from other mesenteric processes such as lymphomas. In addition, Sabate et al described the presence of a tumoral pseudocapsule in 50% of patients with mesenteric panniculitis. Our case showed features of severe diffuse mesenteric adenopathy on CT. MRI usually reveals a low signal suggesting a mature fibrotic reaction. T2-weighted or fat-suppressed pulse sequences may help distinguish benign end stage fibrofatty proliferation from malignant tumours such as lymphoma. Assessment of large to medium-sized vessels depicting the flow patterns and the presence of collaterals is also possible with MR imaging. MRI findings are reported in only 2 children with evidence of low signal intensities suggesting fibrosis in one case. In our case, a young child, movement artefact degraded images on MR making interpretation difficult.

### Diagnostic significance of mesenteric lymph node involvement in proximal small bowel Crohn's disease [^bdc4b222]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Regional lymph nodes at MRE were significantly associated with jejunal disease at VCE (p < 0.001). Of the 20 patients who had mesenteric lymph nodes at LUQ, 15 (75%) had jejunal disease at VCE. Out of 44 patients who did not have mesenteric lymph node involvement at LUQ, 35 (79.5%) did not have jejunal disease at VCE. LUQ mesenteric lymph node involvement therefore had 62.5% (15/24) sensitivity, 87.5% (35/40) specificity, 75% (15/20) PPV, and 79.5% (35/44) NPV for detection of jejunal CD.

The number of regional lymph nodes was positively correlated with jejunal disease (mean: 2.63 ± 2.90 versus 0.78 ± 2.60, p = 0.01). Frequency of T2-weighted hyperintensity (14/15 versus 5/5, p = 0.55) and enhancement (11/15 versus 5/5 p = 0.13) were not associated with jejunal disease. SAD and ADC values did not reveal a significant correlation to disease (mean SAD: 0.8 ± 0.24 cm versus 0.82 ± 0.22 cm, p = 0.87; mean ADC: 1.57 ± 0.50 versus 1.17 ± 0.11, p = 0.20). The MRE features of regional lymph nodes in patients with and without jejunal disease are detailed in Table 2.

Table 2.
MRE regional lymph nodes features.

No significant association was found between mean regional Lewis scores at VCE and regional lymph nodes at MRE (mean Lewis score: 886.07 ± 1138.68 versus 367.22 ± 237.16, p = 0.11). Figures 1 and 2 demonstrate the examples of MRE exams in patients with jejunal CD according to VCE.

### Mesenteric panniculitis: a paraneoplastic phenomenon? [^04772d9a]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Mesenteric panniculitis is an inflammatory condition of mesenteric adipose tissue with characteristic features on abdominal CT imaging. Although its cause is unknown, it has been associated with malignancy.

Objective

The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of malignancy in patients identified as having mesenteric panniculitis on CT imaging and to identify demographic, clinical, and radiological features that may predict an unknown underlying malignancy.

Design

This study is a retrospective analysis of medical records and imaging.

Setting

This study was conducted at Christchurch Hospital, Canterbury District Health Board, New Zealand.

Patients

Individuals with mesenteric panniculitis on abdominal CT imaging performed between 2003 and 2010 were included.

Results

One hundred eighteen (92 male; median age, 61 years; range, 20–88 years) patients were identified with mesenteric panniculitis. Malignancy was identified in 45 patients (38%) (34 male). The most common malignancies were colorectal (14), lymphoma (13), and urogenital tract (7). Malignancies were diagnosed after the detection of mesenteric panniculitis in 13 patients. Univariate analysis of demographic, clinical, and radiological features revealed that lymph node size > 12 mm (relative risk 4.5 (CI 1.4–14.6); p = 0.0266) and the absence of the fat ring sign (relative risk 0.6 (0.3–1.1); p = 0.047) were associated with the subsequent diagnosis of malignancy in patients with mesenteric panniculitis.

Limitations

This review was limited by its retrospective nature and the small number of individuals with diagnosis of malignancy after the detection of mesenteric panniculitis.

Conclusion

Mesenteric panniculitis is often associated with an underlying malignancy. In most cases, malignancy is diagnosed before mesenteric panniculitis. Lymph node size (> 12 mm) and the absence of the fat ring sign were identified as predictors of subsequent diagnosis of malignancy in patients with mesenteric panniculitis. Identification of mesenteric panniculitis on imaging should prompt an awareness for possible malignancy in these patients.

### Imaging of chronic granulomatous disease in children [^ac432b29]. Radiographics (2005). Low credibility.

Chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) is a rare immunodeficiency disorder. The inability of phagocytic cells to kill catalase-positive organisms, such as Staphylococcus and Aspergillus species, causes recurrent infections, persistent inflammation, and granuloma formation. The imaging findings in nine cases of CGD were studied. Recurrent pulmonary infection was the most common abnormality (seven cases). Its complications included pulmonary abscesses, bronchiectasis, mediastinal abscesses, osteomyelitis, sepsis, and brain abscesses. Suppurative cervical adenitis was the second most common abnormality (four cases) and was also the presenting abnormality in the youngest patient (aged 31 days). Abdominal manifestations included hepatosplenomegaly, recurrent hepatic and splenic abscesses, necrotic mesenteric adenopathy, and gastric outlet obstruction. Osteomyelitis occurred in two cases secondary to hematogenous spread or spread of contiguous infection from the lung. Persistent infections led to formation of chronic inflammatory masses and granulomas in five cases. With improvements in therapy, the prognosis of CGD patients has improved and the general consensus is that most patients will survive into adulthood. Hence, radiologists are more likely to encounter the complications of CGD and should familiarize themselves with the spectrum of imaging findings.

### Abdominal kikuchi-fujimoto lymphadenopathy: an uncommon presentation of a rare disease [^02f1e192]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). High credibility.

A 34-year-old man presented to our hospital with a 5-day history of progressive abdominal pain and fever. A CT scan identified extensive mesenteric lymphadenopathy. Initial diagnostic tests were inconclusive. Abdominal lymph node biopsy showed histiocytic necrotising lymphadenitis, compatible with Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease (KFD). This benign and self-limiting disease generally resolves following supportive treatment. In this case, remission occurred within 3weeks of initial presentation. KFD is a very uncommon cause of lymphadenopathy, and selective mesenteric involvement is rare. Definitive diagnosis often requires lymph node biopsy. It is important to exclude more common and serious differential diagnoses associated with mesenteric lymphadenopathy, while maintaining a minimally invasive diagnostic approach, before progressing to nodal biopsy.

### Clinical characteristics, outcomes, and interobserver agreement of point-of-care ultrasound detected mesenteric adenitis in nonsurgical pediatric abdominal pain: a retrospective cohort study [^67402c85]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2024). Medium credibility.

RESULTS

Thirty-three subjects were identified by POCUS to have mesenteric adenitis in the setting of nonsurgical abdominal pain presenting to our ED. Most common indications for POCUS were evaluation of suspected appendicitis, suspected intussusception, or undifferentiated abdominal pain. Demographic and clinical characteristics are presented in Table 1 A. Forty-six percent of patients were male. The median age was 9 years old (interquartile range [IQR], 4–14 years) for patients diagnosed with mesenteric adenitis.

TABLE 1A
Clinical characteristics and demographics.

Mesenteric adenitis etiologies are presented in Table 1 B. Figure 1 contains images of mesenteric adenitis detected by POCUS. Figure 2 presents radiology imaging and results after POCUS examinations. Based on all clinical, laboratory, and imaging data reviewed by 2 investigators, just under a third of our patients had primary idiopathic mesenteric adenitis. Fewer than half of patients appeared to have viral gastroenteritis associated with their mesenteric adenitis, with 4 of 17 (23.5%) patients having an associated COVID-19 infection. Two patients in the cohort were found to have extrapulmonary tuberculosis as a cause of the mesenteric adenitis (and).

Radiology imaging after POCUS.

On 4-week clinical follow-up, no patients returned to our ED with a missed surgical abdomen requiring laparotomy. However, there were 3 patients who returned to our ED within 4 weeks from index ED visit for persistent abdominal pain: one who returned a day after the index visit for reevaluation, who had repeat POCUS that confirmed normal appendix and presence of mesenteric adenitis in the area of pain, which was successfully treated with nonopioid auriculotherapy for pain, which resolved a few days after the return ED visit. The second patient was diagnosed with mesenteric adenitis from intestinal tuberculosis by POCUS and subsequent CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis and was treated with antituberculosis therapy on the index ED visit, but was diagnosed with bowel perforation on the second ED visit 2 weeks later (not seen on CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis obtained during the index ED visit) and was admitted for laparotomy. The third patient was subsequently diagnosed with pneumonia on the return ED visit.

Regarding surgical interventions for small bowel neuroendocrine tumors, more specifically with respect to lymph node dissection, NANETS 2017 guidelines recommend to decide on resecting the root of the mesentery nodes based on the operative findings, and avoid performing resection if compromise of the mesenteric vessels is likely with removing these nodes.

### Mesenteric granulomas independently predict long-term risk of surgical recurrence in Crohn's disease [^453fb0a1]. Colorectal Disease (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Medical treatment is the main strategy for achieving disease control in Crohn's disease (CD), but the lifetime risk of CD‐related complications that require surgical intervention is still high 1. Owing to the use of thiopurines and biologicals as well as interventional endoscopy, the 5‐year risk of undergoing surgery after diagnosis has significantly declined and is currently around 30% 2. This is partly due to the fact that the gap between diagnosis and initiation of anti‐tumour necrosis factor (anti‐TNF) therapy has decreased 3. Recently, several studies have suggested a favourable outcome with regard to endoscopic and surgical recurrence in patients who receive postoperative anti‐TNF therapy 4, 5, 6, 7. However, these studies were conducted mainly after index ileocolic resection and comprise relatively small sample sizes, warranting further proof‐of‐concept work. Additionally, immunosuppression bears the risk of infection and other adverse events. Therefore, an improved risk assessment for surgical recurrence would potentially allow a more patient‐tailored selection of postoperative immunosuppression.

Several established risk factors such as age, smoking and prior resection contribute to the risk of endoscopic disease recurrence and can only be partially influenced by clinicians 8, 9. Granulomas have been postulated as objective histological indicators of disease severity and thus might indicate an increased risk of postoperative endoscopic and surgical recurrence. However, results remain inconclusive in the available literature 10, 11, 12. These discrepant findings might be due to a lack of differentiation between granuloma site (e.g. intestinal or mesenteric). In a recent work by Li et al. 11, postoperative recurrence in 194 patients who underwent index ileocaecal resection for CD‐related complications was analysed according to granuloma site. The authors identified mesenteric lymph node granulomas as an independent prognostic factor for endoscopic as well as surgical recurrence, while intestinal granulomas did not prove valuable as a prognostic factor. These findings are of great interest, as lymphatic vessels are altered in CD and might play a key role in pathogenesis 13. Moreover, mesenteric resection has recently been suggested to potentially reduce surgical recurrence rates 14. Unfortunately, the generalizability of results from index ileocaecal resection is limited. In addition, the utilization of postoperative immunosuppression was relatively low in the published literature. Thus, more data on the prognostic value of objective histological hallmarks in a more general, well‐characterized population are warranted.

Given the available data, we hypothesized that the presence of mesenteric granulomas might serve as an objective marker in a general retrospective cohort of patients and independently predict the risk of surgical recurrence.

### Intestinal ultrasound measurement of bowel wall thickness can be used as a sole marker for defining anti-TNF maintenance therapy failure in Crohn's disease [^6366f88d]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

BWF assesses the hyperemia of the bowel wall and is evaluated using color Doppler. Increased vascular signal in the submucosa that penetrates the muscularis propria has been identified as a significant marker of inflammation in patients with CD, and a heightened signal is predictive of more severe disease.

We demonstrated that increased BWF is significantly associated with treatment failure, although its impact on drug discontinuations was less prominent. This finding can be attributed to the presence of fibrosis in the involved intestinal loops, translated into an IUS image of increased BWT without an increase in BWF.

The data on the prevalence and clinical impact of mesenteric fat hypertrophy on disease severity and management are limited. Mesenteric fat hypertrophy was previously reported to be correlated to biochemical and clinical activity of CD and to findings of increased BWT and extraintestinal complications. In quiescent CD, mesenteric fat hypertrophy was not correlated with disease relapse. In this study, mesenteric fat hypertrophy was significantly associated with therapy failure and drug discontinuation, highlighting the significance of this ultrasonic parameter of disease activity.

BWS represents the finding of partially or extensively disrupted bowel wall layering. The most common definition relates to a limited hypoechoic disruption or total loss of BWS. In our cohort, the therapy failure group and drug discontinuation group had significantly higher rates of BWS loss in the univariate analysis. However, this effect was lost in the multivariate analysis.

Regional mesenteric lymphadenopathy detected by IUS is a common but nonspecific sonographic finding in CD and could be linked to young age, early disease, and the presence of extramural complications (abscesses or fistulae). However, the relation of this sign to disease behavior remains poorly investigated. In this study, we did not find a significant correlation between lymph node enlargement on IUS and therapy failure or drug discontinuation.

The significant correlation of BWT with BWF and fat hypertrophy highlights their interrelated roles in the ultrasonographic features of CD. However, BWT emerged as the most significant parameter in a stepwise regression analysis, demonstrating its robustness as a correlate of treatment failure. BWT alone is sufficient to define the risk of treatment failure, as BWF and fat hypertrophy were not included in the model due to their lack of statistical significance. This finding highlights BWT's unique correlative power and supports its use as a singularly reliable marker in clinical practice for assessing and managing CD treatment outcomes.

### AGA clinical practice update on sclerosing mesenteritis: commentary [^55e3d491]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2025). High credibility.

Sclerosing mesenteritis — biopsy indications and imaging guidance: if the imaging is classic for sclerosing mesenteritis and there are no concerns for cancer, then biopsy is unnecessary before initiating treatment; however, biopsy should be considered when features are concerning for malignancy, including associated lymph nodes > 1 cm, lymph nodes with SUVmax ≥ 3.0 on 18FDG PET/CT, lymphadenopathy in another intra-abdominal location, and spiculated, retracted, calcified, or invasive appearance with absence of central halo sign. In patients with such features, 18FDG-PET/CT is helpful for characterization and to identify accessible nodes for biopsy. IgG4-related sclerosing mesenteritis can appear invasive with lymphadenopathy, and biopsy is generally required to make this diagnosis and to exclude malignancy.

Infectious Etiologies

HIV

Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a lentivirus that causes progressive immunodeficiency through the gradual destruction of CD4 + T-lymphocytes, resulting in the development of opportunistic infections, malignancies, and other complications. Currently, in the USA, there are 16,350 yearly deaths from AIDS-related illnesses.

Lymphadenopathy is one of the more common manifestations of HIV and can occur as a direct effect of HIV itself or secondarily from opportunistic infections and/or HIV-related malignancies. In tuberculosis-endemic regions, mycobacterial infections are the most frequent cause whereas reactive lymphadenopathy is more common in non-endemic regions. Reactive HIV adenopathy — or persistent generalized lymphadenopathy (PGL) — is the result of a series of nodal histologic changes that the virus induces, characterized by concurrent reactive follicular hyperplasia and lysis early on with subsequent follicular regression and finally lymphocyte depletion. PGL is seen in up to 50–70% of HIV patients. Lymph nodes are typically symmetric and painless and most commonly involve cervical, submandibular, and axillary chains. Mesenteric, retroperitoneal, and inguinal lymph nodes may be involved as well. Significant hilar and/or mediastinal lymphadenopathy is rare.

PGL does not have a characteristic imaging appearance. Lymph nodes are discrete, homogeneous, and less than 1.5 cm in size. Calcifications, perinodal infiltration, and nodal necrosis are uncharacteristic. Lymph nodes appear isodense to muscle on non-contrast CT and homogeneously enhance with contrast (Fig. 2a). On MRI, they are T1-hypointense, T2-hyperintense, and similarly enhance to those on CT.

### Strongyloides stercoralis mesenteric lymphadenopathy: clue to the etiopathogenesis of intestinal pseudo-obstruction in HIV-infected patients [^3f48f95f]. Annals of Diagnostic Pathology (2006). Low credibility.

Mesenteric lymph node involvement in Strongyloides stercoralis hyperinfective states, described as an autopsy finding, remains a relatively poorly recognized and possibly underreported, antemortem phenomenon. Furthermore, the occurrence of S stercoralis mesenteric lymphadenopathy as a tocsin of bowel strongyloidiasis and the clue to the cause of intestinal pseudo-obstruction are undescribed. We report S stercoralis mesenteric lymphadenopathy and intestinal pseudo-obstruction in 5 HIV seropositive male patients, 21 to 42 years, who presented with abdominal pain and variable vomiting, diarrhea, and constipation. All were pale, pyrexial, and emaciated with abdominal distension. The preoperative diagnosis was intestinal obstruction. Poor clinical response on conservative therapy necessitated laparotomy. Dilated small bowel loops, ascites, and mesenteric lymphadenopathy were consistently noted; a diagnosis of pseudo-obstruction due to underlying tuberculosis or lymphoma was made. The mesenteric lymph nodes were biopsied. The pertinent nodal features were a dense infiltrate of eosinophils, eosinophil microabscesses and degranulation, a focal Splendore-Hoeppli phenomenon, and randomly disposed, but elusive, S stercoralis filariform larvae. Clinical deterioration confirmed intestinal complications at repeat laparotomy. Intestinal resections were performed in 4 patients; histopathologic appraisal confirmed intestinal strongyloidiasis. All patients died within 3 to 7 days after surgery. Heightened awareness of S stercoralis mesenteric lymphadenopathy as a sentinel of intestinal strongyloidiasis and etiopathogenetic clue of intestinal pseudo-obstruction may allow timely diagnosis and medical treatment and avoidance of further surgery, potentially reducing the long-term morbidity associated with S stercoralis hyperinfection.

A previously healthy 74-year-old woman was admitted with vespertine fever, tremors, shivers and loss of appetite within the previous month. Blood tests revealed an elevated C reactive protein serum level. Serologies for infection were negative. Blood cultures grew no organisms. Colonoscopy revealed normal findings. CT showed typical findings of mesenteric panniculitis with infiltration of mesenteric fat that was circumscribed by hyperattenuating capsule and contained enlarged homogenous lymph nodes. The histopathological analysis from mesenterium revealed non-specific signs of chronic inflammation. On institution of prednisolone, the clinical symptoms subsided, and we replaced it with azathioprine after 1month. After 12 months of therapy, the patient remained asymptomatic, normalised the serological inflammatory markers and repeat CT revealed normal mesenteric fat.

### General rules… [^e3c845f6]. training.seer.cancer.gov (2025). Medium credibility.

- Record involved regional lymph nodes from the pathology report, if it is available, when the patient receives no radiation or systemic treatment prior to surgery.
- If there is a discrepancy between clinical information and pathologic information about the same lymph nodes, the pathologic information takes precedence. Example: Axillary lymphadenopathy stated as "suspicious for involvement" noted on physical exam. After axillary dissection, all lymph nodes are negative. Code CS Lymph Nodes as 0, no regional lymph node involvement.
- If there is direct extension of the primary tumor into a regional lymph node, record the involved node in this field.
- If the patient receives preoperative systemic therapy or radiation therapy, code the farthest involved regional lymph nodes, whether this is based on information prior to surgery or following treatment.
- Use code 00 for lymph node involvement when the CS Extension is coded in situ, even if no lymph nodes are removed, since "in situ" by definition means noninvasive. If there is evidence of nodal involvement associated with a tumor described as in situ, it would indicate that an area of invasion was simply missed, and it is NOT an in situ lesion.
- For solid tumors, the terms "fixed" or "matted" and "mass in the hilum, mediastinum, retroperitoneum, and/or mesentery" are considered involvement of lymph nodes.
- Any other terms, such as "palpable, " "enlarged, " "visible swelling, " "shotty, " or "lymphadenopathy" should be ignored unless there is a statement of involvement by the clinician.
- When size of involved regional lymph nodes is required, code from pathology report, if given.
- Code the size of the metastasis, not the entire node, except as noted in site-specific instructions. The size of the metastasis within the lymph node can be inferred if the size for the entire node falls within one of the codes; for example a single involved node 1. 5 cm in size can be coded to "single lymph node less than 2 cm" because the metastasis cannot be larger than

1. 5 cm.

### The CT appearances of sclerosing mesenteritis and associated diseases [^3027b851]. Clinical Radiology (2006). Low credibility.

Sclerosing mesenteritis is characterized by non-specific inflammation of the mesenteric fat associated with variable amount of fibrosis. The aetiology is unclear; the pathogenesis is obscure, and even its nomenclature remains variable. It is a rare condition with imaging features that can be mistaken either for a mesenteric neoplasm or for a wide variety of non-neoplastic inflammatory conditions. Knowledge of the imaging features of this condition may prevent unwarranted aggressive therapy. This review discusses the pathogenesis, clinical manifestations of this condition, as well as illustrating the characteristic computed tomography (CT) features of sclerosing mesenteritis. A rational approach to the differential diagnosis is discussed.

Abdomen

Abdominal TB can be developed as direct involvement (via ingestion of infected lung secretions, infected unpasteurized dairy products, or infected undercooked meats) or at the time/or after the primary lung infection via spreading the lymphatic/hematologically from a focus elsewhere in the body. TB can affect all abdominal organs and tissues. Clinical manifestations are nonspecific and depend on the organ involved, the extent of the affected site, and the duration of the disease (acute, chronic, or acute upon chronic). In general, clinical features may include fever (40–70%), pain (80–95%), weight loss (40–90%), ascites, diarrhea, anorexia, malaise, and bowel obstruction.

Abdominal lymphadenopathy

Abdominal lymphadenopathy is the most common abdominal TB involvement, seen in 55–66% of patients. CT is observed as group-forming, round-shaped, and centrally hypodense lymph nodes with and without calcification (Figs. 23, 24).

Follicular lymphoma stage I or stage II (contiguous) — management and surveillance are as follows: Involved-site radiation therapy (ISRT) (24–30 Gy) is the preferred treatment option; initiation of systemic therapy can improve failure-free survival (FFS), but has not been shown to improve overall survival (OS). ISRT in combination with anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody (mAb) with or without chemotherapy is included as an alternate option, and anti-CD20 mAb with or without chemotherapy can be considered in selected patients with bulky intra-abdominal or mesenteric stage I disease; observation may be appropriate in circumstances where potential toxicity of ISRT or systemic therapy outweighs potential clinical benefit. No further treatment is necessary for patients achieving complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) to initial therapy, and clinical follow-up with a complete history and physical exam and laboratory assessment is recommended every 3 to 6 months for the first 5 years, and then annually thereafter; surveillance imaging with CT scans can be performed no more than every 6 months up to the first 2 years following completion of treatment, and then no more than annually thereafter. Patients with disease not responding to initial therapy with ISRT should receive treatment as described for stage III or IV disease; patients with disease not responding to initial therapy with anti-CD20 mAb with or without chemotherapy should be treated with second-line or subsequent therapy, and rebiopsy to rule out histologic transformation is recommended prior to the initiation of second-line or subsequent therapy.

Adenocarcinoma is uncommon (only 0.4% of all GI tract tumors) but is the most common malignant tumor of the duodenum. It is most often sporadic, although associations with Familial Adenomatous Polyposis, Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, and Crohn's disease (CD) have been reported.

In UGIS, it may manifest as an annular constricting wall thickening or a polypoid or ulcerative mass. "Apple-core" lesions are a classical finding.

CT reflects the same findings seen in the UGI series. It usually manifests as a soft-tissue attenuation thickening of the duodenal wall with enhancement (Fig. 1 a–d). It most frequently arises in the periampullary area (Fig. 1 d, e) and is rare in the bulb. In contrast with lymphoma, adenocarcinoma typically causes obstruction. When it involves the D2, there might be common bile duct (CBD) obstruction (Fig. 1 d, e). Perilesional adenopathy is frequent at the time of diagnosis (Fig. 1 a–c) and 5–40% of the patients have distant metastases or peritoneal seeding at presentation.

There is encasement of the superior mesenteric artery (curved arrow) and tumor thrombosis of the superior mesenteric vein (arrowhead), rendering the lesion surgically unresectable. There is also periduodenal fat stranding and adenopathy (circle). Abdominal CT (d) of another case of duodenal carcinoma with an ulcerated mass at D2 (arrows). Abdominal CT of yet another case of duodenal carcinoma (e); there is circumferential duodenal thickening (arrows) which caused luminal stenosis with proximal dilatation (asterisk). MRCP of another patient (f) showing a polypoid duodenal lesion (curved arrow) that caused CBD dilatation (arrow), which proved to be a duodenal adenocarcinoma

Differentiation between adenocarcinoma of the duodenum and other malignant tumors of the ampulla, pancreas, and common bile duct, with duodenum invasion, could be extremely difficult.

### Why does my patient have lymphadenopathy or splenomegaly? [^64a525be]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Lymph node or spleen enlargement may be innocent or the first sign of a serious disorder. Lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly can be found in symptomatic or asymptomatic patients. Lymph node enlargement in a single region or multiple sites can be seen in various diseases, including infections, noninfectious inflammatory conditions, or malignancies; a similar differential diagnosis applies to splenomegaly, but splenomegaly can also be caused by vascular abnormalities and hemolysis. Frequently, lymphadenopathy is detected incidentally during screening examinations or imaging procedures. This review focuses on causes of lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly and an appropriate diagnostic approach to patients with lymphadenopathy or splenomegaly.

### Small bowel imaging in Crohn's disease patients [^92bd3e03]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

A systematic review comparing MRE and CTE in the evaluation of SB CD demonstrated their role in the correct identification of disease activity. The pooled sensitivity for detecting active SB CD was 87.9% for MRE and 85.6% for CTE. The pooled specificity was 81.2% for MRE and 83.6% for CTE. Another study by Paquet et al demonstrated that the radiological features of wall thickness, mesenteric fat stranding, mesenteric lymphadenopathy and mesenteric abscess positively correlated with the histological inflammatory activity score.

### Tuberculosis versus lymphoma in the abdominal lymph nodes: a comparative study using contrast-enhanced MRI [^d0daa093]. European Journal of Radiology (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose

The purpose of this study was to determine the differential characteristics on MRI between tuberculosis and lymphoma in abdominal lymph nodes.

Materials and Methods

We conducted a retrospective analysis for the counter, size, signal intensity, enhancement patterns, and anatomic distribution of lymph nodes in 57 consecutive patients with documented tuberculosis (28 patients; 49.1%) and newly diagnosed, untreated lymphoma (29 patients; 50.9%).

Results

Twenty-four cases (85.7%) in the tuberculosis group were hyperintense on T2-weighted images and either hypointense or isointense on T1-weighted images with respect to the abdominal wall muscle. All cases in the lymphoma group were hyperintense on T2-weighted images and isointense on T1-weighted images with respect to the abdominal wall muscle. Concerning the main anatomic distribution of lymph nodes, the lymph nodes in the lower paraaortic region were more frequently involved in the lymphoma group (48.3%) than in tuberculosis (17.9%, p < 0.05). Moreover, mesenteric lymph nodes were more often involved in tuberculosis (32.1%) than in lymphoma (6.9%, p < 0.05). Tuberculous lymphadenopathy showed predominantly peripheral enhancement, frequently with a multilocular appearance; whereas lymphomatous adenopathy often demonstrated uniform homogeneous enhancement (all p < 0.001).

Conclusion

Contrast-enhanced MRI can be useful in differentiation between these two entities.

### Neurofibromatosis type 1: a diagnostic mimicker at CT [^3d76bf6e]. Radiographics (2001). Low credibility.

Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is the most common of the phakomatoses and has a variety of localized or, more frequently, systemic manifestations throughout the thorax, abdomen, pelvis, and extremities. Classic computed tomographic (CT) findings in NF1 with thoracic involvement include small, well-defined subcutaneous neurofibromas, focal thoracic scoliosis, posterior vertebral scalloping, enlarged neural foramina, and characteristic rib abnormalities due to bone dysplasia or erosion from adjacent neurofibromas. However, more atypical manifestations are occasionally seen, and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging can be useful in equivocal cases. NF1 with abdominopelvic involvement tends to arise in the retroperitoneal, mesenteric, and paraspinal regions; it may be quite extensive and therefore difficult to distinguish from adenopathy at CT. The multiplanar capabilities of MR imaging, particularly with T2 weighting, make this modality helpful in evaluating affected patients and making the diagnosis. The classic peripheral manifestations of NF1 include limb hemihypertrophy, pseudarthrosis, peripheral nerve neurofibromas, and subcutaneous common and plexiform neurofibromas. In some cases of NF1, imaging findings are inconclusive, and biopsy and subsequent pathologic analysis are required. Familiarity with the various manifestations of NF1 in different anatomic locations is important in making the diagnosis and optimizing postdiagnostic treatment.

### AGA clinical practice update on sclerosing mesenteritis: commentary [^0c5674f8]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2025). High credibility.

Sclerosing mesenteritis — follow-up imaging recommendations and risk data: published recommendations vary from no repeat imaging to annual repeating examinations up to 5 years. In a meta-analysis of 4 case-control studies an increased risk of cancer was not detectable, but another study reported a small long-term increased risk of lymphoma in those without initial features of malignancy, with 80% detectable in the first year. During follow-up imaging, if any features concerning for malignancy occur, biopsy should be performed. For asymptomatic cases without initial features concerning for associated malignancy, we suggest that patients be followed with annual CT scans for 2 years to ensure stability, and thereafter performed for concerning symptoms.

### Clinical and radiological features of extra-pulmonary sarcoidosis: a pictorial essay [^5a30b9f2]. Insights Into Imaging (2016). Low credibility.

Lymphatic and peritoneal sarcoidosis

Lymphatic abnormalities have been already described as abdominal manifestations of sarcoidosis, consisting of "lymphadenopathy or increased number of normal sized nodes"; lymph nodes are generally 1–2 cm in size. In a previous experience, abdominal adenopathy was reported in approximately 30% of patients; in these case series, adenopathy was defined as "two or more nodes with a short axis diameter greater than 6 mm".

Enlarged nodes can be observed in different locations: in the periportal region, close to the liver hilus (Fig. 9), or between portal vein and vena cava. They can be found adjacent to the celiac trunk or pancreas (Fig. 10), or in a paraaortic disposition. Lymph nodes are also found around iliac vessels, or in the mesentery. A diffuse abdominal nodes involvement can be observed (Fig. 11). Necrosis or calcifications are rare in sarcoidosis.

Fig. 9
A 66-year-old female patient affected by sarcoidosis, which involves mediastinal and abdominal lymph nodes (histologically proven). Unenhanced abdominal CT image (Fig. 9a) demonstrate enlarged lymph nodes (white arrows), located in perihepatic region and close to the liver hilus; inside these lymph nodes, very small calcifications are recognizable (black arrowheads). Chest CT-scan shows mediastinal lymphadenopathy, with some punctate calcifications (white arrowhead on Fig. 9b). After contrast administration, both CT and MRI acquisitions show inhomogeneous enhancement of enlarged lymph nodes (white arrowheads on Fig. 9c and d)

Autoimmune Disorders: Systemic Lupus Erythematosus

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an idiopathic autoimmune inflammatory disease. It is characterized by the presence of autoreactive immune cells and autoantibodies, which, in turn, results in immune complex formation, altogether leading to an immunologically mediated multisystemic inflammatory reaction with vascular, perivascular, and peripheral tissue damage and immune cell infiltration, often combined with complement and immunoglobulin deposition.

SLE predominately affects women of childbearing age and is most prevalent in African Americans, American Indians, and Alaska Natives. Patients present with constitutional symptoms and/or organ-specific involvement with mucocutaneous and musculoskeletal manifestations being the most common. Leukopenia and thrombocytopenia occur in 50% of patients. Though non-specific, a positive anti-nuclear antibody (ANA) test is seen in > 95% of patients.

While not considered a diagnostic criterion, lymphadenopathy is a common and non-specific feature of SLE, seen in 23–34% of patients with a female predominance. Lymph nodes are mildly enlarged, painless, and soft. SLE patients with lymphadenopathy have, on average, higher rates of constitutional symptoms, mucocutaneous involvement, hepatosplenomegaly, anti-DNA titer levels, lower complement levels, and overall higher disease activity levels. Rarely, lymphadenopathy may be the presenting feature of SLE.

Morphologic changes of lymph nodes in SLE are extremely diverse with varying degrees of coagulative necrosis and reactive follicular hyperplasia. Lymph node distribution is typically generalized, but most commonly involves cervical lymph nodes followed by axillary, mesenteric, inguinal, and rarely hilar nodes. On imaging, nodes are mildly enlarged, measuring 0.5–1.5 cm, but tend to be smaller than those in rheumatoid arthritis. Lymph nodes are discrete, symmetric, and homogeneous (Fig. 5a, b). Calcifications are rare and may suggest a superimposed granulomatous disease.

### Three-dimensional gadolinium-enhanced MR angiography: applications for abdominal imaging [^744d09a4]. Radiographics (2001). Low credibility.

Three-dimensional (3D) gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) angiography is a versatile technique that combines speed, superb contrast, and relative simplicity. It has a wide range of applications, particularly in the abdomen and pelvis, where superb images of the abdominal aorta and renal arteries are routinely obtained. Aneurysms, atherosclerotic lesions, and occlusions of the major mesenteric arteries are also well depicted. In addition, 3D gadolinium-enhanced MR angiography is ideal for noninvasive evaluation of the systemic and mesenteric veins and can be used to demonstrate parenchymal lesions in the liver, pancreas, kidneys, and other organs. It is also useful in staging genitourinary neoplasms: Parenchymal lesions, venous extension, and adenopathy are all clearly depicted. Three-dimensional gadolinium-enhanced MR angiography can be useful in the preoperative evaluation of potential transplant donors and recipients and in the evaluation of vascular complications following transplantation. Delayed 3D acquisitions of the kidneys, ureters, and bladder can be performed routinely to generate gadolinium-enhanced urograms and demonstrate obstruction, delayed function, filling defects, and masses. A variety of methods for increasing the speed and improving the resolution of 3D acquisition are currently under investigation. These include novel imaging and reformatting techniques and the use of intravascular contrast agents with much longer vascular half-lives.

### Sclerosing mesenteritis [^a050b108]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Sclerosing mesenteritis is a rare non-neoplastic disorder characterized by fat necrosis, chronic inflammation, and fibrosis typically of the small bowel mesentery. Our understanding of this disorder is limited by its rarity as well as inconsistent terminology used across the literature. While prior abdominal surgery or trauma, autoimmunity, infection, ischemia, and malignancy have been suggested to be involved in the pathogenesis of the disorder, it remains poorly understood. The clinical course of sclerosing mesenteritis is generally benign with a large proportion of patients diagnosed incidentally on imaging obtained for other indications. In a subset of patients, symptoms may arise from a mass effect on the bowel, lymphatics, or vasculature resulting in bowel obstruction, chylous ascites, or mesenteric ischemia. Symptomatic patients should be treated with a combination of corticosteroid and tamoxifen as first-line therapy based on retrospective case series and experience in other fibrosing disorders. Surgical intervention may be required in those with persistent obstruction despite conservative treatment, though complete resection of the mass is often not feasible given intimate involvement with the mesenteric vasculature. A careful use of terminology and communication between the radiologist, pathologist, and clinicians in the care of these patients will be essential to future efforts at understanding this disease.

### Management of immune-related adverse events in patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy: ASCO guideline update… [^2ee05e80]. ASCO (2021). Medium credibility.

3Variable onsets have been described for the different toxicities, from early occurrence within days to delayed onset up to 26 weeks, with a median onset of approximately 40 days. 3 Guideline Questions. Presenting symptoms related to immune therapy–induced SCAR may include fever, widespread rash, skin pain, skin sloughing, facial or upper-extremity edema, pustules, blisters, or erosions. 69and care should be taken with NSAID use in this setting. There is a lot of similarity between ICPi-induced colitis and inflammatory bowel disease. 72Computed tomography findings including mesenteric vessel engorgement; bowel wall thickening; and fluid-filled colonic distention. 135, 148It can present as reactivation of pre-existing paraneoplastic polymyositis or dermatomyositis or as a de novo myositis.

The main symptom of inflammatory myositis is weakness, primarily in the proximal extremities, with difficulties in standing up, lifting arms, and moving around. In severe cases, patients can complain of myalgia as well. Patients with de novo myositis do not develop the typical rash seen with paraneoplastic dermatomyositis. Myositis can have a fulminant necrotizing course with rhabdomyolysis and can involve the myocardium, in which case it requires urgent treatment to avoid fatal complications. 149, 150Patients who present with concomitant myocarditis and/or myasthenia gravis have an ominous prognosis with high mortality rates. 151 152Management and treatment principles are similar to those reported for other ICPi-induced rheumatic syndromes. 155The median peak serum creatinine was 4. 5 mg/dL.

### AGA clinical practice update on the role of intestinal ultrasound in inflammatory bowel disease: commentary [^33ad962b]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2024). High credibility.

Intestinal ultrasound (IUS) for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is performed with an initial convex transducer survey followed by linear transducer assessment, with the primary measure of disease activity including bowel wall thickness and bowel wall hyperemia by color Doppler; additional features indicating more severe disease include inflammatory mesenteric fat, loss of bowel wall stratification, and surrounding lymphadenopathy, and IUS can identify complications such as strictures, fistulae, sinus tracts, phlegmons, and abscesses. IUS is accurate for detecting small intestinal and colonic inflammation, but it has less accuracy in defining the location of disease in the mid to proximal small bowel and in assessing proximal small bowel strictures and wall inflammation.

Amyloidosis in lymph node that is FDG-avid is an unusual diagnosis. FDG PET/CT showed the presence of multifocal lymphadenopathy mainly axillary with a mesenteric mass. Surgical lymph node biopsy with histological examination confirmed the diagnosis of amyloidosis in a 64-year-old woman with an initial left axillary pain. Amyloidosis should be considered on the differential diagnosis for a FDG-avid lymphadenopathy. Other differential diagnosis usually includes malignancy such as lymphoma or metastatic disease, infection, or sterile inflammation.

### Tuberculosis revisted: classic imaging findings in childhood [^48bf1ff5]. Pediatric Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Abdominal tuberculosis

Despite modern technologies and developments, diagnosis of abdominal TB still represents a significant challenge. Imaging relies on all radiology modalities, including radiography, fluoroscopy, US, CT and MRI, and depends on the presenting symptoms and availability of the imaging equipment, which is often limited, especially in low- and middle-income countries. Abdominal radiography is often non-specific, but may show an abnormal gas pattern, bowel wall thickening and dilatation or separation of the small bowel loops due to an infiltrative process affecting the mesentery and omentum. In case of involvement of solid abdominal organs, organomegaly may be detected. Chest radiography should be performed, as approximately 15–25% of cases with abdominal TB have concomitant pulmonary infection.

Abdominal TB presents with a triad of pain, fever and weight loss, occurring in 54% of patients. Although similar symptoms are seen in other abdominal and gastrointestinal infections, bowel inflammatory disease and abdominal malignancies, presence of the triad should always raise a high suspicion of TB, especially in children living in endemic areas and low- and middle-income countries. Abdominal TB may occur in various forms, including TB lymphadenopathy and peritoneal, gastrointestinal and visceral TB. These are separate entities, but there is usually a combination of various pathologies in the individual infected patient. Multiple intra-abdominal sites are involved in more than 50% of patients with a combination of lymphadenopathy and gastrointestinal involvement being the most common.

In children with single-site involvement, lymphadenopathy is most common, followed by pathology in the ileocecal region. The type of abdominal infection is closely related to the entry point of the tubercle bacilli into the abdominal cavity. Bacteria ingested with infected milk or sputum affect the mucosal layer of the gastrointestinal tract, with formation of epithelioid tubercles in the lymphoid tissue of the submucosa. Progression of infection causes necrosis of the tubercles and ulceration of the overlying mucosa and bowel wall, with further spread of infection into adjacent mesentery, omentum and lymph nodes. The haematogenous route disseminates bacteria from other centres of infection in the body through the blood stream, to solid abdominal organs, such as the liver, spleen or kidneys, lymph nodes and peritoneum. Similarly, the lymphatic system offers an easy route for TB bacilli to enter the abdominal cavity from other infected lymph nodes. Other pathways include direct spread from infected adjacent organs, such as the ovaries or fallopian tubes, spine (in the presence of discitis) or from a collection within the psoas muscle.

### Noninvasive monitoring with bowel ultrasound (NIMBUS) in paediatric inflammatory bowel disease: feasibility in a single centre [^c6262201]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2025). Medium credibility.

Regarding FCP measurement, recent data suggest a topographical effect of disease location on FCP level. In their work evaluating the variation of FCP level in a cohort with heterogenous distribution of disease along the gastrointestinal tract, Ukashi et al. demonstrated that FCP levels significantly diminished in those with proximal disease. Moreover, they noted that patients with colonic disease had a significantly higher FCP level than those with even extensive small bowel involvement. This potential differential gradient in faecal calprotectin, compounded with the possible barriers to bowel wall assessment within the small bowel may explain the lack of correlation in the total and Crohn's disease groups.

There are several advantages of ultrasound over FCP, most importantly that assessment is instantaneous and can be delivered at the point of care. Moreover, compliance with obtaining faecal samples can be variable within the paediatric and young adult cohorts, whereas ultrasound has been demonstrated to be acceptable to patients; within this study and the wider literature. The correlation between BWT and FCP supports the use of ultrasound for quantifying inflammation in colitis. Utilisation of a single measurable parameter, in the form of BWT, could reduce study time as well as inter‐user variability, with BWT having previously been noted to be the most reproducible measure within BUS. The additional correlation demonstrated between loss of bowel wall haustration and faecal calprotectin in our study further indicates that distal, colonic disease was associated with elevated FCP. Moreover, there was a negative association between FCP and intrabdominal lymphadenopathy. Mesenteric lymphadenitis has been demonstrated to be associated with Crohn's disease to a greater extent than UC, which may account for this correlation. Of note, only the terminal ileum was measured within the ultrasound scoring system and as a result, small bowel disease may not be reported. This, along with the small sample size, limits the interpretation of these findings. Moreover, variation in time from FCP measurement to BUS means these findings must be interpreted with trepidation.

### The medical mystery of the fatty mesentery [^eebe3d82]. BMJ Case Reports (2012). Medium credibility.

An 86-year-old gentleman presented with a 3-month history of nausea, anorexia and excruciating generalised abdominal pain. He had been discharged a week earlier from another hospital. No diagnosis had been made. Clinically the patient was feverish, with a palpable, tender and poorly defined mass in his epigastrium. He had elevated inflammatory markers and deranged electrolytes. An ultrasound scan revealed thickening and hyper echogenicity of the small bowel mesentery. A CT scan was recommended; this revealed a diagnosis of mesenteric panniculitis. First described in 1924, mesenteric panniculitis is a benign inflammatory condition of the bowel mesentery. With only a handful of cases being reported in the UK, the authors thought that they had come across a rarity. This case report focuses on the aetiology, diagnosis, pathology and treatment of mesenteric panniculitis. By examining the literature, the authors also suggest that it is relatively underdiagnosed and may be more common than first thought.
